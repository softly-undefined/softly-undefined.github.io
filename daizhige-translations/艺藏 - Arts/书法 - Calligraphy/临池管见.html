      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div>The opening section states: Scholars first possessed awareness, then culture and art, and art is at the end. Ritual, music, archery, horsemanship, calligraphy, and arithmetic are all arts, yet calligraphy is at the furthest end. It proceeds from calligraphy, exploring the essence of craftsmanship, discerning the correctness of form and sound. It then confines and corrects the boundaries of propriety, examining the intentions of ancient sages and worthies, and those pursuing the Way may only grasp a small portion of it. It is then abandoned to focus on the learning of characters and paintings, discarding its purpose while pursuing the arrangement of symbols, and yet it remains at the end. My own understanding is shallow and humble, and I struggled with learning; therefore, I observed and copied the style of ancient texts, and when I saw them, I immediately copied them.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a> Having copied for a long time, each form was merely a likeness; after a while, one began to understand its meaning, then surveyed all the existing inscriptions and manuscripts, engaged in mutual examination, and only then did one regulate its laws, follow its method of positioning, examine its use of brushstrokes, and finally understand its spirit. It was only then that one realized it. The ancients’ intention in writing was often beyond the mere strokes and ink; those who sought its meaning could not escape being bound by the strokes and ink, and yet still could not transcend them. Few, if any, who had devoted themselves to it for a long time, gained insights, and then, like a dry stream, simplified the complex and disordered, achieving elegance that was worthy of observation.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a> There were those who considered my opinion worthy of attention, and they entrusted it to the carving tools. I consistently refused, because of my humble account of the circumstances by which I acquired my occupation, and my particular inclinations, and then named it “The Keeper of the Pool.” Alas, Confucius and Wang Yang fell, and countless people were replaced by those with names written on books, yet few achieved fame through a single skill! I have never truly mastered the classics, and after decades of effort, I can only vaguely grasp their general outlines; therefore, I proceed from the understanding of skills to further advancement. Truly, the essence of the classics is not easily grasped; what difficulty there is! The world now values only fleeting trends and trivial reputations, without seeking harmony with the ancients—this can only lead to ruin.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a> In the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han, in the sixth month of the summer of the Wuding year, Xing Lian began to write. Previously, people governed by knotting strings, and from the time of Fuxi, eight trigrams were drawn, and writing began. Therefore, the ancients created characters, calling them “characters and paintings,” referring to the division and boundaries. *Li Ye* defines “di” (涂) as “it emerges from the right and is then returned,” and “painting” (邱) refers to it.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a> To follow the Way, one must draw according to its rules. The name’s explanation: Since the Way originates from the right, it is called “Hua Qiu” (drawing in the fields), and people still favor the right hand. Therefore, when drawing, one should use the right hand. Whether in seal script, cursive script, regular script, semi-cursive script, or cursive script, one must never forget the meaning of the character “Hua.”<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a> The brush, when used for painting, will never be crooked, never be uneven, while the characters themselves exhibit a thousand variations, refined through painstaking effort and skillful technique, from which it originates. Afterwards, posterity does not call it painting, but writing. “Write” has a double meaning: “Write” as in “to place objects” (referring to the initial act of placing the brush and ink).<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a> The *Yueh Shu* states: “To write, it is to transmit. To ‘set’ (置者), one sets the form of objects; to ‘transmit’ (输者), one transmits my heart. These two meanings do not contradict each other, therefore the character is a drawing of the heart. If one can only set the form of objects and cannot transmit my heart, then the meaning of drawing and writing would be lost.”<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a> The fault lies not in the failing of calligraphy. Characters and paintings originate from the same craftsman; characters are valued for their writing, and paintings are likewise valued for their writing. When calligraphy penetrates into painting, the painting is invariably perfect; when painting methods are incorporated into calligraphy, the calligraphy is invariably sublime. Therefore it is said: a good calligrapher must be a good painter, and a good painter must be a good calligrapher.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a> Those who excel in calligraphy and painting, such as Mi Xiangyang, Ni Yunlin, Zhao Songxue, Shen Shitian, Wen Hengshan, and Dong Sibei, possess a singular ability. Their calligraphy and paintings demonstrate a single-minded application, a consistent understanding of principles, with calligraphy containing paintings and paintings containing calligraphy. Mi Yuanzhang said: “Dongpo is a master of the brush character.” He himself said he was “brushing” characters.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a> This is merely surpassing those who came before, a saying of striving for perfection, not implying inability to write, but actually copying and drawing to form characters. From桧 onward, there is no shame. Those who followed and wrote sought to emulate the brushwork and drawings of Su Shi and Mi Fu, but it was unattainable.<br/>
<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a> Using his saying, I have heard of it. Some say ‘correct the锋,’ others say ‘middle锋,’ others say ‘concealed锋,’ others say ‘forthcoming锋,’ others say ‘lateral锋,’ others say ‘flattened锋.’ Those who know the classics find it within their minds, their words are clear and distinct, while those who know but do not know, each hold to their own view, and they speak of it repeatedly. Ultimately, they gather disputes and conflicting opinions, unable to arrive at a definitive judgment. This is because they follow the instructions of previous generations, not bothering to elaborate, and do not venture to expand upon them. Afterwards, those who follow imitate the wise ancients, understanding only half and failing to pursue to the extreme, and therefore, they contemplate it.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a> Liǔ Gōngquán yuē: Heart being correct, the brush is correct; the brush being correct, the brush’s edge becomes easily correct. The central edge is the true straight edge; it need not be explained. Yet I have a different saying about this: the brush handle is made of bamboo, which is naturally straight and does not curve; its nature is firm. If one wishes to make it straight, it is ultimately made straight. The brush head is made of hair, which is naturally easy to raise and easy to lower; its nature is yielding. Yet, to make it straight, it is difficult to preserve its not bending.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a> If it cannot be achieved through urging and persuasion, the brushstick is firm and the brushhead lies still, does this represent a central strategy? Or perhaps one exerts extreme effort to control the brushhead, confining the sharpness within the tip, pressing the hair against the blank paper, like using chopsticks to draw characters. In this case, the brush is correct, balanced. However, the sharpness is already lost, and can it still be called sharpness? Some say: this is a method of concealing sharpness. Ask: does concealing sharpness mean concealing it within the brushhead? Or does it mean concealing it within the character and painting? It is a saying that people already know. Knowing it and saying that only concealing sharpness is the central strategy, and that the central strategy does not involve not concealing sharpness, is also incomplete.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a> To conceal the sharp edge, the method of the central edge is like a craftsman drilling wood; first, one extends and moves the hands in four directions, then it is possible to penetrate the wood in three parts. Once it is established, the drill has already penetrated deeply, then one holds it steadily in a straight line. The same applies to characters. Those that accurately capture the central edge can also conceal the sharp edge; like a needle drawing sand, like an inkstone and ink, this is precisely what it is. However, there are also instances where the brushstroke extends beyond its termination, at the points of cessation, at the junctions of the brushstroke and the binding, these also have instances of extending the edge.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a> The brushstroke’s edge emerges, and the brushstroke’s edge also emerges. Though the brushstroke’s edge emerges, it is still the sharpness of the brushpoint itself, then the concealed sharpness and the emerging sharpness are both called the ‘central’ sharpness; one must not exclusively regard the concealed sharpness as the central sharpness. The method of the lateral edge is to take its advantage using lateral movement; this has also existed in the ancient world. If a common brush produces a straight stroke, then it intends for a straight force, and it will inevitably stop at a lack of sharpness.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a> To make the brushstrokes lean to one side, one must intend to lean to the prevailing trend, and only then will it cease. The strings of the zither, when unified, who can hear them? Their principle is one. The painter’s method of rendering stone—three sides are sharp, one must use the leaning edge to achieve it. The brushstroke emerges, and then the stone edge emerges.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a> If one lies prostrate across his brush, then it becomes utterly blurred, and it cannot be used as stone. In short, the method of writing is to first make the wrist flexible and the brush lively, seizing the air, calm and unrestrained, fluent and joyous, purely relying on nature, indescribable, able to use the brush in every way—straight, sideways, following, heavy, light, empty, solid, grasping and fixing, even when drawn out, tight and firm, expanded and open; the whole body is a calculation, entirely relying on the brushpoint and its bristles to direct it, thus achieving perfect harmony. A dull person presses a sticky column against a lute, carves a sword from a raft, and says: “If it is the center, then it is; if it is not, it is not.” This is merely nonsense! Therefore, one knows that even though this relies on the assistance of others, it is also dependent on innate talent; within the Dao, and outside the Dao, there are fixed rules. Even in the minutest details of an art, one must seek to understand the wisdom of others and yet still cannot obtain it.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a> Ah, how difficult! The method of ink—it is both intensely dark as when the subject lives, and exceedingly pale as when it fades. Intense darkness and extreme lightness cannot be achieved with narrow ink; it is clear that ancient seal stones were designed to concentrate ink in small areas. The large brush, when wet, produces a dripping effect, and the two characters “dripping” are deliberately chosen. Wetting the brush also has its own established method.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a> When writing, one must open the brush fully, letting the ink drop into the inkstone, like a pole striking water, so that the ink enters from the brush tip. Thus, the brush is full of ink, and with vigorous strokes, the ink flows out from the brush tip. Conversely, if the ink is merely dropped into the brush, the brush is dry and the ink is sparse. The ancients’ calligraphy and paintings have been passed down for a long time, and after many years, they retain their original vitality, spirit, and brilliance, unerasable. A person unskilled in the use of ink will make it too dark and easily dry, or too pale and thin; within a few years, it will become dull and lifeless.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a> I do not know how to use a brush, and I do not know how to use ink. This matter is difficult for common artisans to understand. It is said by Dong Si Weng that all works on paper should not be trusted with the brush, because if one trusts the brush, there will be no master to guide it, and the lines will easily rise and fall. I believe that trusting the brush too much is not to be overly valued, nor should it be given too much consideration.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a> If one relies on rote memorization, the brushstrokes become stiff, and the brush obeys the mind, then the brush dies. To allow the brush to follow my natural movement, so that we are in harmony, then we become one; this is the way to achieve a harmonious union. And the true essence of characters arises from this. Characters have a certain rhythm, a certain measure, a certain length—one need not fabricate them.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a> The military strategy, through the acceptance of things, is purely natural, reaching the utmost naturalness, and consequently, can change according to one’s will, encompassing all things. It is appropriate for one to maintain this state for a thousand generations.<br/>
<br/>
One must follow the highest principles, obtain them from the middle, and speak of them universally. However, the supreme realm of the world is one that all should strive to reach, yet it is not attainable by all; it depends on one’s talent and action. If one possesses the talent to reach it, then one has truly reached it.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a> Talents cannot reach the heights, and those who reach that level obstruct you, preventing your ascent. This is the limit of learning. Though talent has its limits, scholars cannot naturally attain them; they must ascend to the higher levels. The realms one creates must be developed in a gradual, step-by-step manner, like climbing a ladder, gaining one step at a time.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a> He said: “If one wishes to excel, one must begin from below.” This refers to words that should not be boastful or arrogant. Today’s students of calligraphy, upon first learning to hold the brush, immediately speak of the Jin and Tang dynasties, filling their mouths with the names of Xi Shi and Han Xian. Once they gain some skill, they immediately wish to emulate the Han and Wei dynasties, not only disregarding Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, and Cai Xi, but also those of Ouyang Xun and Xue Yan. They even considered Xi Shi and Han Xian to be insufficient, truly a case of seeking the root and the source, recognizing those who are superior to the highest level! When they finally began to write characters, they produced nothing remarkable. Alas, how could one not ponder this so deeply? I too was once afflicted with this ailment. When I was first learning, I took Ouyang’s style to establish the basic framework; after a long time, the characters became like engraved blocks, and then, because I loved the undulating style of褚, I began to study褚; after a long time, I again worried about exceeding his style, all of this was due to my own ingrained habits and my lack of connection with Ouyang and褚.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a> Subsequently, the eastern regions were extended westward, following one’s own inclinations and responding accordingly. He delighted in composing cursive scripts, taking as his models the collected sacred teachings of Huai Ren, the broken stelae from the Xingfu Temple, and the musical scores of Sun Guoting. He was initially adept at cursive script, but his brushwork was loose and unfocused. He felt as though there was no true mastery. He examined contemporary stone rubbings, finding some degree of success. Then, he reviewed the genuine works of contemporary calligraphers, finding it easier to understand them than to emulate them, yet far more difficult to follow their example. He then lamented that his own learning was far inferior to that of ancient scholars and even to that of contemporary scholars. Therefore, he meticulously studied the brushwork of contemporary calligraphers, frequently observing the works of Dong and Zhao, gaining a deeper understanding. He also studied the inscriptions and manuscripts of Song Dynasty artists, gaining insight into their techniques.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a> He further journeyed to copy the styles of Ou, Yu, Chu, Xue, Yan, Liu, Xu, and Li, and had already begun to discern their respective paths. Then, he ascended again to seek the methods of the Grand General and the Great Commandment; he had already begun to perceive their essential nature. At this point, he suddenly realized the method he had previously employed, and continued to pursue it. He observed that Yan Ru Gong’s calligraphy was the best, because it possessed a natural spontaneity, a grounded realism, and a continuation of the past while opening up the future. It was truly the most admirable. Formerly, it was said: Poetry is best in the works of Zifu, calligraphy in the works of Yan Ru Gong, and the viewing and understanding of both is enough to bring one to a standstill in admiration.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a> This statement is no longer a deception! I have written nothing of substance; I have only repeatedly questioned and gained understanding, sometimes entering, sometimes exiting, and dared not risk three broken arms in this pursuit, yet I have long tasted the bitterness and sweetness of the book. I have taken the book as a report from one who learns to read.<br/>
<br/>
The study of characters requires reverence as its first principle. Whenever one encounters a brush and ink, one should rise and be solemn; this naturally invigorates the spirit, and when one begins to write, one has complete control. There is no reason for the path of writing not to succeed! Superficial erasing, without any true foundation.<br/>
<br/>
The writing of characters must be held with care; those who have some knowledge of calligraphy are all aware of this. Yet, one who wishes to lift the brush but instead turns and hesitates, is lacking in control.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a> The two characters “qīn zòng” are the key to the skill of a calligrapher; without “qīn zòng,” there is no control, and without control, there is no mastery of life and death, let alone the use of a brush. When one is truly awake, the bones become enlightened, and there is no longer the illness of being stiff and immobile on paper. Otherwise, searching and probing with a few strokes of ink, attempting to discern the subtle traces of their movements, is merely a clever imitation of clothing and appearance—a puppet on display; how can this be considered the way?<br/>
<br/>
I, from a young age, observed the stone carvings of renowned figures from the Tang and Song dynasties, regarding the Tang script as like jade and the Song script like crystal. I held this belief without ever explicitly stating its reason. Later, reading Zhu Zi’s *Yilu* (Commentary on the Writings of Confucius), I was astonished when I read that Confucius’s learning was like jade and Mencius’s learning was like crystal; I considered it a perfect analogy. Observing people, objects, learning, and skills in the world, I found that they were all distinct yet flowed from two separate paths, and my perception of them was not greatly different from that of ancient and modern scholars.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a> To begin learning calligraphy, one should merely copy. Copying allows one to grasp the brushstrokes, and copying with lines allows one to understand the structure. When copying for a long time, it is not like seeing many things, understanding much, discussing much, and changing things much. Li Bai learned calligraphy by hanging ancient masters’ writings on the walls, observing their movements and gestures, copying with his heart and hand, grasping their overall meaning.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a> Within this, there are people, and there is I. What is meant by this is: learning that is not pure, has no teacher. Furthermore, there is a saying: poetry does not seek perfection, nor does it marvel at its artistry; natural and unrestrained is my teacher. Ancient people possessed different minds, therefore they were able to rise above others. I once said: copying is merely learning a character among characters; when one understands fully, there is a character within the character, and a character beyond the character, all originating from an empty space and expressing one’s spirit.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a> What dreams did he have regarding those banknotes and paintings? Waste paper and failed strokes, carelessly scattered, often come naturally to hand. Upon encountering fine paper and good brushes, he would sit upright and write openly, yet he invariably finds himself regretting his hand. This is because, firstly, he recklessly rushes across a blank space, pursuing his own ideas without anticipating the difficulty; secondly, he deliberately strives for perfection, limiting himself to preconceived notions, and consequently finds himself clumsy. Furthermore, when attending a gathering for entertainment and writing for guests, he relaxes and writes with ease, and when his inspiration flows, his writing becomes markedly different.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a> To eliminate these shortcomings, the key lies in diligent practice and copious writing during ordinary times, or in responding to matters fully and completely, using a great many sheets of paper. Thus, the skill of the hand becomes more refined, the mind more relaxed, the heart free of distraction, the brush flows effortlessly, and the fingers become one with the objects they depict. In short, whenever there is someone present, the heavens are not complete; it is something one must not forget.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Xu Er’an explained Tang poetry, elucidating it to its fullest extent, commenting on numerous passages upon opening a book, one of which states: “Learning poetry is like a monk wandering without shelter, accumulating the rice of a thousand households to cook a single pot of rice.” I believe learning writing is similarly so. When beginning, one selects brushes with similar characteristics to imitate, and when the strokes begin to align, one should diligently examine the techniques of various masters, discerning their similarities and differences, understanding their entrances and exits, and ultimately integrating and connecting them. With prolonged contemplation, one’s own style naturally emerges.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a> If one attempts to carve a sword from a boat, or follow a gourd’s shape, it is a futile endeavor. Yu Haiyue’s “slave writings” are an example. Ancient scholars wrote, capturing the appearance and then the spirit. Modern writers, however, capture the appearance but lack the spirit. The distance between these two is not something that can be calculated by earthly means. The masters of literature merely exhale through a nostril.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a> Zhao Ji Xian said: Calligraphy constantly changes, the use of the brush is difficult to maintain through the ages, ancient people obtained good copies by diligently studying them for a few times, focusing their efforts, and would become masters. This seems to contradict my previous emphasis on broad observation, but it is unaware that, stemming from a consistent practice of ten thousand things, and ten thousand things converging into one, it always represents a single principle. What is meant by “difficult to maintain through the ages” refers to one who is adept at manipulating ink and brush, avoiding bluntness, like a butcher dissecting a cow, skillfully resolving and responding, as if a blade were at one’s command; this is what is meant by “within it, it is not one’s own strength.”  Failing to understand this point, regardless of how extensively one searches or gathers information, is utterly pointless.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a> It is said: Seeing one bodhisattva bow once, one cannot avoid becoming a foreigner to the Dharma.<br/>
<br/>
All learning should be carefully contemplated, drawing upon the teachings of past sages. Carelessness and superficiality lead to no benefit. I once encountered a commentary on a post by Zhao Wenmin regarding the unchanging nature of calligraphy, which claimed that the styles of Ou, Yu, Xue, and Chu calligraphy were fundamentally different, and that applying Chu calligraphy to the structure of Ou calligraphy was impossible, and then asking if such a thing could be considered eternal. I privately laughed at the absurdity of his misinterpretation. Zhao Wenmin was a leading figure of the early Yuan dynasty; how could he utter words outside of the Dharma! The “eternal” referred to the texture and structure of calligraphy, not the appearance of the script.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a> The brushstroke falls upon the paper, like a bamboo shoot splitting, cleaving through flesh and bone. It exploits the momentum, seizing the opportunity. One must initiate the action with a sudden, forceful throw before it takes flight, vanishing without trace, not adhering to the paper. It seeks life beyond the reach of the brush, and the breath consumes it. Where the brush has reached, the breath is not exhausted, thus enabling ink to be used without depth, flesh without excess, and bone without exposure. Spirit, resonance, and charisma all originate from this. The essence of calligraphy is simply this. The sayings of the learned are merely a general elevation; the ancients did not record their insights in such places.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a> I once obtained this instruction, and did not hesitate to express it repeatedly, and could only describe it to this extent; those with discerning minds will certainly approve it at first. If sought through appearances, it is like a foolish man’s dream!<br/>
<br/>
There are auspicious and inauspicious aspects to the writing of characters, aspects of direction and opposition, rise and fall, lightness and weight, gathering and dispersal, hardness and softness, dryness and wetness, swiftness and slowness, closeness and distance, plumpness and thinness, density and lightness, continuity and severance, freedom and constraint, reception and connection—all of these factors must be considered, and only then can one achieve writing. Otherwise, the ink and the brushes are entirely demonic.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient scholars when writing, would complete a circle with a single stroke, completing a whole form in that single stroke, each creating a distinct style.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a> The Orchid Pavilion used circles, the teachings of the Sage used squares; the two scrolls serve as the model and standard for calligraphy of all ages. To say that circles and squares are the most perfect is indeed true! Ouyang Xun’s large and small characters were all square; the script of Yu Sung was all square and round; Chu style used square for large characters and round for small. Ultimately, both square and round are employed. In terms of structure, the body is square and the application is round; in terms of turning and binding, the interior is square and the exterior is round; in terms of the brush itself, the bone is square and the flesh is round. This is an established principle.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a> Moreover, the physiques of people from the Jin and the Tang dynasties were markedly different: the Jin favored flatness, while the Tang favored length. Considering both the Jin and Tang, it was only the generals of the right army and Lu Gong who lacked such pronounced flatness, and instead embodied perfect roundness. The Jin people sought rhyme, the Tang people sought method, and the Song people sought meaning; all knew this. I believe that the Jin Annals are like the work of immortals, the Tang Annals like the work of sages, and the Song Annals like that of heroes. Those who studied the classics divided themselves into distinct groups, and when they began to write, they already had a clear purpose.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a> Characters possess sinew and bone, blood vessels, flesh and skin, spiritual essence, fat luster, and breath; none may be lacking. Whether genuine regular script or cursive, all should emphasize careful execution. Regular script must exhibit all eight aspects, and ancient scholars, such as Wei Furen, Yi Shao, Ouyang Xiu, Yu Yongxing, Zhi Yongchan, and Yan Rugu, referred to these seven as regular script; the rest were merely genuine script. Regular script is characterized by upright and correct characters, and the use of legal brushstrokes.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a> A calligrapher’s script, though the characters are intertwined, is called “regular script” when the brushstrokes remain consistent. Besides this, there is “cursive script,” “semi-cursive script,” “regular cursive script,” “large cursive script,” and “ink without form” where the meaning is fully expressed, or where the meaning is expressed fully without the ink or brush. In essence, the method is paramount, with spirit serving to support it; thus, allowing the brush to follow one’s intention is without fault.<br/>
<br/>
欧, 虞,褚, 薛 did not rigidly adhere to the *Shuowen* dictionary, just as Han, Liu, Ou, and Su did not fixate on phonetic rules. Emptying all possessions allows the spirit to emerge.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a> Ancient scholars produced standard script, with regular script, block script, and cursive script appearing in numerous errors, arranged arbitrarily. However, Master Lu’s commentary on the proper use of brushstrokes for regular and cursive scripts was meticulously analyzed and clearly explained, specifically designed for the study of brushstrokes in calligraphy, and its use of brushstrokes perfectly aligned with regular script. Recently, young scholars have employed intricate brushwork and elaborate arguments in their writings regarding the arrangement of brushstrokes, yet this is merely a representation of regular script, not genuine regular script. Regular script is like a person standing, with a firmly established base and a naturally strong and upright posture, responding to even slight movements on all sides.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a> If one does not skillfully employ the writer, one will not merely sit or lie upon paper, but will already be crouching upon it. To eliminate this fault, there is no need for any artificial trickery; it is like what Old Master Si said: “When lifting the brush, first raise the brush itself.”  What is meant by “lifting the brush first, raising the brush itself” is essentially a sudden, abrupt movement, with the mind focused on the brush.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a> The brushwork, when it arrives, possesses force; the brushstroke emerges, following the fall and rise, and there is no longer the ailment of rigidity! The ancients said: when the heart is correct, the energy settles; when the energy settles, the wrist comes to life; when the wrist comes to life, the brushhead is active; when the brushhead is active, the ink flows, when the ink flows, the spirit concentrates; when the spirit concentrates, the image flourishes; without intention, everything is intentional; without form, everything is form. This is precisely the fundamental practice of innate beginnings, saving countless words and thoughts of deliberation. What is called “one achieved, one hundred achieved” is precisely this.<br/>
<br/>
The characters themselves have no need of mountains and forests, pavilions and halls. Throughout the ages, calligraphers have often been men of secluded temples; and it is feared that many have spent their entire lives in obscurity. Yet, the transmission of their writing, whether far or near, remains; though each is distinguished by rank and status, when one reaches the point, it cannot be erased. Furthermore, there are those who have studied learning and techniques surpassing the ordinary, yet are obscured by the names of their works.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a> There were, indeed, many who maintained such practices among them. Since the customs of the Tiegue had become established, characters and laws were then treated as a single whole. Wooden dragons and puppets, lacking any spirit or interest, were molded to resemble the styles of ancient grandeur; those who innovated from them subsequently adopted a manner reminiscent of officialdom. Those who studied the academies and libraries pursued a style that mirrored officialdom; those who studied in the mountains and forests adopted a style resembling frontier warfare.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a> All are concealing the correct method behind writing; characters should not be feared for their dispersal, still less for their entanglement. Dispersal leads to a lack of focus, and entanglement prevents release. Ancient writers used connections to reveal structure, and flourishes to reveal imagery.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a> The right army’s writing turned to the left side, its changes bewildering. The claims of ‘appearing broken and then connected,’ ‘possessing the momentum of a slope turning back’ – these are due to its skillful manipulation of separation and combination. Ouyang, Yu, Chu, and Xue each gained its secrets, but Ouyang’s style was particularly prominent. It relies on careful adherence to the upright posture, and loose, expansive strokes. Whether in cursive or regular script, it always exhibits a respectful yielding to the left and right, possessing a flamboyant and unconventional character. Its weapons and objects are vividly depicted, establishing a distinct and unique style. History records that his appearance was unattractive, yet his insight was remarkable. Observe his writings, and you will understand! Scholars gained a fragment of his scale and feathers; from the Tang dynasty to the Jin dynasty, he possessed a clearly defined method.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a> The Yellow Court’s *Huang Ting Jing* and Lu Yu’s *Lun*, Ouyang Xiu’s *Li Quan Ming* and the *Qian Zi Wen*, are all the most accurate of the Nine Palaces. Their essence lies in the precise joining of the segments, with all eight sides fully filled, without any deficiencies within the characters, or protrusions outside them; they always return to a straight and upright center, without any superfluous ornamentation.<br/>
<br/>
The characters possess numerical interpretations, and their primary purpose is to reflect reversals. Reversals are tight and forceful, embodying the contraction and expansion of a coiled spring. Those that are constricted must be released, and those that are stagnant must be opened. Yet, one must also incorporate deliberate slowness with swiftness, and cunning within simplicity, and roundness within squareness. Doubtful and unresolved, the illness lies in starvation. Hasty and impetuous, without restraint, the illness lies in slipping.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a> To obtain a brush, one must follow it; to lose a brush, one must rescue it. Carefully investigate the news, this is how it is obtained. The method of using a brush: if too light, it will float; if too heavy, it will drag. Arrive at just the right degree, then act with confidence. The brilliance of Tang Dynasty artists lies precisely in not being too light or too heavy, rigorously adhering to rules and regulations, yet still producing writing with a spirited style.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a> Chu Hen said: Gold is born in the characters, jade moistens the spaces between them. It is also said: like a needle piercing sand, like an imprint in clay. Yu Yongxing’s calligraphy is like drawing a sword through water, and Yan Lu Gong’s depiction of ancient hairpins and a leaking roof are all due to his masterful brushwork, smoothing out irregularities and achieving a perfect finish. Those who are not skilled in learning do not err by being either too soft or too rigid; nor do they err by being too hasty or too slow.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a> Appearance was archaic and clumsy, yet it fell into decadence; strength was feigned, and it flowed into stubbornness. He did not recognize the need for restraint in his brushwork, and it is not surprising that he distanced himself from the ancients. The ancients said: Joy brings forth the painting of orchids, anger the painting of bamboo, each suited to its nature. I say: In the realm of brush and ink, the fundamental task is to capture the likeness of things, and calligraphy is likewise.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a> Wang Youjun and Yu Sainan possessed a script of elegant and refined character, with a demeanor of tranquility and harmony, brimming with the vitality of spring and summer – what is known as joy. Xu Jihai skillfully employed the “kaìbì” (渴笔 – dry brush technique), and Shi Zhuanggu resembled a furious lion’s gaze upon a stone, a frantic horse galloping to a spring – representing anger. Chu Deng and Yan Changshan, along with Liu Jiayan, produced writings of profound wisdom, reflecting loyalty and righteousness that shone like the sun and moon. Their calligraphy possessed a rigid and forceful spirit, overflowing onto the paper and ink. Ouyang and his sons possessed a style of daring, vigorous, and strikingly beautiful lines, like an eagle soaring through the sky, a truly compelling display of youthful brilliance.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a> Li Taibai’s writing was fresh, vibrant, and full of life, its breath pure and graceful, escaping the mundane world and imbued with the essence of immortals.  Po Lao’s brushwork was unrestrained and full of vigor, brimming with natural innocence and charm.  Mi Chi’s dragon leaped through the Heavenly Gate, and the tiger lay upon the Phoenix’s throne. The writing of the Second Official astonished the world for a time, embodying a spirit of heroic grandeur. Huangshan Valley was serene and elegant, utterly secluded and unparalleled, its transcendence representing profound aspirations, a noble and exquisite atmosphere.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a> Every character is like its author, naturally manifesting itself. Only the writings of the Righteous Army are pure and refined, possessing a clear and vigorous spirit that disregards all others, thus establishing them as the revered foundation of character study for all ages. Master Lu was naturally gifted, possessing profound depth and breadth, making him the foremost scholar of the Tang Dynasty. Every stroke of a character is executed with a vertical rise, with the points firmly established and then rounded on all sides; the brush possesses a guiding force, avoiding irregularities and jaggedness, allowing for a unified and vigorous expression of spirit and bone.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a> Dong Wenmin said: If a person possesses great strength throughout his body, he can readily rise after falling. Furthermore, it is said: one gathers oneself, arrives oneself, and rises and ties oneself up – all this expresses the same meaning. Chu Henan’s cursive script and Zhao Wenmin’s regular script are fine to examine, and one can thereby gain understanding.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a> To write characters, one must first learn to hold a brush. *Ming Ge Han Xi Shou Zhi Shu Bai Yi Shu*, this book contains a diagram of brush formations, and the most correct method among them is the ‘拨镫’ and ‘平覆’ techniques. ‘拨镫’ is sometimes called ‘挑镫’ or ‘马镫’, but they share the same meaning. In short, when holding a brush, one must be familiar with the basics, and this will allow for easy movement. The method is to first expand the index finger, so that the tiger’s mouth becomes round, and the palm is empty. The index finger is used for strokes, the middle finger for pressure, the ring finger for hooks, the little finger for pushing and guiding, and all five fingers are pressed against the index finger. The method used for characters with strong and vigorous style.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a> To establish a firm grip, place the palm with the back of the hand covering the instrument, aligning the index finger and the second and third fingers slightly. Alternatively, the second and third fingers may be hooked together. Those using sharp, precise characters employ this method. Furthermore, there is the three-finger upright method, in which the index, second, and third fingers grasp the instrument, while the fourth and fifth fingers are not used. Finally, there is the four-finger upright method, in which the index finger is positioned within, and the second, third, and fourth fingers are positioned outward.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a> Or it is said that it is the method of the horse harness, like two people riding together, not attacking each other. These two methods are the most ingenious, because they do not require careful movement of the wrist, but rather the finger can move on its own. The method of taking notes is light and casual when writing on paper, and those who write with a relaxed style use it. The method of hanging the wrist then directs the movement of the wrist away from the table, enabling the entire force of the body to be focused on the tip of the brush.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a> Returning to the method, the palm faces inward, the five fingers are level, the wrist is upright and sharp, the brushstrokes are enveloped. These two methods measure the distance to the writing desk. That is to say, when striking the zither, flattening the cover, picking up the brush, or standing the brush upright, all are measured by the distance to the writing desk. The pillow-wrist method, occasionally employed, is also permissible.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a> Other styles such as the grappling-hand and clenched-fist methods, when employing broad strokes for inscriptions, cannot be denied. This is a matter of principle. The use of the fingers is not as effective as the use of the wrist; consequently, the bookmen developed the theory that the fingers must inevitably die. It is understood that the wrist should be flexible, but how can the fingers be allowed to become lifeless? The arm and fingers are closely connected; if one is moved, the whole body can move, let alone the arm and fingers. This is easily understood. If the wrist is used while the fingers remain unrelated, then the movement of the wrist will inevitably stagnate, and it will certainly become numb and insensitive; the saying that the wrist is alive and the fingers dead cannot be justified.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a> But when the wrist is flexible, its movement is specified, not leaving any trace, the movement of the finger follows the wrist, the movement of the wrist follows the finger; there are those who do not know the power that causes the wrist and the wrist to move; after a long time, the blood vessels in the elbow are concentrated, and the wrist also follows accordingly. When the spirit permeates the whole body, then the movement of the elbow also ceases to be aware of itself. This natural vital energy cannot be artificially molded or contrived. Therefore, the brush should be used lightly, the force should be light, the finger should be dense and straight; or it should be formed in a circular shape, then the tiger’s mouth will naturally round, and the palm will naturally be empty.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a> Then one must first sit upright with a calm mind, whereupon the vital energy will harmonize, the blood vessels will flow smoothly, the arms will become active, the wrists will become responsive, the fingers will become firm, and the brush will remain steady. This arm, this wrist, this palm, this lifting, this brush—all are employed in a single mind, unaware of their controller, yet each one performs its duty perfectly. When skill is fully mastered, the cleverness vanishes, and the methods of holding and wielding the brush are forgotten. This is what is meant by “the mind forgets, and the hand forgets the brush.”<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a> He said that when one was first learning, the focus was on the brush, not that the brush itself should be held tightly. Formerly, someone asked So Jing about his brush technique, and So Jing, holding the brush with three fingers, repeatedly said “Courage, courage, courage.” Ouyang Wencong said: There is no fixed method for holding a brush; one should make it loose and wide. Mi Xiangyang said: Learning calligraphy is valued for its ability to evoke the spirit; it should be quick and natural, arising unexpectedly.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a> Yellow River Master’s discourse on writing states: One must channel all bodily energy to the tip of the brush, acting with complete mastery. Old Poet’s saying is: Writing does not depend on the firmness of the hand, but on listening to the movement of the brush, without losing proper form. The words of Mr. Shu are all correct; he becomes obsessed with rigid adherence, thereby losing insight into the profound. The Doctrine of the Mean says: The truly sincere person does not strain, yet achieves harmony, and gains understanding without effort, moving with composure in the middle way.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a> To be sincere is to choose the best course and remain steadfast. This is the way, perfectly realized in skill! Those who study the classics should advance by diligent effort, gradually approaching nature. Skill progresses through the way. The ancients’ writing was dense and abundant in form and scope. The Han man Yan, the Song man Mi – their minds were overflowing, revealing the heart and eyes.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a> Upon reflecting on my father’s departure, the composition underwent a complete transformation; the narrow passages became open, the wide spaces constricted, the natural beauty was refined, and I appeared as if soaring from a cliff, cleansed and self-sufficient. However, the length of the piece was limited, departing from the style of ancient scholars.<br/>
<br/>
Writing can nourish and sustain one’s spirit, and it can also invigorate it. Through quiet sitting and the practice of writing楷法, even a few dozen or several hundred characters brought a sense of restlessness to a standstill. If writing in running script, one could freely pour out one’s feelings until a state of exhilaration and clarity was achieved.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a> Writing poetry, writing prose, has from the outset a clear principle; one perceives the flow of its development. Therefore, understanding the way of learning is sufficient to expand and broaden one’s talents and abilities, and to mature one’s scholarship.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></div>

注言：为道所规画。释名：道出其右曰画邱，人尚右，凡有指画，皆尚右。故用右手画字。或篆，或隶，或楷，或行，或草，皆当不忘画字之义；为横、为竖、为波、为磔、为钩、为，当永守画字之法。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br/>

此不过前人等而上之，精益求精之语，非谓不能写字，而竟同剔刷成字，描画成字也。自桧以下无讥。后之作书者欲求苏、米之刷字、画字，不可得矣。　　　　书法在用笔，用笔贵用锋。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br/>
用锋之说吾闻之矣，或曰正锋，或曰中锋，或曰藏锋，或曰出锋，或曰侧锋，或曰扁锋。知书者有得于心，言之了了，知而不知者各执一见，亦复言之津津，究竟聚讼纷纭，指归莫定，所以然者，因前人指示后学要言不烦，未尝倾筐倒箧而出之。后人摹仿前贤，一知半解，未能穷追极究而思之也。余尝辨之，试详言之：所谓中锋者，自然要先正其笔。<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br/>
柳公权曰：心正则笔正，笔正则锋易于正。中锋即是正锋，自不必说。而余则偏有说焉，笔管以竹为之，本是直而不曲，其性刚，欲使之正，则竟正。笔头以毫为之，本是易起易倒，其性柔，欲使之正，却难保其不偃。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br/>
倘无法以驱策之，则笔管坚而笔头已卧，可谓之中锋乎？又或极力把持，收其锋于笔尖之内，贴毫根于纸素之上，如以箸头画字一般，是笔则正矣、中矣，然锋已无矣，尚得谓之锋乎？或曰：此藏锋法也。试问所谓藏锋者，藏锋于笔头之内乎？抑藏锋于字画之内乎？必有爽然失、恍然悟者。第藏锋画内之说，人亦知之。知之而谓惟藏锋乃是中锋，中锋无不藏锋，则又有未尽然也。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br/>
盖藏锋、中锋之法，如匠人钻物，然下手之始四面展动，乃可入木三分。既定之后，则钻已深入，然后持之以正。字法亦然。能中锋自能藏锋，如锥画沙，如印印泥，正谓此也，然笔锋所到收处、结处、掣笔映带处，亦正有出锋者。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br/>
字锋出，笔锋亦出。笔锋虽出，而仍是笔尖之锋，则藏锋、出锋皆谓之中锋，不得专以藏锋为中锋也。至侧锋之法，则以侧势取其利导，古人间亦有之。若俗笔笔正锋，则有意于正势，必至无锋而后止。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br/>
欲笔笔侧笔，则有意于侧势，必至扁锋而后止。琴瑟专一，谁能听之？其理一也。画家皴石之法，三面皆锋，须以侧锋为之。笔锋出，则石锋乃出。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br/>
若竟横卧其笔，则一片模糊，不成其为石矣。总之，作字之法，先使腕灵笔活，凌空取势，沉着痛快，淋漓酣畅，纯任自然，不可思议，能将此笔正用、侧用、顺用、重用、轻用、虚用、实用、擒得定，纵得出，遒得紧，拓得开，浑身都是解数，全仗笔尖毫末锋芒指使，乃为合拍。钝根人胶柱鼓瑟，刻舟求剑，以团笔为中锋，以扁笔为侧锋，犹斤斤曰：若者中锋，若者偏锋，若者是，若者不是。纯是梦呓！故知此事虽藉人功，亦关天分，道中、道外，自有定数，一艺之细，尚索解人而不得。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br/>
噫，难矣！　　用墨之法，浓欲其活，淡欲其华。活与华非墨宽不可，古砚微凹聚墨多，可想见古人意也。濡染大笔何淋漓，淋漓二字，正有讲究。濡染亦自有法。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br/>
作书时须通开其笔，点入砚池，如篙之点水，使墨从笔尖入，则笔酣而墨饱，挥洒之下，使墨从笔尖出，则墨浥而笔凝。杜诗云：元气淋漓障犹湿。古人字画流传久远之后，如初脱手光景，精气神采不可磨灭。不善用墨者浓则易枯，淡则近薄，不数年间已淹淹无生气矣。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br/>

画曰：若升高必自下。言不容躐等也。今之讲字学者，初学执笔，便高谈晋、唐，满口羲、献；稍得形模，即欲追踪汉、魏，不但苏、黄、米、蔡不在意中，即欧、虞、褚、薛以上，溯羲、献犹以为不足，真可谓探本穷源，识高于顶者矣！及至写出字来，亦只平平无奇。噫，何弗思之甚也！余亦曾犯此病，初学时取欧书以定间架，久之字成印板，因爱褚书跌宕，乃学褚书；久之又患过于流走，此皆自己习气与欧、褚无干，如是者亦有年。<a id="orig-24p" href="#trans-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br/>
嗣后东涂西抹，率意酬应，喜作行草，乃取怀仁所集圣教及兴福寺断碑、孙过庭书谱学之，对帖时少，挥洒时多，总觉依稀仿佛无有是处。乃阅近世石刻墨迹，颇有入处；再阅同时书家真迹，反觉易于揣摩，而尤难于学步，乃叹自己学问不但远不及古人，且远不及今人。于是将今人笔墨逐一研究，时而进观董、赵诸公书，更长一见识焉。又进而观宋人碑帖，又得其解数焉。<a id="orig-25p" href="#trans-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br/>
又进而摹欧、虞、褚、薛、颜、柳、徐、李诸家书，已略得其蹊径焉，再上而求右军、大令诸法；已稍能寻其端倪焉。至此，乃恍然于前此之取法乎上者，真躐等而进也。近又见得颜鲁公书最好，以其天趣横生、脚踏实地、继往开来，惟此为最。昔人云：诗至子美，书至鲁公，足叹观止。<a id="orig-26p" href="#trans-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br/>
此言不余欺也！余书无所得，惟屡疑屡悟，或出或入，不敢谓三折肱于此，而于书中甘苦尝之久矣，因书之以为知书者告。　　　　字学以用敬为第一义，凡遇笔砚辄起矜庄，则精神自然振作，落笔便有主宰，何患书道不成！泛泛涂抹，无有是处。　　　　作字须提得笔起，稍知书法者皆知之。然往往手欲提而转折顿挫辄自偃者，无擒纵故也。<a id="orig-27p" href="#trans-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br/>
擒纵二字是书家要诀，有擒纵方有节制，有生杀用笔乃醒，醒则骨节通灵，自无僵卧纸上之病。否则寻行数墨，暗中索摸，虽略得其波磔往来之迹，不过优孟衣冠，登场傀儡，何足语斯道耶？　　　　余自幼观唐、宋诸名家石刻，以为唐书如玉，宋书如水晶，心目中所见如此，未尝申明其所以然也。后读朱子语类云：孔子之学如玉，孟子之学如水晶，乃拍案惊喜，以为比拟切当。见得天地间人也、物也、学问也、技艺也，皆各分浑与露之两途，而心目中所见，古今人不甚相远也。<a id="orig-28p" href="#trans-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br/>
　　　　初学不外临摹。临书得其笔意，摹书得其间架。临摹既久，则莫如多看、多悟、多商量、多变通。坡翁学书，尝将古人字帖悬诸壁间，观其举止动静，心摹手追，得其大意。<a id="orig-29p" href="#trans-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br/>
此中有人、有我，所谓：学不纯，师也。又尝有句云：诗不求工字不奇，天真烂漫是吾师。古人用心不同，故能出人头地。余尝谓：临摹不过学字中之字，多会悟则字中有字、字外有字，全从虚处著精神。<a id="orig-30p" href="#trans-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br/>
彼钞帖、画帖者，何曾梦见？　　　　废纸败笔，随意挥洒，往往得心应手。一遇精纸佳笔，整襟危坐，公然作书，反不免思遏手蒙。所以然者，一则破空横行，孤行己意，不期工而自工也；一则刻意求工，局于成见，不期拙而自拙也。又若高会酬酢，对客挥毫，与闲窗自怡，兴到笔随，其乖合亦复迥别。<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br/>
欲除此弊，固在平时用功多写，或于临时酬应多尽数纸，则腕愈熟、神愈闲，心空笔脱，指与物化矣。总之，凡事有人则天不全，不可不知。　　　　徐而庵先生说唐诗，阐发尽致，开卷有论诗数条，内一条云：学诗如僧家托钵，积千家米煮成一锅饭。余谓学书亦然，执笔之法，始先择笔之相近者仿之，逮步伐点画稍有合处，即宜纵览诸家法帖，辨其同异，审其出入，融会而贯通之，酝酿之久，自成一家面目。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br/>
否则刻舟求剑，依样葫芦，米海岳所谓奴书是也。古人作书，遗貌取神。今人作书，貌合神离。其间相去之远，岂可以道里计哉？　　　　名家作书，只是一鼻孔出气。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br/>
赵集贤云：书法随时变迁，用笔千古不易，古人得佳帖数行，专心学之，便能名家。据此似与余前说博观之义相戾，殊不知由一贯万，由万会一，总是一个道理。所谓千古不易者，要在善于弄翰磬控纵，送锋芒不顿，如庖丁解牛，批却导窾，迎刃而解；即所谓其中非尔力也。不明此旨，无论博搜约取，茫无把鼻。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br/>
谚云：见一个菩萨磕一个头，不免终身为门外汉耳。　　　　凡学艺，于古人论说总须细心体会，粗心浮气，无有是处。尝见某帖跋尾有驳赵文敏笔法不易之说者，谓欧、虞、薛、褚笔法已是不同，试以褚书笔法为欧书结构，断难相合，安得谓千古不易乎？余窃笑其翻案之谬。盖赵文敏为有元一代大家，岂有道外之语！所谓千古不易者，指笔之肌理言之，非指笔之面目言之也。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br/>
谓笔锋落纸，势如破竹，分肌劈理，因势利导，要在落笔之先腾掷而起，飞行绝迹，不粘定纸上讲求生活，笔所未到，气已吞。笔所已到，气亦不尽，故能墨无旁沈，肥不剩肉，瘦不露骨，魄力、气韵、风神皆于此出。书法要旨，不外是矣。集贤所说只是浑而举之，古人于此等处不落言诠。<a id="orig-36p" href="#trans-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br/>
余曾得斯旨，不惮反复言之，亦仅能形容及此，会心人定当首肯。若以形迹求之，何异痴人说梦！　　　　作字有顺逆，有向背，有起伏，有轻重，有聚散，有刚柔，有燥湿，有疾徐，有疏密，有肥瘦，有浓淡，有连有断，有脱御，有承接，具此数者，方能成书。否则，墨猪、算子，全是魔道矣。　　　　古人作书，落笔一圆便圆到底，落笔一方便方到底，各成一种章法。<a id="orig-37p" href="#trans-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br/>
兰亭用圆，圣教用方，二帖为百代书法模楷，所谓规矩方圆之至也！欧颜大、小字皆方；虞书则大、小皆圆；褚书则大字用方，小字用圆。究竟方圆，仍是并用。以结构言之，则体方而用圆；以转束言之，则内方而外圆；以笔质言之，则骨方而肉圆。此是一定之理。<a id="orig-38p" href="#trans-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br/>
又晋人体势多扁，唐人体势多长，合晋、唐观之，惟右军、鲁公无长扁之偏，而为方圆之极则。　　　　晋人取韵，唐人取法，宋人取意，人皆知之。吾谓晋书如仙，唐书如圣，宋书如豪杰。学书者从此分门别户，落笔时方有宗旨。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br/>
　　　　字有筋骨、血脉、皮肉、神韵、脂泽、气息，数者缺一不可。无论真楷行草，皆宜讲究。楷书须八面俱到，古人称卫夫人、逸少父子、欧阳率更、虞永兴、智永禅师、颜鲁公此七家谓之楷书，其余不过真书而已。楷书者字体端正，用笔合法之谓也。<a id="orig-40p" href="#trans-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br/>
行楷者，字虽绾结，笔仍典则之谓也。此外或真书，或行书，或真行，或行草，或大草，或墨色不到而意与笔皆到，或笔墨不到而意无不到，总之以法为主，气以辅之，则任笔所之，无不如志矣。　　　　欧、虞、褚、薛不拘拘于说文，犹之韩、柳、欧、苏不斤斤于音韵。空诸所有，精神乃出。<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br/>
古人作楷，正体、帖体纷见错出，随意布置。惟鲁公干禄字书一正一帖，剖析详明，此专为字画偏旁而设，而其用笔尽合楷则。近来书生笔墨、台阁文章，偏旁布置，穷工极巧，其实不过写正体字，非真楷书也。　　　　楷书如立，行书如走，草书如飞，此就字体言之，用笔亦然，执笔落纸如人之立地，脚根既定，伸腰舒背，骨立自然强健，稍一转动，四面皆应。<a id="orig-42p" href="#trans-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br/>
不善用笔者，非坐卧纸上，即蹲伏纸上矣。欲除此弊，无他谬巧，只如思翁所谓：落笔时先提得笔起耳。　　　　所谓落笔先提得笔起者，总不外凌空起步、意在笔先。一到著纸，便如兔起鹘落，令人不可思议。<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br/>
笔机到则笔势劲，笔锋出，随倒随起，自无僵卧之病矣！古人谓：心正则气定，气定则腕活，腕活则笔端，笔端则墨注，墨注则神凝，神凝则象滋，无意而皆意，不法而皆法。此正是先天一著工夫，省却多少言思拟议，所谓一了百了也。　　　　字无所谓山林、台阁也，古来书家类多置身廓庙之士，若终身隐沦者恐亦不少，而其书之传与不传，或传之远与近，虽各因名位为显晦，而诣之所至，不可磨灭。且有学问经术超越寻常，反为书名所掩者。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br/>
盖亦有数存乎其间也。自帖括之习成，字法遂别为一体。土龙木偶，毫无意趣，矫其弊者又复貌为高古，自出新奇。究之学台阁者，趣入官样；学山林者，流为野战。<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br/>
皆非书家正法眼藏也。　　　　字莫患乎散，尤莫病于结。散则贯注不下，结则摆脱不开。古人作书，于联络处见章法，于洒落处见意境。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br/>
右军书转左侧右，变化迷离，所谓状若断而复连，势如斜而反正者，妙于离合故也。欧、虞、褚、薛各得其秘，而欧书尤为显露，其要在从谨严得森挺，从密栗得疏朗，或行或楷，必左右揖让，倜傥权奇，戈戟铦锐，物象生动，自成一家风骨。史称其人貌丑而颖悟，观其书信然！学者得其一鳞片甲，由唐入晋，自有门径矣。　　　　字有九宫，分行布白是也。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br/>
右军黄庭经、乐毅论，欧阳率更醴泉铭、千字文，皆九宫之最准者，其要不外斗笋接缝，八面皆满，字内无短缺处，字外无长出处，总归平直中正，无他谬巧也。　　　　字有解数，大旨在逆，逆则紧，逆则劲，缩者伸之势，郁者畅之机，而又须因迟见速，寓巧于拙，取圆于方。狐疑不决，病在馁。剽急不留，病在滑。<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br/>
得笔须随，失笔须救，细参消息，斯为得之。　　　　用笔之法，太轻则浮，太重则踬。到恰好处，直当得意。唐人妙处正在不轻不重之间，重规叠矩，而仍以风神之笔出之。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br/>
褚河南谓：字里金生，行间玉润。又云：如锥画沙，如印印泥。虞永兴书如抽刀断水，颜鲁公古钗股、屋漏痕，皆是善使笔锋，熨帖不陂，故臻绝境。不善学者，非失之偏软，即失之生硬；非失之浅率，即失之重滞。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br/>
貌为古拙，反入于颓靡；托为强健，又流于倔强。未识用笔分寸，无怪去古人日远也。　　　　古人谓：喜气画兰，怒气画竹，各有所宜。余谓：笔墨之间，本足觇人气象，书法亦然。<a id="orig-51p" href="#trans-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br/>
王右军、虞世南字体馨逸，举止安和，蓬蓬然得春夏之气，即所谓喜气也。徐季海善用渴笔，世状其貌如怒猊抉石、渴骥奔泉，即所谓怒气也。褚登善、颜常山、柳谏议文章妙古今，忠义贯日月，其书严正之气溢于楮墨。欧阳父子险劲秀拔，鹰隼摩空，英俊之气咄咄逼人。<a id="orig-52p" href="#trans-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br/>
李太白书新鲜秀活，呼吸清淑，摆脱尘凡，飘飘乎有仙气。坡老笔挟风涛，天真烂漫；米痴龙跳天门，虎卧凤阙。二公书横绝一时，是一种豪杰之气。黄山谷清臒雅脱，古澹绝伦，超卓之中寄托深远，是名贵气象。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br/>
凡此皆字如其人，自然流露者。惟右军书，醇粹之中，清雄之气俛视一切，所以为千古字学之圣。鲁公浑厚天成，精深博大，所以为有唐一代之冠。　　　　凡字每落笔皆纵点起，点定则四面皆圆，笔有主宰，不致偏枯草率，波折钩勒，一气相生，风骨自然遒劲。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br/>
董文敏谓：如大力人通身是力，倒辄能起。又云：自收自到，自起自结。皆此意也。褚河南行书、赵文敏行楷，细参自能悟入。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br/>
　　　　作字先学执笔，明戈汉溪守智书法辨异一书，载有笔阵图，执笔诸式其最正中者，莫如拨镫、平覆两法。拨镫或谓挑镫，或谓马镫，于义皆是。总之执笔须浅，浅则易于转动，其法先拓大指，使虎口圆则掌心自虚，大指为捺，食指为压，中指为钩，无名指为抵推导送，五指则紧贴名指之内，相助为力。字之讲遒劲者用之。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br/>
平覆之法，使掌下覆，大指与二、三指稍齐，或用二、三指双钩。字之讲犀利者用之。此外有三指立异法，则以大、二、三指搦管，四、五指不用。四指立异法，则大指在内，二、三、四指在外。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br/>
或谓即马镫法，如两人并乘，各不相犯。此二法最妙，以其不必留心运腕，而指自能不动也。撮笔法，著纸轻浅，字之尚逸趣者用之。悬腕法，则运腕离案，能使通身气力贯注笔尖。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br/>
回腕法，掌心向内，五指俱平，腕竖锋正，笔画兜裹。此二法，量字体大小为离案之远近。即拨镫、平覆、撮笔、立异法，亦无不离案也。枕腕法，间或为之，亦无不可。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br/>
其他如抓斗式、握拳式，擘窠大书用作榜署者，不能不尔，无所为法则也。运指不如运腕，书家遂有腕活指死之说。不知腕固宜活，指安得死！肘使腕，腕使指，血脉本是流通，牵一发而全身尚能皆动，何况臂指之近乎？此理易明。若使运腕而指竟漠不相关，则腕之运也，必滞其书，亦必至麻木不仁，所谓腕活指死者，不可以辞害意。<a id="orig-60p" href="#trans-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br/>
不过腕灵则指定，其运动处不著形迹，运指腕随，运腕指随，有不知指之使腕与腕之使指者，久之，肘中血脉贯注，而腕亦随之定矣。周身精神贯注，则运肘亦不自知矣。此自然之气机，非可以矫揉造作也。所以把笔宜浅，用力宜轻，指宜密、宜直；或作环抱状，则虎口自圆，掌心自虚。<a id="orig-61p" href="#trans-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br/>
又先须端坐正心，则气自和，血脉自贯，臂自活，腕自灵，指自凝，笔自端。是臂也、腕也、掌也、提也、笔也，皆运用在一心，不知所使，而无不一一效命者也。至于熟极巧生，直便化去，并执笔、运笔之法，亦皆忘之，所谓心忘手，手忘笔也。王献之少时学书，右军从背后取其笔而不可，知其长大必能名世。<a id="orig-62p" href="#trans-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br/>
盖谓初学时着意在笔，非谓用笔宜紧也。又昔有人问索靖笔法，索靖以三指执笔，闭目谓之曰：胆、胆、胆。欧阳文忠公谓：执笔无定法，要使虚而宽。米襄阳谓：学书贵弄翰，迅速天真，出于意外。<a id="orig-63p" href="#trans-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br/>
黄涪翁论书谓：须通身气力来笔尾上，直当得意。坡老云：作书不在笔牢，浩然听笔之所之，而不失法度。数公之言皆是，由执几化，绝妙悟境。中庸云：诚者不勉而中，不思而得，从容中道。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br/>
诚之者，择善而固执之。道也通乎艺矣！学书者由勉强以渐近自然，艺也进于道矣。古人书，行间茂密，体势宽博。唐之颜，宋之米，其精力弥满，令人洞心駴目。<a id="orig-65p" href="#trans-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br/>
自思翁出，而章法一变，密处皆疏，宽处皆紧，天然秀削，有振衣千仞、洁身自好光景，然篇幅较狭，去古人远矣。　　　　作书能养气，亦能助气。静坐作楷法数十字或数百字，便觉矜躁俱平。若行草，任意挥洒，至痛快淋漓之候，又觉灵心焕发。<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br/>
下笔作诗、作文，自有头头是道，汨汨其来之势。故知书道，亦足以恢扩才情、酝酿学问也。　　　　<a id="orig-67p" href="#trans-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></div>

It then confines and corrects the boundaries of propriety, examining the intentions of ancient sages and worthies, and those pursuing the Way may only grasp a small portion of it. It is then abandoned to focus on the learning of characters and paintings, discarding its purpose while pursuing the arrangement of symbols, and yet it remains at the end.

It was only then that one realized it. The ancients’ intention in writing was often beyond the mere strokes and ink; those who sought its meaning could not escape being bound by the strokes and ink, and yet still could not transcend them.

Once it is established, the drill has already penetrated deeply, then one holds it steadily in a straight line. The same applies to characters. Those that accurately capture the central edge can also conceal the sharp edge; like a needle drawing sand, like an inkstone and ink, this is precisely what it is.

When one is truly awake, the bones become enlightened, and there is no longer the illness of being stiff and immobile on paper. Otherwise, searching and probing with a few strokes of ink, attempting to discern the subtle traces of their movements, is merely a clever imitation of clothing and appearance—a puppet on display; how can this be considered the way?<br/>

I, from a young age, observed the stone carvings of renowned figures from the Tang and Song dynasties, regarding the Tang script as like jade and the Song script like crystal. I held this belief without ever explicitly stating its reason. Later, reading Zhu Zi’s *Yilu* (Commentary on the Writings of Confucius), I was astonished when I read that Confucius’s learning was like jade and Mencius’s learning was like crystal; I considered it a perfect analogy. Observing people, objects, learning, and skills in the world, I found that they were all distinct yet flowed from two separate paths, and my perception of them was not greatly different from that of ancient and modern scholars.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></div>

Mr. Xu Er’an explained Tang poetry, elucidating it to its fullest extent, commenting on numerous passages upon opening a book, one of which states: “Learning poetry is like a monk wandering without shelter, accumulating the rice of a thousand households to cook a single pot of rice.” I believe learning writing is similarly so.

Their essence lies in the precise joining of the segments, with all eight sides fully filled, without any deficiencies within the characters, or protrusions outside them; they always return to a straight and upright center, without any superfluous ornamentation.<br/>
<br/>
The characters possess numerical interpretations, and their primary purpose is to reflect reversals. Reversals are tight and forceful, embodying the contraction and expansion of a coiled spring. Those that are constricted must be released, and those that are stagnant must be opened. Yet, one must also incorporate deliberate slowness with swiftness, and cunning within simplicity, and roundness within squareness. Doubtful and unresolved, the illness lies in starvation. Hasty and impetuous, without restraint, the illness lies in slipping.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">To write characters, one must first learn to hold a brush. *Ming Ge Han Xi Shou Zhi Shu Bai Yi Shu*, this book contains a diagram of brush formations, and the most correct method among them is the ‘拨镫’ and ‘平覆’ techniques. ‘拨镫’ is sometimes called ‘挑镫’ or ‘马镫’, but they share the same meaning. In short, when holding a brush, one must be familiar with the basics, and this will allow for easy movement. The method is to first expand the index finger, so that the tiger’s mouth becomes round, and the palm is empty. The index finger is used for strokes, the middle finger for pressure, the ring finger for hooks, the little finger for pushing and guiding, and all five fingers are pressed against the index finger.

Furthermore, there is the three-finger upright method, in which the index, second, and third fingers grasp the instrument, while the fourth and fifth fingers are not used. Finally, there is the four-finger upright method, in which the index finger is positioned within, and the second, third, and fourth fingers are positioned outward.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></div>

The method of taking notes is light and casual when writing on paper, and those who write with a relaxed style use it. The method of hanging the wrist then directs the movement of the wrist away from the table, enabling the entire force of the body to be focused on the tip of the brush.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Other styles such as the grappling-hand and clenched-fist methods, when employing broad strokes for inscriptions, cannot be denied. This is a matter of principle. The use of the fingers is not as effective as the use of the wrist; consequently, the bookmen developed the theory that the fingers must inevitably die. It is understood that the wrist should be flexible, but how can the fingers be allowed to become lifeless? The arm and fingers are closely connected; if one is moved, the whole body can move, let alone the arm and fingers. This is easily understood. If the wrist is used while the fingers remain unrelated, then the movement of the wrist will inevitably stagnate, and it will certainly become numb and insensitive; the saying that the wrist is alive and the fingers dead cannot be justified.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content">But when the wrist is flexible, its movement is specified, not leaving any trace, the movement of the finger follows the wrist, the movement of the wrist follows the finger; there are those who do not know the power that causes the wrist and the wrist to move; after a long time, the blood vessels in the elbow are concentrated, and the wrist also follows accordingly. When the spirit permeates the whole body, then the movement of the elbow also ceases to be aware of itself. This natural vital energy cannot be artificially molded or contrived. Therefore, the brush should be used lightly, the force should be light, the finger should be dense and straight; or it should be formed in a circular shape, then the tiger’s mouth will naturally round, and the palm will naturally be empty.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></div>
