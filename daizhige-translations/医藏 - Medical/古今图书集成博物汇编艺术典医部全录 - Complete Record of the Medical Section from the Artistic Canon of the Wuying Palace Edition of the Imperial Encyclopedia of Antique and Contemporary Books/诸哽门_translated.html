<p>The Various Throat Disorders</p>
<p>Qianjin Formulae by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)&quot;<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Major Medical Practices</strong></p>
<p>For those who treat illnesses, they must treat according to the type of ailment. Is it appropriate to use a cormorant to handle a fish bone obstruction, or a tiger to deal with a bone blockage? However, matters like bamboo strips, garlic, chewing tendons, and honey can be universally applied.</p>
<p><strong>From Type Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze states: All treatment methods follow the type. For instance, cormorants and otters treat fish bones, magnets treat needles, ash treats hair, and tigers address various bone issues, all corresponding to their kinds.</p>
<p><strong>The Most Excellent Method of Inducing Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For objects lodged in the throat, it generally results from food entering and not going down, causing obstruction. If one pushes by reasoning, inducing it to come upwards is the proper way. Therefore, the practitioner should induce vomiting, taking advantage of the upward motion of food. This is straightforward and akin to removing a thorn. If the obstruction is deep, one must push it down; otherwise, the principle and force cannot be delayed, and over time, the throat obstruction may swell further, with food in the belly consumed. Although one may want to induce vomiting, there will be nothing to push if the obstruction worsens, leading to an inability to eat. Following this pattern may ultimately lead to dire consequences.</p>
<p>In treating obstructions, one should not hastily provide rice soup or rice, fearing that rice grains may enter the wound. It is better to consume soups for several days. The subsequent formula mentioned, which can treat all kinds of objects and bone obstructions, even threads tangled in the throat. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: If illness arises externally without being due to internal energy movement, it is foolish to believe one can treat it using hidden scripture spells.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Methods for Removing Choking Obstructions</strong></p>
<p>To remove a choking obstruction, take deer sinew, soak it until soft, and form it into a ball the size of a marble. Tie it with thread, hold one end of the sinew, and swallow it down the throat. Push it to the obstruction, then gradually pull it out to remove the blockage.</p>
<p>Another method: create a smooth bamboo strip, wrap it with cotton, and insert it into the throat at the obstruction. It can be pushed or pulled, and the obstruction will come out.</p>
<p>Another method: take two taels of cotton, heat it with honey until hot, and use it to press gently over the obstruction from the outside. If it does not come out, boil another piece of cotton to replace the used one, and also blow a little soap pod powder into the nose to induce sneezing, which will help expel the obstruction.</p>
<p>Another method: boil garlic bulbs until half-cooked, chew them slightly, tie a string around the center of the garlic, swallow it while holding the string, and when it reaches the obstruction, pull the string to remove the blockage.</p>
<p>Another method: take powdered tiger bone or raccoon bone, and consume a piece the size of a thumb.</p>
<p>Another method: take powdered chuan mu, and consume a piece the size of a thumb.</p>
<p>For fish bone obstruction: use cormorant droppings and consume a piece the size of a thumb.</p>
<p>Another method: chant &quot;cormorant&quot; seven times, then swallow with water.</p>
<p>Another method: take tangerine peel soup.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Another method: Take sugar water.</p>
<p>Another method: Burn fishnet ash and swallow a small piece. It must be effective; use the fishnet to replace the head and stand it down. If a bone gets stuck in the throat and cannot be removed by anyone, take candy pills the size of a chicken egg yolk and swallow them. If they don&#39;t go down, keep swallowing, gradually making them larger until you reach ten pills.</p>
<p>Another method: Swallow the dung of tigers or wolves.</p>
<p>Another method: Swallow pig fat the size of a chicken egg; if it does not heal, swallow more until healed.</p>
<p>If hair gets stuck in the throat during eating and cannot be swallowed: take tangled hair, burn it to ashes, and take it with one qian of liquor.</p>
<p>If money is mistakenly swallowed: Take five liang of mugwort, boil it with five sheng of water to extract one sheng, and drink it down immediately.</p>
<p>Another method: Take charcoal powder and swallow it with a small amount of liquor; water can also be used.</p>
<p>If gold or silver rings and hairpins are swallowed: Take two jin of white sugar and gradually eat it in one go; eating more is also good. </p>
<p>Another method: Swallow one liang of mercury and take it again.</p>
<p>For mistakenly swallowing rings and finger cots: Burn seven geese feathers to ash; goose feathers can also be used.</p>
<p>If a hairpin is mistakenly swallowed: Wither leeks by exposure, steam them without cutting, and eat a bunch to expel it. Fresh wheat leaf fibers can also be used in the same way, but if they are weak, eating more will help to dispel it.</p>
<p>If copper or iron is swallowed and causes choking: Burn the teeth of a crossbow until red and drink it in wine; it will heal immediately.</p>
<p>If nails, needles, or arrowheads are swallowed: Just eat a lot of fatty meat until full, and it will wrap itself out.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Accidental Ingestion of a Needle</strong>: Take powdered magnet and dissolve it with a small spoon of water, then swallow it. According to &quot;Records of Ancient and Modern Evidence,&quot; if a needle is lodged in the throat, taking powdered magnet will cause it to go into the stomach. If you hold the magnet in your mouth, you may be able to suck the needle out.</p>
<p><strong>For Fish Bones Stuck for a Long Time</strong>: Introduce a small amount of soapberry powder into the nose to induce sneezing, which could help expel the bone. This remedy is often kept secret.</p>
<p><strong>For Stuck Fish Bones</strong>: Take otter claw from underneath the chin and scrape it, or cook it and eat the juice.</p>
<p><strong>To Cure a Stuck Bone</strong>: Swallow one gallbladder of a mole cricket; this can also help extract fish spines. Apply this remedy directly to the spine.</p>
<p><strong>For a Fish Bone Lodged in the Throat for Six to Seven Days</strong>: Take scales from a carp and burn them into powder; drink them with water to expel the bone. If it doesn&#39;t come out after the first dose, take another.</p>
<p><strong>For Bones That Won&#39;t Come Out</strong>: Grind sand ginger and licorice into powder, wrap it in cotton, and slowly swallow while producing saliva until it eventually comes out with phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>For Stuck Fish Bones</strong>: Chew chives until soft, tie them with a fine string in the mouth, and swallow down to where the bone is lodged; pulling it will help to expel the bone. </p>
<p><strong>Another Remedy</strong>: Take a cup of water, silently write the character for &quot;dragon&quot; with your left eye in the water, and then drink it. It should work within two cups. If a child has a bone stuck, an adult should use the same method as described above.</p>
<p><strong>Yet Another Method</strong>: Use the single root of a red chestnut with the tip facing down, mash it with the root of the flower &quot;Jade Hairpin,&quot; and pour the natural juice into the throat using a bamboo tube. Do not touch the teeth; if you do, they might dissolve. The chestnut fruit refers to hawthorn.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Chicken Bone Obstruction:</strong> Use chicken broth to dissolve the obstruction or swallow a large piece of syrup or candy whole.<br><strong>Another Recipe:</strong> Burn badger bones to ash and mix with a small amount of medicine. 【Chen&#39;s Method】  </p>
<p><strong>Fish Bone Obstruction:</strong> Chew golden phoenix flower until it is mushy and then hold it in the mouth. If there are no seeds, use the root to mash, squeeze for juice and swallow.<br><strong>Another Recipe:</strong> Press a fish bone against the forehead and cough until it comes out.<br><strong>Another Recipe:</strong> Use the fish bone to repeatedly throw against the back with both hands until it comes out.<br><strong>Another Recipe:</strong> Mash the root of daylily for juice and swallow to expel it.<br><strong>Another Recipe:</strong> Grind rose root to powder, mix with water to take with a small spoon.  </p>
<p><strong>General Bone Obstruction:</strong> Mash wild ramie root into a paste, about the size of longan flesh, and swallow it. If obstructed by chicken bone, dissolve it with chicken soup. For fish bone obstruction, dissolve it with fish soup.<br><strong>Another Recipe:</strong> Crush the seeds of paper mulberry to extract juice and take.  </p>
<p><strong>Fish Bone Obstruction:</strong> Use olives, which have a bitter taste but become sweet when chewed for a long time; chew and swallow the juice. 【From &quot;Yan Yi&quot;】<br><strong>Bone Obstruction:</strong> Use deer antlers powdered finely, hold in mouth and swallow with saliva. 【From &quot;Doumen Formula&quot;】<br><strong>Throat Obstruction:</strong> Burn old wooden comb to ash and mix with wine to drink.  </p>
<p><strong>Stomach Pain from Fish Bones:</strong> Boil a cup of Wuzhuyu (dried fruit) tea and drink; it will soften and break the bones; or use good rice vinegar in half a cup, which also softens and stops the pain. 【From Danxi】<br><strong>Accidental Ingestion of Wheat Awns Stuck in Throat:</strong> Upside down a goose, let saliva flow into a bowl, drink a little, and it will go down along with the saliva.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>When a splinter from bamboo pierces the throat: use a stick from a bamboo fence aged several years, boil it in running water to make a broth and drink it.</p>
<p>When accidentally swallowing a coin: use fresh water chestnut, grind to extract juice, and sip it.</p>
<p>For accidentally swallowing coins and silver or gold objects: take one tael of white powder and a little bit of saltpeter to consume, making two doses. If gold or silver is swallowed in the abdomen, this will dissolve it.</p>
<p>For choking on money: take a handful of mugwort, boil in five liters of water, and take one liter of the decoction all at once to expel it. Another method: use four taels of the root of hundred parts, soak in a liter of wine overnight, and warm it to drink one liter.</p>
<p>For choking on fish bones, bamboo, wood, or other items: use ivory powder mixed with water, take one qian (a weight unit).</p>
<p>Another method: recite the incantation from Taoist texts: &quot;I summon the Supreme Being to flow eastward with the current, the Supreme Being obeys the decree to capture the poison of water; I ask the Great Emperor to manifest, may all appear, urgently as the law commands, I command! Focus on the essence and repeat seven times.&quot; Then with the left hand, bend the middle and ring fingers to form the Three Mountains seal, place a bowl of pure water above, with the right hand pinching the characters for the Golden Spear seal. The left hand is below, the right hand is above, the left represents the earth, the right represents the heavens, and with an airy motion, perform this nine times to establish it. With the left foot horizontal and the right foot vertical, form a T-shape, perform the enlightenment process like looking towards the sun and moon, take a deep breath and blow it into the vessel. This method has no prohibitions; when using it, focus on the correct vital energy.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Another divine method for incantation: To treat a bone stuck in the throat where there is no medicine available, take a cup of fresh water and chant: &quot;As I flow eastward, can there be toxic deeds? Quickly, quickly, as per the law!&quot; Focus and recite it seven times, gathering the light of the sun and moon, then blow this energy into the water. The afflicted person should take three large sips of the water, and soon it will go down.</p>
<p>Method of the Nine Dragons Entering the Cave: With the left hand, form the Three Mountains hand gesture, holding a clean cup of water facing east. With the right hand, form the sword gesture, and write the words &quot;Cloud Dragon Ghost&quot; in the water. Recite the incantation: &quot;This cup transforms into the great ocean of the east, the throat transforms into a deep abyss a thousand fathoms deep. By the method of Nine Dragons entering the cave, I command under the authority of the Supreme Laozi, quickly, as per the law! Swallow this medicinal water, and the obstruction will dissolve.&quot; Nowadays, people often use a nine-segment bamboo stick of about a foot long, placing it in their mouth to swallow according to the method, as if there were nothing.</p>
<p>To relieve a bone stuck in the throat: Use equal parts of powdered loess and licorice. Use the right hand to prepare the powder, wrap a small amount in cotton, and hold it in the mouth while continuously swallowing saliva. After a while, it will come out.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Medical Cases</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;The Confucian Door to Filiality&quot;: A small child accidentally swallowed a coin, which became lodged in the throat, and all the doctors were unable to remove it or allow it to go down. Then they ordered a person to help. This person thought carefully and suddenly devised a plan: take clean white paper, roll it into a shape like a chopstick, and cut the ends in a crosswise manner to create a frayed appearance. Then, separately take a chopstick and tie a hook to its end, ensuring it cannot come off. First, swallow it down lightly while gently pulling and pushing to feel for the hook in the coin’s opening. Then use the paper roll to swallow it, allowing the hook&#39;s tip to touch the end of the paper roll without harming the flesh, and pull it out.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Medical Sayings&quot;: A child accidentally swallowed a fishing hook that got stuck in the throat, and all doctors were at a loss. One person happened to see that although the hook was in the throat, the fishing line was fortunately outside. He used an idea to treat the situation by threading several beads onto the fishing line, sending them down one by one into the throat to place the beads against the hook’s pointy end. A quick tug, and the hook was pulled out, leading to safety.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot;: A rich family&#39;s child was choked by a chicken bone, and countless methods failed to treat it. An old man saw this and said: I have a technique to remove it without the need for medicine or bait. He urgently took new cotton and sugar and wrapped the sugar in the cotton like a large plum, then the child swallowed it down into the throat, leaving half of the cotton outside. He would occasionally pull on it, waiting for the throat to feel itchy. Suddenly, phlegm and saliva would be expelled, and the bone would stick to the cotton and come out, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>A child mistakenly swallowed a line hammer and, after consuming half a pound of syrup from a monk, it passed out through the feces in the valley. The monk said: &quot;For anything mistakenly swallowed, five metals can all be treated with syrup.&quot;</p>
<p>A small child mistakenly swallowed a gold ring. It was suggested to quickly eat cooked leeks without cutting them and swallow them together with broad beans, and within two times, the gold ring would be expelled.</p>
<p><strong>Section on Five Rescues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>To save someone from hanging: if it is day to night, even if the body is cold, treatment can still be effective. If it is from night to day, it is more difficult. This is probably due to the excessive anger. However, even in summer, when the nights are shorter and hot, one still worries about treatment. It is also said that if there is slight warmth in the heart below, treatment is possible for more than a day. </p>
<p>Gently carry the body that has just hanged; do not cut the rope. Lay the person comfortably; one person steps on both shoulders while holding a few strands of hair, ensuring they do not loosen. Another person presses down on the chest and moves it a few times. A third person massages and stretches the limbs. </p>
<p>If the body is already stiff, gradually bend the limbs and press on the abdomen. After a moment, breath may escape from the mouth and the eyes may open. Do not force anything; it is also unnecessary to exhaust oneself. In a little while, a small amount of cinnamon soup and clear porridge can be given to moisten the throat, allowing gradual swallowing to resume. It is good for two people to blow into the ears. This method is most effective, and there will be no case that cannot be revived.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>To save someone from drowning: Take two sheng of ash from the hearth to bury the person, from head to foot, until water drains from the seven orifices, then they will come back to life.</p>
<p>For those who have fainted and are unaware: Be cautious with lamps and fire, do not let anyone touch them; just pulling partway towards it will help them regain consciousness. If they cannot speak, take a chicken head from the east gate, grind it to a powder, and administer it with wine.</p>
<p>To treat sudden fainting: Mash chives and pour the juice into their nostrils; for severe cases, administer it into both ears.</p>
<p>For haunting that prevents sleep: Use minced dragon liver and blow it into the nostrils.</p>
<p>Another method: Use powdered soap pods, about the size of large beans, and blow it into the nostrils; sneezing will restore vital energy, bringing the dead back to life.</p>
<p>To ward off fainting: Use realgar the size of a jujube, tie it under the left armpit to prevent fainting for life. According to Zhongjing: men on the left, women on the right. </p>
<p>Another method: Moxibustion on the tufts of hair of both big toes, seven times each. According to the &quot;Zhouhou Fang,&quot; Huatuo used this method to save someone from sudden malevolence.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>For one who has hanged themselves, it is vital not to cut the rope. Instead, support the body with the knees or wrap it tightly with clothing to maintain pressure. Gently untie the rope and lower the body, knead the neck area, pinch the nose, and blow into both ears. Wait for the breath to return before releasing your hold. If air escapes, there may be no chance of salvation.</p>
<p>To rescue one from hanging: Calm the mind and gradually relieve the situation. Do not cut the rope; the body must be held. If the body is still warm, pricking the comb of a chicken to let its blood drip into the mouth may revive the person. </p>
<p>Another method: Take chicken droppings, white and as large as a jujube, mix with half a cup of wine, and administer through the nose for excellent results.</p>
<p>Another method: Administer blue juice (a specific herbal mixture) into the person.</p>
<p>If a person is hanged but their body has not been cold for long: Gradually lower the body, twist the throat and windpipe, pull the hair upwards, rub and stimulate the body, and perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Ignite a tube and blow air into the anus. Use pinellia tuber and soapwort in the nose, and administer ginger juice mixed with a fragrant herbal pill. Alternatively, boil wood fragrance with a fine spice soup and use it for administration; revival is possible. If the rope has left deep marks for too long, treatment will not be effective.</p>
<p>If someone falls and is knocked unconscious but their heart is still warm, they can still be saved. Position the individual as a monk would sit, and have someone lower their hair. Blow powdered pinellia into their nose, and mix ginger juice with fragrant oil to administer.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Drowning Victims:</strong> Retrieve the body and place it horizontally across a cow’s back. If no cow is available, use a stool to lift the body out of the water. In winter months, wrap the body with a woolen blanket, but administer juice from wild locust pods mixed with fresh ginger juice. Rub ginger up and down the body; this method may revive the person. If there is blood from the five orifices, do not attempt treatment.</p>
<p><strong>For Drowning Persons:</strong> Lay them on a stool to sleep, raise the back legs of the stool on two bricks, and apply salt to the navel to let the water flow out naturally. It is crucial not to tilt the body to expel water. If the individual feels slightly warm in the chest area, they can be treated.</p>
<p><strong>Another Method:</strong> For a drowning person who has been submerged for a while, they may still come back to life. Crush wild locust pods, wrap them in cloth, and insert them into the lower body; they may start to expel water and revive shortly.</p>
<p><strong>For Those in a Coma (Nightmare Death):</strong> Do not approach and call their name, but bite their heels to arouse them and spit on their face. If they do not wake, move them slightly regarding their sleeping position and call gradually. If there is a lamp, keep it; if not, do not light one.</p>
<p>If a person suddenly does not awaken, do not shine a light on them, as it may cause death. Instead, bite the area around their thumb and spit on their face to revive them. Crush garlic to extract juice, and blow it into their nostrils. In winter, use garlic roots to extract juice and administer it orally.</p>
<p><strong>Another Method:</strong> Grind realgar into powder, sift finely, and blow it into their nostrils.</p>
<p>The spirit is weak and energy is chaotic, with phlegm and wind obstructing the heart and lungs, causing dreams that lead to unconsciousness and death due to blocked energy. If the person is unresponsive and has a dark blue face, do not treat them. Quickly use a mouth-to-nose technique to clear phlegm, then administer Suhexiang pills to stimulate clear energy; movement of the body may lead to revival. If the body is motionless and features are sunken, do not treat.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The five deaths refer to death by hanging, falling, nightmare, drowning, and being crushed. People often face disasters suddenly and cannot be saved. However, deaths of this kind do not sever the internal organs; they are wrongful deaths caused by external calamities. Their souls remain close to the body, and if summoned through spiritual techniques, the souls can reattach and bring the person back to life. </p>
<p>I pass down a method involving spiritual talismans. First, write on yellow paper and burn it in heated yellow wine. Then, pry open the jaws and pour the wine down the throat. Afterward, prepare medicinal pills by mixing with yellow wine, and have the person hold the potion in their mouth before using a green onion tube to deliver it into the deceased&#39;s throat.

His father binds his hands and feet with a cloth, preventing movement, only allowing him to stand slightly. Then, he takes a jar of fresh strong wine and opens it near his son’s mouth; the strong aroma rushes into his mouth. The afflicted seeks to drink but is firmly denied. Shortly thereafter, he suddenly vomits a piece into the jar, which is wrapped and sealed with paper, and then set ablaze. After roughly half the wine evaporates, it is opened to reveal a piece resembling pig liver, weighing about three taels, with numerous tiny holes around it, and it cannot be counted.

The merchant, when jokingly drinking wine, found his face to also turn red; he had to eat anything that was offered to him. When he ate too much, he felt swelling within his temple, and if he refrained from eating, one of his arms would become numb. A skilled doctor advised him to try various medicines, including metals, stones, herbs, and woods, until he tried Fritillaria, which caused the sore to gather and close. The merchant was pleased and said: &quot;This medicine will surely cure it.&quot; He then used a small reed tube to wash it out, and after several days it formed a scab and he was healed.</p>
<p>Strange illness of a dragon: In ancient times, there was a patient who, despite eating and drinking as usual, seemed delirious, his face was green and yellow, and his lower abdomen was swollen as if he were pregnant.

Suddenly, an old man from the mountains said: &quot;I heard that in the sixth year of Kaihuang, there was a case of this illness at Baqiao. It was said that it came from eating celery by the water on March 8.&quot; A knowledgeable person remarked: &quot;This is the illness of the dragon. It arises because a dragon swam over the celery and was accidentally consumed, leading to the sickness.&quot; They then gave him a cold food syrup, five measures per dose, and after several doses he vomited something; although small, it resembled a dragon with two heads, and from then on, he recovered.</p>
<p>A sore breaks and a sparrow flies: A man developed a small sore on the upper eyelid of his left eye that was long like a duck&#39;s egg, and its root resembled a string, causing him to keep his eye closed.

The ancients had never suffered from this illness, and thus no one recognized it.</p>
<p>Regarding the inverted vision, during the late Yuan dynasty, Lu Fubei of Siming, also known as Cangzhou, was deeply knowledgeable in medicine. The Taoist Xiaoyunquan of Linchuan reported that he saw objects as inverted and asked for treatment. When asked about the cause, he said: &quot;I once got extremely drunk and vomited all the wine I drank. I slept soundly until dawn, and from then on, I acquired this illness.&quot; Upon examining his pulse, it was floating and rapid on the left side. He was told: &quot;Alcohol consumption and excessive vomiting have caused a reversal in your upper organs, leading to the distortion of your gallbladder, which is why you see everything inverted; it is not due to internal or external factors. The treatment should be to expel it again to correct your gallbladder.&quot; Hence, he used coarse powder made from donkeys’ gall and gourd seeds, boiled in water, and instructed to take it first thing in the morning, to induce vomiting as necessary. After the vomiting, his vision returned to normal.</p>
<p>As for the woman who saw objects as if they were bent like a bow, she perceived straight lines as if they were curved hooks, and no medicine could cure her.</p>
<p>In Zhenyang, there was a scholar who was fond of drinking, consuming several dou each day, and when the urge struck, he could not be restrained. One evening, in a state of great intoxication, he vomited something that resembled a tongue. At first glance, it seemed without any openings or marks, but as he wished to drink, it stood upright. His family poured wine over it until nothing remained, stopping only when they reached the daily amount he usually drank. They then threw it into a fierce fire, where it split into several pieces. From that point on, the scholar could no longer tolerate alcohol.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>The Illness of the Gluttonous Dragon</strong></p>

His family suffered from poverty for five years, and eventually, he had to beg for food. One day, he reached a house where he had already received rice at the front door but then went around to the back to beg again. </p>
<p>The family, angry, said, &quot;You’ve already received food at the front; how can we give you more at the back?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am extremely hungry and truly did not realize it was the back door.&quot; In the garden, there were three beds of garlic leeks, and he ate two of them on the spot. Soon, he lay down on the ground in distress and vomited something resembling a dragon. As it came out, it gradually shrunk in size. When people brought him rice, he no longer wanted to eat. They placed the rice on the thing he had vomited, which quickly turned into water, and this illness was soon cured.</p>

Your illness is recorded in the &quot;Suwen&quot; as &quot;food hanging.&quot; The human lungs are made up of six lobes, which expand and cover the spleen. When the maternal and child energies are in harmony, one can eat. If any disturbance occurs, the lungs cannot expand, leading to spleen dysfunction and lack of appetite. A prescription was provided to clear the energy and moisten the lungs. After three days of treatment, the patient smelled the aroma of meat and found it delicious. This was recorded by a Song dynasty writer, but upon review of the &quot;Suwen,&quot; no such ailment as &quot;food hanging&quot; is mentioned, suggesting a misattribution by the journalist.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p>

<li><p><strong>Red Silk Tumor</strong>: A person in the eastern courtyard said: &quot;I had a son, and after one year, he developed a red silk tumor and died. Later, all four of my sons had the same condition. What is the cause?&quot; The reply was: &quot;You have a hidden fire in your kidneys, and the essence has red silks due to this, commonly known as fetal tumors. You should test it with essence, and it will be confirmed. Take kidney-replenishing pills, while your wife should take the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. Afterward, she will conceive and bear children without previous issues.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Postpartum Tea Consumption</strong>: A woman, after giving birth, consumed more than twenty bowls of tea daily. A month later, she had patches of ice-coldness all over her body; if someone pressed a cold spot with a finger, it would resonate up to her heart. This continued for two years with no effectiveness from various doctors. Using an Eight-Ingredient Decoction, minus the rehmannia, and adding tangerine peel, along with a cup of ginger juice and bamboo sap, she took it ten times and felt warmth.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fainting at Thunder</strong>: A seven-year-old child fainted upon hearing thunder. After using ginseng, Angelica sinensis, and Ophiopogon, with a little Schisandra added, a syrup was prepared. After finishing the medicine, he became unaffected by thunder.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A Throat Like Another</strong>: A person felt as though there was another throat that passed obliquely below the diaphragm, reaching directly to the left side, causing a sensation of fullness and heaviness. When pressed, a dripping sound could be heard. After taking ten pills of a saliva-regulating elixir, after a short time, the heaviness turned to heat, leading to a discharge of phlegm of about two liters. After resuming food, it properly descended and reached the stomach.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Neck Swelling Connected to the Head</strong>: A man had swelling in the neck that was connected to the head, and it felt hard upon palpation. After taking a decoction of Luoluo (a type of herb), he experienced itching, and shortly after, the swelling dissipated.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Itching to the Bone Marrow</strong>: A person harvesting rice in the fields suddenly experienced itching all over as if it reached the bone marrow. This was due to phlegm and qi. Nine qian of table salt was used to soak in three bowls of water; with each bowl consumed, he would probe and vomit it out. After three bouts of this, he was no longer itchy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A Bulbous Growth from Childbirth</strong>: Danxi treated a woman with a bulbous growth under the childbirth portal that was pointed and weighed about a jin. The bleeding was excessive yet weak. She was urgently given five fen each of astragalus, baizhu, and shengma, and one qian each of ginseng and angelica, decocted in water. After taking three doses, she was cured.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ulcer in the Chest</strong>: A young woman had an ulcer in her chest that was producing pus and blood, correlating with what she coughed up. Treatment included ginseng, astragalus, and angelica, along with medications to reduce heat and drain pus, leading to recovery.</p>

<li><p><strong>Swelling of the Penile Shaft</strong>: A young man had an elongated swelling on the penile shaft, which was soft and moistened with a drooping appearance, making movement difficult. Both legs felt congested upwards, and he experienced weakness in the limbs. Initially, he was given a small dose of Chai Hu Decoction with added Huanglian to reduce damp heat, and a small amount of Huangbo to lower the rebellious qi. The swelling gradually reduced, but hardened nodules remained in the shaft. He was treated with Qingpi as the main ingredient, combined with medicinal powders to disperse wind, and externally applied a mixture of silk gourd juice with wuzhuyu, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Hardened Vulva</strong>: After giving birth, a woman lost her child and had no menstruation for six months. One day she suddenly experienced abdominal pain, with something hard like a stone blocking her vulva, causing unbearable pain. Many doctors could not identify the issue. Qinglin said: This is a stone mass. A decoction was made from Siwu Decoction, adding Tao Ren, Dahuang, Sanling, Binglang, Yan Hu Suo, Fuzi, Zexie, and Xuejie. After two doses, she recovered.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Blood Like Urine</strong>: A person had a small sore at the tip of their left ring finger, initially the size of a grain. After pricking it with a small knife, blood flowed out continuously like urine. One night, a fleshy lump like a fungus grew on the tip, forming a small opening that moved like an eye. This was a case of carbuncle. He was treated with moxibustion for forty applications without feeling pain or itch; subsequently, it was cauterized, and the lump was cut off. A topical herbal salve was applied, and an internal detoxification decoction was taken. He recovered in seven days.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Malignant Growth on Skin</strong>: A sixteen-year-old girl had malignant growths the size of soybeans on the soft skin of her limbs, half embedded in the flesh, reddish-purple and very painful. Various medications were ineffective. A practitioner advised her to purchase four ounces of mercury, rubbing it on with two sheets of white paper for three days until it fell off, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Gall Bladder Disorder</strong><br>A woman in labor became extremely frightened and fell ill. Although she recovered, her eyes remained wide open and could not close. No one could understand the issue, so they asked Qian Zhongyang who diagnosed it as a gall bladder disorder. He advised them to brew a drink with the kernels of the (mu yu) plum and give it to her until she became intoxicated, which would cure her. The reason for this is that the eyes are internally connected to the liver and gall bladder, and fear causes energy to become stagnant, preventing the gall bladder from descending. The (mu yu) plum kernels can alleviate the stagnation, entering the gall bladder along with the wine, allowing the stagnation to be relieved so that the eyes can then close. The treatment worked as described.</p>

<p><strong>Insect Sounds in the Abdomen</strong><br>Wang from Fen Zhou experienced a sound in his right side that resembled the sound of shrimp, and he often felt the need to press it, otherwise the sounds would repeat endlessly. The doctors could not discern what was wrong. Zhao Luan, a man from Liu Yang Mountain, diagnosed it as caused by fright causing qi to enter the organs. He provided a calming remedy, the Zhenshijing Zhu Shawan, which was taken with a soup made with the skin of the shrimp, and he subsequently healed. The skin of the shrimp refers to plantago.</p>

<p>The Nine Worms</p>
<p>When there are corpse worms in a woman&#39;s abdomen, they are born with the individual and can cause severe harm. The corpse worm resembles a large horse tail or thin tendons, residing in the spleen, with a front and rear, each about three inches long. There are also nine kinds of worms: </p>
<ol>
<li>The Fuzhong worm, four-tenths of a foot long; </li>
<li>The Ascaris, one foot long; </li>
<li>The White worm, one inch long; </li>
<li>The Flesh worm, resembling a rotten apricot; </li>
<li>The Lung worm, resembling a silkworm; </li>
<li>The Stomach worm, resembling a frog; </li>
<li>The Weak worm, resembling melon seeds; </li>
<li>The Red worm, resembling raw meat; </li>
<li>The Pin worm, very small, resembling a caterpillar.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fuzhong worm is the leader among the worms; the Ascaris can penetrate the heart and kill; the White worm reproduces quickly, with many offspring, causing the mother to grow large, reaching four or five inches, also capable of causing death; the Flesh worm leads to discomfort; the Lung worm causes coughing; the Stomach worm induces vomiting, with upward gastric reflux; the Weak worm, also known as the diaphragm worm, causes excessive salivation; the Red worm leads to intestinal noises; the Pin worm resides in the intestines, and when numerous, can result in hemorrhoids, severe cases causing sores and scabs. </p>
<p>Tooth worms do everything harmful; individuals need not have them all, nor in abundance; some may have them, others may not, often women have many. These worms are ferocious and are a great affliction to humans. It is recommended to bathe with white yarrow, as both its roots and leaves are useful. Not only is it a fragrant herb, but it is also feared by the corpse worms.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>In general, anyone wishing to take tonics or treat various diseases must first eliminate all parasites and phlegm and resolve lingering issues; only then can one take tonics, as otherwise the medicinal effects will not be achieved. </p>
<p>For those suffering from cold damage or epidemic fever, if there is heat in the abdomen and the person eats little, leading to emptiness in the stomach and intestines, the three parasites will seek food, eroding the five internal organs and lower parts. If there is no color around the gums, and the tongue is entirely white, in severe cases, there may be sores inside the lips, heaviness in the limbs, and an inclination to sleep. One should examine the inside of the upper lip for sores and spitting blood, and if there are sores inside the lower lip, this indicates that the parasites in the upper part erode the internal organs, while those in the lower part lead to excessive sleepiness—these parasites are often unnoticed. </p>
<p>One may take medicines to eradicate these parasites; otherwise, the hidden parasites can be deadly. Additionally, those suffering from moisture-related issues (with upper parasites hidden and lower parasites present) often have them arise after heat illness, prolonged diarrhea, or from external factors like warm, humid climates leading to such diseases. There may also be dry parasites, which do not manifest as diarrhea but can lead to sores and itching in the lower parts regardless of dry or wet conditions, ultimately becoming fatal if prolonged.</p>
<p>For moisture-related issues resulting in painful diarrhea, boiling medicinal herbs like Huang Lian, Ai Ye, and Ku Shen can be beneficial. If patients have no color around their gums, or a white tongue, experience excessive sleepiness and confusion, or have diarrhea, immediate attention to the lower parts is necessary. </p>
<p>Failure to recognize this will lead to treatments solely affecting the upper regions, neglecting the lower parts where worms may harm the anus, potentially resulting in ulceration that can cause death. Burning moxa in a bamboo tube for fumigation is advised.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Curing Methods</strong><br>(From &quot;The Essentials of the Matter&quot; by Xu Shuwei, Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>The heart worm is called &quot;hollow&quot;, the spleen worm is known as &quot;cui bai&quot;, the kidney worm resembles fine cut threads, the liver worm resembles rotten apricots, and the lung worm is akin to silkworms; all of these can be fatal. Among them, the lung worm is the most urgent, residing within the lung lobes and eroding the lung connections, thus causing tuberculosis. As a result, symptoms include coughing, spitting blood, and a hoarse voice, making treatment challenging as medicine often fails to reach it. </p>
<p>The &quot;Daoist Scriptures&quot; indicate that the heads of all worms point downward, but from the first day to the fifth day of the month, the heads point upward; thus, medications often yield better effects during this period. Additionally, Yao Kuan in &quot;West Creek Miscellaneous Talks&quot; states that all organ worms ascend, but only the lung worm descends, making it particularly difficult to treat. It is advised to grind otter claws into powder to mix with medicine and to treat on the fourth and sixth days, as on these days, the lung worm ascends. The two accounts differ slightly, but both may be retained for reference.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng (Clarifying Treatment Principles) - Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nine Insects</strong></p>
<p>Insects arise from the accumulation of dampness and heat. Observing that there is rain during the day, one understands that the growth of crops leads to the emergence of insects; this principle is clear. Zhang Dairen aptly expounded on this: water and fire are associated with spring and summer, while damp earth pertains to late summer. Water transforms from the earth, hence there are many insects. Human suffering from insect accumulation primarily arises from imbalances in hunger and satiety, as well as improper regulation. This can happen from excessive consumption of fish, raw meat, and white wine, or mistakenly eating turtles and amaranth, leading to a deficiency in the central qi and disrupted pathway of damp heat, resulting in the emergence of various white worms, which may resemble earthworms or turtles. Children are most commonly affected, but adults can also suffer. Symptoms include heart palpitations, abdominal pain, vomiting frothy saliva, pale and yellowish complexion, dark circles under the eyes and around the nose, leading to reduced food intake, muscle weakness, lethargy, and mild chills or fever. If not treated early, the condition may worsen. The ancients said: if an insect grows to a foot long, it can harm a person. If they multiply rapidly, they can cause urgent harm. Treatment entails removing the insects by addressing the accumulation with remedies such as cutting red pills, Zun Shen pills, or Yu Xian pills.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The nine worms indicate that the organs are unbalanced, with weakness in the spleen and stomach. Consuming mixed foods that are cold, fatty, oily, or salty, and irregular eating habits lead to decay and stagnation, causing disturbances. There may also be a lack of mental clarity, loss of the spirit, and heat in the five organs, along with the accumulation of residual toxins and stagnant blood. Consuming fruits and the internal organs of animals may leave behind certain types of worms. Symptoms of worms include nausea, vomiting foamy saliva, and intermittent pain that comes and goes. The small white worm is white and thin, depleting vital energy, causing weakness and back pain. The pinworm is as fine as a cabbage worm and can lead to conditions like hemorrhoids, sores, skin diseases, and abscesses. The small white worm, pinworm, and roundworm are among the nine types of worms. Additionally, there are children who suffer from malnutrition and restlessness, with rancid nasal discharge and ulcerations in the gums, resulting in dark blood in the stool. Worms affecting the lower part lead to external sores on the lower lip; those affecting the internal organs result in sores on the upper lip. The three worms refer to the long worm, the red worm, and the pinworm.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>There are nine types of parasitic worms, among which pinworms and ascarids cause many illnesses. Ascarids arise from consuming beef and drinking white wine; a length of one foot can be lethal. When treating with medicine, it is essential for the worms to be expelled completely, so that they come out wrapped together; only then is it effective. If the expulsion is incomplete, the worms will continue to proliferate, thus rapid treatment is necessary. Pinworms often affect children, but adults can also suffer from them. This condition causes heart pain, resulting in the expulsion of bile during a clear morning; agitation is also a symptom. Other types of worms are harmful as well, and since worms are present in everyone’s stomach, it is advisable to take the Nine Worm Pill to eliminate them.</p>
<p>The ascarid is one of these nine worms, typically measuring one foot in length, though some may be five to six inches long. They may become active due to a weakness in the organs or from consuming rich foods. Their activity causes abdominal pain, which can manifest as aggregations that shift up and down, producing intermittent pain. It can also lead to heart pain, heat in the abdomen, an increase in saliva, and the vomiting of clear water; if it severely injures the heart, it can lead to death. When diagnosing, if the pulse indicates abdominal pain, the pulse should ideally be weak and thin, but if it is strong and large, it indicates the presence of ascarids.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The intestinal parasite, known as the &quot;nine worms,&quot; exists in everyone’s abdomen. When a young child loses milk too early or consumes too many sweets, it can lead to a weak stomach and the movement of these worms, causing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting of clear fluids. If there are visible blue veins on the abdomen, it is effective to prepare the decoction by roasting the historical gentleman and using the shell. However, many people tend to take it before sleeping, without observing the proper timing, and thus do not find it effective. The correct approach is to take it between the fourth and fifth days of the lunar month during the fifth watch, in order to expel the worms completely by noon of that same day. Following this, one may use a warming and balancing medicine for one or two days to regulate the stomach, but not excessively. The nine worms in the abdomen orient themselves according to the lunar phases: in the first ten days of the month, they point upwards; in the middle ten days, they lie horizontally; and in the last ten days, they point downwards. Therefore, medicines taken in the middle or last ten days do not enter the worm&#39;s mouth, hence their ineffectiveness. The same principle applies to the offspring of cattle and horses: those born in the first ten days stay ahead of the mother; those born in the middle ten days walk side by side; and those born in the last ten days follow behind. Cats eat mice in a similar manner: they consume the front segment in the first ten days, the middle in the middle ten days, and the rear segment in the last ten days. This is the natural order of things, yet few recognize it.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Jing Yue Complete Works</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Zhang Jiebin</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Insects&#39; Disease</strong></p>
<p>Insects as a disease are prevalent among many people, stemming from transformation and birth, which is indeed hard to predict. In ancient medical texts, it is said that they arise from dampness, heat, indiscretions in eating and drinking, or the accumulation of food and drink. While these causes certainly exist, from common observations, it is found that those with strong organs and vigorous energy rarely have insects, as their food transforms quickly, making it difficult for insects to survive. Conversely, those with weak organ energy and sluggish transformation tend to have stagnation and consequently develop insects over time. Therefore, insects can arise from damp heat, raw or cold foods, rich and sweet foods, or from clogs and grease; it is not solely damp heat. Nonetheless, among these causes, raw and cold foods are the most likely to produce insects.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Just like storing various items, if they are placed in damp conditions or near moisture, they are most easily damaged and rotted; is this not the truth? Therefore, for anyone wanting to care for infants, it is essential to limit their fruit intake to prevent damage to their spleen, which is indeed one of the most crucial points. As for methods to treat parasites, although one should eliminate the parasites, it is equally important to address the underlying cause to prevent their recurrence. One must focus on nurturing the original energy of the spleen and kidneys, ensuring that the internal energy is strong; if this is achieved, not only will the parasites not survive, but they also cannot form in the first place. I have a prescription for warming the internal organs, which is most suitable.</p>
<p>Parasites manifest a variety of ailments; their occurrence may gradually worsen, or increase from few to many. When they become longstanding, they can cause abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and eventually lead to emaciation and danger. Symptoms associated with parasite pain are irregular; they may come and go unpredictably, involve vomiting of greenish-yellow water, or even expulsion of parasites. Pain may lead to restless sitting or lying down, severe pain that is unbearable, and changes in facial complexion, which may appear blue, yellow, or white, while the lips remain red. If the pain settles and the person can still eat and drink, this indicates a buildup of parasites, and it is crucial to expel them promptly.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Regarding remedies for insects, when the insect&#39;s strength is immediate and causes pain in the abdomen, one should use the &quot;Sweep the Insects Decoction&quot; to treat the symptoms first. If the insects are firmly accumulated, one should use pills like &quot;Hunting Insect Pill,&quot; &quot;Encounter Immortal Pill,&quot; &quot;Wood Fragrance Betel Nut Pill,&quot; or &quot;Hundred Smooth Pills&quot; to address the issue. If the condition is somewhat milder and the substance is weaker, remedies like &quot;Epilobium Powder&quot; or &quot;Transform Insect Powder&quot; should be used. Danxi mentions that effective insect treatments use the root of the Chinese toon tree, betel nut, and crane louse, taking the juice in summer and making a strong decoction in winter. Moreover, the &quot;Universal Response Pill&quot; is particularly excellent.</p>
<p>In terms of methods for treating insects, according to Danxi, it&#39;s easier to treat when the insect&#39;s head is facing upward in the first half of the month; however, it becomes difficult when the head is facing downward in the latter half. One should first draw the insect&#39;s head upward with meat juice or syrup, then apply the medicine, as this is a wise strategy. Yet, this is a method for slower treatment. If the insect condition is very urgent, how can one afford to wait for the right timing? Moreover, to distinguish the direction of the insect&#39;s head by looking forward and backward is rather vague and lacks evidence. Only by using fragrant bait can one attract the insect&#39;s head; is it not true that there is also a method for treating it by looking backward? Why worry about difficulties in treatment?</p>
<p>Xu Donggao states that there are indeed many remedies for treating insects, but those who use them may not understand the methods and thus cannot eliminate the insects. As Danxi said, when insects wish to go downward, one must wait for them to face upward, and the methods should be employed before the middle of the month.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>If a worm finds food, it will not eat medicine, nor can it be expelled, leading merely to a drainage of its void. Therefore, even with a prescription, if one does not understand its method, the prescription will be ineffective. Whenever one wishes to expel worms, one must first refrain from eating for a day to make the worms hungry. Then, early at dawn, one should chew meat fried in oil for a long time, so that the worms in the abdomen smell the aroma of the meat, all turning upwards, desiring to eat. Then, take a chicken egg and mix it with the medicine to chew and consume it. Shortly after, drink scallion broth or plain water, a little bit at a time to assist the medicine’s downward action. Without exceeding the time, all the worms will be expelled, sometimes by the volume of several sheng. Then, replenish with plain porridge, continuously taking restorative agents to adjust the spleen and stomach, and the illness can be entirely cured.</p>
<p>An example of this treatment method: Once, a person suffered from severe abdominal pain, sometimes ceasing and sometimes intensifying, unbearable to endure. Although various medicines to remove accumulation and regulate qi were used, none were effective. At the site of the pain, one must strike it with a fist, causing the pain to lessen for a while, but it would soon return, leading to prolonged suffering without understanding the cause. Suddenly, a monk appeared and said: &quot;I can treat this.&quot; The patient was then instructed to first eat fragrant bait, followed by a pill, which expelled a strange, hard-mouthed worm, resulting in recovery. This was due to the worm gnawing at the intestines, causing extreme pain; striking it would vibrate the inner organs, making the worm afraid and retreat. If not struck, the worm would roam freely, hence the pain would reoccur. This is verification of the unique method for dealing with worms. Thus, whenever one observes symptoms of abdominal pain, if pressing or kneading temporarily alleviates the pain, it is often due to the presence of worms.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Roundworm</strong></p>
<p>Among all worms, the roundworm is the most numerous. The methods to expel it are as previously mentioned. However, it can grow back as quickly as it is expelled, which is ultimately not a good strategy. To eliminate it at the source, one must strengthen the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are strong, the worms will not arise. Therefore, whether after expelling the worms or before, if one wishes to replenish the spleen and stomach, decoctions like Gui Pi Tang, Wen Wei Yin, Wu Jun Zi Jian, Li Zhong Tang, or the remedy for nourishing Yin are suitable. If one seeks to treat the worms at the same time, the best method is the Wen Zang Wan. The methods for treating worms can be either aggressive or nurturing, and one should attend to the appropriate timing and order; careful discernment is necessary and should not be neglected casually. Cao&#39;s &quot;Sources of Illness&quot; states: For abdominal pain, if the pulse is sinking and weak, it indicates something else, but if the pulse is surging and large, it signifies roundworms.</p>
<p><strong>Thin White Worm</strong><a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>This insect is about an inch long, white in color, and resembles maggots. There are those that live alone and those that are connected, which is why they can grow up to one or two zhang (about 3-6 meters). To treat this small white insect, there’s nothing better than frying with nut seeds; its effect is miraculous.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s worm ailments</p>
<p>The children&#39;s worm ailment, known as &quot;gan&quot; (upper hidden lower worm), is caused by excessive harm from food intake, leading to accumulation of &quot;gan&quot;. Symptoms include body heat, a bloated abdomen, a yellowish face, weakness in the limbs, lethargy, a foul-smelling nasal discharge, and sores on the gums. There may be diarrhea with black blood, all due to worms in the abdomen. It is advisable to use formulas such as Nine Flavors Aloe Pill, Chasing Worm Pill, Four Flavor Nourishing Child Pill, Seven Flavor Nourishing Child Pill, and Toad Pills for treatment. After the worms are expelled, one should continue to tonify qi and blood.</p>
<p>Insect pain</p>
<p>The symptom of insect pain is that eating reduces the pain, while not eating increases it. Test with a cup of sour plum soup; if pain stops after drinking, it is insect pain; if drinking increases the pain or only slightly reduces it, then it is not insect pain. The prescription includes two liang of white atractylodes, one liang each of tree root and white smartweed, three qian each of coptis, dried plum core, fried evodia, gardenia, poria, licorice, and turtle shell, all ground to powder and mixed with honey to form pills the size of millet. These should be administered when the person is hungry and craving food. After taking these pills, the pain will surely be intense; do not give them water immediately, as water helps the worms thrive. The brilliance of this formula lies in its ability to strengthen the spleen while using ingredients to kill the worms.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>Since it is a medicine for killing insects, why must we wait until they are hungry to begin the extermination? When there is no food in the stomach, the insects cannot be nourished; their mouths will naturally turn upward to seek food. When they are hungry and empty, their heads will point upward, not downward. If food is given to them, they will certainly think it is food and all rush to compete for it. But when the mouth contradicts their nature, they will stir and jump, causing greater pain. If water is forbidden, then every part of their body—ears, eyes, mouth, and nose—will be contaminated by the medicinal vapor, attacking from within and without, leading only to death. If one does not know this restriction and still gives them water, the insects will take advantage and thrash about, bathing; with more water than medicine, they will naturally break apart, killing only half of them and not uprooting the grass. Therefore, one must endure a moment of pain to eliminate the lifelong suffering. I hope people can endure it! Also, a dose of three qian of rhubarb can be added; it can also be omitted. If there is pain above the abdomen, it is not suitable to increase the dosage; if there is pain below the abdomen, it should be increased.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Formulae</strong>  </p>

It should be taken at the break of dawn when the rooster crows, using cold tea for consumption. Additionally, one should collect excrement in a chamber pot and observe it in an open field to easily identify the effects of the medicine, whether it be parasites or accumulated matter, which may resemble rotten fish or various colored accumulations. If no parasites or accumulations are seen after the first attempt, one should check again a second or third time; this indicates the root of the illness. The accumulation will dissolve, the qi will disperse, the parasites will be expelled, and lumps will diminish. If the root of the illness is removed, the ailment will resolve itself. If the condition is mild, a single dose will show results. However, if the source is deeply rooted, a second dose may be necessary, which can clear seasonal accumulations. In spring, it resolves stagnant accumulation, preventing sores and toxins; in summer, it dispels summer heat and dampness, preventing heat-related issues; in autumn, it disperses phlegm and fluids, preventing pestilence; and in winter, it expels wind and cold, preventing epidemics. This medicine is gentle and does not disturb the true qi of the body, nor does it have adverse effects. It is not suitable for children to take fully or for pregnant women to use.

<p>For pinworms: Use 2 liang of good salt powder and half a sheng of bitter wine, boil in a copper vessel for several boils, do not eat the night before, and take on an empty stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Three Worms Formula</strong>: 2 liang of pearls, crushed as big as a chicken egg, burnt and ground to fine powder, diluted with bitter wine, taken on an empty stomach in the morning.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Roundworm Treatment:</strong></p>
<p>For roundworms: Use a decoction of yam and take it with a small amount of a specific preparation, and you won&#39;t notice the symptoms fading. </p>
<p>For heat-related issues with roundworms: Use ten parts yam, two parts each of varnish and bamboo, sifted and brewed with a cup of rice water, consumed three times a day.</p>
<p>When roundworms are in the stomach, gradually weakening the person: Take one liter each of strong wine, good varnish, and white honey. Mixture should be simmered in a copper vessel until it can form pills, about the size of a peach pit. Take it mixed in warm wine on an empty stomach without eating overnight; take it again the next morning, and the worms will surely be expelled. If not, take it again.</p>
<p>Another method: Take the seeds of the melia, soak them in bitter strong wine for an overnight exposure, wrap in cotton, and place it three inches into the rectum, changing it daily.</p>
<p>For abdominal pain caused by roundworms: Take two pounds of coix root, shred it, boil with seven liters of water until three liters remain, and take it before meals; the worms will die and be expelled.</p>
<p>Another remedy: Take evodia fruit and bitter wine, ingest a small amount on an empty stomach, and it will heal you.</p>

<p>For inch white worms: Take one liter of sesame seeds and ten taels of wheat flour, mix them into a powder, and eat it on an empty stomach with pork broth until gone, and you will be cured.</p>
<p>Another remedy: Take the roots of evodia dried and cleaned, cut one liter, soak in one liter of wine overnight, and divide into two doses to be taken in the morning. The finer the roots and those that grow in the northern shade are better; if it is larger than a fingertip, do not use it.</p>
<p>Another method: Take pomegranate roots in the same way as evodia; it can also be boiled in water.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Here are the translated texts:</p>
<p>Another formula: Grind hemp to extract five liters of juice and divide into five doses. It also treats children&#39;s roundworms. </p>
<p>Another formula: Cut three liters of white mulberry root skin, boil with seven liters of water to extract two liters, fast overnight, and take on an empty stomach at dawn.</p>
<p>Another formula: Take 27 betel nuts, treat for diarrhea with two and a half liters of water. First boil the skin to extract one and a half liters, remove the dregs, and take frequently while keeping warm. If worms come out or are not fully expelled, continue to take until cured. Do not eat overnight; take in the morning.</p>
<p>For sores in the lower part: A thick decoction of peach skin resembling syrup can be applied to the lower part; for sores in the mouth, hold it in.</p>
<p>For dampness (concealing lower worms): Take fresh ginger, peel, and finely chop and grind to extract one and a half liters of juice, then mix with one and a half liters of water and take on an empty stomach at dawn. Also, peel two pieces of fresh ginger, about the size of cocoons, and wrap them multiple times in catalpa leaves and bitter peach leaves, then burn them in hot ash until extremely hot, and take them in the lower part of the body shortly after. If dampness is severe, repeat every three days until it is cured.</p>
<p>Another formula: Burn horseshoe ash to a powder, mix with pig fat, and apply in the lower part four to five times a day.</p>
<p>For itching from large hole worms: Steam large dates to extract their paste, mix with mercury to form a three-inch long strip, wrap in cotton, and insert into the large hole overnight; the worms will all come out by the next morning. However, mercury can harm the intestines, so caution is advised.</p>
<p>For worms eroding the lower part: Combine equal parts of gypsum powder and realgar into a powder and place inside the vaginal canal.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Intestinal Worms:</strong> Take the root of the bitter neem tree that hasn&#39;t been uprooted, peel off the skin, and take two taels of the inner white bark. Boil it in three bowls of water until only one and a half bowls remain, then strain it. On an empty stomach, first chew a piece of roasted meat to direct the worms upwards, then consume one or two mouthfuls of the medicinal porridge made from three cups of rice, and gradually increase to one bowl. This will ensure the worms descend completely and the patient recovers.</p>
<p><strong>For Febrile Illness with Sleepiness:</strong> If there is excessive sleep leading to dampness (with the worms hidden above and below), accompanied by pain in the limbs and inability to eat, prepare ten pounds of warm peach fruit. Cut and mash it until cooked, then soak it in three dou of warm water. At noon, have the patient sit down and consume the preparation for three times. This will lead to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>For Treating Hot Illness with Worm Toxins:</strong> If the patient feels lethargic and is unaware of the painful area, and displays a ruddy complexion like being drunk, with diarrhea of pus and blood, one should closely examine the size of the openings at the lower part of the body. If they are faintly red, it indicates sores with worms hiding above and below, which may be life-threatening. The affliction can penetrate the liver and lungs, and if treated with medicine does not heal, one can perform fumigation. </p>
<p>Make a small clay jar capable of holding one liter, and use a bamboo tube, as thick as a finger, to connect one end into the jar and the other end shallowly into the oral cavity. Burn mugwort that is about the size of an egg inside the jar, blowing the smoke into the person&#39;s abdomen. Continue until the mugwort is consumed. Adults may use more mugwort; for children, use less. Those who are weak should not use much, as it may harm them. It should be done twice a day, but no more than three times. The worms will die and be expelled. Alternatively, one can burn realgar powder and use it for fumigation in the same way.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Method for Treating Roundworms:</strong> Take two sets of silkworm pupae and crush them thoroughly. Strain the juice through a cloth and consume it on an empty stomach. If silkworms are unavailable, you must collect the pupae in due time, drying them to a fine powder. Use this powder, in appropriate amounts as per your discretion, mixed with congee and take it.</p>
<p><strong>For Small White Worms:</strong> Use forty-nine Chinese Torreya nuts, remove the skin, and take seven on an empty stomach at dawn during the first ten days of the lunar month. Consume all in seven days; the worms will dissolve into water and be eliminated permanently. Alternatively, consuming all seven at once for a full week will transform the worms into water. In another method, take one hundred nuts and burn them to eat them entirely; this is best. If unable, just eat fifty, and the worms will pass by morning. This also treats the three corpse worms. </p>
<p><strong>Another Method:</strong> Use four grams of black lead ash, stir-fried for one dose. First, eat a small amount of pork jerky, then take half a cup of diluted sugar water mixed with the ash at dawn. The worms will be expelled, and consuming white congee for a day afterward is beneficial. During the Xuande era, I often felt an unsettling commotion in my heart, suspecting it was caused by drinking or possibly by worms. Following the prescribed treatments, I expelled two worms the next day, one measuring two and a half feet, with a broad head and sharp tail, segmented like a pattern, and it was completely fragmented.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>In cases of insect infestation in the lower part, when there is anal discharge and the intestines are pierced: take one large green-backed toad, one part of chicken bone, burn them to ash, mix and blow into the lower part, allowing it to penetrate deeply; apply repeatedly for effect.</p>
<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states: in the intestines, there are parasitic insects, such as tapeworms and roundworms, which cannot be treated with small needles. For pain in the heart and intestines, with paroxysmal pain, swelling that alternates in direction, pain that has breaks, abdominal heat, a preference for thirst, and saliva production—this indicates the presence of tapeworms or roundworms. By pressing firmly with the hand and holding it in place, preventing any movement, one can then use a large needle to puncture it and hold it for a long time. When the insect does not move, only then remove the needle. This approach also addresses heart and abdominal pain, particularly in the upper body. </p>
<p>Emperor Huang asked: What energy causes a person to produce saliva? Qibo replied: All food and drink enter the stomach; if there is heat in the stomach, then insects are activated. When insects are activated, the stomach relaxes; when the stomach relaxes, the channels are opened, resulting in saliva production, thus supplementing the lesser yin.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Records</strong></p>
<p>In the residence of the military officer Mao Jing, appointed to Yongzhou, he suffered from a peculiar ailment where every time he spoke, there was a corresponding sound in his throat. A Daoist taught him to recite the names of herbs. When he reached the term for &quot;blue,&quot; he fell silent. Then he took juice from seven blue plants and drank it; shortly after, he vomited out chunks of flesh measuring over an inch long, distinctly human in form. After that, he no longer had the odd sound.</p>
<p>In another instance, Yang Nian, who had an unusual ailment, would have a small sound in his belly every time he responded during conversations. Over the years, this sound grew louder. A Daoist, upon seeing him, exclaimed that it was a &quot;responsive bug.&quot; After a long time without treatment, it even affected his wife and children. It was advisable to read the herb texts and to take medicine when encountering a bug that didn&#39;t respond. Yang followed this advice and read until he reached the entry for &quot;thunder pill.&quot; When the bug was silent, he took the herb and was cured. Later, after arriving in Changsha, he met a beggar who had a similar ailment. Yang observed him closely and suggested taking the thunder pill, and the beggar was also cured.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Ding Zhi,&quot; in Qizhou, a scholar named Zhang Bin was invited by a local official to stay at his residence. Bin had a fondness for alcohol and would place several liters at the corner of his bed every night. One night, he forgot to prepare it, and at midnight, feeling very thirsty, he searched for it but couldn&#39;t find it. Furious and restless, he began to shout. Shortly thereafter, he vomited something onto the ground. In the morning, upon inspection, he saw pieces of flesh under the bed, yellow like liver and resembling a honeycomb, still slightly moving. He poured alcohol over it, and it made a chirping sound. He suddenly realized this was the root cause of his lifelong drinking problem, quickly threw it into the fire, and thereafter no longer drank.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>In &quot;Geng Zhi,&quot; it is recorded that Zhao Zi, styled Jing Gao, resided in Tianwang Temple in Shaowu County. He suffered from the torment of a tiny white worm. The doctor advised him to stop drinking wine, but he was unable to resist his craving for it. One evening, after getting drunk outside, he returned home past midnight, feeling thirsty and dry in the throat, and hurriedly had no tea or drink. By chance, there was a jar of water under the corridor, shimmering beautifully in the moonlight. He scooped it up and drank, finding it as sweet as honey. After drinking several mouthfuls, he went to bed. When dawn broke, the worms emerged in abundance from his body, and he felt a sudden relief in his stomach, leading to his illness being cured. His family was astonished and examined the reason; it turned out that the temple servant daily wove straw shoes, soaking them in water from red vine roots.</p>
<p>Wang Shaoshi, while outside the barrier of the pass, fell ill and over several months his flesh and muscles wasted away. Every day he struggled to swallow food, but soon his abdomen felt as if thousands of worms were attacking, both itching and painful, and he was thought to be suffering from exhaustion and a wasting disease. At that time, Zhang Rui was in Chengdu, and Wang sent a courier to summon him. When Rui arrived in Xingyuan, he took Wang&#39;s pulse and advised him to endure hunger tomorrow morning and refrain from eating anything while waiting for Rui to make a plan. The next morning, it was scorching hot. Wang asked one of his strong servants to go ten miles away to fetch a silver bowl of yellow soil from the road, instructing the cook to prepare noodles for lunch. Only when it was noon did they manage to eat, just as the soil was delivered. Then, he warmed a liter of wine, mixed the soil into it, and provided Wang with a hundred pills to drink. Wang felt a painful tug in his intestines and was nearly unable to bear it, urgently needing to relieve himself. Rui secretly instructed to prepare another hole for this purpose, and promptly urged Wang to go there.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>In a moment, a storm rained down as if it were being poured out, foul and terrible, with more than a thousand locusts. They twisted and coiled, and half of them were already dead. Wu was greatly exhausted, leaning against a bamboo couch, and after a while, he managed to eat a bowl of porridge, which took three days to settle. </p>
<p>He began to believe that last year, when he marched out on a summer night, he became parched and thirsty on the way. He ordered the soldiers to bring a horse trough to draw water from the stream. Just as it entered his mouth, it felt like there was something in it, but before he could spit it out, it went straight down his throat. Since then, he fell ill. </p>
<p>Rui said: &quot;The locusts have entered the liver and spleen, and they must breed. Daily, when food is encountered, they gather in the dantian, sucking the essence and blood, and when full, they spread to the four limbs. If one only knows how to kill them but cannot eradicate them completely, then it is of no benefit.&quot; </p>
<p>Rui thus requested the lord to empty his stomach to lure them out, for these insects love wine and have long been deprived of earthy flavors; driven by hunger, they gather all at once, thus any remedy could wash them away. Wu was overjoyed, offered generous gifts of gold and silk, and sent him home.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>Cai Dingfu&#39;s son, Kang Ji, suffered greatly due to torment from a parasitic worm. A physician instructed him to grind betel nuts into a fine powder and to boil the roots of pomegranate with water to drink as a remedy. First, he roasted a large piece of fatty pork, placed it in his mouth, chewed it to extract the juices, but did not swallow. It was said that the worm only showed itself three days before the new moon, with its head facing upwards; it could be attacked with medicine during that time. After that, on the remaining days, its head would turn downwards, and any medicine would be ineffective. The worm was attracted to the aroma of the meat, which made it swarm eagerly, leading to a sensation in the chest as if wounded by thousands of arrows; that was the signal to drink the medicine. Cai followed the instructions closely. Within moments, his stomach rumbled violently, and he rushed to the toilet; the worms fell out like pouring water. He commanded his servant to use a stick to pry them out, and they came out in a long string, several feet long, still wriggling. He threw them into a stream, and his longstanding ailment was suddenly cured.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>&quot;Guest News&quot; states: In Qingyang, the Qiqi family has long been engaged in medicine, serving in Jiangyin as a training instructor. The father of a Confucian scholar suffered from abdominal bloating and sought his diagnosis. The doctor said: &quot;The pulse is strong and large, indicating damp heat and the presence of parasites. Since his diet has been normal, it is not a case of water retention or bloating.&quot; Using pomegranate peel, the root of the ailanthus tree, and areca nut, each weighing five qian, he boiled these three ingredients in long-flowing water and had him take it on an empty stomach. Shortly after, he experienced severe abdominal pain and expelled a worm over ten feet long, resulting in his recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;The Secret Records of the Stone Chamber&quot; states: Chen Deng suffered from severe chest discomfort, a flushed face, and inability to eat or drink. I suggested that there was a worm in his chest, likely because he had consumed raw food. I prescribed three qian each of pinellia, ginseng, and licorice, along with seven gourd tops and one qian of dried tangerine peel to induce vomiting. He expelled worms that filled three sheng, all with red heads and tails like fish. I warned that if he could refrain from alcohol and rich foods, he might fully recover; otherwise, he would surely die of fullness within three years. Deng did not heed my advice, and three years later, he indeed died.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　凡物哽者，盖以食入喉而不顺，致物刺住而不能下，推之以理，反而上出则为顺焉。为治者即当涌吐，乘其饮食之出而上逆，此其顺而易为，如拔刺之法也。若刺之深者，必欲推下，非惟理势不能延迟，日久则咽哽渐肿，其刺愈深，腹中饮食消尽，虽欲涌吐而无推送之物矣，欲食而不能下，如此因循，多致不救。　　凡治哽，所伤之物下咽，不可便与米汤米饭吃，恐米粒入疮口中，且吃羹数日为美。后单方中咒，能治一切诸物诸骨，并丝发缠喉不下。《内经》曰：不因气动而生病于外者，愚意宜用藏经咒法治之是也。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p>For those who treat illnesses, they must treat according to the type of ailment. Is it appropriate to use a cormorant to handle a fish bone obstruction, or a tiger to deal with a bone blockage? However, matters like bamboo strips, garlic, chewing tendons, and honey can be universally applied.</p>
<p><strong>From Type Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze states: All treatment methods follow the type. For instance, cormorants and otters treat fish bones, magnets treat needles, ash treats hair, and tigers address various bone issues, all corresponding to their kinds.</p>
<p><strong>The Most Excellent Method of Inducing Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For objects lodged in the throat, it generally results from food entering and not going down, causing obstruction. If one pushes by reasoning, inducing it to come upwards is the proper way. Therefore, the practitioner should induce vomiting, taking advantage of the upward motion of food. This is straightforward and akin to removing a thorn. If the obstruction is deep, one must push it down; otherwise, the principle and force cannot be delayed, and over time, the throat obstruction may swell further, with food in the belly consumed. Although one may want to induce vomiting, there will be nothing to push if the obstruction worsens, leading to an inability to eat. Following this pattern may ultimately lead to dire consequences.</p>
<p>In treating obstructions, one should not hastily provide rice soup or rice, fearing that rice grains may enter the wound. It is better to consume soups for several days. The subsequent formula mentioned, which can treat all kinds of objects and bone obstructions, even threads tangled in the throat. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: If illness arises externally without being due to internal energy movement, it is foolish to believe one can treat it using hidden scripture spells.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Methods for Removing Choking Obstructions</strong></p>
<p>To remove a choking obstruction, take deer sinew, soak it until soft, and form it into a ball the size of a marble. Tie it with thread, hold one end of the sinew, and swallow it down the throat. Push it to the obstruction, then gradually pull it out to remove the blockage.</p>
<p>Another method: create a smooth bamboo strip, wrap it with cotton, and insert it into the throat at the obstruction. It can be pushed or pulled, and the obstruction will come out.</p>
<p>Another method: take two taels of cotton, heat it with honey until hot, and use it to press gently over the obstruction from the outside. If it does not come out, boil another piece of cotton to replace the used one, and also blow a little soap pod powder into the nose to induce sneezing, which will help expel the obstruction.</p>
<p>Another method: boil garlic bulbs until half-cooked, chew them slightly, tie a string around the center of the garlic, swallow it while holding the string, and when it reaches the obstruction, pull the string to remove the blockage.</p>
<p>Another method: take powdered tiger bone or raccoon bone, and consume a piece the size of a thumb.</p>
<p>Another method: take powdered chuan mu, and consume a piece the size of a thumb.</p>
<p>For fish bone obstruction: use cormorant droppings and consume a piece the size of a thumb.</p>

<p>According to &quot;The Confucian Door to Filiality&quot;: A small child accidentally swallowed a coin, which became lodged in the throat, and all the doctors were unable to remove it or allow it to go down. Then they ordered a person to help. This person thought carefully and suddenly devised a plan: take clean white paper, roll it into a shape like a chopstick, and cut the ends in a crosswise manner to create a frayed appearance. Then, separately take a chopstick and tie a hook to its end, ensuring it cannot come off. First, swallow it down lightly while gently pulling and pushing to feel for the hook in the coin’s opening. Then use the paper roll to swallow it, allowing the hook&#39;s tip to touch the end of the paper roll without harming the flesh, and pull it out.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Medical Sayings&quot;: A child accidentally swallowed a fishing hook that got stuck in the throat, and all doctors were at a loss. One person happened to see that although the hook was in the throat, the fishing line was fortunately outside. He used an idea to treat the situation by threading several beads onto the fishing line, sending them down one by one into the throat to place the beads against the hook’s pointy end. A quick tug, and the hook was pulled out, leading to safety.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot;: A rich family&#39;s child was choked by a chicken bone, and countless methods failed to treat it. An old man saw this and said: I have a technique to remove it without the need for medicine or bait. He urgently took new cotton and sugar and wrapped the sugar in the cotton like a large plum, then the child swallowed it down into the throat, leaving half of the cotton outside. He would occasionally pull on it, waiting for the throat to feel itchy. Suddenly, phlegm and saliva would be expelled, and the bone would stick to the cotton and come out, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>To save someone from hanging: if it is day to night, even if the body is cold, treatment can still be effective. If it is from night to day, it is more difficult. This is probably due to the excessive anger. However, even in summer, when the nights are shorter and hot, one still worries about treatment. It is also said that if there is slight warmth in the heart below, treatment is possible for more than a day. </p>
<p>Gently carry the body that has just hanged; do not cut the rope. Lay the person comfortably; one person steps on both shoulders while holding a few strands of hair, ensuring they do not loosen. Another person presses down on the chest and moves it a few times. A third person massages and stretches the limbs. </p>
<p>If the body is already stiff, gradually bend the limbs and press on the abdomen. After a moment, breath may escape from the mouth and the eyes may open. Do not force anything; it is also unnecessary to exhaust oneself. In a little while, a small amount of cinnamon soup and clear porridge can be given to moisten the throat, allowing gradual swallowing to resume. It is good for two people to blow into the ears. This method is most effective, and there will be no case that cannot be revived.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For one who has hanged themselves, it is vital not to cut the rope. Instead, support the body with the knees or wrap it tightly with clothing to maintain pressure. Gently untie the rope and lower the body, knead the neck area, pinch the nose, and blow into both ears. Wait for the breath to return before releasing your hold. If air escapes, there may be no chance of salvation.</p>
<p>To rescue one from hanging: Calm the mind and gradually relieve the situation. Do not cut the rope; the body must be held. If the body is still warm, pricking the comb of a chicken to let its blood drip into the mouth may revive the person. </p>
<p>Another method: Take chicken droppings, white and as large as a jujube, mix with half a cup of wine, and administer through the nose for excellent results.</p>
<p>Another method: Administer blue juice (a specific herbal mixture) into the person.</p>
<p>If a person is hanged but their body has not been cold for long: Gradually lower the body, twist the throat and windpipe, pull the hair upwards, rub and stimulate the body, and perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Ignite a tube and blow air into the anus. Use pinellia tuber and soapwort in the nose, and administer ginger juice mixed with a fragrant herbal pill. Alternatively, boil wood fragrance with a fine spice soup and use it for administration; revival is possible. If the rope has left deep marks for too long, treatment will not be effective.</p>
<p>If someone falls and is knocked unconscious but their heart is still warm, they can still be saved. Position the individual as a monk would sit, and have someone lower their hair.

If no cow is available, use a stool to lift the body out of the water. In winter months, wrap the body with a woolen blanket, but administer juice from wild locust pods mixed with fresh ginger juice. Rub ginger up and down the body; this method may revive the person. If there is blood from the five orifices, do not attempt treatment.</p>
<p><strong>For Drowning Persons:</strong> Lay them on a stool to sleep, raise the back legs of the stool on two bricks, and apply salt to the navel to let the water flow out naturally. It is crucial not to tilt the body to expel water. If the individual feels slightly warm in the chest area, they can be treated.</p>

<p><strong>For Those in a Coma (Nightmare Death):</strong> Do not approach and call their name, but bite their heels to arouse them and spit on their face. If they do not wake, move them slightly regarding their sleeping position and call gradually. If there is a lamp, keep it; if not, do not light one.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five deaths refer to death by hanging, falling, nightmare, drowning, and being crushed. People often face disasters suddenly and cannot be saved. However, deaths of this kind do not sever the internal organs; they are wrongful deaths caused by external calamities. Their souls remain close to the body, and if summoned through spiritual techniques, the souls can reattach and bring the person back to life. </p>
<p>I pass down a method involving spiritual talismans. First, write on yellow paper and burn it in heated yellow wine. Then, pry open the jaws and pour the wine down the throat. Afterward, prepare medicinal pills by mixing with yellow wine, and have the person hold the potion in their mouth before using a green onion tube to deliver it into the deceased&#39;s throat. In a moment, they may come back to life. The medicinal pill is known as the &quot;Rescue from Death Elixir.&quot; </p>
<p>It consists of two qian each of goat&#39;s blood, calamus, and perilla leaf, three qian each of ginseng and processed pinellia, and one qian each of safflower, soap pod thorn, and musk, all ground into powder. Mix with honey to form pills the size of longan pits, and dissolve in wine for use. This preparation is particularly effective on the Dragon Boat Festival. If needed immediately, one-tenth of the prescribed amount will suffice. This method is extremely miraculous; if prepared in advance, it can greatly save lives. If the time is close, delaying will not help. This method not only saves from the five deaths but can also be administered to those who faint due to malevolent spirits, allowing for revival.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Large Intestine Obstruction</strong><br>A person experiences pain with more than an inch protruding from the large intestine, feeling as if it&#39;s ready to burst. If it recedes and then emerges again, it is called &quot;intestine obstruction disease.&quot; If the intestine is completely obstructed, it cannot be treated, but if there is just an inch involved, treatment is possible. Use refined sesame oil and apply it directly to the affected area while sitting on it; also drink several liters of large sesame seed oil to recover.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Discharge Like Shrimp</strong><br>A person has foul-smelling liquid flowing from the nose, which can be collected in a bowl.

<li><p><strong>Flesh Flies Like a Butterfly</strong>: A person, due to being treated with moxa, has scabs that fall off, revealing fresh patches of flesh inside the wound, which float away in butterfly shapes, causing unbearable pain.

Although they endured the pain to remove one stalk, it soon regrew. This was due to excessive consumption of pig and sheep&#39;s blood.

<p><strong>Blood Emergence from Hair Follicles</strong><br>A person experiences bleeding from their hair follicles in stages, and if there is no blood, the skin will swell like a drum. In a moment, the eyes, nose, and mouth will all swell; this is called &quot;pulse overflow.&quot; Drinking a mixture of ginger juice and water, each one or two cups, will bring relief.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Damage and Heat</strong><br>A person suddenly gasps for breath, unable to speak, with saliva flowing from the mouth and trembling teeth. If the breath becomes labored, they may faint; if revived, the cycle could repeat. This condition is called &quot;cold damage combined with heat and cholera.&quot; Use equal parts of rhubarb and ginseng powder, about half a tael each, mixed in three cups of water, boiled down to one cup, strain, and drink hot for relief.</p>
<p><strong>Fleshy Balls in the Mouth</strong><br>A person develops a foul-smelling fleshy ball in the mouth, which they despise seeing. It has a root-like line over five inches long resembling a hairpin. The ball must be expelled before they can eat or drink. Squeezing it lightly causes intense pain. Use water to mix and take one tael of musk for several days to see results.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

Then, he takes a jar of fresh strong wine and opens it near his son’s mouth; the strong aroma rushes into his mouth. The afflicted seeks to drink but is firmly denied.

After roughly half the wine evaporates, it is opened to reveal a piece resembling pig liver, weighing about three taels, with numerous tiny holes around it, and it cannot be counted. This is discarded into the river, and the person returns to normal eating, although they can no longer drink even a drop of wine.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

The merchant, when jokingly drinking wine, found his face to also turn red; he had to eat anything that was offered to him. When he ate too much, he felt swelling within his temple, and if he refrained from eating, one of his arms would become numb. A skilled doctor advised him to try various medicines, including metals, stones, herbs, and woods, until he tried Fritillaria, which caused the sore to gather and close.

Suddenly, an old man from the mountains said: &quot;I heard that in the sixth year of Kaihuang, there was a case of this illness at Baqiao. It was said that it came from eating celery by the water on March 8.&quot; A knowledgeable person remarked: &quot;This is the illness of the dragon. It arises because a dragon swam over the celery and was accidentally consumed, leading to the sickness.&quot; They then gave him a cold food syrup, five measures per dose, and after several doses he vomited something; although small, it resembled a dragon with two heads, and from then on, he recovered.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The body gradually shrinks; there is a strange illness that ultimately no one can comprehend. In the past, Lu Jinshu was appointed to govern Yingzhou. Suddenly, he fell ill, and his body shrank day by day, becoming unhealable. At his end, he was as small as a child. The ancients had never suffered from this illness, and thus no one recognized it.</p>
<p>Regarding the inverted vision, during the late Yuan dynasty, Lu Fubei of Siming, also known as Cangzhou, was deeply knowledgeable in medicine. The Taoist Xiaoyunquan of Linchuan reported that he saw objects as inverted and asked for treatment. When asked about the cause, he said: &quot;I once got extremely drunk and vomited all the wine I drank. I slept soundly until dawn, and from then on, I acquired this illness.&quot; Upon examining his pulse, it was floating and rapid on the left side. He was told: &quot;Alcohol consumption and excessive vomiting have caused a reversal in your upper organs, leading to the distortion of your gallbladder, which is why you see everything inverted; it is not due to internal or external factors. The treatment should be to expel it again to correct your gallbladder.&quot; Hence, he used coarse powder made from donkeys’ gall and gourd seeds, boiled in water, and instructed to take it first thing in the morning, to induce vomiting as necessary. After the vomiting, his vision returned to normal.</p>
<p>As for the woman who saw objects as if they were bent like a bow, she perceived straight lines as if they were curved hooks, and no medicine could cure her.</p>
<p>In Zhenyang, there was a scholar who was fond of drinking, consuming several dou each day, and when the urge struck, he could not be restrained. One evening, in a state of great intoxication, he vomited something that resembled a tongue. At first glance, it seemed without any openings or marks, but as he wished to drink, it stood upright. His family poured wine over it until nothing remained, stopping only when they reached the daily amount he usually drank. They then threw it into a fierce fire, where it split into several pieces. From that point on, the scholar could no longer tolerate alcohol.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p>In &quot;Records of Qi and Harmony,&quot; it is said that in Long&#39;an County, Anlu Prefecture, there were three brothers named Guo Tan. The eldest brother, after contracting the celestial illness, was able to eat greatly; in one day, he consumed an entire dou of rice. His family suffered from poverty for five years, and eventually, he had to beg for food. One day, he reached a house where he had already received rice at the front door but then went around to the back to beg again. </p>
<p>The family, angry, said, &quot;You’ve already received food at the front; how can we give you more at the back?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am extremely hungry and truly did not realize it was the back door.&quot; In the garden, there were three beds of garlic leeks, and he ate two of them on the spot. Soon, he lay down on the ground in distress and vomited something resembling a dragon. As it came out, it gradually shrunk in size. When people brought him rice, he no longer wanted to eat. They placed the rice on the thing he had vomited, which quickly turned into water, and this illness was soon cured.</p>
<p><strong>A Woman with a Strange Illness</strong></p>
<p>There was a woman who suffered from a peculiar ailment: whenever her abdomen swelled, there would be a sound inside her like a drum, audible from outside. Those who passed by her door would often suspect that her family was celebrating. When the swelling in her abdomen went down, the drum sound would cease. This happened once a month for an entire year, and despite consulting a hundred doctors, no one could diagnose her condition.</p>
<p><strong>The Bell Sound in the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>There was a pregnant woman whose abdomen sounded like a bell. A poor scholar ground earth from a rat&#39;s burrow into powder and mixed it with two qian of musk broth. After taking this mixture, her ailment was cured.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

Your illness is recorded in the &quot;Suwen&quot; as &quot;food hanging.&quot; The human lungs are made up of six lobes, which expand and cover the spleen. When the maternal and child energies are in harmony, one can eat. If any disturbance occurs, the lungs cannot expand, leading to spleen dysfunction and lack of appetite. A prescription was provided to clear the energy and moisten the lungs. After three days of treatment, the patient smelled the aroma of meat and found it delicious. This was recorded by a Song dynasty writer, but upon review of the &quot;Suwen,&quot; no such ailment as &quot;food hanging&quot; is mentioned, suggesting a misattribution by the journalist.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p>

Although she recovered, her eyes remained wide open and could not close. No one could understand the issue, so they asked Qian Zhongyang who diagnosed it as a gall bladder disorder. He advised them to brew a drink with the kernels of the (mu yu) plum and give it to her until she became intoxicated, which would cure her. The reason for this is that the eyes are internally connected to the liver and gall bladder, and fear causes energy to become stagnant, preventing the gall bladder from descending. The (mu yu) plum kernels can alleviate the stagnation, entering the gall bladder along with the wine, allowing the stagnation to be relieved so that the eyes can then close. The treatment worked as described.</p>

<p>The Nine Worms</p>
<p>When there are corpse worms in a woman&#39;s abdomen, they are born with the individual and can cause severe harm. The corpse worm resembles a large horse tail or thin tendons, residing in the spleen, with a front and rear, each about three inches long. There are also nine kinds of worms: </p>
<ol>
<li>The Fuzhong worm, four-tenths of a foot long; </li>
<li>The Ascaris, one foot long; </li>
<li>The White worm, one inch long; </li>
<li>The Flesh worm, resembling a rotten apricot; </li>
<li>The Lung worm, resembling a silkworm; </li>
<li>The Stomach worm, resembling a frog; </li>
<li>The Weak worm, resembling melon seeds; </li>
<li>The Red worm, resembling raw meat; </li>
<li>The Pin worm, very small, resembling a caterpillar.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fuzhong worm is the leader among the worms; the Ascaris can penetrate the heart and kill; the White worm reproduces quickly, with many offspring, causing the mother to grow large, reaching four or five inches, also capable of causing death; the Flesh worm leads to discomfort; the Lung worm causes coughing; the Stomach worm induces vomiting, with upward gastric reflux; the Weak worm, also known as the diaphragm worm, causes excessive salivation; the Red worm leads to intestinal noises; the Pin worm resides in the intestines, and when numerous, can result in hemorrhoids, severe cases causing sores and scabs. </p>
<p>Tooth worms do everything harmful; individuals need not have them all, nor in abundance; some may have them, others may not, often women have many. These worms are ferocious and are a great affliction to humans. It is recommended to bathe with white yarrow, as both its roots and leaves are useful. Not only is it a fragrant herb, but it is also feared by the corpse worms.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, anyone wishing to take tonics or treat various diseases must first eliminate all parasites and phlegm and resolve lingering issues; only then can one take tonics, as otherwise the medicinal effects will not be achieved. </p>
<p>For those suffering from cold damage or epidemic fever, if there is heat in the abdomen and the person eats little, leading to emptiness in the stomach and intestines, the three parasites will seek food, eroding the five internal organs and lower parts. If there is no color around the gums, and the tongue is entirely white, in severe cases, there may be sores inside the lips, heaviness in the limbs, and an inclination to sleep. One should examine the inside of the upper lip for sores and spitting blood, and if there are sores inside the lower lip, this indicates that the parasites in the upper part erode the internal organs, while those in the lower part lead to excessive sleepiness—these parasites are often unnoticed. </p>
<p>One may take medicines to eradicate these parasites; otherwise, the hidden parasites can be deadly. Additionally, those suffering from moisture-related issues (with upper parasites hidden and lower parasites present) often have them arise after heat illness, prolonged diarrhea, or from external factors like warm, humid climates leading to such diseases. There may also be dry parasites, which do not manifest as diarrhea but can lead to sores and itching in the lower parts regardless of dry or wet conditions, ultimately becoming fatal if prolonged.</p>
<p>For moisture-related issues resulting in painful diarrhea, boiling medicinal herbs like Huang Lian, Ai Ye, and Ku Shen can be beneficial. If patients have no color around their gums, or a white tongue, experience excessive sleepiness and confusion, or have diarrhea, immediate attention to the lower parts is necessary. </p>
<p>Failure to recognize this will lead to treatments solely affecting the upper regions, neglecting the lower parts where worms may harm the anus, potentially resulting in ulceration that can cause death. Burning moxa in a bamboo tube for fumigation is advised.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Curing Methods</strong><br>(From &quot;The Essentials of the Matter&quot; by Xu Shuwei, Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>The heart worm is called &quot;hollow&quot;, the spleen worm is known as &quot;cui bai&quot;, the kidney worm resembles fine cut threads, the liver worm resembles rotten apricots, and the lung worm is akin to silkworms; all of these can be fatal. Among them, the lung worm is the most urgent, residing within the lung lobes and eroding the lung connections, thus causing tuberculosis. As a result, symptoms include coughing, spitting blood, and a hoarse voice, making treatment challenging as medicine often fails to reach it. </p>
<p>The &quot;Daoist Scriptures&quot; indicate that the heads of all worms point downward, but from the first day to the fifth day of the month, the heads point upward; thus, medications often yield better effects during this period. Additionally, Yao Kuan in &quot;West Creek Miscellaneous Talks&quot; states that all organ worms ascend, but only the lung worm descends, making it particularly difficult to treat. It is advised to grind otter claws into powder to mix with medicine and to treat on the fourth and sixth days, as on these days, the lung worm ascends. The two accounts differ slightly, but both may be retained for reference.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Nine Insects</strong></p>
<p>Insects arise from the accumulation of dampness and heat. Observing that there is rain during the day, one understands that the growth of crops leads to the emergence of insects; this principle is clear. Zhang Dairen aptly expounded on this: water and fire are associated with spring and summer, while damp earth pertains to late summer. Water transforms from the earth, hence there are many insects. Human suffering from insect accumulation primarily arises from imbalances in hunger and satiety, as well as improper regulation. This can happen from excessive consumption of fish, raw meat, and white wine, or mistakenly eating turtles and amaranth, leading to a deficiency in the central qi and disrupted pathway of damp heat, resulting in the emergence of various white worms, which may resemble earthworms or turtles. Children are most commonly affected, but adults can also suffer. Symptoms include heart palpitations, abdominal pain, vomiting frothy saliva, pale and yellowish complexion, dark circles under the eyes and around the nose, leading to reduced food intake, muscle weakness, lethargy, and mild chills or fever. If not treated early, the condition may worsen. The ancients said: if an insect grows to a foot long, it can harm a person. If they multiply rapidly, they can cause urgent harm. Treatment entails removing the insects by addressing the accumulation with remedies such as cutting red pills, Zun Shen pills, or Yu Xian pills.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

There may also be a lack of mental clarity, loss of the spirit, and heat in the five organs, along with the accumulation of residual toxins and stagnant blood. Consuming fruits and the internal organs of animals may leave behind certain types of worms. Symptoms of worms include nausea, vomiting foamy saliva, and intermittent pain that comes and goes. The small white worm is white and thin, depleting vital energy, causing weakness and back pain. The pinworm is as fine as a cabbage worm and can lead to conditions like hemorrhoids, sores, skin diseases, and abscesses. The small white worm, pinworm, and roundworm are among the nine types of worms. Additionally, there are children who suffer from malnutrition and restlessness, with rancid nasal discharge and ulcerations in the gums, resulting in dark blood in the stool. Worms affecting the lower part lead to external sores on the lower lip; those affecting the internal organs result in sores on the upper lip.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are nine types of parasitic worms, among which pinworms and ascarids cause many illnesses. Ascarids arise from consuming beef and drinking white wine; a length of one foot can be lethal. When treating with medicine, it is essential for the worms to be expelled completely, so that they come out wrapped together; only then is it effective. If the expulsion is incomplete, the worms will continue to proliferate, thus rapid treatment is necessary. Pinworms often affect children, but adults can also suffer from them. This condition causes heart pain, resulting in the expulsion of bile during a clear morning; agitation is also a symptom. Other types of worms are harmful as well, and since worms are present in everyone’s stomach, it is advisable to take the Nine Worm Pill to eliminate them.</p>
<p>The ascarid is one of these nine worms, typically measuring one foot in length, though some may be five to six inches long. They may become active due to a weakness in the organs or from consuming rich foods. Their activity causes abdominal pain, which can manifest as aggregations that shift up and down, producing intermittent pain. It can also lead to heart pain, heat in the abdomen, an increase in saliva, and the vomiting of clear water; if it severely injures the heart, it can lead to death. When diagnosing, if the pulse indicates abdominal pain, the pulse should ideally be weak and thin, but if it is strong and large, it indicates the presence of ascarids.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The intestinal parasite, known as the &quot;nine worms,&quot; exists in everyone’s abdomen. When a young child loses milk too early or consumes too many sweets, it can lead to a weak stomach and the movement of these worms, causing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting of clear fluids. If there are visible blue veins on the abdomen, it is effective to prepare the decoction by roasting the historical gentleman and using the shell. However, many people tend to take it before sleeping, without observing the proper timing, and thus do not find it effective. The correct approach is to take it between the fourth and fifth days of the lunar month during the fifth watch, in order to expel the worms completely by noon of that same day. Following this, one may use a warming and balancing medicine for one or two days to regulate the stomach, but not excessively. The nine worms in the abdomen orient themselves according to the lunar phases: in the first ten days of the month, they point upwards; in the middle ten days, they lie horizontally; and in the last ten days, they point downwards. Therefore, medicines taken in the middle or last ten days do not enter the worm&#39;s mouth, hence their ineffectiveness. The same principle applies to the offspring of cattle and horses: those born in the first ten days stay ahead of the mother; those born in the middle ten days walk side by side; and those born in the last ten days follow behind. Cats eat mice in a similar manner: they consume the front segment in the first ten days, the middle in the middle ten days, and the rear segment in the last ten days. This is the natural order of things, yet few recognize it.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Insects&#39; Disease</strong></p>
<p>Insects as a disease are prevalent among many people, stemming from transformation and birth, which is indeed hard to predict. In ancient medical texts, it is said that they arise from dampness, heat, indiscretions in eating and drinking, or the accumulation of food and drink. While these causes certainly exist, from common observations, it is found that those with strong organs and vigorous energy rarely have insects, as their food transforms quickly, making it difficult for insects to survive. Conversely, those with weak organ energy and sluggish transformation tend to have stagnation and consequently develop insects over time. Therefore, insects can arise from damp heat, raw or cold foods, rich and sweet foods, or from clogs and grease; it is not solely damp heat. Nonetheless, among these causes, raw and cold foods are the most likely to produce insects.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just like storing various items, if they are placed in damp conditions or near moisture, they are most easily damaged and rotted; is this not the truth? Therefore, for anyone wanting to care for infants, it is essential to limit their fruit intake to prevent damage to their spleen, which is indeed one of the most crucial points. As for methods to treat parasites, although one should eliminate the parasites, it is equally important to address the underlying cause to prevent their recurrence. One must focus on nurturing the original energy of the spleen and kidneys, ensuring that the internal energy is strong; if this is achieved, not only will the parasites not survive, but they also cannot form in the first place. I have a prescription for warming the internal organs, which is most suitable.</p>
<p>Parasites manifest a variety of ailments; their occurrence may gradually worsen, or increase from few to many. When they become longstanding, they can cause abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and eventually lead to emaciation and danger. Symptoms associated with parasite pain are irregular; they may come and go unpredictably, involve vomiting of greenish-yellow water, or even expulsion of parasites. Pain may lead to restless sitting or lying down, severe pain that is unbearable, and changes in facial complexion, which may appear blue, yellow, or white, while the lips remain red. If the pain settles and the person can still eat and drink, this indicates a buildup of parasites, and it is crucial to expel them promptly.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Regarding remedies for insects, when the insect&#39;s strength is immediate and causes pain in the abdomen, one should use the &quot;Sweep the Insects Decoction&quot; to treat the symptoms first. If the insects are firmly accumulated, one should use pills like &quot;Hunting Insect Pill,&quot; &quot;Encounter Immortal Pill,&quot; &quot;Wood Fragrance Betel Nut Pill,&quot; or &quot;Hundred Smooth Pills&quot; to address the issue. If the condition is somewhat milder and the substance is weaker, remedies like &quot;Epilobium Powder&quot; or &quot;Transform Insect Powder&quot; should be used. Danxi mentions that effective insect treatments use the root of the Chinese toon tree, betel nut, and crane louse, taking the juice in summer and making a strong decoction in winter. Moreover, the &quot;Universal Response Pill&quot; is particularly excellent.</p>
<p>In terms of methods for treating insects, according to Danxi, it&#39;s easier to treat when the insect&#39;s head is facing upward in the first half of the month; however, it becomes difficult when the head is facing downward in the latter half. One should first draw the insect&#39;s head upward with meat juice or syrup, then apply the medicine, as this is a wise strategy. Yet, this is a method for slower treatment. If the insect condition is very urgent, how can one afford to wait for the right timing? Moreover, to distinguish the direction of the insect&#39;s head by looking forward and backward is rather vague and lacks evidence. Only by using fragrant bait can one attract the insect&#39;s head; is it not true that there is also a method for treating it by looking backward? Why worry about difficulties in treatment?</p>
<p>Xu Donggao states that there are indeed many remedies for treating insects, but those who use them may not understand the methods and thus cannot eliminate the insects. As Danxi said, when insects wish to go downward, one must wait for them to face upward, and the methods should be employed before the middle of the month.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a worm finds food, it will not eat medicine, nor can it be expelled, leading merely to a drainage of its void. Therefore, even with a prescription, if one does not understand its method, the prescription will be ineffective. Whenever one wishes to expel worms, one must first refrain from eating for a day to make the worms hungry. Then, early at dawn, one should chew meat fried in oil for a long time, so that the worms in the abdomen smell the aroma of the meat, all turning upwards, desiring to eat. Then, take a chicken egg and mix it with the medicine to chew and consume it. Shortly after, drink scallion broth or plain water, a little bit at a time to assist the medicine’s downward action. Without exceeding the time, all the worms will be expelled, sometimes by the volume of several sheng. Then, replenish with plain porridge, continuously taking restorative agents to adjust the spleen and stomach, and the illness can be entirely cured.</p>
<p>An example of this treatment method: Once, a person suffered from severe abdominal pain, sometimes ceasing and sometimes intensifying, unbearable to endure. Although various medicines to remove accumulation and regulate qi were used, none were effective. At the site of the pain, one must strike it with a fist, causing the pain to lessen for a while, but it would soon return, leading to prolonged suffering without understanding the cause. Suddenly, a monk appeared and said: &quot;I can treat this.&quot; The patient was then instructed to first eat fragrant bait, followed by a pill, which expelled a strange, hard-mouthed worm, resulting in recovery. This was due to the worm gnawing at the intestines, causing extreme pain; striking it would vibrate the inner organs, making the worm afraid and retreat. If not struck, the worm would roam freely, hence the pain would reoccur. This is verification of the unique method for dealing with worms. Thus, whenever one observes symptoms of abdominal pain, if pressing or kneading temporarily alleviates the pain, it is often due to the presence of worms.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

<p>Among all worms, the roundworm is the most numerous. The methods to expel it are as previously mentioned. However, it can grow back as quickly as it is expelled, which is ultimately not a good strategy. To eliminate it at the source, one must strengthen the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are strong, the worms will not arise. Therefore, whether after expelling the worms or before, if one wishes to replenish the spleen and stomach, decoctions like Gui Pi Tang, Wen Wei Yin, Wu Jun Zi Jian, Li Zhong Tang, or the remedy for nourishing Yin are suitable. If one seeks to treat the worms at the same time, the best method is the Wen Zang Wan. The methods for treating worms can be either aggressive or nurturing, and one should attend to the appropriate timing and order; careful discernment is necessary and should not be neglected casually. Cao&#39;s &quot;Sources of Illness&quot; states: For abdominal pain, if the pulse is sinking and weak, it indicates something else, but if the pulse is surging and large, it signifies roundworms.</p>

<p>Children&#39;s worm ailments</p>
<p>The children&#39;s worm ailment, known as &quot;gan&quot; (upper hidden lower worm), is caused by excessive harm from food intake, leading to accumulation of &quot;gan&quot;. Symptoms include body heat, a bloated abdomen, a yellowish face, weakness in the limbs, lethargy, a foul-smelling nasal discharge, and sores on the gums. There may be diarrhea with black blood, all due to worms in the abdomen. It is advisable to use formulas such as Nine Flavors Aloe Pill, Chasing Worm Pill, Four Flavor Nourishing Child Pill, Seven Flavor Nourishing Child Pill, and Toad Pills for treatment. After the worms are expelled, one should continue to tonify qi and blood.</p>
<p>Insect pain</p>
<p>The symptom of insect pain is that eating reduces the pain, while not eating increases it.

The prescription includes two liang of white atractylodes, one liang each of tree root and white smartweed, three qian each of coptis, dried plum core, fried evodia, gardenia, poria, licorice, and turtle shell, all ground to powder and mixed with honey to form pills the size of millet. These should be administered when the person is hungry and craving food. After taking these pills, the pain will surely be intense; do not give them water immediately, as water helps the worms thrive. The brilliance of this formula lies in its ability to strengthen the spleen while using ingredients to kill the worms.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Since it is a medicine for killing insects, why must we wait until they are hungry to begin the extermination? When there is no food in the stomach, the insects cannot be nourished; their mouths will naturally turn upward to seek food. When they are hungry and empty, their heads will point upward, not downward. If food is given to them, they will certainly think it is food and all rush to compete for it. But when the mouth contradicts their nature, they will stir and jump, causing greater pain. If water is forbidden, then every part of their body—ears, eyes, mouth, and nose—will be contaminated by the medicinal vapor, attacking from within and without, leading only to death. If one does not know this restriction and still gives them water, the insects will take advantage and thrash about, bathing; with more water than medicine, they will naturally break apart, killing only half of them and not uprooting the grass. Therefore, one must endure a moment of pain to eliminate the lifelong suffering. I hope people can endure it! Also, a dose of three qian of rhubarb can be added; it can also be omitted. If there is pain above the abdomen, it is not suitable to increase the dosage; if there is pain below the abdomen, it should be increased.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Divine Efficacy Red Pill specially targets all forms of parasitic accumulation, showing unparalleled effectiveness. It should be taken at the break of dawn when the rooster crows, using cold tea for consumption. Additionally, one should collect excrement in a chamber pot and observe it in an open field to easily identify the effects of the medicine, whether it be parasites or accumulated matter, which may resemble rotten fish or various colored accumulations. If no parasites or accumulations are seen after the first attempt, one should check again a second or third time; this indicates the root of the illness. The accumulation will dissolve, the qi will disperse, the parasites will be expelled, and lumps will diminish. If the root of the illness is removed, the ailment will resolve itself. If the condition is mild, a single dose will show results. However, if the source is deeply rooted, a second dose may be necessary, which can clear seasonal accumulations. In spring, it resolves stagnant accumulation, preventing sores and toxins; in summer, it dispels summer heat and dampness, preventing heat-related issues; in autumn, it disperses phlegm and fluids, preventing pestilence; and in winter, it expels wind and cold, preventing epidemics. This medicine is gentle and does not disturb the true qi of the body, nor does it have adverse effects. It is not suitable for children to take fully or for pregnant women to use. Its effects are miraculous. </p>

<p>Another formula: Grind hemp to extract five liters of juice and divide into five doses. It also treats children&#39;s roundworms. </p>
<p>Another formula: Cut three liters of white mulberry root skin, boil with seven liters of water to extract two liters, fast overnight, and take on an empty stomach at dawn.</p>
<p>Another formula: Take 27 betel nuts, treat for diarrhea with two and a half liters of water. First boil the skin to extract one and a half liters, remove the dregs, and take frequently while keeping warm. If worms come out or are not fully expelled, continue to take until cured. Do not eat overnight; take in the morning.</p>
<p>For sores in the lower part: A thick decoction of peach skin resembling syrup can be applied to the lower part; for sores in the mouth, hold it in.</p>
<p>For dampness (concealing lower worms): Take fresh ginger, peel, and finely chop and grind to extract one and a half liters of juice, then mix with one and a half liters of water and take on an empty stomach at dawn. Also, peel two pieces of fresh ginger, about the size of cocoons, and wrap them multiple times in catalpa leaves and bitter peach leaves, then burn them in hot ash until extremely hot, and take them in the lower part of the body shortly after. If dampness is severe, repeat every three days until it is cured.</p>
<p>Another formula: Burn horseshoe ash to a powder, mix with pig fat, and apply in the lower part four to five times a day.</p>
<p>For itching from large hole worms: Steam large dates to extract their paste, mix with mercury to form a three-inch long strip, wrap in cotton, and insert into the large hole overnight; the worms will all come out by the next morning. However, mercury can harm the intestines, so caution is advised.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment for Intestinal Worms:</strong> Take the root of the bitter neem tree that hasn&#39;t been uprooted, peel off the skin, and take two taels of the inner white bark. Boil it in three bowls of water until only one and a half bowls remain, then strain it. On an empty stomach, first chew a piece of roasted meat to direct the worms upwards, then consume one or two mouthfuls of the medicinal porridge made from three cups of rice, and gradually increase to one bowl. This will ensure the worms descend completely and the patient recovers.</p>
<p><strong>For Febrile Illness with Sleepiness:</strong> If there is excessive sleep leading to dampness (with the worms hidden above and below), accompanied by pain in the limbs and inability to eat, prepare ten pounds of warm peach fruit. Cut and mash it until cooked, then soak it in three dou of warm water. At noon, have the patient sit down and consume the preparation for three times. This will lead to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>For Treating Hot Illness with Worm Toxins:</strong> If the patient feels lethargic and is unaware of the painful area, and displays a ruddy complexion like being drunk, with diarrhea of pus and blood, one should closely examine the size of the openings at the lower part of the body. If they are faintly red, it indicates sores with worms hiding above and below, which may be life-threatening. The affliction can penetrate the liver and lungs, and if treated with medicine does not heal, one can perform fumigation. </p>
<p>Make a small clay jar capable of holding one liter, and use a bamboo tube, as thick as a finger, to connect one end into the jar and the other end shallowly into the oral cavity. Burn mugwort that is about the size of an egg inside the jar, blowing the smoke into the person&#39;s abdomen. Continue until the mugwort is consumed. Adults may use more mugwort; for children, use less. Those who are weak should not use much, as it may harm them. It should be done twice a day, but no more than three times. The worms will die and be expelled. Alternatively, one can burn realgar powder and use it for fumigation in the same way.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method for Treating Roundworms:</strong> Take two sets of silkworm pupae and crush them thoroughly. Strain the juice through a cloth and consume it on an empty stomach. If silkworms are unavailable, you must collect the pupae in due time, drying them to a fine powder. Use this powder, in appropriate amounts as per your discretion, mixed with congee and take it.</p>
<p><strong>For Small White Worms:</strong> Use forty-nine Chinese Torreya nuts, remove the skin, and take seven on an empty stomach at dawn during the first ten days of the lunar month. Consume all in seven days; the worms will dissolve into water and be eliminated permanently. Alternatively, consuming all seven at once for a full week will transform the worms into water. In another method, take one hundred nuts and burn them to eat them entirely; this is best. If unable, just eat fifty, and the worms will pass by morning. This also treats the three corpse worms. </p>
<p><strong>Another Method:</strong> Use four grams of black lead ash, stir-fried for one dose. First, eat a small amount of pork jerky, then take half a cup of diluted sugar water mixed with the ash at dawn. The worms will be expelled, and consuming white congee for a day afterward is beneficial. During the Xuande era, I often felt an unsettling commotion in my heart, suspecting it was caused by drinking or possibly by worms. Following the prescribed treatments, I expelled two worms the next day, one measuring two and a half feet, with a broad head and sharp tail, segmented like a pattern, and it was completely fragmented.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states: in the intestines, there are parasitic insects, such as tapeworms and roundworms, which cannot be treated with small needles. For pain in the heart and intestines, with paroxysmal pain, swelling that alternates in direction, pain that has breaks, abdominal heat, a preference for thirst, and saliva production—this indicates the presence of tapeworms or roundworms. By pressing firmly with the hand and holding it in place, preventing any movement, one can then use a large needle to puncture it and hold it for a long time. When the insect does not move, only then remove the needle. This approach also addresses heart and abdominal pain, particularly in the upper body. </p>
<p>Emperor Huang asked: What energy causes a person to produce saliva? Qibo replied: All food and drink enter the stomach; if there is heat in the stomach, then insects are activated. When insects are activated, the stomach relaxes; when the stomach relaxes, the channels are opened, resulting in saliva production, thus supplementing the lesser yin.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the residence of the military officer Mao Jing, appointed to Yongzhou, he suffered from a peculiar ailment where every time he spoke, there was a corresponding sound in his throat. A Daoist taught him to recite the names of herbs. When he reached the term for &quot;blue,&quot; he fell silent. Then he took juice from seven blue plants and drank it; shortly after, he vomited out chunks of flesh measuring over an inch long, distinctly human in form. After that, he no longer had the odd sound.</p>
<p>In another instance, Yang Nian, who had an unusual ailment, would have a small sound in his belly every time he responded during conversations. Over the years, this sound grew louder. A Daoist, upon seeing him, exclaimed that it was a &quot;responsive bug.&quot; After a long time without treatment, it even affected his wife and children. It was advisable to read the herb texts and to take medicine when encountering a bug that didn&#39;t respond. Yang followed this advice and read until he reached the entry for &quot;thunder pill.&quot; When the bug was silent, he took the herb and was cured. Later, after arriving in Changsha, he met a beggar who had a similar ailment. Yang observed him closely and suggested taking the thunder pill, and the beggar was also cured.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Ding Zhi,&quot; in Qizhou, a scholar named Zhang Bin was invited by a local official to stay at his residence. Bin had a fondness for alcohol and would place several liters at the corner of his bed every night. One night, he forgot to prepare it, and at midnight, feeling very thirsty, he searched for it but couldn&#39;t find it. Furious and restless, he began to shout. Shortly thereafter, he vomited something onto the ground. In the morning, upon inspection, he saw pieces of flesh under the bed, yellow like liver and resembling a honeycomb, still slightly moving. He poured alcohol over it, and it made a chirping sound. He suddenly realized this was the root cause of his lifelong drinking problem, quickly threw it into the fire, and thereafter no longer drank.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In &quot;Geng Zhi,&quot; it is recorded that Zhao Zi, styled Jing Gao, resided in Tianwang Temple in Shaowu County. He suffered from the torment of a tiny white worm. The doctor advised him to stop drinking wine, but he was unable to resist his craving for it. One evening, after getting drunk outside, he returned home past midnight, feeling thirsty and dry in the throat, and hurriedly had no tea or drink. By chance, there was a jar of water under the corridor, shimmering beautifully in the moonlight. He scooped it up and drank, finding it as sweet as honey. After drinking several mouthfuls, he went to bed. When dawn broke, the worms emerged in abundance from his body, and he felt a sudden relief in his stomach, leading to his illness being cured. His family was astonished and examined the reason; it turned out that the temple servant daily wove straw shoes, soaking them in water from red vine roots.</p>
<p>Wang Shaoshi, while outside the barrier of the pass, fell ill and over several months his flesh and muscles wasted away. Every day he struggled to swallow food, but soon his abdomen felt as if thousands of worms were attacking, both itching and painful, and he was thought to be suffering from exhaustion and a wasting disease. At that time, Zhang Rui was in Chengdu, and Wang sent a courier to summon him. When Rui arrived in Xingyuan, he took Wang&#39;s pulse and advised him to endure hunger tomorrow morning and refrain from eating anything while waiting for Rui to make a plan. The next morning, it was scorching hot. Wang asked one of his strong servants to go ten miles away to fetch a silver bowl of yellow soil from the road, instructing the cook to prepare noodles for lunch. Only when it was noon did they manage to eat, just as the soil was delivered. Then, he warmed a liter of wine, mixed the soil into it, and provided Wang with a hundred pills to drink. Wang felt a painful tug in his intestines and was nearly unable to bear it, urgently needing to relieve himself. Rui secretly instructed to prepare another hole for this purpose, and promptly urged Wang to go there.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<p>He began to believe that last year, when he marched out on a summer night, he became parched and thirsty on the way. He ordered the soldiers to bring a horse trough to draw water from the stream.

It was said that the worm only showed itself three days before the new moon, with its head facing upwards; it could be attacked with medicine during that time. After that, on the remaining days, its head would turn downwards, and any medicine would be ineffective. The worm was attracted to the aroma of the meat, which made it swarm eagerly, leading to a sensation in the chest as if wounded by thousands of arrows; that was the signal to drink the medicine. Cai followed the instructions closely. Within moments, his stomach rumbled violently, and he rushed to the toilet; the worms fell out like pouring water.
