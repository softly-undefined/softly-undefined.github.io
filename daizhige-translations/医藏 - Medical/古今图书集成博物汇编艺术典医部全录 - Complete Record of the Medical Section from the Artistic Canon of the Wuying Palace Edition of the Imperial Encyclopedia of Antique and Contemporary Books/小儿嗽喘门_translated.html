<p>Section on Cough and Wheezing in Children</p>
<pre><code>        Huangdi&#39;s Classic of Pure Questions<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Critique of the Theory of Reality and Emptiness</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: When a child has wind-heat with wheezing and shoulder breathlessness, what is the pulse like? Qi Bo replied: In cases of wheezing and shoulder breathlessness, the pulse is firm and large. When it is slow, life arises; when it is rapid, death ensues. [Note: This further discusses the acquired vital energy produced postnatally, which should also not be harmed. The vital energy is the foundation originating from the five organs, six viscera, and twelve meridians, hence called vital energy. Shoulder breathlessness indicates breathing that shakes the shoulders. Wind-heat harm initially affects the skin and hair. Wheezing and shoulder breathlessness indicate that excessive wind-heat has dried up the lung&#39;s vital energy, resulting in a firm and large pulse. The pulse&#39;s harmony and slowness derive from the stomach&#39;s yang energy. If rapid, the stomach’s essence is lost, thus leading to death.]</p>
<p><strong>Pediatrics of Direct Instructions</strong> [Song Dynasty, Qian Yi]</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Coughing with Variable Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Coughing indicates a slight cold in the lungs. During the months of August and September, when lung energy is robust, if one coughs with a flushed face and has abundant phlegm and body heat, it is appropriate to use Ting Li Pill to address it; if it has been a long-term ailment, it should not be purged. In November and December, coughing indicates a cold-induced cough. The wind enters through the pulmonary back shu point at the third vertebra and should be treated with Ma Huang Decoction to induce sweating. If there are signs of heat with a flushed face and difficulty swallowing water, it should be treated in combination with Gan Ju Decoction. If during May and July there is significant body heat and dry expectoration, use Bian Yin Pill; if there is no heat but only coughing, use Ting Li Pill primarily, followed by phlegm-resolving medication. If one coughs and then wheezes with facial swelling, it indicates excessive lung fire, which should be countered with Xie Bai San to clear it.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Coughing and being unable to breathe, with sounds in the throat, or after a prolonged cough leading to depleted lung fluids, indicates lung deficiency, which should be treated with Ejiao powder. If phlegm is excessive, first strengthen the spleen, then use Bianyin pills in small doses; once salivation decreases, then supplement the lungs.</p>
<p>For those coughing up greenish fluid, use Baixiang pills; for coughing up phlegm mixed with milk or food, use Baipingzi; for coughing up pus and blood, use Ganju soup; for coughing with thick phlegm and a red face after drinking water, use Bianyin pills. Treat initial coughing with purgatives, and for prolonged cases, use tonics, adjusting based on the balance of deficiency and excess.</p>
<p>(Note: In the previous diagnosis, a child may have weak skin barriers, allowing external pathogens to invade, or may be affected by the rich foods of a wet nurse. For external wind attacks, use Mahuang decoction; for internal heat accumulation, use Tingli pills to soothe. If experiencing a runny nose or headache with a heavy sensation, use Shengsudrink, and additionally use Si Junzi to strengthen lung qi.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If the heart fire harms the lungs, use ginseng to clear the lungs and a formula to nourish the kidney water; if there is cough with greenish phlegm, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chaihu and Jie Geng to soothe the liver and replenish the spleen; if there is cough with milky phlegm, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Jie Geng to tonify the earth and generate metal; if there is cough with purulent blood, use Jie Geng Decoction to expel pus and strengthen the lungs. Mr. Jie Gu said: if there is cough with pain in both sides, it indicates liver fire invading the lungs, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction. If there is cough with bitter water vomiting, it indicates bile overflow, use Huangqin Banxia Shengjiang Decoction. If there is cough with a blockage in the throat, it indicates heart fire injuring metal, use Gan Jie Decoction. If there is cough with shortness of breath, it indicates disregard of the small intestine, use Shaoyao Gancao Decoction. If there is cough with wheezing, it indicates wind evil harming the lungs, use Ma Huang Decoction. If there is cough with vomiting long worms, it indicates gastric qi deficiency, use Wumei Pill. If there is cough with excessive phlegm, it indicates wind harming the spleen, use Shengma Decoction. If there is cough with incontinence, it indicates large intestine qi deficiency, use Chishi Zhi Yuyuliang Decoction; if it does not stop, use Zhuling Decoction.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Coughing with back pain indicates that the wind pathogen has harmed the kidneys; use the Mahuang, Fuzhu, and Xixin Decoction. If coughing is accompanied by urinary incontinence, it suggests bladder qi deficiency; use the Fuling and Gancao Decoction. If there is abdominal fullness, facial swelling, and lack of appetite, it indicates spleen deficiency with qi counterflow; use the Wuwei Yigong Powder. </p>
<p>Danxi said: Coughing in the morning indicates heat in the stomach; coughing at dusk indicates deficiency of spleen and lung qi; coughing in the afternoon indicates kidney Yin fire. Generally, cough syndromes arise from lung qi deficiency, where the pores are not tight, allowing external pathogens to invade. If wind invades the protective layer, it causes difficulty in exhaling, and if heat reaches the nourishing level, it prevents inhalation. The clash of wind and heat causes stagnation of blood and qi in the lungs. A rapid but weak pulse at the cun indicates lung atrophy; a rapid but strong pulse indicates lung abscess. These conditions result from excessive sweating leading to depletion of body fluids. The Mahuang Decoction is a remedy for inducing sweating and resolving the exterior, while the Tingli Pill is used for internal smoothing and draining. The Baipingzi also serves as a draining agent, and these should only be used if the symptoms correspond. If indiscriminately administered, it will lead to a serious depletion of body fluids and result in a failed condition.</p>
<p>Cough with phlegm due to wind-heat in children can be treated with Tongsheng Jia Banxia, taking it in small doses over three to five days for resolution.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Asthma</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of symptoms, both related to phlegm and heat. Some may occur abruptly after exposure to wind and cold, while others may arise from the consumption of salty or acidic foods and beverages. Therefore, when the Yang is strong, the illness manifests and persists without end. For mild cases, a single dose of Wuhutang can suffice to stop it; for severe cases, the use of Tingli Wan is advisable, which is effective for immediate relief. If one desires to eradicate the root cause, internal use of Wusheng Dan and external application of moxibustion is recommended, targeting the heart point on the left back and the Zusanli point, each to be moxibusted three times. Additionally, avoidance of sour, salty, spicy, and hot foods is required. </p>
<p>Asthma often becomes a chronic condition, especially when the sky is overcast and rain is imminent, and treatment should focus on releasing the exterior and promoting phlegm elimination. Jiubao is often effective in such cases. If the exterior pathogen has not been eliminated, start with Wuhutang, and for internal fullness, prioritize Tingli Wan. It is unsuitable to use arsenic to form pills, as it can endanger the children&#39;s lives.</p>
<p><strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>There are three treatment methods: one for inducing sweating, one for promoting diarrhea, and one for clearing and tonifying. For initial onset with wind-cold exposure, mild cases can be treated with Su Chen Jiubao Tang, while severe cases may require Wuhutang, which acts swiftly. If a cough persists accompanied by fever and difficult breathing, it indicates a lurking fire in the lungs, treat it with Tingli Wan to ease symptoms. If the cough persists with lung deficiency, leading to continuous symptoms, tonifying the lungs is necessary, primarily using Ejiao Wan. If the cough is prolonged with incessant sounds, and there is bleeding from the mouth and nose, the treatment should focus on Maogen Tang, which is remarkably effective. If coughing occurs in summer, it should be treated with Jiawei Baihutang, and sweating or purging should be avoided. For severe cough and asthma, use Lìtān Wán as the main remedy.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If one coughs and vomits, treat with Er Chen Decoction plus ginger juice. If the cough persists and leads to a hard chest (guijin), treat with Ting Li Pill. If there is cough, throat pain, and a hoarse voice, use Gan Ju Decoction for treatment. Traditionally, for treating a cough, only Yu Ye Wan is used, taken with fine tea broth. </p>
<p>For chronic cough, where the complexion is pale, the eyes lack luster, breathing is difficult with phlegm congestion, and a relentless cough lasts day and night, the person is weak and overheated, and should not be treated. If the face is bluish and shiny, with wheezing and tightness, and the lips are often white like wax, this indicates strong liver energy and exhausted lung energy, and should not be treated. </p>
<p>If there is pronounced chest tightness, wheezing, shoulder movement, and further signs of shock, do not treat. During a time of tidal heat, if there is urgent coughing, a bluish-black face, bulging eyes, and blood comes from the mouth and nose, this indicates excess wood and fire energy and exhausted lung energy, and should not be treated. </p>
<p>If the face is white or bluish, with white lips, closed eyes, confused and restless, shaking hands and head, this indicates that the lungs are about to fail, and should not be treated. If there is phlegm in the throat and the voice is hoarse, do not treat; this applies to chronic cases.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The lungs are the canopy of the five organs; the skin and hair are susceptible to wind and cold. Initially, inducing sweating is of utmost importance, with ephedra and apricot kernels being effective. Grass fruit, yellow quinsy, and belvedere root, gypsum, mint, ginseng, and the combination of cocoon and bitter orange boiled together, can disperse wind and cold with one dose.</p>
<p>For a chronic cough, dispersing is not advisable; it is better to transform phlegm and smooth the qi. Moistening with jade fluid has miraculous effects, and if ineffective, herbal decoctions should be repeated. Fritillaria, dried tangerine peel, bitter orange, poria, sweet orange, yellow quinsy, and gardenia, along with mint and apricot kernels, are suitable if there is heat and gypsum can be helpful.</p>
<p>In cases of chronic cough with phlegm obstruction and fever, observe the urine and stools. If still clear and frequent, this indicates middle deficiency and can be handled as per the prescription from Baolong. However, if there are symptoms of fullness and heat due to a prolonged condition, it is necessary to differentiate between deficiency and excess without being overly concerned about this; it is essential for the infant&#39;s well-being.</p>
<p>For a chronic cough with blood in the sputum, clearing the heat from metal and lowering the fire is optimal. Yellow quinsy, gardenia, sweet stems, winter flowers, and know mother, as well as two winters, should be applied liberally.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Remove dried tangerine peel and bitter orange, add fangfeng, dibencao, and frost, along with poria, ginseng, and barley. This formula is priceless. </p>
<p>Generally, for the treatment of cough, it is essential to clear phlegm and sputum, and resolving phlegm and smoothing the qi should be prioritized. Smoothing the qi requires tangerine peel and bitter orange, while transforming phlegm involves pinellia and tian nanxing, with scutellaria and gardenia addressing fire evils. Platycodon and poria help to open and drain.</p>
<p>A persistent cough that won&#39;t stop, with a pale face and frequent sighs, high chest and wrinkled brows, sweating like pearls, a pale face, and blue lips, a bent back. The body is thin like a stick, experiencing tidal fevers, with a dry nose and weak spirit, hoarse voice that shocks and causes seizures, and even if there are miraculous pills, there is nowhere to apply them.</p>
<p>In cases of dry cough, often with heat, a yellowish face, shortness of breath, and lack of spirit, use angelica, tangerine peel, and white poria, along with gardenia, scutellaria, and platycodon. Knowing of fritillaria, fangfeng, and tianma, add licorice, bitter orange, and ginseng, and further include berberine, producing miraculous results, with fangfeng and ginger as a guide.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Infant Concerns: Breathing Difficulties</strong></p>
<p>It is discussed that children may experience wheezing due to various causes. Some might wheeze from fear or shock affecting their heart and lungs, leading to a deficiency of qi. Others may wheeze from a cold causing congestion in the lungs, or from a cough due to an external wind, resulting in lung deficiency. Additionally, consuming salty food could harm lung qi, causing phlegm and wheezing. Eating hot or toxic foods may agitate the body&#39;s three burners, accumulating heat and causing a reversal of lung and liver energy, which also results in wheezing. There are distinctions in severity between wheezing and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Wheezing manifests as an open mouth unable to speak, with a feeling of tightness in the chest and short, rapid breaths, leading to a sense of distress. For wheezing triggered by shock and acute lung distress, the major remedy is the &quot;Xiong Zhu Hua Tan Ding Chuan Wan&quot; combined with &quot;Tian Ma Ding Chuan Yin.&quot; For wheezing due to a cold with lung congestion, treatments such as &quot;Xiao Qing Long Tang,&quot; &quot;Ma Huang Xing Ren Gan Cao Shi Gao Tang&quot; are employed, differentiating between cold and heat for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>For wheezing caused by an external wind cough and lung deficiency, &quot;San Ao Tang&quot; is adjusted as necessary. If the wheezing is attributed to salty food, one can consume fresh tofu. If heat is present, treatment should involve cooling remedies for the lungs to settle wheezing. In cases of asthma, using Xu Shuzheng&#39;s sixteen methods for treating asthma has proven effective. </p>
<p>Additionally, if wheezing occurs after sweating or purging, remedies like &quot;Ge Gen,&quot; &quot;Huang Lian,&quot; and &quot;Huang Qin&quot; are indicated; in severe cases, &quot;Ting Li Zi&quot; is added. For pronounced wheezing, &quot;Ting Li Wan&quot; can ease tension and restore appetite, and &quot;Qian Jin She Gan Tang&quot; is highly effective for treating cough and wheezing emergencies.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Ho (Nasal Obstruction)</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Sacred Treatise&quot; discusses nasal obstruction, stating that the lung meridian is affected by wind and cold, resulting in cough and cold stagnating in the lungs, which leads to phlegm production. This causes the organs to become heated, disrupting restful sleep and leading to nasal obstruction, producing a sound similar to a saw when breathing through the throat. If a child exhibits this condition, they can take Tongguan Mei Hua Decoction, Banxia Pill, as well as Baoshou Powder, Xiaogui Ming Powder, and Jiejia Powder, with two or three doses for relief. If the nasal obstruction resembles a mass syndrome, and the throat sounds like a saw, it indicates the lung is affected by wind evil, causing rapid breathing, bluish complexion on the face and lips, and deep retraction under the neck, with phlegm sticky like glue and foul-smelling breath. Such cases are deemed untreatable.</p>
<p><strong>Asthma</strong></p>
<p>When asked about a child’s asthma, common belief is that it is caused by violating the earth, thought to be the Earth Deity. Some engage in activities such as grinding grain, cooking, or excavating wells and filling them, or opening drainage ditches, during which if a child has asthma, it is assumed they have undoubtedly violated the earth. Some follow practitioners to retreat the earth’s influence; others inscribe talismans to place on the disturbed ground; or employ spellbound water to burn the talismans for medicinal concoctions, or calculate the nine palaces of the home to determine where the Earth Deity resides, when the sun sets, and drink the earth from the sun&#39;s place, believing this can relieve the Earth Deity&#39;s affliction and ease the asthma. There have been instances where this has yielded positive results.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>In all the medical texts throughout the ages, there are countless volumes; why is this evidence not included, but only left to be treated by those of lower status? Please clarify this for me! </p>
<p>It is said that when a child experiences wheezing, it is often due to being constrained by wind and cold from the outside, which obstructs the pores and prevents the lung qi from circulating, causing illness. The treatment should use Qian&#39;s Xie Bai San or San Yao Tang and similar remedies to open the pores, allowing the lung qi to flow freely, thus easing the wheezing. </p>
<p>Sometimes this wheezing occurs after vomiting or diarrhea, leading to insufficient central qi, which also causes shortness of breath and wheezing. The treatment can involve Qian&#39;s Yi Huang San, Dong Yuan&#39;s Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, or even Fulong Gan steeped in warm water for consumption, which has been effective in stopping the wheezing. </p>
<p>When the spleen is greatly deficient, it must rely on the earth&#39;s qi for nourishment. Some practitioners, noticing this principle, craftily name and label it, claiming that the earth&#39;s qi of the sun can calm the earth. However, since children exhibit various symptoms—some may have convulsions and stare straight while wheezing, while others may have full lungs and rapid breathing—even if one takes the earth&#39;s qi from the sun and irrigates with it, it still cannot save one in a million cases.</p>
<p>Doctors should properly adjust and treat based on established formulas and methods, rather than being misled by the practices of lower-tier practitioners that could cause confusion!<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p>
<h3>Essentials for Childcare</h3>
<h4>Lungs</h4>
<p>Children have less developed skin pores, making them susceptible to external pathogens leading to lung diseases. For cases needing lung cleansing, use Qingfei Pills; if there is spleen and stomach qi deficiency causing lung issues, use Six Gentlemen Decoction; if there is spleen and stomach qi excess with bowel obstruction, use Xiehuang Powder; if heart fire is scorching lung metal, use Dihuang Pills. </p>
<h4>Coughs</h4>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: A cough indicates mild cold in the lungs, especially prevalent between August and September when lung qi is abundant. If there is a red face and body heat, the illness is substantial; in this case, administer Tingli Pills. For chronic coughs, do not use purgatives. In winter, if the cough is due to a cold, use Mahuang Decoction to induce sweating. If the face is red and there is difficulty drinking, coughing up purulent phlegm, and throat discomfort, use Ganju Decoction for clearing. If preceded by cough and followed by wheezing, with facial swelling and body heat, this shows strong lung qi; use Xie Bai Powder to balance it. For a cough with salivation of phlegm or milk, use Baipingzi to treat. Jie Gu states: If there is pain in both sides during a cough, it is related to the liver channel; use Xiao Chaihu Decoction. For coughing followed by vomiting of bitter water, it relates to the gallbladder channel; use Huangqin Banxia Shengjiang Decoction. For cough with obstruction in the throat, it pertains to the heart channel; use Ganju Decoction. A cough causing loss of breath relates to the small intestine; use Shaoyao Gancao Decoction. A cough with right-sided pain relates to the spleen channel; use Shengma Decoction. Coughing leading to vomiting of long worms relates to the stomach channel; use Wumei Pills. A cough with wheezing and coughing blood relates to the lung channel; use Mahuang Decoction.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Coughing accompanied by fecal incontinence is related to the large intestine, treated with a decoction of red stone resin. Coughing with pain in the lower back, and severe cases involving sputum, is linked to the kidney meridian, treated with a decoction of ephedra, prepared aconite, and dried ginger. Coughing with urinary incontinence relates to the bladder, treated with a decoction of poria and licorice. Coughing accompanied by abdominal fullness, loss of appetite, facial swelling, and reversed qi pertains to the three burners, treated with the modified Yigong powder. If there is coughing and a runny nose due to external pathogens harming the lungs, start with the ginseng and perilla drink. For wheezing with flushed face, indicating excess heart fire injuring the lungs, use ginseng to soothe the lungs powder, along with the six-ingredient earth essence pill. If coughing produces greenish sputum, indicating liver wood invading the spleen, use the Yigong powder with additional bupleurum and platycodon. If phlegm resembling milk is expelled, indicating spleen and lung qi deficiency, use the six gentlemen&#39;s decoction with added platycodon. For coughing with purulent sputum, indicating heat accumulation in the lungs resulting in lung abscess, use the platycodon decoction. Generally, for external wind pathogens causing harm, one should disperse the exterior and solidify the pores; if using purgatives, it must not be due to internal transmission of pathogens or actual heat in the stomach, as this should not be taken lightly. A pale complexion and short, thin pulse are foundational for the lungs and are easy to treat; a red complexion with a surging, rapid pulse indicates fire injuring metal and is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>The condition of wheezing is often due to deficiency of both the spleen and lungs. When the protective layers are not dense, external pathogens can invade, leading to a situation where the true vital energy is weak and the pathogenic energy is strong. If the wheezing has already developed, the focus should be on dispelling the evil. If it has not yet developed, the focus should be on tonifying the spleen. If we simply attack the evil, it will damage the true vital energy, and if we directly tonify the lungs, it will only benefit the pathogenic energy. In any case of wheezing and coughing, if urination is not smooth, then there will surely be bloating. Bloating leads to wheezing, so it is essential to differentiate between the root (the fundamental cause) and the branch (the manifestation) in order. If wheezing occurs before bloating, the primary cause is in the lungs; if bloating occurs before wheezing, the primary cause lies with the spleen.</p>
<p>The Lung, belonging to the metal element, is responsible for descending energy, while its external aspect governs the skin and hair. The lungs connect to the hundred vessels, regulate the water pathways, and direct fluids to the bladder. If the lungs are invaded by pathogens, they lose the ability to descend and discharge, leading to increasingly reduced urination, which causes fluid to overflow into the skin and result in swelling. In this case, wheezing is the root and swelling is the branch; treatment should primarily focus on clearing metal and descending fire, with fluid regulation as a secondary concern.</p>
<p>The Spleen, associated with the earth element, dislikes dampness and governs the muscles. The earth element can control water, but if the spleen is impaired and cannot control fluids, water and dampness can behave erratically, soaking into the muscles. Once the fluid overflows, it can invade the lung qi, preventing it from descending and causing wheezing. Here, swelling is the root and wheezing is the branch; treatment should primarily focus on strengthening the spleen and regulating fluids, with clearing metal as a secondary concern. If drying herbs meant for the spleen are used for lung conditions, metal becomes dry and the wheezing worsens; conversely, using cooling herbs meant for metal in spleen conditions will cause cold in the spleen and exacerbate swelling.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>For those with symptoms of weak central qi, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction; if there is coldness in the central qi, add toasted ginger to the formula. For those with stagnant qi due to emotional distress, use the Gui Pi Decoction with added Bupleurum and Gardenia. If the liver wood overacts on the spleen earth, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Bupleurum and Gardenia. For lung qi stagnation, use the Perilla Decoction with Atractylodes. For food stagnation, use the Stomach Nourishing Decoction with Saussurea. If there is hidden heat in the lungs causing water to be unable to generate and leading to wheezing, use the Huang Qin Clear Lung Decoction and the Five Lin Powder. For weak spleen and lungs unable to regulate the waterways, use the Ren Shen Bai Du San and the Six Flavor Pill. For those with rich and thick food causing stagnation in spleen and lungs and resulting in wheezing, use the Clear Stomach Powder and the Kidney Nourishing Pill. When heart fire injures metal and cannot generate water, use the Ren Shen Ping Fei San and also the Kidney Nourishing Pill. For kidney water deficiency leading to virtual fire consuming metal, with difficulty in urination, use the Six Flavor Pill and the Additional Benefits of Qi Decoction. If the liver wood dominates spleen leading to wheezing, use the Six Gentlemen, Bupleurum, and Cimicifuga. For coldness in the spleen and stomach with abdominal distention, use the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill. For spleen and kidney cold deficiency unable to contain water leading to severe distension, use the Kidney Qi Pill with modifications.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>If there is a loss of the three Yin and it causes wheezing and distension, or if there is an irregularity in the two excretions, and pain from pulling occurs, all should be treated with modified Six-Flavor and Eight-Flavor Kidney Qi Pills. Additionally, consider the signs of wind-cold causing cough. </p>
<p>According to &quot;The Prescription for Life,&quot; wheezing indicates that the lung qi is abundant but, despite this abundance, one must recognize it as weak; excess should be seen as deficiency. An overabundance of lung qi signifies a prevalence of fire in the lungs; excess indicates lingering pathogens in the lungs. The pulse at the right inch will be floating and strong, with a red color in the right cheek. One should use Xie Bai San to purge it. </p>
<p>If the previous condition arises due to a lactating woman catching a cold wind, leading to heat accumulation in the lung meridian that harms the child, one should use Shen Su Drink; if the lactating woman has a buildup of heat from rich food and alcohol, affecting the child, one should use Qing Wei San.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>Newborn infants often experience coughing within the first hundred days of life, where their delicate lungs are particularly difficult to treat. Typically, when cold or pathogenic factors enter the lungs, they cannot expel them effectively and are unable to vomit or produce bowel movements. It is essential to identify the source of illness, clear away wind and cold, transform phlegm and smooth qi, nourish the lungs and generate fluids, open the stomach, and strengthen qi, leading to a gradual reduction of cough. Do not be overly aggressive in treatment! </p>
<p>Cold coughs are characterized by a runny nose with clear discharge, a pale face, thin phlegm, and symptoms worsening at night. Heat coughs manifest with a slightly reddened face, dry nose, thick and hot phlegm, and a rapid pulse. Gastric heat not due to wind and cold can cause irritability in infants, leading to cough and reverse flow of milk, which should be addressed with specific remedies. According to Qian’s method for treating cough, one should first strengthen the spleen; when the spleen is robust, the lungs will function harmoniously. </p>
<p>For infants with coughing, if the protective layers have been disturbed by wind and pathogens, resulting in a flushed face and rapid breathing, one must discern between deficiency and excess; signs such as thin lips, a sunken chest, and a dry, darkened nose indicate a poor prognosis.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The lungs are responsible for wheezing. </p>
<p>In cases of excess, there is a chaotic and rapid wheeze, with some drinking water and others not. In cases of deficiency, there is a prolonged gasp for air. </p>
<p>When lung disease manifests as chaos, prolonged gasping, and shortness of breath with a rapid inhale, if there is heat in the lungs, pressing on the brows, eyes, nose, and face is advised, and 甘桔汤 (Sweet Tangerine Decoction) is recommended. If there is an excess of lung heat accompanied by wind and cold, with fullness in the chest and shortness of breath, one should first disperse the lung, and then dispel wind and cold. For this, 润肺泻白散 (Moistening Lung and Draining White Powder) and 大青膏 (Da Qing Ointment) are indicated. If the lungs are solely affected by cold, there will not be fullness in the chest. </p>
<p>For lung deficiency with heat, the lips will have a deep red color; treatment involves dispersing the lung’s deficient heat and taking a small amount of 润肺泻白散. If the lungs are weak and the lips are pale, one should bolster the lungs, and 阿胶散 (Ejiao Powder) should be used. If there is confusion, coarse breath, and rapid wheezing, this is difficult to treat due to lung deficiency. </p>
<p>If the spleen and lung disease persists, they become deficient and the lips may turn white. The spleen is the mother of the lungs; when both are deficient, they cannot support each other, hence the term &#39;weak.&#39; The spleen governs the lips; if they are pale and moist, this is auspicious, but if they are as white as dry bone, it signifies death. </p>
<p>This is the method for diagnosing lung issues through the lips. Pale lips indicate a weak lung, to be treated with 阿胶散. If one finds themselves fiddling with collar and twisting objects, this indicates liver heat, and 青丸 (Qing Pill) should be used to drain it. Pressing on the brows, eyes, nose, and face indicates lung heat, suggesting treatments like 甘桔汤. </p>
<p>In spring, when the metal is strong, the lungs surpass the liver, and one should drain the lungs. If the condition is mild, the lung disease will recede, but if severe, the eyes become pale blue and are likely to shock; further redness may occur. As noted in 海藏: this represents liver weakness, resulting in pale blue eyes. </p>
<p>The lungs govern dryness; if the disease arises, it results in wheezing and coughing, hence dryness should be moistened.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>In reality, if there is wheezing and excess qi, the formula of Xie Bai San is indicated. If there is wheezing and diminished qi, first use the formula of Shen Yi Huang San, and then A Jiao San as the main treatment. </p>
<p>When the heart influences the lungs with evil heat, causing wheezing and coughing, start with Di Huang Wan, then use Zhong Dao Chi San, and follow with A Jiao San. </p>
<p>If the liver affects the lungs with a mild evil, causing aversion to wind, dizziness, and cough, Qiang Huo Gao is the main treatment. </p>
<p>If the kidneys affect the lungs with real evil, leading to aversion to cold and clear, draining cough, Bai Bu Wan is the main treatment. </p>
<p>If the spleen affects the lungs with a deficiency evil, bringing a heavy sensation, phlegm, and diarrhea, Ren Shen Bai Zhu San is the main treatment. </p>
<p>In general, when the lungs are ill, one must first observe the condition of the heart and spleen. If there is heart fire affecting the lungs, one should first suppress heart qi before addressing lung treatment. If heart qi is harmonious, one should look at the spleen pulse; if the spleen qi is deficient and cold, it cannot nourish the lungs properly, leading to vulnerability to wind evils, so those with lung cold often have spleen deficiency as the cause. If the spleen qi is strong and real, it may cause obstruction in the middle burner, making it difficult for the large intestine and lungs to communicate. When heat blocks the middle burner, the lungs and large intestine cannot connect, and the heat toxin will rise to the lungs, resulting in phlegm; thus, patients with lung heat often suffer due to spleen excess.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>For those with excessive heart energy, it should be reduced; for those with deficient spleen energy, it should be boosted; for those with full spleen energy, it should be regulated. Then, one should treat according to the cold and heat of the lungs, leading to three remedies: to suppress heart energy, to benefit spleen energy, and to regulate lung energy. If the pulse indicates that both the heart and spleen are balanced, but the lung has its own illness, one should then examine the deficiency or excess of the lungs and treat accordingly.</p>
<p>For lung channel heat and stagnation, use Bai San (White Powder); for lung energy deficiency, use Si Junzi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction); for invasion of external pathogens, use Shen Su Yin (Ginseng and Perilla Decoction); for lung fire and dryness, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San (Ginseng Lung-Smoothing Powder); for a full sensation in the middle jiao, use Da Chengqi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction); if the spleen cannot generate the lung energy, use Yi Gong San (Specific Function Powder). </p>
<p>In cases of excessive lung energy, there is an excess of pathogenic energy within the lungs; the pulse at the right cun will be floating and strong, indicating the use of Bai San to drain it. If the lung is deficient but there is heat, it is a mistake to not use ginseng, adhering to the saying that lung heat harms the lungs without recognizing the signs to treat.</p>
<p>If the lung is troubled by upward-reversed energy, quickly consume bitter foods to drain it, such as haritaki peel, or alternatively, huangqin (scutellaria). If the lung desires to gather, quickly eat sour foods to gather it, such as white peony root; to supplement with sour, use Schisandra fruit; to drain with pungent, use mulberry white peel. </p>
<p>If the lungs are deficient, supplement with Schisandra fruit; if there are no other symptoms, Qian’s Lu Fei Ejiao San (Qian&#39;s Lung-Supplementing Gelatin Powder) should be administered. In deficiency, one must supplement its mother, as the spleen is the mother of the lung, using licorice to nourish the spleen. </p>
<p>For full lung energy, drain it with mulberry white peel; if there are no other symptoms, prioritize Bai San for treatment. In excess, drain its child, as the kidney is the child of the lung, using Ze Xie to drain the kidney.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Coughing</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All organs can cause coughing, not just the lungs. The skin and hair are the dwelling places of the lungs. The skin and hair are the first to be affected by evil qi, which then invades from its dwelling. Cough from the five organs, if prolonged, will eventually affect the six bowels. Furthermore, the &quot;Key Points of Pathogenesis&quot; says: A cough is characterized by sound without phlegm, indicating a depletion of lung qi leading to unclear airflow; a &quot;sore throat&quot; refers to phlegm without sound, as dampness in the spleen stirs up phlegm; coughing and &quot;sore throat&quot; together involve both sound and phlegm. Due to lung qi injury and the stir of spleen dampness, one coughs and has a sore throat. Additionally, &quot;Theory of Generating Qi&quot; states: If the lungs are harmed by humidity in autumn, one will certainly cough in winter. Generally, the autumn climate should be clear and austere; if it becomes contrary, the qi will surge upwards causing coughing, and if severe, it will stir spleen dampness leading to phlegm. When wind invades the lungs, it results in persistent sweating, headache, and ineffective phlegm and saliva. When heat invades the lungs, it causes urgent wheezing and coughing, a flushed face, and cold hands and feet, especially common in children. If fire invades the lungs, it leads to obstructed coughing, bloody saliva, and in severe cases, can cause bleeding from the seven orifices.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>When dryness invades the lungs, it leads to stagnant qi that obstructs and causes internal pain in the joints, profuse sweating in the head and face, alternating chills and fevers, dry skin, itchy dry sores, constipation, and thick, sticky nasal discharge. When cold invades the lungs, it may result from exposure to cold drinks, sitting or lying on damp ground in winter, or being exposed to cold winds in spring and autumn, or from external pathogenic factors. Summer sees the most severe fiery heat rising, autumn brings damp heat injuring the lungs, and winter brings external wind cold, each requiring treatment according to its symptoms.</p>
<p>Jie Gu said: Lung illnesses manifest as coughs. Generally, in autumn and winter, conditions are replete, while in spring and summer, they are vacuous. One must examine the symptoms of the five viscera to distinguish between vacuity and repletion. If replete, there will be a reddened face when drinking water, heat in the body, abundant phlegm and saliva, thick and sticky nasal discharge, dry and obstructed throat, wheezing cough, facial swelling, and vomiting of food; one should first tonify the spleen with Yi Huang San, then drain the liver with Xie Qing Wan. If there is blood and pus, it indicates lung atrophy, which should be treated with Qing Fei San. If vacuous, the face will be pale and lacking color, with little qi and an inability to speak; there may be a sound in the throat, and the phlegm will be clear and thin; one should use E Jiao San to tonify. If there is a loss of bodily fluids, use Bai Zhu San to treat it.</p>
<p>Zeng Shi said: There are indeed several types of cough, but one can distinguish them by cold and heat, vacuity and repletion, and treat according to the symptoms. In the beginning, it is often due to catching a cold that injures the lungs.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The &quot;Internal Canon&quot; states: What causes coughing from the lungs? Qi Bo said: The skin and hair are associated with the lungs. The skin and hair first encounter evils, and these evils enter through their association. Therefore, the &quot;Nanjing&quot; says: Coldness and drinking cold things harm the lungs. This causes qi to rise and not descend, reversing and not being collected, blocking the throat and diaphragm, resulting in itchiness and the sensation of a blockage, which leads to coughing. When warmth is abruptly removed and sudden heat meets wind, evils invade the skin, the lungs are affected first, resulting in coughing. If at first one presents with a red face and lips, coarse breathing, and heat with a cough producing phlegm, this is due to wind cold causing phlegm-induced coughing. Clear lung decoction, Wuyou decoction, Xiao Chai Hu decoction, and Qiang Huo powder can all help to release the exterior; then use Qing Mu Xiang decoction. </p>
<p>If a child sweats and does not dry off, and suddenly plays in water, it can also lead to wind cold and coughing. The exterior signs include slightly swollen eyelids, forehead sweating, and phlegm sound; it is appropriate to give clear lung decoction or Xie Lung decoction to expel wind and resolve phlegm, and to alleviate heat and evils; Xiao Chai Hu decoction can also be used. </p>
<p>If coughing persists for a long time, fluids become depleted, indicating lung deficiency.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The lungs are the crown of all organs; they open when lying down and close when sitting. Thus, when lying down, the breath is short, and when sitting, it is somewhat easier. This is due to the lung being attacked and phlegm accumulating, which is called a &quot;weak cough.&quot; The sound is persistent and there is phlegm making noise in the throat, with the breath on the verge of failing. After coughing, there is expectoration of white foam and a desire to gag. This indicates lung deficiency and unregulated qi. The face and lips are pale and sallow, and after coughing, there is much sweating on the forehead, prolonged feeling of choking, and reduced appetite, leading to spleen deficiency and stomach weakness, which explains the vomiting. </p>
<p>Recommending the use of Fuling Houpo Decoction and Huoxiang Drink; then warming the spleen and nourishing the lungs with a modified Lizhong Decoction adding apricot kernels and north Schisandra berries, decocting in water for oral administration. These medicines nourish and benefit the lungs, using the earth’s qi to foster the metal, thus achieving self-recovery. If there is a cough with redness in the cheeks and a purplish dark hue, adding dried ginger to the Lizhong Decoction can also be an effective method.</p>
<p>In cases of spleen deficiency, cough can also occur, and it is advisable to use tonifying agents such as Xingshisan or Fuling Houpo Decoction to strengthen the spleen qi. After this, applying a Qingfei Decoction for oral administration will help expel wind-cold from the lung channels, while Huoxiang Drink aids in nourishing the stomach, serving as a method to benefit both child and mother.</p>
<p>In cases where cough reaches an extreme, leading to immediate vomiting of milk and food along with phlegm, the approach is to resolve it quickly. This condition is called wind-phlegm obstruction, with the liver’s wood overpowering the spleen’s earth. It is advisable to use Bai Fu Drink, which is effective immediately.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Cough in Infants under a Hundred Days</strong></p>
<p>This condition is called milk cough, and it is indeed difficult to manage. It can also be a severe symptom and requires careful examination of deficiency and excess to treat appropriately. For excess conditions, one should disperse; for deficiency, one should tonify. Symptoms include coarse qi and excessive phlegm, mouth sores, and heat in the eyes. After dispersing, one can use herbs such as Jin Yuan to clear excess. For symptoms of vomiting, fright, palpitations, fatigue, and spontaneous sweating after coughing, one should use Bu Fei San, Yi Huang San, or Tian Ma San to tonify the deficiency. Generally, for treating fright cough, Hu Po San is the main prescription. Tian Ma Yuan is a necessary medicine for infants less than one hundred days old suffering from persistent cough, far surpassing other remedies.</p>
<p>For infants under a hundred days who occasionally cough with phlegm and have disturbed sleep, this can be attributed to postnatal wind invasion. However, one should not overuse dispersing agents. First, give one or two doses of a release exterior formula, followed by Bei Mu Decoction or Xing Xing San for treatment. </p>
<p>For those with internal heat in the spleen and stomach, use Bao Long Wan; for external wind invasion, use Xing Xing San. Once phlegm heat is resolved and qi is still coarse with excessive phlegm, or if there is drooling, it indicates spleen and lung qi deficiency, and one should use Yi Gong San with Jie Geng. If there are mouth sores, heat in the eyes, and firm stools, use San Huang Wan. If stools are not firm, use Bai Zhu San. If there is vomiting without milk, fatigue, spontaneous sweating, or abdominal distension, it suggests spleen and stomach qi deficiency, and one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang with Chai Hu. If there are symptoms of fright, palpitations, fatigue, and excessive phlegm with no milk, it indicates heart and spleen blood deficiency, treated with Si Jun Zi Tang plus Chuan Xiong, Gui, and Suan Zao Ren. Additionally, if the wet nurse consumes strong flavors like five pungent spices leading to the infant&#39;s condition, consider the various coughing symptoms as well.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Coughing and Noisy Sounds</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Sacred Benefits&quot; states: When a child coughs and makes sounds, it is due to a buildup of phlegm in the chest. The cough stirs this phlegm, which then collides in the throat. As the phlegm interacts with the air, the sound accompanies the cough. Although the essence of coughing may be the same, the treatment differs by adding medicines to dispel phlegm and break the stagnant liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Guo states: This ailment in children typically arises from invasion by summer heat and humidity, which, if not dispersed, leads to the transmission of pathogens to the heart and lungs, transforming into heat. Heat produces wind, and wind induces phlegm; the phlegm becomes thick and unyielding over time, forming hard lumps the size of beans, resulting in a &#39;mother phlegm.&#39; Tracing the root cause, it may stem from prolonged crying without rest, followed abruptly by milk or food, or feeding with sour and salty substances, causing stagnation and leading to phlegm. Seasonal changes might also bring wind, cold, heat, and humidity; or submersion in water could introduce water into the body, impacting the lungs. Thus, the mother phlegm is activated, and with it, wind and phlegm congeal, leading to shortness of breath and wheezing, forming a chronic condition. It is urgent to expel wind and transform phlegm, first using Wuling Powder combined with broadening gas and heat remedies, mixed with a little ginger juice and taken with boiling broth; then proceed with Zhi Mu Decoction, Xiong Huang Powder, Ruyi Ointment, and Ban Xia Pills.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Shock Cough</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from convulsions, and the shock subsides leading to coughing, it is referred to as shock cough. Mr. Mao prescribes Jinxing pills, along with a mixed qi powder for ingestion.</p>
<p><strong>Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Zeng states: Wheezing in children is more severe than coughing, but it varies between deficiency and excess, as well as heat and cold, and cannot be generalized. For excess heat, administer Qingfei Decoction combined with Wuhuo Soup, and decoct with water, ginger, and scallions; also, use Xiefei Decoction and Biyu Pills for treatment. The classics say that acute wheezing often results from excess qi, as the lungs govern qi. For deficiency cold, administer Zhishi Decoction, decocting with water and ginger, as well as Ruyi Paste, Pulmonary Tonic Powder, and Kanli Decoction which are effective. This arises from lung deficiency exposing the child to wind and preventing the rise and fall of qi, hence using Dingchuan Decoction is often effective, and it can be taken regardless of whether it&#39;s hot or cold. For phlegm obstruction and loss of voice, Ersheng San is indicated. Mr. Yunqi states: For children with excessive internal heat leading to wheezing, use Sishun Qingliang Decoction. Mr. Danxi states: For phlegm cough and phlegm wheezing, employ methods to induce vomiting. For heavy doses, use Guati Powder; for lighter doses, use Ku Shen and red adzuki bean powder, mixed with salted pig’s juice for ingestion.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p>
<h3>Lung Discussion</h3>
<p>When the lung qi is strong, the skin is bright, smooth, and the hair is fine and dark. If the lung qi is weak, the skin appears withered. Without skin, the blood coagulates; hence, &quot;The Precious Mirror&quot; also refers to this condition as blood coagulation. Master Sun said that when a child is born, the muscles are still blood, which gradually hardens. The lungs govern the skin; if the lung qi is insufficient, the blood fails to nourish the skin, leading to a state where the skin is absent and blood coagulates. The face and around the nose and mouth become yellow; the eyes are closed, the face is drawn, the mouth is dry, and the limbs cannot move. The child cries silently and does not suckle; this indicates that the skin and hair are not constricted, often resulting in infertility. Treatment as per &quot;The Thousand Golds&quot; is with the Longdantang formula.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Lungs</strong></p>
<p>The condition of the lungs should appear white; do not let them show a distinct shape. The nose may appear dark and dry, and there may be abdominal distension with sunken eyes. [The lungs govern the nose; if they are deficient, the liver will rebel, causing a dark hue. Moreover, if the lungs are deficient, there will be no mucus, hence the dryness of the nostrils. The lungs also govern the eyes; if they are deficient, the eyes will sink.] The neck is stiff, with sudden breathing, and the chest is bulging without a return echo. [The lungs govern qi; if they are deficient, breathing will be acute, and the neck will be stiff to draw in qi. When the qi is depleted, the chest fills and bulges, only allowing for exhalation without inhalation.] Encountering this condition in autumn brings forth ailments from all directions.</p>
<p><strong>On Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The main method for treating cough is to drain if it is severe, tonify if it has persisted, and disperse if it is due to wind. Adjust the treatment according to the size, weakness, or strength of the condition. Thus, it is essential to protect children carefully; they should wear a cotton undershirt even in the hot summer months, with an extra layer on top to guard against wind and cold, which could harm the lungs and lead to coughing. A prolonged cough may also lead to fright. If a child under a hundred days old suffers from coughing, one in ten or twelve might recover fully; it is not a small illness. Also, coughs due to phlegm from retained fluids occur when children&#39;s milk intake is inappropriate, leading to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, causing stagnation of these fluids, which then congeal into phlegm, rising to irritate the lungs and cause coughing; this is classified as phlegm cough. If there is no cough, it suggests lung blockage and poor function, with throat obstruction, salivation issues, and stagnation in the sides, abdomen, and diaphragm.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Characteristics of the Lungs</strong></p>
<p>The characteristics of the lungs are related to dryness in the heavens, metal on the earth, the lungs in humans, and autumn in the seasons. The spleen is the mother, the kidneys are the child, which control the liver wood and govern the storage of qi and the soul. The sound corresponds to weeping, the fluid corresponds to tears, its taste is spicy, and the nose is its orifice. Externally, it corresponds to the skin and hair, and its color is predominantly white, which is favored for its brightness, not desiring a gray color. Cold body heat may damage the lung meridian; a pale face indicates illness, while a red face suggests rebellion. If the lung meridian is weak, there will be nasal discharge and dryness in the throat, with wheezing and coughing up blood. If the lung meridian is strong, there will be dry cough and nasal cold. If the lung meridian is depleted, sweating will be profuse, with incessant wheezing. The autumn pulse is light and weak, and if it is a thief pulse, it will be large and firm. If it is a dangerous pulse, it feels as if blown by the wind. The strong lung condition drains the kidneys, while a weak lung condition tonifies the spleen. </p>
<p>The lungs govern the tip of the nose, with the nasal openings referred to as &quot;well and stove,&quot; and should not be exposed. If the nostrils are black and sunken, like coal tar, the lung condition is severe, and treatment will be difficult. If the nose is red and itchy, there may be prolonged worms or excessive consumption leading to white nasal discharge, with a cold head feeling fatigued. Frequently having a runny nose indicates a cold, with a propensity to sleep. If sores develop under the nose, or ulcers arise, it indicates a severe condition. Constant breath from the nose indicates accumulated heat, leading to disaster.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>A child&#39;s cough is due to the wet nurse&#39;s fault, and the pills and powders are the fault of the doctor. Whenever there is a cough, one must investigate both the exterior and interior. If it&#39;s due to heat, resolve the exterior and regulate the qi gently. Harmonize the three burners and nourish the lung channels. Transform phlegm and reduce heat, avoiding wind and being cautious with cold. One must not sweat unnecessarily, nor purge excessively! When there is a runny nose with clear mucus, a pale face, thin phlegm, and symptoms lighter during the day but heavier at night with slight evil heat, it is due to a cold cough. If the nose is hot, the face red, phlegm thick, with a fast pulse, and heavier symptoms at night but lighter during the day, it indicates the source of a heat cough. The method for treating cough is to first strengthen the spleen and soil; when the spleen is strong, the lung naturally becomes peaceful. If lips are retracted, the chest sunken, the nose blocked without treatment, leading to loss of voice and wheezing, even the divine physician would find it difficult to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Coughing with Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm is the offspring of wind; when the fire is calm, it lies within the spleen, but when stirred, it obstructs the lungs. When phlegm and fire combine, the result is cough and wheezing, suitable for the application of Baisan combined with a phlegm-dispelling decoction. The spleen and lungs are mother and child; if both organs are deficient, stubborn phlegm arises. Stubborn phlegm emerges from the spleen and lungs. When it overflows in the throat, it sounds like the croaking of water chickens, causing anxious coughs and wheezing, suitable for the use of Baolong Pills and Duoming Powder. For horse spleen wind, it is advisable to use Mapi Feng San, Niuhuang Duoming San, and Bao Ming Dan.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Bamboo Juice Decoction</strong><br>This treats children born about two hundred days prior who suffer from small sores on their heads and bodies, or who have recurring minor ailments. In the middle of May, if they suddenly develop a slight cough with mild temperature, it can lead to convulsions, manifesting as twenty episodes a day, with limbs contracting, back arching, and eyes rolling back. They may temporarily lose consciousness, but after a considerable time, they can regain it. They have already been treated with standard convulsion decoction, leading to significant vomiting and purging, without interruption throughout the day. Then, they are given only bamboo juice, administered gradually—about one sheng throughout the day and evening, taken at intervals during episodes. The next day, give this bamboo juice decoction to induce vomiting and purging, which will greatly reduce the episodes, while still slightly administering bamboo juice.  </p>

If lung deficiency causes the liver wood to overpower, first use Ejiao San and afterwards use Xie Qing Wan. If due to the nursing mother&#39;s lung channel being afflicted, causing issues for the child, the mother should take the above powder.

This formula is only applicable if the condition is serious.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>For children who spit phlegm, it may be caused by wind obstruction or cough with fever, leading to vomiting after eating: Soak half an ounce of Pinellia in water seven times, add a small amount of clove, prepare a paste with the powder of Pinellia mixed with water and wrap the cloves, cover with dough, steam until cooked, then remove the dough and grind into powder.

<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compilation&quot; mentions: for children with persistent cough, moxibustion at the lung shu point, positioned 1.5 cun beside the lower part of the third vertebra in the back.</p>
<p>The &quot;Evidence-Based Treatment Principles&quot; states: for children with swelling and asthma, popularly known as horse spleen wind or wind throat, measure the child&#39;s middle finger from the palm lines to the fingertip. Cut two grass stalks, position them slightly inclined from the milk aperture, with an upright stance and cross a third stalk at the tips, then puncture the acupoints and moxibustion three times. This method has often led to recovery.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>Medical Cases</p>
<p>In the Qian family’s &quot;Direct Principles,&quot; it is said: A five-year-old boy from the Du family had a cough with phlegm in mid-winter; this was due to wind and cold injuring the lungs. He was treated with Mahuang Pills to clear the lungs, followed by Ejiao Powder to nourish the lungs, repeated three times, but his condition worsened. The teacher said: &quot;Clearing the lungs did not lead to improvement, and nourishing the lungs did not resolve the illness; there is nothing more to be done.&quot; Ultimately, he experienced severe wheezing and passed away.</p>
<p>Li Yunshi&#39;s son was eight years old, suffering from cough, a feeling of fullness in the chest, and shortness of breath. Some suggested that there was heat in the lung meridian and prescribed Bamboo Leaf Decoction and Niuhuang Paste, each twice a day; after three days, he experienced increased wheezing. The teacher said: &quot;This is due to deficiency of lung qi combined with cold evil. Treat it with herbs that tonify the spleen and lungs to cure him.&quot; Using Bamboo Leaf and Niuhuang, which are heart medicines, to treat the lungs was a mistake.</p>
<p>Zhang family&#39;s grandson, aged nine, had wheezing and cough, felt congested, could not stop drinking water, and could not eat; he was given cooling medicines, but after a month, there was no improvement. The teacher said: &quot;These cooling medicines harmed the stomach. Administer Yishi Powder to tonify the spleen, and Bai San to clear the lung, allowing for recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Duanzhai&#39;s son, aged four, had a cough with fever, and coughed up blood for several days. Some recommended Ganju Decoction and Fangji Pill, but he had phlegm rising and could not stop coughing or wheezing. A dose of Bianyin Pill was given to purge him, followed by treatment with a powder to nourish the lungs. Some argued: &quot;The symptoms indicate lung deficiency; why purge?&quot; The teacher responded: &quot;The lung meridian has heat, plus phlegm rising causes coughing spasms, so it is appropriate to first clear the phlegm and then nourish the spleen and lungs for recovery.&quot;<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>In &quot;Young Science Expressed,&quot; it is stated: A child coughs, takes Baolong Pills, but instead vomits, has diarrhea, and does not breastfeed; with abdominal bloating and fever, use Liu Junzi Decoction, and both mother and child recover. Later, the mother drinks alcohol and still coughs; use Qingwei Powder with added Quya, and the mother takes it, resulting in the child&#39;s recovery as well.</p>
<p>A child suffers from a cough, and upon taking medications like Qingtan, vomits breast milk and develops a fever, accompanied by abdominal bloating; this indicates injury to the spleen and stomach leading to internal heat. Use Yigong Powder with added Diaoteng for gradual recovery, then take the previous medicine with added Donggui for comfort.</p>
<p>A child with a cough takes Niuhuang Qingxin Pills but develops panting and abdominal bloating; this indicates deficiency of spleen and lung Qi. Use Liu Junzi Decoction for immediate recovery.</p>
<p>Cai Shajiang, a scholar from Qishui, had a son who was ill with a cough that persisted for a long time, so he sought my treatment. When I arrived, I saw the child continuously coughing, turning pale during the cough, and shaking his right hand. I told Shajiang: Your son cannot be treated. Shajiang asked why. I replied: The cough indicates lung disease; the lung belongs to metal; the pale face reflects the liver&#39;s color; the liver belongs to wood; the shaking hand indicates the force of liver wind wanting to manifest. Wood overcomes metal, which is fearful in this condition. </p>
<p>October corresponds to metal, and metal is weak when wood grows; the four seasons must progress, where future elements advance, and successful elements retreat. Fire promotes growth, metal suffers and recedes; convulsions are untreatable. The critical days of Jia and Yi came. Indeed, on those days, he convulsed and died.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Overview&quot; states: Wind in the lungs often begins with a cough, but if one only takes cough medicine, it cannot dispel the wind pathogen that has entered the lung channels. This leads to urgent wheezing, a complexion of green and yellow, the ability to recognize others but an inability to speak. If the physician cannot make a clear diagnosis and waits passively, is this not a disgrace? The daughter of the Minister Wang from Shaoxing accompanied an old woman who suffered from this illness and died after half a month; common physicians were unable to recognize it. Zhang Nanxuan also contracted this illness and passed away. Later, the son of Lou Bage fell ill with similar symptoms. At that time, it was a singular qi issue, and all physicians said there was no remedy and withdrew. The father and son came to urgently seek help, and I went to examine him. I prepared a decoction of three ingredients: tangerine peel, white mulberry bark, and poppy husk, combined it with two doses of Baibu pills, and applied moxa on the lung shu point. His wheezing immediately ceased, and he could suddenly speak, then asked for porridge, thus he was saved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Golden Mirror of Infant Care&quot; states: A child suffered from a cough and took the Niu Huang Qingxin Pill, but presented with severe wheezing and abdominal distension. Upon examination, I found that his right cheek was red and the pulse was patterned like a spear, indicating damage to the spleen qi; I used Liu Junzi Decoction to bring immediate relief.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　痰乃风苗，火静则伏于脾，火动则壅于肺。痰火交作，则咳嗽喘急，宜泻白散合导痰汤。脾肺，母子也，二脏俱虚，则生顽涎。顽涎者，脾肺所出也。涎则流溢在于咽喉，如水鸡之声，喘嗽烦闷，宜抱龙丸、夺命散。　　马脾风宜用马脾风散、牛黄夺命散、保命丹。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>　　　　方</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Critique of the Theory of Reality and Emptiness</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: When a child has wind-heat with wheezing and shoulder breathlessness, what is the pulse like? Qi Bo replied: In cases of wheezing and shoulder breathlessness, the pulse is firm and large. When it is slow, life arises; when it is rapid, death ensues. [Note: This further discusses the acquired vital energy produced postnatally, which should also not be harmed. The vital energy is the foundation originating from the five organs, six viscera, and twelve meridians, hence called vital energy. Shoulder breathlessness indicates breathing that shakes the shoulders. Wind-heat harm initially affects the skin and hair. Wheezing and shoulder breathlessness indicate that excessive wind-heat has dried up the lung&#39;s vital energy, resulting in a firm and large pulse. The pulse&#39;s harmony and slowness derive from the stomach&#39;s yang energy. If rapid, the stomach’s essence is lost, thus leading to death.]</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of Coughing with Variable Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Coughing indicates a slight cold in the lungs. During the months of August and September, when lung energy is robust, if one coughs with a flushed face and has abundant phlegm and body heat, it is appropriate to use Ting Li Pill to address it; if it has been a long-term ailment, it should not be purged. In November and December, coughing indicates a cold-induced cough. The wind enters through the pulmonary back shu point at the third vertebra and should be treated with Ma Huang Decoction to induce sweating. If there are signs of heat with a flushed face and difficulty swallowing water, it should be treated in combination with Gan Ju Decoction. If during May and July there is significant body heat and dry expectoration, use Bian Yin Pill; if there is no heat but only coughing, use Ting Li Pill primarily, followed by phlegm-resolving medication. If one coughs and then wheezes with facial swelling, it indicates excessive lung fire, which should be countered with Xie Bai San to clear it.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing with back pain indicates that the wind pathogen has harmed the kidneys; use the Mahuang, Fuzhu, and Xixin Decoction. If coughing is accompanied by urinary incontinence, it suggests bladder qi deficiency; use the Fuling and Gancao Decoction. If there is abdominal fullness, facial swelling, and lack of appetite, it indicates spleen deficiency with qi counterflow; use the Wuwei Yigong Powder. </p>
<p>Danxi said: Coughing in the morning indicates heat in the stomach; coughing at dusk indicates deficiency of spleen and lung qi; coughing in the afternoon indicates kidney Yin fire. Generally, cough syndromes arise from lung qi deficiency, where the pores are not tight, allowing external pathogens to invade. If wind invades the protective layer, it causes difficulty in exhaling, and if heat reaches the nourishing level, it prevents inhalation. The clash of wind and heat causes stagnation of blood and qi in the lungs. A rapid but weak pulse at the cun indicates lung atrophy; a rapid but strong pulse indicates lung abscess. These conditions result from excessive sweating leading to depletion of body fluids. The Mahuang Decoction is a remedy for inducing sweating and resolving the exterior, while the Tingli Pill is used for internal smoothing and draining. The Baipingzi also serves as a draining agent, and these should only be used if the symptoms correspond. If indiscriminately administered, it will lead to a serious depletion of body fluids and result in a failed condition.</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Asthma</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of symptoms, both related to phlegm and heat. Some may occur abruptly after exposure to wind and cold, while others may arise from the consumption of salty or acidic foods and beverages. Therefore, when the Yang is strong, the illness manifests and persists without end. For mild cases, a single dose of Wuhutang can suffice to stop it; for severe cases, the use of Tingli Wan is advisable, which is effective for immediate relief. If one desires to eradicate the root cause, internal use of Wusheng Dan and external application of moxibustion is recommended, targeting the heart point on the left back and the Zusanli point, each to be moxibusted three times. Additionally, avoidance of sour, salty, spicy, and hot foods is required. </p>
<p>Asthma often becomes a chronic condition, especially when the sky is overcast and rain is imminent, and treatment should focus on releasing the exterior and promoting phlegm elimination. Jiubao is often effective in such cases. If the exterior pathogen has not been eliminated, start with Wuhutang, and for internal fullness, prioritize Tingli Wan. It is unsuitable to use arsenic to form pills, as it can endanger the children&#39;s lives.</p>
<p><strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>There are three treatment methods: one for inducing sweating, one for promoting diarrhea, and one for clearing and tonifying. For initial onset with wind-cold exposure, mild cases can be treated with Su Chen Jiubao Tang, while severe cases may require Wuhutang, which acts swiftly. If a cough persists accompanied by fever and difficult breathing, it indicates a lurking fire in the lungs, treat it with Tingli Wan to ease symptoms. If the cough persists with lung deficiency, leading to continuous symptoms, tonifying the lungs is necessary, primarily using Ejiao Wan. If the cough is prolonged with incessant sounds, and there is bleeding from the mouth and nose, the treatment should focus on Maogen Tang, which is remarkably effective. If coughing occurs in summer, it should be treated with Jiawei Baihutang, and sweating or purging should be avoided. For severe cough and asthma, use Lìtān Wán as the main remedy.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Infant Concerns: Breathing Difficulties</strong></p>
<p>It is discussed that children may experience wheezing due to various causes. Some might wheeze from fear or shock affecting their heart and lungs, leading to a deficiency of qi. Others may wheeze from a cold causing congestion in the lungs, or from a cough due to an external wind, resulting in lung deficiency. Additionally, consuming salty food could harm lung qi, causing phlegm and wheezing. Eating hot or toxic foods may agitate the body&#39;s three burners, accumulating heat and causing a reversal of lung and liver energy, which also results in wheezing. There are distinctions in severity between wheezing and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Wheezing manifests as an open mouth unable to speak, with a feeling of tightness in the chest and short, rapid breaths, leading to a sense of distress. For wheezing triggered by shock and acute lung distress, the major remedy is the &quot;Xiong Zhu Hua Tan Ding Chuan Wan&quot; combined with &quot;Tian Ma Ding Chuan Yin.&quot; For wheezing due to a cold with lung congestion, treatments such as &quot;Xiao Qing Long Tang,&quot; &quot;Ma Huang Xing Ren Gan Cao Shi Gao Tang&quot; are employed, differentiating between cold and heat for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>For wheezing caused by an external wind cough and lung deficiency, &quot;San Ao Tang&quot; is adjusted as necessary. If the wheezing is attributed to salty food, one can consume fresh tofu. If heat is present, treatment should involve cooling remedies for the lungs to settle wheezing. In cases of asthma, using Xu Shuzheng&#39;s sixteen methods for treating asthma has proven effective. </p>
<p>Additionally, if wheezing occurs after sweating or purging, remedies like &quot;Ge Gen,&quot; &quot;Huang Lian,&quot; and &quot;Huang Qin&quot; are indicated; in severe cases, &quot;Ting Li Zi&quot; is added. For pronounced wheezing, &quot;Ting Li Wan&quot; can ease tension and restore appetite, and &quot;Qian Jin She Gan Tang&quot; is highly effective for treating cough and wheezing emergencies.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ho (Nasal Obstruction)</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Sacred Treatise&quot; discusses nasal obstruction, stating that the lung meridian is affected by wind and cold, resulting in cough and cold stagnating in the lungs, which leads to phlegm production. This causes the organs to become heated, disrupting restful sleep and leading to nasal obstruction, producing a sound similar to a saw when breathing through the throat. If a child exhibits this condition, they can take Tongguan Mei Hua Decoction, Banxia Pill, as well as Baoshou Powder, Xiaogui Ming Powder, and Jiejia Powder, with two or three doses for relief. If the nasal obstruction resembles a mass syndrome, and the throat sounds like a saw, it indicates the lung is affected by wind evil, causing rapid breathing, bluish complexion on the face and lips, and deep retraction under the neck, with phlegm sticky like glue and foul-smelling breath. Such cases are deemed untreatable.</p>
<p><strong>Asthma</strong></p>
<p>When asked about a child’s asthma, common belief is that it is caused by violating the earth, thought to be the Earth Deity. Some engage in activities such as grinding grain, cooking, or excavating wells and filling them, or opening drainage ditches, during which if a child has asthma, it is assumed they have undoubtedly violated the earth. Some follow practitioners to retreat the earth’s influence; others inscribe talismans to place on the disturbed ground; or employ spellbound water to burn the talismans for medicinal concoctions, or calculate the nine palaces of the home to determine where the Earth Deity resides, when the sun sets, and drink the earth from the sun&#39;s place, believing this can relieve the Earth Deity&#39;s affliction and ease the asthma. There have been instances where this has yielded positive results.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In all the medical texts throughout the ages, there are countless volumes; why is this evidence not included, but only left to be treated by those of lower status? Please clarify this for me! </p>
<p>It is said that when a child experiences wheezing, it is often due to being constrained by wind and cold from the outside, which obstructs the pores and prevents the lung qi from circulating, causing illness. The treatment should use Qian&#39;s Xie Bai San or San Yao Tang and similar remedies to open the pores, allowing the lung qi to flow freely, thus easing the wheezing. </p>
<p>Sometimes this wheezing occurs after vomiting or diarrhea, leading to insufficient central qi, which also causes shortness of breath and wheezing. The treatment can involve Qian&#39;s Yi Huang San, Dong Yuan&#39;s Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, or even Fulong Gan steeped in warm water for consumption, which has been effective in stopping the wheezing. </p>
<p>When the spleen is greatly deficient, it must rely on the earth&#39;s qi for nourishment. Some practitioners, noticing this principle, craftily name and label it, claiming that the earth&#39;s qi of the sun can calm the earth. However, since children exhibit various symptoms—some may have convulsions and stare straight while wheezing, while others may have full lungs and rapid breathing—even if one takes the earth&#39;s qi from the sun and irrigates with it, it still cannot save one in a million cases.</p>
<p>Doctors should properly adjust and treat based on established formulas and methods, rather than being misled by the practices of lower-tier practitioners that could cause confusion!<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<h4>Lungs</h4>
<p>Children have less developed skin pores, making them susceptible to external pathogens leading to lung diseases. For cases needing lung cleansing, use Qingfei Pills; if there is spleen and stomach qi deficiency causing lung issues, use Six Gentlemen Decoction; if there is spleen and stomach qi excess with bowel obstruction, use Xiehuang Powder; if heart fire is scorching lung metal, use Dihuang Pills. </p>
<h4>Coughs</h4>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: A cough indicates mild cold in the lungs, especially prevalent between August and September when lung qi is abundant. If there is a red face and body heat, the illness is substantial; in this case, administer Tingli Pills. For chronic coughs, do not use purgatives. In winter, if the cough is due to a cold, use Mahuang Decoction to induce sweating. If the face is red and there is difficulty drinking, coughing up purulent phlegm, and throat discomfort, use Ganju Decoction for clearing. If preceded by cough and followed by wheezing, with facial swelling and body heat, this shows strong lung qi; use Xie Bai Powder to balance it. For a cough with salivation of phlegm or milk, use Baipingzi to treat. Jie Gu states: If there is pain in both sides during a cough, it is related to the liver channel; use Xiao Chaihu Decoction. For coughing followed by vomiting of bitter water, it relates to the gallbladder channel; use Huangqin Banxia Shengjiang Decoction. For cough with obstruction in the throat, it pertains to the heart channel; use Ganju Decoction. A cough causing loss of breath relates to the small intestine; use Shaoyao Gancao Decoction. A cough with right-sided pain relates to the spleen channel; use Shengma Decoction. Coughing leading to vomiting of long worms relates to the stomach channel; use Wumei Pills. A cough with wheezing and coughing blood relates to the lung channel; use Mahuang Decoction.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

Coughing with urinary incontinence relates to the bladder, treated with a decoction of poria and licorice. Coughing accompanied by abdominal fullness, loss of appetite, facial swelling, and reversed qi pertains to the three burners, treated with the modified Yigong powder. If there is coughing and a runny nose due to external pathogens harming the lungs, start with the ginseng and perilla drink. For wheezing with flushed face, indicating excess heart fire injuring the lungs, use ginseng to soothe the lungs powder, along with the six-ingredient earth essence pill. If coughing produces greenish sputum, indicating liver wood invading the spleen, use the Yigong powder with additional bupleurum and platycodon. If phlegm resembling milk is expelled, indicating spleen and lung qi deficiency, use the six gentlemen&#39;s decoction with added platycodon. For coughing with purulent sputum, indicating heat accumulation in the lungs resulting in lung abscess, use the platycodon decoction. Generally, for external wind pathogens causing harm, one should disperse the exterior and solidify the pores; if using purgatives, it must not be due to internal transmission of pathogens or actual heat in the stomach, as this should not be taken lightly.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>The condition of wheezing is often due to deficiency of both the spleen and lungs. When the protective layers are not dense, external pathogens can invade, leading to a situation where the true vital energy is weak and the pathogenic energy is strong. If the wheezing has already developed, the focus should be on dispelling the evil. If it has not yet developed, the focus should be on tonifying the spleen. If we simply attack the evil, it will damage the true vital energy, and if we directly tonify the lungs, it will only benefit the pathogenic energy. In any case of wheezing and coughing, if urination is not smooth, then there will surely be bloating. Bloating leads to wheezing, so it is essential to differentiate between the root (the fundamental cause) and the branch (the manifestation) in order. If wheezing occurs before bloating, the primary cause is in the lungs; if bloating occurs before wheezing, the primary cause lies with the spleen.</p>
<p>The Lung, belonging to the metal element, is responsible for descending energy, while its external aspect governs the skin and hair. The lungs connect to the hundred vessels, regulate the water pathways, and direct fluids to the bladder. If the lungs are invaded by pathogens, they lose the ability to descend and discharge, leading to increasingly reduced urination, which causes fluid to overflow into the skin and result in swelling. In this case, wheezing is the root and swelling is the branch; treatment should primarily focus on clearing metal and descending fire, with fluid regulation as a secondary concern.</p>
<p>The Spleen, associated with the earth element, dislikes dampness and governs the muscles. The earth element can control water, but if the spleen is impaired and cannot control fluids, water and dampness can behave erratically, soaking into the muscles. Once the fluid overflows, it can invade the lung qi, preventing it from descending and causing wheezing. Here, swelling is the root and wheezing is the branch; treatment should primarily focus on strengthening the spleen and regulating fluids, with clearing metal as a secondary concern. If drying herbs meant for the spleen are used for lung conditions, metal becomes dry and the wheezing worsens; conversely, using cooling herbs meant for metal in spleen conditions will cause cold in the spleen and exacerbate swelling.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>Newborn infants often experience coughing within the first hundred days of life, where their delicate lungs are particularly difficult to treat. Typically, when cold or pathogenic factors enter the lungs, they cannot expel them effectively and are unable to vomit or produce bowel movements. It is essential to identify the source of illness, clear away wind and cold, transform phlegm and smooth qi, nourish the lungs and generate fluids, open the stomach, and strengthen qi, leading to a gradual reduction of cough. Do not be overly aggressive in treatment! </p>
<p>Cold coughs are characterized by a runny nose with clear discharge, a pale face, thin phlegm, and symptoms worsening at night. Heat coughs manifest with a slightly reddened face, dry nose, thick and hot phlegm, and a rapid pulse. Gastric heat not due to wind and cold can cause irritability in infants, leading to cough and reverse flow of milk, which should be addressed with specific remedies. According to Qian’s method for treating cough, one should first strengthen the spleen; when the spleen is robust, the lungs will function harmoniously. </p>
<p>For infants with coughing, if the protective layers have been disturbed by wind and pathogens, resulting in a flushed face and rapid breathing, one must discern between deficiency and excess; signs such as thin lips, a sunken chest, and a dry, darkened nose indicate a poor prognosis.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs are responsible for wheezing. </p>
<p>In cases of excess, there is a chaotic and rapid wheeze, with some drinking water and others not. In cases of deficiency, there is a prolonged gasp for air. </p>
<p>When lung disease manifests as chaos, prolonged gasping, and shortness of breath with a rapid inhale, if there is heat in the lungs, pressing on the brows, eyes, nose, and face is advised, and 甘桔汤 (Sweet Tangerine Decoction) is recommended. If there is an excess of lung heat accompanied by wind and cold, with fullness in the chest and shortness of breath, one should first disperse the lung, and then dispel wind and cold. For this, 润肺泻白散 (Moistening Lung and Draining White Powder) and 大青膏 (Da Qing Ointment) are indicated. If the lungs are solely affected by cold, there will not be fullness in the chest. </p>
<p>For lung deficiency with heat, the lips will have a deep red color; treatment involves dispersing the lung’s deficient heat and taking a small amount of 润肺泻白散. If the lungs are weak and the lips are pale, one should bolster the lungs, and 阿胶散 (Ejiao Powder) should be used. If there is confusion, coarse breath, and rapid wheezing, this is difficult to treat due to lung deficiency. </p>
<p>If the spleen and lung disease persists, they become deficient and the lips may turn white. The spleen is the mother of the lungs; when both are deficient, they cannot support each other, hence the term &#39;weak.&#39; The spleen governs the lips; if they are pale and moist, this is auspicious, but if they are as white as dry bone, it signifies death. </p>
<p>This is the method for diagnosing lung issues through the lips. Pale lips indicate a weak lung, to be treated with 阿胶散. If one finds themselves fiddling with collar and twisting objects, this indicates liver heat, and 青丸 (Qing Pill) should be used to drain it. Pressing on the brows, eyes, nose, and face indicates lung heat, suggesting treatments like 甘桔汤. </p>
<p>In spring, when the metal is strong, the lungs surpass the liver, and one should drain the lungs. If the condition is mild, the lung disease will recede, but if severe, the eyes become pale blue and are likely to shock; further redness may occur. As noted in 海藏: this represents liver weakness, resulting in pale blue eyes. </p>
<p>The lungs govern dryness; if the disease arises, it results in wheezing and coughing, hence dryness should be moistened.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the heart influences the lungs with evil heat, causing wheezing and coughing, start with Di Huang Wan, then use Zhong Dao Chi San, and follow with A Jiao San. </p>
<p>If the liver affects the lungs with a mild evil, causing aversion to wind, dizziness, and cough, Qiang Huo Gao is the main treatment. </p>

<p>If the spleen affects the lungs with a deficiency evil, bringing a heavy sensation, phlegm, and diarrhea, Ren Shen Bai Zhu San is the main treatment. </p>
<p>In general, when the lungs are ill, one must first observe the condition of the heart and spleen. If there is heart fire affecting the lungs, one should first suppress heart qi before addressing lung treatment. If heart qi is harmonious, one should look at the spleen pulse; if the spleen qi is deficient and cold, it cannot nourish the lungs properly, leading to vulnerability to wind evils, so those with lung cold often have spleen deficiency as the cause. If the spleen qi is strong and real, it may cause obstruction in the middle burner, making it difficult for the large intestine and lungs to communicate. When heat blocks the middle burner, the lungs and large intestine cannot connect, and the heat toxin will rise to the lungs, resulting in phlegm; thus, patients with lung heat often suffer due to spleen excess.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

Then, one should treat according to the cold and heat of the lungs, leading to three remedies: to suppress heart energy, to benefit spleen energy, and to regulate lung energy. If the pulse indicates that both the heart and spleen are balanced, but the lung has its own illness, one should then examine the deficiency or excess of the lungs and treat accordingly.</p>
<p>For lung channel heat and stagnation, use Bai San (White Powder); for lung energy deficiency, use Si Junzi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction); for invasion of external pathogens, use Shen Su Yin (Ginseng and Perilla Decoction); for lung fire and dryness, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San (Ginseng Lung-Smoothing Powder); for a full sensation in the middle jiao, use Da Chengqi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction); if the spleen cannot generate the lung energy, use Yi Gong San (Specific Function Powder). </p>
<p>In cases of excessive lung energy, there is an excess of pathogenic energy within the lungs; the pulse at the right cun will be floating and strong, indicating the use of Bai San to drain it. If the lung is deficient but there is heat, it is a mistake to not use ginseng, adhering to the saying that lung heat harms the lungs without recognizing the signs to treat.</p>
<p>If the lung is troubled by upward-reversed energy, quickly consume bitter foods to drain it, such as haritaki peel, or alternatively, huangqin (scutellaria). If the lung desires to gather, quickly eat sour foods to gather it, such as white peony root; to supplement with sour, use Schisandra fruit; to drain with pungent, use mulberry white peel. </p>
<p>If the lungs are deficient, supplement with Schisandra fruit; if there are no other symptoms, Qian’s Lu Fei Ejiao San (Qian&#39;s Lung-Supplementing Gelatin Powder) should be administered. In deficiency, one must supplement its mother, as the spleen is the mother of the lung, using licorice to nourish the spleen. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All organs can cause coughing, not just the lungs. The skin and hair are the dwelling places of the lungs. The skin and hair are the first to be affected by evil qi, which then invades from its dwelling. Cough from the five organs, if prolonged, will eventually affect the six bowels. Furthermore, the &quot;Key Points of Pathogenesis&quot; says: A cough is characterized by sound without phlegm, indicating a depletion of lung qi leading to unclear airflow; a &quot;sore throat&quot; refers to phlegm without sound, as dampness in the spleen stirs up phlegm; coughing and &quot;sore throat&quot; together involve both sound and phlegm. Due to lung qi injury and the stir of spleen dampness, one coughs and has a sore throat. Additionally, &quot;Theory of Generating Qi&quot; states: If the lungs are harmed by humidity in autumn, one will certainly cough in winter. Generally, the autumn climate should be clear and austere; if it becomes contrary, the qi will surge upwards causing coughing, and if severe, it will stir spleen dampness leading to phlegm. When wind invades the lungs, it results in persistent sweating, headache, and ineffective phlegm and saliva. When heat invades the lungs, it causes urgent wheezing and coughing, a flushed face, and cold hands and feet, especially common in children. If fire invades the lungs, it leads to obstructed coughing, bloody saliva, and in severe cases, can cause bleeding from the seven orifices.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

When cold invades the lungs, it may result from exposure to cold drinks, sitting or lying on damp ground in winter, or being exposed to cold winds in spring and autumn, or from external pathogenic factors. Summer sees the most severe fiery heat rising, autumn brings damp heat injuring the lungs, and winter brings external wind cold, each requiring treatment according to its symptoms.</p>
<p>Jie Gu said: Lung illnesses manifest as coughs. Generally, in autumn and winter, conditions are replete, while in spring and summer, they are vacuous. One must examine the symptoms of the five viscera to distinguish between vacuity and repletion. If replete, there will be a reddened face when drinking water, heat in the body, abundant phlegm and saliva, thick and sticky nasal discharge, dry and obstructed throat, wheezing cough, facial swelling, and vomiting of food; one should first tonify the spleen with Yi Huang San, then drain the liver with Xie Qing Wan.

The skin and hair first encounter evils, and these evils enter through their association. Therefore, the &quot;Nanjing&quot; says: Coldness and drinking cold things harm the lungs. This causes qi to rise and not descend, reversing and not being collected, blocking the throat and diaphragm, resulting in itchiness and the sensation of a blockage, which leads to coughing. When warmth is abruptly removed and sudden heat meets wind, evils invade the skin, the lungs are affected first, resulting in coughing. If at first one presents with a red face and lips, coarse breathing, and heat with a cough producing phlegm, this is due to wind cold causing phlegm-induced coughing.

After coughing, there is expectoration of white foam and a desire to gag. This indicates lung deficiency and unregulated qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cough in Infants under a Hundred Days</strong></p>
<p>This condition is called milk cough, and it is indeed difficult to manage. It can also be a severe symptom and requires careful examination of deficiency and excess to treat appropriately. For excess conditions, one should disperse; for deficiency, one should tonify. Symptoms include coarse qi and excessive phlegm, mouth sores, and heat in the eyes. After dispersing, one can use herbs such as Jin Yuan to clear excess. For symptoms of vomiting, fright, palpitations, fatigue, and spontaneous sweating after coughing, one should use Bu Fei San, Yi Huang San, or Tian Ma San to tonify the deficiency. Generally, for treating fright cough, Hu Po San is the main prescription. Tian Ma Yuan is a necessary medicine for infants less than one hundred days old suffering from persistent cough, far surpassing other remedies.</p>
<p>For infants under a hundred days who occasionally cough with phlegm and have disturbed sleep, this can be attributed to postnatal wind invasion. However, one should not overuse dispersing agents. First, give one or two doses of a release exterior formula, followed by Bei Mu Decoction or Xing Xing San for treatment. </p>
<p>For those with internal heat in the spleen and stomach, use Bao Long Wan; for external wind invasion, use Xing Xing San. Once phlegm heat is resolved and qi is still coarse with excessive phlegm, or if there is drooling, it indicates spleen and lung qi deficiency, and one should use Yi Gong San with Jie Geng. If there are mouth sores, heat in the eyes, and firm stools, use San Huang Wan. If stools are not firm, use Bai Zhu San. If there is vomiting without milk, fatigue, spontaneous sweating, or abdominal distension, it suggests spleen and stomach qi deficiency, and one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang with Chai Hu. If there are symptoms of fright, palpitations, fatigue, and excessive phlegm with no milk, it indicates heart and spleen blood deficiency, treated with Si Jun Zi Tang plus Chuan Xiong, Gui, and Suan Zao Ren. Additionally, if the wet nurse consumes strong flavors like five pungent spices leading to the infant&#39;s condition, consider the various coughing symptoms as well.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Coughing and Noisy Sounds</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Sacred Benefits&quot; states: When a child coughs and makes sounds, it is due to a buildup of phlegm in the chest. The cough stirs this phlegm, which then collides in the throat. As the phlegm interacts with the air, the sound accompanies the cough. Although the essence of coughing may be the same, the treatment differs by adding medicines to dispel phlegm and break the stagnant liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Guo states: This ailment in children typically arises from invasion by summer heat and humidity, which, if not dispersed, leads to the transmission of pathogens to the heart and lungs, transforming into heat. Heat produces wind, and wind induces phlegm; the phlegm becomes thick and unyielding over time, forming hard lumps the size of beans, resulting in a &#39;mother phlegm.&#39; Tracing the root cause, it may stem from prolonged crying without rest, followed abruptly by milk or food, or feeding with sour and salty substances, causing stagnation and leading to phlegm. Seasonal changes might also bring wind, cold, heat, and humidity; or submersion in water could introduce water into the body, impacting the lungs. Thus, the mother phlegm is activated, and with it, wind and phlegm congeal, leading to shortness of breath and wheezing, forming a chronic condition. It is urgent to expel wind and transform phlegm, first using Wuling Powder combined with broadening gas and heat remedies, mixed with a little ginger juice and taken with boiling broth; then proceed with Zhi Mu Decoction, Xiong Huang Powder, Ruyi Ointment, and Ban Xia Pills.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a child suffers from convulsions, and the shock subsides leading to coughing, it is referred to as shock cough. Mr. Mao prescribes Jinxing pills, along with a mixed qi powder for ingestion.</p>
<p><strong>Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Zeng states: Wheezing in children is more severe than coughing, but it varies between deficiency and excess, as well as heat and cold, and cannot be generalized. For excess heat, administer Qingfei Decoction combined with Wuhuo Soup, and decoct with water, ginger, and scallions; also, use Xiefei Decoction and Biyu Pills for treatment. The classics say that acute wheezing often results from excess qi, as the lungs govern qi. For deficiency cold, administer Zhishi Decoction, decocting with water and ginger, as well as Ruyi Paste, Pulmonary Tonic Powder, and Kanli Decoction which are effective. This arises from lung deficiency exposing the child to wind and preventing the rise and fall of qi, hence using Dingchuan Decoction is often effective, and it can be taken regardless of whether it&#39;s hot or cold. For phlegm obstruction and loss of voice, Ersheng San is indicated. Mr. Yunqi states: For children with excessive internal heat leading to wheezing, use Sishun Qingliang Decoction. Mr. Danxi states: For phlegm cough and phlegm wheezing, employ methods to induce vomiting. For heavy doses, use Guati Powder; for lighter doses, use Ku Shen and red adzuki bean powder, mixed with salted pig’s juice for ingestion.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Lung Discussion</h3>
<p>When the lung qi is strong, the skin is bright, smooth, and the hair is fine and dark. If the lung qi is weak, the skin appears withered. Without skin, the blood coagulates; hence, &quot;The Precious Mirror&quot; also refers to this condition as blood coagulation. Master Sun said that when a child is born, the muscles are still blood, which gradually hardens. The lungs govern the skin; if the lung qi is insufficient, the blood fails to nourish the skin, leading to a state where the skin is absent and blood coagulates. The face and around the nose and mouth become yellow; the eyes are closed, the face is drawn, the mouth is dry, and the limbs cannot move. The child cries silently and does not suckle; this indicates that the skin and hair are not constricted, often resulting in infertility. Treatment as per &quot;The Thousand Golds&quot; is with the Longdantang formula.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<p>The condition of the lungs should appear white; do not let them show a distinct shape. The nose may appear dark and dry, and there may be abdominal distension with sunken eyes. [The lungs govern the nose; if they are deficient, the liver will rebel, causing a dark hue. Moreover, if the lungs are deficient, there will be no mucus, hence the dryness of the nostrils. The lungs also govern the eyes; if they are deficient, the eyes will sink.] The neck is stiff, with sudden breathing, and the chest is bulging without a return echo. [The lungs govern qi; if they are deficient, breathing will be acute, and the neck will be stiff to draw in qi. When the qi is depleted, the chest fills and bulges, only allowing for exhalation without inhalation.] Encountering this condition in autumn brings forth ailments from all directions.</p>
<p><strong>On Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The main method for treating cough is to drain if it is severe, tonify if it has persisted, and disperse if it is due to wind. Adjust the treatment according to the size, weakness, or strength of the condition. Thus, it is essential to protect children carefully; they should wear a cotton undershirt even in the hot summer months, with an extra layer on top to guard against wind and cold, which could harm the lungs and lead to coughing. A prolonged cough may also lead to fright. If a child under a hundred days old suffers from coughing, one in ten or twelve might recover fully; it is not a small illness. Also, coughs due to phlegm from retained fluids occur when children&#39;s milk intake is inappropriate, leading to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, causing stagnation of these fluids, which then congeal into phlegm, rising to irritate the lungs and cause coughing; this is classified as phlegm cough. If there is no cough, it suggests lung blockage and poor function, with throat obstruction, salivation issues, and stagnation in the sides, abdomen, and diaphragm.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Characteristics of the Lungs</strong></p>
<p>The characteristics of the lungs are related to dryness in the heavens, metal on the earth, the lungs in humans, and autumn in the seasons. The spleen is the mother, the kidneys are the child, which control the liver wood and govern the storage of qi and the soul. The sound corresponds to weeping, the fluid corresponds to tears, its taste is spicy, and the nose is its orifice. Externally, it corresponds to the skin and hair, and its color is predominantly white, which is favored for its brightness, not desiring a gray color. Cold body heat may damage the lung meridian; a pale face indicates illness, while a red face suggests rebellion. If the lung meridian is weak, there will be nasal discharge and dryness in the throat, with wheezing and coughing up blood. If the lung meridian is strong, there will be dry cough and nasal cold. If the lung meridian is depleted, sweating will be profuse, with incessant wheezing. The autumn pulse is light and weak, and if it is a thief pulse, it will be large and firm. If it is a dangerous pulse, it feels as if blown by the wind. The strong lung condition drains the kidneys, while a weak lung condition tonifies the spleen. </p>
<p>The lungs govern the tip of the nose, with the nasal openings referred to as &quot;well and stove,&quot; and should not be exposed. If the nostrils are black and sunken, like coal tar, the lung condition is severe, and treatment will be difficult. If the nose is red and itchy, there may be prolonged worms or excessive consumption leading to white nasal discharge, with a cold head feeling fatigued. Frequently having a runny nose indicates a cold, with a propensity to sleep. If sores develop under the nose, or ulcers arise, it indicates a severe condition. Constant breath from the nose indicates accumulated heat, leading to disaster.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>A child&#39;s cough is due to the wet nurse&#39;s fault, and the pills and powders are the fault of the doctor. Whenever there is a cough, one must investigate both the exterior and interior. If it&#39;s due to heat, resolve the exterior and regulate the qi gently. Harmonize the three burners and nourish the lung channels. Transform phlegm and reduce heat, avoiding wind and being cautious with cold. One must not sweat unnecessarily, nor purge excessively! When there is a runny nose with clear mucus, a pale face, thin phlegm, and symptoms lighter during the day but heavier at night with slight evil heat, it is due to a cold cough. If the nose is hot, the face red, phlegm thick, with a fast pulse, and heavier symptoms at night but lighter during the day, it indicates the source of a heat cough. The method for treating cough is to first strengthen the spleen and soil; when the spleen is strong, the lung naturally becomes peaceful. If lips are retracted, the chest sunken, the nose blocked without treatment, leading to loss of voice and wheezing, even the divine physician would find it difficult to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Coughing with Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm is the offspring of wind; when the fire is calm, it lies within the spleen, but when stirred, it obstructs the lungs. When phlegm and fire combine, the result is cough and wheezing, suitable for the application of Baisan combined with a phlegm-dispelling decoction. The spleen and lungs are mother and child; if both organs are deficient, stubborn phlegm arises. Stubborn phlegm emerges from the spleen and lungs. When it overflows in the throat, it sounds like the croaking of water chickens, causing anxious coughs and wheezing, suitable for the use of Baolong Pills and Duoming Powder. For horse spleen wind, it is advisable to use Mapi Feng San, Niuhuang Duoming San, and Bao Ming Dan.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

Xue Ji said: According to the &quot;Living Person&#39;s Prescriptions&quot;, wheezing indicates excess lung qi. When qi is vigorous, it should be understood as deficient, and when excess is present, it should be regarded as insufficient. Excess lung qi is actually the fire within the lungs being high. Therefore, the previous herbs are used to drain it. If the earth is deficient and cannot generate the lungs, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; if the fire is attacking metal, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San; if kidney water is taking away the mother’s qi or the yin fire is flaming upwards, use Di Huang Wan. If lung deficiency causes the liver wood to overpower, first use Ejiao San and afterwards use Xie Qing Wan. If due to the nursing mother&#39;s lung channel being afflicted, causing issues for the child, the mother should take the above powder. If the nursing mother catches wind and cold, with lung channel heat, leading to issues for the child, use Shi Wei Shen Su Yin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jiexī Sàn</strong>: This formula treats infants with common colds or fevers, characterized by a red, flushed face, fever throughout the body, stiffness in the neck and similar symptoms. When combined with Rénshēn Sàn, the fever may subside later on. The severity of the condition can be observed; if the symptoms are mild, with a pulse that is not rapid or strong, a face that is not overly red, and no increased irritability—just some groaning and murmuring—this indicates a lighter condition, but only this formula should be administered.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ginseng, vine of Diao (钓藤), Platycodon, licorice, and Chuanxiong, each 3 qian (approximately 9 grams).</li>
<li>A 1 qian (around 3 grams) of stir-fried Qingli (葶苈).</li>
<li>2 qian (about 6 grams) of white Poria.</li>
<li>49 pieces of apricot kernel.</li>
<li>4 liang (approximately 150 grams) of gypsum, calcined, and Ephedra (麻黄), with stems removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination should be ground into a fine powder. Each dose should be 2 qian, with one jujube and a cup of water, boiled down to half a cup to be taken. If the infant suffers from initial febrile illness, this medication should be administered first, ensuring careful recognition of symptoms. If it is measles, this medication should not be used. In cases of measles, the face appears pale and bluish, earlobes, knees, and tailbone feel cold like ice, the body is warm and strong, and signs of excitement and murmuring occur in dreams—these indicate that particular condition.</p>
<p>If a child with fever receives this Jiexī Sàn and gradually recovers, they can subsequently take Dà Guīmìng Sàn, Bǎoshòu Sàn, or Qingfěn Bái Zhú Sàn for further recuperation.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Cases</p>
<p>In the Qian family’s &quot;Direct Principles,&quot; it is said: A five-year-old boy from the Du family had a cough with phlegm in mid-winter; this was due to wind and cold injuring the lungs. He was treated with Mahuang Pills to clear the lungs, followed by Ejiao Powder to nourish the lungs, repeated three times, but his condition worsened. The teacher said: &quot;Clearing the lungs did not lead to improvement, and nourishing the lungs did not resolve the illness; there is nothing more to be done.&quot; Ultimately, he experienced severe wheezing and passed away.</p>
<p>Li Yunshi&#39;s son was eight years old, suffering from cough, a feeling of fullness in the chest, and shortness of breath. Some suggested that there was heat in the lung meridian and prescribed Bamboo Leaf Decoction and Niuhuang Paste, each twice a day; after three days, he experienced increased wheezing. The teacher said: &quot;This is due to deficiency of lung qi combined with cold evil. Treat it with herbs that tonify the spleen and lungs to cure him.&quot; Using Bamboo Leaf and Niuhuang, which are heart medicines, to treat the lungs was a mistake.</p>
<p>Zhang family&#39;s grandson, aged nine, had wheezing and cough, felt congested, could not stop drinking water, and could not eat; he was given cooling medicines, but after a month, there was no improvement. The teacher said: &quot;These cooling medicines harmed the stomach. Administer Yishi Powder to tonify the spleen, and Bai San to clear the lung, allowing for recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Duanzhai&#39;s son, aged four, had a cough with fever, and coughed up blood for several days. Some recommended Ganju Decoction and Fangji Pill, but he had phlegm rising and could not stop coughing or wheezing. A dose of Bianyin Pill was given to purge him, followed by treatment with a powder to nourish the lungs. Some argued: &quot;The symptoms indicate lung deficiency; why purge?&quot; The teacher responded: &quot;The lung meridian has heat, plus phlegm rising causes coughing spasms, so it is appropriate to first clear the phlegm and then nourish the spleen and lungs for recovery.&quot;<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

Later, the mother drinks alcohol and still coughs; use Qingwei Powder with added Quya, and the mother takes it, resulting in the child&#39;s recovery as well.</p>
<p>A child suffers from a cough, and upon taking medications like Qingtan, vomits breast milk and develops a fever, accompanied by abdominal bloating; this indicates injury to the spleen and stomach leading to internal heat.

When I arrived, I saw the child continuously coughing, turning pale during the cough, and shaking his right hand. I told Shajiang: Your son cannot be treated. Shajiang asked why. I replied: The cough indicates lung disease; the lung belongs to metal; the pale face reflects the liver&#39;s color; the liver belongs to wood; the shaking hand indicates the force of liver wind wanting to manifest. Wood overcomes metal, which is fearful in this condition. </p>
<p>October corresponds to metal, and metal is weak when wood grows; the four seasons must progress, where future elements advance, and successful elements retreat. Fire promotes growth, metal suffers and recedes; convulsions are untreatable. The critical days of Jia and Yi came. Indeed, on those days, he convulsed and died.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Overview&quot; states: Wind in the lungs often begins with a cough, but if one only takes cough medicine, it cannot dispel the wind pathogen that has entered the lung channels. This leads to urgent wheezing, a complexion of green and yellow, the ability to recognize others but an inability to speak. If the physician cannot make a clear diagnosis and waits passively, is this not a disgrace? The daughter of the Minister Wang from Shaoxing accompanied an old woman who suffered from this illness and died after half a month; common physicians were unable to recognize it. Zhang Nanxuan also contracted this illness and passed away. Later, the son of Lou Bage fell ill with similar symptoms. At that time, it was a singular qi issue, and all physicians said there was no remedy and withdrew. The father and son came to urgently seek help, and I went to examine him. I prepared a decoction of three ingredients: tangerine peel, white mulberry bark, and poppy husk, combined it with two doses of Baibu pills, and applied moxa on the lung shu point. His wheezing immediately ceased, and he could suddenly speak, then asked for porridge, thus he was saved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Golden Mirror of Infant Care&quot; states: A child suffered from a cough and took the Niu Huang Qingxin Pill, but presented with severe wheezing and abdominal distension.
