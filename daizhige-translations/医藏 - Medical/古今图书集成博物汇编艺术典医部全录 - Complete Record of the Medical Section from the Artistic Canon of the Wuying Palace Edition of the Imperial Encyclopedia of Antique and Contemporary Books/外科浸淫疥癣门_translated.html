<p><strong>The Door of Skin Diseases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essentials from the Golden Cabinet</strong> (Han Dynasty, by Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Pathology and Treatment of Skin Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Skin diseases that flow from the mouth to the limbs can be treated; those that flow from the limbs to the mouth cannot be treated. For skin sores, use powdered Huanglian.</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty, by Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Scabies and Eczema</strong></p>
<p>For any scab or sore, add two taels of black snake meat to the small Qinjiao powder for treatment. Adding one foot of black snake jerky to astragalus wine is also very effective. For all types of scabies and eczema, use mercury and pig fat, ground extremely fine for application. When sores and eczema first appear, or if they start to itch, various simple remedies can be used to address them, or apply salt after chewing. Additionally, apply wheat juice, garlic paste, turmeric, fish paste, or cow&#39;s plum juice. If these methods do not result in healing, then resort to larger medicinal formulas for treatment.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> [Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p><strong>Medication Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>For pus-filled abscesses, focus on treating heat and dryness with unnamed herbs. For dry skin diseases, prioritize relieving stagnation using evodia. For parasitic sores resembling ringworm, focus on reducing heat and eliminating parasites with herbs like pigweed, black dog spine, white alum, realgar, sulfur, and mercury. For exterminating parasites, use camphor and rosin, applying more to the scalp; for itching and parasite elimination, utilize coptis, calcite, and cnidium. Pine bark charcoal is essential for pus. If there is significant swelling, add angelica to relieve stagnation; if there is considerable pain, add angelica and calcite; if there are many parasites, add rhubarb and toad; if itching is intense, add dried alum; for scrotal sores, include evodia; if dampness is prevalent, adjust with fragrant oil. For severe itching and bleeding, incorporate rhubarb and coptis, mixed with pig&#39;s fat. For red conditions, add yellow lead; for blue conditions, add indigo; for a significant parasite presence, add tin ash, pigweed, and areca nut. For upper body issues, frequently use Tongsheng Powder, while for lower body issues, more purgatives are required. If there is swelling and bleeding in the feet, separate treatments for dampness and heat should be utilized. There are three types of sores: pus-filled blisters primarily treat heat.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment of Various Skin Sores</h3>
<p>In spring, when sores and scabs occur, it is advisable to focus on relieving emotional stagnation, rather than scratching or applying dressings. For unbearable pain from sores, use bitter-cold herbs combined with Huang Lian (Coptis) and Huang Qin (Scutellaria). Pay attention to using them based on the location of the symptoms and use channel-invigorating herbs as needed. It is said that for various sores, use Dang Gui (Angelica) and Huang Lian as the primary herbs, while Lian Qiao (Forsythia), Gan Cao (Licorice), and Huang Qin act as assistants. </p>
<p>Sores characterized by pain and itching are associated with heat. If the individual is robust, employ Si Wu Tang (Four Substances Decoction) with an addition of Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction). In cases where an impatient, dark, thin, heaty person suffers pain due to sores, they should use Si Wu Tang with Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Da Li Zi (large seed), and Gan Cao, adding Huang Bo (Phellodendron) if the sores are below. For individuals who are overweight and experience pain, attributed to damp-heat, use Fang Feng (Siler), Jing Jie (Schizonepeta), Bai Zhi (Angelica), and Lian Qiao to expel dampness.</p>
<p>Although these skin issues are minor, there are serious conditions like malignant sores, tinea, and scabies that can be highly bothersome, persisting for years without relief. Those suffering from such ailments should not rely exclusively on external medications; internal methods to dispel toxins should also be employed. Sheng Ma He Qi Yin, Xiao Du Yin, Si Shun Qing Liang Yin, and Xi Jiao Yin can all be utilized.</p>
<p>For sores resembling cowhide that are extremely itchy and also painful, use Huang Lian, Mu Xiang (Aucklandia), Huang Bo Pi (the bark), and two pieces of cedar wood, with a small amount of alum. Grind all the ingredients into a fine powder, mix with good quality oil, and apply; this will definitely be effective.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Itching</strong></p>
<p>There are different causes of itching: if it is due to scabies or ringworm, one should seek treatment according to the conditions of sores and scabs. For those with blood deficiency and dry skin leading to itching, it is advisable to use Si Wu Decoction with seven qian of Fang Feng; alternatively, one could use half a decoction of Si Wu, with two cups of water, and add one qian of Xiao Feng San to it. Women experiencing systemic itching or itching of the head and face, feeling as if insects are crawling under the skin, may have this condition triggered by wind during their menstrual period; otherwise, it could be caused by consuming wind-inducing substances during postpartum recovery. In such cases, the aforementioned Si Wu Decoction with Xiao Feng San is also recommended. For individuals with spleen deficiency experiencing itching, without any scabies or ringworm, and who are generally clean, this persistent itching should not be ignored as it is related to spleen deficiency. The classics state: all pains are due to excess, while all itches are due to deficiency. Additionally, it says: the spleen controls the muscles of the body. Therefore, it is important to strengthen the spleen first. A suitable remedy is the Four Beast Decoction devoid of herbs, adding half a qian each of Huo Xiang, Hou Po, Chuan Xiong, and Dang Gui; prepare with ginger and dates, and consume as a remedy named Zeng Sun Zi Wei Decoction.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of the Five Scab Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The five scab conditions involve dryness, dampness, insecticidal sand, and pus, arising from toxins accumulated in the five organs, predominantly affecting the foot&#39;s three yin meridians. The sores can spread across the body and are difficult to distinguish in terms of meridian connection, requiring external signs to determine deficiency or excess. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain, with constipation and hard stools, accompanied by fever, this indicates wind toxin damp-heat. If there is widespread swelling, itching, pain, and afternoon fever, or intermittently cold and hot, along with fatigue and reduced appetite, but smooth bowel movements, this suggests blood deficiency with wind-heat. </p>
<p>For dry scabies characterized by itching, dry skin flakes, and constipation, this is due to fire stagnation in the heart and liver affecting the lungs. Recommended treatments include four cooling beverages, Gu Jing Huang Decoction, or Su Feng Shun Qi Pill. For chronic cases, Tianmen Dong Paste should be used. For those with smooth bowel movements and ailments caused by fiery stagnation in the lungs, use Blood Activating Dryness-Nourishing drinks, or add Huang Qin and Lian Qiao to the Four Substance Decoction; for prolonged cases, consider Shen Qi Pill. For long-standing deficiency, Gu Wu Jing Pill is recommended. </p>
<p>If there is a pre-existing lung wind condition and many pimples on the face, use Birch Bark Powder.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Wet sores cause swelling and pain; if prolonged, the discharge resembles black bean juice, leading to constipation, which is due to dampness and heat toxins from the spleen. Use Fangfeng Tongsheng San, prepared with wine; or fry Da Huang, then cook it with wine three times, adding Mu Bie Zi; or use Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang with Tian Ma, Chan Tui, and Jing Jie, as well as Fu Yuan Tong Qi San. For those with excessive dampness, use Zhu Shi Dan. If there&#39;s ease in bowel movement, it indicates spleen deficiency and damp-heat; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, increasing Huang Qin to clear heat and Xiang Fu to dry dampness. For stomach fire causing thirst, use Zhu Ye Huang Qi Tang. For spleen stagnation with night sweats and inability to sleep, use Gui Pi Tang. For abdominal distension with difficult urination, use Wei Ling Tang with Huang Lian; for chronic cases, use Er Miao Cang Zhu Wan. If dampness is excessive, use Dan Cang Zhu Gao. For wind toxins in the spleen and lungs, use He Shou Wu San. </p>
<p>Sand sores appear like fine grains of sand, sometimes painful or itchy; scratching produces fluid and causes redness, indicating stagnation of heart blood. For constipation, use Gui Ban Wan or Liang Ge San combined with Si Wu Tang. For prolonged issues, use wine-steamed Huang Lian Wan.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>For those with a lot of phlegm in their chest, use Niuhuang Qingxin Pills. If there is restlessness, dry mouth, and difficulty urinating, use Lianqiao Decoction. If urination is normal, use Huoxue Siwu Decoction. For prolonged issues, use Danggui Decoction.  </p>
<p>When there is excessive heat leading to parasitic issues, it’s like decaying grass becoming fireflies. For itching caused by parasites, there is no pain, but it is easily transmitted. If there is constipation, it indicates severe Liver Wind Heat; in this case, use Aloe Pills or Baidu San, and apply powdered antelope horn juice. For prolonged conditions, use Gu Ku Zao Pills. If urination is normal but there are Liver qi stagnation and heat, use Xiaoyao San and apply powdered antelope horn juice. If it does not heal for a long time, use Huzhima San. However, for any sore that persists, it may lead to parasites, which also require external treatment and cleansing.  </p>
<p>If there is thick, foul-smelling discharge causing pain and constipation, it is due to damp-heat; in this case, use Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction, Sheng Ma Heqi Decoction, or Zhuye Shigao Decoction combined with Siwu Decoction.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If the discharge is a clear, pale fluid without pain and is easy to pass, it indicates kidney deficiency with excess fire. Treatment options include Ba Wei Xiao Yao San or Si Wu Tang modified with Zhi Mu and Huang Lian, or Si Sheng San or Shen Qi Wan. </p>
<p>In cases where the upper body often has wind-heat and the lower body has wind-damp, those who are overweight tend to have more wind-damp, while those who are thin are more prone to blood-heat. For the weak and emaciated with deficiency, dry kidney and fiery heat, even if there are symptoms like constipation, fever, and thirst, one should only nourish yin and reduce fire, with slight additions of Qin Jiao, Cang Er, and Lian Qiao. It is crucial not to use solely wind herbs that cool the blood and harm the stomach, as there are instances where skin diseases ruin the internal organs.</p>
<p>The general remedy is Lian Gui Tang. For qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Tang; for blood deficiency, combine with Si Wu Tang; for wind, combine with Xiao Du drink; for dampness, combine with Ping Wei San. </p>
<p>To unblock toxins and congestion, warm and spicy herbs like Wu Yu and Bai Zhi are necessary. To reduce muscle heat, bitter and cold herbs like Qin Lian and Da Huang are required. For killing parasites, mercury and similar substances should be used. This outlines the three external treatment methods of Dan Xi.</p>
<p>For dry scabies, use Wu Zhu Yu San; alternatively, make a powder of Huang Lian and Da Huang mixed with pig bile for topical application. For damp scabies, use Yi Shang San. For sand scabies, use Jian Cao San.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>For insect scabies, use sulfur ointment. For abscesses, apply Sanhuang powder. The Feng Gao (Wind Ointment) is commonly used. For washing medicine, prepare a decoction with equal parts of schizonepeta, berberine, and bitter flee beetle; if itching, add snake bed seeds and Sichuan pepper; if swollen, add scallions.</p>
<p>Scabies and ringworms are both caused by heat and dryness in the blood, resulting in wind-dampness attacking the skin. The superficial condition is scabies, while the deeper one is ringworm. Scabies tends to be associated with heat, while ringworm often carries dampness. Scabies can appear on hands, feet, and all over the body; ringworm is characterized by itchy, rash-like lesions on the muscles, which may be round or oblong, or spread like moss. Dry ringworm is also known as wind ringworm; scratching it produces white flakes. Wet ringworm resembles insect movement; scratching it yields a fluid. Chronic ringworm does not cause any pain or itching. Cow ringworm is thick and firm, similar to a cow&#39;s neck. Horse ringworm is slightly itchy with interconnected white spots, also referred to as dog ringworm.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The various wind, dampness, skin lesions, and scabies are largely the same. When they first arise, if they can be brought down, one should extract pus and mix Huanglian (Coptis), Jinyinhua (Honeysuckle), Chuanxiong (Sichuan Lovage), and Mangxiao (Natron), adding Chi Shao (Red Peony) and Bai Shao (White Peony). Boil with equal parts of water and wine, add Dahuang (Rhubarb) before it is fully cooked, let sit overnight, and take in the early morning. If there is sweating present, combine the Four Essentials Decoction with Jingjie (Schizonepeta) and Mahuang (Ephedra) each at five qian (a unit of weight), along with one liang (another unit of weight) of floating duckweed, and boil with scallions and beans to induce sweating. All forms of scabies and skin lesions respond to this. For those who have hesitated to induce sweating for a long time, use Fangfeng Tongsheng San (a formula for dispelling wind and clearing heat) without the natron and yellow, adding floating duckweed and Zaozi (Soapberry) and boil to take. For those who have not healed for years with a pronounced body condition, simultaneously swallow stubborn scabies pills or the ancient Longhu Dan, using He Shou Wu (Fo-Ti), Baizhi (Angelica Dahurica), and Sumu (Sandalwood) in equal parts, with a little pig fat and salt, and infuse in wine before swallowing. Those with a weak constitution should not carelessly take wind herbs. For those with qi deficiency, use He Shou Wu San (Fo-Ti Powder) or Xiaofeng San (Wind-Dissolving Powder). For those with dry blood, consider the Four Saints Longevity Pill or Shenqi Wan (Kidney Qi Pill). Long-term use can be effective. Those with parasites should intermittently take Wax Alumen Pills. For external treatment: for dry skin lesions, use Wolf Poison and Cao Wu (Aconite) each at two and a half qian, and seven live beetles, ground into powder and mixed with saliva to apply.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>For treating湿癣 (damp dermatitis), use five qian of burnet and rhubarb, and two qian each of talcum powder, yellow lead, and mercury, ground into a fine powder. Mix with two liang of pig lard oil, kneading until the mercury is fully dispersed. Store in an earthen jar for application.</p>
<p>For 牛癣 (cattle scab), burn the soles of old shoes to retain their essence, then grind with a small amount of light powder, using sesame oil as a paste for application.</p>
<p>For 马疥癣 (horse mange), take half a cup of the fresh juice of horsewhip grass, avoiding contact with iron, and drink it all. Recovery will occur within ten days.</p>
<p>The general remedy involves two liang of sesame oil, mixed with fourteen seeds each of croton and castor beans, and seven grasshoppers, simmered until blackened. Strain, then mix in five qian of white wax and three qian of aloe powder, stirring well and storing in an earthen jar for application on broken skin.</p>
<p>Alternatively, mash equal parts of mulberry bark, Zhejiang cutgrass, and fructus colocasiae into a powder and mix with vinegar for application.</p>
<p>For washing, use a decoction of perilla, camphor, bunya nuts, and duckweed.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The blood wind sore is caused by the accumulation of wind heat, fire, and blood dryness from the three yin channels. It is characterized by infrequent itching, breaking open to form sores, and oozing pus. There are internal symptoms such as afternoon heat, night sweats, aversion to cold, decreased appetite, and physical fatigue, which make one wary of using wind medications carelessly. For those with liver wind and painful blood dryness compounded by cold and heat, use Danggui decoction with Chaihu and山栀 (gardenia). For pain and itchiness combined with cold and heat, administer Xiao Chaihu decoction with山栀 and Huanglian. If there is night-time heat with irritability, use Xiao Chaihu decoction with Shengdi. For those with liver and spleen heat accumulation, accompanied by decreased appetite and cold and heat symptoms, apply Bawei Xiaoyao powder. For spleen deficiency with afternoon heat and night sweats affecting sleep, utilize Guipi decoction with山栀 and熟地 (reheated earth). In cases of kidney deficiency with heat causing thirst, cough, and phlegm, use Shenshu pill. General treatments: if widespread, apply Siwu decoction with floating duckweed and Huangqin in equal parts, and for severe cases, use Ziyunfeng pill, Huangu bone pill, or San She Dan. For pain and itching in both legs, use Danggui Nian Tong decoction. If itching all over occurs after drinking alcohol, leading to bleeding upon scratching and pain, mix Chanset and mint in equal parts into a powder, and take two qian mixed with water or wine. For any generalized itching, external treatments include Mo Feng ointment or Da Machi ointment.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case Notes</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Xue Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skin Sores and Scabies</strong></p>
<p>For itching or oozing sores, clear wind and eliminate dampness. For itching and pain without pus, expel wind and moisten dryness. If there is burning pain or symptoms of chills and fever, disperse the exterior. If itching or pain worsens in the afternoon, reduce heat and nourish yin. For burning pain with constipation, nourish yin and drain fire. For itching that causes white flakes and a buzzing sound in the ears, expel wind and clear heat. </p>
<p>Scabies is related to damp-heat accumulation in the spleen channel, or blood-heat and wind-heat in the liver channel, or yin deficiency heat in the kidney channel. Symptoms of fatigue and reduced appetite indicate spleen damp-heat, treated with the tonic for spleen qi. If pain arises from consuming cold substances, it reflects heat accumulation in the spleen, treated with heat-clearing and detoxifying powder. Itching and fevers suggest spleen deficiency with wind-heat, treated with ginseng to dispel wind powder. Itching with pain points to wind-heat, treated with angelica decoction. Constipation with pain indicates heat toxin, treated with s вangmua Combined Qi Decoction. If heat, thirst, and loose stools indicate spleen and lung deficiency heat, use bamboo leaf and astragalus decoction. Internal heat with afternoon heat, or intermittent chills and fever, pertains to liver channel blood deficiency with wind-heat, treated with modified free and easy wanderer powder or six-flavor pill. Symptoms of fatigue, reduced appetite, or night sweats and little sleep indicate stagnation of spleen qi, treated with modified return to spleen pill, free and easy wanderer powder, or rehmannia pill. If there are fever and night sweats, or dry cough and mouth dryness, this suggests kidney channel deficiency heat, treated with six-flavor pill decoction.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(By Wang Kengtang, Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Scabies and eczema arise from damp heat in the spleen channel and wind toxin in the lung channel, which afflict the skin. The superficial manifestation of wind toxin is scabies, while the deeper manifestation is eczema. Eczema occurs due to wind toxin from the lungs, while scabies also involves the damp heat of the spleen. If they persist without healing, they can spread over the whole body, leading to ulceration and varying sensations of itchiness or pain. Both conditions host minute parasites that can be transmitted to others. Scabies can be classified into five types: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Large scabies: characterized by burning redness, itching, pain, and the formation of pus-filled sores.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Horse scabies: marked by hidden lesions with roots that itch without pain when scratched.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Water scabies: featuring fluid-filled lesions that ooze when burst.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dry scabies: causes itching, leading to dry crusts on the skin when scratched.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wet scabies: presents with thin, small sores that frequently exude fluid.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The condition known as ringworm appears on the skin as rashes, which can be either round or oblique, resembling scattered moss. It contains liquid within and has a border externally. There are six types: </p>
</li>
<li><p>Dry ringworm, which produces white flakes when scratched, looks dull and withered;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wet ringworm, which oozes fluid when scratched, appearing as though infested by insects;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wind ringworm, which, when scratched, causes numbness without pain or itchiness;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cow ringworm, which resembles the tough and hard skin of a cow&#39;s neck;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dog ringworm, which causes slight itching and has connected white spots;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Knife ringworm, which has no distinct borders and appears irregularly shaped.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The treatment should involve applying medicinal substances that kill parasites, dispel moisture, and sterilize. Internally, take remedies that harmonize the spleen, clear the lungs, and eliminate wind and dampness to eradicate its root. Also, on the face, wind ringworm initially appears as small sores that can grow into finer wounds, causing pain and itchiness, and it commonly occurs in the spring, known as &quot;blossom ringworm,&quot; and is often seen in women.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>This condition is the result of an accumulation of wind in the lung pathways, with yang energy rising and manifesting in the facial area, often between the brows. If it persists for a long time without improvement, it may lead to wind-related diseases. The treatment should aim to clear the heart fire and disperse the wind heat from the lung pathways, and then apply medication to eliminate toxins and dispel heat, which will lead to natural recovery.</p>
<p>As Yan Zi Li said, although scabs and skin diseases may be distressing, they do not harm the person; however, many of them are indeed difficult to treat. The Suwen states that all painful and itchy sores belong to the heart. Most arise from stagnant heart energy or irregularities in diet, which accumulate toxins in the intestines and stomach, leading to manifestations on the skin. There are ancient remedies for various types of skin conditions, such as horse scabs, water scabs, dry scabs, and moist scabs, each differing in type. They may arise on the hands and feet or affect the whole body, causing itching, pain, heat, swelling, skin dimpling, raised areas from scratching, or oozing pus. The treatment should focus on internally regulating heart blood and dispersing wind heat, while externally applying washes and ointments, ensuring there will be no cases that do not heal.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The conditions of scabs and itchiness are all caused by wind and heat, resulting in itching all over the body. Scratching causes the skin to rise, sometimes leading to bleeding or fluid discharge, forming dry scabs that may contain parasites. Often, people will use a needle to pick them out, resembling water bugs. This is fundamentally due to the deep invasion of wind and heat into the muscle layers.</p>
<p>Dry scabies lead to raised dry scabs from scratching, indicating that wind and heat are deeply rooted within the muscles. </p>
<p>Wet scabies manifest as small sores on the skin, with yellow fluid constantly oozing, indicating that the wind, heat, and toxic gases have penetrated the skin.</p>
<p>As for sores, these arise from the weakness of the pores, allowing wind and moisture to invade the blood and become congested. They frequently appear on the hands and feet, appearing in succession like newly sprouted fruits. They cause pain and itchiness, leading to scratching that results in sores and yellow fluid discharge. Over time, they spread and grow, occasionally healing and then reappearing, leading to the development of parasites. Thus, they are termed sores.</p>
<p>Sores that persist without healing are caused by the weakness of the skin&#39;s pores, which allows wind and moisture to become stagnant. When parasites grow between the muscles, they cause ongoing itchiness and pain, hence they remain unhealed for a long time.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The &quot;Treatise on the Origin of Diseases&quot; states: The appearance of ringworm resembles the pattern of coins, gradually growing, sometimes round or slanted, with itching and pain having a defined boundary. The ringworm contains worms that produce moisture when scratched; this results from wind and dampness obstructing the pores, combined with cold dampness clashing with blood qi; when blood qi is congested, this disease arises.</p>
<p>Wind ringworm is caused by malevolent wind and cold air invading the skin, arising from the weakness of blood qi. It also appears as circular patterns with defined boundaries, yet scratching causes numbness without pain or itch, and there are also worms present.</p>
<p>There is also a condition known as &quot;escaping wind sores,&quot; which appears all over the body, resembling ringworm or scabies with itching. This arises from wind energy escaping onto the skin, thus named escaping wind sores.</p>
<p>Dry ringworm appears only as defined boundaries, with dry and itchy skin. Scratching causes white flakes to appear. This is also due to wind and dampness obstructing the pores, combined with cold dampness and blood qi clashing. The condition ultimately shows more wind poison and less dampness; since the wind penetrates deeply, there is no moisture, leading to dry ringworm, which also contains worms.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is white ringworm, characterized by a white color and itching. This results from a deficiency in the pores allowing wind to enter, where wind and qi are combined, and the blood is stagnated, failing to nourish the muscles.</p>
<p>Damp ringworm also has defined boundaries, resembling the movement of worms, with red dampness and itching, producing lesions when scratched due to excessive moisture. This indicates shallow wind poison and an excess of dampness resulting in damp ringworm, which also contains worms.</p>
<p>If ringworm appears between the neck and extends up to the ears, forming damp ringworm that does not respond to other treatments, one can mix one ounce of aloe and half an ounce of licorice powder evenly, washing the ringworm first with warm strained water, drying it, and applying the mixture, which is remarkably effective.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>Soaking Ulcer</h3>
<p>Soaking ulcers, when scratched shallowly, spread and do not stop growing. The itching resembles scabies; scratching causes fluid to form and connect. Zhongjing says: If it flows from the mouth to the limbs, it can be treated; if it flows from the limbs into the mouth, it cannot be treated. When the qi is soaked, it is all related to fire. The classic states: If the fire of the year exceeds, it can cause body heat and skin soaking.</p>
<h3>Scabies</h3>
<p>Scabies is a disease of minute bumps. When it appears, it causes incessant scratching, but one may not know how it arises. Scabies says: I do not have roots to grow nor a mother to be formed; I rely on the balance of yin and yang, with dampness and heat shaping me. I usually manifest on the hands of nobles but also cling to the bodies of commoners, capable of making scholars put down their pens and embroiderers stop their needles, indifferent to status, equally affecting all. The doctor inquired: If it doesn’t arise on the body and only attacks the hands, what then? Scabies responded: The palm is governed by the damp earth of Taiyin, while the center of the hand is overseen by the fire of Shaoyang. Earth can generate me, and fire can transform me. Thus, my existence relies on the transformation of damp earth and yang fire, so I must emerge from the palm. The doctor replied: Indeed! However, its form knows movement but not stillness; it can advance but cannot retreat, and it is not transformed by clear qi.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The spleen is responsible for digestion and assimilation, while the stomach governs transformation and transportation. In human consumption, there is no one who does not enjoy rich flavors. Among these rich flavors, dampness and heat combine, leading to the formation of sores. Furthermore, clear energy follows the pulse and circulates, while turbid energy lingers and does not disperse, settling on the skin. When this stagnation persists over time, it leads to heat and itching. Thus, in the midst of itching and heat, damp fire can transform into insects, with their form following the moisture and their movement arising from the heat—this is senseless yet sentient. After transformation, these conditions conceal beneath the skin, and they can shift and attack, causing itching and stabbing sensations, perpetuating a cycle of transformation and proliferation that spreads throughout the body. When close to the surface, it can turn into scabies; if prolonged, it can evolve into stubborn wind, often resulting in dry and withered skin that invades the blood vessels, causing relentless itching, which can be relieved by herbal decoctions. Externally, using an ointment made of round balls can help stop itching and eliminate insects; internally, taking a wind-dispelling powder can also disperse wind and cool the blood. It is essential to avoid rich and spicy flavors; avoid hot soups, as these can aggravate the condition.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Persistent dermatitis is caused by a combination of wind, heat, moisture, and insects. It manifests in various sizes and shapes, both dry and wet, and can be new or old. Wind dermatitis resembles clouds; the skin is delicate, and scratching produces white flakes. Moist dermatitis resembles insect activity; scratching yields a fluid. Persistent dermatitis causes no pain at all when scratched. Psoriasis resembles the skin of a cow&#39;s neck, being tough and hard, with scratching feeling like decayed wood. Horse dermatitis is slightly itchy, with white spots connected. Dog dermatitis has clusters of white patches. All these conditions are the result of blood dryness and toxic wind, affecting the spleen and lungs. For initial symptoms, use a wind-dispersing powder with one tael of duckweed, mixed with scallions and soybeans to induce sweating. For long-standing cases, take folk remedies like He Shou Wu pills or wax alum pills. For external treatment, apply a remedy of yellow earth and induce dispersion with Hibiscus skin powder; choose accordingly and results will gradually appear.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescriptions for Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty, Chen Tuduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For treating sores and scabies, use 250 grams of cocklebur, 200 grams of苦参 (kǔ shēn), 30 grams each of fresh licorice, honeysuckle, catnip, and windbreak herb, along with 150 grams of fresh astragalus. Boil them in a large pot of water. While hot, use the steam for fumigation; then wrap the body with two mats and cover with clothes to keep the heat in. Wait until it&#39;s slightly cooled for a bath, and it must continue until there is thirst and cold before stopping. Repeat the bath the next day, re-boiling the residue as before for three days, and the sores and scabies will surely heal.</p>
<p>For scabies, no need for decoctions; instead, use 3 grams each of light powder, perilla leaf powder, and windbreak herb powder, along with 9 grams of walnut meat (with oil) and 9 grams of pig lard, plus 6 grams of white mustards, and grind into balls the size of a marble. Apply to the affected areas, and healing will occur in one day.</p>
<p>For yellow water sores: wherever toxic water flows in, it causes large blisters, known as yellow water sores. They easily rupture with slight movement, indicating that heat poison is trapped in the skin. Wash them with decoctions until healed. The recipe includes 25 grams each of realgar and windbreak herb, boiled in 10 bowls of water; strain and use to wash the sores, ensuring healing.</p>
<p>Treating stubborn ringworm is also easy. Use equal amounts (30 grams) of tree of heaven bark, white mustards, and rhubarb root, along with 9 grams each of light powder and desiccated snail, and 3 grams each of borneol and fresh licorice. Grind these into fine powder, first crush the ringworm skin with lychee shells, then mix this medicinal powder with sesame oil and apply.

<li><p>For an effective ringworm remedy: Half a tael of broomcorn root and two and a half qian of light powder; grind into a fine powder, mix with cool water, and apply to ringworm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For chronic ringworm and scabies: Take fresh sheep hoof roots, crush and extract juice, mix with a small amount of fat to form a paste and apply to the affected area. Repeat three to five times until healed. If too dry, use pig fat to adjust and apply. Additionally, another remedy: use the white juice from mulberry branches and apply to ringworm for excellent results.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Treatment for ringworm and skin itchiness: Use half a pound of paper mulberry leaves, finely chopped and pounded, then apply to the affected area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For various types of sores and ringworm: Fry leek roots until almost burnt, then pound into a powder, mixing with pig fat to apply; it will heal in three to five treatments.</p>
<p>To treat all kinds of ringworm: Use pinellia powder. Take three taels of pinellia, pound into a fine powder, mix with aged soy sauce to make a paste, and apply to the ringworm two to three times a day until healed.</p>
<p>For ringworm sores: Take toad and burn it into powder, mixing with pig fat for application.</p>
<p>If the sore resembles cowhide, is extremely itchy, and painful: Use equal parts of huanglian, muxiang, huangbo bark, and two segments of cedar wood, with a bit of alum, all ground into powder. Mix with high-quality fragrant oil to apply; it is very effective. </p>
<p>Another method: On the fifth day of the fifth month, take ten frogs, mix with half a cash of musk, grind into a fine powder, and apply with vinegar to the ringworm; this will yield a small amount of yellow fluid and help heal.</p>
<p>Another method: Take two pieces of fresh black aconite and five dried scorpions, grind them into a fine powder, and mix with oil to make an ointment for application.</p>
<p>There are individuals suffering from widespread hot toxic sores, painful but not itchy, especially on the hands and feet, stopping at the neck, sticking to clothing and bedding, preventing sleep day and night, and causing unbearable pain. There’s a method recommended involving three bushels of sweet flag, dried in the sun, ground into powder, then spread on a mat for the person with sores to lie on, covering with clothing and bedding; this prevents sticking to the clothes and allows for sleep. Within five or seven days, the sores will visibly improve, demonstrating miraculous effects.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>Scabies: Take the root of the chinaberry tree, peel it, and cut it into pieces, then mix with the depulped soapberry in equal parts. Strain and combine with lard, and apply to the scabies after scratching and removing the scabs to protect against wind. Do not let women or dogs see it.</p>
<p>For wet scabies, which have festered for a long time and are unbearably itchy, scratching causes yellow fluid to seep out, and once healed, it can recur: Take the root of shepherd’s purse, peel and finely cut it, then cook it thoroughly, mixing with vinegar. First, wash the affected area and apply for a time, then rinse with cold water. Apply daily for healing. If used as a powder instead, it is even better. Use raw cloth to rub against the ringworm before applying medicine, being careful not to touch healthy flesh to avoid toxicity.</p>
<p>For sand sores: Use the ashes of water lettuce burned to preserve their potency, and mix with fragrant oil for rapid healing; if wet, apply dry. Another prescription: Take a handful of fresh leeks, chop and grind, mix with five parts warm vinegar, soak for a long time, strain the juice with cloth, and apply to the sores three to four times a day.</p>
<p>For dry and wet scabies and ringworm: Take white scallions with the roots, mix with pig fat, and mash to apply. Another prescription: Take seven and a half qian each of fried dragon liver and mixed hair, grind to powder, and mix with pig fat for application. Another prescription: Mix chicken comb blood with powdered Coptis and apply.</p>
<p>For fragrant petal sores: This treats sores near the face and ears that have festered and are discharging yellow fluid, lingering without healing. Take two qian each of goat hair, schizonepeta, and dried jujubes (with pits removed). Burn to ash to preserve potency, grind uniformly, and add half a qian of fine flour, mix thoroughly. Use a small amount each time, mixing with sesame oil for application. First, wash well with warm water and dry, applying the medicine two to three times will yield results. It also treats sores that arise from the lips.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If one develops a soaking sore and does not treat it early, it can encircle the body and may prove fatal. &quot;External Treatments&quot; states that soaking sores can spread widely, are moist, and often arise from the heart. Use a male chicken comb to pierce and draw blood, applying it three to five times a day. It also treats dry skin diseases that cause itching.</p>
<p>Soaking sores are unbearably painful and can cause fever: use thistle powder mixed with water to apply on the sore, changing it when it dries. Another remedy: one three-inch crucian carp, one measure of fermented soybeans, ground into a paste for application. This also treats saddle sores. Yet another remedy: one ounce of bitter gourd, half an ounce of burnt snake skin, half an ounce of lightly roasted wasp nest, powdered dust from beams, mixed with oil for application.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Classic&quot; states that scabies and skin diseases are treated with Yangxi. The &quot;Medical Comprehensive Outline&quot; states for hand scabies, use moxibustion on Laogong and Daling points. For sores and stubborn skin diseases, apply to the Absolute Bone and Sanli points each one and a half inches deep; also to the Jiankang and Xiexu points five fen deep; and to the Blood Cave three inches deep. </p>
<p>For sores and scabies all over the body, apply at Qu Pool, Hegu, Sanli, Absolute Bone, Xingjian, and Weizhong points. The &quot;Sure Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: for moxibustion, during noon time, apply three sticks of moxa to the shadow of the affected area. While doing this, recite: &quot;The bugs in the scabs, black and rough, if one wishes to treat, wait until noon.&quot; Another method: on the first day of the eighth month, at sunrise, have the patient kneel facing east in a room, hold their hands up on both sides of the chest, and moxibustion on the small shoulder bone just below the shoulder joint, applying two fires, three or seven bunches each, will heal in ten days.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Study</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;The Confucian Gate on Serving Parents,&quot; it is said that a man named Huo Shengyao approached to buy苦参 (Ku Shen) to treat scabies. He did not understand the properties of the medicine but only heard it could be effective. He brewed a strong decoction and took a bowl, soon after which he vomited a basinful of saliva, and within two or three days, the scabies developed scabs.</p>
<p>A girl, fifteen years old, had wet eczema between her thighs, three to four inches long, extending down to her knees. It was so itchy that she scratched it, yet neither hot nor cold treatments provided relief. When the itching subsided, yellowish-red fluid flowed, and the pain was unbearable. Moxibustion, fumigation, and medications such as sulfur, (艹闾) grass, white silkworms, and sheep&#39;s hoof root did not work. The girl was beautiful, but due to this illness, she could not get married, prompting her parents to seek treatment from a doctor named Dai. He said, &quot;If you can follow my instructions, you will recover.&quot; The parents agreed. Dai used a needle ground to a sharp point and instructed that, during the itching, he would prick over a hundred spots on the eczema, allowing all the blood to flow out. After washing with boiled salt water, he repeated this process four times, and only then was the severe illness resolved. This method is not recorded to inform later generations, fearing it might be misused in the treatment of eczema. The dampness mingling with blood must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>A ten-year-old boy from Caizhai had been suffering from extensive abdominal eczema for over a year; each time he scratched, yellow fluid oozed out. Doctor Dai first made pills from bitter melon stems, and after administration, the symptoms subsided. He then gave him the Zhouche pills and Jun Chuan powder in three to five doses. Lastly, he administered Liang Ge San combined with (石卜) nitrate, and after brewing it to sip at intervals, the boy was cured within a few days.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Yinggao Han Jiqing experienced damp sores on his feet, with larger ones resembling coins and smaller ones like beans. They itched, causing him to scratch, and when moisture accumulated, they became saturated. They appeared like insects crawling in his socks and, once healed, would reappear, leaving depressions as scars, persisting for over ten years. A man laughed at him, saying, &quot;These are damp sores, arising from moisture and thus often found on the feet.&quot; After traveling by boat and cart and undertaking deep river work for over ten days, they vanished like sweeping away dust.</p>
<p>In &quot;Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Records,&quot; it is noted that a woman suffered from itchy sores with constant pus, her pulse was floating and weak. After taking four doses of Xiaofengsan, she was slightly better, and taking Shisanshi Wan for over a month, she was stable. </p>
<p>A man had itching with more pain and no pus; he was treated with Qìn, Lián, Jīng, Fáng, Shān Zhī, Bò Hé, Sháo Yào, and Guī Shāo, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>Another man suffered from burning pain and fever, with a floating and rapid pulse. After four doses of Rénshēn Baidú San, he was slightly better, and after several doses of Dāngguī Yǐnzi, he recovered. </p>
<p>A man had burning pain with alternating chills and fever, constipation, and a rapid and strong pulse. He took three doses of Fángfēng Tōngshèng San, resulting in slight improvement, and subsequently took four doses of Jīng Fáng Baidú San with added Qīn and Shān Zhī, leading to his recovery. </p>
<p>A woman experienced itching, especially worse in the afternoon. After several doses of Dāngguī Yǐnzi, she felt slightly better, and a few doses of Rénshēn Jīngjiè San helped her feel calm. </p>
<p>Lastly, a man had not recovered for a long time, scratching led to white flakes, and he heard a cicada-like sound in his ears. After taking Shisanshi San several times, the itching stopped, and several doses of Dāngguī Yǐnzi led to his healing.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>A man experienced discomfort in his lower body, with pain worsening in the afternoon. His legs and ankles were swollen and purple, so blood was extracted from the purple areas. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus Huangqin and Lian for four doses, and he found relief. If the issue were in the upper body, such as purple swelling in the arms or ankles, blood should also be extracted from those areas, and the previous decoction with Chaihu and Huangqin would ensure recovery.</p>
<p>One man developed itchy sores, with severe pain during the afternoon. This condition was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus Huangqin, Lian, Jing, and Fang for several doses until the pain ceased. He was then given Si Wu Decoction with Jizhu, He Shou Wu, and Huangqi for twenty doses until he fully recovered. A scholar named Li Longgang suffered from this ailment all over his body, especially in his legs and feet, with worsening pain in the afternoon, dry mouth, and frequent red urination. This was diagnosed as a deficiency of the kidney channel with heat; he was treated with the Six Flavors Pill for recovery.</p>
<p>A scholar had issues in his arms and feet that itched or swelled in the afternoon, causing fatigue. He took Baidu San on his own, but the pain intensified and his urination became red and thin. This indicated a deficiency of lung and kidney yin; he was treated with a restorative decoction with Shiwuzi and Mai Men Dong for recovery.</p>
<p>Another scholar mistakenly used aggressive treatments, which left him with a weakened vital energy and unable to heal. He was treated with a restorative decoction plus Poria, and his sores healed immediately. However, due to improper care, the condition worsened in the afternoon, necessitating over fifty doses of an Eight Treasure Decoction with Shiwuzi and Mai Men Dong for full recovery.</p>
<p>A man had darkened, itchy skin and expelled black blood, with worsening symptoms in the afternoon. His legs swelled during the day and subsided at night, which I attributed to a deficiency of qi and blood along with heat. He was given a restorative decoction in the morning and a modified Xiaoyao San in the evening, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>A man, after recovering from an epidemic disease, showed symptoms of his ailment. He used the previous medicine for nourishment and became well. Another patient with the same illness used the method of acupuncture, bled, and died. This was due to a deficiency of Yin and heat in the blood, manifesting as black and itchy skin. How could this result in harming Yin and blood?</p>
<p>A woman who had long been unwell, with little appetite and fatigue, suffered from a deficiency of the liver and spleen, along with false heat. She first used a tonifying formula, the &quot;Renowned Tonifying Qi Decoction,&quot; with added Chuanxiong and pan-fried Gardenia fruit. Her vital energy gradually recovered, and then she took the &quot;Xiaoyao Powder,&quot; leading to gradual healing of her sores. If at night she exhibited a spurious speech, this indicated heat entering the blood aspect, treated with &quot;Xiaochaihu Decoction&quot; and addition of fresh Rehmannia. For those with blood deficiency, a mixture of &quot;Four Substance Decoction&quot; and &quot;Xiaochaihu Decoction&quot; is administered. Once heat subsides, use &quot;Xiaoyao Powder&quot; to nourish the spleen and stomach, producing Yin and blood. There are also cases of alternating chills and fever, which should be treated with the previous medicines.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Treatise&quot; states: A monk from Zhihua Temple suffered from sores and scabs. He used arsenic sulfide and mugwort leaves as medicine, burning them under the bedding for fumigation. The next day, his whole body swelled with blisters; the skin broke and oozed water. He could not eat or drink, and when I offered a remedy, the medicine failed to take effect, leading to death. The poison from the medicine entered his abdomen and dispersed the true Qi; thus, the resulting calamity.</p>
<p>A scholar skilled in sneezing suffered from itchiness. I suspected that damp heat was present within, and the pores were not tightly sealed, allowing external pathogens to afflict him. I recommended the &quot;Renowned Tonifying Qi Decoction&quot; with added Angelica dahurica and Chuanxiong, but he did not follow my advice. Instead, he self-administered &quot;Jingfang Baidu Powder,&quot; which caused night sweats and fever, and prompted thirst and burning pain, with pus and water oozing. He continued with the previous decoction, doubling the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, and Schisandra, and eventually achieved recovery.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Medication Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>For pus-filled abscesses, focus on treating heat and dryness with unnamed herbs. For dry skin diseases, prioritize relieving stagnation using evodia. For parasitic sores resembling ringworm, focus on reducing heat and eliminating parasites with herbs like pigweed, black dog spine, white alum, realgar, sulfur, and mercury. For exterminating parasites, use camphor and rosin, applying more to the scalp; for itching and parasite elimination, utilize coptis, calcite, and cnidium. Pine bark charcoal is essential for pus. If there is significant swelling, add angelica to relieve stagnation; if there is considerable pain, add angelica and calcite; if there are many parasites, add rhubarb and toad; if itching is intense, add dried alum; for scrotal sores, include evodia; if dampness is prevalent, adjust with fragrant oil. For severe itching and bleeding, incorporate rhubarb and coptis, mixed with pig&#39;s fat. For red conditions, add yellow lead; for blue conditions, add indigo; for a significant parasite presence, add tin ash, pigweed, and areca nut. For upper body issues, frequently use Tongsheng Powder, while for lower body issues, more purgatives are required. If there is swelling and bleeding in the feet, separate treatments for dampness and heat should be utilized. There are three types of sores: pus-filled blisters primarily treat heat.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment of Various Skin Sores</h3>
<p>In spring, when sores and scabs occur, it is advisable to focus on relieving emotional stagnation, rather than scratching or applying dressings. For unbearable pain from sores, use bitter-cold herbs combined with Huang Lian (Coptis) and Huang Qin (Scutellaria). Pay attention to using them based on the location of the symptoms and use channel-invigorating herbs as needed. It is said that for various sores, use Dang Gui (Angelica) and Huang Lian as the primary herbs, while Lian Qiao (Forsythia), Gan Cao (Licorice), and Huang Qin act as assistants. </p>
<p>Sores characterized by pain and itching are associated with heat. If the individual is robust, employ Si Wu Tang (Four Substances Decoction) with an addition of Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction). In cases where an impatient, dark, thin, heaty person suffers pain due to sores, they should use Si Wu Tang with Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Da Li Zi (large seed), and Gan Cao, adding Huang Bo (Phellodendron) if the sores are below. For individuals who are overweight and experience pain, attributed to damp-heat, use Fang Feng (Siler), Jing Jie (Schizonepeta), Bai Zhi (Angelica), and Lian Qiao to expel dampness.</p>
<p>Although these skin issues are minor, there are serious conditions like malignant sores, tinea, and scabies that can be highly bothersome, persisting for years without relief. Those suffering from such ailments should not rely exclusively on external medications; internal methods to dispel toxins should also be employed. Sheng Ma He Qi Yin, Xiao Du Yin, Si Shun Qing Liang Yin, and Xi Jiao Yin can all be utilized.</p>
<p>For sores resembling cowhide that are extremely itchy and also painful, use Huang Lian, Mu Xiang (Aucklandia), Huang Bo Pi (the bark), and two pieces of cedar wood, with a small amount of alum. Grind all the ingredients into a fine powder, mix with good quality oil, and apply; this will definitely be effective.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Itching</strong></p>
<p>There are different causes of itching: if it is due to scabies or ringworm, one should seek treatment according to the conditions of sores and scabs. For those with blood deficiency and dry skin leading to itching, it is advisable to use Si Wu Decoction with seven qian of Fang Feng; alternatively, one could use half a decoction of Si Wu, with two cups of water, and add one qian of Xiao Feng San to it. Women experiencing systemic itching or itching of the head and face, feeling as if insects are crawling under the skin, may have this condition triggered by wind during their menstrual period; otherwise, it could be caused by consuming wind-inducing substances during postpartum recovery. In such cases, the aforementioned Si Wu Decoction with Xiao Feng San is also recommended. For individuals with spleen deficiency experiencing itching, without any scabies or ringworm, and who are generally clean, this persistent itching should not be ignored as it is related to spleen deficiency. The classics state: all pains are due to excess, while all itches are due to deficiency. Additionally, it says: the spleen controls the muscles of the body. Therefore, it is important to strengthen the spleen first. A suitable remedy is the Four Beast Decoction devoid of herbs, adding half a qian each of Huo Xiang, Hou Po, Chuan Xiong, and Dang Gui; prepare with ginger and dates, and consume as a remedy named Zeng Sun Zi Wei Decoction.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment of the Five Scab Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The five scab conditions involve dryness, dampness, insecticidal sand, and pus, arising from toxins accumulated in the five organs, predominantly affecting the foot&#39;s three yin meridians. The sores can spread across the body and are difficult to distinguish in terms of meridian connection, requiring external signs to determine deficiency or excess. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain, with constipation and hard stools, accompanied by fever, this indicates wind toxin damp-heat. If there is widespread swelling, itching, pain, and afternoon fever, or intermittently cold and hot, along with fatigue and reduced appetite, but smooth bowel movements, this suggests blood deficiency with wind-heat. </p>
<p>For dry scabies characterized by itching, dry skin flakes, and constipation, this is due to fire stagnation in the heart and liver affecting the lungs. Recommended treatments include four cooling beverages, Gu Jing Huang Decoction, or Su Feng Shun Qi Pill. For chronic cases, Tianmen Dong Paste should be used. For those with smooth bowel movements and ailments caused by fiery stagnation in the lungs, use Blood Activating Dryness-Nourishing drinks, or add Huang Qin and Lian Qiao to the Four Substance Decoction; for prolonged cases, consider Shen Qi Pill. For long-standing deficiency, Gu Wu Jing Pill is recommended. </p>

For the weak and emaciated with deficiency, dry kidney and fiery heat, even if there are symptoms like constipation, fever, and thirst, one should only nourish yin and reduce fire, with slight additions of Qin Jiao, Cang Er, and Lian Qiao. It is crucial not to use solely wind herbs that cool the blood and harm the stomach, as there are instances where skin diseases ruin the internal organs.</p>

<p>Scabies and ringworms are both caused by heat and dryness in the blood, resulting in wind-dampness attacking the skin. The superficial condition is scabies, while the deeper one is ringworm. Scabies tends to be associated with heat, while ringworm often carries dampness. Scabies can appear on hands, feet, and all over the body; ringworm is characterized by itchy, rash-like lesions on the muscles, which may be round or oblong, or spread like moss. Dry ringworm is also known as wind ringworm; scratching it produces white flakes. Wet ringworm resembles insect movement; scratching it yields a fluid. Chronic ringworm does not cause any pain or itching. Cow ringworm is thick and firm, similar to a cow&#39;s neck. Horse ringworm is slightly itchy with interconnected white spots, also referred to as dog ringworm.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>For itching or oozing sores, clear wind and eliminate dampness. For itching and pain without pus, expel wind and moisten dryness. If there is burning pain or symptoms of chills and fever, disperse the exterior. If itching or pain worsens in the afternoon, reduce heat and nourish yin.

<p>Scabies is related to damp-heat accumulation in the spleen channel, or blood-heat and wind-heat in the liver channel, or yin deficiency heat in the kidney channel. Symptoms of fatigue and reduced appetite indicate spleen damp-heat, treated with the tonic for spleen qi. If pain arises from consuming cold substances, it reflects heat accumulation in the spleen, treated with heat-clearing and detoxifying powder. Itching and fevers suggest spleen deficiency with wind-heat, treated with ginseng to dispel wind powder. Itching with pain points to wind-heat, treated with angelica decoction. Constipation with pain indicates heat toxin, treated with s вangmua Combined Qi Decoction. If heat, thirst, and loose stools indicate spleen and lung deficiency heat, use bamboo leaf and astragalus decoction. Internal heat with afternoon heat, or intermittent chills and fever, pertains to liver channel blood deficiency with wind-heat, treated with modified free and easy wanderer powder or six-flavor pill. Symptoms of fatigue, reduced appetite, or night sweats and little sleep indicate stagnation of spleen qi, treated with modified return to spleen pill, free and easy wanderer powder, or rehmannia pill.

<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Scabies and eczema arise from damp heat in the spleen channel and wind toxin in the lung channel, which afflict the skin. The superficial manifestation of wind toxin is scabies, while the deeper manifestation is eczema. Eczema occurs due to wind toxin from the lungs, while scabies also involves the damp heat of the spleen. If they persist without healing, they can spread over the whole body, leading to ulceration and varying sensations of itchiness or pain. Both conditions host minute parasites that can be transmitted to others. Scabies can be classified into five types: </p>
<ol>
<li>Large scabies: characterized by burning redness, itching, pain, and the formation of pus-filled sores.</li>
<li>Horse scabies: marked by hidden lesions with roots that itch without pain when scratched.</li>
<li>Water scabies: featuring fluid-filled lesions that ooze when burst.</li>
<li>Dry scabies: causes itching, leading to dry crusts on the skin when scratched.</li>
<li>Wet scabies: presents with thin, small sores that frequently exude fluid.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition known as ringworm appears on the skin as rashes, which can be either round or oblique, resembling scattered moss. It contains liquid within and has a border externally. There are six types: </p>
<ol>
<li>Dry ringworm, which produces white flakes when scratched, looks dull and withered;</li>
<li>Wet ringworm, which oozes fluid when scratched, appearing as though infested by insects;</li>
<li>Wind ringworm, which, when scratched, causes numbness without pain or itchiness;</li>
<li>Cow ringworm, which resembles the tough and hard skin of a cow&#39;s neck;</li>
<li>Dog ringworm, which causes slight itching and has connected white spots;</li>
<li>Knife ringworm, which has no distinct borders and appears irregularly shaped.</li>
</ol>
<p>The treatment should involve applying medicinal substances that kill parasites, dispel moisture, and sterilize. Internally, take remedies that harmonize the spleen, clear the lungs, and eliminate wind and dampness to eradicate its root. Also, on the face, wind ringworm initially appears as small sores that can grow into finer wounds, causing pain and itchiness, and it commonly occurs in the spring, known as &quot;blossom ringworm,&quot; and is often seen in women.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This condition is the result of an accumulation of wind in the lung pathways, with yang energy rising and manifesting in the facial area, often between the brows. If it persists for a long time without improvement, it may lead to wind-related diseases. The treatment should aim to clear the heart fire and disperse the wind heat from the lung pathways, and then apply medication to eliminate toxins and dispel heat, which will lead to natural recovery.</p>
<p>As Yan Zi Li said, although scabs and skin diseases may be distressing, they do not harm the person; however, many of them are indeed difficult to treat. The Suwen states that all painful and itchy sores belong to the heart. Most arise from stagnant heart energy or irregularities in diet, which accumulate toxins in the intestines and stomach, leading to manifestations on the skin. There are ancient remedies for various types of skin conditions, such as horse scabs, water scabs, dry scabs, and moist scabs, each differing in type. They may arise on the hands and feet or affect the whole body, causing itching, pain, heat, swelling, skin dimpling, raised areas from scratching, or oozing pus. The treatment should focus on internally regulating heart blood and dispersing wind heat, while externally applying washes and ointments, ensuring there will be no cases that do not heal.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The conditions of scabs and itchiness are all caused by wind and heat, resulting in itching all over the body. Scratching causes the skin to rise, sometimes leading to bleeding or fluid discharge, forming dry scabs that may contain parasites. Often, people will use a needle to pick them out, resembling water bugs. This is fundamentally due to the deep invasion of wind and heat into the muscle layers.</p>
<p>Dry scabies lead to raised dry scabs from scratching, indicating that wind and heat are deeply rooted within the muscles. </p>
<p>Wet scabies manifest as small sores on the skin, with yellow fluid constantly oozing, indicating that the wind, heat, and toxic gases have penetrated the skin.</p>
<p>As for sores, these arise from the weakness of the pores, allowing wind and moisture to invade the blood and become congested. They frequently appear on the hands and feet, appearing in succession like newly sprouted fruits. They cause pain and itchiness, leading to scratching that results in sores and yellow fluid discharge. Over time, they spread and grow, occasionally healing and then reappearing, leading to the development of parasites. Thus, they are termed sores.</p>
<p>Sores that persist without healing are caused by the weakness of the skin&#39;s pores, which allows wind and moisture to become stagnant. When parasites grow between the muscles, they cause ongoing itchiness and pain, hence they remain unhealed for a long time.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Treatise on the Origin of Diseases&quot; states: The appearance of ringworm resembles the pattern of coins, gradually growing, sometimes round or slanted, with itching and pain having a defined boundary. The ringworm contains worms that produce moisture when scratched; this results from wind and dampness obstructing the pores, combined with cold dampness clashing with blood qi; when blood qi is congested, this disease arises.</p>
<p>Wind ringworm is caused by malevolent wind and cold air invading the skin, arising from the weakness of blood qi. It also appears as circular patterns with defined boundaries, yet scratching causes numbness without pain or itch, and there are also worms present.</p>
<p>There is also a condition known as &quot;escaping wind sores,&quot; which appears all over the body, resembling ringworm or scabies with itching. This arises from wind energy escaping onto the skin, thus named escaping wind sores.</p>
<p>Dry ringworm appears only as defined boundaries, with dry and itchy skin. Scratching causes white flakes to appear. This is also due to wind and dampness obstructing the pores, combined with cold dampness and blood qi clashing. The condition ultimately shows more wind poison and less dampness; since the wind penetrates deeply, there is no moisture, leading to dry ringworm, which also contains worms.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is white ringworm, characterized by a white color and itching. This results from a deficiency in the pores allowing wind to enter, where wind and qi are combined, and the blood is stagnated, failing to nourish the muscles.</p>
<p>Damp ringworm also has defined boundaries, resembling the movement of worms, with red dampness and itching, producing lesions when scratched due to excessive moisture. This indicates shallow wind poison and an excess of dampness resulting in damp ringworm, which also contains worms.</p>
<p>If ringworm appears between the neck and extends up to the ears, forming damp ringworm that does not respond to other treatments, one can mix one ounce of aloe and half an ounce of licorice powder evenly, washing the ringworm first with warm strained water, drying it, and applying the mixture, which is remarkably effective.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Soaking Ulcer</h3>
<p>Soaking ulcers, when scratched shallowly, spread and do not stop growing. The itching resembles scabies; scratching causes fluid to form and connect. Zhongjing says: If it flows from the mouth to the limbs, it can be treated; if it flows from the limbs into the mouth, it cannot be treated. When the qi is soaked, it is all related to fire. The classic states: If the fire of the year exceeds, it can cause body heat and skin soaking.</p>
<h3>Scabies</h3>
<p>Scabies is a disease of minute bumps. When it appears, it causes incessant scratching, but one may not know how it arises. Scabies says: I do not have roots to grow nor a mother to be formed; I rely on the balance of yin and yang, with dampness and heat shaping me. I usually manifest on the hands of nobles but also cling to the bodies of commoners, capable of making scholars put down their pens and embroiderers stop their needles, indifferent to status, equally affecting all. The doctor inquired: If it doesn’t arise on the body and only attacks the hands, what then? Scabies responded: The palm is governed by the damp earth of Taiyin, while the center of the hand is overseen by the fire of Shaoyang. Earth can generate me, and fire can transform me. Thus, my existence relies on the transformation of damp earth and yang fire, so I must emerge from the palm. The doctor replied: Indeed! However, its form knows movement but not stillness; it can advance but cannot retreat, and it is not transformed by clear qi.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

When this stagnation persists over time, it leads to heat and itching. Thus, in the midst of itching and heat, damp fire can transform into insects, with their form following the moisture and their movement arising from the heat—this is senseless yet sentient. After transformation, these conditions conceal beneath the skin, and they can shift and attack, causing itching and stabbing sensations, perpetuating a cycle of transformation and proliferation that spreads throughout the body. When close to the surface, it can turn into scabies; if prolonged, it can evolve into stubborn wind, often resulting in dry and withered skin that invades the blood vessels, causing relentless itching, which can be relieved by herbal decoctions. Externally, using an ointment made of round balls can help stop itching and eliminate insects; internally, taking a wind-dispelling powder can also disperse wind and cool the blood. It is essential to avoid rich and spicy flavors; avoid hot soups, as these can aggravate the condition.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Persistent dermatitis is caused by a combination of wind, heat, moisture, and insects. It manifests in various sizes and shapes, both dry and wet, and can be new or old. Wind dermatitis resembles clouds; the skin is delicate, and scratching produces white flakes. Moist dermatitis resembles insect activity; scratching yields a fluid. Persistent dermatitis causes no pain at all when scratched. Psoriasis resembles the skin of a cow&#39;s neck, being tough and hard, with scratching feeling like decayed wood. Horse dermatitis is slightly itchy, with white spots connected. Dog dermatitis has clusters of white patches. All these conditions are the result of blood dryness and toxic wind, affecting the spleen and lungs. For initial symptoms, use a wind-dispersing powder with one tael of duckweed, mixed with scallions and soybeans to induce sweating. For long-standing cases, take folk remedies like He Shou Wu pills or wax alum pills. For external treatment, apply a remedy of yellow earth and induce dispersion with Hibiscus skin powder; choose accordingly and results will gradually appear.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescriptions for Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty, Chen Tuduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For treating sores and scabies, use 250 grams of cocklebur, 200 grams of苦参 (kǔ shēn), 30 grams each of fresh licorice, honeysuckle, catnip, and windbreak herb, along with 150 grams of fresh astragalus. Boil them in a large pot of water. While hot, use the steam for fumigation; then wrap the body with two mats and cover with clothes to keep the heat in. Wait until it&#39;s slightly cooled for a bath, and it must continue until there is thirst and cold before stopping. Repeat the bath the next day, re-boiling the residue as before for three days, and the sores and scabies will surely heal.</p>
<p>For scabies, no need for decoctions; instead, use 3 grams each of light powder, perilla leaf powder, and windbreak herb powder, along with 9 grams of walnut meat (with oil) and 9 grams of pig lard, plus 6 grams of white mustards, and grind into balls the size of a marble. Apply to the affected areas, and healing will occur in one day.</p>
<p>For yellow water sores: wherever toxic water flows in, it causes large blisters, known as yellow water sores. They easily rupture with slight movement, indicating that heat poison is trapped in the skin. Wash them with decoctions until healed. The recipe includes 25 grams each of realgar and windbreak herb, boiled in 10 bowls of water; strain and use to wash the sores, ensuring healing.</p>
<p>Treating stubborn ringworm is also easy. Use equal amounts (30 grams) of tree of heaven bark, white mustards, and rhubarb root, along with 9 grams each of light powder and desiccated snail, and 3 grams each of borneol and fresh licorice. Grind these into fine powder, first crush the ringworm skin with lychee shells, then mix this medicinal powder with sesame oil and apply. Healing will occur in three days.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another formula for treating itchy skin conditions:<br>Three segments of soapberry, with the skin removed; half a tael of coptis; two and a half taels of greasy powder. Grind the soapberry and coptis separately into a fine powder. Use two large cups of rice vinegar, combine with the soapberry powder, and boil until thin like soup. Filter to remove residue, then mix in the coptis and greasy powder until uniform. When the condition shows signs of inflammation and seeping, first use the white bark of the hibiscus tree, break the skin, and apply the medicine; relief will be felt within three doses.</p>
<p>Carp fat treats various skin conditions, whether dry or wet, with unbearable itch and pain. One carp, two eggs of a mixed-breed chicken (about the size of a quail egg), half a jin of pig fat, and one and a half taels of realgar, one tael of sulfur. First, boil the pig fat until bubbling, then add the fish and cook until the smoke dissipates. Next, add the eggs to cook down, filter out the residue, mix in the ground realgar and sulfur, and stir until uniform. Store in a container without worrying about time, and use it as needed until healed.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case Study</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;The Confucian Gate on Serving Parents,&quot; it is said that a man named Huo Shengyao approached to buy苦参 (Ku Shen) to treat scabies. He did not understand the properties of the medicine but only heard it could be effective. He brewed a strong decoction and took a bowl, soon after which he vomited a basinful of saliva, and within two or three days, the scabies developed scabs.</p>
<p>A girl, fifteen years old, had wet eczema between her thighs, three to four inches long, extending down to her knees. It was so itchy that she scratched it, yet neither hot nor cold treatments provided relief. When the itching subsided, yellowish-red fluid flowed, and the pain was unbearable. Moxibustion, fumigation, and medications such as sulfur, (艹闾) grass, white silkworms, and sheep&#39;s hoof root did not work. The girl was beautiful, but due to this illness, she could not get married, prompting her parents to seek treatment from a doctor named Dai. He said, &quot;If you can follow my instructions, you will recover.&quot; The parents agreed. Dai used a needle ground to a sharp point and instructed that, during the itching, he would prick over a hundred spots on the eczema, allowing all the blood to flow out. After washing with boiled salt water, he repeated this process four times, and only then was the severe illness resolved. This method is not recorded to inform later generations, fearing it might be misused in the treatment of eczema. The dampness mingling with blood must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>A ten-year-old boy from Caizhai had been suffering from extensive abdominal eczema for over a year; each time he scratched, yellow fluid oozed out. Doctor Dai first made pills from bitter melon stems, and after administration, the symptoms subsided. He then gave him the Zhouche pills and Jun Chuan powder in three to five doses. Lastly, he administered Liang Ge San combined with (石卜) nitrate, and after brewing it to sip at intervals, the boy was cured within a few days.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man experienced discomfort in his lower body, with pain worsening in the afternoon. His legs and ankles were swollen and purple, so blood was extracted from the purple areas. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus Huangqin and Lian for four doses, and he found relief. If the issue were in the upper body, such as purple swelling in the arms or ankles, blood should also be extracted from those areas, and the previous decoction with Chaihu and Huangqin would ensure recovery.</p>
<p>One man developed itchy sores, with severe pain during the afternoon. This condition was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus Huangqin, Lian, Jing, and Fang for several doses until the pain ceased. He was then given Si Wu Decoction with Jizhu, He Shou Wu, and Huangqi for twenty doses until he fully recovered. A scholar named Li Longgang suffered from this ailment all over his body, especially in his legs and feet, with worsening pain in the afternoon, dry mouth, and frequent red urination. This was diagnosed as a deficiency of the kidney channel with heat; he was treated with the Six Flavors Pill for recovery.</p>
<p>A scholar had issues in his arms and feet that itched or swelled in the afternoon, causing fatigue. He took Baidu San on his own, but the pain intensified and his urination became red and thin. This indicated a deficiency of lung and kidney yin; he was treated with a restorative decoction with Shiwuzi and Mai Men Dong for recovery.</p>
<p>Another scholar mistakenly used aggressive treatments, which left him with a weakened vital energy and unable to heal. He was treated with a restorative decoction plus Poria, and his sores healed immediately. However, due to improper care, the condition worsened in the afternoon, necessitating over fifty doses of an Eight Treasure Decoction with Shiwuzi and Mai Men Dong for full recovery.</p>
<p>A man had darkened, itchy skin and expelled black blood, with worsening symptoms in the afternoon. His legs swelled during the day and subsided at night, which I attributed to a deficiency of qi and blood along with heat. He was given a restorative decoction in the morning and a modified Xiaoyao San in the evening, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man, after recovering from an epidemic disease, showed symptoms of his ailment. He used the previous medicine for nourishment and became well. Another patient with the same illness used the method of acupuncture, bled, and died. This was due to a deficiency of Yin and heat in the blood, manifesting as black and itchy skin. How could this result in harming Yin and blood?</p>
<p>A woman who had long been unwell, with little appetite and fatigue, suffered from a deficiency of the liver and spleen, along with false heat. She first used a tonifying formula, the &quot;Renowned Tonifying Qi Decoction,&quot; with added Chuanxiong and pan-fried Gardenia fruit. Her vital energy gradually recovered, and then she took the &quot;Xiaoyao Powder,&quot; leading to gradual healing of her sores. If at night she exhibited a spurious speech, this indicated heat entering the blood aspect, treated with &quot;Xiaochaihu Decoction&quot; and addition of fresh Rehmannia. For those with blood deficiency, a mixture of &quot;Four Substance Decoction&quot; and &quot;Xiaochaihu Decoction&quot; is administered. Once heat subsides, use &quot;Xiaoyao Powder&quot; to nourish the spleen and stomach, producing Yin and blood. There are also cases of alternating chills and fever, which should be treated with the previous medicines.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Treatise&quot; states: A monk from Zhihua Temple suffered from sores and scabs. He used arsenic sulfide and mugwort leaves as medicine, burning them under the bedding for fumigation. The next day, his whole body swelled with blisters; the skin broke and oozed water. He could not eat or drink, and when I offered a remedy, the medicine failed to take effect, leading to death. The poison from the medicine entered his abdomen and dispersed the true Qi; thus, the resulting calamity.</p>
<p>A scholar skilled in sneezing suffered from itchiness. I suspected that damp heat was present within, and the pores were not tightly sealed, allowing external pathogens to afflict him. I recommended the &quot;Renowned Tonifying Qi Decoction&quot; with added Angelica dahurica and Chuanxiong, but he did not follow my advice. Instead, he self-administered &quot;Jingfang Baidu Powder,&quot; which caused night sweats and fever, and prompted thirst and burning pain, with pus and water oozing. He continued with the previous decoction, doubling the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, and Schisandra, and eventually achieved recovery.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>
