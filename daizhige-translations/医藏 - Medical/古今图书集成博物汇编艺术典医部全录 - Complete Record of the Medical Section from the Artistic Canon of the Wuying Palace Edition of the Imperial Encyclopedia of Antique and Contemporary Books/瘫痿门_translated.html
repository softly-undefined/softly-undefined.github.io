<p><strong>Paralysis and Weakness</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Four Seasons and Regulation of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>In the winter month of three, this is the time for closing and storing. The water freezes and the earth cracks; do not disturb the Yang. Go to bed early and rise late, waiting for the sunlight. Make your intentions like those that are hidden and secretive, as if you possess private thoughts or already have achievements. Retreat from the cold and approach the warmth, avoiding any excessive exposure of the skin, so that the vital energy does not hastily diminish. This is the response of winter air and the method of nurturing and storing. Going against this will harm the kidneys, leading to weakness in spring, resulting in fewer offspring.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The kidneys are associated with winter. Opposing the stored energy of winter harms the kidneys, which results in weakness in spring, thus leading to fewer offspring. The liver, representing wood, thrives in winter water and governs the energy and nourishment of spring, vital for the tendons. If the tendons lose their nourishment, weakness arises; if the vital energy descends violently, it leads to weakness.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Vital Energy Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>Due to dampness, the head feels wrapped; if damp heat is not expelled, the major tendons are soft and short, while the minor tendons are slack and long. Softness and shortness cause contraction, while slackness and length lead to paralysis. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The dampness obstructs the vital Yang energy, hence the head feels wrapped. When Yang energy is weak, it fails to nourish the tendons; therefore, major tendons become soft and short, while minor tendons elongate and slacken. The major tendons are connected to the minor tendons within the bones and joints, thus they become soft and short due to stagnant heat; externally, dampness causes them to be slack and long. Shortness results in spasms, while length leads to abandonment.</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Distinctions between Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When the Three Yang energies are affected, symptoms include chills and fever, abscesses and swellings, as well as paralysis and numbness.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Three Yang refers to the Sun Yang. The Sun Yang is the master of all Yang energies and governs the tendons; when the tendons are injured, it results in paralysis, and when the energy is harmed, it leads to numbness. When the Three Yang and Three Yin are ill, it results in partial atrophy and easy paralysis, causing the limbs to be motionless.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Three Yang and Three Yin refers to the Sun and the Greater Yin. If the Sun Yang is deficient, it leads to partial atrophy, and if Yang is deficient and fails to nourish the tendons, it results in paralysis. The spleen pertains to the limbs, thus they become immobile.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What causes atrophy in the five organs?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The lungs govern the skin and hair, the heart governs the blood vessels, the liver governs the tendons and membranes, the spleen governs the muscles, and the kidneys govern the bone marrow. Thus, when the lung heat causes dryness, the skin and hair are weakened and thin, which results in atrophy and paralysis.</p>
<p>[Note: The ability of the body to move and act comes from the nourishment of the internal organs to the tendons, blood vessels, bones, and muscles. When the internal organs are diseased, the exterior of the body is atrophied. Lung heat leads to dryness and thinness of the skin, and since the skin relies on the lungs for nourishment, when the skin is thin, the essence and fluids cannot circulate, resulting in overheating of the five organs and consequently atrophy and paralysis.]</p>
<p>When heart qi is hot, the lower vessels are constricted and the upper vessels are weak. When the upper is weak, there arises atrophy in the vessels, causing joints to be unsteady and the shins to be slack and unable to support the body.</p>
<p>[Note: When heart qi is hot, the qi rises and causes the pulse to become constricted in the upper body. The heart governs the vessels, hence the qi of the pulse turns constricted and rises, leading to weakness in the pulses below. When the meridians are weak, the joints below become unstable; since the joints are unsteady, the tendons and bones loosen, causing the shins to become slack and unable to support the ground.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When liver qi is heated, it causes the gallbladder to leak, resulting in a bitter mouth; the fascia becomes dry, and when the fascia is dry, the tendons become tense and cramp, leading to tendon atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: The gallbladder is attached to the liver, and when liver qi is heated, bile leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth. When bile leaks, the fascia cannot be nourished and dries out, hence the tension and cramps leading to tendon atrophy.)</p>
<p>When spleen qi is heated, it leads to a dry stomach and thirst; the muscles become numb, leading to muscle atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: The qi of the spleen and stomach governs the muscles. When the yangming fluids do not produce, and the taiyin qi does not arrive, the muscles become numb and lead to muscle atrophy.)</p>
<p>When kidney qi is heated, the lower back and spine cannot rise, the bones become frail, and the marrow diminishes, leading to bone atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: Kidney heat depletes fluids; the lower back is the orifice of the kidneys, therefore the lower back and spine cannot extend, leading to diminished marrow and frail bones resulting in bone atrophy.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How does one come to this? Qi Bo said: The lungs are the master of the viscera and cover the heart. When something is lost, and what one seeks cannot be obtained, the lungs become noisy; when they are noisy, the lung heat causes the leaves to wither. Therefore, it is said that the five viscera suffer from lung heat causing withering and paralysis—this is what it means. </p>
<p>(Note: When something is lost, and what one seeks cannot be attained, the heart’s spirit becomes unsettled, and the fire qi rises.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The lungs are the covering of the heart. When metal (the lungs) suffers the fire’s punishment, it leads to wheezing. If the lungs become overheated and dry, there is no way for the fluids to circulate, resulting in heat affecting all five organs. Excessive sorrow can sever the channels, and when they are severed, the yang energy stirs within. This can lead to a collapse beneath the heart, manifesting as blood in the urine. Therefore, this condition is called “the great vessels are empty,” which manifests as muscle atrophy and is transmitted as pulse weakness. Endless thoughts and unfulfilled wishes lead to excessive external desires, causing the tendons to loosen and resulting in muscle atrophy and excessive lust. Thus, it is stated in the lower classic: “Muscle atrophy arises from the liver.” This is related to dampness; if moisture lingers and the environment is damp, the flesh becomes soaked, leading to numbness and resulting in flesh atrophy. Therefore, it is stated in the lower classic: “Flesh atrophy arises from damp conditions.” Long journeys leading to fatigue, encountering great heat and thirst, can internally consume the yang energy. When it is consumed, heat lodges in the kidneys, which are the water organs. If water cannot withstand fire, bones will become withered and marrow will be depleted, leading to an inability of the feet to support the body, resulting in bone atrophy. Therefore, it is stated in the lower classic: “Bone atrophy arises from great heat.” </p>
<p>(Note: “Channels” here refers to the Chongmai, or Penetrating Vessel.)<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The Chong vessel originates from the center of the womb and is considered the sea of the twelve meridians. The heart governs the blood vessels; therefore, if the collateral of the womb is blocked, the heart qi becomes deficient and moves internally. When the heart qi moves, it leads to a downward flow resulting in frequent urination of blood. If there is a deficiency of blood in the exterior vessels, it leads to muscular paralysis, while a deficiency of blood in the internal vessels results in weakness of the pulse. The blood lost in urination can damage the skin and affect the qi and blood in the meridians. Thus, it is said that the great vessels are empty. Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires can harm liver qi. Those who indulge excessively can experience intense desire leading to spontaneous emission. If there is residual dampness and one resides in a low and moist environment, the combination of internal and external dampness can cause the muscles to become soft and numb, leading to muscular atrophy. Long journeys and exhaustion can harm the kidneys; exposure to extreme heat can damage the yin, and thirst can deplete the yin fluids. Therefore, the yang heat can attack the yin, causing heat to accumulate in the kidneys. Now, with excessive yang and depleted yin, water cannot withstand fire, leading to dryness of the bones and deficiency of the marrow, resulting in inability to support oneself, causing bone atrophy. The emperor asked, &quot;How can one differentiate these conditions?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Lung heat presents with pale complexion and damaged hair; heart heat shows a red complexion with engorged vessels; liver heat has a greenish hue with brittle nails; spleen heat exhibits a yellow color with twitching flesh; kidney heat appears black with decayed teeth.&quot;<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>[Note: All atrophy diseases are due to heat in the five organs leading to depletion of essence, unable to nourish the tendons, channels, bones, and flesh; thus, their causes differ and should be diagnosed based on the physical appearance.] The Emperor said: As you say, it is so. Regarding the treatment of atrophy, why alone is the Yangming selected? Qibo replied: Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, governing the nourishment of the tendons and the binding of bones, which facilitate movement. The Chong vessel is the sea of channels, governing the seepage into valleys, and it connects with Yangming at the tendons. The meeting of Yin and Yang is at the tendons, gathering at the Qi thoroughfare, and Yangming presides over it; thus, they all belong to the Dai vessel and intertwine with the Governing vessel. Therefore, when Yangming is deficient, the tendons become loose, the Dai vessel does not pull, resulting in the feet being weak and unable to move. [Note: The five organs and six bowels all receive Qi from Yangming, hence it is called the sea of organs and bowels. The front Yin is where the tendons gather, combining with Taiyin and Yangming, making it the meeting point of all tendons. The blood and Qi generated by Yangming nourish it, hence all atrophies are uniquely treated through Yangming. The Chong vessel arises within the womb, ascending along the back, being the sea of channels.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>What floats externally permeates the valleys, merging with Yangming at the governing vessel. The Shaoyin, Taiyin, and Yangming channels converge at the governing vessel, following the abdomen upwards and meeting at the Qi street, which is governed by Yangming; hence, Yangming is its chief. The three Yin and three Yang, twelve primary channels, along with the extraordinary channels Ren, Du, and Chong, flow up and down, all pertained to the constraints of the Dai channel. The Du channel originates at the perineum, bifurcating into Ren and Chong, ascending along the back and abdomen; thus, Ren, Chong, Shaoyin, and Yangming are all interconnected with the Du channel. Yangming is the sea of food and fluids, governing the nourishment of the governing vessel; if deficient, the governing vessel relaxes, unable to bind the bones, leading to dysfunction in the limbs, resulting in atrophy; if the Dai channel fails to extend, the channels below slacken, causing the feet to weaken and become unusable. This explains why atrophy specifically pertains to Yangming. The Emperor asked: How can one differentiate? Qibo replied: In cases of lung heat, the complexion is pale with hair loss; in cases of heart heat, the complexion is red with engorged vessels; in cases of liver heat, the complexion is bluish with brittle nails; in cases of spleen heat, the complexion is yellow with muscle twitching; in cases of kidney heat, the complexion is dark with decayed teeth. </p>
<p>(Note: The atrophy condition is caused by heat in the five organs leading to the depletion of essences unable to nourish the channels, bones, and flesh; therefore, the signs differ, and should all be diagnosed based on appearance and color.)<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The emperor said: &quot;As you have stated, it is acceptable. Regarding the treatment of atrophy, why do we specifically focus on Yangming?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, responsible for nourishing the primary tendons, which bind the bones and facilitate movement. The Chong vessel is the sea of the meridians, responsible for moistening and irrigating the valleys. It connects with Yangming at the primary tendons. The convergence of Yin and Yang is in the primary tendons, meeting at the Qi street, with Yangming being the primary force there, all belonging to the belt vessel and linked to the governing vessel. Therefore, if Yangming is deficient, the primary tendons become lax, and the belt vessel does not constrict, resulting in the legs becoming atrophied and unable to function.</p>
<p>[Note: The five organs and six bowels all receive Qi from Yangming, hence it is called the sea of the organs and bowels. The front Yin is where the primary tendons gather; Taiyin and Yangming converge there, forming the meeting point of all tendons. The blood and Qi generated by Yangming nourish this gathering, which is why we specifically treat atrophies with Yangming. The Chong vessel arises in the womb and ascends along the back, acting as the sea of meridians. Its superficial aspects irrigate the valleys and converge with Yangming at the primary tendons. Lesser Yin, Taiyin, and Yangming come together in the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels, all converging at the primary tendons, ascending through the abdomen and returning to the Qi street, thus Yangming governs this, making it the dominant force.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The three Yin and three Yang, along with the twelve main channels and the extraordinary vessels Ren, Du, and Chong, follow a path through the upper and lower parts of the body, all constrained by the girdle vessel. The Du vessel begins at the perineum, bifurcating into Ren and Chong as it ascends along the back and abdomen; thus, Ren, Chong, Shaoyin, and Yangming are all interconnected. Yangming is the sea of water and grain, responsible for nourishing the tendons and ligaments. If deficient, the tendons and ligaments loosen, failing to support the bones and facilitating dysfunction, leading to atrophy. If the girdle vessel cannot extend, the tendons in the lower body loosen, causing the feet to weaken and be unusable; thus, these issues of atrophy stem from Yangming.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How should this be treated?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;Nourish their essence and unblock their acupoints, balance their deficiency and excess, harmonize their ascending and descending flow. Tendons, channels, bones, and muscles receive their influences according to the seasons; then the illness will be resolved.&quot; The Emperor said, &quot;Good!&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Nourishing their essence refers to replenishing the true Qi of the five organs. Unblocking refers to facilitating the heat of the five organs. Balancing deficiency and excess means replenishing Qi when deficient and draining when heat is excessive. Harmonizing ascending and descending refers to regulating the flow of Qi. Tendons, channels, bones, and muscles correspond with the five organs, whose Qi responds externally to the four seasons, each receiving the seasonal Qi at the appropriate time to correspond with their depth; then the illness will be resolved.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If the illness is mildly deficient, it leads to lameness; during the first month, the Yang energy thaws the ground energy and emerges. The so-called mild deficiency arises from significant insufficiency during the winter cold, thus it results in lameness.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Interaction and Transformation Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the soil is excessive in the year, rain is abundant and flowing, the kidney water is affected by pathogens, causing ailments such as atrophy and discomfort in the feet. </p>
<p>When the fire is insufficient in the year, cold prevails widely, resulting in diseases like weakness and paralysis, where the feet cannot support the body.</p>
<p><strong>Five Constant Governance Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the Yangming governs the heavens, the tendons suffer atrophy, unable to stand for long.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>The Great Discussion on the Six Primary Yangs</strong></p>
<p>The Sun governs the heavenly order. When people suffer from cold and dampness, their muscles wither, and their legs are weak and unable to move. [Note: This is due to the affliction of cold and dampness.] The Sun governs the heavenly order; when the four elements are present, the muscles wither, and the legs become weak. [Note: The withering of muscles and weakness of legs is due to the dampness of the earth.]</p>
<p><strong>The Essential Discussion of Supreme Truth</strong></p>
<p>When the Taiyin is in the spring, excess leads to weakness in the legs and a heavy lower body. [Note: The heaviness and weakness in the legs result from dampness in the spring, which invades the Taiyin meridian.] All forms of weakness, panting, and vomiting are associated with the upper body. [Note: They ascend from below to above.]</p>
<p><strong>The Spiritual Pivot Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Section on the Manifestations of Diseases in the Organs Due to Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>The spleen pulse being very slack indicates weakness and numbness; mildly slack indicates wind-induced weakness, where the limbs are unusable, and the heart feels clear as if there were no disease. [Note: Weakness and wind-induced weakness both result in the paralysis of the limbs; in severe cases, the disease manifests externally due to internal issues, while in mild cases, the affliction is external without affecting the internal organs, leading the heart to feel clear of disease.] The lung pulse being slightly slack indicates weakness and pathogenic leakage, with sweating below the head that cannot be stopped. [Note: Slackness indicates severe heat causing excessive sweating; lung heat affects the muscles, leading to weakness.] The kidney pulse being slightly slippery indicates bone weakness, where one cannot rise from sitting, and when one stands, vision is impaired. [Note: Bone weakness prevents standing due to heat harming kidney energy; impaired vision results from heat damaging the essence of the bones.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Article on the Spirit</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bone Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>Sour flavors injure the tendons; when the tendons are injured, they weaken, which is termed &quot;leakage.&quot; Salty flavors injure the bones; when the bones are injured, they atrophy, which is termed &quot;withered.&quot; When leakage and withering clash, it is termed &quot;disrupted leakage.&quot; When the nourishing qi does not flow, and the protective qi cannot act alone, both are weak, the three burners cannot regulate, the four modalities are interrupted, the body becomes emaciated, one foot is swollen, yellow sweat appears, and the limbs are cold. If fever occurs, it indicates a rheumatic condition.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>On Febrile Diseases by Zhang Jie</strong></p>
<p>After vomiting and purging from febrile disease, one may experience voiding symptoms of restlessness, with a very weak pulse. If after eight or nine days one has a feeling of fullness and hardness under the heart, pain beneath the ribs, and a sensation of qi rushing upwards to the throat, dizziness, and restlessness in the meridians, this can lead to atrophy over time.</p>
<p><strong>On the Matters of Confucian Filial Piety by Zhang Congzheng</strong></p>
<p>The four conditions of wind, bi syndrome, atrophy, and syncope are described in detail in the Inner Canon. To elaborate further may seem redundant, but it is not. This is for those in modern times who do not read the Inner Canon and misinterpret its essential meanings. The four conditions of wind, bi, atrophy, and syncope are fundamentally different, yet modern practitioners fail to distinguish them, treating them all as cold due to wind and addressing the deficiency with tonics. This misunderstanding leads to prolonged suffering without resolution. The diseases of the extremities manifest differently: the vigorous ones indicate wind, the numb or painful suggest bi syndrome, weakness and lack of use correspond to atrophy, and the cold or heat that inversely occur indicate syncope. Their root causes are also vastly different. Wind is often a combination of wind and heat; bi syndrome involves wind, dampness, and cold; atrophy arises from fire overcoming metal; and syncope can originate from either cold or heat, both arising from below. Current practitioners overlook these origins and mistakenly assign the label of wind upon seeing hands and feet drooping. Yet, as stated in the Zuo Zhuan, wind can lead to myriad diseases of the extremities. Are we not aware that the six atmospheric factors of heat, dryness, dampness, fire, and cold can all cause these four extremity illnesses? I dare to elaborate further in the Zuo Zhuan for those eager to save lives; one may choose wisely from it.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The condition of weakness, known as &quot;wei,&quot; manifests as feeble legs that can hardly walk. This is due to the kidney essence (water) being unable to dominate the heart fire. The heart fire rises to disturb the lung metal, which in turn, is restrained by this fire. The six branches (corresponding to the six organs) then become scorched, leading to a weakness of the skin and hair, resulting in the development of wei. </p>
<p>&quot;Zha&quot; (or “leg weakness”) refers to an inability of the legs to stretch or move properly. The kidney is considered the offspring of the lung&#39;s metal. When the kidney water is diminished, it allows the fire to rise uncontrollably. The kidney governs the marrow, and if the fire is excessive, it depletes the marrow, which leads to an internal excess causing this condition. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Essential Treatise on the True and Great,&quot; both wei and conditions of breathlessness and vomiting pertain to the upper region (upper jiao). The three jiaos represent the hand&#39;s lesser yang and fire. The ailments of wei, breathlessness, and vomiting all exist above the diaphragm and are associated with the lung metal. Thus, muscle weakness leading to pulse weakness is termed &quot;pulse wei,&quot; dampness leading to numbness is termed &quot;flesh wei,&quot; marrow depletion causing leg weakness is termed &quot;bone wei,&quot; and excess in the chamber leads to tendon weakness.</p>
<p>Overall, the causes of wei as a disease are due to excess heat affecting the body, indulgence in desires, excessive force, gradually leading to the condition of wei. Therefore, wei in various forms is associated with the lung, pulse wei with the heart, tendon wei with the liver, flesh wei with the spleen, and bone wei with the kidney. The underlying reason is that the lung is affected by heat, causing its leaves to wither, transmitting this heat to the four organs, resulting in the development of the disease. It is clearly stated that wei conditions do not arise from cold.</p>
<p>Thus, the occurrence of wei is particularly notable in the months of May, June, and July. &quot;Wu&quot; (midday) is designated as the position of the lesser yin fire, &quot;wei&quot; (the earth element) is where dampness, metal, and fire intertwine, and &quot;shen&quot; (the evening) relates to the lesser yang fire. Hence, wei arises during these three months due to heat. Consequently, those suffering from wei will have a pulse that is superficial and large.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Nowadays, those who use medicine often see weakness in the knees and legs, difficulty in walking, or one foot unable to extend, and treat it as cold and damp foot bi-syndrome. They hastily use herbs like black, aconite, milk, myrrh, natural copper, and king&#39;s herb, applying fire from moxa needles, boiling, and steaming with pouches. The weakness worsens, and they die—could this be fate? The treatment for weakness and blockage differs greatly. Wind, cold, and damp blockage can still be treated with steaming, boiling, and moxibustion, and may sometimes yield results. However, using such methods for weakness only aggravates the condition—why is that? Weakness stems from heat in the lungs, leading to a &#39;burnt leaf&#39; condition, which transmits to the five organs; could there be any cold? Treating weakness as a cold condition is akin to killing without a blade. Weakness does not lead to death; deaths arise from erroneous medication. </p>
<p>Once, a soldier named Song Ziyu stationed in Xi City, unexpectedly developed weakness during May and June, unable to use his waist and legs, becoming bedridden. He sought my treatment. Examining his hands, both pulses were slippery and rapid yet strong. I relied on the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; principles that fire indulgence leads to internal heat while causing coldness around the diaphragm due to phlegm. Recent conditions signify heat, while old ones signify cold. Food and drink that linger in the upper abdomen might also be addressed. After the phlegm was resolved, I administered downward treatments, a few dozen times, and he gradually regained clarity in thought and improved appetite. His legs and feet began to lift, his knees straightened, with the heart descending and the kidneys rising. I then followed with a detoxifying decoction of Coptis, adding Angelica and other herbs, along with Heart-Soothing Decoction, Cooling the Diaphragm Powder, and Chaihu Decoction, taking them regularly.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The classics say: To treat diseases of the heart and lungs, the methods are closest; therefore, medications should be used frequently but in small doses. To treat diseases of the kidneys and liver, the methods are furthest; hence, medications may be used less frequently but in larger quantities. Many people find this surprising, yet when I treat atrophy, I commonly apply these methods as if picking up lost items. If I were to deceive others with this, would it not be akin to incurring divine wrath? This is the evidence of Song Ziyu, thus it must be recorded and shown as a testament for future generations. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states that the method for treating atrophy uniquely utilizes the Yangming channel, which is the stomach vessel, the sea of the five organs and six bowels, responsible for nourishing the foundational tendons. The foundational tendons govern the binding of bones, which are located below the navel and above the pubic hair. Additionally, it governs great bodily movements; these movements are the major joints of the body that regulate bending and stretching. Thus, if Yangming is deficient, the foundational tendons become lax; if the foundational tendons are lax, the major vessels do not extend, resulting in weakness and atrophy of the legs.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>When one takes Yangming, it refers to the stomach channel. The stomach is the sea of food and water, the center of human wellbeing in all seasons. With the qi of the stomach as the foundation, if the foundation is strong, then essence can transform; when essence transforms, marrow is nourished; and when marrow is nourished, one can move freely. According to the theory of Yin and Yang correspondence: if one’s form is inadequate, it should be warmed with qi; if essence is lacking, it should be replenished with flavor. Flavor refers to the five tastes; when the five tastes are harmonized, they can replenish essence and enhance qi. The five tastes come from five grains, five vegetables, five fruits, and five kinds of meat. The five tastes value harmony and should not overly favor one. Moreover, it is said: tranquility and emptiness lead to the true qi, and the spirit is internally contained; how can illness arise? If one supplements with metals, stones, grasses, and woods, it will surely increase qi over time. The natural course of transformation results in increased qi over a long duration, leading to premature decline. Thus, people who consume yellow root and苦参 for a long time can turn hot, and those who long consume hot medicines may not end up cold-hearted!<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>On the Effects of Damp Heat Leading to Atrophy of the Lungs and the Reception of Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>Between June and July, dampness prevails, allowing the child to generate abundant heat for the mother. The combination of damp and heat injures the metal (lungs) and severely affects the large intestine, thus cold and cool treatments are required to counteract it. The dry metal succumbs to the damp heat pathogen, severing the source of cold water that supports transformation. When the source is cut off, the kidneys become deficient, leading to severe cases of atrophy and paralysis—resulting in weakness and inability to move from the waist down, and lack of balance in walking, with both feet leaning sideways. Clear and drying decoction should be the remedy.</p>
<p><strong>On Heat Injuries to Gastric Qi</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Needling Intent&quot; states: “When Qi is deficient and the body is hot, it results from heat injury.” The &quot;Atrophy Treatise&quot; mentions: “After long journeys and exertion, encountering excessive heat and thirst, the yang qi suffers internally; when internally attacked, the heat retreats to the kidneys, which are the body&#39;s water organ. Now if water cannot overcome fire, the bones wither and the marrow becomes deficient, leading to limb weakness and resulting in bone atrophy.” Thus, the &quot;Lower Classic&quot; states: “Bone atrophy arises from excessive heat.” This damp heat leads to atrophy, causing weakness and lack of strength in the bones, therefore treatment for atrophy must focus on the Yangming channel. </p>
<p>During the long summer, when damp heat prevails and is intensely strong, many people feel their limbs burdened, spirits low, and sluggishness to movement. Symptoms include fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, heaviness and pain in the joints, sometimes with elevated Qi causing wheezing, body heat and restlessness; distension in the heart region, urine that is yellow and scant, loose stools occurring frequently, possibly with diarrhea of yellowish mucus or resembling rice water, with variations in thirst, disinterest in food, sweating, a heavy body, or diminished sweating—often blood diseases appear prior to Qi deficiency.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>In the pulse, if one feels a strong and slow rhythm, it indicates that dampness is clashing with internal factors, leading to a further delay. Though the symptoms may vary, the heat and dampness from the season remain the same. It is advisable to treat this with a clearing and drying formula, called the Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>If the damp heat affects the kidneys and liver, causing improper movement and weakness in the knees and feet, resulting in a misalignment of the legs, this indicates the presence of atrophy pathology. Add five dashes of wine-fried Huangbo and Zhimu to help restore vitality to the legs.</p>
<p>Atrophy occurs due to damp heat attacking the kidneys and liver, and it must be urgently addressed. Otherwise, the underlying energy in the lower body may be entirely exhausted, leading to paralysis where one cannot move the lower body, accompanied by persistent restlessness and anxiety. </p>
<p>If there is a sensation of heaviness, decreased body weight, normal respiration, and regular urination, and once the damp heat has retreated, or if the added pathogens diminish, there is no need to use the herbs like Wuweizi, Zexie, Zhuling, Fuling, Huangbo, Zhimu, Cangzhu, or Baizhu. Instead, rely on adjusting the medications based on the original symptoms and maintain regular intake of prescribed herbs. It is also essential to incorporate two to three dashes of wine-fried Huangbo.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method [Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p>Treatment of Atrophy Syndrome</p>
<p>The atrophy syndrome must not be treated with wind methods or wind medicines.<br>Atrophy syndrome includes damp-heat, damp-phlegm, qi deficiency, blood deficiency, and stagnant blood. For damp-heat, use Dongyuan Jianbu Pill, to dry dampness and reduce yin fire, along with herbs like Atractylodes, Scutellaria, Huangbo, and Achyranthes. For damp-phlegm, use Erchen Decoction with added Atractylodes, Bai Zhu, Scutellaria, Huangbo, Bamboo Juice, and Ginger Juice. For qi deficiency, use Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Scutellaria, Huangbo, and Atractylodes. For blood deficiency, use Four Substance Decoction with added Huangbo and Atractylodes, decoct, and take with Yin Nourishing Pill. There might also be food stagnation and dead blood obstructing downward movement, generally belonging to heat; use Shen Zhu Siwu Decoction, Huangbo, and similar remedies. </p>
<p>Regarding the five forms of atrophy and related syndromes, a special chapter was dedicated, discussing it in detail; later prescriptions often lack focus on this syndrome. The reason stems from confusion with wind stroke categories. Master Danxi laments the longstanding issues, empathizing with those suffering from this ailment, as many misled by incompetent doctors. Those committed to this field must deeply understand it. Indeed, Chen Wuzhe stated that atrophy results from insufficient internal organs, which is quite valid. However, what is insufficient in atrophy is primarily yin blood, yet all these prescriptions mainly aim to tonify yang and replenish qi—how can one avoid the issues of deficiency and excess? Furthermore, Wuzhe’s principles of the three causes in formulating prescriptions could be considered the best amongst all; however, even he was not clear on this syndrome, let alone others.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Medical Overview</strong><br><strong>Compiled by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;In treating atrophy, one only considers the Yangming channel; this seems to suggest a lack of expansion in understanding. Please clarify for me.&quot; I answered: &quot;All forms of atrophy arise from heat in the lungs. Just this one phrase conveys the essence of the treatment method. The classics state: &#39;The east is real while the west is empty; drain the south and nourish the north.&#39; This indeed refers to the concepts of generation and overcoming, and the grand principles are not beyond this. The east corresponds to wood, which is the liver. The west corresponds to metal, which is the lungs. The south corresponds to fire, which is the heart. The north corresponds to water, which is the kidneys. Among the five directions, only fire has dual aspects. Though the kidneys have two, water resides in one of them. Yang is always in excess, while yin is perpetually insufficient. Hence the texts state, &#39;One water cannot overcome two fires,&#39; which is a necessary principle. The nature of metal is dry and resides above, governing qi, and it fears fire. The nature of earth is warm and resides in the center, governing the limbs, and it fears wood. The nature of fire is to ascend; if desires become excessive, then water loses its ability to nourish, and fire, in its fear, becomes diminished and falls prey to what overcomes it. When the lungs are afflicted by fire, they become heated. Wood, having a rigid and abrupt nature, when the lungs are overheated, loses its ability to nourish; similarly, when the spleen is afflicted by wood, it suffers damage. If the lungs are hot, they cannot regulate the entire body. If the spleen is damaged, the limbs cannot function, resulting in all forms of atrophy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If the south is purged, then the lung&#39;s metal is clear, but the east remains imbalanced; what harm is there to the spleen? If the north is supplemented, then the heart&#39;s fire diminishes and the west is not empty; what heat is there in the lungs? Thus, when the Yangming is full, the tendons are nourished, capable of binding the bones and benefiting the mechanisms of the body. The methods for treating atrophy do not exceed this. Luo Longji also said: when wind and fire are intense, one should nourish the kidney water. Dr. Dongyuan takes ephedra as the sovereign, with astragalus and other tonics assisting, to treat various forms of atrophy without a fixed method. There are cases with phlegm accumulation, excess dampness, excess heat, a mixture of dampness and heat, and those with Qi entrapment; when faced with illness, the prescription is made based on the symptoms. Those skilled in treating atrophy can manage it well! Nonetheless, if the principles are misapplied, treatment may fail. Heaven produces Yang, thickening the Qi and generating heat; ancient sages stated that for those suffering from atrophy, if they do not restrain their tastes, I know they will not find peace. </p>
<p>When heart heat is severe, the fire uniquely blazes upwards. The kidney&#39;s pulse usually descends, but when fire is intense and ascends, the kidney pulse also rises in accordance with the blazing fire. The Yin Qi rebels; fire inside burns higher; the Yin rises separating from the Yang, failing to maintain its position below. The heart&#39;s Qi flows through the vessels, thus yielding atrophy, the knees and wrists resembling those that have been broken, unable to assist one another; the meridians and tendons slacken and do not support the body. One may descend for hundreds of lines and still recover.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Differentiation of the Treatments for Atrophy Disease and Wind Disease</p>
<p>Based on discussions in Danxi&#39;s writings, atrophy disease and wind disease are treated differently. This is because of the treatment for stroke mentioned in the &quot;Jufang,&quot; where Menglang uses diaphoretic and damp-expelling medicines that harm blood and qi, attacking the root cause, without understanding methods for nourishment. Thus, he references atrophy disease to remedy the shortcomings of the &quot;Jufang,&quot; and his words reflect this perspective. However, the symptoms outlined in the &quot;Jufang&quot; for stroke—such as uncoordinated limbs, needing assistance to stand, mental confusion, and incoherent speech—are indeed similar to those of heat disease as described in the &quot;Neijing.&quot; It is essential to note the differences. The &quot;Zhenjing&quot; states that when genuine qi departs and the pathogenic factor remains, it leads to partial atrophy. The discourse on atrophy indicates that when the Yangming is deficient, the muscles relax, the belt vessel fails to draw, leading to atrophy and inability to use the feet. Thus, it is understood that the uncoordinated limbs in the case of atrophy occur due to obstructing evil qi in the channels, whereas in the case of atrophy disease, it is due to a deficiency in Yangming, muscle relaxation, and failing belt vessel. There are symptoms of erratic will in atrophy disease, but none in true atrophy disease itself. The disease of atrophy is also known as wind atrophy, combining internal injury and external invasion, while atrophy disease is solely induced by internal injury. Wind atrophy occurs due to violent impacts, while atrophy disease develops gradually due to laziness. All of this clarifies that atrophy and atrophy disease are distinct ailments.</p>
<p>From &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot; by Wang Lun, Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Atrophy syndrome should not be treated as wind disease.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Paralysis and weakness are diseases caused by the absence of blood and the combination of phlegm, fire, and damp heat. The ancients said that one should not treat these with wind-dispelling methods, yet they often used wind herbs like Xiao Xu Ming Decoction, West Zhou Xu Ming Decoction, and dispelling wind decoction, which contain ingredients such as Qiang Huo, Fang Feng, Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Wu Tou, and Xi Xin. These herbs disperse wind evils and open the pores. However, improper use may further dry up the yin and blood. </p>
<p>Note: According to previous observations, many cases in Jiangnan are attributed to yin deficiency and qi deficiency, with damp heat affecting the fire. Paralysis and weakness often pertain to the yin deficiency and damp heat in the Yangming channels of the hands and feet, so the diagnosis must be made with care.</p>
<p>Medical Classics Must Read 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi】</p>
<p>General Discussion</p>
<p>It is noted that weakness is a serious illness, hence the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; repeatedly discusses it. Earlier scholars varied in their compilations on this topic, sometimes associating it with deficiency and labor, or with wind and dampness, which strays from the core principles. Only Dan Xi particularly emphasized its significance, though his explanations were somewhat lacking. The classic discusses how the root of diseases involves all five organs but especially emphasizes the Taiyin Lung channel. It also states that while treatment methods involve various channels, special emphasis is placed on the Yangming Stomach channel. </p>
<p>Why this emphasis? The lung, being of the metal element, is dry in nature and is located above, governing the transformation of qi to circulate throughout the body, being sensitive to fire. When the heat and fire of the five organs vaporize, the metal element is weakened, leading to lung heat and damage. Thus, the diseases vary among the five organs but the place of the hand Taiyin is commonly affected. The spleen, being of the earth element, is damp and located centrally, receiving grains and water to nourish the limbs, also being sensitive to the wood element.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>When the lung meridian is invaded and loses its proper state, the wood is not restrained and insults what it conquers. Therefore, the treatment principles are categorized by the five organs, and no part of the foot yangming is overlooked. Since it is said that the lung is harmed, treatment should focus on the lung. But why does Qibo exclusively select yangming? According to the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; the true qi received from heaven combines with the grain qi to fill the body. If yangming is deficient, the five organs cannot receive their nourishment and cannot circulate blood and qi, nourish the sinews and bones, or benefit the joints. Therefore, when the body is unable to receive food and water, it results in atrophy; it is not merely about selecting yangming. This is why Dancai says: draining the south clears the lung metal, and the east becomes deficient, so how can the stomach be harmed? Enriching the north causes the heart fire to descend and the west to remain unexhausted, so how can there be heat in the lungs? This statement is indeed correct. If the stomach is deficient and appetite decreases, it should be treated with aromatic and warm medications. If one is overly concerned with the idea of draining the south, the stomach will worsen. If one can apply treatment based on this principle, half the battle against atrophy will have been won. As for the seven emotions and six excesses, which have many variations, formulating prescriptions based on specific illnesses cannot be fully expressed through words.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>For excess heart fire, use Liangge San. For liver fire disturbance, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang. For water deficiency and fire inflammation, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan.

<p><strong>General Principles in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Keng Tang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weakness</strong>: Refers to limbs that are soft and powerless, with joints relaxed and not contracting. The sage deems weakness to be crucial among various ailments, thus dedicating a section to it. It divides the heat of the five organs into named diseases, their corresponding skin, vessels, tendons, muscles, and bones leading to the feet being unable to support weight. It narrates the evils of heat affecting the five organs, indicating that each organ is harmed by a specific evil. The subtle meaning here is that through the five emotions, five labors, and six excesses, one may affirm the desires of the organ qi, each providing an example. If one comprehends the eighty-one sections, one can see that the five labors, five emotions, and six excesses indeed produce the heat of the five organs resulting in weakness.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>What is it that causes this? It is said that when lung qi is hot, the skin becomes withered, resulting from loss and unfulfilled desires; similar to another text which states that one who is initially rich may later become poor. Although it may not harm the external influences, the skin burns and tendons contract, leading to weakness and paralysis. This is linked to the seven emotions being suppressed. If we discuss conditions like atrophy, shortness of breath, nausea, or feelings of anger and depression, all belong to the aforementioned. Therefore, how can we say that any heat does not cause atrophy, or that any pulse is unaffected by heat? For instance, if heart qi is hot, it leads to pulse atrophy, as this arises from excessive sorrow, where yang energy moves inward, causing blood to collapse and the pulse to become vacuous, leading to pulse atrophy. This regards the heart as the governing organ of spirit, essential to the pulse. Furthermore, each of the five organs has its spirit and aspirations. When anger arises, it causes qi to ascend abnormally, and in severe cases, it may lead to vomiting blood—manifestations of the five emotions. Heat injuring blood causes blood to reverse in the meridians, leading to emptiness, as if joy in form meets sorrow in aspiration. When ailments arise in the pulse, all five emotions contribute to its atrophy, not solely sorrow. Additionally, the five emotions affecting each organ causes damage to their associated spirits. Severe anger can force tendons to stretch, while joy manifests in bodily illness, resulting in joy in spirit and suffering in form, whereas joy in form and sorrow in aspiration leads to illness in the tendons.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>If one is troubled by anxiety, fear, joy, or anger, then due to the vast void, the five organs affect each other, leading to illnesses manifesting in twenty-five variations. This results in conditions such as the decay of the large bones and the sinking of the flesh. The spirit and will within the five organs can be considered as heat illnesses, which cannot be enumerated. For instance, if the liver&#39;s energy is heated due to endless thoughts, and desires remain unfulfilled, it is akin to the lungs&#39; unfulfilled longing. Excessive indulgence in sexual relations causes relaxation of the fundamental tendons, similar to the exhaustion resulting from long travels of the kidneys. From this, it is evident that the five kinds of labor can each cause harm to the corresponding skin, flesh, tendons, and bones of the five organs. For example, if the spleen&#39;s energy is heated, it is influenced gradually by dampness, which is related to matters involving water. If, in a given year, the Yin earth is damp, with the heavens controlling moisture from springs, this leads to muscle atrophy and the feet becoming weak and unable to recover. This serves as an example of how external factors arise from the five organs. The same applies to all other organs.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The return of lesser yin leads to muscle atrophy; the return of lesser yang leads to pulse atrophy; the governance of yangming over heaven’s affairs results in bone atrophy influenced by the four energies. The governance of jueyin confirms that wind energy descends, and spleen energy ascends, resulting in atrophy of the muscles. There are conditions due to dampness, initially felt as wrapping; if damp heat persists and is not dispelled, the large muscles become soft and short, while the small muscles are loose and elongated, where softness and shortness denote rigidity, and looseness and elongation denote atrophy. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; discusses the eight transformations of wind, which can injure muscles, flesh, or bones, with excess heat causing the muscles to loosen, bones to wither, and flesh to decay. Thus, it is common for external excess to give rise to diseases of the five viscera. </p>
<p>However, some do not mention the external pathogens, but instead discuss the conditions arising from internal deficiencies of organs. For example, a spleen ailment denotes a heavy body and muscle atrophy, with foot atrophy resulting in difficulty walking; kidney deficiency can lead to lameness or paralysis; a surplus of the three yangs with insufficient three yins leads to unevenness; if the small yang of the foot is deficient, it results in atrophy of the legs, preventing one from rising from a seated position; if the small yang of the foot is deficient, one may experience failure to retract the feet and thin shins. Furthermore, injuries from diet occur; an overly salty flavor can fatigue the bone energy, and an overly spicy flavor can weaken the tendons and meridians, particularly among those indulging in rich foods, leading to uneven atrophy and fatigue.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>What has been presented above pertains solely to the condition of weakness due to insufficient use of the original principles. As for the case when all five organs are intensely heated, causing the spirit to become dim and collapse, and both hands and feet to lose function—what is commonly referred to as paralysis—surely this too is a severe form of weakness. Furthermore, in the subsequent discussion of lung weakness as an organ disease, there are also cases where heart qi weakness results in death, indicating that all five organs can indeed be afflicted by weakness; this can be understood. The &quot;Original Disease Theory&quot; discusses the involuntary loss of urine, stating that lung heat afflicts the kidney area, impeding the circulation in the foot&#39;s Shao Yin channel, so that qi and blood cannot flow freely, leading to weakness and paralysis. This causes the spirit to be ineffective and unable to perform its functions, resulting in the involuntary loss of urine and feces. Therefore, from this discussion, it is evident that whenever the spirit, qi, or blood is either weak or obstructed, any of the organs, channels, or related areas—internally or externally—may become dysfunctional. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; emphasizes this matter, repeatedly addressing it in various chapters, yet later readers have completely missed its essence.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The gathering of discussions on theories often sees either the concept of &quot;excessive labor&quot; or the &quot;Wind Gate.&quot; It was Danxi who first elucidated errors that had persisted for over a thousand years, and yet his explanations remain unclear; this is regrettable. It is stated: &quot;The discussion of atrophy involves the Yangming channel, aligning with the ancestral sinews at the Qi Street. Due to Yangming deficiency, the ancestral sinews become lax, and the belt channel fails to pull, resulting in foot atrophy, hence the sole focus on Yangming.&quot; Now, how shall you treat the various conditions of illness and atrophy that you have examined? It is said: &quot;The sage speaks of one principle, which can be extrapolated to ten or a hundred; is it solely about foot atrophy? The principle of complementing each channel and assisting its roots, understanding their deficiencies and strengths, harmonizing the counterflow and proper flow, contains all treatment methods for dispelling pathogens.&quot; The mention of regulating the channels, muscles, and flesh, according to their seasonal afflictions, also pertains to the treatment methods for the various conditions of atrophy. Nonetheless, it is noted that no case of atrophy arises without the deficiency of Yangming.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>How can this be explained? According to the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it is said that the true qi is received from Heaven and combines with the food qi to fill the body. It is also stated that food first enters the stomach&#39;s two regions to nourish the five organs and separately branches out into the two pathways of nourishment and defense. The great qi that stagnates and does not flow accumulates in the chest, known as the sea of qi. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the foot Taiyin is the three Yin; its channels traverse the stomach and belong to the spleen, thus Taiyin circulates qi within the three Yin. The Yangming represents the exterior and serves as the sea of the five organs and six bowels, circulating qi in the three Yang. Each organ receives qi from Yangming via its respective channels, hence the stomach facilitates the movement of its fluids. When the limbs are unable to absorb the qi of food and water, they gradually weaken day by day, leading to blockages in the Yin pathways; the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the qi to thrive, thus they do not function properly. The Chong vessel originates below the kidneys and connects with the Ren vessel that arises from the womb, governing the blood sea; it is also referred to as the sea of the five organs and six bowels, all of which derive nourishment from it.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The upper channels absorb the three Yang and nourish all essence, while the lower channels absorb the three Yin and nourish all sinews, warming the muscles. They connect with the Yongming channel at the Qi Chong point. Hence, when Yongming is deficient, the channel is loose, and the Dai Mai is unresponsive, resulting in foot weakness and inability to move. Observing this, we see that true Qi is the way of heaven, while grain Qi is the way of earth. Without heaven, earth cannot generate; without earth, heaven cannot be realized. Therefore, true Qi and grain Qi must come together to create life, establishing the pathway for physical Qi. Thus, when Yongming is deficient and the five organs receive nothing, they cannot circulate the blood and Qi, nourish Yin and Yang, moisten the sinews and bones, or facilitate joints. If the Qi Sea receives nothing, then the Wei Qi cannot warm and nourish the flesh, fill the skin, or support the opening and closing of the pores. If the Blood Sea receives nothing, then the channels outside and inside are empty; consequently, the spirit, Qi, and blood that sustain life become weak. Therefore, in the entire body, wherever it cannot receive the water and grain Qi, it becomes nonfunctional and results in atrophy. To treat atrophy is not merely to address Yongming; what else could be done?<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of atrophy, as detailed in the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; indicates that the symptoms associated with the five organs are all related to heat. These symptoms arise from the heat of the lungs, leading to dryness in the metal element and depletion of the water element, thus resulting in atrophy. The treatment theories of Danxi indeed align with this. However, upon closer examination of the texts, it is stated that excessive sorrow can obstruct the collaterals, leading to pulse atrophy. Endless thoughts and unmet desires can cause muscle atrophy, while dampness can cause water-related issues, leading to atrophy of flesh; therefore, they are not entirely due to heat. This suggests a complexity—there are those who generate heat from such conditions, but there are also those whose vital energy is harmed. When vital energy is damaged, it can result in insufficient essence to nourish, and insufficient blood to sustain; this is quite common as well.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If one were to generally discuss fire, there would be a concern that genuine yang might be depleted, and that soil might weaken and water dry up, which some could not endure. Therefore, one should consider the shallow and deep aspects of cold and heat, carefully examine the voids and fullness, as well as the urgency of conditions in order to administer treatment, so that a complete cure for atrophy might be achieved.</p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;If dampness and heat are not eliminated, the large tendons become soft and short, while the small tendons become slack and long; softness and shortness lead to rigidity, while slackness and length lead to atrophy.&quot; This pronouncement from the Inner Canon on tendon diseases is merely an illustrative remark meant to inspire self-reflection. It does not imply that the large tendons must be without slackness or that the small tendons must be free from softness and shortness. For instance, atrophy and weakness surely derive from slackness and length; could the large tendons truly be unaffected? The meaning conveyed in this classic can be understood from this perspective. Thus, beyond the condition of atrophy, whenever encountering diseases like spasm, one must recognize that rigidity arises from softness and shortness, while paralysis and weakness result from slackness and length. This captures the essence of the Inner Canon, and one can also obtain the rationale for distinguishing between cold, heat, dryness, and dampness.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Generally, weakness caused by damp heat presents with a rapid and slippery pulse and many signs of restlessness and heat, so one must first eliminate the heat. The Er Miao San (Two Wonderful Powder) is appropriate, adjusting according to the symptoms. If there is both yin deficiency and heat, one should use a modified version of the Si Wu Tang (Four Substance Decoction), Hu Jing Gu Wan (Tiger Bone Pill), or similar formulas like Dan Xi Bu Yin Wan (Dan Xi&#39;s Yin Supplement Pill) and Zi Yin Ba Wei Wan (Eight Flavor Nourishing Pills). If there is absolutely no heat present and the condition arises solely from kidney water deficiency and liver blood deficiency, one should avoid using cooling medicines that could weaken the vital energy. The best option is Lu Jiao Jiao Wan (Deer Horn Gel Pill) or formulas like Jia Wei Si Jin Wan (Modified Four Jin Pills), Ba Wei Di Huang Wan (Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill), and Jin Gang Wan (Diamond Pill), which can all be selected as needed. If there is yin deficiency without dampness or with excessive sweating, using Cang Zhu (Atractylodes) lightly is discouraged, as weakness is especially intolerant of exterior dispersing treatments and could further harm the yin. Dong Yuan considers Huang Bo (Phellodendron) as the primary medicine, supplemented by Huang Qi (Astragalus) and other tonics to treat various weakness conditions, without a fixed method. There can be cases with phlegm accumulation, excessive dampness and heat, a mix of damp and heat, or accompanying qi issues, in which case one should create a treatment plan according to the specific illness; this is also an excellent method for treating weakness.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The &quot;Zuan Yao&quot; states: For damp-heat, the Jianbu pill should be supplemented with remedies that dry dampness and reduce fire, such as Huangbo, Huangkui, and Cangzhu. For damp-phlegm, add Cangzhu, Baizhu, Huangkui, and Huangbo to the Erchen Decoction, along with bamboo juice and ginger juice. For blood deficiency, add Cangzhu and Huangbo to the Four Herbal Compounds, and take the Xiangbui pill. For qi deficiency, add Cangzhu, Huangkui, and Huangbo to the Four Noble Herbs. Huangbo and Cangzhu are essential medicines for treating atrophy. Although the above prescriptions target different conditions, they all aim to reduce fire and clear dampness, which is the fundamental principle of treatment that remains consistent.</p>
<p>Chen Wuze remarked: The human body is formed of skin, blood vessels, sinews, muscles, and bone marrow, with internal organs such as the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys presiding over them. Yet, if one indulges in emotions, fatigue, or idleness, it can lead to the depletion of internal essence and blood, resulting in weak and feeble blood vessels and muscles, thus causing atrophy that resembles symptoms of soft wind syndrome. Soft wind syndrome occurs due to external factors like wind and cold, where the righteous qi clashes with the evil qi, causing swelling and pain, indicating a real pathogen. The atrophy arises from insufficient internal organs; however, if one does not overexert themselves, there will be no pain, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Weakness</strong></p>
<p>When a person suffers from complete depletion of vital energy and blood, resulting in multiple ailments throughout the body, they may experience continuous headaches accompanied by bone pain or abdominal pain along with pain in all four limbs. These symptoms, often indicative of weakness, should primarily be treated by addressing the Yangming stomach fire. However, if the stomach fire is overly vigorous and the body, including the limbs, becomes emaciated, one cannot solely target the stomach meridian. </p>
<p>The formula consists of three qian each of ginseng, astragalus, white peony root, poria, white mustard seed, and angelica, five qian each of job&#39;s tears and plantago seeds, one qian of chrysanthemum flowers, one liang each of ophiopogon and cooked rehmannia, and five fen each of dried tangerine peel and fermented wheat. Boil these in three large bowls of water until it reduces to one bowl, and take this as a dose. </p>
<p>While one might ordinarily use bamboo leaf and gypsum decoction when Yangming fire is excessive, the choice to utilize ginseng, poria, astragalus, and cooked herbs as the primary ingredients is made to replenish vital energy and blood. The stomach fire is so strong that it has already scorched the vital energy and blood; further use of the Baihu decoction would temporarily relieve the fire toxicity, but it would inevitably lead to a severe depletion of bodily fluids. Thus, it is preferable to use a large dose of tonifying herbs for energy and blood, as adequate hydration will naturally quell the fire.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>In the middle of the formula, one should appropriately use ingredients such as Yuan Shen, Mai Dong, and Gan Ju, which are purely meant to quell the spreading fire of the Yang Ming. Moreover, with the addition of Dang Gui and similar herbs to nourish blood and support the source, this is quite effective. However, if the dosage of these herbs is small, it not only fails to benefit but may actually exacerbate the fire’s intensity; this is the brilliance of this major treatment method. Generally, the major treatment method should be applied at the onset of deficiency conditions with excess stomach fire; using large doses can turn defeat into victory. If one hesitates and is cautious initially, fearing to use large doses, and waits until the stomach qi has weakened before realizing the need for large doses, it will be too late.</p>
<p>For cases of weakness where the individual cannot get out of bed year-round, has a glowing complexion, weak and powerless feet, and cannot take a step, this indicates an excess of Yang Ming fire. It is unnecessary to treat the legs directly; instead, calming the stomach fire will naturally strengthen the legs. If one does not calm the stomach fire and only uses nourishing yin herbs, an increase in food intake will further weaken the legs. The method should include three taels of Yuan Shen, one tael each of Mai Dong and Shu Di, three qian of Gan Ju Hua, and one qian each of Ren Shen and Tu Si Zi, boiled with several bowls of water to yield four bowls of decoction. Allowing for unrestricted consumption will gradually calm the stomach fire, and the legs will naturally regain strength. Thus, this approach treats the legs indirectly. </p>
<p>It is essential to discern that not all weakness is due to Yang Ming deficiency; this distinction must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>This condition cannot result in the patient getting out of bed, yet they can eat well. The patient feels weak and cannot stand. People think this is due to deficiency, but it is not. This is due to extreme cold in the kidneys leading to a boiling fire; it appears as deficiency yet is not. At the onset, it was indeed due to the blazing fire of the yangming, and if cooled down, the stomach fire would diminish, while the kidney water would dry up, leading to nighttime coughing and phlegm. During the day, the patient feels somewhat better, groaning on the bed, eating little and slowly, and feeling increasingly uncomfortable. </p>
<p>The prescription should be one tael of Yuan Shen, three taels of Mai Dong, and two taels of cooked dihuang, prepared with water. If there is liver fire, add five qian of Bai Shao and prepare with water. Four doses may allow the patient to get out of bed. Subsequently, a large dose of Six Flavor Decoction should be prepared, adding one tael each of Mai Dong and cooked dihuang, one qian of Wu Wei, four qian of Shan Zhu Yu, three qian each of Shan Yao and Dan Pi, and two qian each of Ze Xie and Fu Ling, brewed with water. </p>
<p>The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of Yuan Shen and Mai Dong to nourish the lung metal and eliminate the wandering fire in the heart; it also excels in using cooked dihuang to replenish kidney water, which ensures there is enough water and strengthens the stomach fire. When the lung metal naturally nourishes kidney water, the kidney water will be stored in the kidney palace and will not surge upward, thus resolving the cough without needing to suppress it.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The weakness of the legs, unable to walk, is thought to be due to a deficiency of kidney essence, but that is not the case. The issue is that the qi is insufficient to function properly. The prescription is to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding three liang each of ginseng and ox knee, five liang of golden needle stone, and one liang of astragalus. After two doses, strength will return to the legs; after four doses, one should be able to walk. Ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes are all supreme tonics for qi, while ox knee and golden needle stone are divine remedies for strengthening the legs, making this combination effective.</p>
<p>As for those with atrophy, they must lie in bed for a long time and cannot suddenly rise; what is the reason? All the symptoms of atrophy belong to the yangming stomach fire. When this fire exhausts the kidney essence, the bones become empty and without nourishment, making standing impossible. However, if only treating the yangming, when will the marrow in the bones be replenished? It is difficult to regain strength in both legs. The method is to use one liang each of yuanshen and ophiopogon, two liang of rehmannia, and two qian of ox knee, decocting and taking it. The brilliance of this formula lies in not treating the yangming, but directly addressing the kidney channel to replenish its deficiency. When kidney essence is restored, the stomach fire will naturally subside. Moreover, the ophiopogon clears lung qi, and the ox knee strengthens the knees and shins; thus, using this prescription long-term can prevent the symptoms of atrophy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>If one only uses gypsum and rhizome of anemarrhena to bring down the fire in the stomach, the fire will be lowered, and the kidney&#39;s water will further dry up. Then, what will replenish the bone marrow? It&#39;s no wonder that after years of treatment, one becomes increasingly fatigued. The symptoms of weakness and atrophy are due to the excess fire of the Yangming. If the kidney&#39;s water is insufficient to nourish, then the bones become hollow and cannot support the body. </p>
<p>The prescription should include three taels of rehmannia, three taels of shan zhu yu, two taels of mai dong, boiled in water and taken. The essence of this formula lies in the fact that rehmannia and shan zhu yu together enrich the water, while rehmannia removes the floating fire, and mai dong nourishes the lung&#39;s Yin, allowing Yin to flourish and Yang to diminish, naturally extinguishing the fire’s flame. Once the flame is extinguished, the metal and water will regenerate, there will be fluids in the organs, and the bone marrow will be replenished. Can the legs still be incapable of walking?</p>
<p>Regarding the prescription for weakness, use three taels of coix, three taels of rehmannia, one tael of mai dong, one qian of north wuwu herb, and five qian of niu xi, boiled in water and taken. The brilliance of this formula is that, with three taels of coix, rehmannia will not be overly damp, mai dong will not be excessively cold, and niu xi will not be too aggressive, allowing one to gain benefits from all three ingredients, enabling long-term use and achieving results.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>When atrophy (weizheng) persists without improvement, it is because the fire of the Yangming has completely consumed the water of the kidneys. However, how can one avoid death and continue to exist? Although the kidney water is dried up, the metal of the lungs still obtains the vital energy from the stomach to nourish it. When the lung metal has energy, it must flow down to generate kidney water. Despite the kidneys being shriveled, there will always be some moisture at night, and the kidney channel continually has vitality; hence, one survives and does not die.</p>
<p>The prescription is to use half a pound of ophiopogon, one pound of cooked rehmannia, seven taels of rhemannia root, and one tael of schisandra, boiled in twenty bowls of water until six bowls remain. Take three bowls in the morning, two in the afternoon, and one at midnight for two consecutive days; one will surely be able to sit up. </p>
<p>Then, change the prescription to eight taels of cooked rehmannia, three taels of rhemannia root, four taels of ophiopogon, three qian of north schisandra, four qian of cornelian cherry, and one tael of cattle’s knee; boil in ten bowls of water until two bowls remain, taking one bowl in the morning and one in the evening. After ten days, one will be able to walk, and after a month, one will return to normal.</p>
<p>By greatly nourishing the water of the lungs and kidneys, the fire of the Yangming will cease to consume itself. The reason for atrophy lasting without death is that it stems from the moisture provided by the lungs, supported by the roots of the kidneys. If the kidney water had no roots, where would the night moisture needed for the lung metal arise from? I would simply see it as a withering. It is precisely because there are roots that one does not die.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Therefore, using large doses of kidney tonics, one can recover from illness, as they have a foundation that can be salvaged. The treatment for atrophy also varies. The formula consists of one tael each of Yuanshen (Radix Ginseng) and Shanzhuyu (Cornus Fruit), three taels each of Shudi (Rehmanniae Radix) and Shashen (Adenophora Root), four taels of Maidong (Ophiopogon), five qian of Wuweizi (Schisandra Fruit), decoct in water for ingestion. In ten days, one can be up and about; I have personally tested this, and it is remarkably effective. </p>
<p>For those with atrophy who cannot get out of bed and have become useless, the internal fire is intensely burning, having dried up the kidney water. If one does not replenish the kidneys and only aims to reduce the fire, there will be no hope of rejuvenation. Although treating atrophy often focuses on the Yangming (the stomach&#39;s fire), the stomach fire must certainly be reduced, while the kidney water must also be replenished. </p>
<p>I now share an extraordinary formula that replenishes water amidst fire, reduces fire within water, harmonizes the stomach and kidneys, thus treating both conditions simultaneously. Naturally, bone marrow will increase, and burning heat will disperse; the atrophy will self-cure without direct treatment. This formula is named &quot;Jiang Bu Dan&quot; (Reinforcing and Reducing Pill): It consists of three qian of Ren Shen (Ginseng), one tael each of Shudi, Yuanshen, and Maidong, five qian each of Ganju Hua (Chrysanthemum), Shengdi (Raw Rehmannia), Shashen, and Digupi (Lycium Bark), and two qian of Cheqianzi (Plantago Seed); decoct in water for ingestion. This formula includes both replenishing and reducing ingredients, making it truly wondrous.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>When the fire of the stomach does not arise, it will not consume the yin in the kidneys; when the water of the kidneys is sufficient, it can control the heat in the stomach. The two interact and support each other, creating a remedy for atrophy—who can surpass this? When a person has weak legs and cannot stand, yet their appetite remains strong, if they resist hunger even slightly, their head and face will feel hot, and they may have persistent coughing—this is also a sign of atrophy, as the heat of the stomach fire rushes upwards to the lung metal. The lung metal is pressured by fire, unable to transmit the clear and purifying energy to the lower abdomen, causing kidney water to dry up, the marrow in the bones to diminish, thus they cannot stand. Meanwhile, the fire of the stomach burns on, allowing them to eat well yet still hunger; over time, the water will dry up and the marrow will be depleted, leading to death—must we not urgently drain the fire from the stomach? However, if we drain the fire without supplementing the water, the stomach fire will have nothing to restrain it, making it hard to cease. The formula for awakening atrophy is as follows: [ingredients] cooked rehmannia, yam, and original root, each one tael; ginseng, Angelica sinensis, and white peony root, each five qian; white mustard seed three qian, fermented wheat two qian; decoct and consume. After one dose, the fire decreases; after two doses, the fire retreats; after ten doses, there will be signs of recovery from atrophy, and thirty doses may achieve complete healing. This formula is remarkable as the sweet chrysanthemum flower serves as the monarch, draining the fire of the yangming without harming the qi of the stomach; the rest merely supplements kidney water to generate liver blood, strengthens the spleen qi, and alleviates phlegm. In essence, treating atrophy focuses on the yangming; draining yangming first, then assisting with other herbs, makes success easier.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Guide to the Collection of Medical Practices</strong></p>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states: In spring, target the collaterals and major tendons between the flesh; in severe cases, go deep, in moderate cases, go shallow. In summer, target the skin, muscle, and collaterals on the surface. In autumn, target the joints, following the methods of spring. In winter, target the wells and collaterals, thus going deep and holding. This is the order of the four seasons, where qi resides, illnesses converge, and organs are suitably treated. For cramping, treat while standing; it can help restore function. For weakness, target while stretching; it can help with recovery. The Taiyang channel originates at Zhi Yin and connects at the Ming Men. The Ming Men is the eye. The Yangming channel originates at Li Dui and connects at the forehead. The forehead refers to the area near the ears. The Shaoyang channel originates at Qiao Yin and connects at the ear drum. Taiyang is for opening, Yangming is for closing, and Shaoyang is the pivot. Therefore, when open or twisted, it leads to muscle spasms and sudden illnesses. For acute diseases, target Taiyang, checking for excess or deficiency. An obstruction is when the skin feels burnt and weak. When closed or twisted, qi cannot settle, leading to atrophy. For atrophy, target Yangming, checking for excess or deficiency. When there is no settling, true qi is stagnant, and evil qi resides. If the pivot twists, the bones dislocate and cannot stabilize; thus, target Shaoyang, checking for excess or deficiency. Bone dislocation refers to loose joints that do not contract.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>The so-called &quot;bone channel&quot; refers to the origin of movement; it is important to investigate its root. The lesser yang of the foot is named &quot;brightness,&quot; located five inches above the ankle, separated from the &quot;jueyin,&quot; connecting to the metatarsal. In reality, it is related to &quot;jue&quot; (numbness), while if it is empty, it leads to weakness and paralysis, making it impossible to rise from a seated position; this is its distinct feature.</p>
<p>Weakness and numbness are like a constriction of the extremities, and the disease can be resolved with treatment twice a day. For those lacking sensation, it can be known in ten days; without interruption, the illness will cease. In febrile diseases, with a pale face and head pain, and restlessness in the limbs, treatment should be taken between the tendons, using the fourth needle in the four extremes. </p>
<p>For limb paralysis, when the eyes are congested, the connection should be sought at the liver, but gold cannot be extracted there; gold represents the lung. These twelve evils are all the strange evils that invade the empty orifices. Thus, where the evil resides, there is deficiency. If the upper qi is insufficient, the brain feels unfulfilled, the ears suffer from ringing, the head feels heavy, and the eyes become dizzy. If the middle qi is deficient, urination and defecation become disrupted, and the intestines suffer from noises. If the lower qi is lacking, it leads to weakness and heart distress; it is necessary to replenish the area below the outer ankle.</p>
<p>For weakness and heart distress, the needle should be inserted two inches above the big toe; another method is to replenish the area below the outer ankle. The &quot;Classic of Changes&quot; states: if the foot is weak and unresponsive, one cannot walk, cannot speak, and the hands and feet are paralyzed and unable to move; this falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;earth granary.&quot; </p>
<p>If the weakness does not interact, the &quot;tai bai&quot; (great white) governs it.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Weakness and cold lead to numbness in the body; the hands and feet are disproportionately small. First, treat the Jinggu point, then the Zhongfeng and Juegu points, both of which should be drained. </p>
<p>For cold weakness, with the feet and wrists not curling, there is difficulty in standing or rising; pain in the hip joint and foot should be addressed with the Qiu Xu point.</p>
<p>If there is deficiency, there will be weakness and inability to stand; if there is excess, there will be coldness and pain in the shins, with numbness in the body and disproportionately small hands and feet; the Guangming point governs this.</p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: the floating white point is for the feet that are slow and do not bend. </p>
<p>The Tianzhu and Xingjian points are for cases where the feet cannot support the body.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>In cases of weakness in the legs, the feet cannot find stability, and the shins feel weak and cannot stand for long. In the middle regions, the feet feel hot below, the shins cold, and one cannot stand for long; dampness and paralysis prevent movement. Points such as Chongyang, Sanli, Pusan, Feiyang, Fulai, and Wanggu are associated with leg weakness and inability to hold one’s footing. Dazang and Taiquan relate to leg weakness and difficulty in walking.</p>
<p>The point of Guangming concerns weakness that leaves one unable to rise from a sitting position. Points like Tiaokou, Sanli, Chengshan, and Chengjin deal with heat in the lower legs, making it hard to stand for a long time. Fengshi concerns both knees cramping, pain radiating to the side, stiffness, and a weak limb, which may appear blue, scorched, withered, or dark like rotting wood. Points such as Ququan, Fuyang, Tianchi, Daju, Zhigou, Xiaohai, Juegu, and Qiangu are related to the inability of the limbs to lift.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states that needling for weakness should be brief: if lung heat causes the lungs to become dry and lead to wheezing, resulting in weakness akin to paralysis, with a pale complexion and the hair becoming disheveled, one should invigorate the area near the fish border and regulate the source point Taiyuan until the autumn season ends the illness. If heart heat gives rise to pulse weakness, with symptoms like blood in urine or joint fractures that do not align, the shins may suffer and lack support; if the color is red and the veins appear swollen, one should nourish the area around Laogong and regulate the source point Daling until the summer season ends the illness.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>When heat of the liver causes muscle atrophy, with downward discharge, bitter taste in the mouth, tight and spasmodic muscles, a pale complexion and dry nails, nourish its essence and regulate Tai Chong point, and the illness will be resolved by spring. </p>
<p>When heat of the spleen leads to muscle atrophy, accompanied by thirst, loss of sensation in the muscles, a yellow complexion and twitching, nourish its essence at Da Du point, and regulate Tai Bai point, and the illness will be resolved by mid-summer.</p>
<p>When heat of the kidneys results in bone atrophy, weakness in the legs, inability to lift the waist and spine, dry bones with diminished marrow, a dark complexion and brittle teeth, nourish its essence at Ran Gu point, and regulate Tai Xi point, and the illness will be resolved by winter.</p>
<p>For weak and powerless legs, difficulty in walking, moxa on Tai Chong and Li Dui is advised, and also apply moxa on Feng Shi.</p>
<p>Another method: take five points on Tai Chong, drain eight and absorb, avoid moxa. Also take five points on Zhong Feng, drain eight and absorb; for San Li, one inch, drain ten and absorb.</p>
<p>Another method: moxa at half a point on Gong Sun; also take points at San Li, Jue Gu, and Shen Mai; if symptoms persist, take Kun Lun and Yang Fu.</p>
<p>For paralysis of both legs with weakness, apply moxa at He Ding, seven times, at the tip of the kneecap.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Nourishing Life&quot; states: What the world suffers from are the afflictions of the four elements, manifesting as paralysis and illness. It is said that they are akin to guests of Yama. Why is this so? Because the afflictions reach an extreme, and no medical remedies can save them. These ailments arise from the six desires and seven emotions, influenced by the sun and moon, resulting in a depletion of the original essence and a deficiency of vital energy. When the physician employs only herbs from earth, stone, grass, and wood, how can they possibly replenish the primordial life? Thus, in the first volume of the &quot;Suwen,&quot; it is discussed that tranquility and non-action, along with a gathered spirit and interior preservation, are to cultivate true energy through stillness. Furthermore, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions acupuncture and moxibustion as methods to regulate energy, capable of addressing stubborn ailments, where the eight methods of movement can abruptly awaken deep-seated illnesses. This can be seen in the ancient medical texts, which emphasize addressing the root of the ailment through the regulation of energy, achieving evident effects.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>Acupuncture has the effectiveness of tonification and purgation. The method of respiration related to the source gates allows for the circulation of energy. The principles of the bear and the bird can target both exterior and interior issues. Utilizing both methods instead of needles ultimately relates to the body and harmonizes with the universe, achieving a unified qi. If one can skillfully practice this, then even serious conditions may be treated without medication, which is to treat a person&#39;s body with the way of that person.</p>
<p>The method of guiding and pulling, initially aimed to focus solely on seated exercises, has removed the guiding instruction. However, novice practitioners or those unable to perform these techniques can still learn and achieve healing without medicine during illness. </p>
<p>For instance, if there is an affliction in the right hand, point the right fingers toward the right side, turning the head and looking to the left. The same applies for issues on the left. Perform the respiratory technique twenty-four times. If the left foot is affected, sit on a flat bench, place the left foot on the right knee, hold the heel with the left hand, and pull the toes with the right hand while turning the head to the left. The same applies to the right. Using force to pull can eliminate ailments caused by wind, cold, heat, and dampness and can address both recent and longstanding paralysis—this is invariably effective.</p>
<p>In close practices, three lifts and three swallows, returning thoughts to the source, accumulating qi in a cycle, if the left side&#39;s energy is obstructed, focus the practice on the left hand; the same applies to the right side. Each side must circulate qi with diligent effort for a hundred days to fully open the meridians.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The &quot;Fei Xue Lu&quot; states: A girl from a wealthy family in the same county as Ge Kejiu was about seventeen or eighteen years old. Her limbs were weak and withered, unable to feed herself, and her eyes were wide open. Many doctors could not cure her, so they called for Ge Kejiu. He looked at her and smiled, saying, &quot;This is not difficult to treat.&quot; He ordered everything fragrant in her room and the tassels to be removed, made a mound by digging the earth on the floor, carried the girl onto it, locked the door, and instructed her family to observe for movement in her hands and feet and to report to him. After a while, her hands and feet indeed moved, and she cried out. He threw a medicine ball, and the next day she was able to walk out from the mound. It was because this girl had a strong desire for fragrance, which had eroded her spleen due to its vapors.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ru Men Shi Qin&quot; states: Three soldiers in Wanqiu were all suffering from atrophy and had not healed for many years. They had swelling and pain below the waist, sores all over their bodies, dim vision, dry lips, and a thirsty tongue, and they sought treatment from a doctor named Dai. Dai wanted to prescribe a purgative, but the two did not comply, as they were misled by other doctors on warm and tonifying medicine, and both died. A fellow patient, Song Ziyu, soon realized, &quot;They have already died from heat; I must change the treatment.&quot; He respectfully invited Dai. Dai said, &quot;Your illness has been treated with warm medicine for a long time; we must first get rid of that harmful medicine before addressing the root of the illness. I can prescribe a purgative of three hundred measures.&quot; Ziyu said, &quot;I respectfully follow your guidance.&quot; First, a massive dose of pills and Jun Chuan powder was given for purging, about a basin&#39;s worth, and reduced by a third the next day. His legs, which had previously felt numb, began to feel painful and itchy, and it wasn&#39;t until three hundred measures later that he finally felt at ease. Dai remarked, &quot;For atrophy, we should focus on the Yangming channel, which corresponds to the stomach and large intestine.&quot; This indicates that addressing the illness involves both acupuncture and medicine equally.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>A soldier named Song Ziyu from Chen, stationed in the city of Xi, suddenly fell ill with paralysis in June, unable to use his waist, knees, and legs, rendering him unable to walk. He sought treatment from me. Upon examining his pulse in both hands, it was slippery, large, and strong. I recalled the Inner Canon&#39;s teaching that internal fire can cause imbalances leading to cold conditions. Thus, I used salty water to penetrate his diaphragm and assess the presence of cold and retained phlegm; if there was retained food or drink in the upper abdomen, it could be expelled. Once the retained phlegm was eliminated, we then proceeded to purge. In the fluctuating intervals, he felt increasingly clear-minded, his appetite improved daily, and he gradually regained movement in his legs, with his knees extending as well. His heart energy was descending while his kidney energy was rising. I subsequently prescribed a decoction of Huang Lian to detoxify, adding Dang Gui and other herbs, along with Xie Xin Tang, Liang Ge San, and Chai Hu Yin Zi, preparing strong decoctions for him to sip on regularly.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: The Secretary Shuping&#39;s feet, below the ankles, always felt warm. In winter, he could not add cotton on top, often saying, &quot;I am robust and fear not the cold.&quot; I said: This is the deficiency of the three yin in the feet; it is advisable to cut off desires early, to nourish the yin and blood, so that he might be spared. He laughed and did not respond. At the age of fifty, he suffered from atrophy for half a year and died.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; says: The gentleman Wu from Dongyang, fifty years old, was stout and indulgent, often anxious and angry. His pulse was always deep and slippery. Starting from spring, he fell ill with phlegm and qi. The physician diagnosed him as having deficiency and cold, and mostly prescribed warming and drying fragrant medications. By April, his legs weakened, qi surged upward, and his appetite diminished, so he called me for treatment. I said: This is heat stagnation with spleen deficiency; symptoms of atrophy and weakness have developed. Although stout with a deep pulse, it is not a definite sign of death. However, the medication was overly fiery and at this time of excessive heat, survival was indeed difficult. I prescribed two pounds of bamboo juice with Bai Zhu paste, which helped lower qi and improve food intake. A month later, he sweated profusely and died. I write this as a warning for wise individuals, to avoid following the same path.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Cases&quot; states: A scholar with a weak kidney due to accumulated labor had atrophy in his legs and could not walk; later, he became mute and had a dark complexion. I diagnosed him with kidney qi deficiency and cold, unable to circulate to the affected areas. I treated him with the Di Huang Yinzi and he recovered. Later, he carelessly regulated himself and relapsed. He used something similar to Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan, which caused significant phlegm and heat, resembling a stroke. Using medications to dispel wind and transform phlegm resulted in difficult urination and dryness of the mouth and tongue. I then used the previous decoction along with adjusted Ba Wei Wan, and he gradually improved; ultimately, I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and he was cured.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　指风痹痿厥近世差元说</p>
<p>　　风痹痿厥四论，《内经》言之详矣。今余又为之说，不亦赘乎？曰：非赘也。为近世不读《内经》者，指其差元也。夫风痹痿厥四证，本自不同，而近世不能辨，一概作风冷治之，下虚补之，此所以旷日弥年而不愈者也。夫四末之疾，动而或劲者为风，不仁或痛者为痹，弱而不用者为痿，逆而寒热者为厥，此其状未尝同也。故其本源，又复大异。风者必风热相兼；痹者必风湿寒相合；痿者必火乘金；厥者，或寒或热皆从下起。今之治者，不察其源，见其手足亸曳，便谓之风。然《左传》谓风淫末疾。岂不知风暑燥湿火寒六气，皆能为四末之疾也哉？敢详条于左，有意于救物者，试择焉可也。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>痿之为状，两足痿弱不能行用，由肾水不能胜心火，心火上烁肺金，肺金受火制，六叶皆焦，皮毛虚弱急而薄者，则生痿躄。躄者，足不能伸而行步难。盖肾乃肺金之子也。今肾水衰少，随火上炎，肾主髓，火炽则髓竭，由使内太过而致。然至真要大论云：诸痿喘呕皆属于上者，上焦也。三焦者，手少阳相火也。痿喘呕三病皆在膈上，属肺金之部分也。故肌痹传为脉痿，湿痹不仁传为肉痿，髓竭足躄传为骨痿，房室太过传为筋痿，传为白淫。大抵痿之为病，皆因客热而成，好淫贪色，强力过极，渐成痿疾。故痿躄属肺，脉痿属心，筋痿属肝，肉痿属脾，骨痿属肾。总因肺受火热叶焦之故，相传于四脏，痿病成矣。直断曰，痿病无寒。故痿之作也，五月六月七月，皆其时也。午者少阴君火之位，未者湿土庚金伏火之地，申者少阳相火之分，故痿发此三月之内以为热也。故病痿之人，其脉浮而大。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>今之用药者，凡见脚膝痿弱，难于行步，或一足不伸，便作寒湿脚气治之，骤用乌、附、乳、没、自然铜、威灵仙之类，燔针艾火，汤煮袋蒸，痿弱转加，如此而死，岂亦天乎？夫治痿与治痹，其治颇异。风寒湿痹，犹可蒸汤灸燔，时或一效，惟痿用之转甚者，何也？盖痿以肺热为本叶焦而成，以此传于五脏，岂有寒者欤？若痿作寒治，是不刃而杀之也。夫痿病不死，死者用药之误也。陈下一武弁宋子玉因驻军息城，五六月间，暴得痿病，腰胯两足皆不任用，躄而不行，求治于予。察其两手，脉俱滑数而有力，予凭《内经》火淫于内治以咸寒，以盐水越其膈间寒热宿痰。新者为热，旧者为寒，或宿食宿饮在上脘者，皆可用之。宿痰既尽，因而下之，节次数十行，觉神志日清，饮食日美，两足渐举，脚膝渐伸，心降肾升，便继以黄连解毒汤加当归等药，及泻心汤、凉膈散、柴胡饮子大作剂煎，时时呷之。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>经曰：治心肺之病最近，用药剂不厌频而少；治肾肝之病最远，用药剂不厌顿而多。此法人皆怪之，然余治痿，寻常用之如拾遗物。余若以此诳人，其如获罪于天何？此宋子玉之证，所以不得不书也，且示信于来世。故《内经》谓治痿之法独取阳明经，阳明经者胃脉也，五脏六腑之海也，主润养宗筋，宗筋主束骨，束骨在脐下阴毛际上是也。又主大利机关，机关者身中大关节也，以司曲伸，是以阳明虚则宗脉纵，宗脉纵则大脉不伸，两足痿弱。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>然取阳明者则胃脉也。胃为水谷之海，人之四季，以胃气为本，本固则精化，精化则髓充，髓充则足能履也。阴阳应象论曰：形不足者温之以气，精不足者补之以味。味者五味也，五味调和，则可补精益气也。五味，五谷、五菜、五果、五肉。，五味贵和，不可偏胜。又曰：恬淡虚无，真气从之，精神内守，病安从来？若用金石草木补之者，必久而增气。物化之常，气增而久，夭之由也。所以久服黄连、苦参者而反化为热，久服热药之人，可不为寒心哉！<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>　　　　东垣十书 【元　李杲】</p>

<p>　　痿者，手足痿软而无力，百节缓纵而不收也。圣人以痿病在诸证为切要，故特着篇目，分五脏之热名病，其所属皮脉筋肉骨之痿，致足不任于地，及叙五脏得热之邪，则以一脏因一邪所伤。观其微旨，是用五志五劳六淫，从脏气所要者，各举其一以为例耳。若会通八十一篇而言，便见五劳五志六淫，尽得成五脏之热以为痿也。<a id="orig-28p" href="#trans-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>何则？言肺气热则皮痿，因有所失亡，所求不得者；与他篇之谓始富后贫，虽不伤邪，皮焦筋屈，痿躄为挛者，同是一于七情之不扬，若病机之谓诸痿喘呕，诸气愤郁，皆属于上者言之，即此可推何热而不为痿，何脉而不为热也？如言心气热为脉痿，因得之悲哀太甚，阳气内动而血崩，大经空虚，乃为脉痿。此以心为神明之官，主脉为要者言也。及乎推之五脏各有神，各有志。若怒则气上逆，甚则呕血之类，亦五志所动。以热伤血，血逆行于经脉，亦必空虚，有若形乐志苦。病生于脉产则是五志皆得以痿其脉，不独悲哀一因也。且五志之在各脏，自伤其所属。若怒甚筋纵，其若不容，与形乐志乐，病生于肉，形苦志乐，病生于筋。<a id="orig-29p" href="#trans-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>又若忧恐喜怒，因太虚则五脏相乘，故病有五五二十五变，皆至于大骨枯槁，大肉陷下之病，其神志在五脏之为热病者，不可胜计。如言肝脏气热，因思想无穷，所愿不得，犹肺之所求不得也。其入房太甚，宗筋弛纵，亦犹肾之远行劳倦也。即此可见五劳各得伤其五脏所合之皮肉筋骨矣。如言脾脏气热，因得之有渐于湿，以水为事者。若岁运太阴湿土，司天在泉之湿，皆致肌肉痿，足痿不收，此是从五脏中举外感者为例耳。诸脏皆然。<a id="orig-30p" href="#trans-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>少阴之复为骨痿；少阳之复为脉痿；阳明司天之政，四之气亦为骨痿；厥阴司天，风气下临，脾气上从而为肌肉痿。有因于湿，首如裹，湿热不攘，大筋软短，小筋弛长，软短为拘，弛长为痿。《灵枢》有八风之变，或伤筋，或伤肉，或伤骨，与邪客筋骨间者，热多则筋弛骨消肉烁。夫其外淫而生五脏痿病者如此。然有不言邪，止从经脏之虚而论者。谓脾病者，身重肌肉痿，足痿不收，行善瘈；谓肾虚者为跛为痱；谓三阳有余三阴不足为偏枯；谓足少阳之别虚则痿蹶，坐不能起；足阳明之别，虚则足不收，胫枯；又有饮食所伤，味过于咸则大骨气劳，味过于辛则筋脉沮弛，与夫膏粱之人，病偏枯痿厥。<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>已上所陈，止就本条足痿不用者言耳。至若五脏尽热，神昏仆倒，手足俱不用，世俗所谓瘫痪者，岂非亦是痿之大者也。又若下条肺痿之为脏病者，而经又有心气痿者死，则是五脏尽有其痿，盖可知矣。《原病式》论小便遗失，谓肺热客于肾部，干于足厥阴之经，而气血不得宣通则痿痹，故神无所用而不遂其机，因致溲便遗失。由是论之，凡神机气血，或劣弱，或闭塞，即脏腑经络四属，若内若外，随处而不用。故《内经》重其事，迭出诸篇，后之览者，竟失其旨。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>集方论者，或并见虚劳证，或并见风门，赖丹溪始发挥千余年之误，表而出之，而复语焉不详，可惜也。曰：痿论阳明冲脉，合宗筋会于气街，因阳明虚，故宗筋纵，带脉不引而足痿，所以独取阳明。今子历陈受病之邪及诸痿证，又将若何治之？曰：圣人凡语其一，推之而可十可百，岂惟足痿而已乎？所谓各补其荣而通其俞，谓其虚实，和其逆顺者，则治邪之法，尽在其中矣。所云饬脉骨肉，各以其时受月则病已者，治四属内外诸痿之法，亦在其中矣。然而诸痿之病，未有不因阳明虚而得者。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>何以言之？按《灵枢》有谓真气所受于天，与谷气并而充身也。又谓谷始入于胃之两焦，以溉五脏，别出两行荣卫之道，其大气之搏而不行者，积于胸中，命曰气海。《素问》则谓足太阴者三阴也，其脉贯胃属脾络嗌，故太阴为之行气于三阴。阳明者，表也，五脏六腑之海也，亦为之行气于三阳，脏腑各因其经而受气于阳明，故为胃行其津液。四肢不得禀水谷气，日以益衰，阴道不利，筋骨肌肉，无气以生，故不用焉。而冲脉者出于肾下，与任脉起于胞中，治血海，亦云为五脏六腑之海也，五脏六腑皆禀焉。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>其上行者渗三阳灌诸精，其下行者，渗三阴灌诸络，而温肌肉，与阳明宗筋会于气冲，因言阳明虚则宗筋纵，带脉不引，故足痿不用也。即此而观，真气者天之道也，谷气者地之道也。地非天不生，天非地不成，是故真气与谷气并而后生成，形气之道立矣。故阳明虚，于五脏无所禀，则不能行血气，营阴阳，濡筋骨，利关节，气海无所受，则卫气不能温分肉，充皮肤，肥腠理，司开阖。血海无所受，则上下内外之络脉空虚，于是精神气血之奉生身周于性命者劣弱矣。故百体中随其不得受水谷气处，则不用而为痿，治痿不独取阳明而何哉！<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>
<p>　　　　　论证</p>
<p>　　痿证之义，《内经》言之详矣。观所列五脏之证，皆言为热，而五脏之证，又总由肺热叶焦，以致金燥水亏，乃成痿证。如丹溪之论治，诚得之矣。然细察经文，又曰：悲哀太甚则胞络绝，传为脉痿，思想无穷，所愿不得，发为筋痿，有渐于湿，以水为事，发为肉痿之类，则又非尽为火证。此其有余不尽之意，犹有可知。故因此而生火者有之，因此而败伤元气者亦有之。元气败伤，则精虚不能灌溉，血虚不能营养者，亦不少矣。<a id="orig-36p" href="#trans-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>若概从火论，则恐真阳亏败，及土衰水涸者，有不能堪。故当酌寒热之浅深，审虚实之缓急，以施治疗，庶得治痿之全矣。　　经曰：湿热不攘，则大筋软短，小筋弛长，软短为拘，弛长为痿。此《内经》言筋病之溉，乃举隅之谈，以启人之自反耳。非谓大筋必无弛长，小筋必无软短也。即如痿弱，必由于弛长，岂大筋果无涉乎？此经言之意，从可知矣。故于痿证之外，凡遇瘈瘲等病，当知拘挛者必由软短，瘫弱者必由弛长，斯得《内经》之意，而于寒热燥湿之辨，亦可得其据矣。<a id="orig-37p" href="#trans-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　凡痿由湿热，脉洪滑而证多烦热者，必当先去其火，宜二妙散，随证加减用之。若阴虚兼热者，宜《正传》加味四物汤、虎胫骨丸，或丹溪补阴丸、滋阴八味丸之类主之。若绝无火证，而止因水亏于肾，血亏于肝者，则不宜兼用凉药以伐生气，惟鹿角胶丸为最善，或加味四斤丸、八味地黄丸、金刚丸之类，俱可择用。若阴虚无湿或多汗者，俱不宜轻用苍朮。盖痿证最忌散表，亦恐伤阴也。　　东垣取黄蘗为君，黄芪等补药辅佐，以治诸痿，无一定之方。有兼痰积者，有湿多热多者，有湿热相半者，有挟气者，临病制方，其亦治痿之良法也。<a id="orig-38p" href="#trans-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>　　《纂要》云：湿热，东垣健步丸加燥湿降火之剂，黄蘗、黄芩、苍朮。湿痰，二陈汤加苍朮、白朮、黄芩、黄蘗之类，入竹沥、姜汁。血虚，四物加苍朮、黄蘗，下补阴丸。气虚，四君子加苍朮、黄芩、黄蘗。盖黄蘗、苍朮，治痿要药也。已上方治虽所主有不同，而降火清金，所谓治法之大要，无不同也。　　陈无择曰：人身有皮毛、血脉、筋膜、肌肉、骨髓以成其形，内则有肝心脾肺肾以主之。若随情妄用喜怒劳佚，以致内脏精血虚耗，使血脉筋骨肌肉痿弱无力以运动，故致痿躄，状与柔风脚气相类。柔风脚气，皆外因风寒，正气与邪气相搏，故作肿苦痛，为邪实。痿由内脏不足之所致，但不任用，亦无痛楚，此血气之虚也。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>

<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Four Seasons and Regulation of the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>In the winter month of three, this is the time for closing and storing. The water freezes and the earth cracks; do not disturb the Yang. Go to bed early and rise late, waiting for the sunlight. Make your intentions like those that are hidden and secretive, as if you possess private thoughts or already have achievements. Retreat from the cold and approach the warmth, avoiding any excessive exposure of the skin, so that the vital energy does not hastily diminish. This is the response of winter air and the method of nurturing and storing. Going against this will harm the kidneys, leading to weakness in spring, resulting in fewer offspring.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The kidneys are associated with winter. Opposing the stored energy of winter harms the kidneys, which results in weakness in spring, thus leading to fewer offspring. The liver, representing wood, thrives in winter water and governs the energy and nourishment of spring, vital for the tendons. If the tendons lose their nourishment, weakness arises; if the vital energy descends violently, it leads to weakness.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Vital Energy Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>Due to dampness, the head feels wrapped; if damp heat is not expelled, the major tendons are soft and short, while the minor tendons are slack and long. Softness and shortness cause contraction, while slackness and length lead to paralysis. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The dampness obstructs the vital Yang energy, hence the head feels wrapped. When Yang energy is weak, it fails to nourish the tendons; therefore, major tendons become soft and short, while minor tendons elongate and slacken. The major tendons are connected to the minor tendons within the bones and joints, thus they become soft and short due to stagnant heat; externally, dampness causes them to be slack and long. Shortness results in spasms, while length leads to abandonment.</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Distinctions between Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When the Three Yang energies are affected, symptoms include chills and fever, abscesses and swellings, as well as paralysis and numbness.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Three Yang refers to the Sun Yang. The Sun Yang is the master of all Yang energies and governs the tendons; when the tendons are injured, it results in paralysis, and when the energy is harmed, it leads to numbness. When the Three Yang and Three Yin are ill, it results in partial atrophy and easy paralysis, causing the limbs to be motionless.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Three Yang and Three Yin refers to the Sun and the Greater Yin. If the Sun Yang is deficient, it leads to partial atrophy, and if Yang is deficient and fails to nourish the tendons, it results in paralysis. The spleen pertains to the limbs, thus they become immobile.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What causes atrophy in the five organs?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The lungs govern the skin and hair, the heart governs the blood vessels, the liver governs the tendons and membranes, the spleen governs the muscles, and the kidneys govern the bone marrow. Thus, when the lung heat causes dryness, the skin and hair are weakened and thin, which results in atrophy and paralysis.</p>
<p>[Note: The ability of the body to move and act comes from the nourishment of the internal organs to the tendons, blood vessels, bones, and muscles. When the internal organs are diseased, the exterior of the body is atrophied. Lung heat leads to dryness and thinness of the skin, and since the skin relies on the lungs for nourishment, when the skin is thin, the essence and fluids cannot circulate, resulting in overheating of the five organs and consequently atrophy and paralysis.]</p>
<p>When heart qi is hot, the lower vessels are constricted and the upper vessels are weak. When the upper is weak, there arises atrophy in the vessels, causing joints to be unsteady and the shins to be slack and unable to support the body.</p>
<p>[Note: When heart qi is hot, the qi rises and causes the pulse to become constricted in the upper body. The heart governs the vessels, hence the qi of the pulse turns constricted and rises, leading to weakness in the pulses below. When the meridians are weak, the joints below become unstable; since the joints are unsteady, the tendons and bones loosen, causing the shins to become slack and unable to support the ground.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When liver qi is heated, it causes the gallbladder to leak, resulting in a bitter mouth; the fascia becomes dry, and when the fascia is dry, the tendons become tense and cramp, leading to tendon atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: The gallbladder is attached to the liver, and when liver qi is heated, bile leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth. When bile leaks, the fascia cannot be nourished and dries out, hence the tension and cramps leading to tendon atrophy.)</p>
<p>When spleen qi is heated, it leads to a dry stomach and thirst; the muscles become numb, leading to muscle atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: The qi of the spleen and stomach governs the muscles. When the yangming fluids do not produce, and the taiyin qi does not arrive, the muscles become numb and lead to muscle atrophy.)</p>
<p>When kidney qi is heated, the lower back and spine cannot rise, the bones become frail, and the marrow diminishes, leading to bone atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: Kidney heat depletes fluids; the lower back is the orifice of the kidneys, therefore the lower back and spine cannot extend, leading to diminished marrow and frail bones resulting in bone atrophy.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How does one come to this? Qi Bo said: The lungs are the master of the viscera and cover the heart. When something is lost, and what one seeks cannot be obtained, the lungs become noisy; when they are noisy, the lung heat causes the leaves to wither. Therefore, it is said that the five viscera suffer from lung heat causing withering and paralysis—this is what it means. </p>
<p>(Note: When something is lost, and what one seeks cannot be attained, the heart’s spirit becomes unsettled, and the fire qi rises.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs are the covering of the heart. When metal (the lungs) suffers the fire’s punishment, it leads to wheezing. If the lungs become overheated and dry, there is no way for the fluids to circulate, resulting in heat affecting all five organs. Excessive sorrow can sever the channels, and when they are severed, the yang energy stirs within. This can lead to a collapse beneath the heart, manifesting as blood in the urine. Therefore, this condition is called “the great vessels are empty,” which manifests as muscle atrophy and is transmitted as pulse weakness. Endless thoughts and unfulfilled wishes lead to excessive external desires, causing the tendons to loosen and resulting in muscle atrophy and excessive lust. Thus, it is stated in the lower classic: “Muscle atrophy arises from the liver.” This is related to dampness; if moisture lingers and the environment is damp, the flesh becomes soaked, leading to numbness and resulting in flesh atrophy. Therefore, it is stated in the lower classic: “Flesh atrophy arises from damp conditions.” Long journeys leading to fatigue, encountering great heat and thirst, can internally consume the yang energy. When it is consumed, heat lodges in the kidneys, which are the water organs. If water cannot withstand fire, bones will become withered and marrow will be depleted, leading to an inability of the feet to support the body, resulting in bone atrophy. Therefore, it is stated in the lower classic: “Bone atrophy arises from great heat.” </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Chong vessel originates from the center of the womb and is considered the sea of the twelve meridians. The heart governs the blood vessels; therefore, if the collateral of the womb is blocked, the heart qi becomes deficient and moves internally. When the heart qi moves, it leads to a downward flow resulting in frequent urination of blood. If there is a deficiency of blood in the exterior vessels, it leads to muscular paralysis, while a deficiency of blood in the internal vessels results in weakness of the pulse. The blood lost in urination can damage the skin and affect the qi and blood in the meridians. Thus, it is said that the great vessels are empty. Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires can harm liver qi. Those who indulge excessively can experience intense desire leading to spontaneous emission. If there is residual dampness and one resides in a low and moist environment, the combination of internal and external dampness can cause the muscles to become soft and numb, leading to muscular atrophy. Long journeys and exhaustion can harm the kidneys; exposure to extreme heat can damage the yin, and thirst can deplete the yin fluids. Therefore, the yang heat can attack the yin, causing heat to accumulate in the kidneys. Now, with excessive yang and depleted yin, water cannot withstand fire, leading to dryness of the bones and deficiency of the marrow, resulting in inability to support oneself, causing bone atrophy. The emperor asked, &quot;How can one differentiate these conditions?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Lung heat presents with pale complexion and damaged hair; heart heat shows a red complexion with engorged vessels; liver heat has a greenish hue with brittle nails; spleen heat exhibits a yellow color with twitching flesh; kidney heat appears black with decayed teeth.&quot;<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What floats externally permeates the valleys, merging with Yangming at the governing vessel. The Shaoyin, Taiyin, and Yangming channels converge at the governing vessel, following the abdomen upwards and meeting at the Qi street, which is governed by Yangming; hence, Yangming is its chief. The three Yin and three Yang, twelve primary channels, along with the extraordinary channels Ren, Du, and Chong, flow up and down, all pertained to the constraints of the Dai channel. The Du channel originates at the perineum, bifurcating into Ren and Chong, ascending along the back and abdomen; thus, Ren, Chong, Shaoyin, and Yangming are all interconnected with the Du channel. Yangming is the sea of food and fluids, governing the nourishment of the governing vessel; if deficient, the governing vessel relaxes, unable to bind the bones, leading to dysfunction in the limbs, resulting in atrophy; if the Dai channel fails to extend, the channels below slacken, causing the feet to weaken and become unusable. This explains why atrophy specifically pertains to Yangming. The Emperor asked: How can one differentiate? Qibo replied: In cases of lung heat, the complexion is pale with hair loss; in cases of heart heat, the complexion is red with engorged vessels; in cases of liver heat, the complexion is bluish with brittle nails; in cases of spleen heat, the complexion is yellow with muscle twitching; in cases of kidney heat, the complexion is dark with decayed teeth. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The emperor said: &quot;As you have stated, it is acceptable. Regarding the treatment of atrophy, why do we specifically focus on Yangming?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, responsible for nourishing the primary tendons, which bind the bones and facilitate movement. The Chong vessel is the sea of the meridians, responsible for moistening and irrigating the valleys. It connects with Yangming at the primary tendons.

Yangming is the sea of water and grain, responsible for nourishing the tendons and ligaments.

<p><strong>On the Matters of Confucian Filial Piety by Zhang Congzheng</strong></p>
<p>The four conditions of wind, bi syndrome, atrophy, and syncope are described in detail in the Inner Canon. To elaborate further may seem redundant, but it is not. This is for those in modern times who do not read the Inner Canon and misinterpret its essential meanings. The four conditions of wind, bi, atrophy, and syncope are fundamentally different, yet modern practitioners fail to distinguish them, treating them all as cold due to wind and addressing the deficiency with tonics. This misunderstanding leads to prolonged suffering without resolution. The diseases of the extremities manifest differently: the vigorous ones indicate wind, the numb or painful suggest bi syndrome, weakness and lack of use correspond to atrophy, and the cold or heat that inversely occur indicate syncope. Their root causes are also vastly different. Wind is often a combination of wind and heat; bi syndrome involves wind, dampness, and cold; atrophy arises from fire overcoming metal; and syncope can originate from either cold or heat, both arising from below. Current practitioners overlook these origins and mistakenly assign the label of wind upon seeing hands and feet drooping. Yet, as stated in the Zuo Zhuan, wind can lead to myriad diseases of the extremities. Are we not aware that the six atmospheric factors of heat, dryness, dampness, fire, and cold can all cause these four extremity illnesses? I dare to elaborate further in the Zuo Zhuan for those eager to save lives; one may choose wisely from it.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of weakness, known as &quot;wei,&quot; manifests as feeble legs that can hardly walk. This is due to the kidney essence (water) being unable to dominate the heart fire. The heart fire rises to disturb the lung metal, which in turn, is restrained by this fire. The six branches (corresponding to the six organs) then become scorched, leading to a weakness of the skin and hair, resulting in the development of wei. </p>
<p>&quot;Zha&quot; (or “leg weakness”) refers to an inability of the legs to stretch or move properly. The kidney is considered the offspring of the lung&#39;s metal. When the kidney water is diminished, it allows the fire to rise uncontrollably. The kidney governs the marrow, and if the fire is excessive, it depletes the marrow, which leads to an internal excess causing this condition. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Essential Treatise on the True and Great,&quot; both wei and conditions of breathlessness and vomiting pertain to the upper region (upper jiao). The three jiaos represent the hand&#39;s lesser yang and fire. The ailments of wei, breathlessness, and vomiting all exist above the diaphragm and are associated with the lung metal. Thus, muscle weakness leading to pulse weakness is termed &quot;pulse wei,&quot; dampness leading to numbness is termed &quot;flesh wei,&quot; marrow depletion causing leg weakness is termed &quot;bone wei,&quot; and excess in the chamber leads to tendon weakness.</p>
<p>Overall, the causes of wei as a disease are due to excess heat affecting the body, indulgence in desires, excessive force, gradually leading to the condition of wei. Therefore, wei in various forms is associated with the lung, pulse wei with the heart, tendon wei with the liver, flesh wei with the spleen, and bone wei with the kidney. The underlying reason is that the lung is affected by heat, causing its leaves to wither, transmitting this heat to the four organs, resulting in the development of the disease. It is clearly stated that wei conditions do not arise from cold.</p>
<p>Thus, the occurrence of wei is particularly notable in the months of May, June, and July. &quot;Wu&quot; (midday) is designated as the position of the lesser yin fire, &quot;wei&quot; (the earth element) is where dampness, metal, and fire intertwine, and &quot;shen&quot; (the evening) relates to the lesser yang fire. Hence, wei arises during these three months due to heat. Consequently, those suffering from wei will have a pulse that is superficial and large.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nowadays, those who use medicine often see weakness in the knees and legs, difficulty in walking, or one foot unable to extend, and treat it as cold and damp foot bi-syndrome. They hastily use herbs like black, aconite, milk, myrrh, natural copper, and king&#39;s herb, applying fire from moxa needles, boiling, and steaming with pouches. The weakness worsens, and they die—could this be fate? The treatment for weakness and blockage differs greatly. Wind, cold, and damp blockage can still be treated with steaming, boiling, and moxibustion, and may sometimes yield results. However, using such methods for weakness only aggravates the condition—why is that? Weakness stems from heat in the lungs, leading to a &#39;burnt leaf&#39; condition, which transmits to the five organs; could there be any cold? Treating weakness as a cold condition is akin to killing without a blade. Weakness does not lead to death; deaths arise from erroneous medication. </p>
<p>Once, a soldier named Song Ziyu stationed in Xi City, unexpectedly developed weakness during May and June, unable to use his waist and legs, becoming bedridden. He sought my treatment. Examining his hands, both pulses were slippery and rapid yet strong. I relied on the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; principles that fire indulgence leads to internal heat while causing coldness around the diaphragm due to phlegm.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: To treat diseases of the heart and lungs, the methods are closest; therefore, medications should be used frequently but in small doses. To treat diseases of the kidneys and liver, the methods are furthest; hence, medications may be used less frequently but in larger quantities. Many people find this surprising, yet when I treat atrophy, I commonly apply these methods as if picking up lost items. If I were to deceive others with this, would it not be akin to incurring divine wrath? This is the evidence of Song Ziyu, thus it must be recorded and shown as a testament for future generations. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states that the method for treating atrophy uniquely utilizes the Yangming channel, which is the stomach vessel, the sea of the five organs and six bowels, responsible for nourishing the foundational tendons. The foundational tendons govern the binding of bones, which are located below the navel and above the pubic hair. Additionally, it governs great bodily movements; these movements are the major joints of the body that regulate bending and stretching. Thus, if Yangming is deficient, the foundational tendons become lax; if the foundational tendons are lax, the major vessels do not extend, resulting in weakness and atrophy of the legs.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

With the qi of the stomach as the foundation, if the foundation is strong, then essence can transform; when essence transforms, marrow is nourished; and when marrow is nourished, one can move freely. According to the theory of Yin and Yang correspondence: if one’s form is inadequate, it should be warmed with qi; if essence is lacking, it should be replenished with flavor. Flavor refers to the five tastes; when the five tastes are harmonized, they can replenish essence and enhance qi. The five tastes come from five grains, five vegetables, five fruits, and five kinds of meat. The five tastes value harmony and should not overly favor one. Moreover, it is said: tranquility and emptiness lead to the true qi, and the spirit is internally contained; how can illness arise? If one supplements with metals, stones, grasses, and woods, it will surely increase qi over time. The natural course of transformation results in increased qi over a long duration, leading to premature decline.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Effects of Damp Heat Leading to Atrophy of the Lungs and the Reception of Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>Between June and July, dampness prevails, allowing the child to generate abundant heat for the mother. The combination of damp and heat injures the metal (lungs) and severely affects the large intestine, thus cold and cool treatments are required to counteract it. The dry metal succumbs to the damp heat pathogen, severing the source of cold water that supports transformation. When the source is cut off, the kidneys become deficient, leading to severe cases of atrophy and paralysis—resulting in weakness and inability to move from the waist down, and lack of balance in walking, with both feet leaning sideways. Clear and drying decoction should be the remedy.</p>
<p><strong>On Heat Injuries to Gastric Qi</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Needling Intent&quot; states: “When Qi is deficient and the body is hot, it results from heat injury.” The &quot;Atrophy Treatise&quot; mentions: “After long journeys and exertion, encountering excessive heat and thirst, the yang qi suffers internally; when internally attacked, the heat retreats to the kidneys, which are the body&#39;s water organ. Now if water cannot overcome fire, the bones wither and the marrow becomes deficient, leading to limb weakness and resulting in bone atrophy.” Thus, the &quot;Lower Classic&quot; states: “Bone atrophy arises from excessive heat.” This damp heat leads to atrophy, causing weakness and lack of strength in the bones, therefore treatment for atrophy must focus on the Yangming channel. </p>
<p>During the long summer, when damp heat prevails and is intensely strong, many people feel their limbs burdened, spirits low, and sluggishness to movement. Symptoms include fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, heaviness and pain in the joints, sometimes with elevated Qi causing wheezing, body heat and restlessness; distension in the heart region, urine that is yellow and scant, loose stools occurring frequently, possibly with diarrhea of yellowish mucus or resembling rice water, with variations in thirst, disinterest in food, sweating, a heavy body, or diminished sweating—often blood diseases appear prior to Qi deficiency.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>Treatment of Atrophy Syndrome</p>
<p>The atrophy syndrome must not be treated with wind methods or wind medicines.<br>Atrophy syndrome includes damp-heat, damp-phlegm, qi deficiency, blood deficiency, and stagnant blood. For damp-heat, use Dongyuan Jianbu Pill, to dry dampness and reduce yin fire, along with herbs like Atractylodes, Scutellaria, Huangbo, and Achyranthes. For damp-phlegm, use Erchen Decoction with added Atractylodes, Bai Zhu, Scutellaria, Huangbo, Bamboo Juice, and Ginger Juice. For qi deficiency, use Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Scutellaria, Huangbo, and Atractylodes. For blood deficiency, use Four Substance Decoction with added Huangbo and Atractylodes, decoct, and take with Yin Nourishing Pill. There might also be food stagnation and dead blood obstructing downward movement, generally belonging to heat; use Shen Zhu Siwu Decoction, Huangbo, and similar remedies. </p>
<p>Regarding the five forms of atrophy and related syndromes, a special chapter was dedicated, discussing it in detail; later prescriptions often lack focus on this syndrome. The reason stems from confusion with wind stroke categories. Master Danxi laments the longstanding issues, empathizing with those suffering from this ailment, as many misled by incompetent doctors. Those committed to this field must deeply understand it. Indeed, Chen Wuzhe stated that atrophy results from insufficient internal organs, which is quite valid. However, what is insufficient in atrophy is primarily yin blood, yet all these prescriptions mainly aim to tonify yang and replenish qi—how can one avoid the issues of deficiency and excess? Furthermore, Wuzhe’s principles of the three causes in formulating prescriptions could be considered the best amongst all; however, even he was not clear on this syndrome, let alone others.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Overview</strong><br><strong>Compiled by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;In treating atrophy, one only considers the Yangming channel; this seems to suggest a lack of expansion in understanding. Please clarify for me.&quot; I answered: &quot;All forms of atrophy arise from heat in the lungs. Just this one phrase conveys the essence of the treatment method. The classics state: &#39;The east is real while the west is empty; drain the south and nourish the north.&#39; This indeed refers to the concepts of generation and overcoming, and the grand principles are not beyond this. The east corresponds to wood, which is the liver. The west corresponds to metal, which is the lungs. The south corresponds to fire, which is the heart. The north corresponds to water, which is the kidneys. Among the five directions, only fire has dual aspects. Though the kidneys have two, water resides in one of them. Yang is always in excess, while yin is perpetually insufficient. Hence the texts state, &#39;One water cannot overcome two fires,&#39; which is a necessary principle. The nature of metal is dry and resides above, governing qi, and it fears fire. The nature of earth is warm and resides in the center, governing the limbs, and it fears wood. The nature of fire is to ascend; if desires become excessive, then water loses its ability to nourish, and fire, in its fear, becomes diminished and falls prey to what overcomes it. When the lungs are afflicted by fire, they become heated. Wood, having a rigid and abrupt nature, when the lungs are overheated, loses its ability to nourish; similarly, when the spleen is afflicted by wood, it suffers damage. If the lungs are hot, they cannot regulate the entire body. If the spleen is damaged, the limbs cannot function, resulting in all forms of atrophy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the south is purged, then the lung&#39;s metal is clear, but the east remains imbalanced; what harm is there to the spleen? If the north is supplemented, then the heart&#39;s fire diminishes and the west is not empty; what heat is there in the lungs? Thus, when the Yangming is full, the tendons are nourished, capable of binding the bones and benefiting the mechanisms of the body. The methods for treating atrophy do not exceed this. Luo Longji also said: when wind and fire are intense, one should nourish the kidney water. Dr. Dongyuan takes ephedra as the sovereign, with astragalus and other tonics assisting, to treat various forms of atrophy without a fixed method. There are cases with phlegm accumulation, excess dampness, excess heat, a mixture of dampness and heat, and those with Qi entrapment; when faced with illness, the prescription is made based on the symptoms. Those skilled in treating atrophy can manage it well! Nonetheless, if the principles are misapplied, treatment may fail. Heaven produces Yang, thickening the Qi and generating heat; ancient sages stated that for those suffering from atrophy, if they do not restrain their tastes, I know they will not find peace. </p>
<p>When heart heat is severe, the fire uniquely blazes upwards. The kidney&#39;s pulse usually descends, but when fire is intense and ascends, the kidney pulse also rises in accordance with the blazing fire. The Yin Qi rebels; fire inside burns higher; the Yin rises separating from the Yang, failing to maintain its position below. The heart&#39;s Qi flows through the vessels, thus yielding atrophy, the knees and wrists resembling those that have been broken, unable to assist one another; the meridians and tendons slacken and do not support the body. One may descend for hundreds of lines and still recover.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Differentiation of the Treatments for Atrophy Disease and Wind Disease</p>
<p>Based on discussions in Danxi&#39;s writings, atrophy disease and wind disease are treated differently. This is because of the treatment for stroke mentioned in the &quot;Jufang,&quot; where Menglang uses diaphoretic and damp-expelling medicines that harm blood and qi, attacking the root cause, without understanding methods for nourishment. Thus, he references atrophy disease to remedy the shortcomings of the &quot;Jufang,&quot; and his words reflect this perspective. However, the symptoms outlined in the &quot;Jufang&quot; for stroke—such as uncoordinated limbs, needing assistance to stand, mental confusion, and incoherent speech—are indeed similar to those of heat disease as described in the &quot;Neijing.&quot; It is essential to note the differences. The &quot;Zhenjing&quot; states that when genuine qi departs and the pathogenic factor remains, it leads to partial atrophy. The discourse on atrophy indicates that when the Yangming is deficient, the muscles relax, the belt vessel fails to draw, leading to atrophy and inability to use the feet. Thus, it is understood that the uncoordinated limbs in the case of atrophy occur due to obstructing evil qi in the channels, whereas in the case of atrophy disease, it is due to a deficiency in Yangming, muscle relaxation, and failing belt vessel. There are symptoms of erratic will in atrophy disease, but none in true atrophy disease itself. The disease of atrophy is also known as wind atrophy, combining internal injury and external invasion, while atrophy disease is solely induced by internal injury. Wind atrophy occurs due to violent impacts, while atrophy disease develops gradually due to laziness. All of this clarifies that atrophy and atrophy disease are distinct ailments.</p>
<p>From &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot; by Wang Lun, Ming Dynasty.</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Paralysis and weakness are diseases caused by the absence of blood and the combination of phlegm, fire, and damp heat. The ancients said that one should not treat these with wind-dispelling methods, yet they often used wind herbs like Xiao Xu Ming Decoction, West Zhou Xu Ming Decoction, and dispelling wind decoction, which contain ingredients such as Qiang Huo, Fang Feng, Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Wu Tou, and Xi Xin. These herbs disperse wind evils and open the pores. However, improper use may further dry up the yin and blood. </p>
<p>Note: According to previous observations, many cases in Jiangnan are attributed to yin deficiency and qi deficiency, with damp heat affecting the fire. Paralysis and weakness often pertain to the yin deficiency and damp heat in the Yangming channels of the hands and feet, so the diagnosis must be made with care.</p>
<p>Medical Classics Must Read 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi】</p>
<p>General Discussion</p>
<p>It is noted that weakness is a serious illness, hence the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; repeatedly discusses it. Earlier scholars varied in their compilations on this topic, sometimes associating it with deficiency and labor, or with wind and dampness, which strays from the core principles. Only Dan Xi particularly emphasized its significance, though his explanations were somewhat lacking. The classic discusses how the root of diseases involves all five organs but especially emphasizes the Taiyin Lung channel. It also states that while treatment methods involve various channels, special emphasis is placed on the Yangming Stomach channel. </p>
<p>Why this emphasis? The lung, being of the metal element, is dry in nature and is located above, governing the transformation of qi to circulate throughout the body, being sensitive to fire. When the heat and fire of the five organs vaporize, the metal element is weakened, leading to lung heat and damage. Thus, the diseases vary among the five organs but the place of the hand Taiyin is commonly affected. The spleen, being of the earth element, is damp and located centrally, receiving grains and water to nourish the limbs, also being sensitive to the wood element.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the lung meridian is invaded and loses its proper state, the wood is not restrained and insults what it conquers. Therefore, the treatment principles are categorized by the five organs, and no part of the foot yangming is overlooked. Since it is said that the lung is harmed, treatment should focus on the lung. But why does Qibo exclusively select yangming? According to the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; the true qi received from heaven combines with the grain qi to fill the body. If yangming is deficient, the five organs cannot receive their nourishment and cannot circulate blood and qi, nourish the sinews and bones, or benefit the joints. Therefore, when the body is unable to receive food and water, it results in atrophy; it is not merely about selecting yangming. This is why Dancai says: draining the south clears the lung metal, and the east becomes deficient, so how can the stomach be harmed? Enriching the north causes the heart fire to descend and the west to remain unexhausted, so how can there be heat in the lungs? This statement is indeed correct. If the stomach is deficient and appetite decreases, it should be treated with aromatic and warm medications. If one is overly concerned with the idea of draining the south, the stomach will worsen. If one can apply treatment based on this principle, half the battle against atrophy will have been won. As for the seven emotions and six excesses, which have many variations, formulating prescriptions based on specific illnesses cannot be fully expressed through words.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weakness</strong>: Refers to limbs that are soft and powerless, with joints relaxed and not contracting. The sage deems weakness to be crucial among various ailments, thus dedicating a section to it. It divides the heat of the five organs into named diseases, their corresponding skin, vessels, tendons, muscles, and bones leading to the feet being unable to support weight. It narrates the evils of heat affecting the five organs, indicating that each organ is harmed by a specific evil. The subtle meaning here is that through the five emotions, five labors, and six excesses, one may affirm the desires of the organ qi, each providing an example. If one comprehends the eighty-one sections, one can see that the five labors, five emotions, and six excesses indeed produce the heat of the five organs resulting in weakness.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is it that causes this? It is said that when lung qi is hot, the skin becomes withered, resulting from loss and unfulfilled desires; similar to another text which states that one who is initially rich may later become poor. Although it may not harm the external influences, the skin burns and tendons contract, leading to weakness and paralysis. This is linked to the seven emotions being suppressed. If we discuss conditions like atrophy, shortness of breath, nausea, or feelings of anger and depression, all belong to the aforementioned. Therefore, how can we say that any heat does not cause atrophy, or that any pulse is unaffected by heat? For instance, if heart qi is hot, it leads to pulse atrophy, as this arises from excessive sorrow, where yang energy moves inward, causing blood to collapse and the pulse to become vacuous, leading to pulse atrophy. This regards the heart as the governing organ of spirit, essential to the pulse. Furthermore, each of the five organs has its spirit and aspirations. When anger arises, it causes qi to ascend abnormally, and in severe cases, it may lead to vomiting blood—manifestations of the five emotions. Heat injuring blood causes blood to reverse in the meridians, leading to emptiness, as if joy in form meets sorrow in aspiration. When ailments arise in the pulse, all five emotions contribute to its atrophy, not solely sorrow. Additionally, the five emotions affecting each organ causes damage to their associated spirits. Severe anger can force tendons to stretch, while joy manifests in bodily illness, resulting in joy in spirit and suffering in form, whereas joy in form and sorrow in aspiration leads to illness in the tendons.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is troubled by anxiety, fear, joy, or anger, then due to the vast void, the five organs affect each other, leading to illnesses manifesting in twenty-five variations. This results in conditions such as the decay of the large bones and the sinking of the flesh. The spirit and will within the five organs can be considered as heat illnesses, which cannot be enumerated. For instance, if the liver&#39;s energy is heated due to endless thoughts, and desires remain unfulfilled, it is akin to the lungs&#39; unfulfilled longing. Excessive indulgence in sexual relations causes relaxation of the fundamental tendons, similar to the exhaustion resulting from long travels of the kidneys. From this, it is evident that the five kinds of labor can each cause harm to the corresponding skin, flesh, tendons, and bones of the five organs. For example, if the spleen&#39;s energy is heated, it is influenced gradually by dampness, which is related to matters involving water. If, in a given year, the Yin earth is damp, with the heavens controlling moisture from springs, this leads to muscle atrophy and the feet becoming weak and unable to recover. This serves as an example of how external factors arise from the five organs. The same applies to all other organs.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The return of lesser yin leads to muscle atrophy; the return of lesser yang leads to pulse atrophy; the governance of yangming over heaven’s affairs results in bone atrophy influenced by the four energies. The governance of jueyin confirms that wind energy descends, and spleen energy ascends, resulting in atrophy of the muscles. There are conditions due to dampness, initially felt as wrapping; if damp heat persists and is not dispelled, the large muscles become soft and short, while the small muscles are loose and elongated, where softness and shortness denote rigidity, and looseness and elongation denote atrophy. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; discusses the eight transformations of wind, which can injure muscles, flesh, or bones, with excess heat causing the muscles to loosen, bones to wither, and flesh to decay. Thus, it is common for external excess to give rise to diseases of the five viscera. </p>
<p>However, some do not mention the external pathogens, but instead discuss the conditions arising from internal deficiencies of organs. For example, a spleen ailment denotes a heavy body and muscle atrophy, with foot atrophy resulting in difficulty walking; kidney deficiency can lead to lameness or paralysis; a surplus of the three yangs with insufficient three yins leads to unevenness; if the small yang of the foot is deficient, it results in atrophy of the legs, preventing one from rising from a seated position; if the small yang of the foot is deficient, one may experience failure to retract the feet and thin shins. Furthermore, injuries from diet occur; an overly salty flavor can fatigue the bone energy, and an overly spicy flavor can weaken the tendons and meridians, particularly among those indulging in rich foods, leading to uneven atrophy and fatigue.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What has been presented above pertains solely to the condition of weakness due to insufficient use of the original principles. As for the case when all five organs are intensely heated, causing the spirit to become dim and collapse, and both hands and feet to lose function—what is commonly referred to as paralysis—surely this too is a severe form of weakness. Furthermore, in the subsequent discussion of lung weakness as an organ disease, there are also cases where heart qi weakness results in death, indicating that all five organs can indeed be afflicted by weakness; this can be understood. The &quot;Original Disease Theory&quot; discusses the involuntary loss of urine, stating that lung heat afflicts the kidney area, impeding the circulation in the foot&#39;s Shao Yin channel, so that qi and blood cannot flow freely, leading to weakness and paralysis. This causes the spirit to be ineffective and unable to perform its functions, resulting in the involuntary loss of urine and feces. Therefore, from this discussion, it is evident that whenever the spirit, qi, or blood is either weak or obstructed, any of the organs, channels, or related areas—internally or externally—may become dysfunctional. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; emphasizes this matter, repeatedly addressing it in various chapters, yet later readers have completely missed its essence.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The gathering of discussions on theories often sees either the concept of &quot;excessive labor&quot; or the &quot;Wind Gate.&quot; It was Danxi who first elucidated errors that had persisted for over a thousand years, and yet his explanations remain unclear; this is regrettable. It is stated: &quot;The discussion of atrophy involves the Yangming channel, aligning with the ancestral sinews at the Qi Street. Due to Yangming deficiency, the ancestral sinews become lax, and the belt channel fails to pull, resulting in foot atrophy, hence the sole focus on Yangming.&quot; Now, how shall you treat the various conditions of illness and atrophy that you have examined? It is said: &quot;The sage speaks of one principle, which can be extrapolated to ten or a hundred; is it solely about foot atrophy? The principle of complementing each channel and assisting its roots, understanding their deficiencies and strengths, harmonizing the counterflow and proper flow, contains all treatment methods for dispelling pathogens.&quot; The mention of regulating the channels, muscles, and flesh, according to their seasonal afflictions, also pertains to the treatment methods for the various conditions of atrophy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can this be explained? According to the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it is said that the true qi is received from Heaven and combines with the food qi to fill the body. It is also stated that food first enters the stomach&#39;s two regions to nourish the five organs and separately branches out into the two pathways of nourishment and defense. The great qi that stagnates and does not flow accumulates in the chest, known as the sea of qi. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the foot Taiyin is the three Yin; its channels traverse the stomach and belong to the spleen, thus Taiyin circulates qi within the three Yin. The Yangming represents the exterior and serves as the sea of the five organs and six bowels, circulating qi in the three Yang. Each organ receives qi from Yangming via its respective channels, hence the stomach facilitates the movement of its fluids. When the limbs are unable to absorb the qi of food and water, they gradually weaken day by day, leading to blockages in the Yin pathways; the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the qi to thrive, thus they do not function properly. The Chong vessel originates below the kidneys and connects with the Ren vessel that arises from the womb, governing the blood sea; it is also referred to as the sea of the five organs and six bowels, all of which derive nourishment from it.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The upper channels absorb the three Yang and nourish all essence, while the lower channels absorb the three Yin and nourish all sinews, warming the muscles. They connect with the Yongming channel at the Qi Chong point. Hence, when Yongming is deficient, the channel is loose, and the Dai Mai is unresponsive, resulting in foot weakness and inability to move. Observing this, we see that true Qi is the way of heaven, while grain Qi is the way of earth. Without heaven, earth cannot generate; without earth, heaven cannot be realized. Therefore, true Qi and grain Qi must come together to create life, establishing the pathway for physical Qi. Thus, when Yongming is deficient and the five organs receive nothing, they cannot circulate the blood and Qi, nourish Yin and Yang, moisten the sinews and bones, or facilitate joints. If the Qi Sea receives nothing, then the Wei Qi cannot warm and nourish the flesh, fill the skin, or support the opening and closing of the pores. If the Blood Sea receives nothing, then the channels outside and inside are empty; consequently, the spirit, Qi, and blood that sustain life become weak. Therefore, in the entire body, wherever it cannot receive the water and grain Qi, it becomes nonfunctional and results in atrophy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of atrophy, as detailed in the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; indicates that the symptoms associated with the five organs are all related to heat. These symptoms arise from the heat of the lungs, leading to dryness in the metal element and depletion of the water element, thus resulting in atrophy. The treatment theories of Danxi indeed align with this. However, upon closer examination of the texts, it is stated that excessive sorrow can obstruct the collaterals, leading to pulse atrophy. Endless thoughts and unmet desires can cause muscle atrophy, while dampness can cause water-related issues, leading to atrophy of flesh; therefore, they are not entirely due to heat. This suggests a complexity—there are those who generate heat from such conditions, but there are also those whose vital energy is harmed. When vital energy is damaged, it can result in insufficient essence to nourish, and insufficient blood to sustain; this is quite common as well.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one were to generally discuss fire, there would be a concern that genuine yang might be depleted, and that soil might weaken and water dry up, which some could not endure. Therefore, one should consider the shallow and deep aspects of cold and heat, carefully examine the voids and fullness, as well as the urgency of conditions in order to administer treatment, so that a complete cure for atrophy might be achieved.</p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;If dampness and heat are not eliminated, the large tendons become soft and short, while the small tendons become slack and long; softness and shortness lead to rigidity, while slackness and length lead to atrophy.&quot; This pronouncement from the Inner Canon on tendon diseases is merely an illustrative remark meant to inspire self-reflection. It does not imply that the large tendons must be without slackness or that the small tendons must be free from softness and shortness. For instance, atrophy and weakness surely derive from slackness and length; could the large tendons truly be unaffected? The meaning conveyed in this classic can be understood from this perspective. Thus, beyond the condition of atrophy, whenever encountering diseases like spasm, one must recognize that rigidity arises from softness and shortness, while paralysis and weakness result from slackness and length. This captures the essence of the Inner Canon, and one can also obtain the rationale for distinguishing between cold, heat, dryness, and dampness.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Generally, weakness caused by damp heat presents with a rapid and slippery pulse and many signs of restlessness and heat, so one must first eliminate the heat. The Er Miao San (Two Wonderful Powder) is appropriate, adjusting according to the symptoms. If there is both yin deficiency and heat, one should use a modified version of the Si Wu Tang (Four Substance Decoction), Hu Jing Gu Wan (Tiger Bone Pill), or similar formulas like Dan Xi Bu Yin Wan (Dan Xi&#39;s Yin Supplement Pill) and Zi Yin Ba Wei Wan (Eight Flavor Nourishing Pills). If there is absolutely no heat present and the condition arises solely from kidney water deficiency and liver blood deficiency, one should avoid using cooling medicines that could weaken the vital energy. The best option is Lu Jiao Jiao Wan (Deer Horn Gel Pill) or formulas like Jia Wei Si Jin Wan (Modified Four Jin Pills), Ba Wei Di Huang Wan (Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill), and Jin Gang Wan (Diamond Pill), which can all be selected as needed. If there is yin deficiency without dampness or with excessive sweating, using Cang Zhu (Atractylodes) lightly is discouraged, as weakness is especially intolerant of exterior dispersing treatments and could further harm the yin. Dong Yuan considers Huang Bo (Phellodendron) as the primary medicine, supplemented by Huang Qi (Astragalus) and other tonics to treat various weakness conditions, without a fixed method. There can be cases with phlegm accumulation, excessive dampness and heat, a mix of damp and heat, or accompanying qi issues, in which case one should create a treatment plan according to the specific illness; this is also an excellent method for treating weakness.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Zuan Yao&quot; states: For damp-heat, the Jianbu pill should be supplemented with remedies that dry dampness and reduce fire, such as Huangbo, Huangkui, and Cangzhu. For damp-phlegm, add Cangzhu, Baizhu, Huangkui, and Huangbo to the Erchen Decoction, along with bamboo juice and ginger juice. For blood deficiency, add Cangzhu and Huangbo to the Four Herbal Compounds, and take the Xiangbui pill. For qi deficiency, add Cangzhu, Huangkui, and Huangbo to the Four Noble Herbs. Huangbo and Cangzhu are essential medicines for treating atrophy. Although the above prescriptions target different conditions, they all aim to reduce fire and clear dampness, which is the fundamental principle of treatment that remains consistent.</p>
<p>Chen Wuze remarked: The human body is formed of skin, blood vessels, sinews, muscles, and bone marrow, with internal organs such as the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys presiding over them. Yet, if one indulges in emotions, fatigue, or idleness, it can lead to the depletion of internal essence and blood, resulting in weak and feeble blood vessels and muscles, thus causing atrophy that resembles symptoms of soft wind syndrome. Soft wind syndrome occurs due to external factors like wind and cold, where the righteous qi clashes with the evil qi, causing swelling and pain, indicating a real pathogen. The atrophy arises from insufficient internal organs; however, if one does not overexert themselves, there will be no pain, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment for Weakness</strong></p>
<p>When a person suffers from complete depletion of vital energy and blood, resulting in multiple ailments throughout the body, they may experience continuous headaches accompanied by bone pain or abdominal pain along with pain in all four limbs. These symptoms, often indicative of weakness, should primarily be treated by addressing the Yangming stomach fire. However, if the stomach fire is overly vigorous and the body, including the limbs, becomes emaciated, one cannot solely target the stomach meridian. </p>
<p>The formula consists of three qian each of ginseng, astragalus, white peony root, poria, white mustard seed, and angelica, five qian each of job&#39;s tears and plantago seeds, one qian of chrysanthemum flowers, one liang each of ophiopogon and cooked rehmannia, and five fen each of dried tangerine peel and fermented wheat. Boil these in three large bowls of water until it reduces to one bowl, and take this as a dose. </p>
<p>While one might ordinarily use bamboo leaf and gypsum decoction when Yangming fire is excessive, the choice to utilize ginseng, poria, astragalus, and cooked herbs as the primary ingredients is made to replenish vital energy and blood. The stomach fire is so strong that it has already scorched the vital energy and blood; further use of the Baihu decoction would temporarily relieve the fire toxicity, but it would inevitably lead to a severe depletion of bodily fluids. Thus, it is preferable to use a large dose of tonifying herbs for energy and blood, as adequate hydration will naturally quell the fire.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the middle of the formula, one should appropriately use ingredients such as Yuan Shen, Mai Dong, and Gan Ju, which are purely meant to quell the spreading fire of the Yang Ming. Moreover, with the addition of Dang Gui and similar herbs to nourish blood and support the source, this is quite effective. However, if the dosage of these herbs is small, it not only fails to benefit but may actually exacerbate the fire’s intensity; this is the brilliance of this major treatment method. Generally, the major treatment method should be applied at the onset of deficiency conditions with excess stomach fire; using large doses can turn defeat into victory. If one hesitates and is cautious initially, fearing to use large doses, and waits until the stomach qi has weakened before realizing the need for large doses, it will be too late.</p>
<p>For cases of weakness where the individual cannot get out of bed year-round, has a glowing complexion, weak and powerless feet, and cannot take a step, this indicates an excess of Yang Ming fire. It is unnecessary to treat the legs directly; instead, calming the stomach fire will naturally strengthen the legs. If one does not calm the stomach fire and only uses nourishing yin herbs, an increase in food intake will further weaken the legs. The method should include three taels of Yuan Shen, one tael each of Mai Dong and Shu Di, three qian of Gan Ju Hua, and one qian each of Ren Shen and Tu Si Zi, boiled with several bowls of water to yield four bowls of decoction. Allowing for unrestricted consumption will gradually calm the stomach fire, and the legs will naturally regain strength. Thus, this approach treats the legs indirectly. </p>
<p>It is essential to discern that not all weakness is due to Yang Ming deficiency; this distinction must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This condition cannot result in the patient getting out of bed, yet they can eat well. The patient feels weak and cannot stand. People think this is due to deficiency, but it is not. This is due to extreme cold in the kidneys leading to a boiling fire; it appears as deficiency yet is not. At the onset, it was indeed due to the blazing fire of the yangming, and if cooled down, the stomach fire would diminish, while the kidney water would dry up, leading to nighttime coughing and phlegm. During the day, the patient feels somewhat better, groaning on the bed, eating little and slowly, and feeling increasingly uncomfortable. </p>
<p>The prescription should be one tael of Yuan Shen, three taels of Mai Dong, and two taels of cooked dihuang, prepared with water. If there is liver fire, add five qian of Bai Shao and prepare with water. Four doses may allow the patient to get out of bed. Subsequently, a large dose of Six Flavor Decoction should be prepared, adding one tael each of Mai Dong and cooked dihuang, one qian of Wu Wei, four qian of Shan Zhu Yu, three qian each of Shan Yao and Dan Pi, and two qian each of Ze Xie and Fu Ling, brewed with water. </p>
<p>The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of Yuan Shen and Mai Dong to nourish the lung metal and eliminate the wandering fire in the heart; it also excels in using cooked dihuang to replenish kidney water, which ensures there is enough water and strengthens the stomach fire. When the lung metal naturally nourishes kidney water, the kidney water will be stored in the kidney palace and will not surge upward, thus resolving the cough without needing to suppress it.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The weakness of the legs, unable to walk, is thought to be due to a deficiency of kidney essence, but that is not the case. The issue is that the qi is insufficient to function properly. The prescription is to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding three liang each of ginseng and ox knee, five liang of golden needle stone, and one liang of astragalus. After two doses, strength will return to the legs; after four doses, one should be able to walk. Ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes are all supreme tonics for qi, while ox knee and golden needle stone are divine remedies for strengthening the legs, making this combination effective.</p>
<p>As for those with atrophy, they must lie in bed for a long time and cannot suddenly rise; what is the reason? All the symptoms of atrophy belong to the yangming stomach fire. When this fire exhausts the kidney essence, the bones become empty and without nourishment, making standing impossible. However, if only treating the yangming, when will the marrow in the bones be replenished? It is difficult to regain strength in both legs. The method is to use one liang each of yuanshen and ophiopogon, two liang of rehmannia, and two qian of ox knee, decocting and taking it. The brilliance of this formula lies in not treating the yangming, but directly addressing the kidney channel to replenish its deficiency. When kidney essence is restored, the stomach fire will naturally subside. Moreover, the ophiopogon clears lung qi, and the ox knee strengthens the knees and shins; thus, using this prescription long-term can prevent the symptoms of atrophy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

Then, what will replenish the bone marrow? It&#39;s no wonder that after years of treatment, one becomes increasingly fatigued. The symptoms of weakness and atrophy are due to the excess fire of the Yangming. If the kidney&#39;s water is insufficient to nourish, then the bones become hollow and cannot support the body. </p>
<p>The prescription should include three taels of rehmannia, three taels of shan zhu yu, two taels of mai dong, boiled in water and taken. The essence of this formula lies in the fact that rehmannia and shan zhu yu together enrich the water, while rehmannia removes the floating fire, and mai dong nourishes the lung&#39;s Yin, allowing Yin to flourish and Yang to diminish, naturally extinguishing the fire’s flame. Once the flame is extinguished, the metal and water will regenerate, there will be fluids in the organs, and the bone marrow will be replenished. Can the legs still be incapable of walking?</p>
<p>Regarding the prescription for weakness, use three taels of coix, three taels of rehmannia, one tael of mai dong, one qian of north wuwu herb, and five qian of niu xi, boiled in water and taken.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When atrophy (weizheng) persists without improvement, it is because the fire of the Yangming has completely consumed the water of the kidneys. However, how can one avoid death and continue to exist? Although the kidney water is dried up, the metal of the lungs still obtains the vital energy from the stomach to nourish it. When the lung metal has energy, it must flow down to generate kidney water. Despite the kidneys being shriveled, there will always be some moisture at night, and the kidney channel continually has vitality; hence, one survives and does not die.</p>
<p>The prescription is to use half a pound of ophiopogon, one pound of cooked rehmannia, seven taels of rhemannia root, and one tael of schisandra, boiled in twenty bowls of water until six bowls remain. Take three bowls in the morning, two in the afternoon, and one at midnight for two consecutive days; one will surely be able to sit up. </p>
<p>Then, change the prescription to eight taels of cooked rehmannia, three taels of rhemannia root, four taels of ophiopogon, three qian of north schisandra, four qian of cornelian cherry, and one tael of cattle’s knee; boil in ten bowls of water until two bowls remain, taking one bowl in the morning and one in the evening. After ten days, one will be able to walk, and after a month, one will return to normal.</p>
<p>By greatly nourishing the water of the lungs and kidneys, the fire of the Yangming will cease to consume itself. The reason for atrophy lasting without death is that it stems from the moisture provided by the lungs, supported by the roots of the kidneys. If the kidney water had no roots, where would the night moisture needed for the lung metal arise from? I would simply see it as a withering. It is precisely because there are roots that one does not die.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, using large doses of kidney tonics, one can recover from illness, as they have a foundation that can be salvaged. The treatment for atrophy also varies. The formula consists of one tael each of Yuanshen (Radix Ginseng) and Shanzhuyu (Cornus Fruit), three taels each of Shudi (Rehmanniae Radix) and Shashen (Adenophora Root), four taels of Maidong (Ophiopogon), five qian of Wuweizi (Schisandra Fruit), decoct in water for ingestion. In ten days, one can be up and about; I have personally tested this, and it is remarkably effective. </p>
<p>For those with atrophy who cannot get out of bed and have become useless, the internal fire is intensely burning, having dried up the kidney water. If one does not replenish the kidneys and only aims to reduce the fire, there will be no hope of rejuvenation. Although treating atrophy often focuses on the Yangming (the stomach&#39;s fire), the stomach fire must certainly be reduced, while the kidney water must also be replenished. </p>
<p>I now share an extraordinary formula that replenishes water amidst fire, reduces fire within water, harmonizes the stomach and kidneys, thus treating both conditions simultaneously. Naturally, bone marrow will increase, and burning heat will disperse; the atrophy will self-cure without direct treatment. This formula is named &quot;Jiang Bu Dan&quot; (Reinforcing and Reducing Pill): It consists of three qian of Ren Shen (Ginseng), one tael each of Shudi, Yuanshen, and Maidong, five qian each of Ganju Hua (Chrysanthemum), Shengdi (Raw Rehmannia), Shashen, and Digupi (Lycium Bark), and two qian of Cheqianzi (Plantago Seed); decoct in water for ingestion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the fire of the stomach does not arise, it will not consume the yin in the kidneys; when the water of the kidneys is sufficient, it can control the heat in the stomach. The two interact and support each other, creating a remedy for atrophy—who can surpass this? When a person has weak legs and cannot stand, yet their appetite remains strong, if they resist hunger even slightly, their head and face will feel hot, and they may have persistent coughing—this is also a sign of atrophy, as the heat of the stomach fire rushes upwards to the lung metal. The lung metal is pressured by fire, unable to transmit the clear and purifying energy to the lower abdomen, causing kidney water to dry up, the marrow in the bones to diminish, thus they cannot stand. Meanwhile, the fire of the stomach burns on, allowing them to eat well yet still hunger; over time, the water will dry up and the marrow will be depleted, leading to death—must we not urgently drain the fire from the stomach? However, if we drain the fire without supplementing the water, the stomach fire will have nothing to restrain it, making it hard to cease. The formula for awakening atrophy is as follows: [ingredients] cooked rehmannia, yam, and original root, each one tael; ginseng, Angelica sinensis, and white peony root, each five qian; white mustard seed three qian, fermented wheat two qian; decoct and consume. After one dose, the fire decreases; after two doses, the fire retreats; after ten doses, there will be signs of recovery from atrophy, and thirty doses may achieve complete healing. This formula is remarkable as the sweet chrysanthemum flower serves as the monarch, draining the fire of the yangming without harming the qi of the stomach; the rest merely supplements kidney water to generate liver blood, strengthens the spleen qi, and alleviates phlegm. In essence, treating atrophy focuses on the yangming; draining yangming first, then assisting with other herbs, makes success easier.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p>Grind the above into a fine powder, then mix with honey to form pills the size of a wutong seed. Each dose consists of thirty pills, increasing to forty or fifty pills as necessary. Take it with warm wine on an empty stomach, twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>Qiwai Dan</strong> works on the Yangming, which governs the stomach and is considered the sea of the five organs and six bowels. It nourishes the tendons and strengthens the bones while facilitating movement. The Chong vessel is the sea of all meridians; it helps in the distribution of qi and fluids, nourishing the tendons in conjunction with Yangming. If the Yangming is deficient, the tendons will weaken, and the Dai vessel will not function, leading to atrophy of the legs. Treatment involves replenishing the essence and clearing the pathways, adjusting the balance of deficiency and excess, harmonizing the flow in the sinews, bones, and flesh, so that each aspect receives the right timing, and the illness is resolved. When the Kidney meridian is deficient, it leads to bone atrophy, making it difficult to lift the waist and legs, causing increasing fatigue.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states: In spring, target the collaterals and major tendons between the flesh; in severe cases, go deep, in moderate cases, go shallow. In summer, target the skin, muscle, and collaterals on the surface. In autumn, target the joints, following the methods of spring. In winter, target the wells and collaterals, thus going deep and holding. This is the order of the four seasons, where qi resides, illnesses converge, and organs are suitably treated. For cramping, treat while standing; it can help restore function. For weakness, target while stretching; it can help with recovery. The Taiyang channel originates at Zhi Yin and connects at the Ming Men. The Ming Men is the eye. The Yangming channel originates at Li Dui and connects at the forehead. The forehead refers to the area near the ears. The Shaoyang channel originates at Qiao Yin and connects at the ear drum. Taiyang is for opening, Yangming is for closing, and Shaoyang is the pivot. Therefore, when open or twisted, it leads to muscle spasms and sudden illnesses. For acute diseases, target Taiyang, checking for excess or deficiency. An obstruction is when the skin feels burnt and weak. When closed or twisted, qi cannot settle, leading to atrophy. For atrophy, target Yangming, checking for excess or deficiency. When there is no settling, true qi is stagnant, and evil qi resides. If the pivot twists, the bones dislocate and cannot stabilize; thus, target Shaoyang, checking for excess or deficiency. Bone dislocation refers to loose joints that do not contract.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The so-called &quot;bone channel&quot; refers to the origin of movement; it is important to investigate its root. The lesser yang of the foot is named &quot;brightness,&quot; located five inches above the ankle, separated from the &quot;jueyin,&quot; connecting to the metatarsal. In reality, it is related to &quot;jue&quot; (numbness), while if it is empty, it leads to weakness and paralysis, making it impossible to rise from a seated position; this is its distinct feature.</p>
<p>Weakness and numbness are like a constriction of the extremities, and the disease can be resolved with treatment twice a day. For those lacking sensation, it can be known in ten days; without interruption, the illness will cease. In febrile diseases, with a pale face and head pain, and restlessness in the limbs, treatment should be taken between the tendons, using the fourth needle in the four extremes. </p>
<p>For limb paralysis, when the eyes are congested, the connection should be sought at the liver, but gold cannot be extracted there; gold represents the lung. These twelve evils are all the strange evils that invade the empty orifices. Thus, where the evil resides, there is deficiency. If the upper qi is insufficient, the brain feels unfulfilled, the ears suffer from ringing, the head feels heavy, and the eyes become dizzy. If the middle qi is deficient, urination and defecation become disrupted, and the intestines suffer from noises. If the lower qi is lacking, it leads to weakness and heart distress; it is necessary to replenish the area below the outer ankle.</p>
<p>For weakness and heart distress, the needle should be inserted two inches above the big toe; another method is to replenish the area below the outer ankle. The &quot;Classic of Changes&quot; states: if the foot is weak and unresponsive, one cannot walk, cannot speak, and the hands and feet are paralyzed and unable to move; this falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;earth granary.&quot; </p>

<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Nourishing Life&quot; states: What the world suffers from are the afflictions of the four elements, manifesting as paralysis and illness. It is said that they are akin to guests of Yama. Why is this so? Because the afflictions reach an extreme, and no medical remedies can save them. These ailments arise from the six desires and seven emotions, influenced by the sun and moon, resulting in a depletion of the original essence and a deficiency of vital energy. When the physician employs only herbs from earth, stone, grass, and wood, how can they possibly replenish the primordial life? Thus, in the first volume of the &quot;Suwen,&quot; it is discussed that tranquility and non-action, along with a gathered spirit and interior preservation, are to cultivate true energy through stillness. Furthermore, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions acupuncture and moxibustion as methods to regulate energy, capable of addressing stubborn ailments, where the eight methods of movement can abruptly awaken deep-seated illnesses. This can be seen in the ancient medical texts, which emphasize addressing the root of the ailment through the regulation of energy, achieving evident effects.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Acupuncture has the effectiveness of tonification and purgation. The method of respiration related to the source gates allows for the circulation of energy. The principles of the bear and the bird can target both exterior and interior issues. Utilizing both methods instead of needles ultimately relates to the body and harmonizes with the universe, achieving a unified qi. If one can skillfully practice this, then even serious conditions may be treated without medication, which is to treat a person&#39;s body with the way of that person.</p>
<p>The method of guiding and pulling, initially aimed to focus solely on seated exercises, has removed the guiding instruction. However, novice practitioners or those unable to perform these techniques can still learn and achieve healing without medicine during illness. </p>
<p>For instance, if there is an affliction in the right hand, point the right fingers toward the right side, turning the head and looking to the left. The same applies for issues on the left. Perform the respiratory technique twenty-four times. If the left foot is affected, sit on a flat bench, place the left foot on the right knee, hold the heel with the left hand, and pull the toes with the right hand while turning the head to the left. The same applies to the right. Using force to pull can eliminate ailments caused by wind, cold, heat, and dampness and can address both recent and longstanding paralysis—this is invariably effective.</p>
<p>In close practices, three lifts and three swallows, returning thoughts to the source, accumulating qi in a cycle, if the left side&#39;s energy is obstructed, focus the practice on the left hand; the same applies to the right side. Each side must circulate qi with diligent effort for a hundred days to fully open the meridians.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

Her limbs were weak and withered, unable to feed herself, and her eyes were wide open. Many doctors could not cure her, so they called for Ge Kejiu. He looked at her and smiled, saying, &quot;This is not difficult to treat.&quot; He ordered everything fragrant in her room and the tassels to be removed, made a mound by digging the earth on the floor, carried the girl onto it, locked the door, and instructed her family to observe for movement in her hands and feet and to report to him. After a while, her hands and feet indeed moved, and she cried out. He threw a medicine ball, and the next day she was able to walk out from the mound. It was because this girl had a strong desire for fragrance, which had eroded her spleen due to its vapors.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ru Men Shi Qin&quot; states: Three soldiers in Wanqiu were all suffering from atrophy and had not healed for many years. They had swelling and pain below the waist, sores all over their bodies, dim vision, dry lips, and a thirsty tongue, and they sought treatment from a doctor named Dai. Dai wanted to prescribe a purgative, but the two did not comply, as they were misled by other doctors on warm and tonifying medicine, and both died. A fellow patient, Song Ziyu, soon realized, &quot;They have already died from heat; I must change the treatment.&quot; He respectfully invited Dai. Dai said, &quot;Your illness has been treated with warm medicine for a long time; we must first get rid of that harmful medicine before addressing the root of the illness. I can prescribe a purgative of three hundred measures.&quot; Ziyu said, &quot;I respectfully follow your guidance.&quot; First, a massive dose of pills and Jun Chuan powder was given for purging, about a basin&#39;s worth, and reduced by a third the next day. His legs, which had previously felt numb, began to feel painful and itchy, and it wasn&#39;t until three hundred measures later that he finally felt at ease. Dai remarked, &quot;For atrophy, we should focus on the Yangming channel, which corresponds to the stomach and large intestine.&quot; This indicates that addressing the illness involves both acupuncture and medicine equally.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

He sought treatment from me. Upon examining his pulse in both hands, it was slippery, large, and strong. I recalled the Inner Canon&#39;s teaching that internal fire can cause imbalances leading to cold conditions. Thus, I used salty water to penetrate his diaphragm and assess the presence of cold and retained phlegm; if there was retained food or drink in the upper abdomen, it could be expelled. Once the retained phlegm was eliminated, we then proceeded to purge. In the fluctuating intervals, he felt increasingly clear-minded, his appetite improved daily, and he gradually regained movement in his legs, with his knees extending as well. His heart energy was descending while his kidney energy was rising. I subsequently prescribed a decoction of Huang Lian to detoxify, adding Dang Gui and other herbs, along with Xie Xin Tang, Liang Ge San, and Chai Hu Yin Zi, preparing strong decoctions for him to sip on regularly.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; says: The gentleman Wu from Dongyang, fifty years old, was stout and indulgent, often anxious and angry. His pulse was always deep and slippery.

By April, his legs weakened, qi surged upward, and his appetite diminished, so he called me for treatment. I said: This is heat stagnation with spleen deficiency; symptoms of atrophy and weakness have developed. Although stout with a deep pulse, it is not a definite sign of death. However, the medication was overly fiery and at this time of excessive heat, survival was indeed difficult. I prescribed two pounds of bamboo juice with Bai Zhu paste, which helped lower qi and improve food intake. A month later, he sweated profusely and died. I write this as a warning for wise individuals, to avoid following the same path.</p>

Later, he carelessly regulated himself and relapsed. He used something similar to Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan, which caused significant phlegm and heat, resembling a stroke. Using medications to dispel wind and transform phlegm resulted in difficult urination and dryness of the mouth and tongue.

Opposing the stored energy of winter harms the kidneys, which results in weakness in spring, thus leading to fewer offspring.

When Yang energy is weak, it fails to nourish the tendons; therefore, major tendons become soft and short, while minor tendons elongate and slacken. The major tendons are connected to the minor tendons within the bones and joints, thus they become soft and short due to stagnant heat; externally, dampness causes them to be slack and long. Shortness results in spasms, while length leads to abandonment. **The Theory of Distinctions between Yin and Yang** When the Three Yang energies are affected, symptoms include chills and fever, abscesses and swellings, as well as paralysis and numbness. **Note**: The Three Yang refers to the Sun Yang. The Sun Yang is the master of all Yang energies and governs the tendons; when the tendons are injured, it results in paralysis, and when the energy is harmed, it leads to numbness. When the Three Yang and Three Yin are ill, it results in partial atrophy and easy paralysis, causing the limbs to be motionless. **Note**: The Three Yang and Three Yin refers to the Sun and the Greater Yin.

Thus, when the lung heat causes dryness, the skin and hair are weakened and thin, which results in atrophy and paralysis. [Note: The ability of the body to move and act comes from the nourishment of the internal organs to the tendons, blood vessels, bones, and muscles. When the internal organs are diseased, the exterior of the body is atrophied. Lung heat leads to dryness and thinness of the skin, and since the skin relies on the lungs for nourishment, when the skin is thin, the essence and fluids cannot circulate, resulting in overheating of the five organs and consequently atrophy and paralysis.] When heart qi is hot, the lower vessels are constricted and the upper vessels are weak. When the upper is weak, there arises atrophy in the vessels, causing joints to be unsteady and the shins to be slack and unable to support the body. [Note: When heart qi is hot, the qi rises and causes the pulse to become constricted in the upper body. The heart governs the vessels, hence the qi of the pulse turns constricted and rises, leading to weakness in the pulses below.

(Note: The gallbladder is attached to the liver, and when liver qi is heated, bile leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth. When bile leaks, the fascia cannot be nourished and dries out, hence the tension and cramps leading to tendon atrophy.) When spleen qi is heated, it leads to a dry stomach and thirst; the muscles become numb, leading to muscle atrophy. (Note: The qi of the spleen and stomach governs the muscles. When the yangming fluids do not produce, and the taiyin qi does not arrive, the muscles become numb and lead to muscle atrophy.) When kidney qi is heated, the lower back and spine cannot rise, the bones become frail, and the marrow diminishes, leading to bone atrophy. (Note: Kidney heat depletes fluids; the lower back is the orifice of the kidneys, therefore the lower back and spine cannot extend, leading to diminished marrow and frail bones resulting in bone atrophy.) The Emperor asked: How does one come to this? Qi Bo said: The lungs are the master of the viscera and cover the heart. When something is lost, and what one seeks cannot be obtained, the lungs become noisy; when they are noisy, the lung heat causes the leaves to wither. Therefore, it is said that the five viscera suffer from lung heat causing withering and paralysis—this is what it means. (Note: When something is lost, and what one seeks cannot be attained, the heart’s spirit becomes unsettled, and the fire qi rises.)"},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"The lungs are the covering of the heart. When metal (the lungs) suffers the fire’s punishment, it leads to wheezing. If the lungs become overheated and dry, there is no way for the fluids to circulate, resulting in heat affecting all five organs. Excessive sorrow can sever the channels, and when they are severed, the yang energy stirs within. This can lead to a collapse beneath the heart, manifesting as blood in the urine. Therefore, this condition is called “the great vessels are empty,” which manifests as muscle atrophy and is transmitted as pulse weakness. Endless thoughts and unfulfilled wishes lead to excessive external desires, causing the tendons to loosen and resulting in muscle atrophy and excessive lust. Thus, it is stated in the lower classic: “Muscle atrophy arises from the liver.” This is related to dampness; if moisture lingers and the environment is damp, the flesh becomes soaked, leading to numbness and resulting in flesh atrophy. Therefore, it is stated in the lower classic: “Flesh atrophy arises from damp conditions.” Long journeys leading to fatigue, encountering great heat and thirst, can internally consume the yang energy. When it is consumed, heat lodges in the kidneys, which are the water organs. If water cannot withstand fire, bones will become withered and marrow will be depleted, leading to an inability of the feet to support the body, resulting in bone atrophy. Therefore, it is stated in the lower classic: “Bone atrophy arises from great heat.” (Note: “Channels” here refers to the Chongmai, or Penetrating Vessel.)"},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"The Chong vessel originates from the center of the womb and is considered the sea of the twelve meridians. The heart governs the blood vessels; therefore, if the collateral of the womb is blocked, the heart qi becomes deficient and moves internally. When the heart qi moves, it leads to a downward flow resulting in frequent urination of blood. If there is a deficiency of blood in the exterior vessels, it leads to muscular paralysis, while a deficiency of blood in the internal vessels results in weakness of the pulse. The blood lost in urination can damage the skin and affect the qi and blood in the meridians. Thus, it is said that the great vessels are empty. Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires can harm liver qi. Those who indulge excessively can experience intense desire leading to spontaneous emission. If there is residual dampness and one resides in a low and moist environment, the combination of internal and external dampness can cause the muscles to become soft and numb, leading to muscular atrophy. Long journeys and exhaustion can harm the kidneys; exposure to extreme heat can damage the yin, and thirst can deplete the yin fluids. Therefore, the yang heat can attack the yin, causing heat to accumulate in the kidneys. Now, with excessive yang and depleted yin, water cannot withstand fire, leading to dryness of the bones and deficiency of the marrow, resulting in inability to support oneself, causing bone atrophy. The emperor asked, \"How can one differentiate these conditions?\" Qi Bo replied: \"Lung heat presents with pale complexion and damaged hair; heart heat shows a red complexion with engorged vessels; liver heat has a greenish hue with brittle nails; spleen heat exhibits a yellow color with twitching flesh; kidney heat appears black with decayed teeth.\""},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"[Note: All atrophy diseases are due to heat in the five organs leading to depletion of essence, unable to nourish the tendons, channels, bones, and flesh; thus, their causes differ and should be diagnosed based on the physical appearance.] The Emperor said: As you say, it is so.

Qibo replied: Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, governing the nourishment of the tendons and the binding of bones, which facilitate movement. The Chong vessel is the sea of channels, governing the seepage into valleys, and it connects with Yangming at the tendons. The meeting of Yin and Yang is at the tendons, gathering at the Qi thoroughfare, and Yangming presides over it; thus, they all belong to the Dai vessel and intertwine with the Governing vessel. Therefore, when Yangming is deficient, the tendons become loose, the Dai vessel does not pull, resulting in the feet being weak and unable to move.

The front Yin is where the tendons gather, combining with Taiyin and Yangming, making it the meeting point of all tendons.

The three Yin and three Yang, twelve primary channels, along with the extraordinary channels Ren, Du, and Chong, flow up and down, all pertained to the constraints of the Dai channel. The Du channel originates at the perineum, bifurcating into Ren and Chong, ascending along the back and abdomen; thus, Ren, Chong, Shaoyin, and Yangming are all interconnected with the Du channel. Yangming is the sea of food and fluids, governing the nourishment of the governing vessel; if deficient, the governing vessel relaxes, unable to bind the bones, leading to dysfunction in the limbs, resulting in atrophy; if the Dai channel fails to extend, the channels below slacken, causing the feet to weaken and become unusable. This explains why atrophy specifically pertains to Yangming. The Emperor asked: How can one differentiate?

The Chong vessel is the sea of the meridians, responsible for moistening and irrigating the valleys. It connects with Yangming at the primary tendons. The convergence of Yin and Yang is in the primary tendons, meeting at the Qi street, with Yangming being the primary force there, all belonging to the belt vessel and linked to the governing vessel.

Yangming is the sea of water and grain, responsible for nourishing the tendons and ligaments. If deficient, the tendons and ligaments loosen, failing to support the bones and facilitating dysfunction, leading to atrophy. If the girdle vessel cannot extend, the tendons in the lower body loosen, causing the feet to weaken and be unusable; thus, these issues of atrophy stem from Yangming.

To elaborate further may seem redundant, but it is not. This is for those in modern times who do not read the Inner Canon and misinterpret its essential meanings. The four conditions of wind, bi, atrophy, and syncope are fundamentally different, yet modern practitioners fail to distinguish them, treating them all as cold due to wind and addressing the deficiency with tonics. This misunderstanding leads to prolonged suffering without resolution. The diseases of the extremities manifest differently: the vigorous ones indicate wind, the numb or painful suggest bi syndrome, weakness and lack of use correspond to atrophy, and the cold or heat that inversely occur indicate syncope. Their root causes are also vastly different. Wind is often a combination of wind and heat; bi syndrome involves wind, dampness, and cold; atrophy arises from fire overcoming metal; and syncope can originate from either cold or heat, both arising from below. Current practitioners overlook these origins and mistakenly assign the label of wind upon seeing hands and feet drooping. Yet, as stated in the Zuo Zhuan, wind can lead to myriad diseases of the extremities. Are we not aware that the six atmospheric factors of heat, dryness, dampness, fire, and cold can all cause these four extremity illnesses?

This is due to the kidney essence (water) being unable to dominate the heart fire. The heart fire rises to disturb the lung metal, which in turn, is restrained by this fire. The six branches (corresponding to the six organs) then become scorched, leading to a weakness of the skin and hair, resulting in the development of wei. \"Zha\" (or “leg weakness”) refers to an inability of the legs to stretch or move properly. The kidney is considered the offspring of the lung's metal. When the kidney water is diminished, it allows the fire to rise uncontrollably. The kidney governs the marrow, and if the fire is excessive, it depletes the marrow, which leads to an internal excess causing this condition. According to the \"Essential Treatise on the True and Great,\" both wei and conditions of breathlessness and vomiting pertain to the upper region (upper jiao). The three jiaos represent the hand's lesser yang and fire. The ailments of wei, breathlessness, and vomiting all exist above the diaphragm and are associated with the lung metal. Thus, muscle weakness leading to pulse weakness is termed \"pulse wei,\" dampness leading to numbness is termed \"flesh wei,\" marrow depletion causing leg weakness is termed \"bone wei,\" and excess in the chamber leads to tendon weakness. Overall, the causes of wei as a disease are due to excess heat affecting the body, indulgence in desires, excessive force, gradually leading to the condition of wei. Therefore, wei in various forms is associated with the lung, pulse wei with the heart, tendon wei with the liver, flesh wei with the spleen, and bone wei with the kidney. The underlying reason is that the lung is affected by heat, causing its leaves to wither, transmitting this heat to the four organs, resulting in the development of the disease. It is clearly stated that wei conditions do not arise from cold. Thus, the occurrence of wei is particularly notable in the months of May, June, and July. \"Wu\" (midday) is designated as the position of the lesser yin fire, \"wei\" (the earth element) is where dampness, metal, and fire intertwine, and \"shen\" (the evening) relates to the lesser yang fire. Hence, wei arises during these three months due to heat. Consequently, those suffering from wei will have a pulse that is superficial and large."},{"anchor":"trans-16p","marker":"16p","type":"translation","text":"Nowadays, those who use medicine often see weakness in the knees and legs, difficulty in walking, or one foot unable to extend, and treat it as cold and damp foot bi-syndrome.

The weakness worsens, and they die—could this be fate? The treatment for weakness and blockage differs greatly. Wind, cold, and damp blockage can still be treated with steaming, boiling, and moxibustion, and may sometimes yield results. However, using such methods for weakness only aggravates the condition—why is that? Weakness stems from heat in the lungs, leading to a 'burnt leaf' condition, which transmits to the five organs; could there be any cold? Treating weakness as a cold condition is akin to killing without a blade. Weakness does not lead to death; deaths arise from erroneous medication. Once, a soldier named Song Ziyu stationed in Xi City, unexpectedly developed weakness during May and June, unable to use his waist and legs, becoming bedridden. He sought my treatment. Examining his hands, both pulses were slippery and rapid yet strong. I relied on the \"Inner Canon\" principles that fire indulgence leads to internal heat while causing coldness around the diaphragm due to phlegm. Recent conditions signify heat, while old ones signify cold. Food and drink that linger in the upper abdomen might also be addressed. After the phlegm was resolved, I administered downward treatments, a few dozen times, and he gradually regained clarity in thought and improved appetite. His legs and feet began to lift, his knees straightened, with the heart descending and the kidneys rising.

If I were to deceive others with this, would it not be akin to incurring divine wrath? This is the evidence of Song Ziyu, thus it must be recorded and shown as a testament for future generations. Therefore, the \"Inner Classic\" states that the method for treating atrophy uniquely utilizes the Yangming channel, which is the stomach vessel, the sea of the five organs and six bowels, responsible for nourishing the foundational tendons. The foundational tendons govern the binding of bones, which are located below the navel and above the pubic hair. Additionally, it governs great bodily movements; these movements are the major joints of the body that regulate bending and stretching.

Flavor refers to the five tastes; when the five tastes are harmonized, they can replenish essence and enhance qi. The five tastes come from five grains, five vegetables, five fruits, and five kinds of meat. The five tastes value harmony and should not overly favor one. Moreover, it is said: tranquility and emptiness lead to the true qi, and the spirit is internally contained; how can illness arise? If one supplements with metals, stones, grasses, and woods, it will surely increase qi over time.

The dry metal succumbs to the damp heat pathogen, severing the source of cold water that supports transformation.

Now if water cannot overcome fire, the bones wither and the marrow becomes deficient, leading to limb weakness and resulting in bone atrophy.” Thus, the \"Lower Classic\" states: “Bone atrophy arises from excessive heat.” This damp heat leads to atrophy, causing weakness and lack of strength in the bones, therefore treatment for atrophy must focus on the Yangming channel. During the long summer, when damp heat prevails and is intensely strong, many people feel their limbs burdened, spirits low, and sluggishness to movement. Symptoms include fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, heaviness and pain in the joints, sometimes with elevated Qi causing wheezing, body heat and restlessness; distension in the heart region, urine that is yellow and scant, loose stools occurring frequently, possibly with diarrhea of yellowish mucus or resembling rice water, with variations in thirst, disinterest in food, sweating, a heavy body, or diminished sweating—often blood diseases appear prior to Qi deficiency."},{"anchor":"trans-20p","marker":"20p","type":"translation","text":"In the pulse, if one feels a strong and slow rhythm, it indicates that dampness is clashing with internal factors, leading to a further delay.

Please clarify for me.\" I answered: \"All forms of atrophy arise from heat in the lungs. Just this one phrase conveys the essence of the treatment method. The classics state: 'The east is real while the west is empty; drain the south and nourish the north.' This indeed refers to the concepts of generation and overcoming, and the grand principles are not beyond this. The east corresponds to wood, which is the liver. The west corresponds to metal, which is the lungs. The south corresponds to fire, which is the heart. The north corresponds to water, which is the kidneys. Among the five directions, only fire has dual aspects. Though the kidneys have two, water resides in one of them. Yang is always in excess, while yin is perpetually insufficient. Hence the texts state, 'One water cannot overcome two fires,' which is a necessary principle. The nature of metal is dry and resides above, governing qi, and it fears fire. The nature of earth is warm and resides in the center, governing the limbs, and it fears wood. The nature of fire is to ascend; if desires become excessive, then water loses its ability to nourish, and fire, in its fear, becomes diminished and falls prey to what overcomes it. When the lungs are afflicted by fire, they become heated. Wood, having a rigid and abrupt nature, when the lungs are overheated, loses its ability to nourish; similarly, when the spleen is afflicted by wood, it suffers damage. If the lungs are hot, they cannot regulate the entire body. If the spleen is damaged, the limbs cannot function, resulting in all forms of atrophy."},{"anchor":"trans-23p","marker":"23p","type":"translation","text":"If the south is purged, then the lung's metal is clear, but the east remains imbalanced; what harm is there to the spleen? If the north is supplemented, then the heart's fire diminishes and the west is not empty; what heat is there in the lungs? Thus, when the Yangming is full, the tendons are nourished, capable of binding the bones and benefiting the mechanisms of the body. The methods for treating atrophy do not exceed this. Luo Longji also said: when wind and fire are intense, one should nourish the kidney water. Dr. Dongyuan takes ephedra as the sovereign, with astragalus and other tonics assisting, to treat various forms of atrophy without a fixed method. There are cases with phlegm accumulation, excess dampness, excess heat, a mixture of dampness and heat, and those with Qi entrapment; when faced with illness, the prescription is made based on the symptoms. Those skilled in treating atrophy can manage it well! Nonetheless, if the principles are misapplied, treatment may fail. Heaven produces Yang, thickening the Qi and generating heat; ancient sages stated that for those suffering from atrophy, if they do not restrain their tastes, I know they will not find peace. When heart heat is severe, the fire uniquely blazes upwards. The kidney's pulse usually descends, but when fire is intense and ascends, the kidney pulse also rises in accordance with the blazing fire. The Yin Qi rebels; fire inside burns higher; the Yin rises separating from the Yang, failing to maintain its position below. The heart's Qi flows through the vessels, thus yielding atrophy, the knees and wrists resembling those that have been broken, unable to assist one another; the meridians and tendons slacken and do not support the body.

This is because of the treatment for stroke mentioned in the \"Jufang,\" where Menglang uses diaphoretic and damp-expelling medicines that harm blood and qi, attacking the root cause, without understanding methods for nourishment. Thus, he references atrophy disease to remedy the shortcomings of the \"Jufang,\" and his words reflect this perspective. However, the symptoms outlined in the \"Jufang\" for stroke—such as uncoordinated limbs, needing assistance to stand, mental confusion, and incoherent speech—are indeed similar to those of heat disease as described in the \"Neijing.\" It is essential to note the differences. The \"Zhenjing\" states that when genuine qi departs and the pathogenic factor remains, it leads to partial atrophy. The discourse on atrophy indicates that when the Yangming is deficient, the muscles relax, the belt vessel fails to draw, leading to atrophy and inability to use the feet. Thus, it is understood that the uncoordinated limbs in the case of atrophy occur due to obstructing evil qi in the channels, whereas in the case of atrophy disease, it is due to a deficiency in Yangming, muscle relaxation, and failing belt vessel. There are symptoms of erratic will in atrophy disease, but none in true atrophy disease itself. The disease of atrophy is also known as wind atrophy, combining internal injury and external invasion, while atrophy disease is solely induced by internal injury. Wind atrophy occurs due to violent impacts, while atrophy disease develops gradually due to laziness. All of this clarifies that atrophy and atrophy disease are distinct ailments.

These herbs disperse wind evils and open the pores. However, improper use may further dry up the yin and blood. Note: According to previous observations, many cases in Jiangnan are attributed to yin deficiency and qi deficiency, with damp heat affecting the fire. Paralysis and weakness often pertain to the yin deficiency and damp heat in the Yangming channels of the hands and feet, so the diagnosis must be made with care. Medical Classics Must Read 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi】 General Discussion It is noted that weakness is a serious illness, hence the \"Inner Classic\" repeatedly discusses it. Earlier scholars varied in their compilations on this topic, sometimes associating it with deficiency and labor, or with wind and dampness, which strays from the core principles. Only Dan Xi particularly emphasized its significance, though his explanations were somewhat lacking. The classic discusses how the root of diseases involves all five organs but especially emphasizes the Taiyin Lung channel. It also states that while treatment methods involve various channels, special emphasis is placed on the Yangming Stomach channel. Why this emphasis? The lung, being of the metal element, is dry in nature and is located above, governing the transformation of qi to circulate throughout the body, being sensitive to fire. When the heat and fire of the five organs vaporize, the metal element is weakened, leading to lung heat and damage. Thus, the diseases vary among the five organs but the place of the hand Taiyin is commonly affected. The spleen, being of the earth element, is damp and located centrally, receiving grains and water to nourish the limbs, also being sensitive to the wood element."},{"anchor":"trans-26p","marker":"26p","type":"translation","text":"When the lung meridian is invaded and loses its proper state, the wood is not restrained and insults what it conquers. Therefore, the treatment principles are categorized by the five organs, and no part of the foot yangming is overlooked. Since it is said that the lung is harmed, treatment should focus on the lung. But why does Qibo exclusively select yangming? According to the \"Ling Shu,\" the true qi received from heaven combines with the grain qi to fill the body. If yangming is deficient, the five organs cannot receive their nourishment and cannot circulate blood and qi, nourish the sinews and bones, or benefit the joints. Therefore, when the body is unable to receive food and water, it results in atrophy; it is not merely about selecting yangming. This is why Dancai says: draining the south clears the lung metal, and the east becomes deficient, so how can the stomach be harmed? Enriching the north causes the heart fire to descend and the west to remain unexhausted, so how can there be heat in the lungs? This statement is indeed correct. If the stomach is deficient and appetite decreases, it should be treated with aromatic and warm medications. If one is overly concerned with the idea of draining the south, the stomach will worsen. If one can apply treatment based on this principle, half the battle against atrophy will have been won.

The subtle meaning here is that through the five emotions, five labors, and six excesses, one may affirm the desires of the organ qi, each providing an example.

It is said that when lung qi is hot, the skin becomes withered, resulting from loss and unfulfilled desires; similar to another text which states that one who is initially rich may later become poor. Although it may not harm the external influences, the skin burns and tendons contract, leading to weakness and paralysis. This is linked to the seven emotions being suppressed. If we discuss conditions like atrophy, shortness of breath, nausea, or feelings of anger and depression, all belong to the aforementioned. Therefore, how can we say that any heat does not cause atrophy, or that any pulse is unaffected by heat? For instance, if heart qi is hot, it leads to pulse atrophy, as this arises from excessive sorrow, where yang energy moves inward, causing blood to collapse and the pulse to become vacuous, leading to pulse atrophy. This regards the heart as the governing organ of spirit, essential to the pulse. Furthermore, each of the five organs has its spirit and aspirations. When anger arises, it causes qi to ascend abnormally, and in severe cases, it may lead to vomiting blood—manifestations of the five emotions. Heat injuring blood causes blood to reverse in the meridians, leading to emptiness, as if joy in form meets sorrow in aspiration. When ailments arise in the pulse, all five emotions contribute to its atrophy, not solely sorrow. Additionally, the five emotions affecting each organ causes damage to their associated spirits. Severe anger can force tendons to stretch, while joy manifests in bodily illness, resulting in joy in spirit and suffering in form, whereas joy in form and sorrow in aspiration leads to illness in the tendons."},{"anchor":"trans-30p","marker":"30p","type":"translation","text":"If one is troubled by anxiety, fear, joy, or anger, then due to the vast void, the five organs affect each other, leading to illnesses manifesting in twenty-five variations.

For instance, if the liver's energy is heated due to endless thoughts, and desires remain unfulfilled, it is akin to the lungs' unfulfilled longing. Excessive indulgence in sexual relations causes relaxation of the fundamental tendons, similar to the exhaustion resulting from long travels of the kidneys. From this, it is evident that the five kinds of labor can each cause harm to the corresponding skin, flesh, tendons, and bones of the five organs. For example, if the spleen's energy is heated, it is influenced gradually by dampness, which is related to matters involving water. If, in a given year, the Yin earth is damp, with the heavens controlling moisture from springs, this leads to muscle atrophy and the feet becoming weak and unable to recover.

There are conditions due to dampness, initially felt as wrapping; if damp heat persists and is not dispelled, the large muscles become soft and short, while the small muscles are loose and elongated, where softness and shortness denote rigidity, and looseness and elongation denote atrophy. The \"Ling Shu\" discusses the eight transformations of wind, which can injure muscles, flesh, or bones, with excess heat causing the muscles to loosen, bones to wither, and flesh to decay. Thus, it is common for external excess to give rise to diseases of the five viscera. However, some do not mention the external pathogens, but instead discuss the conditions arising from internal deficiencies of organs. For example, a spleen ailment denotes a heavy body and muscle atrophy, with foot atrophy resulting in difficulty walking; kidney deficiency can lead to lameness or paralysis; a surplus of the three yangs with insufficient three yins leads to unevenness; if the small yang of the foot is deficient, it results in atrophy of the legs, preventing one from rising from a seated position; if the small yang of the foot is deficient, one may experience failure to retract the feet and thin shins.

The \"Original Disease Theory\" discusses the involuntary loss of urine, stating that lung heat afflicts the kidney area, impeding the circulation in the foot's Shao Yin channel, so that qi and blood cannot flow freely, leading to weakness and paralysis. This causes the spirit to be ineffective and unable to perform its functions, resulting in the involuntary loss of urine and feces.

When the limbs are unable to absorb the qi of food and water, they gradually weaken day by day, leading to blockages in the Yin pathways; the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the qi to thrive, thus they do not function properly. The Chong vessel originates below the kidneys and connects with the Ren vessel that arises from the womb, governing the blood sea; it is also referred to as the sea of the five organs and six bowels, all of which derive nourishment from it."},{"anchor":"trans-35p","marker":"35p","type":"translation","text":"The upper channels absorb the three Yang and nourish all essence, while the lower channels absorb the three Yin and nourish all sinews, warming the muscles. They connect with the Yongming channel at the Qi Chong point. Hence, when Yongming is deficient, the channel is loose, and the Dai Mai is unresponsive, resulting in foot weakness and inability to move. Observing this, we see that true Qi is the way of heaven, while grain Qi is the way of earth. Without heaven, earth cannot generate; without earth, heaven cannot be realized. Therefore, true Qi and grain Qi must come together to create life, establishing the pathway for physical Qi. Thus, when Yongming is deficient and the five organs receive nothing, they cannot circulate the blood and Qi, nourish Yin and Yang, moisten the sinews and bones, or facilitate joints. If the Qi Sea receives nothing, then the Wei Qi cannot warm and nourish the flesh, fill the skin, or support the opening and closing of the pores. If the Blood Sea receives nothing, then the channels outside and inside are empty; consequently, the spirit, Qi, and blood that sustain life become weak. Therefore, in the entire body, wherever it cannot receive the water and grain Qi, it becomes nonfunctional and results in atrophy. To treat atrophy is not merely to address Yongming; what else could be done?"},{"anchor":"trans-36p","marker":"36p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Evidence** The meaning of atrophy, as detailed in the \"Internal Classic,\" indicates that the symptoms associated with the five organs are all related to heat. These symptoms arise from the heat of the lungs, leading to dryness in the metal element and depletion of the water element, thus resulting in atrophy. The treatment theories of Danxi indeed align with this. However, upon closer examination of the texts, it is stated that excessive sorrow can obstruct the collaterals, leading to pulse atrophy. Endless thoughts and unmet desires can cause muscle atrophy, while dampness can cause water-related issues, leading to atrophy of flesh; therefore, they are not entirely due to heat. This suggests a complexity—there are those who generate heat from such conditions, but there are also those whose vital energy is harmed. When vital energy is damaged, it can result in insufficient essence to nourish, and insufficient blood to sustain; this is quite common as well."},{"anchor":"trans-37p","marker":"37p","type":"translation","text":"If one were to generally discuss fire, there would be a concern that genuine yang might be depleted, and that soil might weaken and water dry up, which some could not endure. Therefore, one should consider the shallow and deep aspects of cold and heat, carefully examine the voids and fullness, as well as the urgency of conditions in order to administer treatment, so that a complete cure for atrophy might be achieved. The classics state: \"If dampness and heat are not eliminated, the large tendons become soft and short, while the small tendons become slack and long; softness and shortness lead to rigidity, while slackness and length lead to atrophy.\" This pronouncement from the Inner Canon on tendon diseases is merely an illustrative remark meant to inspire self-reflection. It does not imply that the large tendons must be without slackness or that the small tendons must be free from softness and shortness. For instance, atrophy and weakness surely derive from slackness and length; could the large tendons truly be unaffected? The meaning conveyed in this classic can be understood from this perspective. Thus, beyond the condition of atrophy, whenever encountering diseases like spasm, one must recognize that rigidity arises from softness and shortness, while paralysis and weakness result from slackness and length. This captures the essence of the Inner Canon, and one can also obtain the rationale for distinguishing between cold, heat, dryness, and dampness."},{"anchor":"trans-38p","marker":"38p","type":"translation","text":"**On Treatment** Generally, weakness caused by damp heat presents with a rapid and slippery pulse and many signs of restlessness and heat, so one must first eliminate the heat. The Er Miao San (Two Wonderful Powder) is appropriate, adjusting according to the symptoms. If there is both yin deficiency and heat, one should use a modified version of the Si Wu Tang (Four Substance Decoction), Hu Jing Gu Wan (Tiger Bone Pill), or similar formulas like Dan Xi Bu Yin Wan (Dan Xi's Yin Supplement Pill) and Zi Yin Ba Wei Wan (Eight Flavor Nourishing Pills). If there is absolutely no heat present and the condition arises solely from kidney water deficiency and liver blood deficiency, one should avoid using cooling medicines that could weaken the vital energy. The best option is Lu Jiao Jiao Wan (Deer Horn Gel Pill) or formulas like Jia Wei Si Jin Wan (Modified Four Jin Pills), Ba Wei Di Huang Wan (Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill), and Jin Gang Wan (Diamond Pill), which can all be selected as needed. If there is yin deficiency without dampness or with excessive sweating, using Cang Zhu (Atractylodes) lightly is discouraged, as weakness is especially intolerant of exterior dispersing treatments and could further harm the yin. Dong Yuan considers Huang Bo (Phellodendron) as the primary medicine, supplemented by Huang Qi (Astragalus) and other tonics to treat various weakness conditions, without a fixed method. There can be cases with phlegm accumulation, excessive dampness and heat, a mix of damp and heat, or accompanying qi issues, in which case one should create a treatment plan according to the specific illness; this is also an excellent method for treating weakness."},{"anchor":"trans-39p","marker":"39p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Zuan Yao\" states: For damp-heat, the Jianbu pill should be supplemented with remedies that dry dampness and reduce fire, such as Huangbo, Huangkui, and Cangzhu. For damp-phlegm, add Cangzhu, Baizhu, Huangkui, and Huangbo to the Erchen Decoction, along with bamboo juice and ginger juice. For blood deficiency, add Cangzhu and Huangbo to the Four Herbal Compounds, and take the Xiangbui pill. For qi deficiency, add Cangzhu, Huangkui, and Huangbo to the Four Noble Herbs. Huangbo and Cangzhu are essential medicines for treating atrophy. Although the above prescriptions target different conditions, they all aim to reduce fire and clear dampness, which is the fundamental principle of treatment that remains consistent. Chen Wuze remarked: The human body is formed of skin, blood vessels, sinews, muscles, and bone marrow, with internal organs such as the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys presiding over them. Yet, if one indulges in emotions, fatigue, or idleness, it can lead to the depletion of internal essence and blood, resulting in weak and feeble blood vessels and muscles, thus causing atrophy that resembles symptoms of soft wind syndrome. Soft wind syndrome occurs due to external factors like wind and cold, where the righteous qi clashes with the evil qi, causing swelling and pain, indicating a real pathogen. The atrophy arises from insufficient internal organs; however, if one does not overexert themselves, there will be no pain, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi."},{"anchor":"trans-40p","marker":"40p","type":"translation","text":"**Treatment for Weakness** When a person suffers from complete depletion of vital energy and blood, resulting in multiple ailments throughout the body, they may experience continuous headaches accompanied by bone pain or abdominal pain along with pain in all four limbs. These symptoms, often indicative of weakness, should primarily be treated by addressing the Yangming stomach fire. However, if the stomach fire is overly vigorous and the body, including the limbs, becomes emaciated, one cannot solely target the stomach meridian. The formula consists of three qian each of ginseng, astragalus, white peony root, poria, white mustard seed, and angelica, five qian each of job's tears and plantago seeds, one qian of chrysanthemum flowers, one liang each of ophiopogon and cooked rehmannia, and five fen each of dried tangerine peel and fermented wheat. Boil these in three large bowls of water until it reduces to one bowl, and take this as a dose. While one might ordinarily use bamboo leaf and gypsum decoction when Yangming fire is excessive, the choice to utilize ginseng, poria, astragalus, and cooked herbs as the primary ingredients is made to replenish vital energy and blood. The stomach fire is so strong that it has already scorched the vital energy and blood; further use of the Baihu decoction would temporarily relieve the fire toxicity, but it would inevitably lead to a severe depletion of bodily fluids. Thus, it is preferable to use a large dose of tonifying herbs for energy and blood, as adequate hydration will naturally quell the fire."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"In the middle of the formula, one should appropriately use ingredients such as Yuan Shen, Mai Dong, and Gan Ju, which are purely meant to quell the spreading fire of the Yang Ming. Moreover, with the addition of Dang Gui and similar herbs to nourish blood and support the source, this is quite effective. However, if the dosage of these herbs is small, it not only fails to benefit but may actually exacerbate the fire’s intensity; this is the brilliance of this major treatment method. Generally, the major treatment method should be applied at the onset of deficiency conditions with excess stomach fire; using large doses can turn defeat into victory. If one hesitates and is cautious initially, fearing to use large doses, and waits until the stomach qi has weakened before realizing the need for large doses, it will be too late. For cases of weakness where the individual cannot get out of bed year-round, has a glowing complexion, weak and powerless feet, and cannot take a step, this indicates an excess of Yang Ming fire. It is unnecessary to treat the legs directly; instead, calming the stomach fire will naturally strengthen the legs. If one does not calm the stomach fire and only uses nourishing yin herbs, an increase in food intake will further weaken the legs. The method should include three taels of Yuan Shen, one tael each of Mai Dong and Shu Di, three qian of Gan Ju Hua, and one qian each of Ren Shen and Tu Si Zi, boiled with several bowls of water to yield four bowls of decoction. Allowing for unrestricted consumption will gradually calm the stomach fire, and the legs will naturally regain strength. Thus, this approach treats the legs indirectly.

The patient feels weak and cannot stand. People think this is due to deficiency, but it is not. This is due to extreme cold in the kidneys leading to a boiling fire; it appears as deficiency yet is not. At the onset, it was indeed due to the blazing fire of the yangming, and if cooled down, the stomach fire would diminish, while the kidney water would dry up, leading to nighttime coughing and phlegm. During the day, the patient feels somewhat better, groaning on the bed, eating little and slowly, and feeling increasingly uncomfortable. The prescription should be one tael of Yuan Shen, three taels of Mai Dong, and two taels of cooked dihuang, prepared with water. If there is liver fire, add five qian of Bai Shao and prepare with water. Four doses may allow the patient to get out of bed. Subsequently, a large dose of Six Flavor Decoction should be prepared, adding one tael each of Mai Dong and cooked dihuang, one qian of Wu Wei, four qian of Shan Zhu Yu, three qian each of Shan Yao and Dan Pi, and two qian each of Ze Xie and Fu Ling, brewed with water. The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of Yuan Shen and Mai Dong to nourish the lung metal and eliminate the wandering fire in the heart; it also excels in using cooked dihuang to replenish kidney water, which ensures there is enough water and strengthens the stomach fire.

After two doses, strength will return to the legs; after four doses, one should be able to walk. Ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes are all supreme tonics for qi, while ox knee and golden needle stone are divine remedies for strengthening the legs, making this combination effective. As for those with atrophy, they must lie in bed for a long time and cannot suddenly rise; what is the reason? All the symptoms of atrophy belong to the yangming stomach fire. When this fire exhausts the kidney essence, the bones become empty and without nourishment, making standing impossible. However, if only treating the yangming, when will the marrow in the bones be replenished? It is difficult to regain strength in both legs. The method is to use one liang each of yuanshen and ophiopogon, two liang of rehmannia, and two qian of ox knee, decocting and taking it. The brilliance of this formula lies in not treating the yangming, but directly addressing the kidney channel to replenish its deficiency.

The symptoms of weakness and atrophy are due to the excess fire of the Yangming. If the kidney's water is insufficient to nourish, then the bones become hollow and cannot support the body. The prescription should include three taels of rehmannia, three taels of shan zhu yu, two taels of mai dong, boiled in water and taken. The essence of this formula lies in the fact that rehmannia and shan zhu yu together enrich the water, while rehmannia removes the floating fire, and mai dong nourishes the lung's Yin, allowing Yin to flourish and Yang to diminish, naturally extinguishing the fire’s flame. Once the flame is extinguished, the metal and water will regenerate, there will be fluids in the organs, and the bone marrow will be replenished. Can the legs still be incapable of walking? Regarding the prescription for weakness, use three taels of coix, three taels of rehmannia, one tael of mai dong, one qian of north wuwu herb, and five qian of niu xi, boiled in water and taken.

When the lung metal has energy, it must flow down to generate kidney water. Despite the kidneys being shriveled, there will always be some moisture at night, and the kidney channel continually has vitality; hence, one survives and does not die. The prescription is to use half a pound of ophiopogon, one pound of cooked rehmannia, seven taels of rhemannia root, and one tael of schisandra, boiled in twenty bowls of water until six bowls remain.

After ten days, one will be able to walk, and after a month, one will return to normal. By greatly nourishing the water of the lungs and kidneys, the fire of the Yangming will cease to consume itself. The reason for atrophy lasting without death is that it stems from the moisture provided by the lungs, supported by the roots of the kidneys. If the kidney water had no roots, where would the night moisture needed for the lung metal arise from? I would simply see it as a withering.

If one does not replenish the kidneys and only aims to reduce the fire, there will be no hope of rejuvenation. Although treating atrophy often focuses on the Yangming (the stomach's fire), the stomach fire must certainly be reduced, while the kidney water must also be replenished. I now share an extraordinary formula that replenishes water amidst fire, reduces fire within water, harmonizes the stomach and kidneys, thus treating both conditions simultaneously. Naturally, bone marrow will increase, and burning heat will disperse; the atrophy will self-cure without direct treatment. This formula is named \"Jiang Bu Dan\" (Reinforcing and Reducing Pill): It consists of three qian of Ren Shen (Ginseng), one tael each of Shudi, Yuanshen, and Maidong, five qian each of Ganju Hua (Chrysanthemum), Shengdi (Raw Rehmannia), Shashen, and Digupi (Lycium Bark), and two qian of Cheqianzi (Plantago Seed); decoct in water for ingestion.

When a person has weak legs and cannot stand, yet their appetite remains strong, if they resist hunger even slightly, their head and face will feel hot, and they may have persistent coughing—this is also a sign of atrophy, as the heat of the stomach fire rushes upwards to the lung metal. The lung metal is pressured by fire, unable to transmit the clear and purifying energy to the lower abdomen, causing kidney water to dry up, the marrow in the bones to diminish, thus they cannot stand. Meanwhile, the fire of the stomach burns on, allowing them to eat well yet still hunger; over time, the water will dry up and the marrow will be depleted, leading to death—must we not urgently drain the fire from the stomach? However, if we drain the fire without supplementing the water, the stomach fire will have nothing to restrain it, making it hard to cease. The formula for awakening atrophy is as follows: [ingredients] cooked rehmannia, yam, and original root, each one tael; ginseng, Angelica sinensis, and white peony root, each five qian; white mustard seed three qian, fermented wheat two qian; decoct and consume. After one dose, the fire decreases; after two doses, the fire retreats; after ten doses, there will be signs of recovery from atrophy, and thirty doses may achieve complete healing.

Acupuncture The \"Lingshu Classic\" states: In spring, target the collaterals and major tendons between the flesh; in severe cases, go deep, in moderate cases, go shallow. In summer, target the skin, muscle, and collaterals on the surface. In autumn, target the joints, following the methods of spring. In winter, target the wells and collaterals, thus going deep and holding. This is the order of the four seasons, where qi resides, illnesses converge, and organs are suitably treated. For cramping, treat while standing; it can help restore function. For weakness, target while stretching; it can help with recovery. The Taiyang channel originates at Zhi Yin and connects at the Ming Men. The Ming Men is the eye. The Yangming channel originates at Li Dui and connects at the forehead. The forehead refers to the area near the ears. The Shaoyang channel originates at Qiao Yin and connects at the ear drum. Taiyang is for opening, Yangming is for closing, and Shaoyang is the pivot. Therefore, when open or twisted, it leads to muscle spasms and sudden illnesses. For acute diseases, target Taiyang, checking for excess or deficiency. An obstruction is when the skin feels burnt and weak. When closed or twisted, qi cannot settle, leading to atrophy. For atrophy, target Yangming, checking for excess or deficiency. When there is no settling, true qi is stagnant, and evil qi resides. If the pivot twists, the bones dislocate and cannot stabilize; thus, target Shaoyang, checking for excess or deficiency. Bone dislocation refers to loose joints that do not contract."},{"anchor":"trans-71p","marker":"71p","type":"translation","text":"The so-called \"bone channel\" refers to the origin of movement; it is important to investigate its root.

In reality, it is related to \"jue\" (numbness), while if it is empty, it leads to weakness and paralysis, making it impossible to rise from a seated position; this is its distinct feature. Weakness and numbness are like a constriction of the extremities, and the disease can be resolved with treatment twice a day. For those lacking sensation, it can be known in ten days; without interruption, the illness will cease. In febrile diseases, with a pale face and head pain, and restlessness in the limbs, treatment should be taken between the tendons, using the fourth needle in the four extremes. For limb paralysis, when the eyes are congested, the connection should be sought at the liver, but gold cannot be extracted there; gold represents the lung. These twelve evils are all the strange evils that invade the empty orifices. Thus, where the evil resides, there is deficiency. If the upper qi is insufficient, the brain feels unfulfilled, the ears suffer from ringing, the head feels heavy, and the eyes become dizzy. If the middle qi is deficient, urination and defecation become disrupted, and the intestines suffer from noises. If the lower qi is lacking, it leads to weakness and heart distress; it is necessary to replenish the area below the outer ankle. For weakness and heart distress, the needle should be inserted two inches above the big toe; another method is to replenish the area below the outer ankle.

Dazang and Taiquan relate to leg weakness and difficulty in walking. The point of Guangming concerns weakness that leaves one unable to rise from a sitting position.

Fengshi concerns both knees cramping, pain radiating to the side, stiffness, and a weak limb, which may appear blue, scorched, withered, or dark like rotting wood. Points such as Ququan, Fuyang, Tianchi, Daju, Zhigou, Xiaohai, Juegu, and Qiangu are related to the inability of the limbs to lift. The \"Medical Essentials\" states that needling for weakness should be brief: if lung heat causes the lungs to become dry and lead to wheezing, resulting in weakness akin to paralysis, with a pale complexion and the hair becoming disheveled, one should invigorate the area near the fish border and regulate the source point Taiyuan until the autumn season ends the illness. If heart heat gives rise to pulse weakness, with symptoms like blood in urine or joint fractures that do not align, the shins may suffer and lack support; if the color is red and the veins appear swollen, one should nourish the area around Laogong and regulate the source point Daling until the summer season ends the illness."},{"anchor":"trans-74p","marker":"74p","type":"translation","text":"When heat of the liver causes muscle atrophy, with downward discharge, bitter taste in the mouth, tight and spasmodic muscles, a pale complexion and dry nails, nourish its essence and regulate Tai Chong point, and the illness will be resolved by spring.

It is said that they are akin to guests of Yama. Why is this so? Because the afflictions reach an extreme, and no medical remedies can save them. These ailments arise from the six desires and seven emotions, influenced by the sun and moon, resulting in a depletion of the original essence and a deficiency of vital energy. When the physician employs only herbs from earth, stone, grass, and wood, how can they possibly replenish the primordial life? Thus, in the first volume of the \"Suwen,\" it is discussed that tranquility and non-action, along with a gathered spirit and interior preservation, are to cultivate true energy through stillness. Furthermore, the \"Lingshu\" mentions acupuncture and moxibustion as methods to regulate energy, capable of addressing stubborn ailments, where the eight methods of movement can abruptly awaken deep-seated illnesses. This can be seen in the ancient medical texts, which emphasize addressing the root of the ailment through the regulation of energy, achieving evident effects."},{"anchor":"trans-76p","marker":"76p","type":"translation","text":"Acupuncture has the effectiveness of tonification and purgation. The method of respiration related to the source gates allows for the circulation of energy. The principles of the bear and the bird can target both exterior and interior issues. Utilizing both methods instead of needles ultimately relates to the body and harmonizes with the universe, achieving a unified qi. If one can skillfully practice this, then even serious conditions may be treated without medication, which is to treat a person's body with the way of that person. The method of guiding and pulling, initially aimed to focus solely on seated exercises, has removed the guiding instruction. However, novice practitioners or those unable to perform these techniques can still learn and achieve healing without medicine during illness. For instance, if there is an affliction in the right hand, point the right fingers toward the right side, turning the head and looking to the left. The same applies for issues on the left. Perform the respiratory technique twenty-four times. If the left foot is affected, sit on a flat bench, place the left foot on the right knee, hold the heel with the left hand, and pull the toes with the right hand while turning the head to the left. The same applies to the right. Using force to pull can eliminate ailments caused by wind, cold, heat, and dampness and can address both recent and longstanding paralysis—this is invariably effective. In close practices, three lifts and three swallows, returning thoughts to the source, accumulating qi in a cycle, if the left side's energy is obstructed, focus the practice on the left hand; the same applies to the right side. Each side must circulate qi with diligent effort for a hundred days to fully open the meridians."},{"anchor":"trans-77p","marker":"77p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Fei Xue Lu\" states: A girl from a wealthy family in the same county as Ge Kejiu was about seventeen or eighteen years old. Her limbs were weak and withered, unable to feed herself, and her eyes were wide open. Many doctors could not cure her, so they called for Ge Kejiu. He looked at her and smiled, saying, \"This is not difficult to treat.\" He ordered everything fragrant in her room and the tassels to be removed, made a mound by digging the earth on the floor, carried the girl onto it, locked the door, and instructed her family to observe for movement in her hands and feet and to report to him. After a while, her hands and feet indeed moved, and she cried out. He threw a medicine ball, and the next day she was able to walk out from the mound. It was because this girl had a strong desire for fragrance, which had eroded her spleen due to its vapors. The \"Ru Men Shi Qin\" states: Three soldiers in Wanqiu were all suffering from atrophy and had not healed for many years. They had swelling and pain below the waist, sores all over their bodies, dim vision, dry lips, and a thirsty tongue, and they sought treatment from a doctor named Dai. Dai wanted to prescribe a purgative, but the two did not comply, as they were misled by other doctors on warm and tonifying medicine, and both died. A fellow patient, Song Ziyu, soon realized, \"They have already died from heat; I must change the treatment.\" He respectfully invited Dai. Dai said, \"Your illness has been treated with warm medicine for a long time; we must first get rid of that harmful medicine before addressing the root of the illness. I can prescribe a purgative of three hundred measures.\" Ziyu said, \"I respectfully follow your guidance.\" First, a massive dose of pills and Jun Chuan powder was given for purging, about a basin's worth, and reduced by a third the next day. His legs, which had previously felt numb, began to feel painful and itchy, and it wasn't until three hundred measures later that he finally felt at ease. Dai remarked, \"For atrophy, we should focus on the Yangming channel, which corresponds to the stomach and large intestine.\" This indicates that addressing the illness involves both acupuncture and medicine equally."},{"anchor":"trans-78p","marker":"78p","type":"translation","text":"A soldier named Song Ziyu from Chen, stationed in the city of Xi, suddenly fell ill with paralysis in June, unable to use his waist, knees, and legs, rendering him unable to walk.

I recalled the Inner Canon's teaching that internal fire can cause imbalances leading to cold conditions. Thus, I used salty water to penetrate his diaphragm and assess the presence of cold and retained phlegm; if there was retained food or drink in the upper abdomen, it could be expelled. Once the retained phlegm was eliminated, we then proceeded to purge. In the fluctuating intervals, he felt increasingly clear-minded, his appetite improved daily, and he gradually regained movement in his legs, with his knees extending as well. His heart energy was descending while his kidney energy was rising. I subsequently prescribed a decoction of Huang Lian to detoxify, adding Dang Gui and other herbs, along with Xie Xin Tang, Liang Ge San, and Chai Hu Yin Zi, preparing strong decoctions for him to sip on regularly."},{"anchor":"trans-79p","marker":"79p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Ten Books of Dongyuan\" states: The Secretary Shuping's feet, below the ankles, always felt warm.

He laughed and did not respond. At the age of fifty, he suffered from atrophy for half a year and died. The \"Danxi Heart Method\" says: The gentleman Wu from Dongyang, fifty years old, was stout and indulgent, often anxious and angry. His pulse was always deep and slippery. Starting from spring, he fell ill with phlegm and qi. The physician diagnosed him as having deficiency and cold, and mostly prescribed warming and drying fragrant medications. By April, his legs weakened, qi surged upward, and his appetite diminished, so he called me for treatment. I said: This is heat stagnation with spleen deficiency; symptoms of atrophy and weakness have developed. Although stout with a deep pulse, it is not a definite sign of death. However, the medication was overly fiery and at this time of excessive heat, survival was indeed difficult. I prescribed two pounds of bamboo juice with Bai Zhu paste, which helped lower qi and improve food intake. A month later, he sweated profusely and died. I write this as a warning for wise individuals, to avoid following the same path. The \"Xue Ji Medical Cases\" states: A scholar with a weak kidney due to accumulated labor had atrophy in his legs and could not walk; later, he became mute and had a dark complexion. I diagnosed him with kidney qi deficiency and cold, unable to circulate to the affected areas. I treated him with the Di Huang Yinzi and he recovered. Later, he carelessly regulated himself and relapsed. He used something similar to Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan, which caused significant phlegm and heat, resembling a stroke.

痿证奇方，用薏仁、熟地各三两，麦冬一两，北五味一钱，牛膝五钱，水煎服。此方之妙，妙在薏仁用至三两，则熟地不患太湿，麦冬不患太寒，牛膝不患太走，转能得三味之益，可以久服而成功也。"},{"anchor":"orig-45p","marker":"45p","type":"original","text":"痿证久不效者，阳明火烧尽肾水也。然能不死长存者何？盖肾水虽涸，而肺金终得胃气以生之，肺金有气，必下生肾水，肾虽干枯，终有露气夜润，肾经常有生机，故存而不死也。方用麦冬半斤，熟地一斤，元参七两，五味子一两，水二十碗，煎六碗，早晨服三碗，下午服二碗，半夜服一碗，一连二日，必能坐起。后改用熟地八两，元参三两，麦冬四两，北五味三钱，山茱萸四钱，牛膝一两，水十碗，煎二碗，早晨一碗，晚服一碗。十日即能行步，一月即平复如旧矣。盖大滋其肺肾之水，则阳明之火不消而自消矣。
