      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Gate of Emaciation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Natural State of Antiquity</strong></p>
<p>In modern times, people use wine as nectar and treat delusion as normal. They enter their chambers while intoxicated, seeking to exhaust their essence and dissipate their true nature. They do not know how to maintain fullness, fail to manage the spirit in due time, and strive to please their hearts in defiance of the joy of life. Their daily routines lack rhythm, and thus by the age of fifty they decline. </p>
<p>(Note: Wine can damage the spleen; when the spleen&#39;s energy is harmed, it cannot express the flavors of grains, leading to the depletion of vitality. Entering the chamber while intoxicated injures the essence, hence the decline by the age of fifty.)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>Taste harms form, qi harms essence, cold harms form, heat harms qi, qi harms pain, form harms swelling. [Note: Excessive flavors and qi in food can harm essence and form. Extreme cold harms form, while extreme heat harms qi; qi, being formless, causes pain, while yin, being formed, causes swelling.] Joy and anger harm qi, cold and heat harm form. Violent anger harms yin, violent joy harms yang. [Note: Emotions arise from within, thus they harm qi, while pathogens enter from outside, hence they harm form. Joy belongs to yang and anger belongs to yin, hence sudden and violent emotions harm both yin and yang.] At the age of forty, yin qi is already half, and daily activities weaken. [Note: For men, the period is measured in eights; by forty, they reach half, and kidney yin gradually diminishes, causing fatigue in daily life.]</p>
<p><strong>The Essential Treatise on Pulse</strong></p>
<p>To speak and then speak again after a day is to deplete qi. [Note: This indicates qi is weak and not continuous.]</p>
<p><strong>The True Organs Treatise of the Jade Machine</strong></p>
<p>The large bones are dry and withered, the large flesh sinks, there is fullness of qi in the chest, breathing is difficult, and the qi moves the form; death is expected within six months. When the true organ pulse is seen, I can give a prognosis. [Note: This heart condition affects the lungs.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The large bones are withered and dry, the flesh has sunk, the chest is full of qi, breathing is difficult, there is internal pain radiating to the shoulders and neck, and the person is expected to die within a month. Upon examining the true organs, I then predict the date of death. </p>
<p>The large bones are withered and dry, the flesh has sunk, the chest is full of qi, there is abdominal pain, discomfort in the heart, heat in the shoulders and neck, flesh is deteriorating, the eyes are sunken, and I predict death within ten days. </p>
<p>The large bones are withered and dry, the flesh has sunk, the marrow in the shoulders is wasting, movement is further declining, and when the true organs are observed, one is expected to die within a year. Upon seeing the true organs, I then predict the date of death. </p>
<p>The large bones are withered and dry, the flesh has sunk, the chest is full of qi, there is abdominal pain, discomfort in the heart, heat in the shoulders and neck, flesh deteriorating, the eyes sunken, and the person stands on the verge of death. If they see a person, they will die at the moment they cannot withstand. </p>
<p>Death due to the five vacuities. The pulse is thin, the skin is cold, qi is sparse, there is discharge both front and back, and food cannot be taken in; this is called the five vacuities. If porridge enters the stomach and the discharge stops, then the one who is vacuous can survive. </p>
<p>The thin pulse indicates heart qi deficiency; cold skin indicates lung qi deficiency; sparse qi indicates liver qi deficiency; discharge both front and back indicates kidney qi deficiency; inability to take in food indicates spleen qi deficiency, hence leading to death. If porridge enters the stomach and the discharge stops, and stomach qi is restored, then one can live.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Discussion on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>For the brave, the vital energy flows freely; for the timid, it becomes trapped and manifests as illness. </p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on the Five Vitalities</strong></p>
<p>The five labors cause harm: prolonged viewing injures the blood, prolonged lying down harms the energy, prolonged sitting injures the flesh, prolonged standing harms the bones, and prolonged walking injures the tendons. These are known as the five labors that cause harm.</p>
<p><strong>The Commentary on Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>When evil energy is strong, it leads to excess; when the essence is depleted, it results in deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on Fevers</strong></p>
<p>Where the evil gathers, its energy must surely be deficient. When yin is deficient, yang must gather to compensate.</p>
<p><strong>The Reversal Theory</strong></p>
<p>When the nourishing energy is deficient, compassion cannot flourish; when the protective energy is deficient, it becomes ineffective. When both the nourishing and protective energies are deficient, compassion cannot flourish and effectiveness is lost, while the flesh remains as before. A person in whom the body and will do not align will die.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>On Strange Diseases</strong></p>
<p>If a person with urinary retention urinates several times a day, and the Taiyin pulse is as thin as a hair, this indicates insufficiency. [Note: The earth&#39;s qi cannot rise and therefore leads to downward leakage; this signifies insufficiency of Taiyin.]</p>
<p><strong>On Pulse Explanation</strong></p>
<p>When there is internal deprivation leading to syncope, this indicates kidney deficiency. [Note: When yang is abundant outside, and it depletes the stored qi within, this results in kidney deficiency.]</p>
<p><strong>On Acupuncture Intention</strong> </p>
<p>When the qi is full and the body is robust, or when the qi is weak and the body is frail, this is the norm; any reversal indicates illness. When food intake is abundant and the qi is strong, or when food intake is insufficient and the qi is weak, this is the norm; any reversal indicates illness. When the pulse is strong and the blood is plentiful, or when the pulse is weak and the blood is scarce, this is the norm; any reversal indicates illness. If the qi is weak yet the body is warm, this indicates reversal; if there is much food intake and little qi, this indicates reversal; if there is little food intake but much qi, this indicates reversal; if the pulse is strong but the blood is scant, this indicates reversal; if the pulse is weak but the blood is abundant, this indicates reversal. [Note: The oppositions of qi and food, and the changes in blood and pulse, are all due to disharmony of intention, which allows for the invasion of pathogenic qi.] Hence, abundance indicates the entrance of qi, while deficiency indicates the exit of qi. When the qi is full, it is hot; when the qi is deficient, it is cold. [Note: The deficient must lead to abundance; when qi enters, it fills up; the abundant must lead to deficiency; when qi exits, it depletes. This speaks to the opening and closing of qi.]</p>
<p><strong>On Regulating the Menstrual Cycle</strong><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The heart houses the spirit; when the spirit is abundant, laughter is unceasing, while when it is insufficient, sadness prevails. </p>
<p>The lungs contain qi; when qi is abundant, there is panting and coughing, and when it is insufficient, breathing becomes shallow. </p>
<p>The liver stores blood; when blood is abundant, there is anger, and when it is insufficient, there is fear. </p>
<p>The spleen contains flesh; when form is abundant, the abdomen is bloated and urination is difficult, whereas when it is insufficient, the limbs become weak. </p>
<p>The kidneys store will; when will is abundant, there is abdominal bloating and diarrhea, but when it is insufficient, there is faintness. </p>
<p>The deficiency of qi results in blood deficiency, and the deficiency of blood results in qi deficiency. </p>
<p>What is present is deemed real, and what is absent is deemed void. Therefore, when there is a deficiency of qi, there is no blood, and when there is a deficiency of blood, there is no qi. Currently, the loss between blood and qi leads to this deficiency.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If blood combines with yin, then yin is cold and abundant, while the qi within the blood is also lacking. If qi combines with yang, then yang is hot and abundant, while the blood divided by qi is diminished. When blood and qi are lost to each other and cannot harmonize, both become deficient. The emperor asked, how does yin generate fullness? Qi Bo replied: If emotions like joy and anger are unregulated, then the yin qi rises in reverse. When it rises in reverse, the lower body becomes deficient, and in turn, the yang qi escapes; therefore, it is called fullness. The emperor then asked, how does yin generate emptiness? Qi Bo replied: Joy causes qi to descend, while sorrow causes qi to dissipate. When it dissipates, the pulse becomes empty; when coupled with cold food and drink, the cold qi fills the body. Thus, blood weeps and qi departs, which is why it is called emptiness. </p>
<p>If yang is deficient, external cold prevails; if yin is deficient, internal heat arises. </p>
<p>The Spirit Classic</p>
<p>Deciding Qi Chapter</p>
<p>When essence is lost, one suffers from deafness. When qi is lost, one experiences dim vision. Loss of fluids leads to open pores and excessive sweating. Loss of essence results in bones not functioning well, a pallid complexion, brain and marrow wasting away, and aches in the shins, with frequent ringing in the ears. When blood is lost, the complexion becomes pale and lacks luster, while the pulse is empty; this is the indication.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Sea of Qi</h3>
<p>When the Sea of Qi is insufficient, then the Qi is too little to speak.<br><em>Note: Insufficiency in the Sea of Qi leads to insufficient Qi, hence one cannot speak.</em></p>
<p>When the Sea of Blood is insufficient, one often perceives oneself as small, narrow, and not aware of the cause of one&#39;s illness.<br><em>Note: Blood in the Chong Meridian is distributed throughout the body; when insufficient, one feels small and narrow without knowing the reason for the illness.</em></p>
<p>When the Sea of Food and Water is insufficient, hunger does not allow one to accept grains.<br><em>Note: Insufficient stomach Qi leads to hunger without the ability to consume grains.</em></p>
<p>When the Sea of Marrow is insufficient, the brain spins, ears ring, legs ache, one experiences dizziness, and there is a tendency towards laziness and sleeping.<br><em>Note: Insufficiency in the Sea of Marrow depletes essence. Essence is what moistens the orifices. Hence, the ringing in the ears and the inability to see. When fluids are depleted, the bones are unable to bend and stretch effectively, resulting in aching legs and a tendency towards laziness and sleeping.</em></p>
<h3>Separate Treatise on the Five Loos</h3>
<p>When Yin and Yang are not harmonious, liquids overflow and flow downwards into the Yin, depleting the marrow, and excessive downward flow leads to vacuity, which causes pain in the lower back and ache in the legs.<br><em>Note: When the Qi of Yin and Yang is not harmonious, the fluids and essence cannot combine, causing liquids to overflow outside the bones and flow down into the Yin. Excessive outflow leads to vacuity of the bones, resulting in back pain and aches in the legs.</em><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sixth Difficulty:</strong> It is said that when the pulse shows a predominance of Yin and deficiency of Yang, and when there is a predominance of Yang and deficiency of Yin, what does this mean? Indeed. The floating pulse indicates a small deficiency, while the sinking pulse indicates a significant presence, hence the term &quot;Yin excess and Yang deficient.&quot; Conversely, a sinking pulse indicates a small deficiency and a floating pulse indicates a significant presence, hence &quot;Yang excess and Yin deficient.&quot; This reflects the essence of Yin and Yang regarding deficiency and abundance.</p>
<p><strong>The Eighth Difficulty:</strong> What does it mean when the pulse at the wrist is flat and the person is dead? Indeed. The twelve primary channels are all connected to the origin of vital energy. What is meant by the origin of vital energy is the root of the twelve channels, which refers to the movement of energy within the kidneys. This is the foundation of the five organs and six bowels, the root of the twelve channels, the gateway of respiration, and the origin of the Triple Burner, also known as the guardian spirit of evils. Therefore, Qi is the foundation of a person; if its source is cut off, the stalks and leaves wither. When the pulse at the wrist is flat and the person is dead, it indicates that vital energy is uniquely cut off within.</p>
<p><strong>The Eleventh Difficulty:</strong> The texts say that if the pulse does not fill after fifty beats and then stops, and one organ is without Qi, which organ is it? Indeed. When a person inhales, it is the Yin that enters; when they exhale, it is the Yang that goes out. If the inhalation does not reach the kidneys or the liver and return, then it can be understood that if one organ is without Qi, it is because the kidney Qi has already been depleted.</p>
<p><strong>The Twelfth Difficulty:</strong> The texts say that when the pulse of the five organs has been depleted internally, treating it with needles will only strengthen the exterior; when the pulse of the five organs has been depleted externally, treating it with needles will only strengthen the interior. How can one distinguish between the internal and external depletion? Indeed. When the pulse of the five organs has been depleted internally, the Qi of the kidneys and liver has already been exhausted internally, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the heart and lungs; when the pulse of the five organs has been depleted externally, the pulse of the heart and lungs has been depleted externally, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the kidneys and liver.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Yang supplements Yin, and Yin supplements Yang; this is called the real and the void, diminishing the insufficient and augmenting the abundant. Thus, those who die have their lives taken by medicine. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Fourteen Difficulties,&quot; it is asked: What is meant by the pulse having loss? Indeed. The pulse of arrival comes once with one breath, twice it is called &quot;normal,&quot; thrice it is &quot;disengaged from the path,&quot; four times it is &quot;deprived of essence,&quot; five times it denotes &quot;death,&quot; and six times it signals &quot;life&#39;s end&quot;; these are the pulses of arrival. What is meant by loss? With one breath and one pulse it is called &quot;disengaged from the path,&quot; with two breaths and one pulse it is &quot;deprived of essence,&quot; with three breaths and one pulse it indicates &quot;death,&quot; and with four breaths and one pulse it signifies &quot;life&#39;s end&quot;; these are the pulses of loss. The arrival pulse moves from below to above, while the loss pulse moves from above to below. </p>
<p>What illness does the loss pulse indicate? Indeed.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>When there is a loss affecting the skin and hair, the skin gathers but the hair falls out; when there is a loss affecting the blood vessels, the blood becomes deficient, unable to nourish the internal organs; when there is a loss affecting the muscles, the muscles shrink, and food cannot benefit the skin; when there is a loss affecting the tendons, the tendons become slack and cannot hold themselves; when there is a loss affecting the bones, the bones become weak and one cannot rise from bed. The reversal of this leads to the manifestation of illness. Those whose bones are weak and cannot rise from bed will perish if they are affected from below to above. Conversely, those whose skin gathers but hair falls will perish if affected from above to below.</p>
<p>What are the methods to treat these losses? Indeed. For damage to the lungs, one should benefit their qi; for damage to the heart, one should adjust the nourishment and defense; for damage to the spleen, one should regulate diet and adapt to cold and warmth; for damage to the liver, one should soothe the interior; for damage to the kidneys, one should nourish the essence. This is the method to treat losses.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the pulse comes with each breath, each inhalation and exhalation signifies a loss. Even if a person can walk, they ought still to stay in bed, for the blood and qi are both insufficient. When the breath comes again with each inhalation, and breathing returns, this is referred to as the absence of soul.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Those without a soul are destined to die. Although a person may still move, they are termed a &quot;walking corpse.&quot; The Twenty-Four Difficulties states: when the three Yin and three Yang energies of the hands and feet are completely exhausted, how can one determine their fate? Can one know if it is fortunate or unfortunate? Yes. When the lesser Yin energy of the foot is exhausted, the bones become desiccated. The lesser Yin corresponds to the winter pulse, which hides and warms in the bone marrow; thus, if the bone marrow is not warm, the flesh does not adhere to the bones, and the bones and flesh become estranged. Consequently, the flesh is moist yet recedes, leading to elongated and withered teeth, and hair lacking luster. A lack of luster means the bones die first. On a Wu day, there is a serious condition; on a Ji day, there is death. </p>
<p>When the greater Yin energy of the foot is exhausted, the pulses do not nourish the mouth and lips. The mouth and lips are the foundation of the flesh. When the pulses do not nourish, the flesh becomes lacking in moisture; if the flesh is not moist, it becomes full; when the flesh is full, the lips turn inward, and when the lips turn inward, the flesh dies first. On a Jia day, there is a serious condition; on a Yi day, there is death.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>When the energy of the Foot Jueyin is exhausted, the tendons contract, pulling the ovaries and causing the tongue to curl. Jueyin refers to the liver meridian. The liver is connected to the tendons. The tendons gather in the genital area and are linked to the root of the tongue. Therefore, when the pulse does not flow, the tendons contract excessively, pulling on the ovaries and causing the tongue to curl and the ovaries to shrink. The tendons are the first to perish. On a Geng day, they are severely affected; on a Xin day, they die.</p>
<p>When the energy of the Hand Taiyin is exhausted, the skin and hair become scorched. Taiyin refers to the lungs, which regulate the flow of energy and warmth to the skin and hair. When the energy does not nourish, the skin and hair become scorched. When the skin is scorched, fluids are depleted; when fluids are depleted, the skin and joints are damaged; when the skin and joints are damaged, the skin withers and hair breaks. When the hair breaks, it is the first to perish. On a Bing day, they are severely affected; on a Ding day, they die.</p>
<p>When the energy of the Hand Shaoyin is exhausted, the pulse does not circulate, and when the pulse does not circulate, the blood does not flow. When the blood does not flow, the complexion fades, resulting in a face as dark as clay. This blood is the first to perish. On a Ren day, it is severely affected; on a Gui day, it dies.</p>
<p>When the energies of all three Yin are completely exhausted, it leads to dizziness and closed eyes. Closed eyes signify the loss of will. The loss of will means the will has perished, which is reflected in the closed eyes.</p>
<p>When the energies of all six Yang are completely exhausted, Yin and Yang are separated. When Yin and Yang are separated, the pores leak, causing sweating that resembles large beads of dew, which drips out but does not flow; this indicates that the vital energy is the first to perish. If one predicts in the morning, death occurs in the evening; if one predicts in the evening, death occurs in the morning.</p>
<p>The &quot;Forty-Eight Difficulties&quot; states: A person has three vacuities and three realities. What does this mean? Indeed, it refers to the vacuity and reality of the pulse, the vacuity and reality of diseases, and the vacuity and reality of diagnosis. The vacuity of the pulse is characterized by a weak pulse; the reality is indicated by a tight, firm pulse.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The distinction between emptiness and fullness in illness: outward manifestations indicate emptiness, while inward manifestations indicate fullness; verbal expressions indicate emptiness, while silence indicates fullness; slow conditions indicate emptiness, while rapid conditions indicate fullness. The examination of emptiness and fullness shows that soft textures indicate emptiness, while firm textures indicate fullness; itching indicates emptiness, while pain indicates fullness; external pain with internal comfort indicates external fullness and internal emptiness, while internal pain with external comfort indicates internal fullness and external emptiness. Thus, it is said to be emptiness and fullness.</p>
<p>In the Eighty-One Difficulties it states: The classic says there are no true fullness and emptiness, diminishing the insufficient and increasing the excessive—is this referring to the pulse at the wrist? Does the illness inherently possess emptiness and fullness? How is the gain and loss to be understood? Indeed, illness does not refer specifically to the pulse at the wrist but indicates that illness itself possesses emptiness and fullness. For example, if the liver is full and the lungs are empty—wood represents the liver, and metal represents the lungs. Wood and metal should be balanced, and it should be known that metal should balance wood. If the lungs are full and the liver is empty, even with minimal qi, if one needles and does not tonify the liver but instead reinforces the fullness of the lungs, thus it is said, true fullness and emptiness, diminishing the insufficient and increasing the excessive. This is the harm caused by the middle practitioner.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Golden Coffer Essentials</strong><br><strong>[Han – Zhang Ji]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Exhaustion</strong>  </p>
<p>Men labor excessively, and extreme exhaustion also causes strain. A man with a pale complexion is prone to thirst and blood loss, suddenly experiencing wheezing and palpitations; a floating pulse indicates internal deficiency. A man with a weak, sinking, and thin pulse, without cold or heat, shortness of breath, urgency within, hindered urination, pale complexion, occasionally closed eyes along with nosebleeds, and fullness in the lower abdomen suffers from labor-related conditions.  </p>
<p>The disease of overwork presents with a large, floating pulse, and restlessness in the limbs; it is severe in spring and summer but recovers in autumn and winter, with Yin-cold essence spontaneously emerging, leading to weakness and inability to act. A man with a weak, floating pulse and distended state may have infertility, characterized by clear cold essence.  </p>
<p>In cases of sperm loss, a man shows tightness and urgency in the lower abdomen, cold sensations in the genital region, dizziness (or eye socket pain), hair loss, and an extremely weak, hollow, and slow pulse, indicative of vital essence loss and blood deficiency. If the pulse is slightly moving and tightened, it suggests male infertility; for women, dreaming of sexual encounters indicates the same issue, treated with Guizhi Longgu Muli Decoction. A man with a weak, fine pulse experiences night sweats.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>At the age of fifty or sixty, if a person has significant pulse issues, experiencing numbness and pain radiating from the back, or sounds in the intestines similar to the noise of a knife, these are all due to overexertion. </p>
<p>If the pulse is deep, thin, and slow, it is termed &quot;escaping qi.&quot; Such a person will have shortness of breath when walking quickly, cold hands and feet, a distended abdomen, and in severe cases, diarrhea and poor digestion. </p>
<p>If the pulse is tense and large, it indicates depletion; when it&#39;s large, it denotes a hollow state, depletion suggests coldness, and hollowness signifies deficiency, and if cold and deficiency collide, it is termed &quot;revolution.&quot; A woman might have excessive menstrual flow, while a man may suffer from loss of blood and sperm. Symptoms of deficiency include restlessness, palpitations, abdominal pain, nocturnal emissions, aching limbs, hot hands and feet, and dryness in the throat and mouth. For this, the Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction is prescribed.</p>
<p>For deficiencies associated with restlessness, the Huang Qi Jian Zhong Decoction is recommended. </p>
<p>For deficiency-related lower back pain, cramping in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, the Ba Wei Shen Qi Wan is indicated. </p>
<p>For general deficiency with various ailments, the Shan Yao Wan is advised. </p>
<p>For insomnia due to deficiency and restlessness, the Suan Zao Tang is the remedy. </p>
<p>In cases of extreme deficiency from excessive labor, causing emaciation and abdominal distention along with inability to eat, from various causes like dietary strain, emotional distress, or excessive sexual activity, leading to internal stagnation, seeping blood, skin problems, and darkening of the eyes, a combination of Ban Xia and various herbal treatments is typically recommended to restore balance.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>The Essentials of Illness in Relation to Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>There are deficiencies in the organs and in the bowels, both upper and lower, each presenting differently, requiring deep investigation. Symptoms include rumbling of the intestines, coldness in the feet and hands, inability to digest food, spontaneous vomiting, skin and hair becoming emaciated, muscles appearing wrinkled, blurred vision and hearing, a broken voice, shortness of breath while walking, and a disordered spirit. These indicate deficiency in the five organs. </p>
<p>When diagnosing the pulse, one must raise the fingers lightly and palpate gently. Observe where the pulse is located to determine which organ is affected. If the pulse feels deep, small, weak, short, and soft, all indicate organ deficiency. For deficiencies, the appropriate treatment is to nourish and supplement, as this is the common approach. Symptoms such as skin itching, bloating of the muscles, inability to digest food and drink, and loose stools that do not cease, indicate deficiency in the bowels. When checking the pulse lightly, it feels slippery; when pressing harder, it feels even. This response reflects bowel deficiency. Assess which meridian is involved, and correct the timing accordingly.</p>
<p>Symptoms such as a flushed face, tremulous movements, hoarse voice, dry lips and mouth, shortness of breath and fatigue, lack of color in the face, and swelling of the jaw suggest upper deficiency. Difficulties with urination and defecation, fluctuations in appetite, heaviness in the waist and feet as if sitting in water, difficulty in walking, surging upward of qi, and anxious dreams indicate lower deficiency. If the patient’s pulse is weak, slippery, short, and small, it all pertains to lower deficiency.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p>
<h3>Theory of Labor and Injury</h3>
<p>Labor affects the spirit and energy, while injury affects the physical form. Excessive hunger and fullness harm the spleen; excessive thought and contemplation harm the heart; excessive desires and passions harm the kidneys; excessive routines and lifestyles harm the liver; excessive joy, anger, sorrow, and worry harm the lungs. Additionally, external factors like wind, cold, heat, and humidity cause injury from outside, while hunger, fullness, and labor result in internal damage. Illness occurs from external factors during the day, and from internal factors at night. Vital energy (rong) and protective energy (wei) circulate, functioning according to day and night. </p>
<p>Labor starts with one, then leads to two, which transmits to three, three connects to four, four influences five, and five returns to one. When it reaches five, the pathogenic factors become deep, genuine energy is lost, leading to weakness in muscles and spirit, reduced appetite, and difficulty in movement. When this happens, even if life persists, it cannot thrive. </p>
<p>Thus, the theory on regulating spirit and energy states: regulating spirit and energy, avoiding alcohol and lust, moderating routine, reducing thoughts, and minimizing rich flavors are foundational to longevity. </p>
<p>When diagnosing the pulse, if it is excessively numerous, rapid, thin, weak, faint, slippery, short, long, floating, sinking, tense, string-like, surging, or firm, all these arise from labor and injury.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Transmission of Corpse Theory</strong></p>
<p>The transmission of the corpse does not come from one family’s affliction. When a person’s vital energy weakens and their organs become frail, they are influenced by ghostly energy, and as a result, they contract illness from its malignance. Symptoms may include persistent coughing, a feeling of fullness in the stomach and diaphragm, heavy pain in the limbs, skin wasting away, inability to eat, irregular vomiting and diarrhea, vomiting of pus and blood, excessive thirst, an inclination for singing, a tendency towards sorrow, sudden seizures, or difficulty in urination and defecation. These conditions may arise from consuming food and drink, exposure to wind and rain, mourning the sick or deceased, traveling during the day and night, gathered emotions, or the flow of blood. They can also occur from lying exposed in fields or encountering it by chance in gardens. The accumulation of deathly energy leads to illness, hence it is called the transmission of the corpse.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Symptoms of Exhaustive Illness Leading to Death</strong></p>

Additionally, swelling in the feet indicates death in nine days.<br>If the spleen fails, with a cold mouth, swelling in the feet, and an inability to sense bloating or diarrhea, death occurs within twelve days.<br>If the muscles fail, with a shocked spirit, fear, blue fingernails and toenails, and incessant verbal outbursts, death occurs in eight or nine days.<br>If the liver fails, with sweating profusely like water, anxiety and fear, lying down with eyes staring and a blue face, death occurs in eight days, or may happen instantly.<br>If the stomach fails, with tooth loss and a yellow face, death occurs in seven days; alternatively, it may take ten days.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p>
<h3>Symptoms of Organ Deficiency and Exhaustion</h3>
<p>The liver pulse is described as taut and long, indicating balance. If it is strong yet weak, it signifies insufficiency, with the illness located internally; if it is lacking, it results in chest and sides feeling bloated, akin to being captured. In a state of deficiency, one dreams of flowers and soft grass, experiences heat and aversion to cold, has limbs unable to move, and the pulse should be taut and rapid, but instead is short and weak. This situation indicates that metal is overcoming wood, leading to death in ten days if left untreated. </p>
<p>A deficiency in the gallbladder leads to a cold condition characterized by fear, dizziness, and inability to sleep alone. A weak pulse at the guan position suggests gallbladder deficiency. If yang is deficient, it indicates total gallbladder failure.</p>
<p>The heart pulse is characterized by a strong pulse on intake and a weak one on release, resembling a string of beads; when it cycles smoothly, it indicates balance. If strong on intake but weak on release, it signifies insufficiency, with the illness located internally, causing restlessness, cough and phlegm from above, and airflow deficiency below. A deficient heart manifests as fear of people, closing the eyes and wanting to sleep, lack of spirit, chaotic soul and spirit, excessive fear and surprise, grief and lack of joy, pain in the chest and abdomen, tremulous speech, aversion to cold, confusion, flushed face and yellow eyes, along with excessive bleeding. A diagnosis reveals weakness and delicacy in both the left and right inch positions.</p>
<p>Deficiency in the small intestine leads to cold conditions resulting in purulent blood leakage, or even black water, with a floating and weak pulse at the left inch position, soft and unable to sustain pressure. This condition reflects mental disturbance and lack of stability, leading to an empty feeling and inability to speak.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>When the spleen is weak, there are multiple issues such as a strong desire to eat sour foods, persistent dysentery, inability to retain essence, and an inability to control urination. The pulse is like the distance between a bird&#39;s talons, indicating insufficiency. This internal ailment causes fullness and a lack of appetite, fatigue, weak extremities, excessive salivation, swelling of the limbs, irregular diarrhea, and dreams of eating. When spleen qi is deficient, stool is loose, there may be frequent urination, and sweating may not stop. The five bodily fluids descend, leading to color changes in the stool, while dreams of insufficient food arise.</p>
<p>When the stomach is weak, there is noisy distension in the intestines, leading to slippery diarrhea; insufficiency causes excessive hunger and indigestion. A pulse that is floating and large indicates deficiency, and a floating but slightly slippery pulse also signifies weakness.</p>
<p>When the lungs are weak, there is coldness, leading to cough and breathlessness, as well as slippery bowel movements and diminished strength, often accompanied by a sense of sadness. A pulse that feels fine and light indicates insufficiency, causing internal issues that lead to wheezing and coughing, with blood in the upper airways and signs of illness in the lower. Additionally, coughing may lead to involuntary urination due to the upper part being unable to control the lower. If weakness is severe, it results in exhaustion and shortness of breath, along with a feeling of fullness in the right side of the abdomen and shortness of speech.</p>
<p>If the large intestine is deficient and cold, the diarrhea is variable. Also, weakness can result in a desire for fullness, causing cough and a sensation of a blockage in the throat.</p>
<p>The kidney pulse is soft and equal, but if it is weak, the condition indicates deficiency. This may result in a feeling of anxiety, abdominal fullness in the small intestine, and slippery, discolored urine. Weakness leads to chest pain, dreams involving boats drowning people, insufficient essence in the kidneys, radiating pain in the back and waist, and a feeling of hunger when full. Additionally, there may be hoarseness, breathlessness, and coughing up blood, indicative of kidney deficiency and cold, with the breath feeling nearly extinguished.</p>
<p>A deficiency in the bladder can cause air to enter the lungs.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The Sanjiao (Triple Burner) is the vital energy of a person. If the upper burner is deficient, it cannot control the lower; leading to incontinence, swelling of the head and face. If the middle burner is deficient, it results in rumbling and bloating of the intestines. If the lower burner is deficient and cold, it causes continuous leaking of urine and feces.</p>
<p>In cases of liver injury, the person may lose flesh and have a desire for their mouth to be open while lying down, with bluish hands and feet, closed eyes, and pain in the pupils; this is due to injury to the liver. The pulse in the left wrist&#39;s guan position indicates deficiency in the liver&#39;s yin, affecting the foot&#39;s jueyin channel. The person suffers from hardness below the ribs, alternating chills and fever, fullness of the abdomen without desire for food and drink, bloating, and a feeling of melancholy; this is referred to as cold from liver deficiency. </p>
<p>If both yin and yang are weak in the pulse at the left wrist&#39;s guan position, it indicates deficiencies in both the foot&#39;s jueyin and shaoyang channels. The person may appear confused, experience a loss of consciousness, have hallucinations, inability to speak, and frequent fright; this is known as deficiency in both the liver and gallbladder. For those suffering from liver disorders, it is advised to nourish the heart&#39;s qi to benefit it, as a robust heart can influence the liver. </p>
<p>When a person resists the spring energy, the foot&#39;s shaoyang chi fails to generate, leading to changes within the liver&#39;s qi. Following the natural flow brings life; opposing it brings death. Aligning with the flow promotes healing; resistance leads to chaos. When one opposes the natural flow, it is termed &quot;guan ge,&quot; which signifies the onset of illness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>When the heart is injured, the person feels fatigued and heavy, the face may turn red, and there is a deep pain in the chest and back. They experience a sense of heat and pulsing around the navel, and their pulse is wiry; this is caused by injury to the heart. </p>
<p>For those with a weak yang pulse in the left hand, it indicates a deficiency in the foot Shaoyang meridian. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, weakness, inability to move the toes, paralysis, and yellowish eyes; this is called cold due to liver deficiency. </p>
<p>When one cries out from distress, it shows a lack of blood and qi. A deficiency in blood and qi is linked to the heart. If the heart qi is weak, the person may feel fearful, sleepy, and dream of wandering far, their spirit scattered; the soul may act irrationally. If the yin energy is deficient, it can lead to madness, and if the yang energy is deficient, it can result in mania. The five organs are the dwelling places of the soul, where the spirit finds its support. When the soul soars, it indicates emptiness in the five organs, which allows evil spirits to inhabit them, leading to disturbances from supernatural entities.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>When the pulse is short and weak, and the organs are insufficient, the soul and spirit are unsettled. The soul belongs to the liver, and the spirit belongs to the lungs. The lungs govern bodily fluids, which manifest as tears. When lung Qi is deficient, tears flow; when liver Qi is weak, the soul is restless. The liver is associated with anger, its voice calls out.</p>
<p>In the pulse of the left wrist before the cun and guan positions, if it shows a deficiency in Yin, it corresponds to the hand&#39;s Shaoyin channel. Patients may suffer from palpitations, anxiety, unhappiness, heart and abdominal pain, difficulty in speech, a feeling of coldness in the heart, and a sense of confusion, which is termed &quot;heart deficiency with cold.&quot;</p>
<p>In the pulse of the left wrist before the cun and guan positions, if it shows a deficiency in Yang, it corresponds to the hand&#39;s Taiyang channel. Patients may suffer from headaches at the crown and pain in the ears and cheeks, referred to as &quot;small intestine deficiency with cold.&quot;</p>
<p>In the pulse of the left wrist before the cun and guan positions, if both Yin and Yang are deficient, it indicates that both the Shaoyin and Jueyin channels are affected. Patients may experience frequent diarrhea, discomfort due to cold and a lack of energy, cold limbs, and abdominal distress, termed &quot;heart and small intestine deficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>For those suffering from heart labor, nourishing the spleen&#39;s Qi is beneficial, as the spleen is closely connected to the heart.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>When one opposes the summer heat, the hand&#39;s Yang fails to thrive, and the heart&#39;s Qi becomes internally stagnant. Following it leads to life; opposing it leads to death. Following it brings order; opposing it brings chaos. Reversing the natural order is termed obstruction, resulting in illness.</p>
<p>When the Spleen Qi is weak, there are ailments such as downward flow of fluids, intestinal remnants, hard stool, inability to change clothing, and endless sweating, all referred to as weak Spleen Qi, which may involve the five bodily fluids descending in various colors: green, yellow, red, white, and black.</p>
<p>In cases of Yin deficiency manifested in the right hand&#39;s pulse at the Guan position, it is associated with the Foot Taiyin channel. Symptoms include painful diarrhea, abdominal distension, Qi rebelling upward, cholera-like vomiting, persistent restlessness, intestinal rumbling—commonly referred to as Spleen deficiency with cold.</p>
<p>In cases of Yang deficiency identified in the right hand&#39;s pulse at the Guan position, it is linked to the Foot Yangming channel. Symptoms include cold and pain in the shins leading to an inability to lie down, aversion to wind and cold, rapid eyes, abdominal pain with emptiness, intermittent chills and fever, dry lips and mouth, and facial swelling—known as Stomach deficiency with cold.</p>
<p>When both Yin and Yang are deficient in the right hand&#39;s pulse at the Guan position, it indicates a deficiency in both the Foot Taiyin and Yangming channels.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>When suffering from illness, the stomach feels empty and there is insufficient breath, accompanied by extreme cold and continuous diarrhea; this is called deficiency of both the spleen and stomach. For those with spleen-related ailments, nourishing the lung qi to strengthen it is beneficial, as a vigorous lung will influence the spleen. Therefore, the wise cultivate yang energy in spring and summer, and nourish yin energy in autumn and winter, in accordance with their fundamental nature. The liver and heart represent yang, while the spleen, lungs, and kidneys represent yin. Disrupting their roots undermines their essence. The interplay of yin and yang with the seasons encompasses the beginnings and ends of all things.</p>
<p>When the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s cun (寸) position shows yin deficiency, it pertains to the hand taiyin channel. Symptoms include insufficient breath, dry throat, and lack of bodily fluids, which is termed lung deficiency and cold. Conversely, when the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s cun position shows yang deficiency, it is related to the hand yangming channel. Symptoms include chest tightness, wheezing, intestinal rumbling, thirst, dry lips, and urgent eyes, which is termed large intestine deficiency and cold.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>When the pulse at the inch of the right hand is weak in both yin and yang, it indicates that both the Taiyin and Yangming channels are deficient. The patient suffers from tinnitus, often perceives light inappropriately, feels unhappy, or experiences fear, which is called deficiency of the lungs and large intestine.</p>
<p>For lung-related illnesses, tonifying kidney qi can help. The kidneys govern and influence the lungs. If a person resists the autumn climate, the Taiyin will not function properly, leading to excess lung qi. Following the seasonal changes promotes life; resisting them leads to death. Complying results in treatment; resisting leads to chaos. Opposite actions become harmful, which is termed Stagnation, causing illness to arise.</p>
<p>When the pulse at the middle of the left hand&#39;s wrist is weak in yin, it relates to the Foot Shaoyin channel. The patient suffers from chest tightness, heaviness in the lower body with swelling, not being able to bear pressure, indicating kidney yang deficiency.</p>
<p>When the pulse at the middle of the right hand&#39;s wrist is weak in yin, it also pertains to the Foot Shaoyin channel. The patient experiences weakness in the legs and calves, intolerance to cold, a faint pulse that sometimes is absent, cold feet with heavy lower limbs, difficulty walking, abdominal distension, chest tightness, pain radiating to the sides, indicating kidney yang deficiency.</p>
<p>When the pulse at the middle of the left hand&#39;s wrist is weak in both yin and yang, it indicates deficiency in both the Foot Shaoyin and Taiyang channels.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The pain of illness is minor, yet the heart aches and the back feels cold; at times, the lower abdomen is full, known as the deficiency of both the kidney and bladder. When the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s Shenmen indicates a deficiency of both Yin and Yang, it signifies a deficiency in the foot&#39;s Shaoyin and Taiyang channels. The illness includes heart pain, feeling as if there is a heavy load that cannot be contained, causing frequent, painful, and cold leakage. Both the kidney and heart suffer, referred to as the deficiency of the kidney and bladder.</p>
<p>When the pulse at the left wrist&#39;s Shenmen shows Yang deficiency, it pertains to the foot&#39;s Taiyang channel. The illness involves tightness in the muscles of the feet, abdominal pain radiating to the lower back, inability to bend or stretch, cramping, sensitivity to wind, and unilateral lower back pain, known as cold deficiency of the bladder.</p>
<p>When the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s Shenmen suggests Yang deficiency, it relates to the foot&#39;s Taiyang channel. The condition includes muscle tremors, tension in the feet, sudden hearing loss, sensitivity to wind with a whistling sound, and is called cold deficiency of the bladder.</p>
<p>For those with kidney fatigue, one should nourish the liver Qi to support it; the liver governs and thus affects the kidneys. If one goes against the winter energy, the Shaoyin of the feet does not store, leading to muddy kidney energy.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>To follow the natural order is to live; to go against it is to die.

<p>To treat the five labors and six extremes, and the injuries that result in emptiness, we consider five labors related to the five organs and six extremes related to the six bowels. The seven injuries originate from internal and external afflictions. The five labors are: first, labor of will; second, labor of thought; third, labor of worry; fourth, labor of the heart; fifth, labor of exhaustion. The six extremes are: first, extreme of qi; second, extreme of blood; third, extreme of tendons; fourth, extreme of bones; fifth, extreme of marrow; sixth, extreme of essence. The seven injuries are: first, liver injury causes vivid dreams; second, heart injury leads to forgetfulness; third, spleen injury encourages excessive drinking; fourth, lung injury causes weakness; fifth, kidney injury leads to excessive salivation; sixth, bone injury induces hunger; seventh, pulse injury leads to coughing. </p>
<p>In general, excessive pondering and strong thinking harm people; worry and anger harm people; excessive joy and merriment harm people; unresolved anger harms people; relentless desires harm people; constant concerns harm people; cold and excessive stimulation harm people. Therefore, the five labors, six extremes, and seven injuries are mentioned.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment of Diseases of Exhaustion</h3>
<p>In discussing the diseases of exhaustion, one must note that the condition known as labor disease is a major affliction for humanity. Those who suffer from this illness experience a variety of symptoms, and over the course of many years, it can lead to severe consequences, even devastating families, which is truly lamentable! Generally speaking, it can be categorized as transmission of the corpse; specifically, it may refer to conditions such as bone steaming, corpse gas, repeated attacks, corpse exhaustion, labor exhaustion, gu disease, toxin disease, heat exhaustion, cold exhaustion, food disease, and ghostly disease. The term &quot;exhaustion&quot; signifies a blockage that inhibits healing, where the source of the illness remains unchanged. This is known as exhaustion. Furthermore, there are twenty-two variations, or even thirty-six, or ninety-nine forms of this disease. </p>
<p>There exist what are known as the five corpses: namely, flying corpse, fleeing corpse, cold corpse, lost corpse, and corpse blockage. While their names differ, their transmission and variations are likewise distinct. Those who succumb to this disease and find peace are exceedingly rare. Generally, illnesses arising from the five viscera provoke symptoms of aversion to cold and fever, each presenting differently: </p>
<ul>
<li>When the liver is affected, symptoms include a pale face, dry eyes, bitterness in the mouth, and spontaneous sweating, along with anxiety and unrest.</li>
<li>When the heart is involved, symptoms manifest as a dark face, dry nose, mouth sores, forgetfulness, and either constipation or diarrhea.</li>
<li>If the spleen is the source, one may see a bluish face, yellow lips, a stiff tongue, a choking throat, excessive salivation, thinness, and lack of appetite.</li>
<li>In cases where the lungs are affected, symptoms may include a red face, pale nose, sputum mixed with blood, and severe cough.</li>
<li>When the kidneys are involved, one might observe a yellow face, dry ears, chest fullness, pain in the thighs, and cloudy discharges.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also twenty-four types of labor-renewing conditions that can be identified through examination.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>When there is steaming in the heart, one feels a lack of energy and is troubled; the tongue must be scorched and black. When it steams in the small intestine, there is thunder in the abdomen, and the large intestine may either withhold or release. When it steams in the liver, the eyes grow dim and dizzy, and one is irritable without cause. When it steams in the gallbladder, there is deafness and a bitter taste in the mouth, with hardness and pain below the ribs. When it steams in the kidneys, the ears become dry and shriveled, and there is soreness in the waist and legs. When it steams in the right kidney, emotions become unstable, and there is leakage of white fluid. When it steams in the lungs, there is wheezing with blood cough, and the voice is hoarse and distant. When it steams in the large intestine, the right nostril is dry and painful, and there are hidden aches in the large intestine. When it steams in the spleen, the lips and mouth are dry, the abdomen and sides are bloated, and there is aversion to cold and loss of appetite. When it steams in the stomach, both the nose and mouth are dry, the abdomen swells with sweating, and sleep is restless. When it steams in the bladder, the urine is yellow and red, thick and turbid like paste.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The steaming occurs in the San Jiao, sometimes cold, sometimes hot, causing discomfort in the middle of the abdomen; when it occurs in the diaphragm, there is a sensation of blockage in the chest, resulting in painful discomfort; when it occurs in the zong tendon, the tendons and vessels are slack, accompanied by dull pain in the lower abdomen and a sense of heaviness in the genitals; when it occurs in the lower intestine, there is constipation and urgency at the anus, often feeling discomfort before and heaviness afterward; when it occurs in the jade chamber, men have seminal emission and women experience excessive vaginal discharge; when it occurs in the brain, there is blurred vision, dizziness, and a production of foul saliva from the mouth; when it occurs in the skin, the skin becomes rough and the hair brittle and dark; when it occurs in the bones, the teeth decay, are black, and there is a sour pain in the shoulder; when it occurs in the marrow, there is soreness and fatigue in the shoulders and back, and pain in the joints; when it occurs in the tendons, there is dim vision, side pain, and brittle nails; when it occurs in the vessels, there is irritability, body heat, and sharp stabbing pains; when it occurs internally, there is a subjective feeling of heat in the body, often resulting in involuntary movements of the limbs; when it occurs in the blood, there is brittle hair, and sometimes nosebleeds, or blood in the urine. The details of all these symptoms are generally as stated. If one seeks the root cause, it is primarily due to the heart and lungs being gnawed by parasites, a grave misfortune. The treatment should first focus on eliminating the root cause, then on nourishing and adjusting the body; there are also cases where early moxibustion at the Huan Tiao and Cui Shi points has led to recovery. However, if one waits until the condition has deeply entrenched before attempting treatment, it will be too late.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Five Exhaustions and Six Extremes</strong></p>
<p>The medical texts record the symptoms of the five exhaustions and six extremes, which are not merely attributed to the lingering effects of physical labor, but largely arise from failure to maintain health, overexertion, opposition to yin and yang, and damage to nourishment and protection; thus leading to the diseases of the five exhaustions and six extremes. The labor from physical work and worry manifests as liver exhaustion, which corresponds to muscular extremes; the mental strain from excessive thinking leads to heart exhaustion, corresponding to arterial extremes; overthinking due to unexpected concerns results in spleen exhaustion, corresponding to flesh extremes; anxiety about future matters causes lung exhaustion, corresponding to qi extremes; and holding onto ambitions and principles leads to kidney exhaustion, corresponding to bone extremes. These five exhaustions correspond to the five extremes.</p>
<p>However, in states of extreme exhaustion, the energies of the five organs and six viscera decline, the body becomes depleted, vision blurs, teeth decay and hair falls out, the body feels heavy and hearing diminishes, movement becomes unsteady, and evil qi disrupts the six viscera and oppresses the five organs, resulting in extreme depletion. Generally speaking, the pulse in cases of extreme exhaustion is often wiry. The treatment methods should adjust according to their excess or deficiency, heat or cold. For those in a state of extreme depletion, one should replenish their essence. As stated in the &quot;Suwen&quot;: &quot;For those lacking in form, warm them with qi; for those lacking in essence, replenish them with flavors.&quot; Roughly speaking, this summarizes the approach.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>On the Diseases of Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>The disease of deficiency arises when cold and heat affect the body due to this deficiency. When cold is felt, it damages yang; when yang is deficient, yin becomes excessive, leading to loss from above downwards. For treatment, one should use warm, sweet, and mild remedies; if the treatment goes too far, it cannot restore the stomach. When heat is felt, it damages yin; when yin is deficient, yang becomes excessive, thus leading to loss from below upwards. For treatment, one should use bitter, sour, and salty remedies; if the treatment goes too far, it cannot restore the spleen.</p>
<p>Loss from above entails: first, loss in the lungs, leading to skin aggregation and hair loss; second, loss in the heart, causing a deficiency in blood vessels and an inability to nourish the organs, resulting in menstrual issues for women; third, loss in the stomach, where food fails to nourish the skin. Loss from below entails: first, loss in the kidneys, leading to weakness and inability to rise from bed; second, loss in the liver, causing the tendons to weaken and lose their grip; third, loss in the spleen, leading to an inability to digest and assimilate food. </p>
<p>It is said that when the heart and lungs are damaged, complexion darkens; when the kidneys and liver are damaged, physical strength declines; when grains cannot be transformed, the spleen is distraught. All those suffering from these ailments experience a state of deficiency. The more deeply entrenched these issues become, the more they represent a chronic fatigue syndrome.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>East Garden Ten Books</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Li Gao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Weakness of the Spleen and Stomach and the Remedies for Various Illnesses</strong>  </p>
<p>The weakness of the spleen and stomach is caused by insufficient energy in the upper body. When encountering the hot weather in summer, it harms the original qi, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down, with limbs feeling weak, and the spirit lacking vitality. The feet become weak and soft. In the face of cold mornings and evenings, after the sun has risen high, yang energy begins to flourish, causing a heat that feels like fire; thus, both yin and yang, qi and blood are deficient. Consequently, one may experience heat collapse due to yin deficiency or cold collapse due to qi deficiency. One&#39;s mouth loses the sense of taste, and one feels fiery in the eyes but sees nothing. Urination becomes frequent, while bowel movements become difficult and constipated. Pain emerges in the stomach and heart, the sides may hurt or feel tightly constricted, and the area beneath the navel feels like being bound by ropes, sometimes as sharp as being stabbed. The abdomen becomes hard and difficult to move, the chest feels closed, and one may occasionally experience nausea or cough with phlegm, saliva foams in the mouth, and there is pain in the tongue, lower back, shoulders, and eyes. Headaches occur intermittently, appetite is lost, sometimes even just a small amount of food consumed feels filling, and there is a complete lack of desire for food, often with excessive sweating. If the yin energy returns to the skin, it is due to the heat of the weather aggravating the condition; thus, the metal of the large intestine and the lungs suffer under this heat. The first step is to support the original qi and address the deficiency of the metal elements; the Decoction of Astragalus and Ginseng is the principal remedy for this.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>On the Inadvisability of Using Vomiting Remedies for Spleen and Stomach Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p>The discussion in &quot;Liu Yuan Zheng Ji&quot; states that when wood is stagnant, it should be released; the nature of wood is to be dynamic and elevated. If it is now trapped underground with no outlet, it is akin to wind losing its land. For individuals with the signs of wood stagnation in their bodies, they should be opened up, and one may use methods of vomiting to assist the movement of wood; this embodies the idea of releasing wood stagnation. Furthermore, when wood is released, it signifies that wood has initially lost its nature and been trapped underground, but now, having been opened, it moves towards the heavens, thus it is released and no longer stagnant — wood returns to its nature and becomes excessive. When there is excess, it also includes what it overcomes; the spleen&#39;s earth receives evils, which can be observed in the context of wood stagnation. This is not the only indication. Moreover, the Jueyin, which governs the heavens, is also characterized by strong wind and wood. The triumph of Jueyin is also the strength of wind and wood, both signify that the spleen and stomach are affected, as seen in the previous context, where the discussion is consistent. Some may not comprehend the meaning of &quot;wood stagnation release&quot; and mistakenly treat wood stagnation as a condition needing to be addressed, heavily emphasizing substance, which further subjects the spleen and stomach to the control of wood, effectively replenishing what is excessive while neglecting what is deficient.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The energy of the spleen and stomach is already insufficient; how can one not be greatly injured by this? Furthermore, the chest is filled with obstruction, and one must vomit. The gas at the mouth is three times larger than the pulse at the wrist. This indicates food injury to the Taiyin, with pulses above but absent below. If one does not vomit, death is imminent. Since there is no pulse below, it is clear that the wood is congested below, causing the pathways to be blocked and the liver energy to be cut off. The lung metal also obstructs and does not descend, blocked by material. Metal can overcome wood. The liver wood is affected by evil, food obstructs the chest and throat, hence it is said that those below are affected and thus surpassed. Zhang Zhongjing states: to relieve this distress, one should use gourd vine seeds to help induce vomiting. Just as sweating and purging in the classics is referred to as vacuous distress, it is also called vexation. With restlessness and inability to sleep, it indicates wood congestion, which can be treated with Gardenia and fried soybeans soup to induce vomiting. Those in confusion will find their throat blocked, both sides of the chest supporting a distended and insufficient stomach; then, with turbid energy above, one suffers from distension, leading to vomiting. Moreover, if the stomach is weak, it will inevitably become angry. Wind wood has come to invade the stomach, and the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions iron and drops to settle it. How can one reverse and vomit to aid the evil of wind wood? If one does not focus on vomiting but does so, the difference is as disparate as the separation of heaven and earth. Generally, in cases where the chest is congested and there is continuous vexation, one should indeed induce vomiting.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The Spleen and Stomach Deficiency: A Discussion on the Nine Openings</p>
<p>True Qi, also known as Yuan Qi, is the essence and energy produced in the initial form. It cannot be nourished without Stomach Qi. Stomach Qi encompasses grain Qi, nourishing Qi, transporting Qi, life Qi, clear Qi, defensive Qi, and Yang Qi. Furthermore, there is Heavenly Qi, Human Qi, and Earth Qi, which are the energies of the Three Jiao. Although they are described separately, they are essentially one and should not be regarded as different names or concepts.</p>
<p>When dietary intake and labor are excessive, one may experience spontaneous sweating and frequent urination. Yin fire then overcomes the position of Earth, clear Qi fails to arise, and the Yang pathway does not function. Consequently, Yin blood collides with fire, creating conditions where the Yangming Stomach Earth is dry on the right and hot on the left, leading to the transformation of dryness into fire, causing fluids to fail to remain.</p>
<p>Moreover, both urination and sweating result in a loss of fluids. When fluids reach the lower palace, they transform into blood. The pulse is the cavity of the blood; if blood is depleted, from where can the seven spirits depend? All pulses transform from this center. Among the myriad of diseases faced by humans, none are greater than wind stroke.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>When there is sweat, the wind pathogen invades; when there is no sweat, the yang energy is firm and dense, the pores are closed off, and various pathogens cannot harm. It is said that if yang cannot conquer its yin, then the qi of the five viscera conflicts, and the nine orifices are not open; if the spleen is insufficient, it causes blockage of the nine orifices, which is called heaviness; if the five viscera are in disharmony, the nine orifices do not open. Additionally, headaches and tinnitus, along with blocked orifices, arise from the conditions of the intestines and stomach. </p>
<p>Let us analyze and clarify: The spleen is the yin earth, the ultimate yin energy, which rules stillness and inertia. The stomach is the yang earth, which is active and never ceases. The yang energy resides underground, and thus it can generate and transform all things; hence, the five movements are above and the six qi are below. The spleen extends one foot, covering the greater warehouse (the upper mouth of the stomach). The spleen receives the essence from the stomach, which enables it to ferment and mature the grains. The stomach is the source of the twelve meridians, the sea of food and water; when in harmony, all transformations are peaceful, but when diseased, all transformations are perilous.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The energies of the five organs connect upwards to the nine orifices. The five organs receive energy from the six bowels, and the six bowels derive energy from the stomach. The six bowels correspond to the influences of wind, cold, heat, moisture, dryness, and fire from the heavens; these are formless energies. When the stomach energy is balanced, nourishing energy rises, generating warmth, which corresponds to spring and summer. When the yang travels at twenty-five degrees, the peak of yang disperses, and as it descends, yin is generated. When yin descends, it corresponds to autumn and winter, and the pathway of yin represents coldness. If the stomach suffers from illness and cannot nourish, the energies of the six bowels are cut off, resulting in a disruption of the yang pathway, with the yin fire rising. The energies of the five organs, each influenced by a bowel&#39;s transformation, can then nourish the skin, blood vessels, bones, and tendons. Thus, when we say that the energies of the five organs are severed externally, it means that the energy production of the six bowels has first ceased, leading to the five organs being unable to receive energy and subsequently exhausting their energy. The lungs, which originally gather and descend, also govern the five energies; when energy is exhausted, it flows downward and mixes with the spleen&#39;s earth in the lower regions, thus it is said to be burdened. When the stomach’s energy is diseased, it then drips downward.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The scriptures say: Moisture is received from below, and the spleen is the ultimate yin, rooted in the earth. The solid earth fills the source of the nine orifices below; it cannot ascend to communicate with heaven. Therefore, it is said that when the five organs are unharmonious, the nine orifices do not function properly. The stomach carries clear qi upward, which represents the yang energy of the earth. Accumulated yang forms heaven; this is why the clear yang ascends through the upper orifices, enriches the four limbs, and invigorates the skin and pores. Since the spleen and stomach are overwhelmed by yin fire, the energy of grains becomes blocked and flows downwards, causing the clear qi to fail in its ascent, thus disrupting the nine orifices. If there is illness in the stomach, then the original qi of all twelve channels is deficient. When qi is scarce, fluids do not circulate, and a lack of fluids leads to deficient blood; hence, the sinews, bones, skin, flesh, and vessels all become weak. Thus, both qi and blood are enfeebled. Is it not necessary to be cautious with labor, movement, and dietary intake? Anyone suffering from this illness, even without changing to other maladies, has already diminished their lifespan; and if compounded by improper acupuncture or medication, how can they avoid an early demise?<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>When the spleen and stomach are weak, the qi of the organs and meridians cannot receive it, leading them to all suffer. </p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach are deficient, the dampness and earth qi accumulate below the navel, affecting the kidneys and bladder. The bladder governs cold, while the kidneys contain yin fire, and both are weakened, preventing the nourishing qi from circulating. The large intestine, associated with the metal element, governs dryness and fluids; the small intestine, associated with the fire element, governs liquid and warmth. Both are related to the stomach, which, when weak, cannot receive qi and thus becomes deficient, leading to a lack of fluids, resulting in dry mouth and throat while sleeping, and skin that lacks moisture.</p>
<p>The liver governs wind and warmth, and is responsible for generating and transforming blood and qi throughout the body; the small intestine, associated with heat, governs the nourishment of yang qi in the body. They also draw qi from the stomach, allowing them to disperse and rise effectively.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>When the stomach is deficient, the gallbladder and the small intestine lack the warmth and growth energy, which remains trapped within the physical blood vessels, leading to heat illnesses and strokes. The manifestations of this illness are countless, causing stagnation in the five organs: liver (green), heart (red), spleen (yellow), lungs (white), and kidneys (black). The sanjiao, or &quot;three burnings,&quot; serves as the root for the generation of original qi in the lower jiao, acting as a fire vessel; hence the energy of all six fu organs is weakened. </p>
<p>The &quot;fu&quot; refers to the storages that contain the five viscera and the physical substances. Moreover, the energy of the six fu has no external master but receives internal influences, as it is affected by the heavenly wind to produce the gallbladder, by the summer heat to produce the small intestine, by dampness to produce the stomach, by dryness to produce the large intestine, by cold to produce the bladder, and by the qi of heavenly unity to produce the three burnings. This represents the paternal qi, which is formless. </p>
<p>Wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire are merely different names for the distinctions of warmth, heat, cold, and coolness. The movement of yang is influenced by a temperature of twenty-five degrees, causing a rightward migration and fluctuation between ascension and descension. This deficiency is primarily due to the weakness of the spleen and stomach. In terms of the five organs, if heart fire is excessive and invades the spleen earth, it leads to internal heat, with a full and large pulse and feelings of restlessness.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: If there is movement of qi at the navel in cases of spleen illness, pressing it will feel firm and painful, like something solid and hard, resembling a mass, and if pain is severe, it can be quite intense. If this phenomenon is present, it indicates spleen deficiency; if not, it does not. Additionally, if one experiences fatigue after eating, and their spirit feels foggy and drowsy, it signifies weakness of the spleen. Moreover, if heart fire is intense, shifting into the liver wood, combined with wind and dampness, there can be pain throughout the body, with a pulse that is large and wiry, at times slack, which may cause dizziness or numbness. All these indicate wind. Spleen illnesses manifest as heaviness and joint pain, as painful obstruction, cold obstruction, various damp obstructions, weakness and loss of strength, and large boils and sores. If pungent and heating substances are used to aid pathogens, it leads to heat illness and stroke, and the transformations are numerous and complex.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>When the wood element is strong, it operates in the northern regions, and when it is improperly aligned, it supports the water in the kidneys. This water, when supported by offspring, enters the spleen as phlegm, flows into saliva, enters the liver as tears, enters the lungs as nasal mucus, and, riding on the liver&#39;s wood, counteracts the spleen&#39;s earth, making it clear. </p>
<p>One must first nourish the yin aspect and supplement the yang energy, allowing it to rise and travel along the yang pathways, utilizing the empty orifices. Then, add herbs that cool the water, suppressing the yin fire, such as Coptis and Rhizoma. First, supplement the yang, then drain the yin; when both the spleen and stomach are strong and return to their proper position in the middle jiao, the yin and yang energies will be balanced. </p>
<p>Fire is said to rise, and water to nourish downwards. The kidneys govern the five fluids, which emerge upwards from the orifices in the head, causing tears, nasal mucus, sweat, and saliva. Why does this happen? It is said that in cases of illness, there is frothy saliva from the mouth, cold sweat from the body, and clear nasal mucus from the nose, all of which result from the ascendancy of evils from the yang and yin meridians, as well as from the Du and Chong vessels, overwhelming the kidney water, leading to this upward boiling. </p>
<p>This peculiar evil causes illness and is not restrained by the five elements or the yin-yang of the twelve meridians; it should instead be treated through the peculiar evils associated with the Du and Chong meridians and their respective points.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>On the Conditions Arising from Qi Deficiency and Weakness of the Stomach</strong></p>
<p>Both diet and labor lead to sweating, which transforms the yangming (yang brightness) and generates dry heat. Thus, fluids cannot be retained, resulting in frequent sweating and urination. Among the many afflictions, none is worse than apoplexy (stroke). Wind is the chief of all diseases, capable of swift and numerous changes. However, without a deficiency of vital energy, wind, rain, and cold cannot independently harm a person; one must first be enfeebled by a deficiency, allowing disruptive forces to invade. Conditions such as atrophy and counterflow arise from excessive sweating. Moreover, during winter, the yang energy is hidden beneath the waters and earth. If one should excessively lose essence, then how can yang energy be garnered in spring? All transformation would be lost. In humans, food and labor lead to sweating, and when this occurs frequently, various diseases arise. The reason I emphasize this is to encourage people to be cautious.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Law</strong><br><strong>(Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Labour Chai</strong>  </p>
<p>Labour Chai is primarily caused by yin deficiency, phlegm, and blood diseases.<br>Xu Lao (Qi deficiency) leads to gradual weight loss associated with fire; when yin fire depletes due to accumulated heat, one can initially use the method of combining with children. Later, if emaciation occurs, the Four Substance Decoction can be adjusted and combined with Sanxia Pill to expel accumulated heat. One should avoid excessive yang deficiency that leads to overheating; chronic illnesses can be severe. The Four Substance Decoction for labour diseases should include fried Atractylodes, bamboo sap, human urine, and ginger juice, which provide significant nourishment. Those with severe heat and muscle loss are difficult to treat.  </p>
<p>The symptoms of Labour Chai are not just one aspect. Initially, they arise from weakened vitality and injuries to the heart and kidneys. Since the heart governs blood and the kidneys govern essence, the depletion of essence and dryness of blood leads to Labour sickness. Thus, the transmission varies: bone steaming, feebleness, recurrence, and pestilence. Pestilence refers to affliction, transmitting from above to below, affecting bones and flesh, with cases resulting in family demise. Symptoms may involve insects gnawing at the heart and lungs, known as Chai Disease, which is difficult to treat.  </p>
<p>For transmitted corpse Labour Chai, with alternating cold and heat, prolonged cough with blood sputum, and gradual emaciation, start treatment with either the Sanmiao Decoction or the Lotus Heart Powder, which should not fail in cases.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In &quot;Ge Ke Jiu Lao Zheng Shi Yao Shen Shu,&quot; seven formulas are extracted. </p>
<p>The life of a person is nourished by the ethereal energies of heaven and earth, depending on the cultivation of true essence to solidify its foundation; thus, diseases will not arise, and the body will remain healthy. If one does not nurture the true essence and does not solidify the foundation, diseases will therefore develop. The true essence’s foundation consists of qi, blood, and vital fluids. I once heard my esteemed teacher say: &quot;Among all illnesses, those caused by overexertion are the most difficult to treat.&quot; This is because overexertion occurs when a person, in the vigor of youth with accumulated qi and plentiful vital fluids, fails to preserve life. Indulgence in pleasures like alcohol and lust leads to relentless pursuits day and night without rest, resulting in the exhaustion of true essence and the depletion of vital fluids. This can lead to symptoms such as vomiting blood, coughing phlegm, feverish bones and body, kidney deficiency, exhaustion of essence, a pale face with red cheeks, dry mouth and throat, unusual seminal discharge, night sweats, and difficulty in eating, with total loss of strength, which is termed as &quot;fire flourishing and metal declining.&quot; In severe cases, it can lead to death within six months; in lighter cases, within a year. Furthermore, if physicians do not investigate the source and do not understand its foundation, some may prescribe extremely cold or extremely hot medicines, blindly treating the illness with no effective results. They do not realize that extreme cold only worsens the inner deficiency, and extreme heat exhausts the inner resources, thus in the world of medicine, there is hardly anyone capable of treating overexertion. My teacher’s method of treating overexertion with medicines was like the archer Yi, whose shots never missed. Now, I will outline the sequence of using medicines. The method of administering medicine is as follows: For those who vomit or cough up blood, first use the Ten Ash Powder to halt the condition; if the situation is serious, it is necessary to use the Flower and Stamen Stone Powder to stop it.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Generally, if the blood is hot, it flows; if it is cold, it congeals. Upon seeing black, one must stop, as this is the natural order. After stopping the bleeding, the person will be exhausted. Next, use Donshen Decoction to replenish, allowing them to sleep soundly without disturbance; upon waking, their illness will be reduced by fifty to sixty percent, after which they may take other medicines. </p>
<p>Baohé Decoction stops coughing and soothes the lungs. Baozhen Decoction replenishes deficiency and removes heat. Taiping Pill moistens the lungs and alleviates weakness. Xiaohua Pill expels phlegm and resolves qi. </p>
<p>In Baohé Decoction, categorize internally the six conditions of excessive blood, phlegm, dyspnea, heat, wind, and cold, and blend accordingly. In Baozhen Decoction, categorize internally the six conditions of shock, turbid urination, constipation, nocturnal emissions, dryness and heat, and night sweats, and use the recipe accordingly. No additional ingredients should be added.</p>
<p>For taking medicine, each day brew a strong peppermint decoction and gargle with it. Chew a Taiping Pill first and swallow it slowly; then hold another pill in the mouth and let it dissolve gradually; do this before going to bed. At night, as the lung orifices open, the medicine must flow into these orifices. This method is crucial. If phlegm is obstructing, first mix a hundred Xiaohua Pills with honey and swallow them, then proceed to chew and hold Taiping Pills as before, allowing the person to lie on their back and sleep. </p>
<p>After taking the previous seven medicines, if there is coughing from the lungs, one can cook and consume润肺丸 (润肺丸) as usual. Before the seven medicines, if there is time, also prepare this and take Baifeng Paste to secure the root and complete the foundation. Only after the illness can one consider taking Shizhen Pill, which serves as a marvelous remedy for revitalizing strength.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Exhaustions</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Five Exhaustions&quot; refer to the labors of the five viscera. They all arise from overstraining one&#39;s capabilities, excessive worry and thought, indulgence in drinking without restraint, or imbalances caused by illness, which can accumulate over time into exhaustion. Symptoms include dizziness, eye discomfort, body pain, weakness in the limbs, palpitations, shortness of breath, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, chills and fever, persistent heat in the palms, fluctuating heat sensations, bone heat, frequent nightmares, lethargy during the day, tinnitus, a bitter taste in the mouth, and reduced appetite — all of which indicate injury from exhaustion. While all five viscera can be exhausted, the heart and kidneys are particularly affected. The heart governs blood, and the kidneys govern essence; if essence is depleted and blood is dry, exhaustion arises. </p>
<p>The treatment for exhaustion should prioritize nourishing the heart and supporting the kidneys. Harsh and potent substances should not be used, as a gentle and nurturing approach is preferred for long-lasting effects. Overuse of strong substances like Tianxiong (astragalus) and Fuzi (aconite) can easily activate their yang, as there is insufficient essence and blood to handle such forceful treatments. One must not rely solely on sweet and cooling medicines in the presence of heat, as this can damage kidney qi. Using only hot medicines is akin to adding fire without water in a cauldron; excessive cold medicines is like adding water without fire beneath. This approach not only lacks benefit but can be harmful.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>It is advisable to use the Ten Complete Nourishing Decoction, or the Shuanghe Powder, the Yangrong Decoction, the Seven Treasures Powder, and the Lejing Jianzhong Decoction, any of which may be selected. One may occasionally take the Shuangbu Pill. If there is unexplained physical weakness, extreme fatigue, and no other symptoms, this is likely due to excessive labor leading to deficient blood and qi, thus one should use the Jieblao Powder or the Heqi Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Angelica. Additionally, excessive speaking and reciting can exhaust one&#39;s spirit, resulting in deficiency, which can lead to loss of voice. In such cases, the Ten Complete Nourishing Decoction and similar remedies should be chosen. </p>
<p>For elderly individuals suffering from illness, if suddenly their ability to speak is lost and they do not respond when called, this is not due to &quot;mute wind.&quot; After some time, with the effects of medicine, nourishment, and adjustment, they will regain their ability to respond. </p>
<p>People with qi deficiency often have trouble sleeping. If there is excessive phlegm with hidden dampness in the gallbladder leading to an inability to sleep, one should not resort to general treatments for deficiency, as inappropriate tonification may worsen the phlegm. </p>
<p>If someone, while seated or lying down, wishes to be pressed or kneaded to find comfort, this too indicates deficiency. For those suffering from fevers or alternating chills and fever, each has been previously addressed; one should confirm if these are due to deficiency from labor and appropriate remedies should be used. If not effective, the Fourteen Flavor Jianzhong Decoction may be used. For those thirsty and unable to tolerate heat remedies, the Seven Treasures Powder with added Mu Xiang and Wu Wei Zi, each at seven grams, is recommended. If there is excessive heat, the Huangqi Biejia Powder or the Ren Shen Powder may be used. For those with a sensation of heat in the palms, indicating a potential onset of deficiency, the Fuling Bu Xin Decoction is appropriate.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>Although the outside may be scorching, the inside fears the cold. In midsummer, one cannot wear only a single layer of clothing. Take Da Jian Zhong Decoction, Shi Si Wei Jian Zhong Decoction, Zheng Yuan Drink, and Shen Fu Decoction. If one has a reduced appetite and fears food causing nausea, it is difficult to rely solely on sweet remedies; it is necessary to carefully consider using remedies that invigorate the spleen, while not neglecting ingredients like powdered sand and dried tangerine peel. If the Jian Zhong Decoction contains dried tangerine peel, Ban Xia, and Fili, it can be used, and deer antler and tangerine peel should be decocted into balls. If there is no nausea and one does not fear food, remedies like Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction and Shuang He San should also have the invigorating spleen ingredients added as a precaution.</p>
<p>For those suffering from insufficient essence and blood, knowing they need to nourish the kidneys, they often desire to seek out herbs like Gui Qi, but if their appetite is already diminished, it may not be beneficial for the spleen. If they wish to harmonize the spleen&#39;s energy, they inevitably must use dispersing remedies, which may further deplete kidney water. Achieving both goals in one move is best accomplished with deer antler and tangerine peel decocted into balls. Thus it is said that to nourish insufficient essence through flavor is wise, and that nourishing the kidneys is not as effective as nourishing the spleen, for the spleen connects above to the heart and below to the kidneys. The Daoist concept of harmonizing the heart and kidneys, with the spleen as the intermediary, reflects this idea. However, if the kidney essence is significantly depleted and the condition is severe, the kidneys cannot tolerate any delay, thus one should not be bound strictly by these theories.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>To know about nourishing the kidneys, it should be assisted with ingredients like cardamom and clear gourd. For strengthening the spleen, one should combine it with northern five-flavored herbs and astragalus. Diagnosis and prescribing medication should adapt according to the circumstances of the illness. </p>
<p>If someone has been laboring for a long time and coughs up blood, with a sore throat but no sound, this indicates a disease that transmits upward from the lower body; if there is no cough or pain but after a long time they experience cloudy urine and semen loss, this signifies a disease that transmits downward from the upper body. Both are signs of imminent death.</p>
<p>If the face appears normal, the body feels plump, and outwardly looks healthy but is actually internally weak and deficient, this is commonly referred to as &quot;peach blossom decay.&quot; One should observe which symptoms are present and use the appropriate medicine accordingly.</p>
<p>There are instances of contagious fatigue that can spread among family members and even cause whole families to perish. This indicates that laboring pests exist in all five internal organs, termed as consumption disease, which is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Outward symptoms may arise from strenuous activities, chills, fevers, body aches, shortness of breath, or extreme fatigue with a desire to sleep. This is a temporary condition and should not be confused with the five types of exhaustion; it is advisable to use soothing herbal drinks.</p>
<p>In cases of severe coughing with much phlegm, it is called labor cough, which differs from coughs due to wind-cold obstruction and heat. This has a root and a branch; the root is in the kidneys, while the branch is in the lungs. The previous method can be applied, adding five flavors, apricot kernels, seasonal gelatin, and fritillaria, among other ingredients. For those who cough and wheeze, one should add more agarwood to the previous medication and still take spirit sand pills or the triple-fried pills.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Lao Zhai</strong></p>
<p>In men around the age of twenty, excessive sexual desire can damage vital essences and blood, leading to the condition known as &quot;Lao Zhai&quot; (wasting disease) characterized by deficiency of yin and the activation of internal heat. Symptoms include night sweats during sleep, afternoon fever, persistent coughing, fatigue, low appetite, and in severe cases, phlegm with blood, coughing up blood, or nasal bleeding. The body temperature rises, the pulse becomes deep and rapid, and the muscles visibly waste away. This condition is particularly difficult to treat; in mild cases, numerous doses of medicine are required, while in severe cases, a longer duration of treatment spanning years may be necessary. However, it is crucial for patients to value their lives, cultivate a determined mindset, avoid sexual activities, cease idle thoughts, restrain anger, and regulate their diet to nurture their health. Otherwise, even with good medicine, healing will be ineffective. Early treatment of this condition is easier; once the body shows significant muscle wasting, prolonged fatigue, and a deeply hidden, rapid pulse, it becomes challenging to address. Furthermore, patients must strictly avoid ginseng; those who have previously overused it will find their condition even more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Now I present a prescription for treating conditions stemming from excessive sexual desire, particularly when symptoms include tidal heat, night sweats, cough, and fatigue. Early use of this remedy is advised: </p>
<ul>
<li>5 grams of raw Rehmannia washed with wine,</li>
<li>5 grams of prepared licorice,</li>
<li>5 grams of dry ginger,</li>
<li>10 grams each of Chuanxiong, cooked Rehmannia, and prepared Solomon&#39;s seal,</li>
<li>3.3 grams each of white peony and angelica,</li>
<li>7 grams each of dried tangerine peel and yellow bitter herb,</li>
<li>3 slices of fresh ginger,</li>
</ul>
<p>All boiled in water and taken warm on an empty stomach. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above prescription is designed to address conditions of excessive heat and yin deficiency.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>This condition generally corresponds to the deficiency of the three yin, characterized by a lack of true heat and the absence of fire, which is why it manifests during the day and subsides at night, or vice versa, occurring at irregular times. The primary treatment should be the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to tonify; additionally, the Bao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be used to nourish the spleen and stomach. If there is prior damage to the spleen and stomach, the Bao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should take precedence, while the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill is used to warm and preserve the liver and kidneys, often leading to recovery. However, if herbs like Huangbo or Zhimu are incorrectly employed, they can further harm the spleen and stomach, resulting in reduced appetite, increasingly weak organs, sinking of the vital energy, abdominal distention, and diarrhea, which would be beyond recovery. </p>
<p>As for nosebleeds and vomiting of blood, these arise from the reckless movement of false heat due to deficiency, leading the blood to flow erratically with the heat, or due to a deficiency of Yang energy which cannot restrain the blood, causing it to go astray. The pulse would be wiry and rapid, indicative of a rootless fire floating externally.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>Generally, this condition arises mostly during the months of April, May, and June when the fire and earth are in great abundance, while metal and water are diminished. At such times, one should not rely solely on bland tastes, but rather nourish the two vital organs. In the months of November and December, the fire energy lies dormant and doesn’t far from the curtain; it harms the true essence. Thus, by late spring and early summer, one may suffer from headaches, weak limbs, little appetite, and body heat, which are symptoms of summer ailments. Some may exhibit signs of aging, intolerance to cold and heat, and inability to endure labor, experiencing recurring illnesses throughout the four seasons. This is all due to the qi and blood being insufficient, leading to mental fatigue. Additionally, if the essence and blood are not fully nourished, they may decline too early, making symptoms difficult to characterize. If the left wrist pulse is weak or thin and rapid, it indicates insufficient true yin of the left kidney, so one should use the Six Flavor Pill. If the right wrist pulse is slow, soft, or heavy and thin, with a tendency to fade, it indicates insufficient fire of the mingmen, so one should use the Eight Flavor Pill. If both wrists feel weak, it indicates deficiency in both yin and yang, so the Ten Nourishing Pill should be used. These remedies are all to nourish the source of transformation. One should also refer to the treatment methods for prior fevers and subsequent coughs.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Medicine&#39;s True Transmission</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Yu Tuan)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Deficiency and Loss</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked: For the disease of deficiency and loss, it is common in the world to use the &quot;Jufang&quot; formula, the Ten Complete Great Tonic Decoction, to replenish it. This formula is indeed a key to various deficiencies. It uses ginseng, astragalus, poria, atractylodes, and licorice to replenish qi deficiency, and angelica, chuanxiong, peony, rehmannia, and cinnamon to replenish blood deficiency. How would you discuss this, dear scholar? I replied: This medicine is meant for both qi and blood deficiency. If one has blood deficiency but sufficient qi, or qi deficiency but sufficient blood, can it be applied uniformly? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states, poisonous medicines treat violent diseases. Every medicine has the potential to be toxic; however, those who are ill can leverage this potential for recovery, while those who are not ill merely invite its toxicity, worsening their condition. For cases of both heart and spleen deficiency, one should use poria to replenish. If one is deficient without sweating and has reduced urination, taking it will be beneficial; if one is deficient but has frequent urination, excessive consumption may lead to blindness; if one is deficient and excessively sweats, long-term use will damage qi and shorten life, because of its bland taste and diuretic properties. Also, for those with weak lung qi and deficient yang, one should use astragalus to replenish. However, for those who are plump and pale with qi deficiency and excessive sweating, taking it will be beneficial.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>If a person has ample kidney energy but is not extremely deficient, taking it will surely cause fullness and unease, due to its cold nature and its ability to constrict qi. Licorice is a good remedy for strengthening the spleen, nourishing the center, and clearing fire to alleviate restlessness; however, for those who vomit frequently or are bloated and have a penchant for alcohol, excessive use can lead to retention of qi and worsen vomiting and bloat, because of its sweet and mild nature. Chuanxiong is a supreme herb for nourishing blood, promoting circulation, and clearing the head, yet for those who experience bone heat and profuse sweating or have weak qi, prolonged use will scatter true qi and exacerbate yin deficiency, due to its pungent and dispersing properties. Fresh Rehmannia can generate blood and benefit the veins; however, those suffering from weak qi or have an aversion to cold should be cautious as it may harm the stomach and reduce appetite. Cooked Rehmannia nourishes and supplements blood; yet, for those with excess phlegm-fire, there is concern it may obstruct the diaphragm. Ginseng is a remedy for moistening the lungs and strengthening the spleen; if one&#39;s original qi is deficient, it is indispensable. However, for those with a chronic cough, laborious cough, or coughing up blood with stagnant fire in the lungs, taking it will surely worsen the cough and increase shortness of breath, due to its sweet and warm nature which may obstruct qi. White Peony root is a remedy for cooling and benefiting the blood; if there is blood deficiency with abdominal pain, it is certainly necessary. However, for those who are thin and weak, or have innate cold deficiency, taking it may harm the vital energy and is best avoided, given its sour and cold properties. The properties of herbs can be toxic; it is not easy to enumerate them all, and students should thoroughly study the details of herbal medicine; they should not recklessly apply them, as it may lead to fatalities.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Labor Exhaustion</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Yin deficiency generates internal heat. It also says: Yin energy, when still, allows the spirit to be stored; when disturbed, it diminishes. If food and drink are excessive, the stomach and intestines will be harmed. It further states: If there is fatigue, the physical energy diminishes, the essence of grains does not flourish, the upper burner does not function, the lower abdomen is obstructed, and the stomach energy is hot, thus producing internal heat. Therefore, to nourish Yin and prolong life, the heart and spirit should be serene and not agitated, diet should be moderate without excess, and one must diligently avoid wind, cold, heat, and dampness. Regularity in resting and activities is essential. Why should there be fear or labor? Nowadays, excessive desires lack restraint, daily routines are irregular, the fires of the seven emotions and six desires stir frequently within, and overindulgence in eating and fatigue repeatedly harms the body, gradually leading to a depletion of true water, the upward blaze of Yin fire resulting in oppressive dryness and heat. There may be fluctuating cold and heat, resembling but not quite being malaria; ancient texts named this condition &quot;Steam Disease,&quot; categorized into twenty-four or thirty-six kinds. Though the names vary, the symptoms are quite similar. Generally, this manifests as coughing, fever, coughing up blood, phlegm, white discharge, nocturnal emissions, and profuse sweating. It may also cause confusion of the spirit, dreams of interactions with spirits, and in women, menstrual blockage leading to gradual decline, ultimately resulting in the signs of labor exhaustion.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Those who fall ill usually become increasingly negligent, allowing their condition to persist over time until they experience relentless fever, extreme emaciation, and depletion of their vital essence. Only then do they seek medical treatment. Even if they manage to recover, the chances of saving them are slim, which is truly lamentable! However, one person&#39;s plight is not to be pitied alone; especially if they are caring for close relatives or kin. Over time, they absorb negative energies and face infections, which are referred to as &quot;transmission of corpses,&quot; also known as &quot;loss of spirits,&quot; &quot;fleeing corpses,&quot; &quot;wandering spirits,&quot; &quot;spirits of death,&quot; and &quot;ghostly influence.&quot; This terminology reflects the cruelty of the transmission and the ineffable nature of its effect. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that all of this stems from weakened life force, overexertion of the heart and kidneys leading to such conditions. It may begin with a single individual’s negligence, but can spread to dozens or even hundreds, and in some cases, lead to the annihilation of entire families or clans. This illness is particularly detestable; if the heat and toxins accumulate over a long period, it can give rise to bizarre abnormalities and harmful creatures that feast on human organs and essence, transforming into various strange forms, truly a source of horror.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Therefore, those who are injured by overwork in the liver and gallbladder are afflicted by pests resembling hairworms, such as those that eat human sinews; those injured in the heart and small intestine are afflicted by insects resembling moths and mosquitoes, which consume human blood vessels; those injured in the spleen and stomach are afflicted by worms akin to infants and earthworms, which feed on human muscles; those injured in the lungs and large intestine are afflicted by creatures resembling turtles, tortoises, shrimp, and crabs, which consume human skin fat; those injured in the kidneys and bladder are afflicted by scaled creatures, similar to fish and dragons, which consume bone marrow. Some pests, bearing a fiery disposition, resemble the more harmful winged insects, like owls, with various appearances that are countless. Whenever a person feels these symptoms, it is advisable to seek treatment early; delaying could result in dire consequences. </p>
<p>The methods of treatment involve, firstly, exterminating the pests to eliminate their root cause, and secondly, nourishing the deficiency to restore the true essence. The administration of medicine along the meridians should follow set principles, akin to a skilled butcher carving an ox, ensuring every move is thoughtful and precise. If one waits until the illness has become severe and the vital energy has diminished, even ancient methods of pest eradication and nourishment will leave the patient with little chance of survival, though it may prevent the knowledge from being forgotten by future generations.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>The Gate of Deficiency</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chen]</p>
<p><strong>Various Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p>Blood represents Yin while Qi represents Yang. If there is sudden deficiency without injury, it is easy to recover. If there is deficiency along with loss, it can also be supplemented, but if the deficiency has persisted for a long time and caused damage, one can only achieve partial recovery through nourishment. Generally, when the pulse is often string-like, a soft and large stringless pulse indicates Qi deficiency, while a deep and weak pulse signifies severe Qi deficiency. A stringy yet weak pulse suggests blood deficiency, while a thin and weak pulse indicates severe blood deficiency. Sometimes, a pulse may be weak at the inch but tight at the cubit, suggesting blood deficiency with heat and excessive sweating. Those who are plump with a pale face show Yang deficiency, while those who are thin with a dark and sallow face show Yin deficiency. </p>
<p>Symptoms such as little appetite, confusion of spirit, inability to store essence, and fatigue in the lower back and chest with muscle and bone aches, along with night sweats and cough, indicate deficiency; even observing one or two such signs is enough. </p>
<p><strong>External Causes:</strong> Prolonged exposure to cold can damage Yang. When it descends from above, it first affects the lungs, leading to skin issues and hair loss; second, it damages the heart, resulting in deficient blood vessels and insufficient nourishment of the internal organs, causing women to experience menstrual irregularities; third, it harms the stomach, preventing food and drink from nourishing the skin.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>Treatment should focus on the flavors of pungent and sweet; if it becomes too light for the stomach, then it should not be treated. Prolonged exposure to heat damages the yin, beginning from below and moving upward: first, damage to the kidneys can cause bone wasting, leading to the inability to rise from bed and eventual death; second, damage to the liver can cause the tendons to weaken and lose their ability to contract; third, damage to the spleen can hinder digestion and absorption. Treatment should involve sour and bitter flavors, but if it is excessive for the spleen, then it should not be treated. </p>
<p>Also, there are internal and external causes: fear can deplete essence, with sweating from the heart damaging the pulses; running in fear causes sweating from the liver, harming the tendons; intense movement and labor can lead to sweating from the spleen, harming the flesh; excessive eating leading to sweat from the stomach harms the intestines; carrying heavy loads for long distances, with sweat from the kidneys, harms the bones. </p>
<p>Treatment should involve sour and bitter flavors, but if it disperses the heart&#39;s energy, then it should not be treated. Further, discussing heart and lung damage with a pale complexion and excessive sweating indicates yang deficiency, while liver and kidney damage with body weakness and excessive sweating indicates yin deficiency. The classics say: &quot;To nourish the lung is to increase its qi; to support the heart is to replenish its vigor and blood; to regulate the spleen is to adjust diet and fit it to cold and warmth; to soothe the liver is to ease the internal; to benefit the kidneys is to replenish essence.&quot;<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Thus, for the syndrome of lung damage as seen in ancient texts, one should use the Four Gentlemen Decoction; for heart damage, the Four Substances Decoction; for damage to both heart and lung, the Eight Substances Decoction; for damage to the heart, lung, and spleen-stomach, the Complete Support Decoction; for damage to both liver and kidney, the Niu Xi Pill; for miscellaneous syndromes of new deficiency and dreams of leakage, the Cinnamon Twig Decoction plus dragon bone and oyster; for heaviness and aching in the limbs, palpitations, and abdominal pain, the Minor Construct the Center Decoction; for excessive sweating and weakness, with tense sinews and bones, the Astragalus Construct the Center Decoction; for excessive sweating with a rolling pulse, the Honey-Fried Licorice Decoction; for sudden damage with qi deficiency and sweating with tidal heat, the Tonify the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction; for qi deficiency without sweating and tidal heat, the Ginseng Clear the Muscle Powder; for sudden damage with blood deficiency, sweating, and tidal heat, the Ginseng Nourish Honor Decoction; for blood deficiency without sweating and tidal heat, the Poria Heart Nourishing Decoction; for sudden blood loss, the Benefit Stomach and Elevate Yang Decoction; for tidal sweating and phlegm cough, the Astragalus Benefit Loss Decoction plus Pinellia; after serious illness with reduced appetite and night sweats, the Ginseng Poria Atractylodes Powder plus Astragalus and Angelica. </p>
<p>Internal causes: the five labors, six extremes, and seven injuries can accumulate into deficiency and lead to damage; when damage accumulates into injury and fails to heal for years, it is called chronic deficiency. The five labors correspond to the five internal organs, and the six extremes correspond to the six bowels.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>When the heart is overworked and the spirit is strained, the blood vessels weaken, and the face loses color, leading to palpitations, nightmares, and sweating during sleep; in severe cases, this results in heart pain and throat swelling. When the liver is overexerted through excessive thinking, the muscles and bones become taut, and in extreme cases, dizziness and headache occur. When the spleen is strained by excessive worries, one experiences bloating and reduced appetite; in severe cases, this leads to vomiting, diarrhea, emaciation, and fatigue in the limbs, with pain in the joints, shoulders, and back. When the lungs are overworked due to anxiety about future events, there is a lack of energy, coldness in the chest and abdomen, and pain in the chest and back; in extreme cases, there may be a dry cough and heat from a lack of fluids. When the kidneys are over-restrained, there is pain in the lower back, and one may experience seminal emissions and turbidity; in extreme cases, there is a dirty complexion and spinal pain. These five ailments correspond to the five extremes. If the organs become weak due to deficiency in the bowels, and both the organs and bowels are deficient, the senses decline, movements become unsteady, this is called the extreme of essence, causing weaknesses in essence and vitality, thus it is also termed the six extremes. The extremes signify injury. The seven injuries stem from the causes of extreme exertion: prolonged viewing damages blood, prolonged lying damages energy, prolonged sitting damages flesh, prolonged standing injures bones, and prolonged walking strains muscles. Thinking and worrying over matters damages the heart and kidneys, leading to deficiency in yin and blood; laboring through hunger and satiation harms the stomach and bowels, causing deficiency in yang energy. These are the critical signs of injury. For yin deficiency, one may use Si Wu Decoction, Er Yi Pill, or Shen Qi Pill. For fire rising due to external urges, one can use Si Wu Decoction with Zhimu and Huangbo, or formulas like Zhi Yin Jiang Huo Decoction, Jia Wei Xiaoyao Powder, or Bu Yin Pill. For severe heat and dryness, one can take Da Bu Yin Pill or Shan Tianmen Dong Paste.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>For Yang deficiency: Si Jun Zi Tang or Bao Yuan Tang. For those with weakened fire and cold body: Lu Rong Da Bu Tang, Congrong San, Jia Jian Nei Gu Wan, San Xian Dan, Wen Shen Wan, Tui Han Bu Tian Wan, Ban Long Wan. </p>
<p>For both Yin and Yang deficiency: Ba Wu Tang, Gu Zhen Yin Zi or Wan, Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang, or Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Congrong, Fu Zi, Ban Xia, and Mai Men Dong, or Ba Wei Wan. If there is excess fire: Er Zhi Wan or Yi Lei You Qing Wan.</p>
<p>For heart deficiency: Ren Shen Gu Ben Wan, Meng Shou Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, Zhu Zi Du Shu Wan; for liver deficiency: Tian Ma Wan, Lu Rong Si Jin Wan; for spleen deficiency: Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, Ju Pi Jian Wan, Cang Zhu Gao, Bai Zhu Gao, Shen Ling Zao Hua Gao, Tai He Geng; for lung deficiency: Dan Ren Shen Gao, Dan Wu Wei Zi Gao; for kidney deficiency: Xiao Tu Si Zi Wan, Yuan Tu Gu Ben Wan, San Wei An Shen Wan, Tai Ji Wan. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether Yin or Yang is damaged, it is all due to the imbalance of water and fire.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>When the fire descends, the blood vessels flow harmoniously; when the water rises, the spirit is filled. There may be deficiencies in the heart and kidneys, or in the heart and spleen, or in the heart and liver, or in the lungs and kidneys, or in all five organs. However, the focus should be on harmonizing the heart and kidneys while also supplementing the spleen and stomach, allowing digestion to improve and the spirit, energy, and blood to replenish themselves. </p>
<p>To harmonize the heart and kidneys, if there is heat among the deficiencies, use the Gu An Heart-Kidney Pill; if there is cold, use the Jiu Yuan Heart-Kidney Pill. For those who do not respond to strong tonics, use the Gui Rong Pill, Rui Lian Pill, or Leng Bu Pill. For supplementing the spleen and stomach, use the Er Shen Jiao Ji Dan, Huan Shao Dan, Tian Zhen Pill, or Fan Ben Pill. </p>
<p>A deficiency indicates a downward weakness; excess indicates an upward heat. Moreover, in terms of deficiency and excess, when the righteous energy is deficient, the pathogenic energy is real. If the heart is overworked by pathogenic heat, it leads to sores in the mouth and tongue, slurred speech, and emaciation; if the liver is overworked by pathogenic heat, it results in pain in the ribs and obstruction; if the spleen is overworked by pathogenic heat, it causes breathlessness, muscle weakness, and excessive sweating; if the lungs are overworked by pathogenic heat, it causes shortness of breath, facial swelling, dry mouth, and throat; if the kidneys are overworked by pathogenic heat, it leads to blood in the urine, skin sores, tinnitus, and urinary retention. The San Bai Decoction is prescribed for these conditions.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>For heart heat, add Huanglian, Muktong, Maidong, and Shengdi. For liver heat, add Huangqin, Fangfeng, Danggui, Longdancao, and Chishaoyao. For spleen heat, add Shanzhi, Shihu, and Shengma. For lung heat, add Zhimu, Sangbaihu, Qinjiao, and Tingli. For kidney heat, add Yuanshen, Chifang, Cheqianzizi, and Shengdi. Further reference to treatment methods for accumulated heat and deficiency fire.</p>
<p>For those with qi stagnation, use Jiaogang Dan. The ancient monastery states: the heart and kidneys govern blood; the heart dislikes heat and the kidneys dislike dryness, so the medicines for clearing heat and moisturizing dryness serve to nourish the heart and kidneys while draining the lungs and spleen. The lungs and spleen govern qi; the lungs dislike cold and the spleen dislike dampness, hence warming, drying, and nourishing medicines serve to replenish the lungs and spleen while draining the heart and kidneys. The “Basic Formula” generally employs spicy and aromatic drying agents, as they strengthen the spleen and promote appetite; however, when yin blood and yin qi deplete, it causes severe deficiency fire, resulting in a flushed face, wheezing, profuse phlegm, a body burning like fire, swollen feet, diarrhea, and a tight pulse leading to a failure to eat, which can result in death. Alas! All deficiencies stem from the lack of yin blood and yin qi. If true yang deficiency exists, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>The classics say: for those whose form is insufficient, warm them with qi. Nurture and maintain to allow qi to refill, which is not to be misconstrued as using harsh warming medicines for supplementation.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>Those who lack essence should supplement it with the natural flavors of heaven and earth, not merely luxurious food. In modern times, there are those who, without illness, excessively seek supplements and thereby become ill; there are also those who, despite being sick, indulge in supplements without relying on appropriate medication, which further increases phlegm and heat. It is not only about overcoming deficiencies to prolong life, nor is it the way to nourish the heart and cultivate one&#39;s nature. </p>
<p>Furthermore, young individuals whose vital fire is particularly vigorous should especially avoid excessive supplementation. After middle age, one must rely on medicinal foods to support oneself, but this must be done in moderation. It is better to administer treatment gently and not to impose immediate results; otherwise, it may lead to severe ailments. </p>
<p>Generally, those with kidney deficiency should take refined elixirs like Qiongyu ointment, Huanyuan Qiushi pill, or the longevity elixir. For those experiencing decline in hearing and sight, the Huanyuan pill, Sisheng longevity pill, or Songbai fruit pill may be suitable. If the kidney deficiency lacks heat, they might opt for He Shou Wu pill or the Juelao Wuxu Jianyang pill. If there is kidney deficiency with heat, the Baxian Tianshou pill is recommended. For the emaciated, the Dazao pill or Ziheche elixir can be used. Those suffering from blood diseases may benefit from Nvzhen pill, Baiye decoction, Baizhi pill, or Chengjin pill. For wind ailments accompanied by stomach heat, one might use Songzhi pill or Songmei pill. If the wind ailment is without heat, Xiannian rice is appropriate. For phlegm and heat causing urinary difficulties, Fuling decoction is suggested. The weak in qi may require Dan Ren Shen ointment. For dryness of blood, options include Dan Tianmendong ointment or Dihuang ointment. Those with spleen deficiency should consider Baizhu ointment. In cases of both spleen and kidney deficiency, the Jiawei Cangzhu ointment may be necessary. All these are medicines to nourish the nature and prolong life, and should be selected according to one’s illness.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Tuberculosis</strong></p>
<p>Yang-type fever and tuberculosis: dry mouth, sore tongue and throat, thick and sticky phlegm, restless pain in the hands and feet, yellowish-red urine, and dry, constipated stools. Yin-type deficiency and tuberculosis: white phlegm in saliva, stomach reversal with nausea, difficulty digesting food, frequent urination, sperm leakage that is thick and cloudy, and loose stools. There are also cases of cough with phlegm where lying on the back is impossible; this indicates a combination of yin and yang diseases, often resulting from the ages of fifteen to sixteen or around twenty, when the blood and qi are unstable, with excessive drinking and indulgence harming the essence and blood, primarily leading to yin deficiency. Occasionally, prolonged external influences like chronic malaria or cough induce this, often associated with yang deficiency. Heat-induced throat ulcers causing loss of voice result in death, as do persistent diarrheal conditions from yin deficiency. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a yin or yang illness, prolonged duration can lead to transformation. In males, the disease can be transmitted from the kidney to the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen; in females, from the heart to the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The five organs will transmit to the six bowels and lead to death. There are cases where only one meridian is affected throughout, or specifically from the heart to the kidneys without transmission. The pulse serves as evidence for diagnosis. </p>
<p>Night sweats and cough may present with blood, or sperm leakage and turbid stools, or diarrhea; in mild cases, these six symptoms may alternate, while in severe cases, all six symptoms may manifest simultaneously. When fire rises above, it causes cough with blood and tidal heat; when fire stirs below, it causes turbid sperm and diarrhea.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>If there is blood present, stopping the bleeding should be the priority. Although there are many varying symptoms, they ultimately must conform to a primary principle. If there are signs of both clarity and turbidity, along with pain in the waist and legs, this indicates the pathology resides in the kidneys. If there is excessive coughing up of blood and accompanied by sweating, fear, and ulcers in the mouth, it indicates the heart is affected. If there is coughing with blood, along with dryness of the skin, nasal congestion, and a heavy voice, it indicates the lungs are involved. If there is nocturnal emission, along with pain in the sides, anger, and swelling in the neck, it suggests the liver is distressed. If there is diarrhea, alongside abdominal pain, food aversion, and weakness in the limbs, it indicates an issue with the spleen. One should adjust treatment according to the location of the pathology.</p>
<p>For conditions of labor heat, use Qinggu San. For internal heat, use Baozhen Tang. For heat in the evening, use Huangqi Bieqiao Tang.</p>
<p>For labor-related coughing up blood, use Taiping Wan. For symptoms of coughing and expectoration of blood, use Baohe Tang. If there is a significant loss of blood, use Sanhuang Buxue Tang. If the bleeding does not stop, use Shihui San or Danhuarui Shisan.</p>
<p>For weary cough and dry cough, use Renshen Runfei Wan, Baohe Tang, Taiping Wan, or Ningfei Tang. For lung wasting, use Zhimu Fuling Tang. For lung abscess, use Jiegeng Tang or Dan Baiqi San.</p>
<p>For labor-related diarrhea, use Baizhu Gao, Bajin Tang, or Shenqi Wan.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Labor deficiency refers to fatigue. When the vital energy and blood are exhausted and stagnant, it results in blockages and inefficiencies, allowing evils to proliferate. Furthermore, injuries from fatigue and diet cause the upper burner to malfunction and the middle burner to be obstructed, leading to internal heat from the chest. Any lumps above the neck or within the abdomen, coldness around the navel, or weakness in speech or movement are all caused by the accumulation of phlegm and the stagnation of vital energy and blood. Therefore, one should first focus on opening the stomach and regulating the flow of energy. When the meridian is blocked, the vital energy and blood dry up; if the stomach qi is weak, the medicine cannot circulate. However, one should not rely solely on spicy or aromatic herbs for yang deficiency, nor on bitter or cooling herbs for yin deficiency. Although the formulas like Kai Guan San and Ding Wei San from Dongyuan are difficult to apply now, one should extract their principles and adapt them accordingly.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>For a Yang disease, use formulas to clear heat and promote urination. It is advisable to add Bai San with Yin Chai Hu, Qin Jiao, Jie Geng, Mu Tong, Ze Xie, Dang Gui, Shao Yao, and Mu Xiang, primarily to address frequent urination.</p>
<p>For a Yin disease, employ formulas to regulate phlegm and Qi. Use Er Chen Tang with extra Bian Zhi, Bei Mu, Mu Dan Pi, Dang Gui, Shan Zha, Su Geng, and a small amount of Sheng Di and Mu Xiang, focusing on reducing phlegm with clearer Qi.</p>
<p>For both Yin and Yang conditions, use Shen Ling Bai Zhu San or San Bai Tang, or Er Chen Tang with Bai Zhu, Shen Qu, and Mai Ya to invigorate the spleen and stomach. If there is diarrhea, it is especially advisable to take these remedies in larger quantities and for a longer duration, waiting for the gastric Qi to stabilize before using treatments based on symptoms.</p>
<p>Traditional methods suggest using Sheng Xi San, Fang Feng Dang Gui Tang, or San Bu Wan and Dan Huang Lian Wan to treat heat-related conditions, but these should only be used when the condition is newly onset and the body is resilient.</p>
<p>Chronic weakness results from accumulated losses. For Yang deficiency, remedies include Jie Lao San, Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and Dan Ren Shen Tang. For Yin deficiency, include Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Zi Yin Jiang Huo Tang, Jie Zhai Si Wu Tang, Bu Yin Wan, Da Zao Wan, and Bu Tian Wan. For severe deficiency, consider Qiong Yu Gao and Bai Feng Gao.</p>
<p>An ancient saying states: “Taking cooling medicines often does not lead to life, while drinking urine generally does not result in death.” However, for those with weak spleen and stomach or deficient Qi and blood, it is essential to include tonic medicines mixed with child urine, instead of relying solely on heat-clearing medicines. Nowadays, some excessively use Zhi, Bo He, and Sheng Di which can burden the spleen, while others solely focus on using Ren Shen, Gui Zhi, and Fu Zi to bolster fire.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>To treat coughing, one should use functions like the following: Dodecahedron, Ziwan, (Herb) Winter, Indigo, and Oysters to nourish the liver channel. To treat blood issues, one should employ Jing墨 and Jinshi&#39;s cold qualities to avoid damaging the vital energy and blood. To reduce tide (an analogy for turmoil), one should use Yin Chaihu and Hu Huanglian to dispel excess flesh. For nocturnal emissions, one should use Dragon Bone and Shizhi to tone the essence, but these remedies do not address the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Parasites also result from stagnation of vital energy and blood, with phlegm and stasis turning into them. Primarily, one should nourish vital energy and blood, supplemented with herbs like Wumei, Qinghao, and Zhusha to eradicate them. Options include Ziheche Dan, Ziheche Wan, Qinghao Gao, Hegai San, and Tianlinggai San.</p>
<p>The theory of transmitted corpse (disease) does not require deep inquiry. Historically, labor illness has stemmed from indulgence in wine, lust, wealth, and passion, which damages heart blood and causes tumultuous fire. Physicians fail to differentiate between yin and yang in treatments, and patients often neglect the origins of their ailments, blaming previous generations&#39; misdeeds, even attributing issues to houses, utensils, and graves, including the distress of wandering corpses.</p>
<p>Ancient wisdom stated that there are thirty-six types of labor illnesses, which can only be resolved through accumulated virtue. Those unfortunate enough to contract such diseases should retreat to mountains or quiet places, maintain a peaceful mind and sit in stillness, often burning incense and biting their teeth, focusing on nourishment while abstaining from excessive desires. Only then can the root of the illness be severed. Ignoring these restrictions and taking medications will not yield results.</p>
<p>Medical Principles 【Ming Lou Ying】</p>
<p>　　　　Deficiency and Labor<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The term &quot;emptiness&quot; refers to the deficiency of skin, muscles, tendons, nails, bone marrow, vital energy, blood, and bodily fluids. If men and women labor all day, exhausting their spirits and sapping their strength, alternating between hunger and satiety, experiencing joy and anger, worry and thought, suffering from cold and drinking cold liquids, and indulging in their desires, it is said in the &quot;Suwen&quot;: today, many people are weakened before reaching the age of fifty, treating wine as a common drink, regarding indulgence as normal, getting drunk and entering bedrooms for desires that exhaust their essence and dissipate their true energy. The source of this leads to emptiness and depletion, so how can the five organs and six viscera not become weak? The &quot;Five Labors,&quot; &quot;Six Extreme Weaknesses,&quot; and &quot;Seven Injuries&quot; all begin from here. </p>
<p>What are the Five Labors? Heart labor leads to blood loss; liver labor harms the spirit; spleen labor damages food intake; lung labor diminishes vital energy; kidney labor destroys essence. The &quot;Six Extremes&quot; refer to the exhaustion of tendons, sinews, muscles, skin, and bones. The &quot;Seven Injuries,&quot; as detailed in the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; injure the form and the vital energy, and can be summarized under the concept of emptiness. Generally speaking, the five elements and six energies identify water as only one-fifth of the whole. If one water is depleted, can it possibly overcome the five fires? Symptoms of weakness and exhaustion therefore arise in abundance. Those who are physically weak are most susceptible to evil energies; the first step is to harmonize and relieve them, applying minimal herbs and treating them with gentleness, then gradually adjusting. </p>
<p>If a physician does not recognize that evil energy has latched onto the body and has not been removed, yet proceeds with tonifying supplements, then the evil energy receives nourishment, enters the meridians, leading to an untreatable condition resulting in death; such mistakes occur to countless individuals, which is truly lamentable! The &quot;Neijing&quot; originally doesn&#39;t mention labor as a diagnosis but states that labor is meant to nourish. What is deficient should be supplemented with tastes from grains, meats, vegetables, and fruits—all serve as nourishment.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>Today’s physicians do not understand their principles; they only know the method of treating with heating tonics. For mild cases, they use Angelica root, deer antler, and various other invigorating substances; for severe cases, they resort to milk stone and cinnabar, using moxa to heat and dry out the body’s fluids. When the fluids are heated, they dry up, leading to excessive heat, resulting in dry coughs, phlegm, blood, and a clammy fever, along with thirst and a preference for cold; this indicates excessive heat. In severe cases, one may lose their voice, which is irreparable. Yet they continue to administer harsh tonics, causing the death of the patient; the physician then becomes the cause of death.</p>
<p>When a skilled practitioner applies cleansing remedies, and they do not align with the patient’s condition, they are met with unwarranted criticism. Moreover, when they hear of treatments targeting the interior, they hesitate and do not follow, willingly accepting death at the hands of inept practitioners who use heating tonics. Even in death, they do not regret this; it is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Cooling remedies can nourish fluids and clear heat, while heating remedies can dry fluids and bolster heat. Matters in the world all adhere to principles; once the principles are clear, what worry is there about the illness not resolving? If labor manifests as evidence of heat, can it still be supplemented? Only those without pathogens, heat, or accumulated issues, whose pulses are weak and feeble, may be supplemented. It is also essential to observe whether their stomach and right kidney fire are deficient before proceeding.</p>
<p>If the heart is deficient, there will be palpitations, confusion, anxiety with a pale tongue, and they should use nourishing decoctions or amber pills to enrich their heart blood. If the spleen is deficient, there will be a sallow complexion, thinness, clear vomiting or diarrhea, abdominal distension, rumbling intestines, weakness in the limbs, and a lack of appetite; in this case, they should use stomach tonics or appetite-promoting pills to regulate their diet. If the liver is deficient, there could be blurred vision, muscular cramps, a pale complexion, and a state of fearfulness resembling someone about to be captured; for this, they should use Cow Knee Decoction or Tiger Bone Pills to nourish and assist the sinews.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>If there is lung deficiency, characterized by shortness of breath, coughing, a dry throat, it is advisable to use a decoction of bitter orange combined with ginseng, astragalus, donkey-hide gelatin, and perilla seeds to regulate the qi. In cases of kidney deficiency with pain in the lower back and knees, fatigue, tinnitus, and frequent urination with leakage, it is advisable to take an eight-ingredient pill combined with schisandra and deer antler, avoiding aconite and using yam to nourish the essence.</p>
<p>For consumption combined with phlegm accumulation, the symptoms include persistent heat in the abdomen and flanks, while hands and feet may occasionally feel cool around the hours of Yin and Yang. If stubborn phlegm is difficult to treat, it is essential to use an emetic method, or to administer drugs like agarwood phlegm pills or penetrating partition pills. In more severe cases, reverse warehouse methods may be employed. If phlegm accumulation obstructs the meridians, it is extremely difficult to treat when the Taichong pulse and the inch pulse of Chongyang are rapid and do not correspond.</p>
<p>For deficiency disorders followed by pathogenic heat, Chaihu should be used. The &quot;Extended Meaning&quot; states: in the &quot;Classic,&quot; Chaihu is not mentioned for treating consumption, yet in modern formulas it is rarely omitted for this purpose, which can mislead many. The fundamental cause of consumption is often true organ deficiency that has become affected by pathogenic heat, leading to consumption as a result of deficiency. Therefore, consumption signifies stagnation, and one should carefully consider this. </p>
<p>In familiar formulas for treating consumption heat, Qinghao decoction with Chaihu is appropriate. Upon taking it, there are no exceptions; the heat must be addressed urgently. If there is no pathogenic heat, the treatment can indeed worsen the condition. Even to death, a person would bear no complaint. Wang Haizang stated: if there is no true heat, and a doctor uses it, what is there to wait for if not death? Those who use it should be careful. Additionally, one must avoid using Qín, Lián, or Bó hastily with pure cold bitter medicines, as this will counteract the yang.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>To use substances like fragrant ointment, greatly helps the Yang energy, allowing it to return to its rightful position. It is also necessary to slightly reduce the Yin fire with some medicine. Ge Hong says: Ghost afflictions are one of the five types of afflictions. Furthermore, among the various malevolent spirits, their transformations can range from thirty-six to ninety-nine kinds, generally causing people to feel sluggish, silent, not knowing their suffering, leading to evil everywhere. Over the years, this accumulation can result in stagnation and ultimately death, affecting others to the point of family extinction. </p>
<p>If one becomes aware of the afflicted state, they should urgently treat with a fresh otter liver, dry it in the shade, powder it, and ingest the powder with water using a small spoon, three times a day until effective. If results are unknown after the first course, further dosages are advised. This remedy is remarkably effective. A master at the Tianqing Temple, through strict examination, encountered a woman who submitted a request stating that the afflicted person was possessed. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed: &quot;It is not my fault; it is another spirit causing trouble, stemming from the patient&#39;s weakened life force.&quot; It had already taken form in the afflicted person&#39;s lungs as a worm, eating away at the lung tissues, causing hemoptysis and a hoarse voice. The master questioned the worm: &quot;Can you still achieve longevity?&quot; After a long silence, when questioned again, it eventually replied: &quot;Only fearing the powdered claw of the otter, if taken with wine, I will leave.&quot; The afflicted family found that following its words led to recovery; this is what I have personally witnessed. </p>
<p>The affliction is indeed similar. Is the otter claw similar to the otter liver? The transmission of dead body afflictions, such as diseases, can pass between family members, sometimes leading to complete family destruction. This is often tied to ancestral debts or linked to geographical factors. Although talismans, incantations, and methods of dispelling with water can remove the ailment, it does not guarantee complete wellness, but if one can regularly maintain their health, healing will naturally occur.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Medical Canon Must-Read</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Deficiency Syndrome</strong>  </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; deficiency syndrome primarily concerns both Qi and blood. It was not until the work of Chao Shi in &quot;Sources of Diseases&quot; that the five organs&#39; deficiencies and the seven emotions&#39; injuries were distinguished. It even further categorized the six elements of Qi, blood, tendons, bones, muscles, and essence, and divided them into twenty-three components including brain, marrow, uterus, vessels, blood, tendons, meridians, liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, bladder, gallbladder, stomach, triple energizer, large and small intestines, flesh, skin, and Qi. The &quot;Principles of Therapy&quot; further divides the causes of disease into as many as ninety-nine types. With this intricate categorization, scholars have become confused by the myriad paths, leading to the erroneous use of formulas, blurring the lines of culpability. Why not adhere to the &quot;Inner Classic&quot;? It succinctly delineates the spleen and kidneys as the governing organs of Qi and blood, making it straightforward and reliable.  </p>
<p>In humans, deficiency lies either in Qi or blood, and all five organs must be considered. The reason for emphasizing the spleen and kidneys is that water is the source of all things, and earth is the mother of all things. When these two organs are in harmony, the whole body is treated, and myriad diseases do not arise. The spleen possesses the qualities of earth; when the spleen is stabilized, it nurtures the mother of metal above, where metal strengthens the source of water. Moreover, earth should not overshadow water; when water holds its position, the spleen is stabilized, which in turn leads to the kidneys&#39; harmony. Furthermore, the kidneys encompass both water and fire; when the kidneys are stable, water does not overwhelm the liver and invade the dampness of earth. Fire can also aid earth in transformation and refinement. Therefore, with the kidneys stable, the spleen will likewise be secure. Sun Simiao stated: &quot;Nourishing the spleen is superior to nourishing the kidneys.&quot; Scholar Xu stated: &quot;Nourishing the kidneys is inferior to nourishing the spleen.&quot;<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The two masters deeply understand that the kidneys are the foundation of life, and they also recognize the mutually supportive functions of the two organs. Thus, although their statements seem contradictory, their essence is actually the same. To nourish the kidneys, one must start with yin blood. Blood governs moisture and belongs to yin, which is associated with descent. When deficient, it tends to rise; it should be gathered and suppressed, thus the use of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. To nourish the spleen, one must start with yang energy. Qi governs warmth and is associated with yang, which promotes ascent. When deficient, it tends to sink; it should be uplifted and raised, thus the use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.</p>
<p>In recent years, the treatment for labor deficiencies has relied on Si Wu Tang with additions of Huang Lian and Zhi Mu, without realizing that all four ingredients are yin and operate under the influences of autumn and winter, which are not conducive to generating all forms of life. Moreover, blood medicines are often stagnant and are not suitable for those suffering from phlegm and poor appetite. Blood medicines tend to be moistening, and prolonged use can lead to loose stools. Huang Lian and Zhi Mu, being bitter and cold by nature, can drain excess heat. It is named for nourishing yin, but in truth, it is drying and detrimental to blood; it is deemed to clear heat, yet it bitterly enters the heart first, and over time can increase qi, which ultimately can assist heat. As for its damaging effect on the stomach, there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>Dan Xi stated: Excess heat can be drained, while deficient heat can be replenished. In cases of labor-related heat, is it deficient or excess? Can it be drained? Those who correct their imbalances often use Gui Zhi and Fu Zi as daily remedies, which are only suitable for those with weak fire. However, for individuals with dry heat in blood and qi, can they avoid the harm of assisting fire? Generally, symptoms of deficiency and labor are often complex; for nourishing the spleen and protecting the lungs, one must consider both approaches. Yet the spleen prefers warmth and dryness, while the lungs prefer clarity and moisture. Protecting the lungs may impede the spleen, and nourishing the spleen may obstruct the lungs.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>In cases of severe dryness and heat, where one can eat without experiencing diarrhea, it is essential to moisten the lungs urgently, and medicine to tonify the spleen cannot be omitted. If the condition is severely weak, with little eating and excessive diarrhea, though there are signs of wheezing and coughing, it is urgent to tonify the spleen, while cooling and moistening substances should be avoided. The spleen has the capacity to generate the lungs, while the lungs lack the power to support the spleen; thus, medicines to tonify the spleen are particularly important for preserving the lungs. I have often seen patients with exhaustion die mostly from diarrhea; the cause of diarrhea is often due to cooling and moistening. Can those in charge of fate not be wary of this? Additionally, tonifying the kidneys and regulating the spleen should be done simultaneously. However, if one intends to use sweet and cold substances to tonify the kidneys, yet the person reduces their food intake, it may not benefit the spleen; conversely, if one wants to use pungent and warming substances to invigorate the spleen, but the person&#39;s yin is damaged, it may further deplete their fluids. Both aspects must be balanced, with emphasis on the spleen because the spleen (earth) connects upward to the heart and downward to the kidneys. If there is severe deficiency in the kidneys and the condition is dire, one should not be overly restrictive. It is important to know that nourishing the kidneys should incorporate cardamom and sandalwood, while strengthening the spleen should include ingredients like five-flavor fruit and cinnamon, adjusting according to the time and method. Furthermore, without yang, yin cannot thrive; without yin, yang cannot transform, indicating it must not be one-sided. However, Dong Yuan said: sweet and warm substances can eliminate great heat. He also stated: blood loss requires replenishing qi. And again: solely yin cannot sustain growth. The warmth of spring and summer can promote development; the cold of autumn and winter cannot support growth. Those who are deficient must be supplemented with the sweet warmth of ginseng, aligning with the principle that yang generates yin. Moreover, those with deficiency due to exhaustion can be treated with supplementation; those who do not accept supplementation cannot be treated.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>Therefore, the use of astragalus can indeed treat fatigue effectively. Its properties are primarily nourishing, and in all methodologies, it is employed in seven of the ten cases. Danxi emphasizes nourishing the yin, and his treatment plans for fatigue also utilize astragalus in seven out of ten cases. In situations where astragalus is not used, it is either because the injury is fresh or the condition is milder. </p>
<p>Those who stubbornly believe that lung heat damages the lungs and that abstaining from food while taking astragalus will lead to death have influenced subsequent generations, leading them to willingly adopt harsh and cold treatments. This often results in severe vomiting and diarrhea, yet they remain unrepentant, which is truly lamentable. </p>
<p>Fortunately, Li Binhai and Wang Shishan have provided detailed explanations for this issue, but old habits are hard to break, and disasters continue to follow. They do not realize that the lung meridian can have heat, and when the lung pulse is pressed, it may feel solid; in such cases, astragalus is genuinely inappropriate. When fire invades metal, the lung pulse feels weak, the lung qi is significantly damaged, and only astragalus can offer protection.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The ancients have said: When the earth is strong, metal is produced; do not be overly strict about preserving the lungs. When water is abundant, fire is extinguished; do not be excessively concerned with a serene heart. This can be said to comprehend the essence of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and to deeply understand the principles of treatment.</p>
<p>Chronic exhaustion and heat toxins can lead to the generation of harmful insects that consume one’s internal organs, resulting in symptoms such as steaming heat cough, chest tightness and back pain, unclear vision, weakness in the limbs, and soreness in the lower back and knees, with inability to sleep when lying down. One may also display pale complexion or red cheeks, often harboring anger, dreaming of encounters with spirits, sharing afflictions closely, suffering from multiple infections, and even facing total ruin—this is certainly to be feared. The treatment must focus on replenishing the deficiency to restore the original state and eliminating the insects to eradicate the root cause. If the insects are exterminated, the patient, though ill, will not suffer further contagion. Those who are near to this ailment should not be hungry. The deficient ones must take tonics; it is advisable to wear the calming incense and musk, for then the pestilence will not dare to invade.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Causes of the Five Labors, Six Extremes, and Seven Injuries</strong></p>
<p>The Five Labors refer to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. Laboring the heart leads to depletion of spirit and blood, resulting in ailments like palpitations. Laboring the liver results in excessive anger and fiery disposition, causing tears and blurred vision, and potentially leading to rib pain and fatigue, making it difficult to stand or travel. Laboring the lungs, due to excessive worry, depletes qi, leading to dryness and lack of fluids, resulting in dry cough, hoarseness, and constipation. Laboring the spleen from fatigue injures it, causing fever, aversion to cold, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weakness in limbs, leading to lethargy and an inclination to lie down, eventually tiring the kidneys and resulting in yin deficiency, manifesting as cowardice. Laboring the kidneys through excessive desire, producing cloudy discharge and loss of essence, leads to problems where yin fails to ascend and yang fails to descend. If kidney water does not rise, the heart and lungs lack nourishment, causing symptoms like cough with blood. The so-called labors of today originate from these.</p>
<p>The Six Extremes refer to wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire. Each can elicit disease when excessively encountered. Some may recover through medicine but ultimately suffer long-term damage from indulgent influences, compromising their fundamental energy, leading to lifelong detriment.</p>
<p>The Seven Injuries refer to the emotional states of joy, anger, worry, thought, sadness, fear, and shock, which, when excessive, can cause harm. Specifically, excessive thought can gradually lead to consumption-related diseases. Many contemporary ailments stem from the labors of the spleen and kidneys, especially those from excessive worry and thought. The ancient sages spoke of the Five Labors, Six Extremes, and Seven Injuries to illustrate these conditions.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br><strong>Long-term Illness Leads to Parasites</strong></p>
<p>Chronic weakness and heat toxins, if accumulated over time, can give rise to strange and harmful creatures that consume the essence of the internal organs, transforming into various frightening forms. This is indeed alarming. When the liver and gallbladder are damaged, it manifests as hairy larvae, resembling the shape of a hedgehog or maggot, consuming the fascia. Damage to the heart and small intestine leads to winged insects, resembling moths or mosquitoes, feasting on blood vessels. Injury to the spleen and stomach results in worm-like creatures, similar to infant earthworms, that consume muscle tissue. Damage to the lungs and large intestine presents as shell-like insects, akin to turtles, shrimps, or crabs, which eat the skin&#39;s moisture. If the kidneys and bladder are affected, scaly creatures appear, resembling fish, dragons, or carp, devouring the bone marrow. There may also be fiery manifestations, akin to terrifying winged insects or owls, with diverse forms that are countless. Whenever a person exhibits these signs, timely treatment is advisable; delay may result in irreparable consequences. The methods of treatment involve firstly replenishing the deficiency to restore the true essence, and secondly exterminating the parasites to eliminate the root cause. If the parasites can be killed, then even if new ones do not arise, it can prevent future generations from suffering from this affliction.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>There are nine types of parasitic insects.</p>
<p>The nine parasitic insects that cause suffering are: First, the伏虫 (fú chóng), measuring four inches long, is the leader of the group; Second, the蛔虫 (huái chóng), measuring one foot long, can kill by piercing the heart; Third, the寸白虫 (cùn bái chóng), one inch long, reproduces rapidly and can grow up to four or five feet long, also capable of killing; Fourth, the肉虫 (ròu chóng), resembling rotten apricots, causes discomfort; Fifth, the肺虫 (fèi chóng), looking like silkworms, leads to coughing; Sixth, the胃虫 (wèi chóng), resembling frogs, causes nausea and vomiting; Seventh, the弱虫 (ruò chóng), also known as鬲虫 (gé chóng), shaped like melon seeds, induces excessive salivation; Eighth, the赤虫 (chì chóng), resembling raw meat, makes the intestines rumble; Ninth, the蛲虫 (náo chóng), very tiny and resembling cabbage worms, resides in the large intestine, often leading to hemorrhoids, and in severe cases, dysentery, as well as causing boils, sores, scabs, weakness, and dental decay. </p>
<p>All these insects reside within the human intestines and stomachs; if the organs are full, they harm them, and if they are weak, they erode the organs and the blood marrow, transforming into various afflictions, to the point of being incurable.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>When a person&#39;s vital energy is about to be extinguished, it escapes through the nine orifices and pores, striking those who are timid and weak, and after some time, it manifests as signs of illness. This is known as &quot;transmitting the corpse.&quot; If a person regularly preserves their vital energy and cherishes their essence and blood, the illness cannot be transmitted. However, those who indulge in excessive desires and are unaware of their suffering will deplete their essence and blood, allowing malevolent energy to invade; this is true not only for men but also for women. Yet, those with weak energy and depleted blood are the most susceptible to illness. In mourning and during inquiries about ailments, clothing and utensils can transmit illness if one is not careful. If a woman enters the room of a patient, the patient, seeing her and thinking of her, can have their vital energy drawn in, causing sickness over time to transform into parasites. Therefore, those close to the afflicted must avoid contact, ensure that their food and drink are appropriate, and not be overly hungry. For those whose bodies are weak, nourishing medicine can be taken, and keeping a piece of benzoin nearby can effectively eliminate parasites. If it contains musk, it can prevent malevolent influences; physicians should never be without it.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>Attached is a discussion on the pursuit of labor by the Qing Ziting.</p>
<p>Transmission of suffering and pestilence arises from the heart being afflicted. When qi and blood are stagnant, this results in the formation of parasites. This is primarily caused by indulgence in food, drink, and lust, along with worries and the loss of genuine essence, leading to such conditions. All parasites thrive on stagnant blood nourished by qi; in the body, the qi and blood represent the vital essence. When qi stagnates, it manifests as masses; when it becomes stagnant in the heart, it results in parasites. All these issues stem from improper thoughts and the afflictions caused by worry. The harms of the Three Corpses and Nine Parasites are matters of significance for practitioners to understand in detail. Among the Nine Parasites, six are transmitted through six generations, while the three that do not transmit are the roundworm, tapeworm, and threadworm. The six parasites may arise from poisonous substances within the organs or may be transmitted through familial habits. At the onset of these ailments, one may experience confusion of spirit and imbalances in qi. It is essential to refrain from indulgence in wine and lust and to regulate one’s diet carefully.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>If it is otherwise, with five hearts troubled and heated, and experiencing night sweats and palpitations, after ten days one will become emaciated, with a sallow complexion and a glossy appearance. This is the symptom. If one blindly trusts in false masters, prays and seeks blessings, and relies on inept doctors and their medications, the condition will worsen over time. Only then will one realize the severity of the illness. If not careful, fortune and misfortune may turn on a dime. After this person passes away, their brothers, descendants, and relatives will pass it down through generations, potentially leading to the extinction of their family. Generally speaking, within the phrase &#39;six worms&#39;, they circulate throughout four cavities, repeating in cycles. The disease occurs when the wood qi is met, beginning to take hold a day after the start of spring, feasting every three days and retreating every five days, causing suffering and pain throughout the body. As for the &#39;food&#39; of the worms, when they retreat, they return to their cavities and deeply sleep, intoxicated for five days, giving the appearance of temporary tranquility. It is only when they awaken that one may use charms and medication. Otherwise, if the worms are still deeply asleep under charms and medicine, healing cannot occur. One worm occupies twelve holes in the body, and six worms together occupy seventy-two holes.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>In the first ten days of the month, with the insect&#39;s head facing upward, it travels through four points from the heart to the head; in the middle ten days, with the insect&#39;s head facing inward, it moves through four points from the heart to the navel; in the last ten days, with the insect&#39;s head facing downward, it traverses four points from the navel to the feet. The nature of the insect is already spiritualized, and it is essential to be precise in examination. If one collects the insect without replenishing, it indicates a shallow understanding and reckless behavior, merely wasting resources and ultimately failing to alleviate one’s illness—how tragic this is! The master said: To treat those exhausted by the influx of possession, one must first understand that the righteous and toxic energies coexist; therefore, when the organs become congested, they take on the form of insects. On sunny days, male insects grow longer, while on cloudy days, female insects do. They initially consume the fats of the organs, hence their white color. When the five organs and six entrails are depleted from being consumed, the skin gathers and hair falls out; for women, their menstrual cycles stop; blood vessels are all damaged, and they cannot nourish the five organs and six entrails. After seventy days, when they have consumed all the human blood and flesh, the insects become yellow and red; due to the damage to the muscles, they become emaciated and unable to sustain skin and flesh, and the tendons weaken and cannot hold firm.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>After one hundred and twenty days, when flesh and blood have been consumed, the worms turn purple, and they begin to feed on essence; transmitted into the kidneys, they then appear black. Feeding on marrow leads to bone atrophy, making it impossible for one to rise from bed. When the worms exist for a long time, they grow hair, which has a mottled color, drawing in the energies of the five organs and five elements, and when transmitted to three individuals, they can fly, resembling birds with many varieties. Once they enter the kidney meridian, they cannot be treated. According to the texts, taking effective medicine after the worms appear, if the worms are white, one can take medicine for thirty days to supplement; if they are yellow or red, one can take medicine for sixty days; if they are purple or black, the disease has reached its limit, and one can take medicine for one hundred and twenty days to supplement. Furthermore, it is said: if the worms have a red head, they feed on the flesh of the afflicted person, and one can treat them; if the head and mouth are white, they feed on the marrow of the afflicted person, making the illness difficult to treat, and it is best to cut it off thereafter. Thus, the text states: within sixty days, those who treat have a success rate of seven or eight out of ten; within eighty days, the success drops to three or four out of ten. Beyond this period, it is unknown whether one can recover completely, but it may help remove harm for one&#39;s descendants. Now, based on the transmission from six generations, the conditions and symptoms of these worms are detailed below.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>First Generation of Worm-like Illness Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>The worms resemble infants, about three inches long, with hair on their backs. They may take the form of spirits moving within the organs or resemble shrimp (insect hemp), shifting within the viscera. After being afflicted, individuals feel immediately weak, experience disturbed dreams, their spirits seem to fly away, and their energy becomes scattered. They eat less, appear gradually thinner, suffer pain in limbs and joints, dislike cold and feel overheated, experience tightness in the back, have a bitter mouth and dry tongue, show no color in the face, and have a runny nose with frequent copious sweat. The worms awaken on days of Bing and Ding, drunkenly returning to the heart&#39;s source points, with cycles repeating. Treatment can only commence once the worms are thoroughly intoxicated. After removal of the worms, tonify the heart, and it is advisable to take Shou Ling Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Second Generation of Worm-like Illness Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>The worms appear like tangled hair, approximately three inches long, or resemble centipedes, lizards, or shrimp and crabs, all found within human organs. Symptoms from this worm-induced illness include a drunken appearance, ominous dreams involving deceased relatives, a feeling of heaviness in the chest, discord in the limbs, brittle bones, gradual weakness, sour ascension from the stomach, dry throat with nasal congestion, back pain, weakness in the lower back and knees, expectoration of purulent blood, head and eyes feeling unwell, and phlegm in the chest with night sweats and fever. The worms awaken on days of Geng and Shen, drunkenly returning to the lung source points, and treatment can only commence once the worms are thoroughly intoxicated. After removal of the worms, tonifying the lungs aids recovery, and it is advisable to take Xu Cheng Powder.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>Third Generation Treatment Method for Insect-like Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The insects resemble mosquitoes and ants, or resemble mantises, or appear as fragments of blood, or like hedgehogs, or like caterpillars, residing within the internal organs of the human body. Those suffering from this condition may exhibit symptoms such as dizziness in the three warmer regions, excessive drowsiness throughout the day, vomiting of bitter bile or clear water mixed with phlegm, abdominal distension and intestinal sounds, sores in the mouth and nose, black lips and a blue complexion, gradual weight loss, mental confusion, dry mouth and throat, and excessive tears. These insects emerge on the Gengyin day of the lunar calendar, intoxicated, returning to the four acupoints of the Jueyin channel. Once the insects become greatly intoxicated, treatment can begin. After the insects are expelled, replenishing Qi will lead to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Generation Treatment Method for Insect-like Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The insects appear like tangled threads, or like grubs, or resemble pig liver or lungs, or like cicadas, or like snakes, moving within the five internal organs. Those afflicted with these insects may experience disturbances in their internal organs, vomiting, obstruction or gas accumulation in the intestines, aversion to cold and intense heat, a distended abdomen with taut muscles, coughing accompanied by shortness of breath, a bitter mouth and dry tongue, and a craving for sour and salty foods. These insects emerge on the Wujiyi day of the lunar calendar, intoxicated, returning to the four acupoints of the Spleen. Once the insects become greatly intoxicated, treatment can begin. After the insects are expelled, replenishing the Spleen will lead to recovery, and it is advisable to take Hun Ting San (an herbal formula).<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>Fifth Generation Treatment Method for Worm-like Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The worm resembles a hairless rat, or may have a head without limbs, or limbs without a head, or looks like fragments of essence and blood. Those suffering from this worm find it enters the liver meridian and returns to the kidneys, transforming upon encountering blood. This results in excessive anger, limb weakness, decreased appetite, and the face may appear flushed like a healthy person. Some may occasionally speak of future events while in a trance, or be bedridden with symptoms resembling a stroke, experiencing numbness and abdominal pain. The worm arises during the solar eclipses on the days of Ren and Gui, becoming intoxicated in the four Liver Shu points. Only when the worm is thoroughly intoxicated can it be treated. After extracting the worm, nourishing the liver will lead to recovery; it is advisable to take Jinming San.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth Generation Treatment Method for Worm-like Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The worm possesses wings and limbs, often referred to as &quot;flying corpses,&quot; resembling a horse’s tail, sometimes with two, one male and one female, or like a tortoise, found within the five organs of a person, resembling rotten surface or birds, either long or short. Those afflicted by this worm will experience an insatiable desire for food, physical weakness, lack of strength in the waist and knees, dim eyesight, tinnitus, and irregular coughing. The worm arises during the solar eclipses on the days of Chou and Hai, becoming intoxicated in the four Kidney Shu points. Only when the worm is thoroughly intoxicated can it be treated. After extracting the worm, nourishing the kidneys and replenishing the marrow will lead to recovery; it is advisable to take Yuying San.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br><strong>On the Transmission of Corpse Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>It is said: Generally, the signs of the transmission of corpse symptoms manifest as a feeling of fullness and discomfort in the chest, pain in the arms, unclear vision, weakness in the extremities, and despite the desire to sleep, one often cannot. There is sharp pain in the back, pain in the waist and knees, a tendency to lie down excessively while seldom getting up, presenting a condition resembling feigned illness. Every morning, the spirit seems intact, appearing as if one is well; however, after midday, the body feels slightly warm and the face lacks color. There is joy in seeing people pass by, yet one often harbors suppressed anger, remaining dissatisfied, leading to frequent irritability. The legs feel weak when standing or walking, there is night sweating during sleep, dreams involving spirits, encounters with the deceased, or numerous frightening experiences. At times, there may be shortness of breath or coughing. Although there is an urge for food, one cannot eat much; death might occur unexpectedly while the spirit lingers. Occasionally, there may be mild benefits, a feeling of emptiness and bloating in the sides, dry mouth and nose, excessive sticky saliva, an occasional desire for sleep, and a growing sense of weakness, similar to a dried fish that fails to perceive its death. Furthermore, it is noted: The symptoms of corpse transmission arise without discernible cause, and it matters not if one is old or young, male or female; all may suffer from this affliction.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>Generally, the five elements interact with and counteract each other, first transmitting toxic gas internally, spreading throughout the five organs, gradually causing heat and emaciation until death occurs. After death, it further spreads to a family member, hence called &quot;transmitting the corpse&quot; or &quot;transmitting illness.&quot; Since it initially presents as half lying down and half sitting up, it is referred to as &quot;the state of sickness.&quot; Those who experience coughing breath are called &quot;lung wasting disease.&quot; Bone and marrow pain accompanied by internal heat is known as &quot;bone steaming.&quot; When it transmits to the five organs, it is called &quot;hidden connection.&quot; If treatment is not resolved, it may lead to extinction of the family. When men and women suffer from weakness, it is referred to as &quot;exhaustion.&quot; In Wu and Chu, it is named &quot;dripping,&quot; and in Ba and Shu, it is also called &quot;exhaustion.&quot; Its origin first arises from the kidneys; at first, the energy causes the legs to feel sore, the lower back stiff, with weakness in standing and walking, diminished appetite, a whistling sound in both ears resembling wind, nighttime leakage, and weakness with sweating. Once the kidneys are affected, it next transmits to the heart. When the heart initially receives the energy, it causes nighttime panic, frequent palpitations, a feeling of suffocation, and dreams of those who have passed away. Sometimes it leads to night sweats, tastelessness in food, sores in the mouth, a hot and irritable heart, a strong desire to sleep, feeling light in the morning and heavy in the evening, with both cheeks and lips appearing red as if painted with rouge, and at times, the hands and feet feel hot and restless.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>Once the heart has been affected, it is next transmitted to the lungs. The lungs, upon initially receiving the air, may induce coughing, with a slight pain in the breath, occasional shortness of breath that worsens when lying down, dryness in the nose and mouth, an inability to smell fragrances or odors, and when there are sudden scents, only the unpleasant smell of decay is perceived. Sometimes there may be nausea, a feeling of impending vomiting, dry skin that may hurt intermittently, or sensations like insects crawling, with dry, thin skin resembling flour sheets. Once the lungs are affected, the condition moves to the liver. The liver, upon initially receiving the air, presents with dull eyes, a pale face, a tendency to frown, limited vision, dry eyes, occasional redness and pain in the eyes, a persistent feeling of heaviness leading to a desire to close the eyes and sleep, yet often struggling to maintain sleep. Once the liver is affected, the condition shifts to the spleen. The spleen, initially receiving the air, leads to a feeling of emptiness and bloating in the sides, indigestion of food, occasional diarrhea, possibly resulting in water and grain becoming parasitic, and at times abdominal pain with rumbling in the belly, dry and cracked lips or sores, dry hair that lacks luster, occasional shortness of breath with shoulder tension, bloody diarrhea with blackish fluid. If such symptoms are observed, they are deemed untreatable.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>There are various ailments such as bone steaming, sudden death, recurring illnesses, corpse-related conditions, insect-related ailments, toxic influences, heat-related sicknesses, cold-related illnesses, food-related disorders, and ghost-related afflictions, all referred to as &quot;transmitted illnesses&quot; due to their similar manifestations in the sick. These conditions arise from above, resembling each other, hence termed “illness.” There are approximately twenty-two, thirty-six, or even ninety-nine variations. Generally, they lead to symptoms of cold, heat, and sweat theft, dreams involving spirits, nocturnal emissions, dry and erect hair, abdominal lumps, small nodules on either side of the head, recurring clusters, whether gathered or scattered, heavy and silent conditions, coughing up phlegm, purulent blood resembling lung tuberculosis or lung abscesses, or recurring dysentery, leading to emaciation and fatigue, overwhelming individuals until death occurs, which may also be transmitted after death, easily affecting family members, leading sometimes to the extinction of a household. Furthermore, there are ailments involving flying insects, evasion of corpses, cold corpses, loss of life, and corpse-related illnesses referred to as the “five corpses,” along with signs of minor and major afflictions. Without knowing the source of suffering, there is no escape from evil, and these ailments may involve various malevolent spirits, causing complex symptoms that are difficult to predict. Thus, from ancient times to the present, only one in ten recover from these diseases. The so-called remedies like badger bones, otter livers, heavenly lids, and copper locks for the nose are merely spoken of and have yet to show any efficacy. Only the methods targeting the &quot;Gao Huang&quot; and the &quot;Cui&quot; acupoints, if treated promptly with moxibustion, may offer some hope; delaying treatment yields little benefit.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br><strong>On the Heat from Yin Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In the world, there are various types of febrile diseases akin to typhoid, and their treatments differ. For typhoid, cold-induced ailments, and cold epidemics, the methods of Zhongjing are used; for warm diseases and plagues, those of Hejian are employed. These discuss exterior pathogenic influences. Nowadays, when people see a fever, they immediately diagnose it as typhoid and generally use sweating medications to release the exterior. If the fever does not resolve after sweating, they then employ exterior-cooling medicines like Chaihu, Liangge, Baihu, and Shuangle. If this is a deficiency syndrome, is this not perilous? Emerging from Dongyuan’s theory, the discussion centers on internal injuries and the supplementation of qi. This use of qi tonics addresses the insufficiency of qi. As for indulging in excessive thinking and sexual desires, it can harm the true yin; when the true yin is depleted, the yang has nothing to rely on, thus it also causes fever. Such individuals will surely have flushed faces, irritability, thirst, pain in the bones, and rapid, strong pulses; some may have a weak and slow pulse. Danxi elucidated the principle of nourishing yin, using a concoction of the Four Substance Decoction with Huangbai and Zhimu, thereby employing blood tonics to replenish the deficiency of blood. Why do common practices often yield no effect? It is because the concept of yin is misunderstood, confusing blood for yin.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>When considering the true yin within the kidneys, this refers to the original essence. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: those who are cold and then heated tend to draw from yin, while those who are hot and then cold tend to draw from yang; this is what is meant by seeking its true nature. Mr. Wang Taifu notes: great cold yet vibrant, heated without heat, signifies an absence of fire; great heat yet vibrant, cold without cold, signifies an absence of water. He further notes: sudden back-and-forth, at times appearing and at times stopping, indicates an absence of fire; appearing by day and hidden by night, revealed again by day, moving with the seasons, indicates an absence of water. Therefore, one must seek its true nature and govern it. Where there is no fire, one should nourish the source of fire to dispel the obscuring yin; where there is no water, one should strengthen the master of water to settle the yang light. It is essential to use the Six Flavors and Eight Flavors pills, adjusting their intake to replenish the true yin, yielding repeated effectiveness. However, following theories of bitter cold substances like mud yellow bracken and Anemarrhena may lead to damage of the spleen yin and numerous consequences. As a general principle, when illness presents as heat causing thirst, and drinking cold leads to constipation, this signifies true heat, which is widely recognized. Conversely, when one experiences aversion to cold with fever, pulling clothes tightly and curling up, with limbs feeling cold and clear stools, this indicates true cold, which is also easily recognized.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>As for the disturbances of extreme heat and restlessness, where one does not wish to wear clothes and desires to sit or lie in mud and water, this indicates a false heat condition. In severe cases, there is intense agitation, incessant thirst, a tongue like a thorn, dry and cracked lips, a face resembling red paint, the body feeling as if burned, soles of the feet feeling as if seared, expectoration resembling a surge, labored breathing, constipation, and painful urination, with the three pulse positions large and chaotic. At this time, it resembles the symptoms of purgation syndrome, where purgation leads to immediate danger; it also resembles the symptoms of the White Tiger syndrome, where ingestion leads to demise. If using mere pills, the condition will not improve. Instead, one must urgently prepare a modified Eight Flavor Formula, with one pound of ingredients, including one tael of cinnamon, boiled with water to make five or six bowls, and given chilled for drinking; all symptoms will subside. The next day, one must fear a cold pulse deficit, indicating lack of fire, thus needing to replenish Yang urgently with Aconite Eight Flavor Pills to recover. This condition and pulse deviate from the norm, and one must not treat it with conventional methods. In cases following childbirth or significant blood loss, where Yin blood is severely damaged, one will inevitably experience intense fever, also known as Yin deficiency fever; the term &quot;Yin&quot; here specifically refers to the Yin of Qi and blood.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>If a person is treated with cool herbs and inevitably dies, it is just like the case with the Bai Hu Decoction; taking Bai Hu Decoction will certainly lead to death. At such a time, one must not use Si Wu Decoction. The reason is that the physical blood cannot be transformed quickly, while the ethereal essence requires urgent reinforcement. One must use Du Shen Decoction or Dang Gui Blood Supplement Decoction to ensure the formless gives birth to the form. This is the subtle use of Yang giving birth to Yin and must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>Someone might ask: Your discussion is detailed. Both Qi deficiency and blood deficiency are internal injuries; how do you differentiate them? I respond: Your question is entirely appropriate! Indeed, if Yin is deficient, the face must be red, indicating a rootless fire above. If it is a Yang syndrome, the fire would enter within, and the face would not be red. If there is thirst, it means the kidney water is depleted, and one craves water as a means of self-rescue. However, though the mouth is thirsty, the tongue must be slippery, and although the pulse may be rapid, the pulse at the wrist must lack strength. In severe cases, even if the pulse at the wrist is strong and rapid, pressing it will not yield a hearty beat; this is how to differentiate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if one questions a person who has taken cool herbs and finds that the pulse is strong and buoyant, it indicates accumulated fire; they should be lifted and supplemented, carefully avoiding coldness as violating this will certainly lead to death. Practitioners at the bedside should further differentiate with care; a slight mistake could cost someone their life. Be cautious! Be cautious!<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The signs of deficiency caused by exertion are described in the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; under blood stagnation, indicating that exertion must harm one&#39;s essence and blood. When the nutritive blood is harmed, internal heat arises, leading to a constant feeling of heat in the five hearts, visions of flowers and fire in the eyes, croaking of frogs and chirping of cicadas in the ears, deterioration of the tongue and mouth, loss of taste, dryness of the nostrils, and difficulty in breathing. This results in food not benefiting the skin, lethargy and excessive sleeping, weak bones and sore feet, slow movement of the nutritive qi, and rapid movement of the defensive qi, as the nutritive blood is pressured by the defensive qi, unable to remain inside and instead escapes outside—either through vomiting or nosebleeds, or from the two lower orifices. When blood loss is significant and fiery heat rushes in relentlessly, the suffering is unending; when the nutritive blood is entirely depleted, what is left but death? </p>
<p>Moreover, there are cases where extreme exertion leads to stagnation without blood loss; here, blood does not escape outside but is merely accumulated within. Over time, this stagnation prevents normal flow throughout the body&#39;s blood vessels, leading to dryness and a lack of vitality in the skin, devoid of luster and moisture. Thus, where the qi flows, the blood remains unmoved, merely accumulating heat as steam, either during the day or at noon, causing intense dryness and heat. Once the steam disperses, a slight sweat may relieve the heat, but if the steam persists, illness may worsen—what more is needed but death? There are also cases where blood is initially lost, later leading to stagnation; when blood is deficient and scarce, circulation becomes difficult, and heat induces stagnation, which is particularly easy to develop. </p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; speaks of deficiency diseases without addressing exertion. Yet, when large amounts of meat become shriveled, when major bones sink, when the qi in the chest rises, and when the five organs each show signs of danger, this too has been well noted.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>When there is no extreme exhaustion, the true organs and pulses may not be visible. However, when withered and depleted to the utmost, indeed the true organs and pulses will not be seen; could there be anyone who does not die? The Qin Yue people began to discuss the theory of deficiency, stating that when one is deficient and encounters cold, it depletes the yang. When the yang is deficient, the yin becomes excessive, leading to damage that descends from above. First, damage to the lungs causes the skin to gather, leading to hair loss; second, damage to the heart prevents the blood vessels from nourishing the organs; third, damage to the stomach results in food not benefiting the skin. Conversely, when deficient and encountering heat, it depletes the yin, and when the yin is deficient, the yang becomes excessive, leading to damage that ascends from below. First, damage to the kidneys causes weakness in the bones, preventing one from getting out of bed; second, damage to the liver causes the tendons to loosen, making it unable to contract; third, damage to the spleen prevents food from being digested.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>Those who approach from above, if they overindulge in food, cannot be cured; those who approach from below, if they neglect the spleen, also cannot be cured. This is because excessive eating can naturally produce blood, while insufficient eating means blood cannot be generated. Without the production of blood, the yin cannot adequately support the yang, leading to damage to all five organs. The people of Yue emphasize the importance of the spleen and stomach—how insightful this is! Regarding Zhongjing, the texts of the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; summarize its main ideas, stating that essence is produced from grain, and if grain intake is low, blood will not be produced, thus the blood cannot transform into essence. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if there is insufficient essence, it must be replenished with flavors. Flavors refer to the tastes of the five grains. By supplementing with flavors and moderating effort, the reserves gradually become abundant, and great misfortune is avoided. If one uses a small mouth of a chicken for the output of a large cow, can one expect it to not become weak? Thus, the ten teachings emphasize the dual deficiency of vital energy and blood in healthy men, illustrating the signs of deficiency labor as clear as a finger pointing.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>Men, in their pursuit of desires, often overlook the loss of essence. They indulge without recognizing that their vitality diminishes daily. Their food loses flavor, and as they grow weary, they also grow weaker. This cycle of labor and exhaustion affects their pulse, their complexion lacks luster, and their bodily fluids decrease, leading to thirst and diminished urination. In severe cases, they may experience blurred vision, nosebleeds, and involuntary emissions; they sweat profusely and tremble, filled with fear and anxiety. When the blood fails to transform into essence, it leads to blood stagnation. This stagnation prevents the generation of new blood and causes the already existing blood to become stagnant and uncirculated. As blood stagnates, the nutrients become deficient, resulting in fever. Prolonged heat then steams the stagnated blood, transforming it into parasites, ultimately leading to consumptive illnesses. Extreme conditions exhaust a person&#39;s vitality, nourishing the parasites; when a person dies, the parasites also perish.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>The wandering souls that do not die are said to be connected to a lineage of ancestors, attached to the blood pathways, appearing as if they exist and yet do not. Subsequently, the worms thrive and grow, while humanity withers over time. After three generations, the essence of the worm becomes spiritual; it cannot be controlled by talismans or medicines. </p>
<p>When the physician He examined Duke Ping of Jin&#39;s illness, he said: it is due to being close to women’s quarters, concealed and resulting in internal heat causing bewildering ailments; it is neither ghost nor food, and cannot be treated. The &#39;bewilderment&#39; refers to sores on the lower lip, and worms consuming the rectum, which is called the &#39;bewilderment worm&#39; (the original text had &quot;或虫,&quot; but was corrected according to &quot;Medical Laws,&quot; volume six, on hypochondria). </p>
<p>The term for &#39;worm&#39; here signifies that three worms inhabit one vessel; it is neither ghost nor food, explicitly indicating the malevolence of the worm, not avoiding mention for the sake of the noble. Hence, the symptoms of fox bewilderment include hoarseness and huskiness, and the symptoms of consumption also include hoarseness and huskiness; this indicates that when the voice is hoarse, the trachea is gnawed by the worm. </p>
<p>The lessons of past failures in men are innumerable, with countless billions across the ages.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>The text discusses the views of the Chao family in &quot;Sources of Illness,&quot; which mistakenly identifies various conditions such as consumption, steaming illnesses, and obstructive diseases. It categorizes labor into five types of exhaustion, six extremes, and seven injuries; steaming into five types and twenty-four varieties; and obstruction into thirty-six or ninety-nine kinds, each with different treatments. Consequently, later generations faced confusion due to the multitude of paths available, leaving them unsure of what to follow. They even referred to it as phlegm and fire, leading to misguided notions about phlegm and fire being either deficient or excessive, resulting in an abundance of prescriptions that misapply treatments for lung deficiency and lung excess, as well as for the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. This led to the erroneous addition of real damage to the discussion of deficiency and exhaustion, displaying a lamentable ignorance. Zhang Zhongjing cautioned men about the importance of nourishing and protecting one&#39;s vitality, emphasizing that grains are treasures. By continually regulating nourishment and safeguarding one&#39;s essence, one ensures longevity. One should accumulate energy firmly and practice moderation in desires to sustain this essence. When illness first manifests and the pulse begins to show signs, relying on the principles of regulating the center and restoring the pulse becomes the primary treatment.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The methods of Jianzhong and Fumai are both excellent remedies for cultivating sweetness in crops. They adhere to the principle that what is lacking in essence must be supplemented by flavor. How could it be that the spring has dried up without the principle being understood? Those who follow the remedies for kidney supplementation in later generations, along countless paths, in treating deficiency and fatigue, rarely achieve completeness. Is it not merely copying others and providing empty talk? When the blood stagnates and does not flow, Zhongjing urgently seeks to drive out the old and generate the new, hoping to catch the moment before fatigue and illness fully develop. There may indeed be profound methods, but common practices cannot apply them. Observe how a young person&#39;s organs are delicate. With a mere accumulation of cold and heat, it becomes easy for them to develop lumps and consumptive lesions. Once blood stagnates and does not flow, and vitality vaporizes with heat, intervention becomes impossible. For women, if the blood is deficient and the menses cease, and fever persists, the signs of fatigue and illness become more pronounced. Waiting until this condition solidifies, even with effective methods, they cannot be treated. If only one could internalize the wisdom of Zhongjing and the ancients, striving at the threshold of sickness in men, women, and children, before it fully manifests, the ability to restore life would be like raising the bones of the deceased to give them life again, all dependent on the concern of the heavens.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br><strong>On Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of deficiency in &quot;Xu Lao&quot; (虚劳, Xu syndrome) reflects an insufficiency, as it indicates an internal loss of essence and energy, contrasting the solid pulse from external pathogenic influences. The Yellow Emperor asked, what is &quot;heavy deficiency&quot;? Qi Bo replied that it refers to the pulse being weak, with both the superficial and deep aspects being deficient. When the qi is deficient, it is said to be irregular, meaning the pulse is without consistency. When the pulse is weak, it indicates unstable movement, suggesting that one’s gait is unsteady. The weak pulse does not resemble the fullness of the Taiyin pulse in the hand; this concept is easy to understand. </p>
<p>The irregularity of the pulse has traditionally been attributed to a deficiency of Yang energy in the upper jiao, resulting in an unstable pulse. If this is the case, then a deficiency of Yin energy in the lower jiao leads to even greater irregularities. The subsequent text states that a slippery pulse indicates vitality, while a choppy pulse suggests death. A choppy pulse signifies that death is imminent, and if the cun pulse is also irregular, how can it signify life? Therefore, the term referring to qi deficiency indicates irregularity. This specifically points to the artery under the left breast. </p>
<p>Where there is regularity, the ancestral qi is not deficient; where there is irregularity, the ancestral qi is greatly deficient, and thus the qi of the upper jiao becomes increasingly insufficient. Later discussions on pulse diagnosis neglect this subtlety, merely refining upon the observations of previous scholars regarding the pulse, asserting that a soft pulse is deficient, a slow pulse indicates deficiency, a stagnant pulse suggests deficiency, a wiry pulse indicates a moderate deficiency, and a thin pulse suggests both blood and qi are deficient. A small pulse suggests low blood and qi, while a heavy, small, and delayed pulse indicates an escape of qi.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>The pulse of deficiency and damage can be summarized in a few words, yet it cannot fully express its depth. It is thanks to Zhongjing that it has been named &quot;deficiency labor.&quot; The pulse of deficiency labor is often characterized by being floating and large, which should be considered alongside whether it is floating and large in previous discussions on pulse. Therefore, it is said: a man with a large, floating pulse indicates labor, and extreme deficiency also indicates labor. Moreover, a floating pulse suggests internal deficiency. It is stated that the illness of labor presents a floating and large pulse, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet, worsening in spring and summer, but recovering in autumn and winter. A man with a floating, weak, and slack pulse may suffer from infertility. If the pulse is knotted and slightly tense, it suggests the man has lost essence or that a woman dreams of unions. An extremely weak and slack pulse may indicate loss of essence due to depletion of blood. A weak and thin pulse is conducive to spontaneous sweating. In summary, it is stated: a pulse that is tight and large signifies reduction; a large pulse indicates vacuity; reduction signifies coldness; and vacuity indicates deficiency. When deficiency and cold combat each other, this is termed as &quot;reform.&quot; For women, this can lead to abnormal discharge after childbirth; for men, it implies loss of blood and essence. It is evident that a large and floating pulse appears well outwardly but actually hides a lack internally. One cannot escape the nuances beneath the fingers, and the symptoms of diseases cannot help but reflect back in one&#39;s chest. Zhongjing&#39;s continuance from the past to the present is not merely casual. Though I, Chang, may be foolish and incapable, I have placed the discussion of vital energy at the scroll&#39;s beginning, elaborating the significance concerning the essence and energy of the chest. This was in response to Qibo&#39;s indication of the pulse as being vacuous, highlighting the importance of recognizing the severity of the vacuous pulse; the essence beneath the breast certainly warrants diagnosis. Thus, the indications may be expressed beneath the hall, yet it is not necessarily endorsed by those above, but one cannot dismiss it as a novice outside the door.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>　　　　　Mixed Discussions</p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states: When the form and qi are both insufficient, it is inadequate to use acupuncture. If one were to puncture despite this deficiency, it would exhaust both yin and yang, leading to a depletion of qi and blood, emptying of the five organs, and withering of the bones and marrow. The elderly would be completely extinguished, and the young would not recover. The &quot;form&quot; refers to the physical body; &quot;qi&quot; refers to the breath inhaled through the mouth and nose. When the physical body diminishes, those who appear strong and robust are starkly different. When breathing is labored and short, insufficient to sustain life, it is distinctly different from someone whose body and energy are not hurried by toil. Insufficient pathogenic qi leads to lethargy and weakness, indicating a deficiency of the righteous qi inside, markedly different from external evils that darken the spirit and cause an increase in symptoms. In such cases, acupuncture should not be employed; instead, one should supplement it with sweet herbs. Sweet herbs are used to nourish and support the center, providing good medicine to nourish the organs and enable the circulation of blood. This method is strictly observed by Zhongjing; others like Dongyuan and Danxi also follow this principle. However, Dongyuan corroborates it with internal injuries rather than external influences, while Danxi supports it in cases of yin deficiency, not addressing the loss of yang. This distinction is the weight of the learned and the worthy within the sacred domain.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>The people of Qin and Yue invented a theory of deficiency and damage, granted access to the sacred domain. Although there are no specific texts to consult, their methods for treating deficiencies involve: for lung deficiency, enhancing qi; for heart deficiency, regulating the flow of nourishment and defense; for spleen deficiency, adjusting diet according to cold and heat; for liver deficiency, alleviating internal issues; and for kidney deficiency, enriching essence. This is indeed the essence of the rightful teachings. If the eighty-one difficulties are all treated in this manner, what concern is there that future generations will lack resources?</p>
<p>The original qi deficiency differs from damage due to deficiency; original qi deficiency can be restored, while damage is difficult to recover from. There are also two types of deficiency diseases: those caused by illness leading to deficiency can recover with gentle adjustments, whereas those where deficiency leads to damage result in compounding deficiencies, making recovery extremely difficult.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Therefore, when illness leads to deficiency, the methods of Dongyuan and Danxi are essential; if deficiency accumulates further, it will result in damage, and the original qi will be profoundly depleted. Danxi often uses ginseng paste up to ten or more pounds, with many recovering, which seems to align closely with Dongyuan’s approach. Thus, Danxi&#39;s theory of nourishing yin is merely addressing the tendency of saving people to be overly focused on nourishing yang; how could one encounter yang deficiency and not find relief through rotation (of treatments)?</p>
<p>Diet and overexertion are the causes of internal injury to original qi, resulting in true yang descending and the internal generation of vacuous heat. The theory of Shuyang enhancing middle qi recommends the use of herbs like ginseng and astragalus, which are sweet and warm, to greatly replenish qi and elevate what has fallen—this is the use of qi tonics to replenish what is deficient in qi. On the other hand, if one exhausts their mind with passions, injuring true yin, the yin blood will be harmed, leading to an excess of yang qi that transforms into fire; this is termed the syndrome of yin deficiency and excess fire, which manifests as chronic fatigue or consumption.</p>
<p>Hence, Danxi’s theory on excess yang and insufficient yin proposes using Siwu Decoction, supplemented with Zhimu and Huangbai, to replenish yin, thereby reducing fire; this is the application of blood tonics to replenish what is deficient in blood.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>To benefit qi and nourish yin, one method addresses the descent of yang qi to replenish it for elevation, while the other deals with the ascent of yang fire to nourish yin for descent. The elevation and descent are distinctly different, representing two major approaches in medicine that must be thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>Danxi discusses that labor and consumption are primarily due to yin deficiency. From the Zi (Rat) to Si (Snake) hours is yang, and from Wu (Horse) to Hai (Pig) is yin. When yin is deficient, heat appears from late morning to early night; wakefulness is yang and sleep is yin, leading to sweating that happens at night due to yin deficiency; elevation is yang and descent is yin, so if yin is deficient, the qi does not descend, causing phlegm and fluids to rise endlessly; a floating pulse is yang and a deep pulse is yin, with yin deficiency leading to a floating pulse that is large and a deep pulse that is empty. These are all signs of yin deficiency, treated with the Si Wu Decoction, augmented with Huangbo and Zhimu.</p>
<p>However, frequent use is ineffective; why is that? It is because the yin is already deficient, causing the fire to flare up. Angelica and Chuanxiong both have warming properties and are not suitable for nourishing yin and descending fire. Moreover, Chuanxiong&#39;s upward movement is particularly inappropriate for those suffering from a deficiency of fire. Rehmannia mud obstructs the diaphragm and is unsuitable for those with stomach heat and excessive phlegm. Huangbo and Zhimu, though described as nourishing yin, actually have a drying effect and harm blood; even though they claim to descend fire, their bitterness first enters the heart, which over time increases qi, thereby potentially supporting fire until it damages the stomach, which goes without saying.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>It is better to use ingredients such as coix seed, lily, tian dong (asparagus), mai dong (ophiopogon), mulberry bark, earth bone peel, peony root, loquat leaves, schisandra, and sour jujube seed, along with fresh juice of rehmannia, lotus root, human milk, and children&#39;s urine. If there is a cough, emphasize mulberry bark and loquat leaves; if there is phlegm, increase fritillaria; if there is blood, use more coix seed and lily, and increase ejiao (donkey-hide gelatin); if there is a strong heat, use more earth bone peel; if there is little food intake, use coix seed up to seven or eight qian. Mai dong is often the main ingredient, as it preserves the lung&#39;s essence and nourishes the source of transformation, often yielding quick results. All these medicines possess a drying, descending, and astringent nature; those with a lighter energy are the yin within the yang, where light energy leads to release. The flavors are pungent, sweet, bland, neutral, and cool.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>For treating the symptoms of yin deficiency and active fire, one should administer remedies especially during the oppressive heat of summer. When a sudden cold wind arises, it feels as if heat has been lost. This is similar to using Bai Hu Decoction for dealing with summer heat. However, that situation involves external pathogen invasion, which is considered excess, thus requiring cooling and suppressive medicine to balance it. In contrast, this condition stems from internal injury, characterized by deficiency, and can be addressed by using drying and descending agents to achieve equilibrium.</p>
<p>For the affliction of deficiency and exhaustion, where the hundred channels are vacuous, it cannot be remedied by filling them with thick and greasy substances. When essence and blood are depleted, they cannot be nourished without moistening agents. One should use ingredients such as Ren Shen (ginseng), Huang Qi (astragalus), Di Huang (rehmannia), the two Dong (winter herbs), Gou Qi (goji berries), and Wu Wei Zi (five-flavor fruit), each prepared as a thick decoction. Additionally, Qing Hao (sweet wormwood) can be boiled with child urine to make a concentrate, along with fresh juices from Di Huang (rehmannia), white lotus root, milk, and mint, processed separately and combined in appropriate amounts with antler glue and gossamer cream to form a cohesive remedy. Each time, one spoonful is to be dissolved in soup and taken.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>If you wish to move stagnant blood, add powdered rhubarb, Yuanming powder, peach kernel paste, and leek juice. To stop bleeding, add ingredients related to Jing ink. To resolve phlegm, add bamboo juice. To reduce fire, add childhood urine. </p>
<p>In general, the signs of deficiency and labor involve pain in the chest and ribs, due to stagnant blood not being dispelled and new blood unable to nourish it. It is especially suitable to use an ointment with leek juice and peach kernel paste. </p>
<p>Symptoms of shortness of breath, reluctance to speak, weak actions, lack of spirit in the eyes, and a pale complexion, all indicate qi deficiency. Use three taels each of Ophiopogon and ginseng, half a tael each of dried tangerine peel, balloon flower, and fried licorice, and twenty-one grains of schisandra ground into a very fine powder, mixed with water to form pills the size of a chick&#39;s head. Take one pill each time, chew it well with saliva before swallowing; this is called the Qi Tonifying Pill. </p>
<p>For qi deficiency, use the Shengmai Powder, excluding Bai Zhu; for blood deficiency, use the San Cai Pill, excluding Si Wu. The previously mentioned coix seed treats lung deficiency, while the later mentioned ginseng, astragalus, and Rehmannia ointment treat kidney deficiency. The liver and heart belong to yang, while the lungs and kidneys belong to yin; if yin is deficient, then the lungs and kidneys are also deficient. Therefore, nourishing the lungs and kidneys is synonymous with nourishing yin, which should not be confused with the Four Substances or ingredients like Huanglian and Zhimu. </p>
<p>In cases of consumption complicated with phlegm accumulation, characterized by constant heat in the abdomen and ribs, and occasional coolness in the head, face, hands, and feet during the yin and yang hours, it is advisable to use Xiatiang Ointment with bamboo juice, adding a bit of ginger juice and mixing in Yuanming powder to promote its effects.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>If stubborn phlegm is lodged in the diaphragm and is difficult to treat, it must be expelled using the vomiting method, or by administering pills like Shenxiang Guantan Wan or Toge Dan, and in severe cases, employing the倒仓 method. If the liver has accumulated phlegm and stagnant blood causing heat and fatigue, the Taichong pulse will surely be out of sync with the Chongyang pulse. Gui-yin herbs should be taken along with Danggui Longhui Wan. </p>
<p>Classic formulas such as Chaihu Yinzi, Fangfeng Danggui Yinzi, and Mai Jiansan all use Dahuang, which can reduce the inflamed condition and facilitate downward movement, achieving swift results. However, this is only applicable if the stool is firm. If there is diarrhea, even with herbs like Dihuang, it is inadvisable, let alone Dahuang.</p>
<p>There is a type of illness where the true internal organs are weakened and additionally affected by pathogenic heat. In such cases, formulas like Qinghao Jianwan with Chaihu are quite suitable. Once the heat is removed, urgent attention must be given; if there is no pathogenic heat, what need is there for treatment? Additionally, it is critical to avoid Qinko, Lian, and Puhuang, as abrupt use of purely bitter and cold herbs would further weaken yang. Instead, one should use classes like Qiongyu Gao to bolster yang energy and restore it to its rightful position while slightly adding herbs to drain yin fire.</p>
<p>In cases where heavy yin is restored and yang cannot extend, accompanied by chills, discontent, or a rapid wiry pulse with four limbs and five hearts feeling hot, one should use Huoyujing Tang or Chaihu Shengma Tang. The illness should cease promptly; one must not exceed the dosage.</p>
<p>When taking cold and cooling herbs, if symptoms have significantly decreased but the pulse has become more rapid, this indicates the repression of yang, thus it is necessary to help it rise and be replenished. Cold and cool substances are to be rigorously avoided, as transgressing them could lead to death.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>The treatment should focus on the spleen and kidneys, as the kidneys are the source of vital energy and the spleen nourishes the body. The classics say: &quot;When the body is deficient, it should be warmed by vital energy.&quot; This vital energy refers to the true qi, which has a mild warmth that nourishes the body. However, this warmth should not be allowed to become excessive; if it becomes too hot, it can strengthen the body but ultimately deplete the true qi. The excess warmth is found between the two kidneys. The classics further state: &quot;When essence is deficient, it should be replenished by flavors.&quot; The five flavors enter the stomach, each returning to their preferred organ to generate bodily fluids, which are then transported to the kidneys. If any flavor is taken in excess, it may lead to an excess in the organs, resulting in disharmony. The balance of the five flavors, initially affects the spleen and stomach, and then the organs they correspond to. One should replenish what is lacking and drain what is in excess, carefully maintaining the essence and energy, referring to yin and yang. Thus, when the heavenly pivot is opened, it leads to a harmonious stomach and the generation of veins.</p>
<p>In cases of long-term labor disease causing coughing blood and throat pain without sound, this indicates a transmission from below to above. If there is no cough or pain, but instead turbid urination and loss of essence over time, this indicates a transmission from above to below, both of which are signs of mortality.</p>
<p>The signs of transmitted illness for men begin with the kidneys, affecting the heart, then the lungs, then the liver, and finally the spleen. For women, it starts from the heart, affecting the lungs, then the liver, then the spleen, and then the kidneys. The five organs can also affect the six bowels, leading to death. Although various signs may appear, they ultimately do not stray from the yang of the heart and the yin of the kidneys. If one understands how to use medicine based on the principles of yin and yang, it can bring the dead back to life.</p>
<p>Su You Lun states: The signs of transmitted illness primarily originate from the kidneys.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>Upon first receiving it, the legs feel sore and painful, the waist and back are stiff, it’s weak to stand or walk, appetite decreases, and the ears whistle as if they hear the wind. At night, there are involuntary leaks, and there is a weakness with dampness. Once the kidneys are affected, the impact next reaches the heart. When the heart first receives the ailment, there are nighttime fears, or excessive terror; the heart feels anxious, breath shortens and seems close to exhaustion, dreams of the dead arise, sometimes accompanied by night sweats, tastelessness in food, mouth sores, a feeling of heat in the heart, a desire only to sleep, feeling light in the morning and heavy in the evening. The cheeks and lips are all marked red, like wearing rouge, and at times, the hands and feet feel hot and restless. Once the heart is affected, it then transfers to the lungs. When the lungs are first affected, there is coughing and wheezing, worsening at night, dryness in the nose and mouth, not able to smell anything—only detecting a foul odor, sometimes nausea and a desire to vomit, skin becoming dry, occasionally feeling pain, resembling insects crawling, with the skin wrinkled and dry like flaky dough. Once the lungs are affected, it then transmits to the liver. Initially, the liver shows symptoms with the eyes appearing hollow, the face lacking color, often frowning, unable to see far, the eyes always dry, sometimes red and painful, or the whites turning yellow, with a constant desire to close the eyes and difficulty sleeping. Once the liver is affected, it then moves to the spleen. Initially, the spleen shows weakness in the sides, poor digestion of food, sometimes leading to diarrhea, with water and grain producing worms, and sometimes belly pain, swelling, and rumbling in the abdomen, dry and scorched lips, or sores and swelling, hair becoming dry and lackluster, and sometimes feeling short of breath, shoulders feeling heavy and labored; if these symptoms appear, then it is regarded as untreatable.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br><strong>On Formulas</strong></p>
<p>According to the Tianxiong Powder, one formula uses Guizhi Decoction to regulate the nutritive and defensive qi; when the pulse is weak and deficient, add Longgu and Muli to stop the clear fluids, causing loss of blood and essence. With one formula addressing both essential points, it is indeed valuable. The &quot;Xiaopin&quot; also states: for those with deficiency, emaciation, floating heat, and sweating, remove Guizhi and add Bawei and Fuzhu, each three fen, hence it is called the Erjia Longgu Decoction. Understanding this method of addition and subtraction is already a significant step for future practitioners of this formula. </p>
<p>It can be seen that while Guizhi primarily regulates the nutritive and defensive qi, if a person has floating yang deficiency, one should indeed add Fuzhu and Bawei to restore the yang and assist in retaining the clear fluids, making Guizhi no longer necessary. The latter formula, focusing on the yang deficiency in the upper and middle jiao, must use Tianxiong to replenish the upper part, and Baizhu to secure the middle, employing Guizhi to lead the herbs, facilitating the nutritive and defensive qi in the upper jiao while also having the function of restoring yang. Although the lower section does not mention evidence, its treatment method is easy to discern. Therefore, removing Guizhi and adding Bawei and Fuzhu can indeed be seen as a treatment for the yang deficiency in the middle and lower jiao to prevent collapse. This is indeed refined!</p>
<p>It should be noted that with deficiency and labor, to the point of losing blood and essence, consuming essence and fluids, leading to extreme emaciation and exhaustion, it is difficult to find strength.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it is stated that when there is no remedy for acupuncture and medicine, one should adjust with sweet herbs. The &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; follows this principle and uses Xiao Jianzhong Decoction and Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction to urgently bolster the vital energy of Jianzhong, allowing for an increase in food intake and vitality of bodily fluids, ultimately replenishing blood and essence to restore insufficient true yin. One should focus on the sweet essence derived from grain and avoid sour, pungent, salty, and bitter tastes, as there are no other effective methods. Moreover, when applying this method, it is crucial to avoid excess; it is better to induce some bitterness than to use the sweet in Jianzhong. If sweet herbs are consumed and there is a slight sensation of obstruction or stagnation, it is necessary to consider whether the sweetness has been overused, as it can cause fullness. Early use of tangerine peel or cardamom can help to move things along.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>Otherwise, one cannot rely on sweet medicines; what else can one rely on? Later generations often use the prescriptions of &quot;Lejing&quot; Jianzhong Decoction and Shisiwei Jianzhong Decoction. Although they do not have the drawbacks of excessive sweetness, in the Lejing formula, Shenghu and Xixin are the chief ingredients, intended to dispel heat; however, the heat from yin deficiency cannot be dispelled. In the Shisiwei formula, using Fuzi, Guizhi, and Congrong aims to restore yang, yet the yang of yin deficiency may not necessarily be restored; it also depends on the skill of the practitioner in adjusting the formula.</p>
<p>The use of Bamei Shenqi Pill in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; has been mentioned repeatedly before. In cases of diabetes where the doors are wide open, and in water conditions where the doors are closed, using this formula stimulates kidney energy, thus the doors can open and close. Just like the morning doors, they open with yang and close with yin, relying on the surrounding areas for stability. For treating foot edema that ascends to the lower abdomen causing numbness, it is used to nourish the true yin and true yang at their root, allowing the turbid yin to gradually disperse without impacting the clear yang. </p>
<p>In current cases of deficiency labor, Guizhi and Fuzi are not utilized, but the symptoms of lower back pain, abdominal tightness, and difficulty in urination all stem from the subtle presence of true yang in the kidneys. These conditions are distinctly different from the symptoms of yin deficiency heat, and one cannot ignore these underlying factors while blaming the absence of treatment.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The disorder of deficiency and fatigue is most susceptible to the invasion of wind and qi. If the wind and qi are not eliminated, external symptoms will increase over time, while internal organs gradually suffer from depletion. This can lead to symptoms that are uncontrollable, with a risk of rapid demise. Therefore, we use the Dioscorea Pill to eliminate the wind and simultaneously nourish the deficiency.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; it states that the yang qi becomes agitated with fatigue. During summer, the essence can become depleted and lead to a state of distress. This has been extensively discussed in the introductory questions and answers. It is evident that deficiency and fatigue stem from the lack of interaction between the heart and kidneys—where kidney water fails to ascend and interact with heart fire, leading to unease and insomnia, not solely in summer.</p>
<p>The prescription of Sour Jujube Seed Decoction is recommended, with the jujube seed as the chief ingredient, complemented by the Restorative Root to nourish the kidneys. Poria and licorice are used to harmonize, while Chuanxiong enters the blood to alleviate the restlessness caused by heart fire.</p>
<p>Regarding the seven injuries, the &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; clearly states these are related to food, worry, diet, sexual relations, starvation, overexertion, and damage to the meridians and defensive qi from sexual overindulgence. However, there are claims suggesting that the seven injuries refer to issues like coldness, impotence, abdominal urgency, reduced essence, dampness below, and difficulty with urination—notions implying kidney injuries.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable that the Five Labors pertain to the five viscera, while the Seven Injuries pertain solely to one organ? Even though individuals may indulge, injuries to the kidneys are persistently common, thus they cannot be ascribed a fixed categorization.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>Therefore, for those suffering from deficiency syndrome due to internal injuries, there are these seven distinctions. Hence, deficiency fever has never been without stasis of blood. If there is no internal injury, the nourishing and guarding energies flow without obstruction, so where does the stasis originate? It must be due to irregularities in diet and daily activities; when the nourishing and guarding energies stagnate and accumulate, internal injuries occur. Then, the blood gets blocked in the areas of obstruction and becomes stagnant. If this stasis persists for long, it becomes deeply entrenched, and newly produced blood cannot circulate freely, accumulating with each passing day. Can such a person still maintain their life force? Zhang Zhongjing applied a remedy known as &quot;Reviving Human Hand and Eye,&quot; using da huang (rhubarb), insect pills, and lubricants to moisten the dry blood, promoting movement to dispel the stagnant blood. This treatment was named &quot;Soothing the Center and Nourishing Deficiency.&quot; Is it not aimed at moving the blood to remove stasis, thereby calming the interior and replenishing deficiency? Indeed, this is regarded in our society as an excellent treatment for dry blood deficiency.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>When blood coagulates internally and the pulse in the hands and feet is lost, this is the appropriate treatment. Additionally, using a medicinal ointment like Qiong Yu Gao for nourishment and replenishment is particularly effective. Examining the symptoms closely, one may find the skin and flesh disordered, the complexion darkening, accompanied by emaciation that leads to inability to eat or drink. This condition arises from the accumulation of stagnant blood in the stomach, manifesting on the skin and face, indicating a severe deficiency of the Earth&#39;s nourishment in the Five Organs. This differs from the fundamental illnesses of the Five Yin Organs, hence the prescribed method can be applied, guiding the removal of blood from the stomach to promote the flow of nourishment (Rong) and defense (Wei). Dr. Chen from Xuzhou transmitted the formula of Bai Lao Pill from Zhongjing, stating it treats all forms of consumption and stagnation due to overexertion, appropriate for those whose symptoms do not improve with medicinal intervention. Is it not akin to what is commonly referred to as Dry Blood Consumption? The doctor is perhaps adept at state affairs? The prescription includes: Dang Gui, frankincense, and myrrh, each one qian; ginseng two qian; rhubarb four qian; and fourteen pieces each of silkworms, leeches, and peach kernels, soaked and stripped of their peel.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>The above is a fine powder, refined into pills the size of sweet gum seeds. This makes up one dose of a hundred pills. In the early morning, take a hundred labor water to eliminate bad substances. Consume white porridge for ten days. The hundred labor water is, in fact, the sweet water of Zhongjing&#39;s Ganlan, stirred a hundred times with a scoop.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Fu Mai Tang,&quot; Zhongjing treats the pulse disturbance from exogenous cold leading to heart palpitations, a formula of great sanctity. It is not recorded in the &quot;Jin Gui,&quot; yet often used in &quot;Qian Jin Yi&quot; to treat deficiencies due to labor. This explains why it is named the formula of a thousand pieces of gold.</p>
<p>In cases of deficiency due to illness, there is frequently an external heat combined with internal yin deficiency, resulting in symptoms of sweating and oppression. If one merely treats the exterior without addressing the yin deficiency, true healing cannot be achieved. Only by using this formula can one induce sweating while releasing heat from the pulse, bringing comfort to the patient, which is a true method of sanctity.</p>
<p>However, those with deficiency often have depleted gastric fluids, unlike the violent heat of a severe cold. The use of cinnamon and ginger in significant amounts can lead to excessive heat, causing the fluids to dissipate externally. Once the fluids are lost, they are hard to regain, often leading to continued dripping and dampness for a full day and night.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>By passing this threshold, one should promptly remove the gui zhi (cinnamon twig) and sheng jiang (fresh ginger) from the original ingredients and triple the amount of ren shen (ginseng) instead. Follow this up, and it is hoped that bodily fluids will be restored, leading to a flourishing protective vitality and the exhaustion of any deficiencies—not a minor remedy! According to Xu Shuwei in &quot;Ben Shi Fang,&quot; Ge Zhi Chuan states that &quot;gui zhu&quot; refers to one of the five corpses. The harm caused by the evil spirits manifests in various ways; it generally leaves a person languid and silent, unaware of their suffering, with malevolence present everywhere. After accumulating for years, it can gradually lead to stagnation and ultimately death, often affecting those around them to the point of extinction of their family. If one realizes this is the case, they should urgently treat with a single otter liver, dry it in the shade to a powder, and take a small spoonful with water three times a day for effect, though how often it should be taken afterward is unclear. This remedy is indeed remarkable.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>According to the forbidden prescriptions taught by Master Chang Sang, when each disciple passes it on to one person, it eventually becomes lost upon reaching Hua Yuan, who died in prison, leading to its disappearance. Zhongjing, the saint among doctors, must have grasped the essence of all forbidden prescriptions. Yet, those who have the theory without the practical application are not worthy of respect. Likewise, those with practical results but lacking the underlying theory are also not worthy of respect. Even if there exists both theory and practice, if few wise men have taken heed of it, it is still not worthy of esteem. For instance, while the liver of the otter can eliminate parasites, it cannot promote blood flow to dispel stagnation. Hence, with the aim of nourishing the deficiency, the recipe for Dahuang (rhubarb) pills for reducing parasites was created, originally crafted and handed to Doctor Chen, while the Hundred Labors Pill, incorporating ginseng, is designed for immediate effect. This method, when well applied, could potentially yield substantial results. However, when one is at a loss and resorts to using otter liver to eliminate the parasites, can one really survive merely by removing the parasites? Yet, it is also true that the parasites must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Is there not intention behind the prescriptions found in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; along with those in the &quot;Zhouhou&quot;? According to Dongyuan&#39;s principle regarding diet and exhaustive labor, injury to vital energy causes the yang of the stomach to be unable to rise, leading to the heart and lungs’ energy to fall into the middle jiao. Therefore, it is treated by tonifying the middle and augmenting qi, supplemented with Chaihu (bupleurum) and Shengma (cimicifuga), which rotate in opposite directions around the stomach to elevate the falling energy of the upper jiao; this is not accomplished by merely raising it from the abdomen. If the clear energy sinks into the abdomen for a long time leading to diarrhea, using Sheng and Chai in abundance can effectively elevate from the abdomen.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>If the yang energy has not necessarily descended and instead ascends to elevate its yin energy, infringing upon the position of yang, how could such a transformation be trivial? Furthermore, if the yin energy is accustomed to obstructing the clear yang above, while the flesh in the chest swells and rises (like the moon), and the qi within the chest disperses causing bloating, applying this method mistakenly could lead to an upheaval, blocking the nine pathways, leaving one on the brink of death and in dire straits. Later generations have passed down that this method can elevate the clear and descend the turbid, and many knowledgeable individuals also believe this; can we still discuss medical matters? To nourish the qi within, allowing it to rise or fall on its own, one need not necessarily use methods to elevate it; using them is also acceptable. But if one demands the ability of elevating the clear from a method meant to descend the turbid, is that not foolish? </p>
<p>According to the evidence of deficiency due to overexertion, those with yin deficiency are often nine out of ten, while those with yang deficiency are only one or two at most. Danxi has commented on the excess of yang and insufficiency of yin, establishing the Great Yin Nourishing Pill, along with the Four Substances Decoction plus Huangbo and Zhimu, which parallels the method of Dongyuan in tonifying the middle and benefiting qi. If the qi sinks and cannot rise, then use Dongyuan&#39;s method; if the fire ascends and cannot descend, then utilize Danxi&#39;s method. Both of these elder physicians have profound insights and have reached their extremes; there is no room for debate.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>The introduction discusses the method of補中益氣 (Buzhong Yiqi), which can raise the clear Yang. However, if misapplied, it may instead elevate the turbid Yin, hence the caution that follows. As for Danxi&#39;s method, many who use it find it ineffective—shouldn&#39;t we ponder deeply the reasons for this? Chang asserts that those who establish the law are without fault, while those who apply it may fail to grasp its essence, leading to deviations in their practice.</p>
<p>In essence, there is often an excess of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, yet this point is rarely examined with care. If Yin has a true deficiency at three out of ten while Yang has a true excess at seven out of ten, this is what is meant by true excess and true deficiency. When Yang is truly in excess, any remedies that supplement Yin can be taken freely without fear, and even heavy usage is harmless, thus making the supplementation of Yin necessary.</p>
<p>However, if Yin is genuinely deficient (three out of ten), while Yang appears to be excess (remaining four or five out of ten), it is also referred to as excess, but in reality, it is not a true excess—it ultimately results in the same outcome of deficiency.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>Are we still daring to recklessly use medicines that supplement the yin and alleviate coldness? Not understanding this principle and using them indiscriminately will not only be ineffective, but will also lead to a condition of excessive yin and deficient yang, resulting in issues such as spontaneous sweating and weakness of the spleen. Ultimately, the foundation of the yin has already been compromised, and when trying to replenish qi, how can they carry it? Therefore, I reiterate the caution to follow the methods of ancient practitioners, like holding a scale in hand, to weigh and balance their use. Among those suffering from deficiency and excessive yang, is there surely not one or two cases? The formulas from the Yan family, such as Qi Fu Decoction and Ren Fu Decoction, seem indispensable. These formulas are derived from the &quot;Jin Kui&quot; Zhou Fu Decoction, and when used appropriately, they resonate with the spirit. For those with deficiency and loss of blood, the appropriate ones are particularly numerous as they effectively treat the yin fire of Dragon and Thunder. However, with ginseng and astragalus as the monarch and minister, although each dose may be a couple of taels, it is not considered excessive. In the formula, stop using equal parts of astragalus and fuzi; instead, use five qian of ginseng and one tael of fuzi, divided into three doses. Can this not work?<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br><strong>General Guidelines for Medicinal Usage in Chen Zangqi</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Door of Xu Lao (Emaciation)</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Total Compilation of Jingyue</strong> [Ming, Zhang Jiebin]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Origins of Xu Sun Disease</strong></p>
<p>In cases of labor-induced emaciation, each of the five organs has its responsibilities, yet the heart bears the heaviest burden. The heart is the sovereign organ, upon which the vitality of the entire body depends, making it most vulnerable to harm; yet many people overlook this, unaware of its significance. The spirits of the five organs all depend on the heart; thus, when worries arise in the heart, the lungs must respond. If worry persists, leading to deep, somber feelings, the yang energy gradually depletes, and the nutritive and defensive energies diminish day by day. When labor adversely affects the lungs, this situation does not continue indefinitely. As the classic text states: &quot;When one experiences elevated status after a period of devaluation, though not afflicted by an external pathogenic factor, illness arises from within, termed ‘loss of nutritive energy.’ When one experiences wealth after a period of poverty, it is termed ‘loss of essence,’ as the five energies become intertwined, resulting in various afflictions. Sudden joy or sudden sorrow, happiness followed by suffering—all exhaust the vital essence. When the vital essence is depleted, the body deteriorates, leading to significant losses in vitality.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>Though not influenced by external evils, if one&#39;s spirit suffers internally, their body will inevitably face defeat and demise. This is simply due to worries about the future and regret over the past, resulting in harm to both the Yang energies, which quietly diminish and flicker in the darkness, unnoticed by people, leading them to be unaware of the damage to the internal organs. The heart is fundamental; in such cases, one should promptly relieve their emotions and accept their fate, striving to restore their innate vitality.</p>
<p>One must understand that in life, happiness for a day equals gaining a day, while sorrow for a day means losing a day. As long as the spirit remains clear and awake, what dust and demons could dare approach? When illness occurs, using remedies like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and various invigorating soups is merely a remedy for the aftermath. The wise should recognize what must be prioritized.</p>
<p>Joy arises from fulfilling desires and seems harmless. Yet, the classics state: joy can damage the heart; it also says that excessive joy harms the Yang; it further states that those who experience joy too freely have scattered spirits that cannot collect; and it says that excessive joy in the lungs leads to harm to the Po spirit, causing madness, wherein one loses their sense of self, leading to a withered appearance, pale complexion, and death in summer. </p>
<p>The heart houses the spirit, and the lungs house the Qi; both are organs of the Yang. Therefore, excessive unrestrained joy harms the Yang, dissipating spirit and energy. If one indulges in joy without moderation, it leads to aimless dispersion, resulting in mental exhaustion that may become irreparable.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>Sometimes, when one occasionally achieves success, their heart fills with pride, leading to arrogance and self-destruction, often without realizing it. Thus, what should not be overlooked can still be ignored. </p>
<p>The source of thought lies in the heart. The classic text states: when the heart is anxious and troubled, it harms the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear and loss of self follow, leading to physical decline and premature aging, resulting in death in winter. This is how heart injury occurs. Thought arises from the heart, and the spleen must respond; therefore, persistent thinking can injure the spleen. The classic text says: thinking injures the spleen; it also states: when the heart holds onto thoughts, the spirit has a place to return, and the righteous qi remains stagnant, causing obstruction. All of this is illness; when the spleen&#39;s energy is obstructed, it leads to choking, vomiting, and an inability to digest food. When food cannot be digested, blood and energy are depleted daily, muscles deteriorate, and mental vitality diminishes, causing limbs to swell and leading to diarrhea, among other symptoms. This is the injury to the yang of the heart and spleen. Who among people is without thoughts? Yet, when overthinking causes pain, it leads to such injuries—this is something those who practice health preservation should be aware of. Furthermore, while thought primarily injures the spleen, worry also harms the spleen.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>The classics say: If the spleen is troubled and cannot resolve its worries, it injures the mind; when the mind is injured, the thoughts become disordered, the limbs become weak, and the complexion pales, leading to death in spring. People’s worries and thoughts are generally numerous and mixed, and thus the heart, spleen, and lungs are all damaged, resulting in harm to the yang qi of the upper burner. The diseases of the two yang originate from the heart and spleen, progressively manifesting as symptoms of deficiency, presented here.</p>
<p>Lustful desires and evil thoughts differ from worries and thoughts, yet they harm only the kidneys. The heart, when tempted by desires, must respond with the kidneys. When the sovereign fire moves upward, the ministerial fire responds below. This ministerial fire is the fire within water; when still and guarded, it constitutes yang qi, but when fervent and uncontrolled, it becomes like dragon thunder, scorching all. Thus, when it is in the kidneys, it results in residual heat and turbidity; as the water and liquids gradually dry up and the fire rises into the liver, it forces the blood into chaotic movement, causing vomiting or nosebleeds, or leading to deficiencies that result in pain in the sinews and bones. If it further ascends to the spleen, it injures the spleen&#39;s yin, resulting in fevers and the total transformation of food into phlegm. If it ascends to the lungs, the skin and hair lose their ability to be firm, leading to a loss of yang, causing wheezing and cough, and even leading to mute and hoarse voices.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>These are all rootless, empty fires; the yang does not guard the home, and its flames reach to the heavens, rising from below, from the kidneys to the lungs. The source gradually withers, with the upper part solid and the lower part empty, truly a manifestation of extreme depletion. Among those who are unaccompanied, such as monks and female practitioners, even though they are not entangled in marital duties, their private feelings are bound in love, and their thoughts are endless. When separated by thousands of miles and their wishes unfulfilled, the fiery desire shakes their hearts, the true yin decreases daily, leading to irreparable emptiness and loss. Among the five labors, none is worse than this. If one knows to value life, they must carefully avoid it!</p>
<p>The seven feelings harm the kidneys, and fear is likely among them. Fear and dread reside in the heart, hence the kidneys are affected. Therefore, the scriptures say: fear harms the kidneys; it also says: fear causes the essence to retreat; and again it mentions: fear and anxiety without resolution harm the essence. When the essence is harmed, the bones ache, and there is weakness and numbness in the limbs. I once diagnosed a young official whose illness stemmed from fear; although his condition slightly improved, he became impotent, and when his illness recurred, it was ultimately incurable. I have also witnessed those who experience sudden fear; they invariably suffer from retraction of the yin or involuntary urination, all indications of kidney injury.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>However, excessive anger indeed harms the kidneys, and anger itself also damages the kidneys. The classic text states: &quot;When the kidneys are overwhelmed by anger and do not cease, it injures the will. When the will is injured, joy forgets its previous words, the lower back cannot bend or extend, hair withers, complexion fades, and death occurs in late summer.&quot; Thus, it is understood that severe anger not only harms the liver, but also the kidneys suffer damage.</p>
<p>Anger arises from the heart, and the liver must respond. If anger is unrestrained, it causes labor and harm to the liver. The classic text states: &quot;Anger injures the liver&quot;; it also states: &quot;Anger causes the qi to rebel, and in severe cases, leads to vomiting blood and diarrhea, which causes the qi to rise.&quot; This is because the liver is a yang organ within the yin, so liver diseases can manifest in both yin and yang aspects. For instance, if anger causes fire to surge, it forces the blood to move erratically, resulting in qi rebellion, leading to distention, pain, and shortness of breath; this injures its yin. Alternatively, if anger injures the qi, the wood element becomes stagnant and cannot extend, which adversely affects the spleen&#39;s qi, resulting in bloating, pain, and food and drink not moving well; this injures its yang. However, the occasional expression of anger does not necessarily lead to illness, and firm internal organs do not always result in disease.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>Only those who are weak in their innate constitution and easily harmed by the three yin should avoid excess without knowledge of moderation; otherwise, the abundance from the East will often lead to ruin in the West. Anger primarily injures the liver, while grief also most severely hurts the liver. The classics say: when grief moves the liver, it damages the soul; when the soul is harmed, one becomes manic and unfocused; when unfocused, one becomes imprecise. This leads to a retraction of the yin and rigidity of the tendons, the sides of the body are unsupported, the hair wanes, the complexion fades, leading to death in autumn. Indeed, excessive anger injures the liver, indicating abundant liver qi; grief injures the liver, indicating deficient liver qi. However, abundance does not last forever, whereas deficiency can lead to lasting emptiness. If deficiency is neglected, it will inevitably cause exhaustion, and treatment must focus on discerning the right from the wrong.</p>
<p>The shock energy originally enters the heart but indeed connects with the liver and gallbladder. The classics say: when startled, the heart has nothing to rely on, the spirit has nowhere to return, and thoughts are not settled, thus the qi becomes chaotic. Furthermore, it is said: the color associated with the East is green, which connects with the liver, and ailments arise from shock. This is why shock can disturb the heart, but especially injure the liver and gallbladder.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>The heart, as the ruler, must not be harmed; however, the gallbladder, serving as the official of middle righteousness, truly houses the vital energy of Shaoyang. Therefore, the yang essence of the eleven organs depends on the gallbladder. If it is harmed, the vital energies of the organs will dwindle, leading to inevitable defeat and danger. I have observed those who fall ill from slight fright; by nurturing the heart and calming the spirit, when the spirit is restored, the illness will dissipate. If fear accumulates over time or if a sudden fright harms the gallbladder, it can cause bile to seep, resulting in a yellowing of the entire body, leaving one silently suffering—such cases are beyond remedy, as elaborated in the discourse on jaundice.</p>
<p>Excessive desire for color and form often leads to depletion. Since from birth, one relies solely on the postnatal essence and energy as the foundation of life. Thus, strong essence leads to a strong spirit; a strong spirit must have longevity. Conversely, weak essence and energy result in weakness, often leading to premature death. Those who are naturally endowed but have a thin base must recognize and cultivate their postnatal essence; in doing so, longevity can be achieved. However, if one’s endowment is already weak, and yet one indulges in desires and exhausts postnatal energy, it will surely lead to depletion. In such cases, who shall be blamed for the loss of life? </p>
<p>Moreover, there are young ones who have not yet matured; at the time when Ren water is just beginning, nurturing their budding vitality is crucial. If ignorant youths quickly indulge in sexual desires, I have witnessed many like unfurling buds, like mayflies flickering from dawn to dusk—this is truly lamentable. The blame does not fall upon the youth but on their parents and teachers.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>If one does not first provide clear teachings to guide them on the way to preserve life, how could a childlike heart discern between profit and loss? They would merely approach with desperate prayers and cries of sorrow; how would this be of any help? Those who neglect the strain of labor often suffer from exhaustion. Who can escape labor in this world? Like those who toil daily for their livelihood, tirelessly pursuing their work yet unaware of their ailments—how is this so? The labor of poverty and hardship, if done with moderation and detached from fame and disgrace, becomes a habit that poses no illness. It is only the idle and delicate who, in overexerting themselves, suffer harm. Thus, some labor for fame and wealth, unaware of the toll of seasons on their health; some labor for lust, oblivious to the fatigue of day and night; some labor in idleness, enduring hunger and exhaustively rushing to and fro; some labor under illness, suffering further harm at the hands of incompetent and fraudulent doctors; some are ensnared by poetry and learning, each misfortune growing from their obsession; and some, driven by a reckless bravado, ultimately become exhausted and drained of strength.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>In summary, those who do not know their own limits and strive to push themselves can easily lead to misfortune with reckless actions. The harms from labor and fatigue, although said to originate in the spleen, vary greatly. Injuries to tendons, bones, energy, blood, essence, spirit, skin, and muscles all truly involve the internal organs. Alas! Indulgence in desires can be so harmful. The reason lies in forgetting the self while being aware of the external. Guang Chengzi said: Do not labor the form, do not shake the essence; only then can one achieve longevity. These two sayings are succinct and thus often simplified by people, who do not recognize the principles of health preservation, all contained within these eight characters. Can they be overlooked? </p>
<p>A young person who frequently drinks wine tends to suffer from labor and damage. Wine is fundamentally an intoxicating substance that greatly harms the true essence. Drinking a little may not necessarily be harmful, but excessive drinking inevitably leads to injury, and those who indulge excessively suffer the consequences in almost all cases. Furthermore, every person&#39;s constitution has yin and yang, and the nature of wine also possesses yin and yang. Wine is made through fermentation, which gives it a hot nature; when it is diluted with water, it has a cold quality.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>If those with Yin deficiency indulge excessively in drinking, their constitution is insufficient to nourish Yin, leading to a tendency to generate heat. Thus, the heat intensifies, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting blood, bloody nosebleeds, blood in stools, blood in urine, wheezing, irritability, mania, and agitation. This is because alcohol harms Yin. Conversely, if those with Yang deficiency indulge, their constitution is unable to support Yang, causing fluids to accumulate as dampness. Therefore, the cold increases, leading to symptoms such as swelling, diarrhea, abdominal pain, acid reflux, poor appetite, loss of Yang, and sudden collapse. This occurs because alcohol injures Yang. Thus, excessive drinking can harm both Yin and Yang, with such dangers present—are people aware of this? Moreover, alcohol can disrupt one&#39;s nature; it often leads to reckless behavior, resulting in damage to essence and depletion of energy, causing distress and loss of balance—encountering illness can be overwhelming. The damage to Yin goes often unnoticed. During times of excessive drinking, one does not consider the harm that can arise. When illness strikes severely, one may still be unaware that it is due to the effects of alcohol. Therefore, I have detailed these points, hoping that those who drink excessively may become more aware. A single disease mismanaged or failure in regulation often leads to chronic harm post-illness.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>Diseases can be classified as deficiency or excess, and treatments should either tonify or drain. Only when supplementation and draining are properly administered can one be considered a master in the field. I have observed that many practitioners do not understand the principles of healing, and they are neither aware of what is right or wrong nor understand the urgency of conditions. As a result, they often harm the vital energy of patients and disrupt their life force; those who suffer and die from the treatment have no recourse. Those who are fortunate enough to escape still suffer from the detrimental effects, leading to many cases of deficiency that cannot recover. Why is this the case? Thus, it is crucial that medical professionals approach their craft with care and avoid rashness, as this is genuinely a part of accumulating virtue for compassionate individuals. </p>
<p>Moreover, if there are failures in regulation and treatment leading to inability to recover, the saying goes: &quot;If the small hole is not patched, the large hole will lament suffering.&quot; This results from one&#39;s own actions, so what more is there to criticize? </p>
<p>The causes of deficiency are as previously discussed and stem solely from indulgence in alcohol, pleasures, labor, emotional strains, and dietary excesses. Thus, one might first injure the vital energy, which will subsequently affect the essence; or one might first injure the essence, which will then affect the vital energy. Both vital energy and essence within a person are referred to as the yin aspect. Yin is the root of all that is heavenly, the progenitor of form and substance. Therefore, any loss related to form and substance is collectively termed as yin deficiency—this is a fundamental observation.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>If we speak of divisions, there are those with yin within yin deficiency, whose ailments include fever and irritability, a red head and face, dry lips and parched tongue, throat pain and mouth ulcers, vomiting, nosebleeds, blood in urine, hard and dry bowels, and painful and difficult urination. </p>
<p>There are also those with yin within yang deficiency, whose ailments include sensitivity to cold, emaciation, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, poor appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and incontinence. This can extend to coughing with phlegm, nocturnal emissions, night sweats, wheezing with a hushed voice, muscle and joint pain, confusion of the mind, extreme muscle wasting, dreams of encounters with ghosts, and women experiencing missed menstrual periods. </p>
<p>Thus, regardless of yin or yang, in severe illness, all symptoms are inevitably present, stemming from the failure of true yin. True yin resides in the kidneys, which are regarded as the sea of essence and blood, and the vital energy of a person corresponds to the yang energy of heaven and earth, flowing upward, making the kidneys the foundation of the five organs.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>When the kidney&#39;s water is deficient, the liver lacks nourishment, leading to dryness in the blood; when the kidney&#39;s water is deficient, water does not return to its source, causing phlegm in the spleen; when the kidney&#39;s water is deficient, the heart and kidney do not interact, resulting in a decline in spirit and complexion; when the kidney&#39;s water is deficient, it harms the lung&#39;s qi, leading to frequent coughing and wheezing; when the kidney&#39;s water is deficient, solitary yang lacks a master, causing an excessive fire. In all cases of exhaustion and related symptoms, if the root is not damaged, how could there be such severe consequences? Therefore, in all illnesses more pronounced at the upper part, the depletion must be more severe at the lower part. Hence, I say: when the emptiness of malicious influences arrives, the harm must return to yin; the injuries of the five organs ultimately affect the kidney. When it reaches this point, what more can I do? What is valued is that the noble man recognizes the subtle signs. </p>
<p>All damages to the original qi are fundamentally empty conditions. Ancient methods distinguished these empty damages—whether from exhaustion or consumption—into various categories; even if the diseases seem different, they should still be discerned. The term &quot;empty damage&quot; implies that it may manifest as one symptom or may result in fatigue for a time; as long as it pertains to the meridians or organs and harms the original qi, it is fundamentally an empty damage condition. As for the differing symptoms of exhaustion and disease, some may present with bone steaming, some with dry coughing, and even with coughing up blood or phlegm, leading to failure in both nutritive and protective qi, resulting in continual decline. This accumulation occurs gradually; when both the root and the branches are exhausted, it is a consequence. However, the emptiness of damage can be found either in the yin aspect or in the yang aspect.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>When the illness is not deep yet, it is advisable to use warming tonics. However, in cases of exhaustion and consumptive disorders, where the deficiency is deep in the yin region, there are many conditions where warming tonics should be avoided. In general, for treating deficiency syndromes, conditions that are appropriate for warming tonics tend to be easier to treat; those that are not suitable for warming tonics are often harder to treat. This deficiency and exhaustion may seem different, but it is important to recognize that the damage from consumptive illnesses is deeply rooted and leads to considerable deficiency.</p>
<p>If the signs of deficiency remain, they will gradually worsen into exhaustion, and one must be cautious about this. If there are two prominent red cheeks or red lips, it indicates a deficiency in the lower part, forcing the yang upward. As Zhang Zhongjing stated, the face displaying yang is due to deficiency below. If there is much thirst, it signifies insufficient kidney water, as the body seeks to replenish itself. Hoarseness or the inability to speak arises from depleted kidney energy, since sound emerges from the throat but is fundamentally rooted in the kidneys. The classics say: when one loses internal vitality, they become mute. This indicates kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>If there is deficiency accompanied by urgent breathing, it is due to yin-deficient lungs, where the qi has nowhere to settle. Dry throat and sore throat indicate a deficiency in true water below and an excess of floating fire above. If one cannot sleep and feels disoriented, it shows that blood does not nurture the heart, causing the spirit to be uncontained. Frequent irritability indicates that there is no yin amidst the yang, and softness cannot assist the hardness.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>Excessive anger arises from a deficiency in water and a dryness in wood, leading the liver to lose its nourishment. A lack of appetite and gradual muscle wasting indicate that the spleen&#39;s essence is lost and the transformative mechanism is failing. A racing heart and restlessness signify that the qi is not returning to its essence. It is said: the great network of the stomach is called the &quot;virtual interior,&quot; originating below the left breast, responding to clothing and indicating a leakage of vital qi. Continuous night sweats occur when there is fire, preventing the yin from holding, and without fire, the yang cannot be stabilized. When there is a deficiency accompanied by phlegm, whether it resembles clear water or has much white foam, it is due to water overflowing as phlegm, and the spleen is too weak to control water. Bone pain that feels like fractures indicates the kidney governs bones, and true yin is depleting. Pain in the waist and flanks suggests deficiency in both the liver and kidney. Coldness below the knees signifies the gate of life is failing, causing fire not to return to its source. Yellow, cloudy urination indicates true yin depletion and the qi is unable to transform water. A burning sensation in the soles of the feet shows that empty fire is consuming yin, leading to depletion of the bubbling spring. </p>
<p>In general, a person with yang deficiency suffers from qi deficiency. If yang is deficient, one cannot sneeze. Zhongjing said: &quot;If one wishes to sneeze but cannot, this indicates cold in the abdomen.&quot; Therefore, whenever symptoms of yang deficiency are present and a sneeze occurs, it signifies a chance of revival.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Pulse</h3>
<p>The pulse that is weak and deficient, whether it is extremely rapid and numerous, excessively thin and weak, excessively slippery and smooth, too short or too long, overly floating or sinking, very taut or tight, excessively flowing or solid, all indicate a pulse of labor injury. Regardless of whether it is floating or sinking, large or small, as long as it becomes gradually slower, there will be some vitality. If the pulse is overly taut, the illness will be severe; if it is too rapid, the illness will be perilous. If it is both taut and thin, with added tightness and rapidity, the chances of survival are virtually none. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials&quot; states: A pulse that is lacking (or hollow) indicates blood deficiency; one that is sinking, slow, and small indicates loss of qi; a large and weak pulse indicates yang deficiency; a rapid and weak pulse indicates yin deficiency; a large and hollow pulse indicates blood loss; a normal large pulse indicates labor; an extremely weak pulse also indicates labor; a very thin and weak pulse signals night sweats; a weak and soft pulse at the cun (distal) position indicates upper deficiency; a weak and soft pulse at the chi (proximal) position indicates lower deficiency; a soft and slippery pulse at the chi indicates blood deficiency; and with both guan positions sinking and thin, it indicates stomach deficiency. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: A soft pulse indicates deficiency, a slow pulse indicates deficiency, a weak pulse indicates deficiency, a taut pulse indicates moderate deficiency, and a pulse that is both thin and weak indicates deficiency in both qi and blood.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Nails</strong></p>
<p>All Diseases of Strain and Injury Originally Belong to Yin Deficiency. Yin Deficiency Must Invariably Lead to Blood Deficiency, and Fingernails Are the Residue of Essence and Blood. Thus, when diagnosing, if one observes the nails to be dry and yellow, feeling a withered appearance, then the vital essence and nourishment of hair and skin are visibly apparent. This indicates the presence of deficiency symptoms beyond just pulse and color, and the severity of the deficiency can also be discerned from it.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The deficiency and damage of diseases exhibit different transformations, with variations occurring from the Five Strains and Seven Injuries, manifesting in the functions of the nutritive and defensive qi as well as the organs. In summary, what sustains life is solely this essence and qi; and in diseases characterized as deficient and damaged, it is also solely this essence and qi. Deficiency of qi reflects Yang Deficiency; deficiency of essence reflects Yin Deficiency. In cases where there is excessive fire and insufficient water, and one observes the nutritive and defensive qi to be dry, with body fluids depleted, this denotes symptoms of Yin Deficiency. Conversely, in cases of excessive water and insufficient fire, with the organs being cold and the spleen and kidneys failing, this indicates symptoms of Yang Deficiency. This is merely due to the imbalance of Yin and Yang. </p>
<p>When treating these conditions, one should only nourish the deficient aspect and not deplete the excess. If one were to further deplete what is in excess due to existing deficiency, it would result in mutual harm. Would this not be perilous? The differentiation of Yin and Yang is not readily clear. Within Yin and Yang, there exist further distinctions; some may seem Yang but are not, some may appear Yin but are not. Without true discernment, it is easy to fall into confusion, thus this should be carefully examined. Furthermore, there are instances of both Yin and Yang being deficient; in such cases, Yang is the foundation of life, and what is emphasized should primarily be the Yang qi.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>In this context, the treatment of deficiency is like pointing out with fingers. Those with yang deficiency often feel cold, not due to external cold but because the yang energy is insufficient, leading to internal coldness. If one waits until it is already cold, then the yang has already weakened. If one perceives a weakness in the illness without any signs of heat, it is indeed a sign of yang deficiency. One should then warm and tonify the original energy, allowing the yang energy to gradually return, thus restoring the true essence. </p>
<p>The condition of yang deficiency is often caused by worries, excessive thinking that harms the spirit, or irregular labor that exhausts strength, or excessive desire that depletes the essence, or a natural lack of original yang leading to cold-related ailments—these are all reasons for the damage to yang energy. To replenish yang energy, only warm, sweet, and dry herbs are suitable; never combine them with cool, cold, or slippery substances, as those would deplete the emerging energy. Herbs like rehmannia, peony, ophiopogon, and sand ginseng are to be avoided, while those such as dendrobium, scrophularia, and others like phellodendron, coptis, and turtle gelatin must also be strictly omitted. If both qi and blood are deficient, a strong formula like the Great Replenishing Decoction, Eight Treasures Decoction, or Ten Complete Replenishing Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>When there is deficiency in all five organs, it is advisable to use the Wufu Decoction for nourishing. If there is insufficient yin in the Kidney Gate, use the Zuogui Decoction or Zuogui Pill. If there is insufficient yang in the Kidney Gate, use the Yougui Decoction or Yougui Pill. If there is deficiency of qi with chill, use the Liuqi Decoction. For deficiency of yin in the spleen and kidney with various symptoms of cold, use the Liyin Decoction. If there is great deficiency of yang qi in the Sanjiao, use the Liuwei Huayang Decoction. If there is qi deficiency with spleen cold, use the Yiqi Dan. For deficiency of stomach qi with chill, use the Wengwei Decoction or the Lizhong Decoction. For blood deficiency with cold stagnation, use the Wuwu Decoction.</p>
<p>When yin is deficient, there is often much heat, as water does not help fire, and yin deficiency generates heat. This condition is often caused by indulgences in wine and desires, or by anger and evil thoughts, which disturb the fire of the five organs. Those who have a congenital deficiency of primordial yin are particularly prone to this condition. In cases of deficiency leading to excess heat and dryness, hot foods are not advisable, indicating a state of yin deficiency. To nourish the yin, one should only consume sweet, cool, and serene substances. Anything that has fire within the yin is strongly contraindicated, such as ginger, cinnamon, aconite, dried paper mulberry, white and cold atractylodes, and pinellia; these should not be used lightly.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>For example, ginseng, astragalus, wolfberry, angelica, and eucommia are all substances that contain both yin and yang, and they should be used appropriately. This is because an excess of yang may further deplete yin, and an increase in heat can dry up water. Those with yin deficiency suffer from a lack of water, and those who are low in water should avoid cold and cool substances, as these are harmful and not nourishing. If there is excessive fire and one must resort to cooling agents, it is also necessary to combine them with tonics for the water element, using them in conjunction as needed, and stopping when appropriate to prevent deterioration. This is the great principle of nourishment.</p>
<p>For conditions of deficiency and night heat, or heat occurring in the afternoon, or when one prefers cold yet feels solid, these all indicate heat arising from yin deficiency, where water fails to control fire, and it is advisable to adjust the formula with a yin tonic. If the fire affects the heart and kidney, leading to palpitations and lack of focus, a stronger yin tonic is recommended. If there is persistent external heat with mild internal heat, one should merely tonify yin and not clear the fire, opting for a basic yin decoction, or Six-ingredient Rehmannia Decoction. If there is insufficient vital energy accompanied by persistent heat, a major decoction to restore the original qi must be used to promote self-healing over time.</p>
<p>For a deficiency-related cough, although all five organs may be affected, the focus is primarily on the lungs and kidneys.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>The lungs are considered the organ of metal, and what metal fears is fire, while its destructive influence comes from dryness. When dryness occurs, itching inevitably follows, and with itching comes coughing. This is exactly because the water from the kidneys cannot control the fire, thus affecting the metal; the yin essence cannot transform into qi, leading to dryness and causing symptoms like cough, wheezing, sore throat, voice hoarseness, and other related conditions. </p>
<p>When treating these symptoms, one should use only soothing, cool, and tranquilizing remedies to nourish the metal and water, ensuring that the lungs and kidneys support each other, without being overpowered by fire, which allows the true yin to gradually recover and the cough to improve. If fire is vigorous, one should use a modified Four Yin Decoction. If fire is mild, then a One Yin Decoction or the Liu Wei Di Huang Decoction, or the Left Returning Decoction may be appropriate. For those who have contracted wind and cold along with cough, the Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction is recommended. The Bei Mu Pill is the best for treating cough. </p>
<p>For those with deficiency leading to hemoptysis, this injures their yin, which can cause either vomiting or nasal bleeding. However, one must assess whether there is fire present and the degree of its severity to treat accordingly. When fire is intense, it carries the blood upward, and there will be distinguishable heat signs between the pulse and symptoms.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>In urgent situations, one must address the symptoms rather than the root cause, and thus, it is necessary to temporarily use herbs like Qín, Lián, Zhī, Yè, bamboo leaves, and童便 (child&#39;s urine). Alternatively, one may use formulas such as Chōuxīn drink or Xǐnxīn drink. If there is a deficiency of Yin accompanied by slight Fire, the appropriate remedy is to prepare Bǎo Yīn decoction, or Qīng Huà drink, or modify Yīnyīn decoction to treat the condition. Once the bleeding has stopped, it is essential to nourish the blood without excessively using cold or cool substances. If there is no excess Fire but the Yin is completely damaged, leading to a deficiency of Yin and a loss of water, causing vomiting or nosebleeds, one should use sweet and pure nourishing Yin products to quiet the movement and harmonize the damage. This allows the Yin energy to rest and be nourished, which will help the blood return to normal channels. Formulas such as Yīnyīn decoction, Liù Wèi Dì Huáng Tang, or Xiǎo Yíng decoction would be appropriate. If there is a Yin deficiency affecting the lungs, accompanied by coughing and bleeding, one should use Sì Yīnyīn decoction with adjustments. If bleeding occurs due to overexertion without any Fire symptoms, and all three Yin -- heart, spleen, and kidney -- are harmed and causing bleeding, one should use Wǔ Yīnyīn decoction, Wǔ Fú drink, or Liù Wèi Dì Huáng pill. If there is a Yin deficiency below and the Yang is constrained above, with all six pulse positions weak and leading to severe vomiting and nosebleeds, this indicates that Fire is not returning to its source, and True Yang has lost control. One should use Yòu Guī drink with modifications or Bā Wèi Dì Huáng Tang as suitable alternatives. This condition is commonly seen in those who have been overly burdened by worry and exhaustion.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>If vomiting and diarrhea easily occur due to fatigue, it is often because the spleen fails to manage blood, resulting in vomiting or bleeding. One should use the Six-Flavor Reverting Yang Decoction with an increased amount of white atractylodes as the main remedy, and it is crucial to avoid cool medicines. </p>
<p>If there is significant vomiting and bleeding, with weak and thin pulse, cold hands and feet, and a critical state imminent, while the bleeding still does not stop, it is essential to quickly use the Zhen Yin Decoction, which will stop the bleeding on its own. If the bleeding is severe and the qi also follows suit, resulting in coldness and fainting, one must promptly replenish qi to stabilize life force. The Six-Flavor Reverting Yang Decoction or the Four-Flavor Reverting Yang Decoction should be used. If cold or cool substances are used again, it would be fatal.</p>
<p>In summary, bleeding and vomiting manifest from significant damage to the yin aspect, which demands careful attention to nourishing the original qi and cultivating true yin. Otherwise, the use of cold and cool substances will further deplete the yin qi, and although the bleeding may stop, the condition will inevitably worsen day by day.</p>
<p>Yin deficiency and damage arise from the five organs. Although each organ has its own dominion, there are aspects of diagnosis and treatment in the five organs that can be distinguished, as well as those that cannot.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>In cases of qi deficiency, the treatment lies in the lungs; for spirit deficiency, it is in the heart; for deficiency in food and muscle, it is in the spleen; for blood and membrane deficiency, it is in the liver; and for essence and marrow deficiency, it is in the kidneys. These are the distinctions that can be made. However, qi governs the lungs and transforms through essence, the spirit governs the heart and transforms through qi, muscle comes under the spleen and the earth is born from fire, all blood is stored in the liver and blood transforms in the spleen and stomach, essence and marrow govern the kidneys and receive from the five organs, which are inseparable. When the state becomes severe, the root and branch are transmitted and affect the organs and viscera, thus this aspect cannot be strictly defined. Therefore, in all methods of replenishing deficiency, one must clarify the principles of yin and yang, their ascents and descents, and the nature of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness; with essence being within qi and qi being within essence. Furthermore, in cases of insufficient yang qi in the upper jiao, it must descend into the kidneys; thus, it ought to be sought below the most yin; and when there is insufficient true yin in the lower jiao, it often rises above—should we not guide it back to its source? Therefore, the treatment must seek the root to achieve the utmost goodness. However, my other methods of supplementation are all found within the new formulas of the eight guidelines and eight arrays; with careful observation, one can grasp their essence. For symptoms not fully manifest, such as nocturnal emission, dream leakage, hoarse voice, night sweats, and women&#39;s blood depletion or menstrual cessation, one should just inquire in each relevant domain, and there will be corresponding guidance available.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Between Apparent Damage and Non-Damage</strong></p>
<p>In cases where there appear to be damages but are not, this phenomenon is only present when the body has been subjected to external cold pathogens. Initially, when these external pathogens invade, they do not disperse and are mistakenly treated as internal injuries; treatments may involve cooling or drainage methods, which can lead to the cold pathogens becoming trapped and lingering, resulting in alternating chills and fever or phlegmy cough. The symptoms may seem identical to those of exhaustion. If one treats this condition with methods aimed at injuries, such as nourishing yin, this can actually exacerbate the retention of the pathogens, leading to prolonged heat effects, ultimately transforming what is not an injury into an actual injury. I have treated several patients with this condition. To distinguish such cases, one must carefully analyze both the exterior and the interior and investigate the causes of the illness. Symptoms indicative of exhaustion always stem from some cause, whereas external pathogen invasion occurs suddenly. If there is bodily pain accompanied by slight sweating, resulting in diminished fever, yet fever returns without sweating, or if there is a loud cough with a pulse that feels taut but not overly rapid, or a mix of harmonious and relaxed symptoms, then even if the illness lasts for a month or two without resolution of the pathogens, this is not a case of labor injury—do not misdiagnose. For those with persistent alternating fever and chills, it is advisable to use the Chai Hu Decoction (or variants thereof). If cough accompanies it, then add Chai Chen Decoction. For those with spleen and kidney qi deficiency accompanied by cough, use Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction. If the pathogens are still unresolved and accompanied by chills and fevers, continue adding Chai Hu.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br><strong>Deficiency and Its Dire Consequences</strong></p>
<p>When deficiency has already taken hold, how can one remedy it? If one cannot tolerate ginseng, cooked rhizoma rehmanniae, and various tonifying medicines, this indicates an inability to receive nourishment due to deficiency—how can one hope for recovery? If, after exhausting labor, one experiences vomiting of blood or significant blood loss, and suffers from coughing that cannot be stopped along with excessive phlegm, this is due to extreme deficiency of the spleen and lungs, rendering food unable to transform into blood, thus phlegm is formed from food consumed. Although this is not blood, it is similar in nature. The classics say: &quot;If white blood emerges, death follows.&quot; Hence, the phlegm that is the most abundant and turbid cannot be treated. </p>
<p>On either side of the body is the pathway of yin and yang. For those who cannot turn or change their position easily during sleep, it indicates an imbalance in yin and yang energies, leaving them deplete—this too is often untreatable. In cases of deficiency illness, there is generally no external pathogen, so although the disease may be exhausting, it does not cause chaos. If one has a deficiency syndrome, without any other pathogenic heat, and experiences delirium and disarray, this indicates heart failure and the departure of spirit—it is certainly fatal. </p>
<p>If labor causes coughing, loss of voice, or acute wheezing and shortness of breath, this signifies lung failure—it is certainly fatal. In cases of extreme labor where all muscle is exhausted, this indicates spleen failure—it is certainly fatal. </p>
<p>Tendons are the root of fatigue; in any case of deficiency and chronic illness, there are often pains in the muscles and bones. If the pain becomes unbearably severe, this indicates depletion of blood unable to nourish the tendons—this is liver failure—it is certainly fatal. </p>
<p>When exhaustion has persisted for a long time, and one suffers from uncontrollable diarrhea, this indicates kidney failure—it is certainly fatal.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>Discussion on the Difficult Classic of Damage and Evidence</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Difficult Classic,&quot; the concepts of upper damage and lower damage are extremely profound, yet there are aspects that remain incomplete and should be thoroughly understood. Generally speaking, external factors such as overthinking and fatigue damage Yang; when Yang is harmed, the illness necessarily arises from above and descends. Conversely, internal damage caused by desires, drunkenness, and overindulgence harms Yin; when Yin is harmed, the illness inevitably rises from below and ascends. As the classic states: &quot;Illnesses of the two Yangs affect the heart and spleen, resulting in issues such as failure to hide one&#39;s true condition, and similar cases in women when their monthly cycle is disrupted,&quot; which exemplifies the descent from above. Furthermore, the classic mentions: &quot;The five viscera govern the storage of essence; thus, they must not be harmed. If they are harmed, they lose their protective function resulting in Yin deficiency. With Yin deficiency, there is no vital energy, and without vital energy, death follows.&quot; This illustrates the ascent from below. In essence, conditions arising from above tend to first deplete the vital energy.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>Thus, if damage occurs to the lungs, the illness manifests in voice and skin; if damage occurs to the heart, the illness is reflected in blood vessels and complexion; if damage occurs to the stomach, the illness results in improper intake of food; if damage occurs to the liver, the illness leads to pain and convulsions; if damage occurs to the kidneys, the illness results in bone weakness and inability to control urination. This initially injures the yang and subsequently affects the yin; when the yang is exhausted below, there can be no solitary existence of the yin, which is not feasible. </p>
<p>From below to above, the injury first affects the essence. Thus, if damage occurs to the kidneys, the illness manifests as a dried-up source; if damage occurs to the liver, the illness leads to blood movement and muscle depletion; if damage occurs to the spleen, the illness results in excessive phlegm and dampness; if damage occurs to the heart, the illness leads to loss of spirit and soul; if damage occurs to the lungs, the illness manifests as wheezing and shortness of breath. This first injures the yin and subsequently affects the yang; when the yin is exhausted above, there can be no solitary existence of the yang, which is not feasible.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said: when the heart and lungs are damaged, the spirit weakens; when the liver and kidneys are deficient, the body deteriorates; when the spleen and stomach are damaged, food and drink do not nourish the vital energy. Any wise person should observe the causes and take preventive measures against gradual decline. Why worry about potential deficiencies? If one waits until both sources are depleted and then blames the ineffectiveness of medication or the shortcomings of the physician, this is indeed a profound foolishness!<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br><strong>Ginger and Licorice Decoction with Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell</strong>  </p>

<p>The autumn dew atop the hundred herbs is collected on the first day of the eighth month. Grind it and apply it to the acupoint at the heart to treat consumption, called &quot;Heavenly Moxibustion.&quot; </p>
<p>For bone steaming and fever: one tael of realgar, mixed in one liter of urine, ground to powder. Then take a piece of Huanglishi about one foot in square shape, burn it over charcoal for a while, and pour the concentrated liquid over the stone. Place a thin mat on top, have the patient sit naked on it, surrounded by clothing to retain heat, and after three to five treatments, they will recover. </p>
<p>For lung consumption and cough: one tael of orpiment placed in a clay box not tightly closed, situated on the ground and surrounded by dirt, about two inches thick. Use one pound of charcoal, tightly packed atop, burn it until one-third is removed. After cooling, it should be ground into powder; mix with sugar and form pills the size of millet. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with apricot seed decoction. </p>
<p>Bone steaming disease, with external cold and internal heat, manifests as steaming attached to the bones. Its root lies within the five viscera and six bowels and must come after suffering. As bones and flesh gradually waste away, food loses flavor, and the skin becomes dry and lackluster. In times of intense steaming, the limbs gradually thin, and the feet may swell. Grind ten taels of gypsum into powder as fine as milk, mix with water, and take with a small spoon twice daily, while keeping the body cool.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br>Li&#39;s method for preparing milk:</p>
<p>This is for treating five labors and seven injuries, coughs, and upward qi. It is effective for treating cold coughs, clarifying the voice, brightening the eyes and enriching essence, calming the five organs, opening the hundred joints, benefiting the nine orifices, promoting lactation, replenishing energy, and healing weaknesses like coldness and pain in the feet. It supports the lower jiao and strengthens the yin. Prolonged use prolongs life, prevents aging, and enhances fertility.</p>
<p>Obtain milk from the Zhao Prefecture, regardless of its thickness, but select only those that are bright, clear, and glossy; avoid yellow and red varieties. Place the milk in a metal vessel; in a large pot with water, boil it until it bubbles like fish eyes, adding water as it decreases. Cook with less milk for three days and nights, and with more for seven days and nights. Wait until it dries and the color changes to yellow-white, and if unsure, cook longer. The best is after ten days. </p>
<p>Remove from water, and boil again in clean water for half a day; stop when the water remains clear and unchanged, indicating the milk is non-toxic. Transfer to a porcelain bowl, and grind with a jade pestle in water, adding water if it feels dry, keeping it in a thin rice gruel-like consistency. Grind for four to five days until it is smooth and shiny like white fish in text, then wash with water; the parts that don’t fall are ready, while those that do need further grinding. After that, dry it completely. Use one and a half qian, mix with warm wine, and take on an empty stomach, also suitable for blending into pills or powders.</p>
<p>Avoid taking the milk if the water is yellow and murky; consumption can harm the throat and injure the lungs, leading to headaches or persistent diarrhea. If one succumbs, eating pork can counteract the effects. 【From &quot;Qianjinfang&quot;】<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br><strong>Zhongru Jian</strong>: This treats wind deficiency, labor damage, and weakness in waist and legs, helping to replenish and strengthen. Take three taels of pulverized Zhongru, packed in a cloth bag. Use one large sheng of cow&#39;s milk, simmer down to one-third, remove the bag and drink the milk, dividing into two doses per day. If there is no vomiting or urgency, it is suitable for individuals with a weak and cold constitution who have slight diarrhea without discomfort. One bag can be boiled thirty times, once exhausted, prepare another bag. After each decoction, cleanse it with wine to ensure ventilation. The residue can be mixed with flour to feed chickens or can be consumed by pregnant women. This is a formula by Minister Cui. </p>
<p><strong>For replenishing and healing from damage</strong>: Use three jin of white quartz powder combined with black beans, and feed it to calves that are ten years old or younger, giving one tael per day. After seven days, obtain the cow&#39;s milk; it can be taken hot (one sheng), or made into porridge. The manure can be used for growing vegetables. There are no restrictions on its use. It moistens internal organs and nourishes muscles, encouraging strength and health.</p>
<p><strong>For all forms of cough and chest fullness</strong>: Use a fragrant smoke to disperse through the diaphragm. Burn a mix of goose tube stone, realgar, and Buddha&#39;s ear herb, grinding them to a powder in equal parts. Use one qian each time and set it in an incense burner to burn, inhaling the smoke through a tube into the throat, twice daily.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a><br>The original text discusses various Traditional Chinese Medicine remedies for different ailments.

<p>For deficiency and hot illnesses caused by overwork: grind salt into powder, take a small spoonful with water, twice a day, to achieve spiritual goodness. </p>
<p>For exhaustion with parasitic conditions: mix borax, nitre, and rabbit droppings into a fine powder, mold into pills the size of a walnut; take seven pills with one section of fresh licorice and new water, knead to extract juice for consumption.

<p>For men and women with deficiencies leading to unrest, anxiety, dryness and thirst, yellow pallor of the face, inability to eat or drink, or experience thirst before developing sores, or develop boils before feeling thirst, it is advisable to take this medicine regularly to tonify qi and blood, stabilize and harmonize the internal organs, ensuring lifelong immunity from boils and sores. Use six taels of fine yellow astragalus, removing the reeds; half should be raw and half roasted with saltwater, steaming with rice three times, then grind into powder; one tael of licorice, half raw and half roasted until golden, ground into powder. Take two coins each time, mixed with clear broth for consumption. One dose in the morning and another at noon, or it can also be decocted.

If there are blue veins appearing on the chest, use a needle to pierce and observe the blood color; if it is not black, it will heal in seven days.</p>
<p>White phoenix ointment: Ge Kejiu says this treats long-term deficiency, fevers, coughs, phlegm, and coughing up blood. If fire dominates the metal element, take one black-billed white duck, draw blood, and mix it with a moderate amount of warm wine, allowing it to enter the lung channel for nourishment. Prepare the duck by plucking feathers, opening a cavity under the wing, cleaning out the intestine, adding two liters of jujube meat and one liter of powdered ginseng and lily to fill it, securing it. Place the duck in a sand jar and slow-cook it with charcoal, adding a bottle of aged wine three times until the wine is absorbed. Afterward, consume the duck and jujubes frequently for recovery.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a><br>For insomnia caused by虚劳: Grind sour jujube seeds and elm leaves into powder, mix with honey to form pills the size of a walnut; take fifteen pills each time, twice a day.</p>
<p>To replenish weakness: On the tenth day of September, take one liter of fresh, moist wolfberries and six liters of clear wine, boil for five or six bursts, then take out, finely grind, and filter the juice, making sure the seeds are very clean. Expose to dry, then crush into powder and mix with the previous juice, simmering over low heat until it can be formed into pills. Take two teaspoons of this with wine, twice a day, gradually increasing to three teaspoons; this is called wolfberry decoction, which can also be made into pills, taking thirty pills.</p>
<p>Another recipe: Take three liters of apricot kernels, remove the skins and tips from two of the kernels in hot water, and thoroughly mash them to extract seven to eight liters of juice. Place this in an iron pot over a fire, add four pounds of sheep fat and heat until it dissolves, then warm the apricot juice and mix it in. After four to five days, it will take on a golden color and have the consistency of balls; take it three times a day. After a hundred days, one appears plump and fair, unrecognizable to others. This is called summer princess apricot kernel decoction.</p>
<p>Another recipe: Take one liter of fermented soybeans, steam three times, then take one pound of sliced garlic chives, boil with seven liters of water until three liters remain, and divide into three doses to induce a light sweat.<a id="trans-261p" href="#orig-261p" class="marker">[261p]</a><br>Another prescription: If the water pig fat is not suitable, take one sheng, and add a handful of green onion whites. Fry until yellow, then pour into a basin. On an empty stomach at dawn, consume it entirely, keep warm, and lie down until evening. Eat white porridge, which should not be too thin, and after three days, take the restorative medicine. The ingredients include one whole sheep’s liver, one strip of sheep’s back meat, half a jin of fermented flour, and ten jins of goji root. Use three dou of water, boil the goji until one dou is left, strain it, finely chop the liver and boil it in the juice, adding green onions, fermented soybeans, and salt as for a soup. When it thickens like syrup, it is ready to eat; continue this for seven days. Follow the medicinal regimen strictly. </p>
<p>For both the corpse and the lying body which have worms, have the patient lay back with their palms open, cover them with a cloth, and burn incense to fumigate the back of their hands for a long time. If hair about an inch long grows on the back of the hand, white and yellow means it can be treated; red is somewhat difficult, and greenish-black indicates imminent death, this is most reliable. If after prolonged fumigation there is no hair, it is not this condition, but related to labor, tuberculosis, or deficiency; it is advisable to use ginseng and astragalus warming restorative medicines.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a><br>Corpse hauntings: Use fifty peach kernels, grind them, and boil with water to extract four liters; take it all at once and expect to vomit.

<p>Needling and heat therapy</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: If the liver is deficient, the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear, and there is constant fear, as if one is being pursued; address the channels of the jueyin and shaoyang. If qi is rebellious, then there will be headaches and deafness, swelling of the cheeks; draw blood. If the heart is deficient, the chest and abdomen will swell, there will be pain between the ribs and the waist; draw blood from the channels of shaoyin and taiyang under the tongue. In case of transformation of illness, puncture the blood at the xie point. If the spleen is deficient, there will be fullness in the abdomen, rumbling intestines, and diarrhea; food will not digest, draw blood from the channels of taiyin, yangming, and shaoyin. If the lung is deficient, one will have shortness of breath, cannot exhale properly, have deafness and dry throat; draw blood from the channels of taiyin, foot taiyang, and inner jueyin. If the kidney is deficient, there will be pain in the chest, pain in the large and small abdomen, clear pale urination, a lack of happiness; draw blood from the channels of shaoyin and taiyang. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: The sanjiao parallels the proper path of the taiyang, enters the bladder, and joins the lower jiao; if it is full, it causes urinary retention, if it is empty, it leads to incontinence. For incontinence, tonify it; for urinary retention, drain it. When the form and qi are insufficient and the pathogenic qi is excessive, then the evil prevails, so drain it urgently. When the form and qi are plentiful and the pathogenic qi is insufficient, then urgently tonify it.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a><br>When the forms and vital energy are insufficient, and the pathogenic energy is also inadequate, both yin and yang are lacking, and it is inadvisable to perform acupuncture. If one were to needle at this point, it would worsen the insufficiency. If the insufficiency worsens, both yin and yang would deplete, leading to a complete exhaustion of blood and energy, leaving the five organs empty and the muscles, bones, and marrow withered. The elderly would face obliteration, and the young would not recover.</p>
<p>Wherever there is disease, there is insufficiency. Hence, if the upper energy is insufficient, the brain is not nourished, resulting in symptoms like tinnitus, headaches, or dizziness. If the middle energy is insufficient, it leads to changes in urination and defecation, and the intestines may produce sounds. If the lower energy is insufficient, it leads to conditions such as weakness, numbness, and heart disorder, requiring supplementation of the exterior and support below the ankles.</p>
<p>When there is deficiency below, there is numbness; when there is deficiency above, there is dizziness. The deficient areas require support and nourishment.</p>
<p>There are five depletions related to acupuncture: the depletion of form and flesh is the first; the depletion of blood after heavy loss is the second; after excessive sweating, it’s the third; after severe diarrhea, it’s the fourth; and after childbirth and great bleeding, it’s the fifth. All these should not be purged.</p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: if the left hand&#39;s pulse at the guan (the gate) is weak and the liver meridian is absent, there may be difficulties in urination and defecation, with evil qi beneath the ribs. It’s beneficial to vomit and needle the foot’s shaoyang to treat the yang.</p>
<p>With liver deficiency, if vision is unclear, moxibustion of the liver points should be applied vigorously, two hundred times.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a><br>If the left hand&#39;s vessel closes the yang and is devoid of the gallbladder pulse, there is no courage pulse.

Insert the needle between the big toe or at the third toe.  </p>
<p>If gallbladder deficiency, moxibustion on the Sanyin Jiao point at twenty times each, located one foot above the inner ankle.  </p>
<p>If the left hand&#39;s vessel closes the inch pulse on the front and lacks the heart pulse, there is no heart pulse. If there is heat pain below the heart, heat in the palm, frequent nausea, and ulcers in the mouth, needle the hand&#39;s Shaoyang to treat the yang.  </p>
<p>If the left hand&#39;s vessel closes the inch pulse on the front and lacks the small intestine pulse, there is no small intestine pulse. If there is umbilical obstruction, hernia in the lower abdomen, and cold radiating upward, needle the hand&#39;s heart ruler to treat the yin. The heart ruler is located in the horizontal line of the palm, one division in.  </p>
<p>If the right hand&#39;s vessel closes the yin and lacks the spleen pulse, there is no spleen pulse. If there is shortness of breath with diarrhea, fullness in the abdomen, heaviness in the body, limbs unwilling to move, and frequent nausea, needle the foot&#39;s Yangming to treat the yang.  </p>
<p>If the right hand&#39;s vessel closes the yang and lacks the stomach pulse, there is no stomach pulse. If there is sourness upon swallowing with headache, and cold in the stomach, needle the foot&#39;s Taiyin to treat the yin, located one inch behind the big toe joint.  </p>
<p>If the right hand&#39;s vessel closes the inch pulse on the front and lacks the lung pulse, there is no lung pulse. If there is shortness of breath, reverse coughing, and sensation of obstruction in the throat, needle the hand&#39;s Yangming to treat the yang.  </p>
<p>If there is wind-qi asthma and fullness of the limbs, with wheezing and fullness in the chest, moxibustion on the lung point at two times each.<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a><br>The point on the lung is positioned beneath the third vertebra, one and a half inches away on each side.

<p>When kidney qi is deficient and cold, moxibustion should be applied to the kidney point in the lower back, positioned one and a half inches to either side of the navel and directed backward alongside the spine.</p>
<p>The left wrist&#39;s back middle point that lacks the bladder meridian is crucial. In cases of coldness, if a woman has irregular menstruation or a complete loss during her monthly cycle, or if a man experiences sperm loss and excessive urinary dribbling, needle the foot’s Shaoyin channel to treat the yin, which is located below the inner ankle artery.</p>

The thumbs should align with the knees. Using an object to support the elbows allows the arms to move. Starting from the upper corner of the shoulder blade, feel down to the bottom of the shoulder blade; in between, there should be four ribs with three gaps—apply moxibustion in the middle. Inside the shoulder blade, where the ribs are empty, about a finger’s breadth away from the shoulder blade, rub the surface of the bones and flesh in the empty spaces between the ribs. Pressing here should create a sensation of pulling within the chest. Apply moxibustion at each point between the shoulder blades, either up to six hundred or as much as one thousand times. One should feel energy flowing downward in a continuous manner akin to running water, and there should be some discharge. If there’s no accumulation of phlegm or chronic disease, there will be nothing to discharge. If the patient is too exhausted to sit upright, they should lie on their side, with the upper arm drawn forward, to locate and apply moxibustion at the acupoints. To locate the acupoints, use the right hand to measure from the right shoulder to the extent just beyond where the fingers can reach. The left hand will do the same. Then apply moxibustion as previously mentioned. If unable to sit upright for a long time, they can extend both arms while lying down on a cloth. Ensure the two shoulder blades are pulled apart; otherwise, the shoulder blades will cover the acupoints, making them inaccessible. The cloth used should be a consistent size; otherwise, the points will be lost. After finishing the moxibustion, the individual should feel an increase in yang energy. It’s important to take care of oneself to restore the body&#39;s balance. The acupoint is near the fifth vertebra, so align accordingly to locate it.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a><br>The &quot;Jisheng Fang&quot; states: The acupuncture method for labor by Prime Minister Cui, as recorded in the &quot;Wai Tai Mi Yao,&quot; along with formulas passed down in the Cui family and those from Wang Baochen&#39;s experience, are all compiled here, yet they contain errors. In Piling County, there are stone carvings that are most detailed; I have taken various texts and cross-referenced them to create this book, which, compared to ancient methods, is very precise. Following this method to treat people, I have never found it to be ineffective; often, one treatment leads to recovery. I myself suffered from a long illness and weakness in Yicheng, and I also used this method to recover. </p>
<p>Method for locating acupuncture points: First, identify two points. Have the patient stand upright and level. Take a fine string made of wax and ensure it does not stretch or compress. Place it against the firm, muscular part of the foot, with men on the left and women on the right. The front end of the string should align with the tip of the big toe, and the back end should be at the center of the heel. Pull the string back, following the shape of the calf muscle, all the way up to where it meets the horizontal line across the middle of the knee joint. Then, have the patient part their hair to both sides to expose the scalp seam. From the hairline, divide it equally to the back of the head, and then have them sit straight. For the end of the string that you previously cut, align it with the tip of the nose, and pull the string upward, following the seam of the scalp down to the back of the head, then following the spine, guide the string down until its end. Mark the vertebrae with an ink dot (the ink dot is not the acupuncture point).<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a><br>Take another rope, instruct the patient to close their mouth, place the rope over the mouth, bringing both ends to the lips; then lift the center of the rope to the root of the nose, forming a triangle, which will ensure both lips are evenly marked. Extend the rope straight, and at the ink mark on the spine, measure horizontally to ensure it is level, without raising or lowering. The rope is folded in half and marked with ink in the center; then lay the rope out flat and align the ink mark on the rope with the ink spot on the spine as a reference point, ensuring both ends are even. Mark the two ends of the rope with white circles, indicating the acupuncture points. This is the first session of acupuncture at two points.</p>
<p>For the second set of points, have the person sit upright, slightly retracting their arms. Take a rope and loop it around their neck, letting it hang down to align with the tailbone. The tailbone is at the heart&#39;s acromion; for those without an acromion, measure one inch below the two acromion bones at the chest, which will be the tailbone. Make a straight cut and flip the ends of the rope backward towards the neck, positioning the center to align with the heart, directly over the knot at the throat. The ends of the rope hang down alongside the neck, following the spine to mark it with ink. [The ink mark is not for acupuncture.] Take another rope, instruct the patient to close their mouth and measure horizontally to align with the lips, then return to the spine and measure as before with the ink marks. Mark the two ends of the rope with white circles, indicating the acupuncture points. This constitutes the second session. In total, there are four points. Apply moxibustion simultaneously, seven times each day until twenty-seven times. Accumulate moxibustion to one hundred or one hundred fifty times for optimal results.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a><br>When the sore is about to improve, apply moxibustion to two points according to the previous method. For the second set of two points: measure a string to mark the second section, and at the end of the double string, place an ink dot directly above the spine. Ensure that the center of the string is aligned with the ink dot, and at both ends of the string, use white circles to mark the two moxibustion points. The points above are referred to as the &quot;four flowers&quot; from the third application, with each of the two points receiving a hundred moxa each. In total, there are six points after three applications, measured according to the distance from the sun, after which you apply heat. Ideally, the best time is on the third day of the third month. </p>
<p>If the condition improves, be cautious with diet and lifestyle for a hundred days, maintaining a calm and restful environment. If after a month you feel no improvement, reapply moxibustion to the initial points. </p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states that a severe illness causing depletion is fundamentally due to yin deficiency. Moxibustion at the lower abdomen is intended to replenish yang, as the rise of yang allows for the growth of yin. </p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states that if the body feels heat and exhaustion, one should draw it out through the &quot;Po Gate.&quot; For five types of exhaustion leading to emaciation, target the &quot;Zusanli&quot; point.</p>
<p>If there are bone steaming symptoms or heat that cannot be treated, or if there is dryness in the front jaw, target the &quot;Dazhui&quot; point. </p>
<p>Another method: apply moxibustion to the &quot;Jiuwei&quot; point with two sets of seven applications as a supplement.<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a><br>Transmitting the corpse labor, taking from the spring. At the tip of the second toe, measure to the heel and fold it to find the acupoint, needle three-tenths deep, drain six times and absorb once. For symptoms of cold damage and labor consumption, if there is blood it can be treated, without blood it is dangerous. If you wish to draw blood, pierce two-tenths deep, then must snap your fingers. Additionally, for treating phlegm at Fenglong, insert the needle one inch deep, drain ten times and absorb once. For treating asthma at the Dantian, insert the needle three-tenths deep, supplement with two breaths. The &quot;Medical Primer&quot; states: The formulas say for virtual damage and labor consumption, one should promptly moxibust the Huangkong point; this is during the stage of virtual damage not yet established. If one is weak with heat, it is best to moxibust Neiguan and Sanli to disperse the phlegm heat. In the early years, if one wants to treat Yin fire, do not moxibust.</p>
<p>Guiding and stretching</p>
<p>The &quot;Daoist Scriptures&quot; say: Every Gengshen night, stay awake until dawn, the corpse insects cannot do harm. Guarding through three Gengshen nights, the three corpses will be completely severed. Every night knock your teeth thirty-six times, hold your heart with your left hand, and call out the names of the three corpses. The upper corpse Pengju comes out, the middle corpse Pengci comes out, the lower corpse Peng (Wangqiao) comes out, to prevent them from doing harm. Always on Gengshen remove your hand nails, and on Chou day remove your foot nails. On the sixteenth day of the seventh month, burn the removed hand and foot nails to ashes, mix with water and consume it, and the three corpses and nine insects will all be exterminated. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compilation&quot; states: The method for exterminating the three corpses and nine insects through guiding involves crossing your hands on your head, exhaling deeply; sitting and relaxing both legs, with both hands embracing the middle of the feet, then quickly bow your head into your knees, crossing your hands on your head thirty times will cure the three insects.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a><br>Another method: Knock the teeth fourteen times, take a breath at the throat fourteen times, stopping after three hundred repetitions. Practice this for twenty days, and the evil qi will recede; after sixty days, minor ailments will improve; after one hundred days, major illnesses will be eliminated. The three corpses and hidden worms will diminish, and the skin will glow.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: Tuberculosis is due to fatigue, arising from an innate deficiency combined with constant depletion from external factors. The seven emotions are strongly affected, desires exceed limits, essence is depleted and qi is exhausted, fire is stored in the kidney, the heart is disturbed, fire dries the lungs, the lung orifices are unclear, true water does not nourish, and body fluids become scorched, leading to phlegm, cough, bloody vomit, and night sweats. In the afternoon, there is bone steaming, with excess upward and deficiency downward, skin burns and the face turns pale, limbs are weak, and urination is scant and painful. It could be due to the essence not being secured, resulting in harm; or external kidney contraction causing floating qi, leading to wheezing. All these are signs of deficiency and fear; immediate action must be taken to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Guiding method: With palms open and relaxed, casually rub and friction, morning and evening massage both sides of the ribs, kidney points, ear roots, and Yongquan point one hundred forty times for better retention of essence and multiple effects. In the morning, consume human milk wine, drink clean infant urine, or take circulating water, using ginger and jujubes to warm the spleen. Alternatively, use autumn stone salt to nourish yin and reduce fire. If one is too deficient to take ginseng, it is advisable to follow this method to obtain qi and effect. Even for extremely difficult-to-treat conditions, using a few strips of good umbilical cord, dried to a powder, taking two qian with good wine to adjust, proves effective. Avoid anger, eliminate desires, forget words, and maintain quietude. If one can follow their breath, they might revive from death.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a><br>Cultivate energy, focus the mind on returning to the origin, perform the Three Raises and Three Swallows, chant the four-character mantra with precision. Maintain a state of emptiness and hold onto it, dispelling wandering thoughts repeatedly. Focus on a single &#39;death&#39; character, and all worldly matters will return to emptiness. By embracing the principles of simplicity, phlegm and saliva will gradually clear, moving through the channels, utilizing the Governing Vessel, adjusting according to the seasons, there will be divine power. </p>
<p>For red vomit: Initiate thought with stalwartness, backtrack to the origin, combine efforts for a hundred days without interruption, and essence, sweat, phlegm, and cough will be entirely healed. </p>
<p>First, focus on the original source; then use fire to burn out worms, which cannot withstand it and may even fly out of the mouth, allowing the person to avoid them. </p>
<p>For weakness and illness: Start by concentrating on the back, then push outward below the two breasts, rotate down to the two kidneys, then up to the head, and again down to the navel. For heaviness, begin by chanting above the navel, then ascend the kidney water up to the crown, dropping down to the heart and returning to the navel. First chant for the back, attending to the original source. If the body feels hot, it may either ascend to the bubbling spring or rise with kidney water, circulating throughout the body until the heat dissipates.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Report</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot; states: The case of Xu Hua Shumo suffered from virtual weakness and excessive sweating during sleep, with a bluish-yellow complexion, cold pain below the knees, and no sweating, alongside a dry heat in the abdomen. The doctor used ginger and other warming herbs to treat him, forbidding him from drinking water for five days and nights, and also prohibited him from combing his hair, treating him for cold symptoms, according to the practices advised by Dai Ren. Dai Ren said: &quot;Your illness is not difficult to cure, but it is challenging to manage afterward. I fear that once you recover, you will neglect proper care and your condition will return.&quot; Xu Sheng replied: &quot;I dare not.&quot;</p>
<p>Dai Ren first administered pills and herbal mixtures to move the intestines, then allowed him to drink ice water to quench his thirst after the heart&#39;s heat was reduced. Dai Ren also recommended bathing, and within a few days, Xu Sheng’s complexion brightened and became moist. Then, he made porridge with river water to nourish the spleen and stomach, as river water can assist in urination. He combined this with herbal formulations like blood-activating Angelica pills, ginseng and Bupleurum powder, Wuling powder, and wood fragrance and white atractylodes powder. The illness substantially improved; sweating during sleep stopped, his feet felt warm daily, and he regained appetite. Dai Ren often said: &quot;This is fundamentally a lung obstruction, and should be treated with cooling remedies.&quot; He mentioned that water manifests as tears in the eyes, sweat on the skin, and urine below. Normally, grains are abundant while water is scarce; is it possible to completely avoid water? If drinking is forbidden, it will lead to inner depletion, which gives rise to dry heat. When a person is not thirsty, they also will not drink water. After Xu Sheng recovered, he indeed forgot the restrictions, and the illness recurred. Dai Ren had already left, and he subsequently passed away.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a><br>The Medical Case of Xue Ji states: A county official, Han Yongzhi, experienced excessive lust, restlessness leading to thirst, continuous drinking of water, frequent urination with dribbling, constipation, expectoration as if it were surging, a flushed face, a tongue full of prickles, cracked and dry lips, a scorching body, sometimes feeling as if there were prickles with an unstable sensation, and feet so hot as if burned. The pulse in the left three positions was rapid and chaotic; this indicated a deficiency of kidney yin, with yang not being anchored, manifesting outwardly. Due to excessive heat and a lack of cooling, it was determined there was no water, and thus, the yin needed to be vigorously replenished. Therefore, a prescription of modified Eight Flavor Pill was prepared with an ounce of cinnamon; it was decocted in water into six bowls, cooled and given to drink. He slept soundly for half the day, and by evening, he drank another warm bowl, which led to the complete alleviation of all symptoms. The next day, however, he felt chilled, his feet were cold up to his knees, and the symptoms returned, indicating a lack of fire; thus, yang needed to be replenished. Urgently, four doses of Eight Flavor Pill were administered, and all symptoms promptly receded.<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a><br>Scholar Chen Luxian had excessive lust. In early winter, he experienced persistent fever, constant thirst, a buildup of phlegm, continuous seminal emissions, and frequent, aching urination.

In the morning, I prescribed Si Jun Zi Decoction with added cooked Rehmannia and Angelica; in the evening, I prescribed modified Ba Wei Pills, along with Aconite. I also used saliva to externally apply to the Yongquan point, and he gradually improved.</p>
<p>Minister Wang had weak vital energy. In the years Bingwu and Dingwei, due to the stress of examination season, he became ill from exhaustion. By December, his illness intensified; he experienced high fever, profuse tears, red eyes, dark complexion, shortness of breath suggesting near collapse, and a markedly strong pulse that felt hollow. His tongue was dry and seemed prickly; this indicated true cold internally and false heat externally. Therefore, he first took the Ten Vitality Decoction. I said: &quot;Since you have taken this, your pulse should become more constricted and favorable.&quot; After a brief deep sleep, he awoke feeling an increase in chills, and his pulse turned faint and thin like silk, revealing the true manifestation of deficiency and cold. I administered an ounce of ginseng, three dimes of cooked Aconite, boiled it in water, and he calmed down. During the night, his pulse became weak again. I prescribed two ounces of ginseng and five dimes of cooked Aconite and he improved once more. Later, through adjusting with larger doses of ginseng, Atractylodes, angelica root, and honey-fried licorice, he stabilized.<a id="trans-276p" href="#orig-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a><br>The &quot;Classic of Medicine&quot; states: Jin Ru Yuan, a student at the National University, was over fifty years old and slightly thin. Ten years ago, he suffered from an internal injury accompanied by external afflictions. A doctor prescribed a purging remedy, and while the fever subsided after several days, his weakness did not recover. He experienced chest fullness, shortness of breath, and dizziness. He called upon me for treatment, and I administered a tonifying middle energizing decoction, periodically giving him Eastern Garden&#39;s formula for dissipating fullness, and other herbs like dried tangerine peel and zhu ru, to regulate and stabilize him. However, since the root of the disease was not completely eradicated, the dizziness occasionally recurred, though not severely. This year, due to the tough journey to Hangzhou and excessive desires, his dizziness worsened upon returning home. Several doctors treated him with remedies to dispel wind, dampness, and phlegm, including Fang Feng, Qiang Huo, Jing Jie, Nan Xing, Ban Xia, and Cang Zhu, but his condition deteriorated significantly, with fainting episodes occurring over ten times a day. He would regain consciousness briefly, but any movement or turning would induce fainting, leaving his family in despair and calling out for help. They summoned me for treatment.<a id="trans-277p" href="#orig-277p" class="marker">[277p]</a><br>Upon examining the six pulses, they were all floating and rapid. I explained that this indicated a significant deficiency of qi and blood, but fortunately, the pulse was not overly rapid and there was no high fever, indicating that the person would not die. However, I feared that after recovering, they might not be able to rise or move for several years. The patient said: &quot;As long as I have life, I am willing to lie down.&quot; I prescribed a strong tonic for qi and blood, doubling the amounts of ginseng and astragalus, and possibly adding aconite to help guide the treatment, combining a large dosage for three applications a day. Additionally, I prepared ginseng extract and made pills similar to Ziheche wan and Biyin wan for intermittent use. After regulating the condition for more than two months, with over two hundred applications of decoction and three to five doses of pills, using five to six jin of ginseng, the symptoms gradually improved, with eating and drinking returning to normal, but the patient was still unable to move. After five to six years, the patient was finally able to rise and walk as before.<a id="trans-278p" href="#orig-278p" class="marker">[278p]</a><br>In Dongyang County, a school headmaster named Zou experienced severe sweating, trembling, and shaking. For a while, he felt hot, as if his body were on fire, followed by heavy sweating, then a cold sensation leading to shivering, cycling between hot and cold with sweating, resulting in three ailments that persisted both day and night. The student Lu Mingfu treated his intermittent fever without success. He called for me, and I diagnosed his right hand’s yang pulse as rapid and floating, yet weak, and the yin pulse as slightly deep and small, also weak. The left side was notably worse than the right but still floating and soft. I said, &quot;This is a case of yang deficiency.&quot; I prescribed a modified Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, increasing the amount of ginseng and astragalus, reducing the amount of licorice and ramulus cinnamomi by half, adding one and a half qian of urine-soaked aconite, three fen of fried berberine, five fen each of dried ginger and thin cinnamon, and one jujube, to be cooked together and taken. After one dose, his condition improved by a third; after two doses, it reduced by half; and after four doses, the cold and heat ceased, although there was still slight sweating. I then removed half of the cinnamon, aconite, and dried ginger, and after two more doses, he was fully recovered.<a id="trans-279p" href="#orig-279p" class="marker">[279p]</a><br>In &quot;Essential Readings of Medical Tradition,&quot; it is stated: A county magistrate&#39;s son suffered from physical depletion, experiencing seminal loss and sweating at night, approaching danger. He discovered my rudimentary writings on medicines and pulse diagnosis, and sent an envoy to invite me. His letter was heartfelt, and I was moved by his words, so I went to see him. By the time I arrived, his condition had worsened. I reviewed the medicines he was taking, which mainly included the Four Substances, along with Anemarrhena and Ephedra as adjustments. Upon diagnosing his pulse, it was large and rapid, yet extremely soft. I said: “Your central qi is greatly cold, which in turn makes the medicine ineffective.” I then prescribed Gui Pi Decoction with an extra dose of cinnamon and five qian of ginseng, advising that he would sleep soundly that night. After ten days, his sweating ceased, and his seminal loss improved. I further prescribed Shao Yao Dan to supplement his central qi invigorating, and after a month of intermittent use, he began to feel better.</p>
<p>In the year of Bingchen, a young cousin of the Grand Secretary first suffered from fever and fatigue, with blurred vision and tinnitus, legs weak and unable to walk, constipation, numbness in his hands and feet, and pain in his lower back. Upon examining him, I said: “The kidney is deficient and unable to ascend to assist, the heart is also deficient and unable to descend to aid.” His pulse was weak and soft. I recommended the Eight-Treasure Pill and Ten Complements Decoction, adding thirty large dates. After over fifty days, his spirit gradually improved, and his muscles began to fill out, leading him to write to express his gratitude. One day, he consumed a large amount of tiger bone wine, but his constipation persisted. Physicians all stated that the Eight-Treasure Pill was not suitable for long-term use, and that the Ten Complements Decoction should exclude cinnamon, instead using Anemarrhena and Asparagus as substitutes. After taking it for a few months, he ultimately fell into a state from which he could not recover.<a id="trans-280p" href="#orig-280p" class="marker">[280p]</a><br>In the southern capital, Xu Lun&#39;s granddaughter coughed up blood and phlegm. In June, I examined her and found her pulse to be two inches like rotten cotton, with several two-inch pulses. I said: &quot;Gold and fire are adversaries; the lungs should not be abundant, yet they are swollen. The rebellious pulse is evident; there is cause for concern in autumn.&quot; On the fifth day of the eighth month, I examined her again, and the abundance of the lungs changed to a fine and rapid pulse, while the weakness in the kidneys changed to one that was severe and strong. I said: &quot;In the year of Wu Wu, the Lesser Yin governs the heavens; the two-inch pulse does not correspond. Now, the inch should not respond but is instead large; the cun should be floating and large, yet it is sinking and fine. The reversal of the dimensions indicates death; the lungs reaching suspension mean death within twelve days. Calculating the period indicates she would die on the sixteenth day. However, since she can still eat, she has surpassed that time; moreover, both the sixteenth and seventeenth are days of metal, so death is not immediate. On the eighteenth, it transitions to the chilly dew time, which coincides with a day of fire. The scriptures say: &#39;When the hand Taiyin&#39;s Qi is exhausted, the day of Bing is severe; the day of Ding brings death,&#39; referring to the fire days. The hour of Yin is when Qi and blood flow into the lungs; if they cannot flow, then suspension is certain, and she will surely die at the hour of Yin on the eighteenth.&quot; Upon hearing this, Lun wept bitterly. Because she could eat, he still did not want to believe it. Indeed, she passed away before dawn on the eighteenth.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a><br>The grandson of Wang Wangyang, at the age of dancing elephants, suffered from a fever and cough, was weak with dizziness. After two winters, the treatments with several herbs—Zhi, Bo, Qin, Lian—amounted to countless remedies, yet the illness worsened. Upon examining the right pulse, which was weak and soft, it became evident that there was a deficiency of spleen and lung qi, leading to a condition where fire could not generate earth. Consequently, I used a formula to tonify the center and augment qi, adding Schisandra, Job&#39;s tears, ginger, and cinnamon to three qian. After ten doses, the condition improved, and it took two months for him to stabilize. At the beginning of spring, the illness reoccurred, so I instructed him to take the Bao Zhong Wan. After a year, all symptoms never returned.</p>
<p>The head of the Ministry of Justice, named Tang Ming, overexerted himself and as a result suffered from food poisoning from seafood—coughing up blood with phlegm, a feeling of obstruction in the throat, daily evening heat, and finding his six pulses not rapid. The left inch pulse was weak and thin, while the right guan pulse was large and soft, indicating that excessive worry had harmed his heart and spleen. I administered a major prescription of Gui Pi Decoction, adding Salvia, Moutan root, Ophiopogon, and raw Rehmannia, giving him more than twenty doses, after which the symptoms reduced by six or seven. Along with taking Liu Wei Wan for three months, he did not have a recurrence.<a id="trans-282p" href="#orig-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a><br>At the age of fifty, Zhou Fuan from Wumen sank into a life of indulgence in wine and pleasures. Suddenly, he suffered from headaches and fever, and the doctor treated him with Qianghuo Decoction, leading to continuous sweating and a state of unconsciousness. I administered moxibustion to the Ren channel, awakening him after ten applications. A formula of the Four Gentlemen, with the addition of ginger and cinnamon, was prescribed three times daily. By the third day, he showed signs of minor recovery, but was still distressed from analyzing his estate, causing fatigue and anger that triggered a relapse.</p>
<p>I used one tael of good ginseng, two qian of cooked aconite, and ten slices of ginger, brewing and administering until he showed slight improvement. However, with any movement, he would go into a fainting spell, experiencing seven such episodes in a single day, consuming a total of three taels of ginseng. The next day, I provided him with lamb broth and glutinous rice porridge, yet he still fainted two or three more times. By the fifth day, the fainting ceased. He cried to me, saying, &quot;I have been granted a second life, but I wonder if there will be a full recovery.&quot; I replied, &quot;Your pulse has strength, but your vital energy is extremely deficient; it will require three years of careful nurturing for you to fully recover.&quot; Thankfully, he trusted my words and adhered to the treatment plan, using four pounds of ginseng over the course of two months. Within three years, he received six hundred acupuncture treatments and consumed over seventy pounds of medicinal pills, eventually regaining his mobility. With many friends and family discussing his case, had he not relied solely on the physician&#39;s directives, or had he delayed in taking his medicine, few would have survived.<a id="trans-283p" href="#orig-283p" class="marker">[283p]</a><br>The daughter of the attendant Yu Feng Wuyue has been suffering from a fever and cough for nearly half a year. In October, she spat out a significant amount of fresh blood. In one day, she consumed only a bowl of porridge, was unable to digest large meats, had loose stools, and was confined to bed, with a pulse of seven beats. I said: The principle is not to save her, which is widely acknowledged. However, if she can solely listen to me and avoid outside distractions, there is a chance to save one in ten. I prescribed three doses daily, using five qian of ginseng, one qian each of cinnamon and prepared aconite, three qian of astragalus and poria, two qian of rehmannia and peony, and one qian of dried tangerine peel, totaling about seventy doses. After three pounds of medicinal paste were taken, she eventually got out of bed. Three months later, her appetite returned to normal. If one were to discard the established methods, she would surely fall into a deep decline.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states: The doctor Zhang Youlie had a daughter-in-law who, at sixteen, fell ill with a high fever, cough, and phlegm, with no relief for a month. Her appetite decreased, and within a year, many doctors were unable to help. They used the crown of the head for treatment, retrieved a worm that resembled a centipede. At that time, it was placed in boiling oil and then tossed into the river, resulting in her recovery. </p>
<p>A man in his thirties, suffering from persistent ailments, had an increased appetite but could not gain weight. He constantly craved meat, and if he felt the slightest hunger, he experienced abdominal pain and fatigue. Thus, he took the crown of the head powder, which resulted in the expulsion of countless small red worms. Among them was one larger worm, slightly purple in color, with fine hairs on its head. Afterward, he used medicine for nourishment and treatment and also took Zhen Su He Xiang pills.<a id="trans-284p" href="#orig-284p" class="marker">[284p]</a><br>A man of fifty years required several sheng of wine each day; if he did not drink on an empty stomach, both his hands and feet trembled. When he drank one sheng, this tremor slightly diminished, but if he became drunk, his hands and feet would become immobile. It was commonly said that this condition was a sickness caused by alcohol, known as &quot;tremor wind.&quot; After several days of acupuncture and medication with no effect, it was suspected that he had worms. He then took a remedy called “Heaven&#39;s Crown Powder,” and expelled an object resembling a black plum, which had legs and was similar to a spider. Following this, his illness was cured, and he no longer drank wine.</p>
<p>In &quot;Yuyi Cao,&quot; it was noted: &quot;When Jin Daobin diagnosed, the pulse on the left wrist was balanced, while the right wrist&#39;s pulse felt taut like a string under tension. The upward surge was notably sharp.&quot; I was astonished and remarked, &quot;This illness has not harmed the branches and leaves; it&#39;s actually a matter of being stirred internally due to drunkenness.&quot; He said, &quot;It is indeed so. However, I have renounced desires for two years and have taken about a jin of ginseng, and until now, I have suffered no grievances. The only issue is that when I close my eyes and turn my gaze, my body does not feel like my own, as if my soul has departed. I do not know if this can be treated.&quot; I replied, &quot;It can be treated.&quot; After reiterating the treatment plan several times, the meaning of the prescription remained unclear. Upon returning, I spoke to my disciples and requested that a record be established. I stated, &quot;For ordinary people, the right treatment comes easily, and vigorously indulging in pleasure with them can assist in their enjoyment. However, it causes the internal organs to flip and the sinews to loosen, making the hundred pulses sway, merely to provide transient pleasure, without realizing the difficulty of sustaining it.&quot;<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a><br>There was a woman who had not yet departed from life, and in an instant she passed away; it is fortunate that such a malady has a day like today. After two years of renunciation of desires, this is the conduct of a true man, and he may harvest what he has sown in the twilight of life. But I wonder, can he do nothing in this regard? Or is it that he cannot do anything? If he does nothing, it is like the sun rising and the Big Dipper turning; if he cannot do anything, he merely finds peace in idleness. The male and female energies of a person&#39;s body embrace each other and do not separate, which is why there is constancy in a hundred years. The yang wants to rise and escape, but the yin pulls it down, and it cannot detach; the yin wants to descend and escape, but the yang pulls it up, and it cannot detach either. Indeed, the disease may not be singular; the energies may often combat each other, but they must ultimately harmonize. Only through great drunkenness and extreme labor can their regular balance be disrupted. When the two energies take advantage of this chaos, separation occurs. It does not require much; even a small fraction may escape, resulting in a portion that is solitary and unpaired, leaving the essence unable to govern itself. The key to remedy lies in seeking out the gaps and sealing them securely, cutting off the claws and establishing a firm foundation, refining the stone to mend the sky, and this is not mere embellishment of words.<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a><br>If one does not recognize the source of the illness but searches broadly in hopes of some gain, even if one daily takes ginseng, it will only deplete one’s wealth without yielding real benefits. Those who are in the upper forms of deficiency may perceive illusions like spirits; those in the lower forms are unseeing and unhearing, akin to being deaf and blind. The upper-deficient feel light and are drenched in sweat, while the lower-deficient feel heavy, with much flesh turning blue and purple. </p>
<p>In the past, there was a newly prominent noble who, riding a horse, was full of pride and joy; before he could return home, he laughed and then perished—this is an example of upper deficiency. Conversely, there are those who sleep and encounter nightmare-like experiences, feeling as if beaten, with blood oozing from the nine orifices—this is an example of lower deficiency. </p>
<p>When both upper and lower deficiencies occur simultaneously, this is a severe and sudden case, rarely seen. If deficiencies are skewed side to side, with the left from above and the right from below, it follows the same principle of the soul rising and the spirit descending. However, the treatment varies based on whether the condition is newly developed or longstanding, and the cost of medication is significant. For acute ailments, where yin and yang are in discord, it is appropriate to use remedies that address the imbalance.<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a><br>For those suffering from long-term illness, the balance of Yin and Yang gradually enters the body. It is essential to support the original vitality and nourish the right, which should be accomplished with gentle remedies. If a prolonged illness is treated with strong medicines, it may only worsen the depletion. </p>
<p>In terms of treatment: for those with upward depletion, use seven parts Yang medicine and three parts Yin medicine taken at night, guiding the Yin to support the Yang; for those with downward depletion, use seven parts Yin medicine and three parts Yang medicine taken during the day, guiding the Yang to support the Yin. By continually guiding and guiding again, Yin and Yang will unconsciously embrace each other. Even when one climbs high or descends deep, there will be no fear; even when launching an attack, there will be no harm.</p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;When Yin is even and Yang is hidden, the spirit will be well.&quot; This is precisely what it means. A skilled practitioner causes the true Yang in the Kan (water) to rise, resulting in the energy of the whole body feeling as if, at the winter solstice when the first Yang is born, reeds sway lightly in the wind, and heaven and earth harmonize with that Yang. Conversely, causing the true Yin in the Li (fire) to descend, leads to the body&#39;s energy feeling like, at the summer solstice when the first Yin is born, cicadas respond in unison, and heaven and earth harmonize with that Yin. </p>
<p>Indeed, within the body exists the ultimate medicine; how could mere grass and wood possibly compare even to one part in ten thousand?<a id="trans-288p" href="#orig-288p" class="marker">[288p]</a><br>Jin Daobin was presented before the case, and the following year I began to inquire about his condition. Now I will outline the treatment: The illness of Daobin is one of the true yang&#39;s withdrawal. True yang originates from the mingling of parental essence at the moment of conception, forming a small pearl of vital energy, which becomes the foundation of the fetus. Therefore, while in the mother&#39;s womb, it first forms two branches, namely the two kidneys. The kidneys are the water organs, and true yang resides within them. In the &quot;I Ching,&quot; the yang within the hexagram Kan refers to this true yang. Since true yang takes the kidneys as its dwelling, it remains hidden within the water, firm and unmoving, silently managing the whole body, thus capable of sustaining life for a hundred years. However, indulgence without restraint leads to the gradual depletion of kidney water, causing the true yang to start revealing itself. Yang is the force that nourishes upward; when it becomes apparent, the spirit sweats profusely, the eyes gleam, and the face appears flushed. Its exuberance is so vigorous that who can grasp it? The spirit wanders, and there has been no peace for three years.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br>Therefore, every year as winter arrives, it manifests, and in spring it becomes more severe. This happens because there is no foundation to store the winter&#39;s water, nor a basis for the spring&#39;s trees to thrive. Consequently, the waist and spine are strained, the governing vessel contracts and does not relax, leading to dizziness and instability, resembling signs of wind. This all originates from self-harming one’s roots of vitality. The processes of growth, transformation, storage, and flourishing are interconnected; any failure in one aspect serves as evidence of illness. Currently, those who store are few, and those who nurture even fewer, leaving no doubt in the presence of disease. However, I assert that there is room for healing, as there are methods for treatment. Furthermore, after experiencing the changes of cold and heat, yin and yang, conditions gradually emerge, and upon examining human affairs over three years as if in an isolated realm, residing in a besieged city, one cannot predict the day and night of survival; those enduring afflictions will undoubtedly suffer deeply. Thus, I recognize the possibility of healing. Initially, we treat with decoctions, employing three methods within the prescription: one to dispel the cold and rigidity, one to rectify weakness, and one to replenish and stabilize deficiency. True yang disperses outward, just as one searches for a lost child, one must exhaust all avenues, and ingesting this formula indeed yields great effects. Hence, an external approach is employed to guide it, further advancing to treat the root cause.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a><br>The fundamental method of governance indeed possesses opportunities unseen by spirits and gods, which cannot be described verbally. Let us explain it through the principle of observing things. For those who raise a thousand fish, they must place certain creatures in the pond; otherwise, the fish will rise and scatter in a thunderstorm. Although fish tend to hide, they naturally prefer movement. By placing heavy bottom-dwelling creatures, the fish are encouraged to remain still, drawn to the same environment, harmonizing principle with the essence. Therefore, in managing the true yang&#39;s soaring and leaping, one must not rely on tortoises and soft-shelled turtles to pull them down and make them hide. This notion directly aligns with stabilizing the primordial essence and ensuring peace, employing the eight cables to align with the earth’s veins, as previously discussed in the methods of disrupting shells to establish a great pole. However, this method should not be treated lightly; if it is, the fish will become chaotic below. Next, use a method of half-invitation and half-retrieval; then, further, employ a method of firm sealing and reinforcement. Although the sealing and reinforcing method lacks transmission in the world, many wise sages have elucidated its principles.<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a><br>Observing the names of the medicinal formulas, some call it &quot;Three Talents Fengtong Pill,&quot; while others refer to it as &quot;Golden Lock Zhengyuan Elixir.&quot; These serve to seal and lock the true yang, preventing it from leaking outward, which is self-evident—first, one must align their heart with this understanding. The sayings from the ancestor Jing Dun in the previous text, that adding oil makes the lamp brighter and adding ash to the furnace keeps the fire alive, have long been stated before. </p>
<p>Indeed, if the true yang can return to its abode and blend harmoniously with the true yin, then clarity and brightness will manifest within oneself, and one can maintain a worry-free existence for a hundred years. However, the illness of Dao Bin begins with indulging in emotions. Although there may be slight recovery now, if one does not guard against excessive emotional attachment, they will inevitably suffer. </p>
<p>One must accumulate essence to strengthen themselves, gather energy to protect themselves, and build spirit to govern oneself. Furthermore, with a thousand days of steadfastness, one could potentially reach the heights like the heavens, impervious to the damage of axes and hatchets. Should one endure the long passage of time, it becomes challenging to persist. Those who attain success in distant lands, weathering snow at the borders and returning grey-haired, are indeed rare. </p>
<p>In the previous text, abstaining from desires for two years is deemed sufficient for a man to achieve longevity, and this has also been previously stated. Now, when using medicinal stones for rejuvenation, one must not avoid speaking harsh truths. I lack self-assessment, yet I attempt to block the raging tide with a single reed. Is this truly feasible?<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The Commentary on Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>

<p>When the nourishing energy is deficient, compassion cannot flourish; when the protective energy is deficient, it becomes ineffective.

<p>If a person with urinary retention urinates several times a day, and the Taiyin pulse is as thin as a hair, this indicates insufficiency. [Note: The earth&#39;s qi cannot rise and therefore leads to downward leakage; this signifies insufficiency of Taiyin.]</p>
<p><strong>On Pulse Explanation</strong></p>
<p>When there is internal deprivation leading to syncope, this indicates kidney deficiency. [Note: When yang is abundant outside, and it depletes the stored qi within, this results in kidney deficiency.]</p>
<p><strong>On Acupuncture Intention</strong> </p>
<p>When the qi is full and the body is robust, or when the qi is weak and the body is frail, this is the norm; any reversal indicates illness. When food intake is abundant and the qi is strong, or when food intake is insufficient and the qi is weak, this is the norm; any reversal indicates illness. When the pulse is strong and the blood is plentiful, or when the pulse is weak and the blood is scarce, this is the norm; any reversal indicates illness. If the qi is weak yet the body is warm, this indicates reversal; if there is much food intake and little qi, this indicates reversal; if there is little food intake but much qi, this indicates reversal; if the pulse is strong but the blood is scant, this indicates reversal; if the pulse is weak but the blood is abundant, this indicates reversal. [Note: The oppositions of qi and food, and the changes in blood and pulse, are all due to disharmony of intention, which allows for the invasion of pathogenic qi.] Hence, abundance indicates the entrance of qi, while deficiency indicates the exit of qi. When the qi is full, it is hot; when the qi is deficient, it is cold. [Note: The deficient must lead to abundance; when qi enters, it fills up; the abundant must lead to deficiency; when qi exits, it depletes. This speaks to the opening and closing of qi.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If blood combines with yin, then yin is cold and abundant, while the qi within the blood is also lacking. If qi combines with yang, then yang is hot and abundant, while the blood divided by qi is diminished. When blood and qi are lost to each other and cannot harmonize, both become deficient. The emperor asked, how does yin generate fullness? Qi Bo replied: If emotions like joy and anger are unregulated, then the yin qi rises in reverse. When it rises in reverse, the lower body becomes deficient, and in turn, the yang qi escapes; therefore, it is called fullness. The emperor then asked, how does yin generate emptiness? Qi Bo replied: Joy causes qi to descend, while sorrow causes qi to dissipate. When it dissipates, the pulse becomes empty; when coupled with cold food and drink, the cold qi fills the body. Thus, blood weeps and qi departs, which is why it is called emptiness. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sixth Difficulty:</strong> It is said that when the pulse shows a predominance of Yin and deficiency of Yang, and when there is a predominance of Yang and deficiency of Yin, what does this mean? Indeed. The floating pulse indicates a small deficiency, while the sinking pulse indicates a significant presence, hence the term &quot;Yin excess and Yang deficient.&quot; Conversely, a sinking pulse indicates a small deficiency and a floating pulse indicates a significant presence, hence &quot;Yang excess and Yin deficient.&quot; This reflects the essence of Yin and Yang regarding deficiency and abundance.</p>
<p><strong>The Eighth Difficulty:</strong> What does it mean when the pulse at the wrist is flat and the person is dead? Indeed. The twelve primary channels are all connected to the origin of vital energy. What is meant by the origin of vital energy is the root of the twelve channels, which refers to the movement of energy within the kidneys. This is the foundation of the five organs and six bowels, the root of the twelve channels, the gateway of respiration, and the origin of the Triple Burner, also known as the guardian spirit of evils. Therefore, Qi is the foundation of a person; if its source is cut off, the stalks and leaves wither. When the pulse at the wrist is flat and the person is dead, it indicates that vital energy is uniquely cut off within.</p>
<p><strong>The Eleventh Difficulty:</strong> The texts say that if the pulse does not fill after fifty beats and then stops, and one organ is without Qi, which organ is it? Indeed. When a person inhales, it is the Yin that enters; when they exhale, it is the Yang that goes out. If the inhalation does not reach the kidneys or the liver and return, then it can be understood that if one organ is without Qi, it is because the kidney Qi has already been depleted.</p>
<p><strong>The Twelfth Difficulty:</strong> The texts say that when the pulse of the five organs has been depleted internally, treating it with needles will only strengthen the exterior; when the pulse of the five organs has been depleted externally, treating it with needles will only strengthen the interior. How can one distinguish between the internal and external depletion? Indeed. When the pulse of the five organs has been depleted internally, the Qi of the kidneys and liver has already been exhausted internally, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the heart and lungs; when the pulse of the five organs has been depleted externally, the pulse of the heart and lungs has been depleted externally, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the kidneys and liver.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

Can one know if it is fortunate or unfortunate? Yes. When the lesser Yin energy of the foot is exhausted, the bones become desiccated. The lesser Yin corresponds to the winter pulse, which hides and warms in the bone marrow; thus, if the bone marrow is not warm, the flesh does not adhere to the bones, and the bones and flesh become estranged.

The examination of emptiness and fullness shows that soft textures indicate emptiness, while firm textures indicate fullness; itching indicates emptiness, while pain indicates fullness; external pain with internal comfort indicates external fullness and internal emptiness, while internal pain with external comfort indicates internal fullness and external emptiness.

Does the illness inherently possess emptiness and fullness? How is the gain and loss to be understood? Indeed, illness does not refer specifically to the pulse at the wrist but indicates that illness itself possesses emptiness and fullness. For example, if the liver is full and the lungs are empty—wood represents the liver, and metal represents the lungs. Wood and metal should be balanced, and it should be known that metal should balance wood. If the lungs are full and the liver is empty, even with minimal qi, if one needles and does not tonify the liver but instead reinforces the fullness of the lungs, thus it is said, true fullness and emptiness, diminishing the insufficient and increasing the excessive.

<p><strong>Treatise on Exhaustion</strong>  </p>
<p>Men labor excessively, and extreme exhaustion also causes strain. A man with a pale complexion is prone to thirst and blood loss, suddenly experiencing wheezing and palpitations; a floating pulse indicates internal deficiency. A man with a weak, sinking, and thin pulse, without cold or heat, shortness of breath, urgency within, hindered urination, pale complexion, occasionally closed eyes along with nosebleeds, and fullness in the lower abdomen suffers from labor-related conditions.  </p>
<p>The disease of overwork presents with a large, floating pulse, and restlessness in the limbs; it is severe in spring and summer but recovers in autumn and winter, with Yin-cold essence spontaneously emerging, leading to weakness and inability to act. A man with a weak, floating pulse and distended state may have infertility, characterized by clear cold essence.  </p>
<p>In cases of sperm loss, a man shows tightness and urgency in the lower abdomen, cold sensations in the genital region, dizziness (or eye socket pain), hair loss, and an extremely weak, hollow, and slow pulse, indicative of vital essence loss and blood deficiency. If the pulse is slightly moving and tightened, it suggests male infertility; for women, dreaming of sexual encounters indicates the same issue, treated with Guizhi Longgu Muli Decoction. A man with a weak, fine pulse experiences night sweats.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the pulse is tense and large, it indicates depletion; when it&#39;s large, it denotes a hollow state, depletion suggests coldness, and hollowness signifies deficiency, and if cold and deficiency collide, it is termed &quot;revolution.&quot; A woman might have excessive menstrual flow, while a man may suffer from loss of blood and sperm. Symptoms of deficiency include restlessness, palpitations, abdominal pain, nocturnal emissions, aching limbs, hot hands and feet, and dryness in the throat and mouth.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Essentials of Illness in Relation to Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>There are deficiencies in the organs and in the bowels, both upper and lower, each presenting differently, requiring deep investigation. Symptoms include rumbling of the intestines, coldness in the feet and hands, inability to digest food, spontaneous vomiting, skin and hair becoming emaciated, muscles appearing wrinkled, blurred vision and hearing, a broken voice, shortness of breath while walking, and a disordered spirit. These indicate deficiency in the five organs. </p>
<p>When diagnosing the pulse, one must raise the fingers lightly and palpate gently. Observe where the pulse is located to determine which organ is affected. If the pulse feels deep, small, weak, short, and soft, all indicate organ deficiency. For deficiencies, the appropriate treatment is to nourish and supplement, as this is the common approach. Symptoms such as skin itching, bloating of the muscles, inability to digest food and drink, and loose stools that do not cease, indicate deficiency in the bowels. When checking the pulse lightly, it feels slippery; when pressing harder, it feels even. This response reflects bowel deficiency. Assess which meridian is involved, and correct the timing accordingly.</p>
<p>Symptoms such as a flushed face, tremulous movements, hoarse voice, dry lips and mouth, shortness of breath and fatigue, lack of color in the face, and swelling of the jaw suggest upper deficiency. Difficulties with urination and defecation, fluctuations in appetite, heaviness in the waist and feet as if sitting in water, difficulty in walking, surging upward of qi, and anxious dreams indicate lower deficiency. If the patient’s pulse is weak, slippery, short, and small, it all pertains to lower deficiency.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Theory of Labor and Injury</h3>
<p>Labor affects the spirit and energy, while injury affects the physical form. Excessive hunger and fullness harm the spleen; excessive thought and contemplation harm the heart; excessive desires and passions harm the kidneys; excessive routines and lifestyles harm the liver; excessive joy, anger, sorrow, and worry harm the lungs. Additionally, external factors like wind, cold, heat, and humidity cause injury from outside, while hunger, fullness, and labor result in internal damage. Illness occurs from external factors during the day, and from internal factors at night. Vital energy (rong) and protective energy (wei) circulate, functioning according to day and night. </p>
<p>Labor starts with one, then leads to two, which transmits to three, three connects to four, four influences five, and five returns to one. When it reaches five, the pathogenic factors become deep, genuine energy is lost, leading to weakness in muscles and spirit, reduced appetite, and difficulty in movement. When this happens, even if life persists, it cannot thrive. </p>
<p>Thus, the theory on regulating spirit and energy states: regulating spirit and energy, avoiding alcohol and lust, moderating routine, reducing thoughts, and minimizing rich flavors are foundational to longevity. </p>
<p>When diagnosing the pulse, if it is excessively numerous, rapid, thin, weak, faint, slippery, short, long, floating, sinking, tense, string-like, surging, or firm, all these arise from labor and injury.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Transmission of Corpse Theory</strong></p>
<p>The transmission of the corpse does not come from one family’s affliction. When a person’s vital energy weakens and their organs become frail, they are influenced by ghostly energy, and as a result, they contract illness from its malignance. Symptoms may include persistent coughing, a feeling of fullness in the stomach and diaphragm, heavy pain in the limbs, skin wasting away, inability to eat, irregular vomiting and diarrhea, vomiting of pus and blood, excessive thirst, an inclination for singing, a tendency towards sorrow, sudden seizures, or difficulty in urination and defecation. These conditions may arise from consuming food and drink, exposure to wind and rain, mourning the sick or deceased, traveling during the day and night, gathered emotions, or the flow of blood. They can also occur from lying exposed in fields or encountering it by chance in gardens. The accumulation of deathly energy leads to illness, hence it is called the transmission of the corpse.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Symptoms of Organ Deficiency and Exhaustion</h3>
<p>The liver pulse is described as taut and long, indicating balance. If it is strong yet weak, it signifies insufficiency, with the illness located internally; if it is lacking, it results in chest and sides feeling bloated, akin to being captured. In a state of deficiency, one dreams of flowers and soft grass, experiences heat and aversion to cold, has limbs unable to move, and the pulse should be taut and rapid, but instead is short and weak. This situation indicates that metal is overcoming wood, leading to death in ten days if left untreated. </p>
<p>A deficiency in the gallbladder leads to a cold condition characterized by fear, dizziness, and inability to sleep alone. A weak pulse at the guan position suggests gallbladder deficiency. If yang is deficient, it indicates total gallbladder failure.</p>
<p>The heart pulse is characterized by a strong pulse on intake and a weak one on release, resembling a string of beads; when it cycles smoothly, it indicates balance. If strong on intake but weak on release, it signifies insufficiency, with the illness located internally, causing restlessness, cough and phlegm from above, and airflow deficiency below. A deficient heart manifests as fear of people, closing the eyes and wanting to sleep, lack of spirit, chaotic soul and spirit, excessive fear and surprise, grief and lack of joy, pain in the chest and abdomen, tremulous speech, aversion to cold, confusion, flushed face and yellow eyes, along with excessive bleeding. A diagnosis reveals weakness and delicacy in both the left and right inch positions.</p>
<p>Deficiency in the small intestine leads to cold conditions resulting in purulent blood leakage, or even black water, with a floating and weak pulse at the left inch position, soft and unable to sustain pressure. This condition reflects mental disturbance and lack of stability, leading to an empty feeling and inability to speak.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen is weak, there are multiple issues such as a strong desire to eat sour foods, persistent dysentery, inability to retain essence, and an inability to control urination. The pulse is like the distance between a bird&#39;s talons, indicating insufficiency. This internal ailment causes fullness and a lack of appetite, fatigue, weak extremities, excessive salivation, swelling of the limbs, irregular diarrhea, and dreams of eating. When spleen qi is deficient, stool is loose, there may be frequent urination, and sweating may not stop. The five bodily fluids descend, leading to color changes in the stool, while dreams of insufficient food arise.</p>
<p>When the stomach is weak, there is noisy distension in the intestines, leading to slippery diarrhea; insufficiency causes excessive hunger and indigestion. A pulse that is floating and large indicates deficiency, and a floating but slightly slippery pulse also signifies weakness.</p>
<p>When the lungs are weak, there is coldness, leading to cough and breathlessness, as well as slippery bowel movements and diminished strength, often accompanied by a sense of sadness. A pulse that feels fine and light indicates insufficiency, causing internal issues that lead to wheezing and coughing, with blood in the upper airways and signs of illness in the lower. Additionally, coughing may lead to involuntary urination due to the upper part being unable to control the lower. If weakness is severe, it results in exhaustion and shortness of breath, along with a feeling of fullness in the right side of the abdomen and shortness of speech.</p>
<p>If the large intestine is deficient and cold, the diarrhea is variable. Also, weakness can result in a desire for fullness, causing cough and a sensation of a blockage in the throat.</p>
<p>The kidney pulse is soft and equal, but if it is weak, the condition indicates deficiency. This may result in a feeling of anxiety, abdominal fullness in the small intestine, and slippery, discolored urine. Weakness leads to chest pain, dreams involving boats drowning people, insufficient essence in the kidneys, radiating pain in the back and waist, and a feeling of hunger when full. Additionally, there may be hoarseness, breathlessness, and coughing up blood, indicative of kidney deficiency and cold, with the breath feeling nearly extinguished.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment of Diseases of Exhaustion</h3>
<p>In discussing the diseases of exhaustion, one must note that the condition known as labor disease is a major affliction for humanity. Those who suffer from this illness experience a variety of symptoms, and over the course of many years, it can lead to severe consequences, even devastating families, which is truly lamentable! Generally speaking, it can be categorized as transmission of the corpse; specifically, it may refer to conditions such as bone steaming, corpse gas, repeated attacks, corpse exhaustion, labor exhaustion, gu disease, toxin disease, heat exhaustion, cold exhaustion, food disease, and ghostly disease. The term &quot;exhaustion&quot; signifies a blockage that inhibits healing, where the source of the illness remains unchanged. This is known as exhaustion. Furthermore, there are twenty-two variations, or even thirty-six, or ninety-nine forms of this disease. </p>
<p>There exist what are known as the five corpses: namely, flying corpse, fleeing corpse, cold corpse, lost corpse, and corpse blockage. While their names differ, their transmission and variations are likewise distinct. Those who succumb to this disease and find peace are exceedingly rare. Generally, illnesses arising from the five viscera provoke symptoms of aversion to cold and fever, each presenting differently: </p>
<ul>
<li>When the liver is affected, symptoms include a pale face, dry eyes, bitterness in the mouth, and spontaneous sweating, along with anxiety and unrest.</li>
<li>When the heart is involved, symptoms manifest as a dark face, dry nose, mouth sores, forgetfulness, and either constipation or diarrhea.</li>
<li>If the spleen is the source, one may see a bluish face, yellow lips, a stiff tongue, a choking throat, excessive salivation, thinness, and lack of appetite.</li>
<li>In cases where the lungs are affected, symptoms may include a red face, pale nose, sputum mixed with blood, and severe cough.</li>
<li>When the kidneys are involved, one might observe a yellow face, dry ears, chest fullness, pain in the thighs, and cloudy discharges.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also twenty-four types of labor-renewing conditions that can be identified through examination.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Five Exhaustions and Six Extremes</strong></p>
<p>The medical texts record the symptoms of the five exhaustions and six extremes, which are not merely attributed to the lingering effects of physical labor, but largely arise from failure to maintain health, overexertion, opposition to yin and yang, and damage to nourishment and protection; thus leading to the diseases of the five exhaustions and six extremes. The labor from physical work and worry manifests as liver exhaustion, which corresponds to muscular extremes; the mental strain from excessive thinking leads to heart exhaustion, corresponding to arterial extremes; overthinking due to unexpected concerns results in spleen exhaustion, corresponding to flesh extremes; anxiety about future matters causes lung exhaustion, corresponding to qi extremes; and holding onto ambitions and principles leads to kidney exhaustion, corresponding to bone extremes. These five exhaustions correspond to the five extremes.</p>
<p>However, in states of extreme exhaustion, the energies of the five organs and six viscera decline, the body becomes depleted, vision blurs, teeth decay and hair falls out, the body feels heavy and hearing diminishes, movement becomes unsteady, and evil qi disrupts the six viscera and oppresses the five organs, resulting in extreme depletion. Generally speaking, the pulse in cases of extreme exhaustion is often wiry. The treatment methods should adjust according to their excess or deficiency, heat or cold. For those in a state of extreme depletion, one should replenish their essence. As stated in the &quot;Suwen&quot;: &quot;For those lacking in form, warm them with qi; for those lacking in essence, replenish them with flavors.&quot; Roughly speaking, this summarizes the approach.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Diseases of Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>The disease of deficiency arises when cold and heat affect the body due to this deficiency. When cold is felt, it damages yang; when yang is deficient, yin becomes excessive, leading to loss from above downwards. For treatment, one should use warm, sweet, and mild remedies; if the treatment goes too far, it cannot restore the stomach. When heat is felt, it damages yin; when yin is deficient, yang becomes excessive, thus leading to loss from below upwards. For treatment, one should use bitter, sour, and salty remedies; if the treatment goes too far, it cannot restore the spleen.</p>
<p>Loss from above entails: first, loss in the lungs, leading to skin aggregation and hair loss; second, loss in the heart, causing a deficiency in blood vessels and an inability to nourish the organs, resulting in menstrual issues for women; third, loss in the stomach, where food fails to nourish the skin. Loss from below entails: first, loss in the kidneys, leading to weakness and inability to rise from bed; second, loss in the liver, causing the tendons to weaken and lose their grip; third, loss in the spleen, leading to an inability to digest and assimilate food. </p>
<p>It is said that when the heart and lungs are damaged, complexion darkens; when the kidneys and liver are damaged, physical strength declines; when grains cannot be transformed, the spleen is distraught.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>East Garden Ten Books</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Li Gao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Weakness of the Spleen and Stomach and the Remedies for Various Illnesses</strong>  </p>
<p>The weakness of the spleen and stomach is caused by insufficient energy in the upper body. When encountering the hot weather in summer, it harms the original qi, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down, with limbs feeling weak, and the spirit lacking vitality. The feet become weak and soft. In the face of cold mornings and evenings, after the sun has risen high, yang energy begins to flourish, causing a heat that feels like fire; thus, both yin and yang, qi and blood are deficient. Consequently, one may experience heat collapse due to yin deficiency or cold collapse due to qi deficiency. One&#39;s mouth loses the sense of taste, and one feels fiery in the eyes but sees nothing. Urination becomes frequent, while bowel movements become difficult and constipated. Pain emerges in the stomach and heart, the sides may hurt or feel tightly constricted, and the area beneath the navel feels like being bound by ropes, sometimes as sharp as being stabbed. The abdomen becomes hard and difficult to move, the chest feels closed, and one may occasionally experience nausea or cough with phlegm, saliva foams in the mouth, and there is pain in the tongue, lower back, shoulders, and eyes. Headaches occur intermittently, appetite is lost, sometimes even just a small amount of food consumed feels filling, and there is a complete lack of desire for food, often with excessive sweating. If the yin energy returns to the skin, it is due to the heat of the weather aggravating the condition; thus, the metal of the large intestine and the lungs suffer under this heat. The first step is to support the original qi and address the deficiency of the metal elements; the Decoction of Astragalus and Ginseng is the principal remedy for this.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Inadvisability of Using Vomiting Remedies for Spleen and Stomach Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p>The discussion in &quot;Liu Yuan Zheng Ji&quot; states that when wood is stagnant, it should be released; the nature of wood is to be dynamic and elevated. If it is now trapped underground with no outlet, it is akin to wind losing its land. For individuals with the signs of wood stagnation in their bodies, they should be opened up, and one may use methods of vomiting to assist the movement of wood; this embodies the idea of releasing wood stagnation. Furthermore, when wood is released, it signifies that wood has initially lost its nature and been trapped underground, but now, having been opened, it moves towards the heavens, thus it is released and no longer stagnant — wood returns to its nature and becomes excessive. When there is excess, it also includes what it overcomes; the spleen&#39;s earth receives evils, which can be observed in the context of wood stagnation. This is not the only indication. Moreover, the Jueyin, which governs the heavens, is also characterized by strong wind and wood. The triumph of Jueyin is also the strength of wind and wood, both signify that the spleen and stomach are affected, as seen in the previous context, where the discussion is consistent. Some may not comprehend the meaning of &quot;wood stagnation release&quot; and mistakenly treat wood stagnation as a condition needing to be addressed, heavily emphasizing substance, which further subjects the spleen and stomach to the control of wood, effectively replenishing what is excessive while neglecting what is deficient.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the spleen and stomach is already insufficient; how can one not be greatly injured by this? Furthermore, the chest is filled with obstruction, and one must vomit. The gas at the mouth is three times larger than the pulse at the wrist. This indicates food injury to the Taiyin, with pulses above but absent below. If one does not vomit, death is imminent. Since there is no pulse below, it is clear that the wood is congested below, causing the pathways to be blocked and the liver energy to be cut off. The lung metal also obstructs and does not descend, blocked by material. Metal can overcome wood. The liver wood is affected by evil, food obstructs the chest and throat, hence it is said that those below are affected and thus surpassed. Zhang Zhongjing states: to relieve this distress, one should use gourd vine seeds to help induce vomiting. Just as sweating and purging in the classics is referred to as vacuous distress, it is also called vexation. With restlessness and inability to sleep, it indicates wood congestion, which can be treated with Gardenia and fried soybeans soup to induce vomiting. Those in confusion will find their throat blocked, both sides of the chest supporting a distended and insufficient stomach; then, with turbid energy above, one suffers from distension, leading to vomiting. Moreover, if the stomach is weak, it will inevitably become angry. Wind wood has come to invade the stomach, and the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions iron and drops to settle it. How can one reverse and vomit to aid the evil of wind wood? If one does not focus on vomiting but does so, the difference is as disparate as the separation of heaven and earth. Generally, in cases where the chest is congested and there is continuous vexation, one should indeed induce vomiting.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Spleen and Stomach Deficiency: A Discussion on the Nine Openings</p>
<p>True Qi, also known as Yuan Qi, is the essence and energy produced in the initial form. It cannot be nourished without Stomach Qi. Stomach Qi encompasses grain Qi, nourishing Qi, transporting Qi, life Qi, clear Qi, defensive Qi, and Yang Qi. Furthermore, there is Heavenly Qi, Human Qi, and Earth Qi, which are the energies of the Three Jiao. Although they are described separately, they are essentially one and should not be regarded as different names or concepts.</p>
<p>When dietary intake and labor are excessive, one may experience spontaneous sweating and frequent urination. Yin fire then overcomes the position of Earth, clear Qi fails to arise, and the Yang pathway does not function. Consequently, Yin blood collides with fire, creating conditions where the Yangming Stomach Earth is dry on the right and hot on the left, leading to the transformation of dryness into fire, causing fluids to fail to remain.</p>
<p>Moreover, both urination and sweating result in a loss of fluids. When fluids reach the lower palace, they transform into blood. The pulse is the cavity of the blood; if blood is depleted, from where can the seven spirits depend? All pulses transform from this center. Among the myriad of diseases faced by humans, none are greater than wind stroke.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

It is said that if yang cannot conquer its yin, then the qi of the five viscera conflicts, and the nine orifices are not open; if the spleen is insufficient, it causes blockage of the nine orifices, which is called heaviness; if the five viscera are in disharmony, the nine orifices do not open. Additionally, headaches and tinnitus, along with blocked orifices, arise from the conditions of the intestines and stomach. </p>
<p>Let us analyze and clarify: The spleen is the yin earth, the ultimate yin energy, which rules stillness and inertia. The stomach is the yang earth, which is active and never ceases. The yang energy resides underground, and thus it can generate and transform all things; hence, the five movements are above and the six qi are below. The spleen extends one foot, covering the greater warehouse (the upper mouth of the stomach). The spleen receives the essence from the stomach, which enables it to ferment and mature the grains.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energies of the five organs connect upwards to the nine orifices. The five organs receive energy from the six bowels, and the six bowels derive energy from the stomach. The six bowels correspond to the influences of wind, cold, heat, moisture, dryness, and fire from the heavens; these are formless energies. When the stomach energy is balanced, nourishing energy rises, generating warmth, which corresponds to spring and summer. When the yang travels at twenty-five degrees, the peak of yang disperses, and as it descends, yin is generated. When yin descends, it corresponds to autumn and winter, and the pathway of yin represents coldness. If the stomach suffers from illness and cannot nourish, the energies of the six bowels are cut off, resulting in a disruption of the yang pathway, with the yin fire rising. The energies of the five organs, each influenced by a bowel&#39;s transformation, can then nourish the skin, blood vessels, bones, and tendons. Thus, when we say that the energies of the five organs are severed externally, it means that the energy production of the six bowels has first ceased, leading to the five organs being unable to receive energy and subsequently exhausting their energy. The lungs, which originally gather and descend, also govern the five energies; when energy is exhausted, it flows downward and mixes with the spleen&#39;s earth in the lower regions, thus it is said to be burdened. When the stomach’s energy is diseased, it then drips downward.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The scriptures say: Moisture is received from below, and the spleen is the ultimate yin, rooted in the earth. The solid earth fills the source of the nine orifices below; it cannot ascend to communicate with heaven. Therefore, it is said that when the five organs are unharmonious, the nine orifices do not function properly. The stomach carries clear qi upward, which represents the yang energy of the earth. Accumulated yang forms heaven; this is why the clear yang ascends through the upper orifices, enriches the four limbs, and invigorates the skin and pores. Since the spleen and stomach are overwhelmed by yin fire, the energy of grains becomes blocked and flows downwards, causing the clear qi to fail in its ascent, thus disrupting the nine orifices. If there is illness in the stomach, then the original qi of all twelve channels is deficient. When qi is scarce, fluids do not circulate, and a lack of fluids leads to deficient blood; hence, the sinews, bones, skin, flesh, and vessels all become weak. Thus, both qi and blood are enfeebled. Is it not necessary to be cautious with labor, movement, and dietary intake?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In &quot;Ge Ke Jiu Lao Zheng Shi Yao Shen Shu,&quot; seven formulas are extracted. </p>
<p>The life of a person is nourished by the ethereal energies of heaven and earth, depending on the cultivation of true essence to solidify its foundation; thus, diseases will not arise, and the body will remain healthy. If one does not nurture the true essence and does not solidify the foundation, diseases will therefore develop. The true essence’s foundation consists of qi, blood, and vital fluids. I once heard my esteemed teacher say: &quot;Among all illnesses, those caused by overexertion are the most difficult to treat.&quot; This is because overexertion occurs when a person, in the vigor of youth with accumulated qi and plentiful vital fluids, fails to preserve life. Indulgence in pleasures like alcohol and lust leads to relentless pursuits day and night without rest, resulting in the exhaustion of true essence and the depletion of vital fluids. This can lead to symptoms such as vomiting blood, coughing phlegm, feverish bones and body, kidney deficiency, exhaustion of essence, a pale face with red cheeks, dry mouth and throat, unusual seminal discharge, night sweats, and difficulty in eating, with total loss of strength, which is termed as &quot;fire flourishing and metal declining.&quot; In severe cases, it can lead to death within six months; in lighter cases, within a year. Furthermore, if physicians do not investigate the source and do not understand its foundation, some may prescribe extremely cold or extremely hot medicines, blindly treating the illness with no effective results. They do not realize that extreme cold only worsens the inner deficiency, and extreme heat exhausts the inner resources, thus in the world of medicine, there is hardly anyone capable of treating overexertion. My teacher’s method of treating overexertion with medicines was like the archer Yi, whose shots never missed. Now, I will outline the sequence of using medicines. The method of administering medicine is as follows: For those who vomit or cough up blood, first use the Ten Ash Powder to halt the condition; if the situation is serious, it is necessary to use the Flower and Stamen Stone Powder to stop it.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

In Baozhen Decoction, categorize internally the six conditions of shock, turbid urination, constipation, nocturnal emissions, dryness and heat, and night sweats, and use the recipe accordingly. No additional ingredients should be added.</p>
<p>For taking medicine, each day brew a strong peppermint decoction and gargle with it. Chew a Taiping Pill first and swallow it slowly; then hold another pill in the mouth and let it dissolve gradually; do this before going to bed. At night, as the lung orifices open, the medicine must flow into these orifices. This method is crucial.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Exhaustions</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Five Exhaustions&quot; refer to the labors of the five viscera. They all arise from overstraining one&#39;s capabilities, excessive worry and thought, indulgence in drinking without restraint, or imbalances caused by illness, which can accumulate over time into exhaustion. Symptoms include dizziness, eye discomfort, body pain, weakness in the limbs, palpitations, shortness of breath, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, chills and fever, persistent heat in the palms, fluctuating heat sensations, bone heat, frequent nightmares, lethargy during the day, tinnitus, a bitter taste in the mouth, and reduced appetite — all of which indicate injury from exhaustion. While all five viscera can be exhausted, the heart and kidneys are particularly affected. The heart governs blood, and the kidneys govern essence; if essence is depleted and blood is dry, exhaustion arises. </p>
<p>The treatment for exhaustion should prioritize nourishing the heart and supporting the kidneys. Harsh and potent substances should not be used, as a gentle and nurturing approach is preferred for long-lasting effects. Overuse of strong substances like Tianxiong (astragalus) and Fuzi (aconite) can easily activate their yang, as there is insufficient essence and blood to handle such forceful treatments. One must not rely solely on sweet and cooling medicines in the presence of heat, as this can damage kidney qi. Using only hot medicines is akin to adding fire without water in a cauldron; excessive cold medicines is like adding water without fire beneath. This approach not only lacks benefit but can be harmful.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is advisable to use the Ten Complete Nourishing Decoction, or the Shuanghe Powder, the Yangrong Decoction, the Seven Treasures Powder, and the Lejing Jianzhong Decoction, any of which may be selected. One may occasionally take the Shuangbu Pill. If there is unexplained physical weakness, extreme fatigue, and no other symptoms, this is likely due to excessive labor leading to deficient blood and qi, thus one should use the Jieblao Powder or the Heqi Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Angelica. Additionally, excessive speaking and reciting can exhaust one&#39;s spirit, resulting in deficiency, which can lead to loss of voice. In such cases, the Ten Complete Nourishing Decoction and similar remedies should be chosen. </p>
<p>For elderly individuals suffering from illness, if suddenly their ability to speak is lost and they do not respond when called, this is not due to &quot;mute wind.&quot; After some time, with the effects of medicine, nourishment, and adjustment, they will regain their ability to respond. </p>
<p>People with qi deficiency often have trouble sleeping. If there is excessive phlegm with hidden dampness in the gallbladder leading to an inability to sleep, one should not resort to general treatments for deficiency, as inappropriate tonification may worsen the phlegm. </p>
<p>If someone, while seated or lying down, wishes to be pressed or kneaded to find comfort, this too indicates deficiency. For those suffering from fevers or alternating chills and fever, each has been previously addressed; one should confirm if these are due to deficiency from labor and appropriate remedies should be used. If not effective, the Fourteen Flavor Jianzhong Decoction may be used. For those thirsty and unable to tolerate heat remedies, the Seven Treasures Powder with added Mu Xiang and Wu Wei Zi, each at seven grams, is recommended. If there is excessive heat, the Huangqi Biejia Powder or the Ren Shen Powder may be used. For those with a sensation of heat in the palms, indicating a potential onset of deficiency, the Fuling Bu Xin Decoction is appropriate.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the outside may be scorching, the inside fears the cold. In midsummer, one cannot wear only a single layer of clothing. Take Da Jian Zhong Decoction, Shi Si Wei Jian Zhong Decoction, Zheng Yuan Drink, and Shen Fu Decoction. If one has a reduced appetite and fears food causing nausea, it is difficult to rely solely on sweet remedies; it is necessary to carefully consider using remedies that invigorate the spleen, while not neglecting ingredients like powdered sand and dried tangerine peel. If the Jian Zhong Decoction contains dried tangerine peel, Ban Xia, and Fili, it can be used, and deer antler and tangerine peel should be decocted into balls. If there is no nausea and one does not fear food, remedies like Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction and Shuang He San should also have the invigorating spleen ingredients added as a precaution.</p>
<p>For those suffering from insufficient essence and blood, knowing they need to nourish the kidneys, they often desire to seek out herbs like Gui Qi, but if their appetite is already diminished, it may not be beneficial for the spleen. If they wish to harmonize the spleen&#39;s energy, they inevitably must use dispersing remedies, which may further deplete kidney water. Achieving both goals in one move is best accomplished with deer antler and tangerine peel decocted into balls. Thus it is said that to nourish insufficient essence through flavor is wise, and that nourishing the kidneys is not as effective as nourishing the spleen, for the spleen connects above to the heart and below to the kidneys. The Daoist concept of harmonizing the heart and kidneys, with the spleen as the intermediary, reflects this idea. However, if the kidney essence is significantly depleted and the condition is severe, the kidneys cannot tolerate any delay, thus one should not be bound strictly by these theories.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Lao Zhai</strong></p>
<p>In men around the age of twenty, excessive sexual desire can damage vital essences and blood, leading to the condition known as &quot;Lao Zhai&quot; (wasting disease) characterized by deficiency of yin and the activation of internal heat. Symptoms include night sweats during sleep, afternoon fever, persistent coughing, fatigue, low appetite, and in severe cases, phlegm with blood, coughing up blood, or nasal bleeding. The body temperature rises, the pulse becomes deep and rapid, and the muscles visibly waste away. This condition is particularly difficult to treat; in mild cases, numerous doses of medicine are required, while in severe cases, a longer duration of treatment spanning years may be necessary. However, it is crucial for patients to value their lives, cultivate a determined mindset, avoid sexual activities, cease idle thoughts, restrain anger, and regulate their diet to nurture their health. Otherwise, even with good medicine, healing will be ineffective. Early treatment of this condition is easier; once the body shows significant muscle wasting, prolonged fatigue, and a deeply hidden, rapid pulse, it becomes challenging to address. Furthermore, patients must strictly avoid ginseng; those who have previously overused it will find their condition even more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Now I present a prescription for treating conditions stemming from excessive sexual desire, particularly when symptoms include tidal heat, night sweats, cough, and fatigue. Early use of this remedy is advised: </p>
<ul>
<li>5 grams of raw Rehmannia washed with wine,</li>
<li>5 grams of prepared licorice,</li>
<li>5 grams of dry ginger,</li>
<li>10 grams each of Chuanxiong, cooked Rehmannia, and prepared Solomon&#39;s seal,</li>
<li>3.3 grams each of white peony and angelica,</li>
<li>7 grams each of dried tangerine peel and yellow bitter herb,</li>
<li>3 slices of fresh ginger,</li>
</ul>
<p>All boiled in water and taken warm on an empty stomach. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above prescription is designed to address conditions of excessive heat and yin deficiency.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This condition generally corresponds to the deficiency of the three yin, characterized by a lack of true heat and the absence of fire, which is why it manifests during the day and subsides at night, or vice versa, occurring at irregular times. The primary treatment should be the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to tonify; additionally, the Bao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be used to nourish the spleen and stomach. If there is prior damage to the spleen and stomach, the Bao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should take precedence, while the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill is used to warm and preserve the liver and kidneys, often leading to recovery. However, if herbs like Huangbo or Zhimu are incorrectly employed, they can further harm the spleen and stomach, resulting in reduced appetite, increasingly weak organs, sinking of the vital energy, abdominal distention, and diarrhea, which would be beyond recovery. </p>
<p>As for nosebleeds and vomiting of blood, these arise from the reckless movement of false heat due to deficiency, leading the blood to flow erratically with the heat, or due to a deficiency of Yang energy which cannot restrain the blood, causing it to go astray.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, this condition arises mostly during the months of April, May, and June when the fire and earth are in great abundance, while metal and water are diminished. At such times, one should not rely solely on bland tastes, but rather nourish the two vital organs. In the months of November and December, the fire energy lies dormant and doesn’t far from the curtain; it harms the true essence. Thus, by late spring and early summer, one may suffer from headaches, weak limbs, little appetite, and body heat, which are symptoms of summer ailments. Some may exhibit signs of aging, intolerance to cold and heat, and inability to endure labor, experiencing recurring illnesses throughout the four seasons. This is all due to the qi and blood being insufficient, leading to mental fatigue. Additionally, if the essence and blood are not fully nourished, they may decline too early, making symptoms difficult to characterize. If the left wrist pulse is weak or thin and rapid, it indicates insufficient true yin of the left kidney, so one should use the Six Flavor Pill. If the right wrist pulse is slow, soft, or heavy and thin, with a tendency to fade, it indicates insufficient fire of the mingmen, so one should use the Eight Flavor Pill. If both wrists feel weak, it indicates deficiency in both yin and yang, so the Ten Nourishing Pill should be used. These remedies are all to nourish the source of transformation. One should also refer to the treatment methods for prior fevers and subsequent coughs.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Deficiency and Loss</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked: For the disease of deficiency and loss, it is common in the world to use the &quot;Jufang&quot; formula, the Ten Complete Great Tonic Decoction, to replenish it. This formula is indeed a key to various deficiencies. It uses ginseng, astragalus, poria, atractylodes, and licorice to replenish qi deficiency, and angelica, chuanxiong, peony, rehmannia, and cinnamon to replenish blood deficiency. How would you discuss this, dear scholar? I replied: This medicine is meant for both qi and blood deficiency. If one has blood deficiency but sufficient qi, or qi deficiency but sufficient blood, can it be applied uniformly? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states, poisonous medicines treat violent diseases. Every medicine has the potential to be toxic; however, those who are ill can leverage this potential for recovery, while those who are not ill merely invite its toxicity, worsening their condition. For cases of both heart and spleen deficiency, one should use poria to replenish. If one is deficient without sweating and has reduced urination, taking it will be beneficial; if one is deficient but has frequent urination, excessive consumption may lead to blindness; if one is deficient and excessively sweats, long-term use will damage qi and shorten life, because of its bland taste and diuretic properties.

Licorice is a good remedy for strengthening the spleen, nourishing the center, and clearing fire to alleviate restlessness; however, for those who vomit frequently or are bloated and have a penchant for alcohol, excessive use can lead to retention of qi and worsen vomiting and bloat, because of its sweet and mild nature. Chuanxiong is a supreme herb for nourishing blood, promoting circulation, and clearing the head, yet for those who experience bone heat and profuse sweating or have weak qi, prolonged use will scatter true qi and exacerbate yin deficiency, due to its pungent and dispersing properties. Fresh Rehmannia can generate blood and benefit the veins; however, those suffering from weak qi or have an aversion to cold should be cautious as it may harm the stomach and reduce appetite. Cooked Rehmannia nourishes and supplements blood; yet, for those with excess phlegm-fire, there is concern it may obstruct the diaphragm. Ginseng is a remedy for moistening the lungs and strengthening the spleen; if one&#39;s original qi is deficient, it is indispensable. However, for those with a chronic cough, laborious cough, or coughing up blood with stagnant fire in the lungs, taking it will surely worsen the cough and increase shortness of breath, due to its sweet and warm nature which may obstruct qi. White Peony root is a remedy for cooling and benefiting the blood; if there is blood deficiency with abdominal pain, it is certainly necessary. However, for those who are thin and weak, or have innate cold deficiency, taking it may harm the vital energy and is best avoided, given its sour and cold properties.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Labor Exhaustion</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Yin deficiency generates internal heat. It also says: Yin energy, when still, allows the spirit to be stored; when disturbed, it diminishes. If food and drink are excessive, the stomach and intestines will be harmed. It further states: If there is fatigue, the physical energy diminishes, the essence of grains does not flourish, the upper burner does not function, the lower abdomen is obstructed, and the stomach energy is hot, thus producing internal heat. Therefore, to nourish Yin and prolong life, the heart and spirit should be serene and not agitated, diet should be moderate without excess, and one must diligently avoid wind, cold, heat, and dampness. Regularity in resting and activities is essential. Why should there be fear or labor? Nowadays, excessive desires lack restraint, daily routines are irregular, the fires of the seven emotions and six desires stir frequently within, and overindulgence in eating and fatigue repeatedly harms the body, gradually leading to a depletion of true water, the upward blaze of Yin fire resulting in oppressive dryness and heat. There may be fluctuating cold and heat, resembling but not quite being malaria; ancient texts named this condition &quot;Steam Disease,&quot; categorized into twenty-four or thirty-six kinds. Though the names vary, the symptoms are quite similar. Generally, this manifests as coughing, fever, coughing up blood, phlegm, white discharge, nocturnal emissions, and profuse sweating. It may also cause confusion of the spirit, dreams of interactions with spirits, and in women, menstrual blockage leading to gradual decline, ultimately resulting in the signs of labor exhaustion.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Gate of Deficiency</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chen]</p>
<p><strong>Various Deficiencies</strong></p>
<p>Blood represents Yin while Qi represents Yang. If there is sudden deficiency without injury, it is easy to recover. If there is deficiency along with loss, it can also be supplemented, but if the deficiency has persisted for a long time and caused damage, one can only achieve partial recovery through nourishment. Generally, when the pulse is often string-like, a soft and large stringless pulse indicates Qi deficiency, while a deep and weak pulse signifies severe Qi deficiency. A stringy yet weak pulse suggests blood deficiency, while a thin and weak pulse indicates severe blood deficiency. Sometimes, a pulse may be weak at the inch but tight at the cubit, suggesting blood deficiency with heat and excessive sweating. Those who are plump with a pale face show Yang deficiency, while those who are thin with a dark and sallow face show Yin deficiency. </p>
<p>Symptoms such as little appetite, confusion of spirit, inability to store essence, and fatigue in the lower back and chest with muscle and bone aches, along with night sweats and cough, indicate deficiency; even observing one or two such signs is enough. </p>
<p><strong>External Causes:</strong> Prolonged exposure to cold can damage Yang. When it descends from above, it first affects the lungs, leading to skin issues and hair loss; second, it damages the heart, resulting in deficient blood vessels and insufficient nourishment of the internal organs, causing women to experience menstrual irregularities; third, it harms the stomach, preventing food and drink from nourishing the skin.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>治宜辛甘，若淡过于胃则不可治矣。感热久则损阴，自下而上，一损于肾，则骨痿不能起于床者死；二损于肝，则筋缓不能自收持；三损于脾，则饮食不能消克。治宜酸苦若咸，过于脾则不可治矣。又不内外因：惊而夺精，汗出于心则损脉；疾走恐惧，汗出于肝则损筋；摇体劳苦，汗出于脾则损肉；饮食饱甚，汗出于胃，则损肠；持重远行，汗出于肾则损骨。治宜酸苦，若辛散于心则不可治矣。抑论心肺损而色惫汗多者为阳虚，肝肾损而形痿汗多者为阴虚。经云：损其肺者益其气，损其心者补其荣血，损其脾者调其饮食适其寒温，损其肝者缓其中，损其肾者益其精。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Treatment should focus on the flavors of pungent and sweet; if it becomes too light for the stomach, then it should not be treated. Prolonged exposure to heat damages the yin, beginning from below and moving upward: first, damage to the kidneys can cause bone wasting, leading to the inability to rise from bed and eventual death; second, damage to the liver can cause the tendons to weaken and lose their ability to contract; third, damage to the spleen can hinder digestion and absorption. Treatment should involve sour and bitter flavors, but if it is excessive for the spleen, then it should not be treated. </p>
<p>Also, there are internal and external causes: fear can deplete essence, with sweating from the heart damaging the pulses; running in fear causes sweating from the liver, harming the tendons; intense movement and labor can lead to sweating from the spleen, harming the flesh; excessive eating leading to sweat from the stomach harms the intestines; carrying heavy loads for long distances, with sweat from the kidneys, harms the bones. </p>
<p>Treatment should involve sour and bitter flavors, but if it disperses the heart&#39;s energy, then it should not be treated. Further, discussing heart and lung damage with a pale complexion and excessive sweating indicates yang deficiency, while liver and kidney damage with body weakness and excessive sweating indicates yin deficiency. The classics say: &quot;To nourish the lung is to increase its qi; to support the heart is to replenish its vigor and blood; to regulate the spleen is to adjust diet and fit it to cold and warmth; to soothe the liver is to ease the internal; to benefit the kidneys is to replenish essence.&quot;<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the heart is overworked and the spirit is strained, the blood vessels weaken, and the face loses color, leading to palpitations, nightmares, and sweating during sleep; in severe cases, this results in heart pain and throat swelling. When the liver is overexerted through excessive thinking, the muscles and bones become taut, and in extreme cases, dizziness and headache occur. When the spleen is strained by excessive worries, one experiences bloating and reduced appetite; in severe cases, this leads to vomiting, diarrhea, emaciation, and fatigue in the limbs, with pain in the joints, shoulders, and back. When the lungs are overworked due to anxiety about future events, there is a lack of energy, coldness in the chest and abdomen, and pain in the chest and back; in extreme cases, there may be a dry cough and heat from a lack of fluids. When the kidneys are over-restrained, there is pain in the lower back, and one may experience seminal emissions and turbidity; in extreme cases, there is a dirty complexion and spinal pain. These five ailments correspond to the five extremes. If the organs become weak due to deficiency in the bowels, and both the organs and bowels are deficient, the senses decline, movements become unsteady, this is called the extreme of essence, causing weaknesses in essence and vitality, thus it is also termed the six extremes. The extremes signify injury. The seven injuries stem from the causes of extreme exertion: prolonged viewing damages blood, prolonged lying damages energy, prolonged sitting damages flesh, prolonged standing injures bones, and prolonged walking strains muscles. Thinking and worrying over matters damages the heart and kidneys, leading to deficiency in yin and blood; laboring through hunger and satiation harms the stomach and bowels, causing deficiency in yang energy. These are the critical signs of injury. For yin deficiency, one may use Si Wu Decoction, Er Yi Pill, or Shen Qi Pill. For fire rising due to external urges, one can use Si Wu Decoction with Zhimu and Huangbo, or formulas like Zhi Yin Jiang Huo Decoction, Jia Wei Xiaoyao Powder, or Bu Yin Pill.

The ancient monastery states: the heart and kidneys govern blood; the heart dislikes heat and the kidneys dislike dryness, so the medicines for clearing heat and moisturizing dryness serve to nourish the heart and kidneys while draining the lungs and spleen. The lungs and spleen govern qi; the lungs dislike cold and the spleen dislike dampness, hence warming, drying, and nourishing medicines serve to replenish the lungs and spleen while draining the heart and kidneys. The “Basic Formula” generally employs spicy and aromatic drying agents, as they strengthen the spleen and promote appetite; however, when yin blood and yin qi deplete, it causes severe deficiency fire, resulting in a flushed face, wheezing, profuse phlegm, a body burning like fire, swollen feet, diarrhea, and a tight pulse leading to a failure to eat, which can result in death. Alas! All deficiencies stem from the lack of yin blood and yin qi. If true yang deficiency exists, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>The classics say: for those whose form is insufficient, warm them with qi. Nurture and maintain to allow qi to refill, which is not to be misconstrued as using harsh warming medicines for supplementation.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who lack essence should supplement it with the natural flavors of heaven and earth, not merely luxurious food. In modern times, there are those who, without illness, excessively seek supplements and thereby become ill; there are also those who, despite being sick, indulge in supplements without relying on appropriate medication, which further increases phlegm and heat. It is not only about overcoming deficiencies to prolong life, nor is it the way to nourish the heart and cultivate one&#39;s nature. </p>
<p>Furthermore, young individuals whose vital fire is particularly vigorous should especially avoid excessive supplementation. After middle age, one must rely on medicinal foods to support oneself, but this must be done in moderation. It is better to administer treatment gently and not to impose immediate results; otherwise, it may lead to severe ailments. </p>
<p>Generally, those with kidney deficiency should take refined elixirs like Qiongyu ointment, Huanyuan Qiushi pill, or the longevity elixir. For those experiencing decline in hearing and sight, the Huanyuan pill, Sisheng longevity pill, or Songbai fruit pill may be suitable. If the kidney deficiency lacks heat, they might opt for He Shou Wu pill or the Juelao Wuxu Jianyang pill. If there is kidney deficiency with heat, the Baxian Tianshou pill is recommended. For the emaciated, the Dazao pill or Ziheche elixir can be used. Those suffering from blood diseases may benefit from Nvzhen pill, Baiye decoction, Baizhi pill, or Chengjin pill. For wind ailments accompanied by stomach heat, one might use Songzhi pill or Songmei pill. If the wind ailment is without heat, Xiannian rice is appropriate. For phlegm and heat causing urinary difficulties, Fuling decoction is suggested. The weak in qi may require Dan Ren Shen ointment. For dryness of blood, options include Dan Tianmendong ointment or Dihuang ointment. Those with spleen deficiency should consider Baizhu ointment. In cases of both spleen and kidney deficiency, the Jiawei Cangzhu ointment may be necessary. All these are medicines to nourish the nature and prolong life, and should be selected according to one’s illness.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

<p>Yang-type fever and tuberculosis: dry mouth, sore tongue and throat, thick and sticky phlegm, restless pain in the hands and feet, yellowish-red urine, and dry, constipated stools. Yin-type deficiency and tuberculosis: white phlegm in saliva, stomach reversal with nausea, difficulty digesting food, frequent urination, sperm leakage that is thick and cloudy, and loose stools. There are also cases of cough with phlegm where lying on the back is impossible; this indicates a combination of yin and yang diseases, often resulting from the ages of fifteen to sixteen or around twenty, when the blood and qi are unstable, with excessive drinking and indulgence harming the essence and blood, primarily leading to yin deficiency. Occasionally, prolonged external influences like chronic malaria or cough induce this, often associated with yang deficiency. Heat-induced throat ulcers causing loss of voice result in death, as do persistent diarrheal conditions from yin deficiency. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a yin or yang illness, prolonged duration can lead to transformation. In males, the disease can be transmitted from the kidney to the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen; in females, from the heart to the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The five organs will transmit to the six bowels and lead to death. There are cases where only one meridian is affected throughout, or specifically from the heart to the kidneys without transmission. The pulse serves as evidence for diagnosis. </p>
<p>Night sweats and cough may present with blood, or sperm leakage and turbid stools, or diarrhea; in mild cases, these six symptoms may alternate, while in severe cases, all six symptoms may manifest simultaneously.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Labor deficiency refers to fatigue. When the vital energy and blood are exhausted and stagnant, it results in blockages and inefficiencies, allowing evils to proliferate. Furthermore, injuries from fatigue and diet cause the upper burner to malfunction and the middle burner to be obstructed, leading to internal heat from the chest. Any lumps above the neck or within the abdomen, coldness around the navel, or weakness in speech or movement are all caused by the accumulation of phlegm and the stagnation of vital energy and blood. Therefore, one should first focus on opening the stomach and regulating the flow of energy. When the meridian is blocked, the vital energy and blood dry up; if the stomach qi is weak, the medicine cannot circulate. However, one should not rely solely on spicy or aromatic herbs for yang deficiency, nor on bitter or cooling herbs for yin deficiency. Although the formulas like Kai Guan San and Ding Wei San from Dongyuan are difficult to apply now, one should extract their principles and adapt them accordingly.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<p>For a Yin disease, employ formulas to regulate phlegm and Qi. Use Er Chen Tang with extra Bian Zhi, Bei Mu, Mu Dan Pi, Dang Gui, Shan Zha, Su Geng, and a small amount of Sheng Di and Mu Xiang, focusing on reducing phlegm with clearer Qi.</p>
<p>For both Yin and Yang conditions, use Shen Ling Bai Zhu San or San Bai Tang, or Er Chen Tang with Bai Zhu, Shen Qu, and Mai Ya to invigorate the spleen and stomach.

<p>Traditional methods suggest using Sheng Xi San, Fang Feng Dang Gui Tang, or San Bu Wan and Dan Huang Lian Wan to treat heat-related conditions, but these should only be used when the condition is newly onset and the body is resilient.</p>

<p>Ancient wisdom stated that there are thirty-six types of labor illnesses, which can only be resolved through accumulated virtue. Those unfortunate enough to contract such diseases should retreat to mountains or quiet places, maintain a peaceful mind and sit in stillness, often burning incense and biting their teeth, focusing on nourishment while abstaining from excessive desires. Only then can the root of the illness be severed. Ignoring these restrictions and taking medications will not yield results.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The term &quot;emptiness&quot; refers to the deficiency of skin, muscles, tendons, nails, bone marrow, vital energy, blood, and bodily fluids. If men and women labor all day, exhausting their spirits and sapping their strength, alternating between hunger and satiety, experiencing joy and anger, worry and thought, suffering from cold and drinking cold liquids, and indulging in their desires, it is said in the &quot;Suwen&quot;: today, many people are weakened before reaching the age of fifty, treating wine as a common drink, regarding indulgence as normal, getting drunk and entering bedrooms for desires that exhaust their essence and dissipate their true energy. The source of this leads to emptiness and depletion, so how can the five organs and six viscera not become weak? The &quot;Five Labors,&quot; &quot;Six Extreme Weaknesses,&quot; and &quot;Seven Injuries&quot; all begin from here. </p>
<p>What are the Five Labors? Heart labor leads to blood loss; liver labor harms the spirit; spleen labor damages food intake; lung labor diminishes vital energy; kidney labor destroys essence. The &quot;Six Extremes&quot; refer to the exhaustion of tendons, sinews, muscles, skin, and bones. The &quot;Seven Injuries,&quot; as detailed in the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; injure the form and the vital energy, and can be summarized under the concept of emptiness. Generally speaking, the five elements and six energies identify water as only one-fifth of the whole. If one water is depleted, can it possibly overcome the five fires? Symptoms of weakness and exhaustion therefore arise in abundance. Those who are physically weak are most susceptible to evil energies; the first step is to harmonize and relieve them, applying minimal herbs and treating them with gentleness, then gradually adjusting. </p>
<p>If a physician does not recognize that evil energy has latched onto the body and has not been removed, yet proceeds with tonifying supplements, then the evil energy receives nourishment, enters the meridians, leading to an untreatable condition resulting in death; such mistakes occur to countless individuals, which is truly lamentable! The &quot;Neijing&quot; originally doesn&#39;t mention labor as a diagnosis but states that labor is meant to nourish. What is deficient should be supplemented with tastes from grains, meats, vegetables, and fruits—all serve as nourishment.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Today’s physicians do not understand their principles; they only know the method of treating with heating tonics. For mild cases, they use Angelica root, deer antler, and various other invigorating substances; for severe cases, they resort to milk stone and cinnabar, using moxa to heat and dry out the body’s fluids. When the fluids are heated, they dry up, leading to excessive heat, resulting in dry coughs, phlegm, blood, and a clammy fever, along with thirst and a preference for cold; this indicates excessive heat. In severe cases, one may lose their voice, which is irreparable. Yet they continue to administer harsh tonics, causing the death of the patient; the physician then becomes the cause of death.</p>
<p>When a skilled practitioner applies cleansing remedies, and they do not align with the patient’s condition, they are met with unwarranted criticism. Moreover, when they hear of treatments targeting the interior, they hesitate and do not follow, willingly accepting death at the hands of inept practitioners who use heating tonics. Even in death, they do not regret this; it is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Cooling remedies can nourish fluids and clear heat, while heating remedies can dry fluids and bolster heat. Matters in the world all adhere to principles; once the principles are clear, what worry is there about the illness not resolving? If labor manifests as evidence of heat, can it still be supplemented? Only those without pathogens, heat, or accumulated issues, whose pulses are weak and feeble, may be supplemented. It is also essential to observe whether their stomach and right kidney fire are deficient before proceeding.</p>
<p>If the heart is deficient, there will be palpitations, confusion, anxiety with a pale tongue, and they should use nourishing decoctions or amber pills to enrich their heart blood. If the spleen is deficient, there will be a sallow complexion, thinness, clear vomiting or diarrhea, abdominal distension, rumbling intestines, weakness in the limbs, and a lack of appetite; in this case, they should use stomach tonics or appetite-promoting pills to regulate their diet. If the liver is deficient, there could be blurred vision, muscular cramps, a pale complexion, and a state of fearfulness resembling someone about to be captured; for this, they should use Cow Knee Decoction or Tiger Bone Pills to nourish and assist the sinews.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is lung deficiency, characterized by shortness of breath, coughing, a dry throat, it is advisable to use a decoction of bitter orange combined with ginseng, astragalus, donkey-hide gelatin, and perilla seeds to regulate the qi. In cases of kidney deficiency with pain in the lower back and knees, fatigue, tinnitus, and frequent urination with leakage, it is advisable to take an eight-ingredient pill combined with schisandra and deer antler, avoiding aconite and using yam to nourish the essence.</p>
<p>For consumption combined with phlegm accumulation, the symptoms include persistent heat in the abdomen and flanks, while hands and feet may occasionally feel cool around the hours of Yin and Yang. If stubborn phlegm is difficult to treat, it is essential to use an emetic method, or to administer drugs like agarwood phlegm pills or penetrating partition pills. In more severe cases, reverse warehouse methods may be employed. If phlegm accumulation obstructs the meridians, it is extremely difficult to treat when the Taichong pulse and the inch pulse of Chongyang are rapid and do not correspond.</p>
<p>For deficiency disorders followed by pathogenic heat, Chaihu should be used. The &quot;Extended Meaning&quot; states: in the &quot;Classic,&quot; Chaihu is not mentioned for treating consumption, yet in modern formulas it is rarely omitted for this purpose, which can mislead many. The fundamental cause of consumption is often true organ deficiency that has become affected by pathogenic heat, leading to consumption as a result of deficiency. Therefore, consumption signifies stagnation, and one should carefully consider this. </p>
<p>In familiar formulas for treating consumption heat, Qinghao decoction with Chaihu is appropriate. Upon taking it, there are no exceptions; the heat must be addressed urgently. If there is no pathogenic heat, the treatment can indeed worsen the condition. Even to death, a person would bear no complaint. Wang Haizang stated: if there is no true heat, and a doctor uses it, what is there to wait for if not death? Those who use it should be careful. Additionally, one must avoid using Qín, Lián, or Bó hastily with pure cold bitter medicines, as this will counteract the yang.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To use substances like fragrant ointment, greatly helps the Yang energy, allowing it to return to its rightful position. It is also necessary to slightly reduce the Yin fire with some medicine. Ge Hong says: Ghost afflictions are one of the five types of afflictions. Furthermore, among the various malevolent spirits, their transformations can range from thirty-six to ninety-nine kinds, generally causing people to feel sluggish, silent, not knowing their suffering, leading to evil everywhere. Over the years, this accumulation can result in stagnation and ultimately death, affecting others to the point of family extinction. </p>
<p>If one becomes aware of the afflicted state, they should urgently treat with a fresh otter liver, dry it in the shade, powder it, and ingest the powder with water using a small spoon, three times a day until effective. If results are unknown after the first course, further dosages are advised. This remedy is remarkably effective. A master at the Tianqing Temple, through strict examination, encountered a woman who submitted a request stating that the afflicted person was possessed. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed: &quot;It is not my fault; it is another spirit causing trouble, stemming from the patient&#39;s weakened life force.&quot; It had already taken form in the afflicted person&#39;s lungs as a worm, eating away at the lung tissues, causing hemoptysis and a hoarse voice. The master questioned the worm: &quot;Can you still achieve longevity?&quot; After a long silence, when questioned again, it eventually replied: &quot;Only fearing the powdered claw of the otter, if taken with wine, I will leave.&quot; The afflicted family found that following its words led to recovery; this is what I have personally witnessed. </p>
<p>The affliction is indeed similar. Is the otter claw similar to the otter liver? The transmission of dead body afflictions, such as diseases, can pass between family members, sometimes leading to complete family destruction. This is often tied to ancestral debts or linked to geographical factors. Although talismans, incantations, and methods of dispelling with water can remove the ailment, it does not guarantee complete wellness, but if one can regularly maintain their health, healing will naturally occur.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Canon Must-Read</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Deficiency Syndrome</strong>  </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; deficiency syndrome primarily concerns both Qi and blood. It was not until the work of Chao Shi in &quot;Sources of Diseases&quot; that the five organs&#39; deficiencies and the seven emotions&#39; injuries were distinguished. It even further categorized the six elements of Qi, blood, tendons, bones, muscles, and essence, and divided them into twenty-three components including brain, marrow, uterus, vessels, blood, tendons, meridians, liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, bladder, gallbladder, stomach, triple energizer, large and small intestines, flesh, skin, and Qi. The &quot;Principles of Therapy&quot; further divides the causes of disease into as many as ninety-nine types. With this intricate categorization, scholars have become confused by the myriad paths, leading to the erroneous use of formulas, blurring the lines of culpability. Why not adhere to the &quot;Inner Classic&quot;? It succinctly delineates the spleen and kidneys as the governing organs of Qi and blood, making it straightforward and reliable.  </p>
<p>In humans, deficiency lies either in Qi or blood, and all five organs must be considered. The reason for emphasizing the spleen and kidneys is that water is the source of all things, and earth is the mother of all things. When these two organs are in harmony, the whole body is treated, and myriad diseases do not arise. The spleen possesses the qualities of earth; when the spleen is stabilized, it nurtures the mother of metal above, where metal strengthens the source of water. Moreover, earth should not overshadow water; when water holds its position, the spleen is stabilized, which in turn leads to the kidneys&#39; harmony. Furthermore, the kidneys encompass both water and fire; when the kidneys are stable, water does not overwhelm the liver and invade the dampness of earth. Fire can also aid earth in transformation and refinement. Therefore, with the kidneys stable, the spleen will likewise be secure. Sun Simiao stated: &quot;Nourishing the spleen is superior to nourishing the kidneys.&quot; Scholar Xu stated: &quot;Nourishing the kidneys is inferior to nourishing the spleen.&quot;<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The two masters deeply understand that the kidneys are the foundation of life, and they also recognize the mutually supportive functions of the two organs. Thus, although their statements seem contradictory, their essence is actually the same. To nourish the kidneys, one must start with yin blood. Blood governs moisture and belongs to yin, which is associated with descent. When deficient, it tends to rise; it should be gathered and suppressed, thus the use of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. To nourish the spleen, one must start with yang energy. Qi governs warmth and is associated with yang, which promotes ascent. When deficient, it tends to sink; it should be uplifted and raised, thus the use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.</p>
<p>In recent years, the treatment for labor deficiencies has relied on Si Wu Tang with additions of Huang Lian and Zhi Mu, without realizing that all four ingredients are yin and operate under the influences of autumn and winter, which are not conducive to generating all forms of life. Moreover, blood medicines are often stagnant and are not suitable for those suffering from phlegm and poor appetite. Blood medicines tend to be moistening, and prolonged use can lead to loose stools. Huang Lian and Zhi Mu, being bitter and cold by nature, can drain excess heat. It is named for nourishing yin, but in truth, it is drying and detrimental to blood; it is deemed to clear heat, yet it bitterly enters the heart first, and over time can increase qi, which ultimately can assist heat. As for its damaging effect on the stomach, there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>Dan Xi stated: Excess heat can be drained, while deficient heat can be replenished. In cases of labor-related heat, is it deficient or excess? Can it be drained? Those who correct their imbalances often use Gui Zhi and Fu Zi as daily remedies, which are only suitable for those with weak fire. However, for individuals with dry heat in blood and qi, can they avoid the harm of assisting fire? Generally, symptoms of deficiency and labor are often complex; for nourishing the spleen and protecting the lungs, one must consider both approaches. Yet the spleen prefers warmth and dryness, while the lungs prefer clarity and moisture. Protecting the lungs may impede the spleen, and nourishing the spleen may obstruct the lungs.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of severe dryness and heat, where one can eat without experiencing diarrhea, it is essential to moisten the lungs urgently, and medicine to tonify the spleen cannot be omitted. If the condition is severely weak, with little eating and excessive diarrhea, though there are signs of wheezing and coughing, it is urgent to tonify the spleen, while cooling and moistening substances should be avoided. The spleen has the capacity to generate the lungs, while the lungs lack the power to support the spleen; thus, medicines to tonify the spleen are particularly important for preserving the lungs. I have often seen patients with exhaustion die mostly from diarrhea; the cause of diarrhea is often due to cooling and moistening. Can those in charge of fate not be wary of this? Additionally, tonifying the kidneys and regulating the spleen should be done simultaneously. However, if one intends to use sweet and cold substances to tonify the kidneys, yet the person reduces their food intake, it may not benefit the spleen; conversely, if one wants to use pungent and warming substances to invigorate the spleen, but the person&#39;s yin is damaged, it may further deplete their fluids. Both aspects must be balanced, with emphasis on the spleen because the spleen (earth) connects upward to the heart and downward to the kidneys. If there is severe deficiency in the kidneys and the condition is dire, one should not be overly restrictive. It is important to know that nourishing the kidneys should incorporate cardamom and sandalwood, while strengthening the spleen should include ingredients like five-flavor fruit and cinnamon, adjusting according to the time and method. Furthermore, without yang, yin cannot thrive; without yin, yang cannot transform, indicating it must not be one-sided. However, Dong Yuan said: sweet and warm substances can eliminate great heat. He also stated: blood loss requires replenishing qi. And again: solely yin cannot sustain growth. The warmth of spring and summer can promote development; the cold of autumn and winter cannot support growth. Those who are deficient must be supplemented with the sweet warmth of ginseng, aligning with the principle that yang generates yin. Moreover, those with deficiency due to exhaustion can be treated with supplementation; those who do not accept supplementation cannot be treated.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<p>Fortunately, Li Binhai and Wang Shishan have provided detailed explanations for this issue, but old habits are hard to break, and disasters continue to follow. They do not realize that the lung meridian can have heat, and when the lung pulse is pressed, it may feel solid; in such cases, astragalus is genuinely inappropriate.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Causes of the Five Labors, Six Extremes, and Seven Injuries</strong></p>
<p>The Five Labors refer to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. Laboring the heart leads to depletion of spirit and blood, resulting in ailments like palpitations. Laboring the liver results in excessive anger and fiery disposition, causing tears and blurred vision, and potentially leading to rib pain and fatigue, making it difficult to stand or travel. Laboring the lungs, due to excessive worry, depletes qi, leading to dryness and lack of fluids, resulting in dry cough, hoarseness, and constipation. Laboring the spleen from fatigue injures it, causing fever, aversion to cold, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weakness in limbs, leading to lethargy and an inclination to lie down, eventually tiring the kidneys and resulting in yin deficiency, manifesting as cowardice. Laboring the kidneys through excessive desire, producing cloudy discharge and loss of essence, leads to problems where yin fails to ascend and yang fails to descend. If kidney water does not rise, the heart and lungs lack nourishment, causing symptoms like cough with blood. The so-called labors of today originate from these.</p>
<p>The Six Extremes refer to wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire. Each can elicit disease when excessively encountered. Some may recover through medicine but ultimately suffer long-term damage from indulgent influences, compromising their fundamental energy, leading to lifelong detriment.</p>
<p>The Seven Injuries refer to the emotional states of joy, anger, worry, thought, sadness, fear, and shock, which, when excessive, can cause harm. Specifically, excessive thought can gradually lead to consumption-related diseases. Many contemporary ailments stem from the labors of the spleen and kidneys, especially those from excessive worry and thought. The ancient sages spoke of the Five Labors, Six Extremes, and Seven Injuries to illustrate these conditions.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chronic weakness and heat toxins, if accumulated over time, can give rise to strange and harmful creatures that consume the essence of the internal organs, transforming into various frightening forms. This is indeed alarming. When the liver and gallbladder are damaged, it manifests as hairy larvae, resembling the shape of a hedgehog or maggot, consuming the fascia. Damage to the heart and small intestine leads to winged insects, resembling moths or mosquitoes, feasting on blood vessels. Injury to the spleen and stomach results in worm-like creatures, similar to infant earthworms, that consume muscle tissue. Damage to the lungs and large intestine presents as shell-like insects, akin to turtles, shrimps, or crabs, which eat the skin&#39;s moisture. If the kidneys and bladder are affected, scaly creatures appear, resembling fish, dragons, or carp, devouring the bone marrow. There may also be fiery manifestations, akin to terrifying winged insects or owls, with diverse forms that are countless. Whenever a person exhibits these signs, timely treatment is advisable; delay may result in irreparable consequences. The methods of treatment involve firstly replenishing the deficiency to restore the true essence, and secondly exterminating the parasites to eliminate the root cause.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Attached is a discussion on the pursuit of labor by the Qing Ziting.</p>
<p>Transmission of suffering and pestilence arises from the heart being afflicted. When qi and blood are stagnant, this results in the formation of parasites. This is primarily caused by indulgence in food, drink, and lust, along with worries and the loss of genuine essence, leading to such conditions. All parasites thrive on stagnant blood nourished by qi; in the body, the qi and blood represent the vital essence. When qi stagnates, it manifests as masses; when it becomes stagnant in the heart, it results in parasites. All these issues stem from improper thoughts and the afflictions caused by worry. The harms of the Three Corpses and Nine Parasites are matters of significance for practitioners to understand in detail. Among the Nine Parasites, six are transmitted through six generations, while the three that do not transmit are the roundworm, tapeworm, and threadworm. The six parasites may arise from poisonous substances within the organs or may be transmitted through familial habits. At the onset of these ailments, one may experience confusion of spirit and imbalances in qi. It is essential to refrain from indulgence in wine and lust and to regulate one’s diet carefully.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it is otherwise, with five hearts troubled and heated, and experiencing night sweats and palpitations, after ten days one will become emaciated, with a sallow complexion and a glossy appearance. This is the symptom. If one blindly trusts in false masters, prays and seeks blessings, and relies on inept doctors and their medications, the condition will worsen over time. Only then will one realize the severity of the illness. If not careful, fortune and misfortune may turn on a dime. After this person passes away, their brothers, descendants, and relatives will pass it down through generations, potentially leading to the extinction of their family. Generally speaking, within the phrase &#39;six worms&#39;, they circulate throughout four cavities, repeating in cycles. The disease occurs when the wood qi is met, beginning to take hold a day after the start of spring, feasting every three days and retreating every five days, causing suffering and pain throughout the body. As for the &#39;food&#39; of the worms, when they retreat, they return to their cavities and deeply sleep, intoxicated for five days, giving the appearance of temporary tranquility. It is only when they awaken that one may use charms and medication. Otherwise, if the worms are still deeply asleep under charms and medicine, healing cannot occur. One worm occupies twelve holes in the body, and six worms together occupy seventy-two holes.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the first ten days of the month, with the insect&#39;s head facing upward, it travels through four points from the heart to the head; in the middle ten days, with the insect&#39;s head facing inward, it moves through four points from the heart to the navel; in the last ten days, with the insect&#39;s head facing downward, it traverses four points from the navel to the feet. The nature of the insect is already spiritualized, and it is essential to be precise in examination. If one collects the insect without replenishing, it indicates a shallow understanding and reckless behavior, merely wasting resources and ultimately failing to alleviate one’s illness—how tragic this is! The master said: To treat those exhausted by the influx of possession, one must first understand that the righteous and toxic energies coexist; therefore, when the organs become congested, they take on the form of insects. On sunny days, male insects grow longer, while on cloudy days, female insects do. They initially consume the fats of the organs, hence their white color. When the five organs and six entrails are depleted from being consumed, the skin gathers and hair falls out; for women, their menstrual cycles stop; blood vessels are all damaged, and they cannot nourish the five organs and six entrails. After seventy days, when they have consumed all the human blood and flesh, the insects become yellow and red; due to the damage to the muscles, they become emaciated and unable to sustain skin and flesh, and the tendons weaken and cannot hold firm.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After one hundred and twenty days, when flesh and blood have been consumed, the worms turn purple, and they begin to feed on essence; transmitted into the kidneys, they then appear black. Feeding on marrow leads to bone atrophy, making it impossible for one to rise from bed. When the worms exist for a long time, they grow hair, which has a mottled color, drawing in the energies of the five organs and five elements, and when transmitted to three individuals, they can fly, resembling birds with many varieties. Once they enter the kidney meridian, they cannot be treated. According to the texts, taking effective medicine after the worms appear, if the worms are white, one can take medicine for thirty days to supplement; if they are yellow or red, one can take medicine for sixty days; if they are purple or black, the disease has reached its limit, and one can take medicine for one hundred and twenty days to supplement. Furthermore, it is said: if the worms have a red head, they feed on the flesh of the afflicted person, and one can treat them; if the head and mouth are white, they feed on the marrow of the afflicted person, making the illness difficult to treat, and it is best to cut it off thereafter. Thus, the text states: within sixty days, those who treat have a success rate of seven or eight out of ten; within eighty days, the success drops to three or four out of ten. Beyond this period, it is unknown whether one can recover completely, but it may help remove harm for one&#39;s descendants.

There is sharp pain in the back, pain in the waist and knees, a tendency to lie down excessively while seldom getting up, presenting a condition resembling feigned illness. Every morning, the spirit seems intact, appearing as if one is well; however, after midday, the body feels slightly warm and the face lacks color. There is joy in seeing people pass by, yet one often harbors suppressed anger, remaining dissatisfied, leading to frequent irritability. The legs feel weak when standing or walking, there is night sweating during sleep, dreams involving spirits, encounters with the deceased, or numerous frightening experiences. At times, there may be shortness of breath or coughing. Although there is an urge for food, one cannot eat much; death might occur unexpectedly while the spirit lingers. Occasionally, there may be mild benefits, a feeling of emptiness and bloating in the sides, dry mouth and nose, excessive sticky saliva, an occasional desire for sleep, and a growing sense of weakness, similar to a dried fish that fails to perceive its death.

Once the kidneys are affected, it next transmits to the heart. When the heart initially receives the energy, it causes nighttime panic, frequent palpitations, a feeling of suffocation, and dreams of those who have passed away.

These conditions arise from above, resembling each other, hence termed “illness.” There are approximately twenty-two, thirty-six, or even ninety-nine variations.

<p>　　世间发热类伤寒者数种，治各不同。伤寒伤风及寒疫也，则用仲景法；温病及瘟疫也，则用河间法。此皆论外感者也。今人一见发热，皆认作伤寒，率用汗药以发其表，汗后不解，又用表药以凉其肌，柴胡、凉膈、白虎、双解等汤，杂然并进。若是虚证，岂不殆哉！自东垣出而发内伤补中益气之论，此用气药以补气之不足者也。至于劳心好色，内伤真阴，真阴既伤，则阳无所附，故亦发热，其人必面赤烦躁，口渴引饮，骨痛脉数而大，或尺数而无力者是也。惟丹溪发明补阴之说，以四物汤加黄蘗、知母，此用血药以补血之不足者也。世俗相因，屡用不效何耶？盖因阴字认不真，误以血为阴耳。<a id="orig-100p" href="#trans-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Heat from Yin Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In the world, there are various types of febrile diseases akin to typhoid, and their treatments differ. For typhoid, cold-induced ailments, and cold epidemics, the methods of Zhongjing are used; for warm diseases and plagues, those of Hejian are employed. These discuss exterior pathogenic influences. Nowadays, when people see a fever, they immediately diagnose it as typhoid and generally use sweating medications to release the exterior. If the fever does not resolve after sweating, they then employ exterior-cooling medicines like Chaihu, Liangge, Baihu, and Shuangle. If this is a deficiency syndrome, is this not perilous? Emerging from Dongyuan’s theory, the discussion centers on internal injuries and the supplementation of qi. This use of qi tonics addresses the insufficiency of qi. As for indulging in excessive thinking and sexual desires, it can harm the true yin; when the true yin is depleted, the yang has nothing to rely on, thus it also causes fever. Such individuals will surely have flushed faces, irritability, thirst, pain in the bones, and rapid, strong pulses; some may have a weak and slow pulse. Danxi elucidated the principle of nourishing yin, using a concoction of the Four Substance Decoction with Huangbai and Zhimu, thereby employing blood tonics to replenish the deficiency of blood. Why do common practices often yield no effect? It is because the concept of yin is misunderstood, confusing blood for yin.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When considering the true yin within the kidneys, this refers to the original essence. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: those who are cold and then heated tend to draw from yin, while those who are hot and then cold tend to draw from yang; this is what is meant by seeking its true nature. Mr. Wang Taifu notes: great cold yet vibrant, heated without heat, signifies an absence of fire; great heat yet vibrant, cold without cold, signifies an absence of water. He further notes: sudden back-and-forth, at times appearing and at times stopping, indicates an absence of fire; appearing by day and hidden by night, revealed again by day, moving with the seasons, indicates an absence of water. Therefore, one must seek its true nature and govern it. Where there is no fire, one should nourish the source of fire to dispel the obscuring yin; where there is no water, one should strengthen the master of water to settle the yang light. It is essential to use the Six Flavors and Eight Flavors pills, adjusting their intake to replenish the true yin, yielding repeated effectiveness. However, following theories of bitter cold substances like mud yellow bracken and Anemarrhena may lead to damage of the spleen yin and numerous consequences. As a general principle, when illness presents as heat causing thirst, and drinking cold leads to constipation, this signifies true heat, which is widely recognized. Conversely, when one experiences aversion to cold with fever, pulling clothes tightly and curling up, with limbs feeling cold and clear stools, this indicates true cold, which is also easily recognized.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the disturbances of extreme heat and restlessness, where one does not wish to wear clothes and desires to sit or lie in mud and water, this indicates a false heat condition. In severe cases, there is intense agitation, incessant thirst, a tongue like a thorn, dry and cracked lips, a face resembling red paint, the body feeling as if burned, soles of the feet feeling as if seared, expectoration resembling a surge, labored breathing, constipation, and painful urination, with the three pulse positions large and chaotic. At this time, it resembles the symptoms of purgation syndrome, where purgation leads to immediate danger; it also resembles the symptoms of the White Tiger syndrome, where ingestion leads to demise. If using mere pills, the condition will not improve. Instead, one must urgently prepare a modified Eight Flavor Formula, with one pound of ingredients, including one tael of cinnamon, boiled with water to make five or six bowls, and given chilled for drinking; all symptoms will subside. The next day, one must fear a cold pulse deficit, indicating lack of fire, thus needing to replenish Yang urgently with Aconite Eight Flavor Pills to recover. This condition and pulse deviate from the norm, and one must not treat it with conventional methods. In cases following childbirth or significant blood loss, where Yin blood is severely damaged, one will inevitably experience intense fever, also known as Yin deficiency fever; the term &quot;Yin&quot; here specifically refers to the Yin of Qi and blood.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person is treated with cool herbs and inevitably dies, it is just like the case with the Bai Hu Decoction; taking Bai Hu Decoction will certainly lead to death. At such a time, one must not use Si Wu Decoction. The reason is that the physical blood cannot be transformed quickly, while the ethereal essence requires urgent reinforcement. One must use Du Shen Decoction or Dang Gui Blood Supplement Decoction to ensure the formless gives birth to the form. This is the subtle use of Yang giving birth to Yin and must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>Someone might ask: Your discussion is detailed. Both Qi deficiency and blood deficiency are internal injuries; how do you differentiate them? I respond: Your question is entirely appropriate! Indeed, if Yin is deficient, the face must be red, indicating a rootless fire above. If it is a Yang syndrome, the fire would enter within, and the face would not be red. If there is thirst, it means the kidney water is depleted, and one craves water as a means of self-rescue. However, though the mouth is thirsty, the tongue must be slippery, and although the pulse may be rapid, the pulse at the wrist must lack strength. In severe cases, even if the pulse at the wrist is strong and rapid, pressing it will not yield a hearty beat; this is how to differentiate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if one questions a person who has taken cool herbs and finds that the pulse is strong and buoyant, it indicates accumulated fire; they should be lifted and supplemented, carefully avoiding coldness as violating this will certainly lead to death. Practitioners at the bedside should further differentiate with care; a slight mistake could cost someone their life. Be cautious!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The signs of deficiency caused by exertion are described in the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; under blood stagnation, indicating that exertion must harm one&#39;s essence and blood. When the nutritive blood is harmed, internal heat arises, leading to a constant feeling of heat in the five hearts, visions of flowers and fire in the eyes, croaking of frogs and chirping of cicadas in the ears, deterioration of the tongue and mouth, loss of taste, dryness of the nostrils, and difficulty in breathing. This results in food not benefiting the skin, lethargy and excessive sleeping, weak bones and sore feet, slow movement of the nutritive qi, and rapid movement of the defensive qi, as the nutritive blood is pressured by the defensive qi, unable to remain inside and instead escapes outside—either through vomiting or nosebleeds, or from the two lower orifices. When blood loss is significant and fiery heat rushes in relentlessly, the suffering is unending; when the nutritive blood is entirely depleted, what is left but death? </p>
<p>Moreover, there are cases where extreme exertion leads to stagnation without blood loss; here, blood does not escape outside but is merely accumulated within. Over time, this stagnation prevents normal flow throughout the body&#39;s blood vessels, leading to dryness and a lack of vitality in the skin, devoid of luster and moisture. Thus, where the qi flows, the blood remains unmoved, merely accumulating heat as steam, either during the day or at noon, causing intense dryness and heat. Once the steam disperses, a slight sweat may relieve the heat, but if the steam persists, illness may worsen—what more is needed but death? There are also cases where blood is initially lost, later leading to stagnation; when blood is deficient and scarce, circulation becomes difficult, and heat induces stagnation, which is particularly easy to develop. </p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; speaks of deficiency diseases without addressing exertion. Yet, when large amounts of meat become shriveled, when major bones sink, when the qi in the chest rises, and when the five organs each show signs of danger, this too has been well noted.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is no extreme exhaustion, the true organs and pulses may not be visible. However, when withered and depleted to the utmost, indeed the true organs and pulses will not be seen; could there be anyone who does not die? The Qin Yue people began to discuss the theory of deficiency, stating that when one is deficient and encounters cold, it depletes the yang. When the yang is deficient, the yin becomes excessive, leading to damage that descends from above. First, damage to the lungs causes the skin to gather, leading to hair loss; second, damage to the heart prevents the blood vessels from nourishing the organs; third, damage to the stomach results in food not benefiting the skin. Conversely, when deficient and encountering heat, it depletes the yin, and when the yin is deficient, the yang becomes excessive, leading to damage that ascends from below. First, damage to the kidneys causes weakness in the bones, preventing one from getting out of bed; second, damage to the liver causes the tendons to loosen, making it unable to contract; third, damage to the spleen prevents food from being digested.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who approach from above, if they overindulge in food, cannot be cured; those who approach from below, if they neglect the spleen, also cannot be cured. This is because excessive eating can naturally produce blood, while insufficient eating means blood cannot be generated. Without the production of blood, the yin cannot adequately support the yang, leading to damage to all five organs. The people of Yue emphasize the importance of the spleen and stomach—how insightful this is! Regarding Zhongjing, the texts of the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; summarize its main ideas, stating that essence is produced from grain, and if grain intake is low, blood will not be produced, thus the blood cannot transform into essence. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if there is insufficient essence, it must be replenished with flavors. Flavors refer to the tastes of the five grains. By supplementing with flavors and moderating effort, the reserves gradually become abundant, and great misfortune is avoided. If one uses a small mouth of a chicken for the output of a large cow, can one expect it to not become weak? Thus, the ten teachings emphasize the dual deficiency of vital energy and blood in healthy men, illustrating the signs of deficiency labor as clear as a finger pointing.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Men, in their pursuit of desires, often overlook the loss of essence. They indulge without recognizing that their vitality diminishes daily. Their food loses flavor, and as they grow weary, they also grow weaker. This cycle of labor and exhaustion affects their pulse, their complexion lacks luster, and their bodily fluids decrease, leading to thirst and diminished urination. In severe cases, they may experience blurred vision, nosebleeds, and involuntary emissions; they sweat profusely and tremble, filled with fear and anxiety. When the blood fails to transform into essence, it leads to blood stagnation. This stagnation prevents the generation of new blood and causes the already existing blood to become stagnant and uncirculated. As blood stagnates, the nutrients become deficient, resulting in fever. Prolonged heat then steams the stagnated blood, transforming it into parasites, ultimately leading to consumptive illnesses. Extreme conditions exhaust a person&#39;s vitality, nourishing the parasites; when a person dies, the parasites also perish.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

Consequently, later generations faced confusion due to the multitude of paths available, leaving them unsure of what to follow. They even referred to it as phlegm and fire, leading to misguided notions about phlegm and fire being either deficient or excessive, resulting in an abundance of prescriptions that misapply treatments for lung deficiency and lung excess, as well as for the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. This led to the erroneous addition of real damage to the discussion of deficiency and exhaustion, displaying a lamentable ignorance. Zhang Zhongjing cautioned men about the importance of nourishing and protecting one&#39;s vitality, emphasizing that grains are treasures. By continually regulating nourishment and safeguarding one&#39;s essence, one ensures longevity. One should accumulate energy firmly and practice moderation in desires to sustain this essence.

Those who follow the remedies for kidney supplementation in later generations, along countless paths, in treating deficiency and fatigue, rarely achieve completeness. Is it not merely copying others and providing empty talk? When the blood stagnates and does not flow, Zhongjing urgently seeks to drive out the old and generate the new, hoping to catch the moment before fatigue and illness fully develop. There may indeed be profound methods, but common practices cannot apply them. Observe how a young person&#39;s organs are delicate. With a mere accumulation of cold and heat, it becomes easy for them to develop lumps and consumptive lesions. Once blood stagnates and does not flow, and vitality vaporizes with heat, intervention becomes impossible. For women, if the blood is deficient and the menses cease, and fever persists, the signs of fatigue and illness become more pronounced. Waiting until this condition solidifies, even with effective methods, they cannot be treated.

The Yellow Emperor asked, what is &quot;heavy deficiency&quot;? Qi Bo replied that it refers to the pulse being weak, with both the superficial and deep aspects being deficient. When the qi is deficient, it is said to be irregular, meaning the pulse is without consistency. When the pulse is weak, it indicates unstable movement, suggesting that one’s gait is unsteady. The weak pulse does not resemble the fullness of the Taiyin pulse in the hand; this concept is easy to understand. </p>
<p>The irregularity of the pulse has traditionally been attributed to a deficiency of Yang energy in the upper jiao, resulting in an unstable pulse. If this is the case, then a deficiency of Yin energy in the lower jiao leads to even greater irregularities. The subsequent text states that a slippery pulse indicates vitality, while a choppy pulse suggests death. A choppy pulse signifies that death is imminent, and if the cun pulse is also irregular, how can it signify life? Therefore, the term referring to qi deficiency indicates irregularity. This specifically points to the artery under the left breast. </p>
<p>Where there is regularity, the ancestral qi is not deficient; where there is irregularity, the ancestral qi is greatly deficient, and thus the qi of the upper jiao becomes increasingly insufficient. Later discussions on pulse diagnosis neglect this subtlety, merely refining upon the observations of previous scholars regarding the pulse, asserting that a soft pulse is deficient, a slow pulse indicates deficiency, a stagnant pulse suggests deficiency, a wiry pulse indicates a moderate deficiency, and a thin pulse suggests both blood and qi are deficient. A small pulse suggests low blood and qi, while a heavy, small, and delayed pulse indicates an escape of qi.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse of deficiency and damage can be summarized in a few words, yet it cannot fully express its depth. It is thanks to Zhongjing that it has been named &quot;deficiency labor.&quot; The pulse of deficiency labor is often characterized by being floating and large, which should be considered alongside whether it is floating and large in previous discussions on pulse. Therefore, it is said: a man with a large, floating pulse indicates labor, and extreme deficiency also indicates labor. Moreover, a floating pulse suggests internal deficiency. It is stated that the illness of labor presents a floating and large pulse, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet, worsening in spring and summer, but recovering in autumn and winter. A man with a floating, weak, and slack pulse may suffer from infertility. If the pulse is knotted and slightly tense, it suggests the man has lost essence or that a woman dreams of unions. An extremely weak and slack pulse may indicate loss of essence due to depletion of blood. A weak and thin pulse is conducive to spontaneous sweating. In summary, it is stated: a pulse that is tight and large signifies reduction; a large pulse indicates vacuity; reduction signifies coldness; and vacuity indicates deficiency. When deficiency and cold combat each other, this is termed as &quot;reform.&quot; For women, this can lead to abnormal discharge after childbirth; for men, it implies loss of blood and essence. It is evident that a large and floating pulse appears well outwardly but actually hides a lack internally. One cannot escape the nuances beneath the fingers, and the symptoms of diseases cannot help but reflect back in one&#39;s chest. Zhongjing&#39;s continuance from the past to the present is not merely casual. Though I, Chang, may be foolish and incapable, I have placed the discussion of vital energy at the scroll&#39;s beginning, elaborating the significance concerning the essence and energy of the chest. This was in response to Qibo&#39;s indication of the pulse as being vacuous, highlighting the importance of recognizing the severity of the vacuous pulse; the essence beneath the breast certainly warrants diagnosis. Thus, the indications may be expressed beneath the hall, yet it is not necessarily endorsed by those above, but one cannot dismiss it as a novice outside the door.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>　　　　　Mixed Discussions</p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states: When the form and qi are both insufficient, it is inadequate to use acupuncture. If one were to puncture despite this deficiency, it would exhaust both yin and yang, leading to a depletion of qi and blood, emptying of the five organs, and withering of the bones and marrow. The elderly would be completely extinguished, and the young would not recover. The &quot;form&quot; refers to the physical body; &quot;qi&quot; refers to the breath inhaled through the mouth and nose. When the physical body diminishes, those who appear strong and robust are starkly different. When breathing is labored and short, insufficient to sustain life, it is distinctly different from someone whose body and energy are not hurried by toil. Insufficient pathogenic qi leads to lethargy and weakness, indicating a deficiency of the righteous qi inside, markedly different from external evils that darken the spirit and cause an increase in symptoms. In such cases, acupuncture should not be employed; instead, one should supplement it with sweet herbs. Sweet herbs are used to nourish and support the center, providing good medicine to nourish the organs and enable the circulation of blood. This method is strictly observed by Zhongjing; others like Dongyuan and Danxi also follow this principle. However, Dongyuan corroborates it with internal injuries rather than external influences, while Danxi supports it in cases of yin deficiency, not addressing the loss of yang. This distinction is the weight of the learned and the worthy within the sacred domain.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The people of Qin and Yue invented a theory of deficiency and damage, granted access to the sacred domain. Although there are no specific texts to consult, their methods for treating deficiencies involve: for lung deficiency, enhancing qi; for heart deficiency, regulating the flow of nourishment and defense; for spleen deficiency, adjusting diet according to cold and heat; for liver deficiency, alleviating internal issues; and for kidney deficiency, enriching essence. This is indeed the essence of the rightful teachings. If the eighty-one difficulties are all treated in this manner, what concern is there that future generations will lack resources?</p>
<p>The original qi deficiency differs from damage due to deficiency; original qi deficiency can be restored, while damage is difficult to recover from. There are also two types of deficiency diseases: those caused by illness leading to deficiency can recover with gentle adjustments, whereas those where deficiency leads to damage result in compounding deficiencies, making recovery extremely difficult.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when illness leads to deficiency, the methods of Dongyuan and Danxi are essential; if deficiency accumulates further, it will result in damage, and the original qi will be profoundly depleted. Danxi often uses ginseng paste up to ten or more pounds, with many recovering, which seems to align closely with Dongyuan’s approach. Thus, Danxi&#39;s theory of nourishing yin is merely addressing the tendency of saving people to be overly focused on nourishing yang; how could one encounter yang deficiency and not find relief through rotation (of treatments)?</p>
<p>Diet and overexertion are the causes of internal injury to original qi, resulting in true yang descending and the internal generation of vacuous heat. The theory of Shuyang enhancing middle qi recommends the use of herbs like ginseng and astragalus, which are sweet and warm, to greatly replenish qi and elevate what has fallen—this is the use of qi tonics to replenish what is deficient in qi. On the other hand, if one exhausts their mind with passions, injuring true yin, the yin blood will be harmed, leading to an excess of yang qi that transforms into fire; this is termed the syndrome of yin deficiency and excess fire, which manifests as chronic fatigue or consumption.</p>
<p>Hence, Danxi’s theory on excess yang and insufficient yin proposes using Siwu Decoction, supplemented with Zhimu and Huangbai, to replenish yin, thereby reducing fire; this is the application of blood tonics to replenish what is deficient in blood.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To benefit qi and nourish yin, one method addresses the descent of yang qi to replenish it for elevation, while the other deals with the ascent of yang fire to nourish yin for descent. The elevation and descent are distinctly different, representing two major approaches in medicine that must be thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>Danxi discusses that labor and consumption are primarily due to yin deficiency. From the Zi (Rat) to Si (Snake) hours is yang, and from Wu (Horse) to Hai (Pig) is yin. When yin is deficient, heat appears from late morning to early night; wakefulness is yang and sleep is yin, leading to sweating that happens at night due to yin deficiency; elevation is yang and descent is yin, so if yin is deficient, the qi does not descend, causing phlegm and fluids to rise endlessly; a floating pulse is yang and a deep pulse is yin, with yin deficiency leading to a floating pulse that is large and a deep pulse that is empty. These are all signs of yin deficiency, treated with the Si Wu Decoction, augmented with Huangbo and Zhimu.</p>
<p>However, frequent use is ineffective; why is that? It is because the yin is already deficient, causing the fire to flare up. Angelica and Chuanxiong both have warming properties and are not suitable for nourishing yin and descending fire. Moreover, Chuanxiong&#39;s upward movement is particularly inappropriate for those suffering from a deficiency of fire. Rehmannia mud obstructs the diaphragm and is unsuitable for those with stomach heat and excessive phlegm. Huangbo and Zhimu, though described as nourishing yin, actually have a drying effect and harm blood; even though they claim to descend fire, their bitterness first enters the heart, which over time increases qi, thereby potentially supporting fire until it damages the stomach, which goes without saying.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

Additionally, it is critical to avoid Qinko, Lian, and Puhuang, as abrupt use of purely bitter and cold herbs would further weaken yang.

<p>In cases where heavy yin is restored and yang cannot extend, accompanied by chills, discontent, or a rapid wiry pulse with four limbs and five hearts feeling hot, one should use Huoyujing Tang or Chaihu Shengma Tang. The illness should cease promptly; one must not exceed the dosage.</p>
<p>When taking cold and cooling herbs, if symptoms have significantly decreased but the pulse has become more rapid, this indicates the repression of yang, thus it is necessary to help it rise and be replenished.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The treatment should focus on the spleen and kidneys, as the kidneys are the source of vital energy and the spleen nourishes the body. The classics say: &quot;When the body is deficient, it should be warmed by vital energy.&quot; This vital energy refers to the true qi, which has a mild warmth that nourishes the body. However, this warmth should not be allowed to become excessive; if it becomes too hot, it can strengthen the body but ultimately deplete the true qi. The excess warmth is found between the two kidneys. The classics further state: &quot;When essence is deficient, it should be replenished by flavors.&quot; The five flavors enter the stomach, each returning to their preferred organ to generate bodily fluids, which are then transported to the kidneys. If any flavor is taken in excess, it may lead to an excess in the organs, resulting in disharmony. The balance of the five flavors, initially affects the spleen and stomach, and then the organs they correspond to. One should replenish what is lacking and drain what is in excess, carefully maintaining the essence and energy, referring to yin and yang. Thus, when the heavenly pivot is opened, it leads to a harmonious stomach and the generation of veins.</p>
<p>In cases of long-term labor disease causing coughing blood and throat pain without sound, this indicates a transmission from below to above. If there is no cough or pain, but instead turbid urination and loss of essence over time, this indicates a transmission from above to below, both of which are signs of mortality.</p>
<p>The signs of transmitted illness for men begin with the kidneys, affecting the heart, then the lungs, then the liver, and finally the spleen. For women, it starts from the heart, affecting the lungs, then the liver, then the spleen, and then the kidneys. The five organs can also affect the six bowels, leading to death. Although various signs may appear, they ultimately do not stray from the yang of the heart and the yin of the kidneys. If one understands how to use medicine based on the principles of yin and yang, it can bring the dead back to life.</p>

At night, there are involuntary leaks, and there is a weakness with dampness. Once the kidneys are affected, the impact next reaches the heart. When the heart first receives the ailment, there are nighttime fears, or excessive terror; the heart feels anxious, breath shortens and seems close to exhaustion, dreams of the dead arise, sometimes accompanied by night sweats, tastelessness in food, mouth sores, a feeling of heat in the heart, a desire only to sleep, feeling light in the morning and heavy in the evening. The cheeks and lips are all marked red, like wearing rouge, and at times, the hands and feet feel hot and restless. Once the heart is affected, it then transfers to the lungs. When the lungs are first affected, there is coughing and wheezing, worsening at night, dryness in the nose and mouth, not able to smell anything—only detecting a foul odor, sometimes nausea and a desire to vomit, skin becoming dry, occasionally feeling pain, resembling insects crawling, with the skin wrinkled and dry like flaky dough. Once the lungs are affected, it then transmits to the liver. Initially, the liver shows symptoms with the eyes appearing hollow, the face lacking color, often frowning, unable to see far, the eyes always dry, sometimes red and painful, or the whites turning yellow, with a constant desire to close the eyes and difficulty sleeping. Once the liver is affected, it then moves to the spleen. Initially, the spleen shows weakness in the sides, poor digestion of food, sometimes leading to diarrhea, with water and grain producing worms, and sometimes belly pain, swelling, and rumbling in the abdomen, dry and scorched lips, or sores and swelling, hair becoming dry and lackluster, and sometimes feeling short of breath, shoulders feeling heavy and labored; if these symptoms appear, then it is regarded as untreatable.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Formulas</strong></p>
<p>According to the Tianxiong Powder, one formula uses Guizhi Decoction to regulate the nutritive and defensive qi; when the pulse is weak and deficient, add Longgu and Muli to stop the clear fluids, causing loss of blood and essence. With one formula addressing both essential points, it is indeed valuable. The &quot;Xiaopin&quot; also states: for those with deficiency, emaciation, floating heat, and sweating, remove Guizhi and add Bawei and Fuzhu, each three fen, hence it is called the Erjia Longgu Decoction. Understanding this method of addition and subtraction is already a significant step for future practitioners of this formula. </p>
<p>It can be seen that while Guizhi primarily regulates the nutritive and defensive qi, if a person has floating yang deficiency, one should indeed add Fuzhu and Bawei to restore the yang and assist in retaining the clear fluids, making Guizhi no longer necessary. The latter formula, focusing on the yang deficiency in the upper and middle jiao, must use Tianxiong to replenish the upper part, and Baizhu to secure the middle, employing Guizhi to lead the herbs, facilitating the nutritive and defensive qi in the upper jiao while also having the function of restoring yang. Although the lower section does not mention evidence, its treatment method is easy to discern. Therefore, removing Guizhi and adding Bawei and Fuzhu can indeed be seen as a treatment for the yang deficiency in the middle and lower jiao to prevent collapse. This is indeed refined!</p>
<p>It should be noted that with deficiency and labor, to the point of losing blood and essence, consuming essence and fluids, leading to extreme emaciation and exhaustion, it is difficult to find strength.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it is stated that when there is no remedy for acupuncture and medicine, one should adjust with sweet herbs. The &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; follows this principle and uses Xiao Jianzhong Decoction and Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction to urgently bolster the vital energy of Jianzhong, allowing for an increase in food intake and vitality of bodily fluids, ultimately replenishing blood and essence to restore insufficient true yin. One should focus on the sweet essence derived from grain and avoid sour, pungent, salty, and bitter tastes, as there are no other effective methods. Moreover, when applying this method, it is crucial to avoid excess; it is better to induce some bitterness than to use the sweet in Jianzhong. If sweet herbs are consumed and there is a slight sensation of obstruction or stagnation, it is necessary to consider whether the sweetness has been overused, as it can cause fullness. Early use of tangerine peel or cardamom can help to move things along.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Otherwise, one cannot rely on sweet medicines; what else can one rely on? Later generations often use the prescriptions of &quot;Lejing&quot; Jianzhong Decoction and Shisiwei Jianzhong Decoction. Although they do not have the drawbacks of excessive sweetness, in the Lejing formula, Shenghu and Xixin are the chief ingredients, intended to dispel heat; however, the heat from yin deficiency cannot be dispelled. In the Shisiwei formula, using Fuzi, Guizhi, and Congrong aims to restore yang, yet the yang of yin deficiency may not necessarily be restored; it also depends on the skill of the practitioner in adjusting the formula.</p>
<p>The use of Bamei Shenqi Pill in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; has been mentioned repeatedly before. In cases of diabetes where the doors are wide open, and in water conditions where the doors are closed, using this formula stimulates kidney energy, thus the doors can open and close. Just like the morning doors, they open with yang and close with yin, relying on the surrounding areas for stability. For treating foot edema that ascends to the lower abdomen causing numbness, it is used to nourish the true yin and true yang at their root, allowing the turbid yin to gradually disperse without impacting the clear yang. </p>
<p>In current cases of deficiency labor, Guizhi and Fuzi are not utilized, but the symptoms of lower back pain, abdominal tightness, and difficulty in urination all stem from the subtle presence of true yang in the kidneys. These conditions are distinctly different from the symptoms of yin deficiency heat, and one cannot ignore these underlying factors while blaming the absence of treatment.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The disorder of deficiency and fatigue is most susceptible to the invasion of wind and qi. If the wind and qi are not eliminated, external symptoms will increase over time, while internal organs gradually suffer from depletion. This can lead to symptoms that are uncontrollable, with a risk of rapid demise. Therefore, we use the Dioscorea Pill to eliminate the wind and simultaneously nourish the deficiency.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; it states that the yang qi becomes agitated with fatigue. During summer, the essence can become depleted and lead to a state of distress. This has been extensively discussed in the introductory questions and answers. It is evident that deficiency and fatigue stem from the lack of interaction between the heart and kidneys—where kidney water fails to ascend and interact with heart fire, leading to unease and insomnia, not solely in summer.</p>
<p>The prescription of Sour Jujube Seed Decoction is recommended, with the jujube seed as the chief ingredient, complemented by the Restorative Root to nourish the kidneys. Poria and licorice are used to harmonize, while Chuanxiong enters the blood to alleviate the restlessness caused by heart fire.</p>
<p>Regarding the seven injuries, the &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; clearly states these are related to food, worry, diet, sexual relations, starvation, overexertion, and damage to the meridians and defensive qi from sexual overindulgence. However, there are claims suggesting that the seven injuries refer to issues like coldness, impotence, abdominal urgency, reduced essence, dampness below, and difficulty with urination—notions implying kidney injuries.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable that the Five Labors pertain to the five viscera, while the Seven Injuries pertain solely to one organ? Even though individuals may indulge, injuries to the kidneys are persistently common, thus they cannot be ascribed a fixed categorization.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, for those suffering from deficiency syndrome due to internal injuries, there are these seven distinctions. Hence, deficiency fever has never been without stasis of blood. If there is no internal injury, the nourishing and guarding energies flow without obstruction, so where does the stasis originate? It must be due to irregularities in diet and daily activities; when the nourishing and guarding energies stagnate and accumulate, internal injuries occur. Then, the blood gets blocked in the areas of obstruction and becomes stagnant. If this stasis persists for long, it becomes deeply entrenched, and newly produced blood cannot circulate freely, accumulating with each passing day. Can such a person still maintain their life force? Zhang Zhongjing applied a remedy known as &quot;Reviving Human Hand and Eye,&quot; using da huang (rhubarb), insect pills, and lubricants to moisten the dry blood, promoting movement to dispel the stagnant blood. This treatment was named &quot;Soothing the Center and Nourishing Deficiency.&quot; Is it not aimed at moving the blood to remove stasis, thereby calming the interior and replenishing deficiency?

Additionally, using a medicinal ointment like Qiong Yu Gao for nourishment and replenishment is particularly effective. Examining the symptoms closely, one may find the skin and flesh disordered, the complexion darkening, accompanied by emaciation that leads to inability to eat or drink. This condition arises from the accumulation of stagnant blood in the stomach, manifesting on the skin and face, indicating a severe deficiency of the Earth&#39;s nourishment in the Five Organs. This differs from the fundamental illnesses of the Five Yin Organs, hence the prescribed method can be applied, guiding the removal of blood from the stomach to promote the flow of nourishment (Rong) and defense (Wei). Dr. Chen from Xuzhou transmitted the formula of Bai Lao Pill from Zhongjing, stating it treats all forms of consumption and stagnation due to overexertion, appropriate for those whose symptoms do not improve with medicinal intervention. Is it not akin to what is commonly referred to as Dry Blood Consumption? The doctor is perhaps adept at state affairs?

<p>According to &quot;Fu Mai Tang,&quot; Zhongjing treats the pulse disturbance from exogenous cold leading to heart palpitations, a formula of great sanctity. It is not recorded in the &quot;Jin Gui,&quot; yet often used in &quot;Qian Jin Yi&quot; to treat deficiencies due to labor.

<p>In cases of deficiency due to illness, there is frequently an external heat combined with internal yin deficiency, resulting in symptoms of sweating and oppression.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the forbidden prescriptions taught by Master Chang Sang, when each disciple passes it on to one person, it eventually becomes lost upon reaching Hua Yuan, who died in prison, leading to its disappearance. Zhongjing, the saint among doctors, must have grasped the essence of all forbidden prescriptions. Yet, those who have the theory without the practical application are not worthy of respect. Likewise, those with practical results but lacking the underlying theory are also not worthy of respect. Even if there exists both theory and practice, if few wise men have taken heed of it, it is still not worthy of esteem. For instance, while the liver of the otter can eliminate parasites, it cannot promote blood flow to dispel stagnation. Hence, with the aim of nourishing the deficiency, the recipe for Dahuang (rhubarb) pills for reducing parasites was created, originally crafted and handed to Doctor Chen, while the Hundred Labors Pill, incorporating ginseng, is designed for immediate effect. This method, when well applied, could potentially yield substantial results. However, when one is at a loss and resorts to using otter liver to eliminate the parasites, can one really survive merely by removing the parasites? Yet, it is also true that the parasites must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Is there not intention behind the prescriptions found in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; along with those in the &quot;Zhouhou&quot;? According to Dongyuan&#39;s principle regarding diet and exhaustive labor, injury to vital energy causes the yang of the stomach to be unable to rise, leading to the heart and lungs’ energy to fall into the middle jiao. Therefore, it is treated by tonifying the middle and augmenting qi, supplemented with Chaihu (bupleurum) and Shengma (cimicifuga), which rotate in opposite directions around the stomach to elevate the falling energy of the upper jiao; this is not accomplished by merely raising it from the abdomen. If the clear energy sinks into the abdomen for a long time leading to diarrhea, using Sheng and Chai in abundance can effectively elevate from the abdomen.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the yang energy has not necessarily descended and instead ascends to elevate its yin energy, infringing upon the position of yang, how could such a transformation be trivial? Furthermore, if the yin energy is accustomed to obstructing the clear yang above, while the flesh in the chest swells and rises (like the moon), and the qi within the chest disperses causing bloating, applying this method mistakenly could lead to an upheaval, blocking the nine pathways, leaving one on the brink of death and in dire straits. Later generations have passed down that this method can elevate the clear and descend the turbid, and many knowledgeable individuals also believe this; can we still discuss medical matters? To nourish the qi within, allowing it to rise or fall on its own, one need not necessarily use methods to elevate it; using them is also acceptable. But if one demands the ability of elevating the clear from a method meant to descend the turbid, is that not foolish? </p>
<p>According to the evidence of deficiency due to overexertion, those with yin deficiency are often nine out of ten, while those with yang deficiency are only one or two at most.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The introduction discusses the method of補中益氣 (Buzhong Yiqi), which can raise the clear Yang. However, if misapplied, it may instead elevate the turbid Yin, hence the caution that follows. As for Danxi&#39;s method, many who use it find it ineffective—shouldn&#39;t we ponder deeply the reasons for this? Chang asserts that those who establish the law are without fault, while those who apply it may fail to grasp its essence, leading to deviations in their practice.</p>
<p>In essence, there is often an excess of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, yet this point is rarely examined with care. If Yin has a true deficiency at three out of ten while Yang has a true excess at seven out of ten, this is what is meant by true excess and true deficiency. When Yang is truly in excess, any remedies that supplement Yin can be taken freely without fear, and even heavy usage is harmless, thus making the supplementation of Yin necessary.</p>
<p>However, if Yin is genuinely deficient (three out of ten), while Yang appears to be excess (remaining four or five out of ten), it is also referred to as excess, but in reality, it is not a true excess—it ultimately results in the same outcome of deficiency.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Are we still daring to recklessly use medicines that supplement the yin and alleviate coldness? Not understanding this principle and using them indiscriminately will not only be ineffective, but will also lead to a condition of excessive yin and deficient yang, resulting in issues such as spontaneous sweating and weakness of the spleen. Ultimately, the foundation of the yin has already been compromised, and when trying to replenish qi, how can they carry it? Therefore, I reiterate the caution to follow the methods of ancient practitioners, like holding a scale in hand, to weigh and balance their use. Among those suffering from deficiency and excessive yang, is there surely not one or two cases? The formulas from the Yan family, such as Qi Fu Decoction and Ren Fu Decoction, seem indispensable. These formulas are derived from the &quot;Jin Kui&quot; Zhou Fu Decoction, and when used appropriately, they resonate with the spirit. For those with deficiency and loss of blood, the appropriate ones are particularly numerous as they effectively treat the yin fire of Dragon and Thunder. However, with ginseng and astragalus as the monarch and minister, although each dose may be a couple of taels, it is not considered excessive. In the formula, stop using equal parts of astragalus and fuzi; instead, use five qian of ginseng and one tael of fuzi, divided into three doses. Can this not work?<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The Door of Xu Lao (Emaciation)</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Total Compilation of Jingyue</strong> [Ming, Zhang Jiebin]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Origins of Xu Sun Disease</strong></p>
<p>In cases of labor-induced emaciation, each of the five organs has its responsibilities, yet the heart bears the heaviest burden. The heart is the sovereign organ, upon which the vitality of the entire body depends, making it most vulnerable to harm; yet many people overlook this, unaware of its significance. The spirits of the five organs all depend on the heart; thus, when worries arise in the heart, the lungs must respond. If worry persists, leading to deep, somber feelings, the yang energy gradually depletes, and the nutritive and defensive energies diminish day by day. When labor adversely affects the lungs, this situation does not continue indefinitely. As the classic text states: &quot;When one experiences elevated status after a period of devaluation, though not afflicted by an external pathogenic factor, illness arises from within, termed ‘loss of nutritive energy.’ When one experiences wealth after a period of poverty, it is termed ‘loss of essence,’ as the five energies become intertwined, resulting in various afflictions. Sudden joy or sudden sorrow, happiness followed by suffering—all exhaust the vital essence. When the vital essence is depleted, the body deteriorates, leading to significant losses in vitality.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Though not influenced by external evils, if one&#39;s spirit suffers internally, their body will inevitably face defeat and demise. This is simply due to worries about the future and regret over the past, resulting in harm to both the Yang energies, which quietly diminish and flicker in the darkness, unnoticed by people, leading them to be unaware of the damage to the internal organs. The heart is fundamental; in such cases, one should promptly relieve their emotions and accept their fate, striving to restore their innate vitality.</p>
<p>One must understand that in life, happiness for a day equals gaining a day, while sorrow for a day means losing a day. As long as the spirit remains clear and awake, what dust and demons could dare approach? When illness occurs, using remedies like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and various invigorating soups is merely a remedy for the aftermath. The wise should recognize what must be prioritized.</p>
<p>Joy arises from fulfilling desires and seems harmless. Yet, the classics state: joy can damage the heart; it also says that excessive joy harms the Yang; it further states that those who experience joy too freely have scattered spirits that cannot collect; and it says that excessive joy in the lungs leads to harm to the Po spirit, causing madness, wherein one loses their sense of self, leading to a withered appearance, pale complexion, and death in summer. </p>
<p>The heart houses the spirit, and the lungs house the Qi; both are organs of the Yang. Therefore, excessive unrestrained joy harms the Yang, dissipating spirit and energy. If one indulges in joy without moderation, it leads to aimless dispersion, resulting in mental exhaustion that may become irreparable.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sometimes, when one occasionally achieves success, their heart fills with pride, leading to arrogance and self-destruction, often without realizing it. Thus, what should not be overlooked can still be ignored. </p>
<p>The source of thought lies in the heart. The classic text states: when the heart is anxious and troubled, it harms the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear and loss of self follow, leading to physical decline and premature aging, resulting in death in winter. This is how heart injury occurs. Thought arises from the heart, and the spleen must respond; therefore, persistent thinking can injure the spleen. The classic text says: thinking injures the spleen; it also states: when the heart holds onto thoughts, the spirit has a place to return, and the righteous qi remains stagnant, causing obstruction. All of this is illness; when the spleen&#39;s energy is obstructed, it leads to choking, vomiting, and an inability to digest food. When food cannot be digested, blood and energy are depleted daily, muscles deteriorate, and mental vitality diminishes, causing limbs to swell and leading to diarrhea, among other symptoms. This is the injury to the yang of the heart and spleen. Who among people is without thoughts? Yet, when overthinking causes pain, it leads to such injuries—this is something those who practice health preservation should be aware of. Furthermore, while thought primarily injures the spleen, worry also harms the spleen.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: If the spleen is troubled and cannot resolve its worries, it injures the mind; when the mind is injured, the thoughts become disordered, the limbs become weak, and the complexion pales, leading to death in spring. People’s worries and thoughts are generally numerous and mixed, and thus the heart, spleen, and lungs are all damaged, resulting in harm to the yang qi of the upper burner. The diseases of the two yang originate from the heart and spleen, progressively manifesting as symptoms of deficiency, presented here.</p>
<p>Lustful desires and evil thoughts differ from worries and thoughts, yet they harm only the kidneys. The heart, when tempted by desires, must respond with the kidneys. When the sovereign fire moves upward, the ministerial fire responds below. This ministerial fire is the fire within water; when still and guarded, it constitutes yang qi, but when fervent and uncontrolled, it becomes like dragon thunder, scorching all. Thus, when it is in the kidneys, it results in residual heat and turbidity; as the water and liquids gradually dry up and the fire rises into the liver, it forces the blood into chaotic movement, causing vomiting or nosebleeds, or leading to deficiencies that result in pain in the sinews and bones. If it further ascends to the spleen, it injures the spleen&#39;s yin, resulting in fevers and the total transformation of food into phlegm. If it ascends to the lungs, the skin and hair lose their ability to be firm, leading to a loss of yang, causing wheezing and cough, and even leading to mute and hoarse voices.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>These are all rootless, empty fires; the yang does not guard the home, and its flames reach to the heavens, rising from below, from the kidneys to the lungs. The source gradually withers, with the upper part solid and the lower part empty, truly a manifestation of extreme depletion. Among those who are unaccompanied, such as monks and female practitioners, even though they are not entangled in marital duties, their private feelings are bound in love, and their thoughts are endless. When separated by thousands of miles and their wishes unfulfilled, the fiery desire shakes their hearts, the true yin decreases daily, leading to irreparable emptiness and loss. Among the five labors, none is worse than this. If one knows to value life, they must carefully avoid it!</p>
<p>The seven feelings harm the kidneys, and fear is likely among them. Fear and dread reside in the heart, hence the kidneys are affected. Therefore, the scriptures say: fear harms the kidneys; it also says: fear causes the essence to retreat; and again it mentions: fear and anxiety without resolution harm the essence. When the essence is harmed, the bones ache, and there is weakness and numbness in the limbs. I once diagnosed a young official whose illness stemmed from fear; although his condition slightly improved, he became impotent, and when his illness recurred, it was ultimately incurable. I have also witnessed those who experience sudden fear; they invariably suffer from retraction of the yin or involuntary urination, all indications of kidney injury.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, excessive anger indeed harms the kidneys, and anger itself also damages the kidneys.

When the will is injured, joy forgets its previous words, the lower back cannot bend or extend, hair withers, complexion fades, and death occurs in late summer.&quot; Thus, it is understood that severe anger not only harms the liver, but also the kidneys suffer damage.</p>
<p>Anger arises from the heart, and the liver must respond. If anger is unrestrained, it causes labor and harm to the liver. The classic text states: &quot;Anger injures the liver&quot;; it also states: &quot;Anger causes the qi to rebel, and in severe cases, leads to vomiting blood and diarrhea, which causes the qi to rise.&quot; This is because the liver is a yang organ within the yin, so liver diseases can manifest in both yin and yang aspects. For instance, if anger causes fire to surge, it forces the blood to move erratically, resulting in qi rebellion, leading to distention, pain, and shortness of breath; this injures its yin. Alternatively, if anger injures the qi, the wood element becomes stagnant and cannot extend, which adversely affects the spleen&#39;s qi, resulting in bloating, pain, and food and drink not moving well; this injures its yang. However, the occasional expression of anger does not necessarily lead to illness, and firm internal organs do not always result in disease.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Only those who are weak in their innate constitution and easily harmed by the three yin should avoid excess without knowledge of moderation; otherwise, the abundance from the East will often lead to ruin in the West. Anger primarily injures the liver, while grief also most severely hurts the liver. The classics say: when grief moves the liver, it damages the soul; when the soul is harmed, one becomes manic and unfocused; when unfocused, one becomes imprecise. This leads to a retraction of the yin and rigidity of the tendons, the sides of the body are unsupported, the hair wanes, the complexion fades, leading to death in autumn. Indeed, excessive anger injures the liver, indicating abundant liver qi; grief injures the liver, indicating deficient liver qi. However, abundance does not last forever, whereas deficiency can lead to lasting emptiness. If deficiency is neglected, it will inevitably cause exhaustion, and treatment must focus on discerning the right from the wrong.</p>
<p>The shock energy originally enters the heart but indeed connects with the liver and gallbladder. The classics say: when startled, the heart has nothing to rely on, the spirit has nowhere to return, and thoughts are not settled, thus the qi becomes chaotic. Furthermore, it is said: the color associated with the East is green, which connects with the liver, and ailments arise from shock. This is why shock can disturb the heart, but especially injure the liver and gallbladder.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart, as the ruler, must not be harmed; however, the gallbladder, serving as the official of middle righteousness, truly houses the vital energy of Shaoyang. Therefore, the yang essence of the eleven organs depends on the gallbladder. If it is harmed, the vital energies of the organs will dwindle, leading to inevitable defeat and danger. I have observed those who fall ill from slight fright; by nurturing the heart and calming the spirit, when the spirit is restored, the illness will dissipate. If fear accumulates over time or if a sudden fright harms the gallbladder, it can cause bile to seep, resulting in a yellowing of the entire body, leaving one silently suffering—such cases are beyond remedy, as elaborated in the discourse on jaundice.</p>
<p>Excessive desire for color and form often leads to depletion. Since from birth, one relies solely on the postnatal essence and energy as the foundation of life. Thus, strong essence leads to a strong spirit; a strong spirit must have longevity. Conversely, weak essence and energy result in weakness, often leading to premature death. Those who are naturally endowed but have a thin base must recognize and cultivate their postnatal essence; in doing so, longevity can be achieved. However, if one’s endowment is already weak, and yet one indulges in desires and exhausts postnatal energy, it will surely lead to depletion. In such cases, who shall be blamed for the loss of life? </p>
<p>Moreover, there are young ones who have not yet matured; at the time when Ren water is just beginning, nurturing their budding vitality is crucial. If ignorant youths quickly indulge in sexual desires, I have witnessed many like unfurling buds, like mayflies flickering from dawn to dusk—this is truly lamentable. The blame does not fall upon the youth but on their parents and teachers.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

Who can escape labor in this world? Like those who toil daily for their livelihood, tirelessly pursuing their work yet unaware of their ailments—how is this so? The labor of poverty and hardship, if done with moderation and detached from fame and disgrace, becomes a habit that poses no illness. It is only the idle and delicate who, in overexerting themselves, suffer harm. Thus, some labor for fame and wealth, unaware of the toll of seasons on their health; some labor for lust, oblivious to the fatigue of day and night; some labor in idleness, enduring hunger and exhaustively rushing to and fro; some labor under illness, suffering further harm at the hands of incompetent and fraudulent doctors; some are ensnared by poetry and learning, each misfortune growing from their obsession; and some, driven by a reckless bravado, ultimately become exhausted and drained of strength.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

<p>A young person who frequently drinks wine tends to suffer from labor and damage. Wine is fundamentally an intoxicating substance that greatly harms the true essence. Drinking a little may not necessarily be harmful, but excessive drinking inevitably leads to injury, and those who indulge excessively suffer the consequences in almost all cases. Furthermore, every person&#39;s constitution has yin and yang, and the nature of wine also possesses yin and yang. Wine is made through fermentation, which gives it a hot nature; when it is diluted with water, it has a cold quality.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If those with Yin deficiency indulge excessively in drinking, their constitution is insufficient to nourish Yin, leading to a tendency to generate heat. Thus, the heat intensifies, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting blood, bloody nosebleeds, blood in stools, blood in urine, wheezing, irritability, mania, and agitation. This is because alcohol harms Yin. Conversely, if those with Yang deficiency indulge, their constitution is unable to support Yang, causing fluids to accumulate as dampness. Therefore, the cold increases, leading to symptoms such as swelling, diarrhea, abdominal pain, acid reflux, poor appetite, loss of Yang, and sudden collapse. This occurs because alcohol injures Yang. Thus, excessive drinking can harm both Yin and Yang, with such dangers present—are people aware of this? Moreover, alcohol can disrupt one&#39;s nature; it often leads to reckless behavior, resulting in damage to essence and depletion of energy, causing distress and loss of balance—encountering illness can be overwhelming. The damage to Yin goes often unnoticed. During times of excessive drinking, one does not consider the harm that can arise. When illness strikes severely, one may still be unaware that it is due to the effects of alcohol.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Diseases can be classified as deficiency or excess, and treatments should either tonify or drain. Only when supplementation and draining are properly administered can one be considered a master in the field. I have observed that many practitioners do not understand the principles of healing, and they are neither aware of what is right or wrong nor understand the urgency of conditions. As a result, they often harm the vital energy of patients and disrupt their life force; those who suffer and die from the treatment have no recourse. Those who are fortunate enough to escape still suffer from the detrimental effects, leading to many cases of deficiency that cannot recover. Why is this the case? Thus, it is crucial that medical professionals approach their craft with care and avoid rashness, as this is genuinely a part of accumulating virtue for compassionate individuals. </p>
<p>Moreover, if there are failures in regulation and treatment leading to inability to recover, the saying goes: &quot;If the small hole is not patched, the large hole will lament suffering.&quot; This results from one&#39;s own actions, so what more is there to criticize? </p>
<p>The causes of deficiency are as previously discussed and stem solely from indulgence in alcohol, pleasures, labor, emotional strains, and dietary excesses. Thus, one might first injure the vital energy, which will subsequently affect the essence; or one might first injure the essence, which will then affect the vital energy. Both vital energy and essence within a person are referred to as the yin aspect. Yin is the root of all that is heavenly, the progenitor of form and substance. Therefore, any loss related to form and substance is collectively termed as yin deficiency—this is a fundamental observation.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

In all cases of exhaustion and related symptoms, if the root is not damaged, how could there be such severe consequences? Therefore, in all illnesses more pronounced at the upper part, the depletion must be more severe at the lower part. Hence, I say: when the emptiness of malicious influences arrives, the harm must return to yin; the injuries of the five organs ultimately affect the kidney. When it reaches this point, what more can I do? What is valued is that the noble man recognizes the subtle signs. </p>
<p>All damages to the original qi are fundamentally empty conditions. Ancient methods distinguished these empty damages—whether from exhaustion or consumption—into various categories; even if the diseases seem different, they should still be discerned. The term &quot;empty damage&quot; implies that it may manifest as one symptom or may result in fatigue for a time; as long as it pertains to the meridians or organs and harms the original qi, it is fundamentally an empty damage condition. As for the differing symptoms of exhaustion and disease, some may present with bone steaming, some with dry coughing, and even with coughing up blood or phlegm, leading to failure in both nutritive and protective qi, resulting in continual decline. This accumulation occurs gradually; when both the root and the branches are exhausted, it is a consequence.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the illness is not deep yet, it is advisable to use warming tonics. However, in cases of exhaustion and consumptive disorders, where the deficiency is deep in the yin region, there are many conditions where warming tonics should be avoided. In general, for treating deficiency syndromes, conditions that are appropriate for warming tonics tend to be easier to treat; those that are not suitable for warming tonics are often harder to treat. This deficiency and exhaustion may seem different, but it is important to recognize that the damage from consumptive illnesses is deeply rooted and leads to considerable deficiency.</p>
<p>If the signs of deficiency remain, they will gradually worsen into exhaustion, and one must be cautious about this. If there are two prominent red cheeks or red lips, it indicates a deficiency in the lower part, forcing the yang upward. As Zhang Zhongjing stated, the face displaying yang is due to deficiency below. If there is much thirst, it signifies insufficient kidney water, as the body seeks to replenish itself. Hoarseness or the inability to speak arises from depleted kidney energy, since sound emerges from the throat but is fundamentally rooted in the kidneys. The classics say: when one loses internal vitality, they become mute. This indicates kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>If there is deficiency accompanied by urgent breathing, it is due to yin-deficient lungs, where the qi has nowhere to settle. Dry throat and sore throat indicate a deficiency in true water below and an excess of floating fire above. If one cannot sleep and feels disoriented, it shows that blood does not nurture the heart, causing the spirit to be uncontained.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Excessive anger arises from a deficiency in water and a dryness in wood, leading the liver to lose its nourishment. A lack of appetite and gradual muscle wasting indicate that the spleen&#39;s essence is lost and the transformative mechanism is failing. A racing heart and restlessness signify that the qi is not returning to its essence. It is said: the great network of the stomach is called the &quot;virtual interior,&quot; originating below the left breast, responding to clothing and indicating a leakage of vital qi. Continuous night sweats occur when there is fire, preventing the yin from holding, and without fire, the yang cannot be stabilized. When there is a deficiency accompanied by phlegm, whether it resembles clear water or has much white foam, it is due to water overflowing as phlegm, and the spleen is too weak to control water. Bone pain that feels like fractures indicates the kidney governs bones, and true yin is depleting. Pain in the waist and flanks suggests deficiency in both the liver and kidney. Coldness below the knees signifies the gate of life is failing, causing fire not to return to its source.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Nails</strong></p>
<p>All Diseases of Strain and Injury Originally Belong to Yin Deficiency. Yin Deficiency Must Invariably Lead to Blood Deficiency, and Fingernails Are the Residue of Essence and Blood. Thus, when diagnosing, if one observes the nails to be dry and yellow, feeling a withered appearance, then the vital essence and nourishment of hair and skin are visibly apparent. This indicates the presence of deficiency symptoms beyond just pulse and color, and the severity of the deficiency can also be discerned from it.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The deficiency and damage of diseases exhibit different transformations, with variations occurring from the Five Strains and Seven Injuries, manifesting in the functions of the nutritive and defensive qi as well as the organs. In summary, what sustains life is solely this essence and qi; and in diseases characterized as deficient and damaged, it is also solely this essence and qi. Deficiency of qi reflects Yang Deficiency; deficiency of essence reflects Yin Deficiency. In cases where there is excessive fire and insufficient water, and one observes the nutritive and defensive qi to be dry, with body fluids depleted, this denotes symptoms of Yin Deficiency. Conversely, in cases of excessive water and insufficient fire, with the organs being cold and the spleen and kidneys failing, this indicates symptoms of Yang Deficiency. This is merely due to the imbalance of Yin and Yang. </p>
<p>When treating these conditions, one should only nourish the deficient aspect and not deplete the excess. If one were to further deplete what is in excess due to existing deficiency, it would result in mutual harm. Would this not be perilous? The differentiation of Yin and Yang is not readily clear. Within Yin and Yang, there exist further distinctions; some may seem Yang but are not, some may appear Yin but are not. Without true discernment, it is easy to fall into confusion, thus this should be carefully examined. Furthermore, there are instances of both Yin and Yang being deficient; in such cases, Yang is the foundation of life, and what is emphasized should primarily be the Yang qi.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this context, the treatment of deficiency is like pointing out with fingers. Those with yang deficiency often feel cold, not due to external cold but because the yang energy is insufficient, leading to internal coldness. If one waits until it is already cold, then the yang has already weakened. If one perceives a weakness in the illness without any signs of heat, it is indeed a sign of yang deficiency. One should then warm and tonify the original energy, allowing the yang energy to gradually return, thus restoring the true essence. </p>
<p>The condition of yang deficiency is often caused by worries, excessive thinking that harms the spirit, or irregular labor that exhausts strength, or excessive desire that depletes the essence, or a natural lack of original yang leading to cold-related ailments—these are all reasons for the damage to yang energy. To replenish yang energy, only warm, sweet, and dry herbs are suitable; never combine them with cool, cold, or slippery substances, as those would deplete the emerging energy. Herbs like rehmannia, peony, ophiopogon, and sand ginseng are to be avoided, while those such as dendrobium, scrophularia, and others like phellodendron, coptis, and turtle gelatin must also be strictly omitted. If both qi and blood are deficient, a strong formula like the Great Replenishing Decoction, Eight Treasures Decoction, or Ten Complete Replenishing Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For example, ginseng, astragalus, wolfberry, angelica, and eucommia are all substances that contain both yin and yang, and they should be used appropriately. This is because an excess of yang may further deplete yin, and an increase in heat can dry up water. Those with yin deficiency suffer from a lack of water, and those who are low in water should avoid cold and cool substances, as these are harmful and not nourishing. If there is excessive fire and one must resort to cooling agents, it is also necessary to combine them with tonics for the water element, using them in conjunction as needed, and stopping when appropriate to prevent deterioration. This is the great principle of nourishment.</p>
<p>For conditions of deficiency and night heat, or heat occurring in the afternoon, or when one prefers cold yet feels solid, these all indicate heat arising from yin deficiency, where water fails to control fire, and it is advisable to adjust the formula with a yin tonic. If the fire affects the heart and kidney, leading to palpitations and lack of focus, a stronger yin tonic is recommended. If there is persistent external heat with mild internal heat, one should merely tonify yin and not clear the fire, opting for a basic yin decoction, or Six-ingredient Rehmannia Decoction. If there is insufficient vital energy accompanied by persistent heat, a major decoction to restore the original qi must be used to promote self-healing over time.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs are considered the organ of metal, and what metal fears is fire, while its destructive influence comes from dryness. When dryness occurs, itching inevitably follows, and with itching comes coughing. This is exactly because the water from the kidneys cannot control the fire, thus affecting the metal; the yin essence cannot transform into qi, leading to dryness and causing symptoms like cough, wheezing, sore throat, voice hoarseness, and other related conditions. </p>
<p>When treating these symptoms, one should use only soothing, cool, and tranquilizing remedies to nourish the metal and water, ensuring that the lungs and kidneys support each other, without being overpowered by fire, which allows the true yin to gradually recover and the cough to improve. If fire is vigorous, one should use a modified Four Yin Decoction. If fire is mild, then a One Yin Decoction or the Liu Wei Di Huang Decoction, or the Left Returning Decoction may be appropriate. For those who have contracted wind and cold along with cough, the Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction is recommended. The Bei Mu Pill is the best for treating cough. </p>
<p>For those with deficiency leading to hemoptysis, this injures their yin, which can cause either vomiting or nasal bleeding.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In urgent situations, one must address the symptoms rather than the root cause, and thus, it is necessary to temporarily use herbs like Qín, Lián, Zhī, Yè, bamboo leaves, and童便 (child&#39;s urine). Alternatively, one may use formulas such as Chōuxīn drink or Xǐnxīn drink. If there is a deficiency of Yin accompanied by slight Fire, the appropriate remedy is to prepare Bǎo Yīn decoction, or Qīng Huà drink, or modify Yīnyīn decoction to treat the condition. Once the bleeding has stopped, it is essential to nourish the blood without excessively using cold or cool substances. If there is no excess Fire but the Yin is completely damaged, leading to a deficiency of Yin and a loss of water, causing vomiting or nosebleeds, one should use sweet and pure nourishing Yin products to quiet the movement and harmonize the damage. This allows the Yin energy to rest and be nourished, which will help the blood return to normal channels. Formulas such as Yīnyīn decoction, Liù Wèi Dì Huáng Tang, or Xiǎo Yíng decoction would be appropriate. If there is a Yin deficiency affecting the lungs, accompanied by coughing and bleeding, one should use Sì Yīnyīn decoction with adjustments. If bleeding occurs due to overexertion without any Fire symptoms, and all three Yin -- heart, spleen, and kidney -- are harmed and causing bleeding, one should use Wǔ Yīnyīn decoction, Wǔ Fú drink, or Liù Wèi Dì Huáng pill. If there is a Yin deficiency below and the Yang is constrained above, with all six pulse positions weak and leading to severe vomiting and nosebleeds, this indicates that Fire is not returning to its source, and True Yang has lost control. One should use Yòu Guī drink with modifications or Bā Wèi Dì Huáng Tang as suitable alternatives.

These are the distinctions that can be made. However, qi governs the lungs and transforms through essence, the spirit governs the heart and transforms through qi, muscle comes under the spleen and the earth is born from fire, all blood is stored in the liver and blood transforms in the spleen and stomach, essence and marrow govern the kidneys and receive from the five organs, which are inseparable. When the state becomes severe, the root and branch are transmitted and affect the organs and viscera, thus this aspect cannot be strictly defined. Therefore, in all methods of replenishing deficiency, one must clarify the principles of yin and yang, their ascents and descents, and the nature of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness; with essence being within qi and qi being within essence. Furthermore, in cases of insufficient yang qi in the upper jiao, it must descend into the kidneys; thus, it ought to be sought below the most yin; and when there is insufficient true yin in the lower jiao, it often rises above—should we not guide it back to its source? Therefore, the treatment must seek the root to achieve the utmost goodness. However, my other methods of supplementation are all found within the new formulas of the eight guidelines and eight arrays; with careful observation, one can grasp their essence.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Between Apparent Damage and Non-Damage</strong></p>
<p>In cases where there appear to be damages but are not, this phenomenon is only present when the body has been subjected to external cold pathogens. Initially, when these external pathogens invade, they do not disperse and are mistakenly treated as internal injuries; treatments may involve cooling or drainage methods, which can lead to the cold pathogens becoming trapped and lingering, resulting in alternating chills and fever or phlegmy cough. The symptoms may seem identical to those of exhaustion. If one treats this condition with methods aimed at injuries, such as nourishing yin, this can actually exacerbate the retention of the pathogens, leading to prolonged heat effects, ultimately transforming what is not an injury into an actual injury. I have treated several patients with this condition. To distinguish such cases, one must carefully analyze both the exterior and the interior and investigate the causes of the illness. Symptoms indicative of exhaustion always stem from some cause, whereas external pathogen invasion occurs suddenly. If there is bodily pain accompanied by slight sweating, resulting in diminished fever, yet fever returns without sweating, or if there is a loud cough with a pulse that feels taut but not overly rapid, or a mix of harmonious and relaxed symptoms, then even if the illness lasts for a month or two without resolution of the pathogens, this is not a case of labor injury—do not misdiagnose. For those with persistent alternating fever and chills, it is advisable to use the Chai Hu Decoction (or variants thereof). If cough accompanies it, then add Chai Chen Decoction. For those with spleen and kidney qi deficiency accompanied by cough, use Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction. If the pathogens are still unresolved and accompanied by chills and fevers, continue adding Chai Hu.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Deficiency and Its Dire Consequences</strong></p>
<p>When deficiency has already taken hold, how can one remedy it? If one cannot tolerate ginseng, cooked rhizoma rehmanniae, and various tonifying medicines, this indicates an inability to receive nourishment due to deficiency—how can one hope for recovery? If, after exhausting labor, one experiences vomiting of blood or significant blood loss, and suffers from coughing that cannot be stopped along with excessive phlegm, this is due to extreme deficiency of the spleen and lungs, rendering food unable to transform into blood, thus phlegm is formed from food consumed. Although this is not blood, it is similar in nature. The classics say: &quot;If white blood emerges, death follows.&quot; Hence, the phlegm that is the most abundant and turbid cannot be treated. </p>
<p>On either side of the body is the pathway of yin and yang. For those who cannot turn or change their position easily during sleep, it indicates an imbalance in yin and yang energies, leaving them deplete—this too is often untreatable. In cases of deficiency illness, there is generally no external pathogen, so although the disease may be exhausting, it does not cause chaos. If one has a deficiency syndrome, without any other pathogenic heat, and experiences delirium and disarray, this indicates heart failure and the departure of spirit—it is certainly fatal. </p>
<p>If labor causes coughing, loss of voice, or acute wheezing and shortness of breath, this signifies lung failure—it is certainly fatal. In cases of extreme labor where all muscle is exhausted, this indicates spleen failure—it is certainly fatal. </p>
<p>Tendons are the root of fatigue; in any case of deficiency and chronic illness, there are often pains in the muscles and bones. If the pain becomes unbearably severe, this indicates depletion of blood unable to nourish the tendons—this is liver failure—it is certainly fatal. </p>
<p>When exhaustion has persisted for a long time, and one suffers from uncontrollable diarrhea, this indicates kidney failure—it is certainly fatal.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Discussion on the Difficult Classic of Damage and Evidence</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Difficult Classic,&quot; the concepts of upper damage and lower damage are extremely profound, yet there are aspects that remain incomplete and should be thoroughly understood. Generally speaking, external factors such as overthinking and fatigue damage Yang; when Yang is harmed, the illness necessarily arises from above and descends. Conversely, internal damage caused by desires, drunkenness, and overindulgence harms Yin; when Yin is harmed, the illness inevitably rises from below and ascends. As the classic states: &quot;Illnesses of the two Yangs affect the heart and spleen, resulting in issues such as failure to hide one&#39;s true condition, and similar cases in women when their monthly cycle is disrupted,&quot; which exemplifies the descent from above. Furthermore, the classic mentions: &quot;The five viscera govern the storage of essence; thus, they must not be harmed. If they are harmed, they lose their protective function resulting in Yin deficiency. With Yin deficiency, there is no vital energy, and without vital energy, death follows.&quot; This illustrates the ascent from below. In essence, conditions arising from above tend to first deplete the vital energy.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, if damage occurs to the lungs, the illness manifests in voice and skin; if damage occurs to the heart, the illness is reflected in blood vessels and complexion; if damage occurs to the stomach, the illness results in improper intake of food; if damage occurs to the liver, the illness leads to pain and convulsions; if damage occurs to the kidneys, the illness results in bone weakness and inability to control urination. This initially injures the yang and subsequently affects the yin; when the yang is exhausted below, there can be no solitary existence of the yin, which is not feasible. </p>
<p>From below to above, the injury first affects the essence. Thus, if damage occurs to the kidneys, the illness manifests as a dried-up source; if damage occurs to the liver, the illness leads to blood movement and muscle depletion; if damage occurs to the spleen, the illness results in excessive phlegm and dampness; if damage occurs to the heart, the illness leads to loss of spirit and soul; if damage occurs to the lungs, the illness manifests as wheezing and shortness of breath. This first injures the yin and subsequently affects the yang; when the yin is exhausted above, there can be no solitary existence of the yang, which is not feasible.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said: when the heart and lungs are damaged, the spirit weakens; when the liver and kidneys are deficient, the body deteriorates; when the spleen and stomach are damaged, food and drink do not nourish the vital energy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Cui Pingshi&#39;s method treats the five labors and seven injuries. </p>
<p>For the formula: one part of Zhongru powder, one part of Bixie, two parts of Bajitian, two parts of Tusizi, two parts of Congrong, and three parts of dried ginger. (Some texts say dried Rehmannia instead of dried ginger.) Grind these six ingredients into a fine powder, mix with honey to form pills the size of a walnut. Take seven pills with wine, three times a day. After taking, walk a hundred steps; after taking the wine three times, walk three hundred steps. If the heat in the chest is settled, then eat plain rice, and meat from cows, sheep, or rabbits is permissible, avoiding fatty or greasy foods; otherwise, there are no restrictions.</p>
<p>For the Shiying decoction: it treats the five labors and seven injuries in both men and women, dissipates withering and emaciation, addresses wind deficiency, coldness, lack of strength, pale complexion, inability to act, bitter mouth and dry throat, restlessness during sleep, nightmares, fright, and numerous ailments. </p>
<p>Crush white quartz into rice-sized pieces, use nine sheng of pure wine, simmer in a copper vessel over low heat to extract three sheng. While stirring continuously with a bamboo spatula, remove the residue and clarify. The method for purple quartz is the same as above. </p>
<p>For the following ingredients, each uses one jin of dried Rehmannia, three jin of white honey, five liang of Dendrobium, three sheng each of peach kernel and cedar nuts, as well as yuan zhi, poria, shan zhu yu, ginseng, mai men dong, cinnamon heart, five-flavor fruit, dried ginger, bai zhu, cong rong, licorice, tian xiong, bai zhi, xi xin, xuang ru, huang qi, fang feng, and shan yao—two liang of each. </p>
<p>Mix these twenty-four ingredients, filter them, and if insufficient, add wine to a sufficient level; simmer until they can be rolled into pills the size of walnuts. Take twenty pills with wine, three times a day, gradually increasing to forty pills as the standard. If there are no ingredients, one may take the decoction alone, which helps in becoming plump, fair, and robust.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a></p></div>

<p>A heavenly spirit cap is required; for men, use only if the color is not red; for women, do not use if the color is red. Prepare it by simmering it in sandalwood water until cool, then wash it. The incantation goes: &quot;Lightning Lord spirit, Thunder Lord sacred, wherever a corpse is encountered, you must respond. Urgent as dictated by law!&quot; Recite the incantation seven times, then use the following ingredients: five qian each of fried yellow peach kernels without skin, anise, betel nut, one piece of fresh turtle shell, two pieces of dried tiger incisors, fresh rhinoceros horn, wood fragrance, descending true fragrance, sweet-sorrel, and fried dry lacquer, each three qian; two qian of thunder pills; the toe of a pangolin, fried; three whole scorpions; ten earthworms, ground fresh and mixed with the medicine. </p>
<p>This mix is to be administered in five qian doses. First, use forty grains of fermented soybean heart, position two seven-inch stems of peach, plum, mulberry, and cherry facing east, with seven blue-green leaves growing, a small handful of Qinghao, and five white green onions washed with roots, all ground together in a stone mortar with a bowl and a half of well water to boil down to one cup, add one cup of child&#39;s urine, mix in the powdered medicine, boil down to seven parts, then add a word of musk. </p>
<p>On the first month’s early morning, take warm as directed and cover oneself to induce sweating. To be wary of tiny worms in the sweat, wipe it with soft cloth and then burn the cloth. After a while, expect a purge; use a clean bucket to catch the worms quickly, burn them in fierce fire, and collect them in a cinnabar bottle sealed with a yellow cover. Secure the bottle with iron wire and bury it deep in the mountains far from human paths.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a></p></div>

<p>The autumn dew atop the hundred herbs is collected on the first day of the eighth month. Grind it and apply it to the acupoint at the heart to treat consumption, called &quot;Heavenly Moxibustion.&quot; </p>
<p>For bone steaming and fever: one tael of realgar, mixed in one liter of urine, ground to powder. Then take a piece of Huanglishi about one foot in square shape, burn it over charcoal for a while, and pour the concentrated liquid over the stone. Place a thin mat on top, have the patient sit naked on it, surrounded by clothing to retain heat, and after three to five treatments, they will recover. </p>
<p>For lung consumption and cough: one tael of orpiment placed in a clay box not tightly closed, situated on the ground and surrounded by dirt, about two inches thick. Use one pound of charcoal, tightly packed atop, burn it until one-third is removed. After cooling, it should be ground into powder; mix with sugar and form pills the size of millet. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with apricot seed decoction. </p>
<p>Bone steaming disease, with external cold and internal heat, manifests as steaming attached to the bones. Its root lies within the five viscera and six bowels and must come after suffering. As bones and flesh gradually waste away, food loses flavor, and the skin becomes dry and lackluster. In times of intense steaming, the limbs gradually thin, and the feet may swell. Grind ten taels of gypsum into powder as fine as milk, mix with water, and take with a small spoon twice daily, while keeping the body cool.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li&#39;s method for preparing milk:</p>
<p>This is for treating five labors and seven injuries, coughs, and upward qi. It is effective for treating cold coughs, clarifying the voice, brightening the eyes and enriching essence, calming the five organs, opening the hundred joints, benefiting the nine orifices, promoting lactation, replenishing energy, and healing weaknesses like coldness and pain in the feet. It supports the lower jiao and strengthens the yin. Prolonged use prolongs life, prevents aging, and enhances fertility.</p>
<p>Obtain milk from the Zhao Prefecture, regardless of its thickness, but select only those that are bright, clear, and glossy; avoid yellow and red varieties. Place the milk in a metal vessel; in a large pot with water, boil it until it bubbles like fish eyes, adding water as it decreases. Cook with less milk for three days and nights, and with more for seven days and nights. Wait until it dries and the color changes to yellow-white, and if unsure, cook longer. The best is after ten days. </p>
<p>Remove from water, and boil again in clean water for half a day; stop when the water remains clear and unchanged, indicating the milk is non-toxic. Transfer to a porcelain bowl, and grind with a jade pestle in water, adding water if it feels dry, keeping it in a thin rice gruel-like consistency. Grind for four to five days until it is smooth and shiny like white fish in text, then wash with water; the parts that don’t fall are ready, while those that do need further grinding. After that, dry it completely. Use one and a half qian, mix with warm wine, and take on an empty stomach, also suitable for blending into pills or powders.</p>
<p>Avoid taking the milk if the water is yellow and murky; consumption can harm the throat and injure the lungs, leading to headaches or persistent diarrhea. If one succumbs, eating pork can counteract the effects. 【From &quot;Qianjinfang&quot;】<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a></p></div>

<p>For men and women with deficiencies leading to unrest, anxiety, dryness and thirst, yellow pallor of the face, inability to eat or drink, or experience thirst before developing sores, or develop boils before feeling thirst, it is advisable to take this medicine regularly to tonify qi and blood, stabilize and harmonize the internal organs, ensuring lifelong immunity from boils and sores.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Evaporation Heat of Bone:</strong> A three-year-old child’s urine amounts to five liters; boil it down to one liter and mix it with three teaspoons of honey. Take two bowls at a time and repeat after half a day. After this, regularly take your own urine. Light cases recover in twenty days, and severe cases in fifty days. After twenty days, one should expect to see worms like centipedes emerge from the body. If someone nearby can smell the foul odor of the patient’s urine, it indicates recovery. Zhang, a Taoist from the Danxian Temple in Taizhou, cured himself of this illness using this method, which proved effective. </p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Timidity in Men and Women:</strong> Men should use the urine of young girls, and women should use the urine of young boys. Collect the urine, removing the head and tail. Take this twice daily, pressing it between hot cakes, and complete recovery will occur in a month.</p>
<p><strong>Deficiency and Consumption:</strong> Use &quot;De Sheng Dan.&quot; Take three cups of breast milk from a healthy woman. Heat a ceramic plate until very hot and place the milk in it, then add a little musk powder and two fen (a measure) of sandalwood powder. Mix well and consume this, followed by three cups of strong tea. Afterward, repeat the process with the breast milk and add a proper quantity of powdered human placenta. After consumption, the face and knees will turn red, similar to being drunken and sleepy, and one should nourish oneself with a little plain congee.</p>
<p><strong>Life-Connecting Elixir:</strong> This treats men and women with weak qi and blood, and symptoms of phlegm-fire rising due to deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Method of Locating Acupoints: The individual should sit upright with a curved spine, extending both arms, resting the elbows on the knees to maintain an upright posture. The thumbs should align with the knees. Using an object to support the elbows allows the arms to move. Starting from the upper corner of the shoulder blade, feel down to the bottom of the shoulder blade; in between, there should be four ribs with three gaps—apply moxibustion in the middle. Inside the shoulder blade, where the ribs are empty, about a finger’s breadth away from the shoulder blade, rub the surface of the bones and flesh in the empty spaces between the ribs. Pressing here should create a sensation of pulling within the chest. Apply moxibustion at each point between the shoulder blades, either up to six hundred or as much as one thousand times. One should feel energy flowing downward in a continuous manner akin to running water, and there should be some discharge. If there’s no accumulation of phlegm or chronic disease, there will be nothing to discharge. If the patient is too exhausted to sit upright, they should lie on their side, with the upper arm drawn forward, to locate and apply moxibustion at the acupoints. To locate the acupoints, use the right hand to measure from the right shoulder to the extent just beyond where the fingers can reach. The left hand will do the same. Then apply moxibustion as previously mentioned. If unable to sit upright for a long time, they can extend both arms while lying down on a cloth. Ensure the two shoulder blades are pulled apart; otherwise, the shoulder blades will cover the acupoints, making them inaccessible. The cloth used should be a consistent size; otherwise, the points will be lost. After finishing the moxibustion, the individual should feel an increase in yang energy. It’s important to take care of oneself to restore the body&#39;s balance. The acupoint is near the fifth vertebra, so align accordingly to locate it.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a></p></div>

In Piling County, there are stone carvings that are most detailed; I have taken various texts and cross-referenced them to create this book, which, compared to ancient methods, is very precise. Following this method to treat people, I have never found it to be ineffective; often, one treatment leads to recovery. I myself suffered from a long illness and weakness in Yicheng, and I also used this method to recover. </p>
<p>Method for locating acupuncture points: First, identify two points. Have the patient stand upright and level. Take a fine string made of wax and ensure it does not stretch or compress. Place it against the firm, muscular part of the foot, with men on the left and women on the right. The front end of the string should align with the tip of the big toe, and the back end should be at the center of the heel. Pull the string back, following the shape of the calf muscle, all the way up to where it meets the horizontal line across the middle of the knee joint. Then, have the patient part their hair to both sides to expose the scalp seam. From the hairline, divide it equally to the back of the head, and then have them sit straight. For the end of the string that you previously cut, align it with the tip of the nose, and pull the string upward, following the seam of the scalp down to the back of the head, then following the spine, guide the string down until its end. Mark the vertebrae with an ink dot (the ink dot is not the acupuncture point).<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a></p></div>

Practice this for twenty days, and the evil qi will recede; after sixty days, minor ailments will improve; after one hundred days, major illnesses will be eliminated. The three corpses and hidden worms will diminish, and the skin will glow.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: Tuberculosis is due to fatigue, arising from an innate deficiency combined with constant depletion from external factors. The seven emotions are strongly affected, desires exceed limits, essence is depleted and qi is exhausted, fire is stored in the kidney, the heart is disturbed, fire dries the lungs, the lung orifices are unclear, true water does not nourish, and body fluids become scorched, leading to phlegm, cough, bloody vomit, and night sweats. In the afternoon, there is bone steaming, with excess upward and deficiency downward, skin burns and the face turns pale, limbs are weak, and urination is scant and painful. It could be due to the essence not being secured, resulting in harm; or external kidney contraction causing floating qi, leading to wheezing. All these are signs of deficiency and fear; immediate action must be taken to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Guiding method: With palms open and relaxed, casually rub and friction, morning and evening massage both sides of the ribs, kidney points, ear roots, and Yongquan point one hundred forty times for better retention of essence and multiple effects. In the morning, consume human milk wine, drink clean infant urine, or take circulating water, using ginger and jujubes to warm the spleen. Alternatively, use autumn stone salt to nourish yin and reduce fire. If one is too deficient to take ginseng, it is advisable to follow this method to obtain qi and effect. Even for extremely difficult-to-treat conditions, using a few strips of good umbilical cord, dried to a powder, taking two qian with good wine to adjust, proves effective.

<p>&quot;The Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot; states: The case of Xu Hua Shumo suffered from virtual weakness and excessive sweating during sleep, with a bluish-yellow complexion, cold pain below the knees, and no sweating, alongside a dry heat in the abdomen. The doctor used ginger and other warming herbs to treat him, forbidding him from drinking water for five days and nights, and also prohibited him from combing his hair, treating him for cold symptoms, according to the practices advised by Dai Ren. Dai Ren said: &quot;Your illness is not difficult to cure, but it is challenging to manage afterward. I fear that once you recover, you will neglect proper care and your condition will return.&quot; Xu Sheng replied: &quot;I dare not.&quot;</p>
<p>Dai Ren first administered pills and herbal mixtures to move the intestines, then allowed him to drink ice water to quench his thirst after the heart&#39;s heat was reduced. Dai Ren also recommended bathing, and within a few days, Xu Sheng’s complexion brightened and became moist. Then, he made porridge with river water to nourish the spleen and stomach, as river water can assist in urination. He combined this with herbal formulations like blood-activating Angelica pills, ginseng and Bupleurum powder, Wuling powder, and wood fragrance and white atractylodes powder. The illness substantially improved; sweating during sleep stopped, his feet felt warm daily, and he regained appetite. Dai Ren often said: &quot;This is fundamentally a lung obstruction, and should be treated with cooling remedies.&quot; He mentioned that water manifests as tears in the eyes, sweat on the skin, and urine below. Normally, grains are abundant while water is scarce; is it possible to completely avoid water? If drinking is forbidden, it will lead to inner depletion, which gives rise to dry heat. When a person is not thirsty, they also will not drink water. After Xu Sheng recovered, he indeed forgot the restrictions, and the illness recurred. Dai Ren had already left, and he subsequently passed away.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Medical Case of Xue Ji states: A county official, Han Yongzhi, experienced excessive lust, restlessness leading to thirst, continuous drinking of water, frequent urination with dribbling, constipation, expectoration as if it were surging, a flushed face, a tongue full of prickles, cracked and dry lips, a scorching body, sometimes feeling as if there were prickles with an unstable sensation, and feet so hot as if burned. The pulse in the left three positions was rapid and chaotic; this indicated a deficiency of kidney yin, with yang not being anchored, manifesting outwardly. Due to excessive heat and a lack of cooling, it was determined there was no water, and thus, the yin needed to be vigorously replenished. Therefore, a prescription of modified Eight Flavor Pill was prepared with an ounce of cinnamon; it was decocted in water into six bowls, cooled and given to drink. He slept soundly for half the day, and by evening, he drank another warm bowl, which led to the complete alleviation of all symptoms. The next day, however, he felt chilled, his feet were cold up to his knees, and the symptoms returned, indicating a lack of fire; thus, yang needed to be replenished. Urgently, four doses of Eight Flavor Pill were administered, and all symptoms promptly receded.<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a></p></div>

In early winter, he experienced persistent fever, constant thirst, a buildup of phlegm, continuous seminal emissions, and frequent, aching urination. He tried remedies such as Siwu and Erchen, but his chest felt oppressed, his appetite was poor, and his bowel movements were unsatisfactory.

<p>Minister Wang had weak vital energy. In the years Bingwu and Dingwei, due to the stress of examination season, he became ill from exhaustion. By December, his illness intensified; he experienced high fever, profuse tears, red eyes, dark complexion, shortness of breath suggesting near collapse, and a markedly strong pulse that felt hollow. His tongue was dry and seemed prickly; this indicated true cold internally and false heat externally. Therefore, he first took the Ten Vitality Decoction. I said: &quot;Since you have taken this, your pulse should become more constricted and favorable.&quot; After a brief deep sleep, he awoke feeling an increase in chills, and his pulse turned faint and thin like silk, revealing the true manifestation of deficiency and cold. I administered an ounce of ginseng, three dimes of cooked Aconite, boiled it in water, and he calmed down. During the night, his pulse became weak again. I prescribed two ounces of ginseng and five dimes of cooked Aconite and he improved once more.

Ten years ago, he suffered from an internal injury accompanied by external afflictions. A doctor prescribed a purging remedy, and while the fever subsided after several days, his weakness did not recover. He experienced chest fullness, shortness of breath, and dizziness. He called upon me for treatment, and I administered a tonifying middle energizing decoction, periodically giving him Eastern Garden&#39;s formula for dissipating fullness, and other herbs like dried tangerine peel and zhu ru, to regulate and stabilize him. However, since the root of the disease was not completely eradicated, the dizziness occasionally recurred, though not severely. This year, due to the tough journey to Hangzhou and excessive desires, his dizziness worsened upon returning home. Several doctors treated him with remedies to dispel wind, dampness, and phlegm, including Fang Feng, Qiang Huo, Jing Jie, Nan Xing, Ban Xia, and Cang Zhu, but his condition deteriorated significantly, with fainting episodes occurring over ten times a day. He would regain consciousness briefly, but any movement or turning would induce fainting, leaving his family in despair and calling out for help.

However, I feared that after recovering, they might not be able to rise or move for several years. The patient said: &quot;As long as I have life, I am willing to lie down.&quot; I prescribed a strong tonic for qi and blood, doubling the amounts of ginseng and astragalus, and possibly adding aconite to help guide the treatment, combining a large dosage for three applications a day. Additionally, I prepared ginseng extract and made pills similar to Ziheche wan and Biyin wan for intermittent use. After regulating the condition for more than two months, with over two hundred applications of decoction and three to five doses of pills, using five to six jin of ginseng, the symptoms gradually improved, with eating and drinking returning to normal, but the patient was still unable to move.

He discovered my rudimentary writings on medicines and pulse diagnosis, and sent an envoy to invite me. His letter was heartfelt, and I was moved by his words, so I went to see him. By the time I arrived, his condition had worsened. I reviewed the medicines he was taking, which mainly included the Four Substances, along with Anemarrhena and Ephedra as adjustments. Upon diagnosing his pulse, it was large and rapid, yet extremely soft. I said: “Your central qi is greatly cold, which in turn makes the medicine ineffective.” I then prescribed Gui Pi Decoction with an extra dose of cinnamon and five qian of ginseng, advising that he would sleep soundly that night. After ten days, his sweating ceased, and his seminal loss improved. I further prescribed Shao Yao Dan to supplement his central qi invigorating, and after a month of intermittent use, he began to feel better.</p>

I recommended the Eight-Treasure Pill and Ten Complements Decoction, adding thirty large dates. After over fifty days, his spirit gradually improved, and his muscles began to fill out, leading him to write to express his gratitude. One day, he consumed a large amount of tiger bone wine, but his constipation persisted. Physicians all stated that the Eight-Treasure Pill was not suitable for long-term use, and that the Ten Complements Decoction should exclude cinnamon, instead using Anemarrhena and Asparagus as substitutes.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the southern capital, Xu Lun&#39;s granddaughter coughed up blood and phlegm. In June, I examined her and found her pulse to be two inches like rotten cotton, with several two-inch pulses. I said: &quot;Gold and fire are adversaries; the lungs should not be abundant, yet they are swollen. The rebellious pulse is evident; there is cause for concern in autumn.&quot; On the fifth day of the eighth month, I examined her again, and the abundance of the lungs changed to a fine and rapid pulse, while the weakness in the kidneys changed to one that was severe and strong. I said: &quot;In the year of Wu Wu, the Lesser Yin governs the heavens; the two-inch pulse does not correspond. Now, the inch should not respond but is instead large; the cun should be floating and large, yet it is sinking and fine. The reversal of the dimensions indicates death; the lungs reaching suspension mean death within twelve days. Calculating the period indicates she would die on the sixteenth day. However, since she can still eat, she has surpassed that time; moreover, both the sixteenth and seventeenth are days of metal, so death is not immediate. On the eighteenth, it transitions to the chilly dew time, which coincides with a day of fire. The scriptures say: &#39;When the hand Taiyin&#39;s Qi is exhausted, the day of Bing is severe; the day of Ding brings death,&#39; referring to the fire days. The hour of Yin is when Qi and blood flow into the lungs; if they cannot flow, then suspension is certain, and she will surely die at the hour of Yin on the eighteenth.&quot; Upon hearing this, Lun wept bitterly. Because she could eat, he still did not want to believe it. Indeed, she passed away before dawn on the eighteenth.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a></p></div>

Upon examining the right pulse, which was weak and soft, it became evident that there was a deficiency of spleen and lung qi, leading to a condition where fire could not generate earth. Consequently, I used a formula to tonify the center and augment qi, adding Schisandra, Job&#39;s tears, ginger, and cinnamon to three qian.

In October, she spat out a significant amount of fresh blood. In one day, she consumed only a bowl of porridge, was unable to digest large meats, had loose stools, and was confined to bed, with a pulse of seven beats. I said: The principle is not to save her, which is widely acknowledged. However, if she can solely listen to me and avoid outside distractions, there is a chance to save one in ten. I prescribed three doses daily, using five qian of ginseng, one qian each of cinnamon and prepared aconite, three qian of astragalus and poria, two qian of rehmannia and peony, and one qian of dried tangerine peel, totaling about seventy doses.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man of fifty years required several sheng of wine each day; if he did not drink on an empty stomach, both his hands and feet trembled. When he drank one sheng, this tremor slightly diminished, but if he became drunk, his hands and feet would become immobile. It was commonly said that this condition was a sickness caused by alcohol, known as &quot;tremor wind.&quot; After several days of acupuncture and medication with no effect, it was suspected that he had worms. He then took a remedy called “Heaven&#39;s Crown Powder,” and expelled an object resembling a black plum, which had legs and was similar to a spider.

However, it causes the internal organs to flip and the sinews to loosen, making the hundred pulses sway, merely to provide transient pleasure, without realizing the difficulty of sustaining it.&quot;<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There was a woman who had not yet departed from life, and in an instant she passed away; it is fortunate that such a malady has a day like today. After two years of renunciation of desires, this is the conduct of a true man, and he may harvest what he has sown in the twilight of life. But I wonder, can he do nothing in this regard? Or is it that he cannot do anything? If he does nothing, it is like the sun rising and the Big Dipper turning; if he cannot do anything, he merely finds peace in idleness. The male and female energies of a person&#39;s body embrace each other and do not separate, which is why there is constancy in a hundred years. The yang wants to rise and escape, but the yin pulls it down, and it cannot detach; the yin wants to descend and escape, but the yang pulls it up, and it cannot detach either. Indeed, the disease may not be singular; the energies may often combat each other, but they must ultimately harmonize. Only through great drunkenness and extreme labor can their regular balance be disrupted. When the two energies take advantage of this chaos, separation occurs. It does not require much; even a small fraction may escape, resulting in a portion that is solitary and unpaired, leaving the essence unable to govern itself. The key to remedy lies in seeking out the gaps and sealing them securely, cutting off the claws and establishing a firm foundation, refining the stone to mend the sky, and this is not mere embellishment of words.<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one does not recognize the source of the illness but searches broadly in hopes of some gain, even if one daily takes ginseng, it will only deplete one’s wealth without yielding real benefits. Those who are in the upper forms of deficiency may perceive illusions like spirits; those in the lower forms are unseeing and unhearing, akin to being deaf and blind. The upper-deficient feel light and are drenched in sweat, while the lower-deficient feel heavy, with much flesh turning blue and purple. </p>
<p>In the past, there was a newly prominent noble who, riding a horse, was full of pride and joy; before he could return home, he laughed and then perished—this is an example of upper deficiency. Conversely, there are those who sleep and encounter nightmare-like experiences, feeling as if beaten, with blood oozing from the nine orifices—this is an example of lower deficiency. </p>
<p>When both upper and lower deficiencies occur simultaneously, this is a severe and sudden case, rarely seen. If deficiencies are skewed side to side, with the left from above and the right from below, it follows the same principle of the soul rising and the spirit descending. However, the treatment varies based on whether the condition is newly developed or longstanding, and the cost of medication is significant. For acute ailments, where yin and yang are in discord, it is appropriate to use remedies that address the imbalance.<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those suffering from long-term illness, the balance of Yin and Yang gradually enters the body. It is essential to support the original vitality and nourish the right, which should be accomplished with gentle remedies. If a prolonged illness is treated with strong medicines, it may only worsen the depletion. </p>
<p>In terms of treatment: for those with upward depletion, use seven parts Yang medicine and three parts Yin medicine taken at night, guiding the Yin to support the Yang; for those with downward depletion, use seven parts Yin medicine and three parts Yang medicine taken during the day, guiding the Yang to support the Yin. By continually guiding and guiding again, Yin and Yang will unconsciously embrace each other. Even when one climbs high or descends deep, there will be no fear; even when launching an attack, there will be no harm.</p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;When Yin is even and Yang is hidden, the spirit will be well.&quot; This is precisely what it means. A skilled practitioner causes the true Yang in the Kan (water) to rise, resulting in the energy of the whole body feeling as if, at the winter solstice when the first Yang is born, reeds sway lightly in the wind, and heaven and earth harmonize with that Yang. Conversely, causing the true Yin in the Li (fire) to descend, leads to the body&#39;s energy feeling like, at the summer solstice when the first Yin is born, cicadas respond in unison, and heaven and earth harmonize with that Yin. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Jin Daobin was presented before the case, and the following year I began to inquire about his condition. Now I will outline the treatment: The illness of Daobin is one of the true yang&#39;s withdrawal. True yang originates from the mingling of parental essence at the moment of conception, forming a small pearl of vital energy, which becomes the foundation of the fetus. Therefore, while in the mother&#39;s womb, it first forms two branches, namely the two kidneys. The kidneys are the water organs, and true yang resides within them. In the &quot;I Ching,&quot; the yang within the hexagram Kan refers to this true yang. Since true yang takes the kidneys as its dwelling, it remains hidden within the water, firm and unmoving, silently managing the whole body, thus capable of sustaining life for a hundred years. However, indulgence without restraint leads to the gradual depletion of kidney water, causing the true yang to start revealing itself. Yang is the force that nourishes upward; when it becomes apparent, the spirit sweats profusely, the eyes gleam, and the face appears flushed. Its exuberance is so vigorous that who can grasp it? The spirit wanders, and there has been no peace for three years.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, every year as winter arrives, it manifests, and in spring it becomes more severe. This happens because there is no foundation to store the winter&#39;s water, nor a basis for the spring&#39;s trees to thrive. Consequently, the waist and spine are strained, the governing vessel contracts and does not relax, leading to dizziness and instability, resembling signs of wind. This all originates from self-harming one’s roots of vitality. The processes of growth, transformation, storage, and flourishing are interconnected; any failure in one aspect serves as evidence of illness. Currently, those who store are few, and those who nurture even fewer, leaving no doubt in the presence of disease. However, I assert that there is room for healing, as there are methods for treatment. Furthermore, after experiencing the changes of cold and heat, yin and yang, conditions gradually emerge, and upon examining human affairs over three years as if in an isolated realm, residing in a besieged city, one cannot predict the day and night of survival; those enduring afflictions will undoubtedly suffer deeply. Thus, I recognize the possibility of healing. Initially, we treat with decoctions, employing three methods within the prescription: one to dispel the cold and rigidity, one to rectify weakness, and one to replenish and stabilize deficiency. True yang disperses outward, just as one searches for a lost child, one must exhaust all avenues, and ingesting this formula indeed yields great effects. Hence, an external approach is employed to guide it, further advancing to treat the root cause.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fundamental method of governance indeed possesses opportunities unseen by spirits and gods, which cannot be described verbally. Let us explain it through the principle of observing things. For those who raise a thousand fish, they must place certain creatures in the pond; otherwise, the fish will rise and scatter in a thunderstorm. Although fish tend to hide, they naturally prefer movement. By placing heavy bottom-dwelling creatures, the fish are encouraged to remain still, drawn to the same environment, harmonizing principle with the essence. Therefore, in managing the true yang&#39;s soaring and leaping, one must not rely on tortoises and soft-shelled turtles to pull them down and make them hide. This notion directly aligns with stabilizing the primordial essence and ensuring peace, employing the eight cables to align with the earth’s veins, as previously discussed in the methods of disrupting shells to establish a great pole. However, this method should not be treated lightly; if it is, the fish will become chaotic below. Next, use a method of half-invitation and half-retrieval; then, further, employ a method of firm sealing and reinforcement. Although the sealing and reinforcing method lacks transmission in the world, many wise sages have elucidated its principles.<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Observing the names of the medicinal formulas, some call it &quot;Three Talents Fengtong Pill,&quot; while others refer to it as &quot;Golden Lock Zhengyuan Elixir.&quot; These serve to seal and lock the true yang, preventing it from leaking outward, which is self-evident—first, one must align their heart with this understanding. The sayings from the ancestor Jing Dun in the previous text, that adding oil makes the lamp brighter and adding ash to the furnace keeps the fire alive, have long been stated before. </p>
<p>Indeed, if the true yang can return to its abode and blend harmoniously with the true yin, then clarity and brightness will manifest within oneself, and one can maintain a worry-free existence for a hundred years. However, the illness of Dao Bin begins with indulging in emotions. Although there may be slight recovery now, if one does not guard against excessive emotional attachment, they will inevitably suffer. </p>
<p>One must accumulate essence to strengthen themselves, gather energy to protect themselves, and build spirit to govern oneself. Furthermore, with a thousand days of steadfastness, one could potentially reach the heights like the heavens, impervious to the damage of axes and hatchets. Should one endure the long passage of time, it becomes challenging to persist. Those who attain success in distant lands, weathering snow at the borders and returning grey-haired, are indeed rare. </p>
<p>In the previous text, abstaining from desires for two years is deemed sufficient for a man to achieve longevity, and this has also been previously stated. Now, when using medicinal stones for rejuvenation, one must not avoid speaking harsh truths. I lack self-assessment, yet I attempt to block the raging tide with a single reed.
