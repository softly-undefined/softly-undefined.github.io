      <div><p>The Complete Collection of Medical Books from Ancient to Modern, Volume 323</p>
<p><strong>Door of Desire for Sleep</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of liver heat disease, the urine is first yellow, abdominal pain leads to excessive lying down, body heat is present, and if heat contests, it causes manic speech and fright. There is fullness and pain in the flanks, and the limbs are restless and cannot find peace in sleep. If the condition is severe with the metal elements, there will be significant sweating. If the qi is rebellious, it leads to metal death. If the qi reverses, there will be headaches, and the pulse will rise to the head. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The liver governs the smooth flow of qi, hence the yellow urine. The liver meridian relates to the lower abdomen, thus causing abdominal pain. The liver stores the soul, and if the soul is disturbed, it leads to excessive lying down. Wood and fire govern qi, hence the body heat. This refers to internal causes of the illness. A contest of heat means the struggle between cold and heat, referring to external evils. Disturbance of the soul leads to manic speech. Liver disease causes fright, and since the liver meridian spreads through the flanks, this results in fullness and pain there. When lying down, blood returns to the liver; if liver qi is harmed, one cannot sleep. Rebellious qi indicates extreme heat reversing internally. If heat is excessive, it ascends to the head, hence headache and dizziness.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Syncope</strong></p>
<p>In cases of liver-yin syncope, there will be swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, difficulty urinating, a desire for excessive lying down, knee flexion, contraction and swelling of the yin, and internal heat in the thigh. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the foot meridian of the liver experiences syncope, it leads to swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, and difficulty in urination, along with contraction and swelling of the yin. The liver governs the tendons; the knee represents the convergence of tendons. When the meridians are reversed, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, leading to a desire to lie down and flex the knees. The liver yin of wood and fire governs qi; if the nourishing function is reversed, it causes internal swelling and heat in the thighs.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Key Diagnoses</strong></p>
<p>In autumn, when the qi is sharp, and summer&#39;s heat lingers, if the illness persists, one will tend to sleep excessively.<br>[Note: The autumn qi affects the skin and the related channels from summer, causing qi to not circulate outward, thus leading to a desire for sleep.]</p>
<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Six Essential Elements</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming governs the heavens; at the beginning of its phase, its effect is that illness tends to induce peaceful sleep.<br>[Note: Damp soil is associated with the illness.]</p>
<p><strong>Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Sea of Marrow</strong></p>
<p>When the Sea of Marrow is abundant, there is a lightness and strength, causing one to exceed their limits. When it is insufficient, there will be dizziness, buzzing in the ears, weakness in the shins, lack of sight, lethargy, and an inclination to rest.<br>[Note: According to Yao, essence and fluid nourish the brain&#39;s marrow and flow beneath to the yin aspects, thus when the Sea of Marrow is abundant, the legs are light and strong. The marrow rises from the cavities of the bones and connects upward to the brain; hence, abundance may lead to excess. When the Sea of Marrow is insufficient, essence is exhausted, which causes the ears to ring and vision to diminish. Lack of fluid causes issues in the bones, leading to weakness in the shins and lethargy.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>The Great Confusion Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What causes people to sleep excessively? Qi Bo replied: This is due to the large size of the person’s intestines and stomach, combined with dampness of the skin, which prevents the division of flesh. A large intestine and stomach cause the defensive qi to linger for long; damp skin prevents the division of flesh, leading to sluggish movement. The defensive qi circulates in the daytime in the yang phase and in the nighttime in the yin phase. Hence, when the yang qi is exhausted, one sleeps; when the yin qi is depleted, one wakes. Therefore, a large intestine and stomach cause the defensive qi to linger for long, and damp skin together with an inability to divide flesh results in sluggishness. When it stays in the yin for a long time, its qi becomes impure, leading to a desire for sleep, hence the excessive sleeping. When the intestines are small, the skin is soft and relaxed, and the division of flesh is efficient, the defensive qi lingers longer in the yang phase, resulting in less need to sleep. </p>
<p>[Note: The defensive qi circulates in the yang phase during the day and in the yin phase at night. When the yang qi is exhausted and enters the yin, one sleeps; when the yin qi is exhausted and exits the yang, one wakes. Thus, lingering too long in the yin leads to excessive sleeping, while lingering too long in the yang leads to less need for sleep.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What then causes sudden excessive sleeping? Qi Bo replied: Pathogenic qi lingers in the upper burner, obstructing it, making it unresponsive. When one eats as if drinking soup, the defensive qi lingers long in the yin and does not circulate, which leads to sudden excessive sleeping. </p>
<p>[Note: The term &quot;unusual channels&quot; refers to those which do not follow the normal pattern of circulating in the yang during the day and in the yin at night. This condition arises when pathogenic qi lingers in the upper burner, resulting in obstruction. When food fills the middle burner, it causes the defensive qi to remain in the lower yin for too long and unable to ascend to the yang, hence the sudden excessive sleeping.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Classic Text on Bian Que&#39;s Difficulties</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spleen Disease</strong></p>
<p>If one obtains the pulse of the spleen, the external symptoms are a yellowish face, propensity to belch, good at thinking and tasting; the internal symptoms are a sensation of movement around the navel, pressing down feels firm like pain; the illness manifests as abdominal distension, inability to digest food, heavy body with joint pain, laziness leading to excessive sleep, and limbs that are not retracted. If these symptoms are present, it is the spleen; if not, it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Jinkui Yaolüe</strong> 【Han - Zhang Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Just Wanting to Sleep</strong></p>
<p>The section on Fox Possession states: In patients, the pulse is rapid without heat, mildly restless, silently wanting to sleep, and sweating. In the initial three to four days, the eyes are red like a dove’s eyes. After seven to eight days, the corners of the eyes turn dark. If one can eat, pus has already formed, and a formula of red adzuki beans and angelica is recommended. The section on the Five Organs states: When the evil crying makes the soul unsettled, it indicates a deficiency of blood and Qi; a deficiency of blood and Qi pertains to the heart. If heart Qi is deficient, the person becomes fearful, closes their eyes wanting to sleep, dreams of distant journeys, and the spirit becomes scattered, leading the soul to wander aimlessly. A deficiency in Yin Qi leads to epilespy; a deficiency in Yang Qi leads to mania.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>The Living Person&#39;s Book</strong> </p>
<p><strong>By Zhu Gong (Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four Signs of Excessive Sleep</strong></p>
<p>If a patient has a floating pulse in both wrists, experiences headache, body heat, often sweats, feels heavy, and breathes with wheezing while displaying no signs of energy but a desire to sleep, this is indicative of Wind-Heat syndrome. Wind-Heat should not be treated with sweating; it is advisable to use Wei Rui Decoction. If the patient has a floating pulse, dizziness, severe pain, and aversion to cold, this indicates a Wind-Cold syndrome. After ten days, if the pulse is floating, fine, and there is a desire for sleep, this suggests that the exterior has resolved. If there is fullness in the chest or pain in the side, administer Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the pulse is merely floating, Ma Huang Decoction should be used. If a patient has a sinking, fine pulse in both wrists and a strong desire to sleep, this indicates a Shaoyin syndrome; one should urgently prepare Si Ni Decoction to revive the Yang, without delay. If the symptoms resemble those of a cold, with heavy limbs and a sudden desire to sleep, it is important to examine the upper and lower lips. If there are sores on the upper lip, it indicates pestilence harming the internal organs; if there are sores on the lower lip, it indicates pestilence affecting the lower body, which should be treated as Huohuo disorder.</p>
<p><strong>The Ten Books of Dongyuan</strong> </p>
<p><strong>By Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heat Injuring Qi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In the case of internal injuries, the Qi of the heart and lungs has already been severed from the exterior, leading to lethargy and a strong desire to sleep, with limbs feeling heavy and unresponsive. This is called Heat injuring Yuan Qi; the spleen governs the limbs. The classics say: Heat injures Qi. It is also said: Heat causes bones to waste and muscles to weaken. This is what is meant.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Spleen and Stomach Deficiency Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are weak, there is laziness and a tendency to sleep, with limbs lacking strength. In the autumn dryness, damp heat is minimally reduced, leading to feelings of heaviness and joint pain, dry mouth and tongue, tasteless food, irregular bowel movements, frequent urination, a lack of appetite, and poor digestion. Additionally, signs of lung disease may appear, with chills and a feeling of melancholy. The complexion is poor and discordant, indicating a failure of yang energy to expand. Thus, one should promote yang and invigorate qi with the &quot;Ascending Yang and Nourishing Stomach Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In the case of a cold damage transforming into yin, excessive sleep occurs. When one is drowsy with closed eyes, it indicates that yin is dominant in closing. A silence without desire to speak signifies a predominance of yin in stillness. If there is a return of symptoms after clearing the exterior with a Yangming pathology involving fullness in the chest and pain in the flanks, accompanied by sweating and nasal dryness, one should use &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang.&quot; If the pulse is floating, consider &quot;Qiang Huo Chong He Tang,&quot; and in winter, &quot;Ma Huang Tang.&quot; If Yangming heat is lurking within and leads to excessive sleep, administer &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang.&quot; For a Shaoyin pulse that is deep and thin, with spontaneous diarrhea and a desire to vomit accompanied by thirst and drowsiness, &quot;Si Ni Tang&quot; should be enhanced with Ren Shen and Fu Ling to nourish yin and restore yang. Alternatively, if there is a febrile disease followed by sweating, and the pulse becomes deep, thin, and the body feels cold, initially quiet but gradually becoming drowsy with a desire to sleep without awareness, it is crucial to quickly administer &quot;Si Ni Tang&quot; to warm the limbs. Otherwise, there may be cases of deep sleep leading to death. In cases of lily syndrome where there is sweating upon closing the eyes, wind-heat conditions often do not improve. The spirit may become disoriented due to misfortune. Each condition should be treated according to its details. However, if sweating leads to a return of deep sleep, it indicates the restoration of the righteous qi, and no medication is necessary.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Typhoid Fever</strong></p>
<p>The protective qi of the body moves in the daytime with the yang and at night with the yin. In waking, it operates through yang; in sleeping, it operates through yin. When yang qi is deficient and yin qi is abundant, the eyes close, leading to excessive sleep, indicating that the pathogenic qi transmits to the yin rather than the yang. When in a daze with closed eyes, the yin naturally closes. When one is silent and speaks little, it signifies the dominance of yin which is associated with stillness. The text states: If a person with a taiyang disease has been ill for ten days and the pulse is floating and thin, and they have a tendency to sleep, it indicates that the exterior aspect is resolved. If the nose is dry and they sweat little while being prone to sleep, it suggests that pathogenic heat attacks from within, not from the surface, leading to an underlying heat that causes a preference for sleep. In cases of the three yang combined with illness, there is a strong desire to sleep; if the eyes close, there may be sweating and delirium, indicating the presence of heat. If there is night sweating, it reflects stomach heat and also a tendency for excessive sleep. Conditions like wind-warmth or fox-restrictions may present similar symptoms, and differentiation is necessary.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to a lesser yin disease, the pulse is weak, submerged, and fine, with the patient desiring to lie down. There is sweating without agitation, and a desire to vomit. If this persists for five or six days, and then there is diarrhea accompanied by restlessness and inability to sleep, it indicates a fatal condition. Cold damage with a weak, submerged pulse clearly signifies a yin condition, especially since the patient wishes to lie still and not move. Sweating has already occurred, showing there is no yang condition internally. If the heart is not agitated and there is a continual desire to vomit, this indicates that the yang pathogen has dispersed and the yin pathogen is causing trouble, thus it is urgent to expel the cold. If there is a failure to warm the body, for five or six days the diarrhea will result in chaos in both the upper and lower regions. If the patient does not exhibit restlessness, the true yang in the kidneys has not dispersed. However, with added restlessness and inability to sleep, this is a clear sign of an uncontrollable state that surely leads to death. The previous mismanagement caused this condition, rather than it being inherently incurable. I possess an extraordinary remedy, called &quot;Turning Yang to Rescue.&quot; It involves using one tael each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and roasted jujube seeds, along with five qian of poria and two qian of cinnamon, boiled together in water. This single dose can calm the patient and restore health. This remedy employs ginseng to revive the exhausted, white atractylodes and poria to eliminate water dampness causing diarrhea, cinnamon to warm the center and dispel cold, and jujube seeds to calm the mind and relieve restlessness. When used appropriately, its effects will surely be as remarkable as before.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Fang (Formulas)</strong></p>

<p>Human hearts are dull and obstructed, often forgetting joy and slumber; the flowers of the commercial rue are dried for a hundred days, then ground into powder. At dusk, take a small spoonful with water before sleep, and thoughts of desired matters will awaken during dreams. 【Su Song】<br>Eating to satisfaction leads to sleep; excessive eating burdens the limbs, making one feel heavy and drowsy. After a meal, this can be severe. Use one sheng of barley flour, one liang of pepper, and fry them together, with three liang of dried ginger ground into powder. Take a small spoonful, with warm water, three times a day. 【&quot;Zhouhou&quot;】<br>People indulge in sleep: sun-dried flower and leaf powder, taking one to two qian with soup can promote healing. 【Yang Yaofu&#39;s Recipe】<br>Horse skull bone is used to treat excessive sleepiness, preventing slumber; burn the bone to ash and take a small spoonful with water, three times a day and once at night.

<p>Acupuncture:</p>
<p>The “Thousand Golden Prescriptions” states: When the body feels heavy and food is tasteless, and there is a feeling of emptiness beneath the heart, with a constant desire to lie down and a preference for sleep, one should needle the stomach and the upper stomach area. The “Medical Essentials” states: For drowsiness, use moxibustion on the second segment of the ring finger. Bend the finger to locate it.</p>
<p>Medical Case:</p>
<p>The “Rumen Shiqin” states: A young boy under the jurisdiction of the magistrate in Chenzhou, suffered from sleep without waking for three days. Various doctors treated him for sleep disturbances, some wanting to use moxibustion, while others proposed using formulas like Da Jing Wan and mercury pills. His father said: This child usually has no illness, so how can he suddenly be disturbed? They consulted the diviner, who examined both hands; the pulses were all peaceful and harmonious, stating: The pulse for wind agitation should be robust and strong, yet now it is calm; thus, it is not wind agitation. He secretly asked the wet nurse, did she drink heavily three days before? She laughed and said: Madam provided fine brewed wine, which was very delicious; I drank a jar and then slept. The wine, being sweet and rich, with its essence filling the milk, caused the child to be drunk as well. They then ground licorice, dried kudzu, kudzu flowers, reduced cardamom, and guanzhong, boiled them into a juice, and he instantly awoke.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The &quot;Treasure of Health&quot; states: In the third month of the year Jiaxu during the Yuan dynasty, a man named Chang De Fu suffered from a cold and sought treatment. Upon examination, I found his two hands and six pulses to be deep and rapid, his body felt cool to the touch, his limbs were cold and reversed, he had faint purple spots on his skin, and his lips and gums were cracked and colorless. He had a dry throat and hoarse voice, remained silently wanting to sleep, could not close his eyes, and was mentally distressed and restless. This indicated deep heat and severe reversal, transforming into a condition resembling madness, and it was quite urgent. When I inquired with the attendants, they said he had felt a cold, experienced headaches, body stiffness, fever, and chills. A physician had prescribed Bai Jie San, leading to sweating that affected his back, yet he did not improve. Other doctors also induced sweating, resulting in his condition worsening. I noted that he had long accumulated heat internally from rich foods, which had dried up his fluids. Excessive sweating further depleted his fluids, resulting in the transformation to Yangming syndrome, hence his difficulty in bowel movements. I urgently prescribed Da Cheng Qi Decoction to purge him, and he was able to change his clothes; thereafter, I used Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction, and his condition improved by more than half; later, I administered Huang Lian Xi Jiao Decoction, and after several days he became stable.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The official Cheng Yuan asked me to treat his son who had been suffering from typhoid for eight or nine days since early March. The pulse was found to be deep, thin, and weak; the limbs were cold; there was diarrhea and abdominal pain; his eyes did not want to open; he often hugged his underarms; he felt drowsy and had the urge to sleep; his mouth and tongue were dry. He then said, &quot;The previous doctor left a prescription for Bai Hu Decoction with ginseng. Can it be taken?&quot; I replied, &quot;Although Bai Hu Decoction claims to treat dry mouths and tongues, it is not suitable in all cases. There are three reasons why it should not be used for this condition: First, &#39;Shang Han Lun&#39; states that it cannot be recklessly used before the beginning of summer and after the end of the hot season; second, it should not be used when there is no sweating and thirst in a taiyang disorder; third, given that the patient exhibits all signs of a yin condition and that it is still chilly in spring, it is not appropriate to use it.&quot; Zhang Zhongjing said: &quot;For clear diarrhea, one must urgently treat the interior, it is advisable to use Si Ni Decoction.&quot; Thus, I prepared Si Ni Decoction with three taels, added one tael of ginseng, more than ten slices of fresh ginger, and nine stalks of scallion whites, boiled them together in five large cups of water until only three cups remained, strained it, and divided it into three doses for the patient to take in one day. By night, the diarrhea ceased and the hands and feet warmed up; the next day, he sweated profusely and recovered. I then administered several doses of Li Zhong Decoction, and he was cured.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Not Able to Lie Down</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi Neijing - Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Illness</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: Why is it that some people cannot lie down in peace? Qibo replied: It is because the organ is injured, and when the essence is properly settled, peace is achieved. When the essence is deficient, one cannot find comfort. The &quot;Taisu&quot; volume 30 states, &quot;When the essence is lacking, one cannot find peace in lying down.&quot; In volume 12 of &quot;Jiayi,&quot; it states, &quot;When emotions lean on something, one cannot lie down in peace.&quot; Thus, people cannot easily ascertain their illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The essence produced by the stomach can settle within the five organs, bringing peace. If it is retained in the stomach, it leads to restlessness. If there is obstruction, it results in abscesses, hence people cannot easily identify their ailments.]</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Why is it that people cannot recline? Qibo answered: The lung is the cover of the organs; when lung qi is abundant, the pulse becomes large. A large pulse makes it impossible to recline. This is discussed within the balance of yin and yang.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The lung influences the hundred vessels and transports essence to the organs; when lung qi is rebellious, it becomes strong, leading to a large pulse. A large pulse then prevents one from lying down.]</strong><a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p>
<h3>Reverse Theory</h3>
<p>If the vital energy cannot lie down to rest and makes a sound, this reflects the reverse of Yangming. The three Yang meridians are meant to flow downward, but now they reverse and ascend, hence the sound during rest. Yangming refers to the stomach channel, which is the sea of the six fu organs, and its energy also flows downward. When Yangming is reversed and cannot follow its proper path, one cannot lie down. The &quot;Lower Classic&quot; states: if the stomach is not harmonious, one cannot rest peacefully; this is what it refers to.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Yangming stomach channel is the sea of the five zang and six fu organs. The blood and energy it produces ascend to the lungs through the great collateral and descend to the foot&#39;s lesser yin through the stomach channel. If Yangming reverses and cannot follow its path, one cannot lie down, hence there is sound during rest. The fluids of Yangming descend to the kidneys with the energy; if Yangming reverses and cannot follow its path, the water and energy of the kidneys may ascend and disrupt Yangming, resulting in disharmony of the stomach and inability to rest peacefully.</p>
<p>Now, if one cannot lie down and experiences wheezing, this indicates the presence of water energy. Water flows along the paths of fluids, and the kidneys are the water organ, governing fluids, rest, and wheezing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Yangming reverses and does not follow its path downward into the kidneys, then the waters and energies of the kidneys may flow upwards along the pathways of fluids to enter the stomach, causing disharmony of the stomach and inability to rest peacefully. Therefore, the kidneys are the water organ, responsible for storing fluids, and also regulate rest and wheezing.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Critique of Conditions</strong></p>
<p>When the condition of the Taiyin manifests, the abdomen becomes full and distended, bowel movements are not smooth, there is a lack of appetite, and food induces vomiting, making it impossible to sleep. [Note: The occurrence of Taiyin results in abdominal fullness and distension, leading to issues with bowel movements. If the spleen cannot transport, the stomach will also not be harmonious, hence vomiting occurs and sleep is unattainable.]</p>
<p>When the condition of the Yangming manifests, there are symptoms resembling madness; the patient may want to run and shout, experience abdominal fullness preventing sleep, with a red and hot face, along with hallucinations and nonsensical speech. [Evidence: The symptoms of madness and shouting, along with nonsensical speech, indicate a problem with the Yangming pulse. The reversal of the vital energy leads to abdominal fullness. The stomach&#39;s disharmony results in the inability to sleep.]</p>
<p><strong>Essential Points on Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When winter acupuncture is applied at the spring equinox and the illness does not cease, a person may wish to sleep but cannot, and if they do manage to sleep, they experience visions. [Note: The spring season serves to release the energies stored during winter; when a person lies down, the energy returns to the yin and is then released, causing the inability to sleep. When the energy flows in Yang, the eyes open; when in Yin, the eyes close. When one perceives during sleep, the eyes are not fully closed.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of typhoid for two days, it affects the Yangming. Yangming governs the flesh, its pulse connects to the nasal network at the eyes, thus causing body heat, eye pain, and a dry nose, making sleep impossible. [Note: Body heat is due to the illness of Yangming energy. Although the illness resides in the energy, the Yangming pulse connects to the nasal network and eyes associated with the stomach, hence presenting symptoms of eye pain and nasal dryness. The stomach&#39;s disharmony results in the inability to sleep.]<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from water diseases, they cannot lie down; if they do, they are startled, and if startled, the cough becomes severe.  [Note: The water pathogens invade the stomach, hence they cannot lie down. When yang energy enters yin, yin and yang become imbalanced, leading to shock and fear. The metal element is afraid of fire heat, hence the severe cough.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Water Heat Points</strong></p>
<p>The kidney back-shu point at fifty-seven is where accumulated yin converges, and where water enters and exits. The five movements traverse the back above, thus it is the kidney back-shu. Therefore, for water diseases, there are swelling and a distended abdomen below, and wheezing and inability to lie down above; both the root and the branch are affected. The lung is responsible for wheezing, while the kidney is responsible for water swelling. When the lung is reversed, it prevents lying down, as it is where the water qi accumulates.  [Note: The five movements represent the attachment of water and yin, hence all relate to the kidney back-shu. Therefore, when water is affected, swelling and distention occur below, while wheezing and inability to lie down occur above; both root and branch are affected. The kidney is the root and the lung is the branch; in the lung it causes wheezing, in the kidney it causes water swelling. The lung has reversed qi, thus preventing lying down.]</p>
<p><strong>Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Distension</strong></p>
<p>Spleen distension is characterized by excessive belching, restlessness in the four limbs, a heavy body that cannot bear clothing, and inability to sleep peacefully.  [Note: The scholar Wu states: This is caused by the protective qi reversing within the city walls, leading to distension in the bowels.]<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Evil Guests</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao, saying: As for the guests of evil qi, sometimes they cause the eyes to be unclear and prevent sleep. What qi causes this? Bo Gao replied: When the five grains enter the stomach, their dregs and fluids combine to form three kinds of qi. Therefore, the ancestral qi accumulates in the chest, exits through the throat, and flows through the heart channels to facilitate breathing. The nourishing qi secretes its fluids, pours them into the channels, transforms them into blood, and nourishes the four limbs, while also supplying the five zang and six fu organs to meet the needs of the body. The protective qi, on the other hand, emerges from its fierce and rapid nature, advancing to the skin and flesh of the extremities without resting. By day, it moves in the yang; by night, it moves in the yin, constantly traversing the space between the lesser yin of the feet, circulating through the five zang and six fu organs. Now, when the adverse qi resides in the five zang and six fu organs, the protective qi merely guards the exterior, circulating in the yang without entering the yin. When it flows in the yang, the yang qi flourishes; when the yang qi flourishes, it causes the yang to descend, preventing entry into the yin. Because of the deficiency in yin, the eyes cannot close. </p>
<p>Note: The protective qi is characterized by its assertive and rapid movement, circulating outside the channels, moving in the yang by day and in the yin by night, governing the opening and closing of day and night. When it flows in the yang, the eyes open and are alert; when it flows in the yin, the eyes close and sleep. When the adverse qi resides in the five zang and six fu organs, the protective qi solely guards the outside, flows in the yang, and cannot enter the yin, hence the eyes do not close.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should it be treated? Bo Gao replied: Make up for what is lacking, drain what is excessive, adjust the void and the solid, so as to open the pathways and remove the邪. Drink a dose of Banxia decoction, and the Yin and Yang will be in harmony, allowing for both lying down and standing up. The Yellow Emperor said: Excellent. This is what is meant by clearing the blocked pathways, allowing the meridians to flow widely, and achieving harmony between Yin and Yang. I wish to hear the method! Bo Gao said: The recipe for the decoction is to use eight sheng of water from a thousand miles away, agitate it ten thousand times, take five sheng of the clear liquid, boil it with reeds as fuel, and when it boils, add one sheng of glutinous rice and five he of Banxia, cook slowly until it reduces to one and a half sheng, then strain out the dregs and drink a small cup of the juice three times a day, gradually increasing the amount according to one’s situation. Therefore, for a newly developed illness, when the cup is covered, one should lie down; when sweating occurs, then it is enough. For long-standing conditions, three doses are sufficient. </p>
<p>(Note: The activity of the Wei Qi in the Yin begins at the Yangming in the hands and feet, descending to the feet, and intersecting at the Shaoyin of the foot. From the Shaoyin, it flows into the five organs and six bowels; therefore, one should adjust the Qi of these two channels. To make up for the deficiency is to replenish the Wei Qi; to drain the excess is to release the excessive Jue Qi; adjusting the void and the solid refers to balancing the external and internal voids, so as to open the pathways and remove the counterflowing邪. Covering the cup and resting indicates that the righteous Qi is harmonized and the Jue Qi disperses, allowing the Wei Qi to enter and exit along its pathways.)<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>On Great Confusion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What force prevents one from lying down when ill? Qi Bo replied: The protective qi cannot enter the yin; it remains in the yang. When it remains in the yang, the yang qi becomes full. When the yang qi is full, the yang is exuberant. If it cannot enter the yin, then the yin qi becomes deficient, which is why the eyes cannot close. </p>
<p>(Note: The protective qi, when it exits the yang, causes the eyes to open and be awake; when it enters the yin, the eyes close and one sleeps. Therefore, if the protective qi stays in the yang, the yang is exuberant, and if it cannot enter the yin, the yin qi becomes deficient, hence the inability to close the eyes.)<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Golden Coffer Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)</strong>  </p>

<p>When the pulse on the right hand at the Guan position is strong in Yin, it corresponds to the Foot Taiyin Meridian. The patient suffers from cold in the feet and heat in the shins, abdominal bloating, and is troubled and unable to lie down, which is termed heat due to spleen excess. </p>
<p>When the pulse on the right hand at the Guan position is weak in Yin, it also corresponds to the Foot Taiyin Meridian. The patient suffers from diarrhea, abdominal fullness with ascending Qi, cholera-like vomiting, yellowish, vexed heart, unable to lie down, with rumbling in the intestines, which is called cold due to spleen weakness. </p>
<p>When both Yin and Yang pulses are strong at the left hand&#39;s Cun and Yin positions, it indicates that both the Hand Shaoyin and the Great Yang Meridians are strong. The patient suffers from headache, body heat, difficult bowel movements, and fullness in the heart and abdomen, unable to lie down, due to stagnant stomach Qi and undigested food, termed as both the heart and small intestine being simultaneously excessive. </p>

<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Question: After two or three days of cold damage, with body heat, eye pain, dry nose, inability to sleep, and a long pulse, what does this mean? Answer: This indicates that the foot Yangming stomach channel is afflicted. After two days of cold damage, if the Yangming channel is affected, it can be treated through sweating, although this is not the proper form of Yangming. Presently saying that in one or two days the Yangming channel is transmitted, with body heat, eye pain, dry nose, and inability to sleep, and a long pulse, this reflects issues with both Taiyang and Yangming, which can be addressed through exterior treatment.</p>
<p>Question: I do not want to sleep. Answer: For Taiyang syndrome, sweating should be induced. If there is profuse sweating, the stomach is dry, leading to agitation and inability to sleep, if the person desires to drink water, they should be given small amounts. Once the stomach is harmonized, recovery occurs. If the pulse is floating and urination is difficult with thirst, Wuling Powder should be administered. After purging, if sweating resumes, and there is daytime agitation but nighttime calmness, without nausea and thirst, and the pulse is deep and weak, with no high fever, Ginger and Aconite Decoction should be used. If after sweating, vomiting, or purging, there is restlessness and inability to sleep, with severe agitation leading to reversal of mental state and discomfort, Gardenia and Soybean Decoction should be the remedy. For severe heat and dry retching from cold damage, with moaning and incoherent speech, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction should be utilized. If after vomiting and purging, there is anxiety and fatigue, being unable to sleep day and night, Sour Jujube Decoction is indicated. For lesser Yin disorders persisting for two or three days, characterized by restlessness and insomnia, Huanglian and Ejiao Decoction should be the choice. If there is diarrhea and thirst with insomnia in lesser Yin disorders, Zhu Ling Decoction is the remedy. Another question: Why is there insomnia after cold damage? It is due to the heat mingling with the Yang forces, while the Yin energy has not yet recovered, thus the patient still cannot sleep after the illness. Gardenia and Wumei Decoction should be used.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For those who feel anxious and troubled repeatedly, unable to sleep, it is due to internal heat and obstruction of qi that cannot be released. If there is fullness and pain in the chest, or slight sweating with restlessness, Zhi Zi Decoction is indicated. If there is qi deficiency, add one penny of licorice. If there is vomiting or if pills were mistakenly taken, add half an ounce of fresh ginger. For those who feel anxious and weak, Liang Ge Powder is very effective, and it is also advisable to wash hands and feet with soothing decoctions to help resolve internal heat and ease the mind. </p>
<p>For restlessness along with abdominal fullness, Zhi Zi and Hou Po Decoction is indicated. If there is heat and anxiety after purging in Yangming disease, San Yi Cheng Qi Decoction is appropriate. If one is restless and unable to sleep after sweating, Wu Ling Powder or Liang Ge Powder should be used. If the mouth is dry and there is incoherent speech accompanied by insomnia, Wu Ling Decoction or Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction is recommended. For those feeling anxious, Liang Ge Powder is beneficial. In cases of Shaoyang syndrome with chest discomfort but without vomiting, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus Ban Xia and with Ren Shen and fresh loquat fruit is recommended.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p>
<h3>Eastern Garden Ten Treatises by Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Treatment Principles</h4>
<p>Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction with Chaihu is used to treat those who cannot lie down and experience frequent fright, indicating that the pathology is in the Shaoyang and Jueyin meridians. Those with water diseases thus cannot lie down; if they do, they become alarmed, leading to intense coughing. According to the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; Banxia Decoction is used for those who cannot lie down, as it eliminates the need for drink.</p>
<h3>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment by Dai Sigong (Ming Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Differentiating Between Deficiency and Excess</h4>
<p>Insomnia can be categorized into two types: one resulting from post-illness weakness or the elderly with diminished yang; the other is due to phlegm in the Gallbladder channel, causing the spirit not to return home, which also leads to insomnia. For the deficient type, use the Six Gentleman Decoction with half a coin of roasted sour jujube seeds and roasted astragalus. For the phlegm type, the Wending Decoction should be modified by reducing the bamboo shavings by half and adding Nanshen and roasted sour jujube seeds, both half a coin&#39;s worth, then take Qingling Dan. For symptoms of fright, palpitations, fright, forgetfulness, and mania, Wending Decoction can also be applied, or combined with Jin Yin Decoction plus bamboo shavings, adjusted according to cold, heat, deficiency, or excess. Adding Stone Calamus to the phlegm-purging decoction is particularly effective. </p>
<p>In general, symptoms of fright, forgetfulness, palpitations, loss of will, and insomnia due to heart wind are all caused by gallbladder phlegm saturating the heart, leading to insufficient heart qi. If cooling heart medications are overused, then heart fire may weaken further and phlegm may increase, not alleviating the illness. The primary principle should focus on managing phlegm and qi.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine by Li Zhan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For those who are troubled all night or who cannot sleep day or night, without having sweated or purged, and if it is an initial symptom of Yangming, use the Ge Gen Jie Ji Decoction. If the inner disturbance is due to a muddled heart and spirit, use the Qi Decoction. For those who cannot sleep after sweating, with dehydrated fluids, excessive heat, and Yin deficiency, causing disharmony in the stomach; if the Taiyang has sweated too much and they cannot sleep due to restlessness, desiring to drink water, they will recover. If the pulse is floating and they are thirsty with difficulty urinating, use the Wu Ling Powder. After sweating, vomiting, and purging, if there is regret and sleeplessness, use the Zhi Zhi Decoction. For those who cannot sleep day or night, use the Suan Zao Ren Decoction. For incoherent speech and dry heaving preventing sleep, use the Jie Du Decoction. For delirium, frequent urination, restlessness, and little sleep, use the Bai Hu Decoction with San Zhi; if accompanied by blood stasis, use the Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction. </p>
<p>In Shaoyin syndrome with diarrhea and thirst, or if they cannot sleep after diarrhea, use the Zhu Ling Decoction. If there is restlessness and insomnia for two or three days in Shaoyin, use the Huang Lian Ji Zi Decoction. After diarrhea with Yang deficiency and a sinking pulse, with no exterior symptoms, quiet at night but restless during the day, cannot sleep; use the Gu Jiang Fu Decoction, or Si Ni Decoction with Fu Ling. If there is much sweating, use the Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction. For insomnia after recovery from a cold, it indicates that Yin energy has not yet restored, use the Zhi Zi Wu Mei Decoction, or the Wen Dan Decoction with Zhu Ru. For those who are deficient, use the Shi Wei Wen Dan Decoction. For those appearing disoriented, use the Zhu Que Pill. According to the ancient method: for insomnia, use the Dan Shu Suan Zao Powder. For excessive sleep, the Sheng Suan Zao Powder is also beneficial.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and the detailed studies of previous philosophers, it is understood that the reasons for insomnia can be categorized into five: </p>
<ol>
<li>Qi deficiency: For this, one can use Six Gentleman Decoction, adding sour jujube seed and astragalus.</li>
<li>Yin deficiency: Accompanied by insufficient blood and irritable heart, use one tael of sour jujube seed, five qian of raw rehmannia, and two sheng of rice to cook congee for consumption.</li>
<li>Phlegm stagnation: Use Warm Gallbladder Decoction, adding rhizome of nux vomica, sour jujube seed, and powdered realgar.</li>
<li>Water retention: For mild cases, add calamus, polygala, and atractylodes to Six Gentleman Decoction; for severe cases, use Saliva Suppressing Pill.</li>
<li>Stomach discord: Ingredients include tangerine peel, licorice, dendrobium, poria, pinellia, medicinal dried yeast, and hawthorn.</li>

<p>Although these five categories exist, the intricacies of deficiency and excess, cold and heat vary and interrelate.

<p>When yang is excessive and yin is deficient, one cannot sleep day or night. This is because the night is dominated by yin; when yin is strong, one can close their eyes and sleep peacefully. If yin is overcome by yang, then one will be disturbed and unable to sleep all night. This is what is meant by &quot;yin deficiency causing restless nights.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is sweating and a dry nose, and one cannot sleep, this indicates that the pathogen is on the surface. If there is dry stool in the stomach, accompanied by excessive heat and agitation, leading to profuse sweating, and the fluids in the stomach are depleted causing sleeplessness, then the pathogen is located internally. When the stomach is unwell, one cannot rest; therefore, it is appropriate to disperse heat and harmonize the stomach. </p>
<p>If there is sweating, vomiting, or purging that leads to restlessness and inability to sleep, then one should use Gardenia and Soybean Decoction to promote the expulsion of internal heat. </p>
<p>In cases of Shaoyin disease, where there is internal heat and restlessness preventing sleep, it is also advisable to support yin and disperse heat. If one cannot sleep after recovery, it indicates that heat and various yang factors are combined and yin has not yet been restored. If there is excessive sweating and a severe deficiency of yang leading to sleeplessness, if there are no heat symptoms, Ginger and Aconite Decoction should be used to restore yin and revive yang. This is also an important point to understand.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Medical Regulations on Febrile Diseases</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods for Febrile Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>In Shaoyin disease, the pulse is weak, deep, and thin; the patient only desires to lie down and sweats without distress. They feel a wish to vomit. After five to six days, there are bowel movements; if they become agitated and cannot sleep, it leads to death. In cases of febrile disease, it is crucial not to see the Yin pulse, hence Zhongjing says that with Shaoyin disease, if the pulse is deep, it must be urgently warmed. Now, if the pulse is weak, deep, and thin, along with visible external symptoms, a desire to lie down, and sweating without distress, it indicates that Yang is no longer functioning; the desire to vomit shows an invasion by Yin evil; if they further have bowel movements, it means the organ&#39;s energy must be utterly exhausted. Moreover, initially, they were not distressed, but now they are agitated; they initially desired to sleep, but now cannot rest. With only a thread of Yang remaining and such turmoil, can it still be restored? After bowel movements, if there is sweating and the pulse is weak and deep, and the body is not greatly warm, use the Ginger and Aconite Decoction as a rescue method.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The condition manifests with restlessness during the day, making it impossible to sleep, while at night there is tranquility, with no nausea or thirst, and no external symptoms. The pulse is deep and faint, and the body does not exhibit severe heat. This condition, mentioned earlier, recurs after sweating and is characterized by a faint pulse and chills, which is due to both internal and external deficiency. Mistaking sweating for a loss of yang and misusing purgatives can lead to a loss of yin, hence it is said that both inner and outer are deficient. However, there is no need to elaborate on the prescriptions, as using aconite to revive yang and ginseng to nourish yin is already established practice. This serves as a teaching about the subtle essence, illustrating that the signs of lost yang are significantly more pronounced than those of lost yin. Yang is active during the day, causing heat and restlessness that hinders sleep, whereas yin is active at night, bringing peace without nausea or thirst. Can aconite and ginseng be evenly applied to both yin and yang? It is essential to use dried ginger and aconite, which are more specifically warming, to adequately revive yang and ensure harmony against the stronger yin.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Insomnia</strong></p>
<p>Insomnia, though varying with different illnesses, can be fully understood through the concepts of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot; Insomnia is rooted in the yin principle, with the spirit as its master; when the spirit is settled, sleep follows, but when the spirit is unsettled, sleep does not occur. The disturbances causing this unsettlement arise either from external pathogenic influences or from a deficiency in nourishing energy. When there are pathogenic factors, the symptoms are predominantly substantive; when there are none, they are entirely illusory. For instance, insomnia caused by illnesses like cold, flu, or malaria is due to external pathogenic invasion. In contrast, insomnia caused by phlegm, fire, cold, or water, as well as from issues related to diet, anger, or anxiety, stems from internal stagnation and reversal. Outside of these conditions, insomnia due to overthinking, fatigue, fright, and doubt, or chronic insomnia without apparent burden, is generally attributed to a deficiency in true yin essence and blood, resulting in a failure of Yin and Yang to interact and causing the spirit to remain unsettled in its abode. Understanding these two aspects allows one to know how to treat the condition. Drinking strong tea or having matters weighing on one’s mind can also prevent sleep due to the depletion of heart energy.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The heart conceals the spirit, serving as the residence of yang energy; it guards the principal energy and controls the transformation of yang. Generally, when the guarding energy enters the yin, it becomes still; in stillness, sleep occurs, as the yang naturally finds its return, leading to the spirit feeling secure and at rest. However, strong tea, due to its yin and cold nature, greatly suppresses the original yang. When yang is restrained by yin, the spirit feels restless, which is why one cannot sleep. Furthermore, when the heart is disturbed by affairs, the spirit moves; if the spirit moves, it cannot be still, which is also why one cannot sleep. Therefore, to seek sleep, one should nourish the yang within the yin and eliminate movement from stillness to obtain it.</p>
<p>When one takes medicine and immediately falls asleep, this is an indication of the effectiveness of the treatment. If the evil energy resides in the spirit&#39;s chamber, sleep will certainly be uneasy. However, if the medicine is appropriate, upon ingesting even a small amount, many evils will dissipate, and the intruders will leave, allowing the people to achieve peace. This mechanism of treatment and disorder can be discerned in an instant, and the effectiveness of the medicine can be known from this. Those who mismanage their treatment and recklessly use remedies only contribute to chaos and cruelty, which will surely lead to further annoyance and discomfort. The wise will see the signs and should use this knowledge to anticipate outcomes.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>Those who are unwell and unable to sleep must be deficient in vital energy. The essence governs blood; if blood is deficient, there is no way to nurture the heart. If the heart is deficient, the spirit cannot reside properly, which may lead to restlessness, fear, attachment, or baseless excessive thoughts, causing sleeplessness throughout the night, or alternating between sleep and wakefulness, resulting in an unsettled spirit. For these symptoms, the main treatment should focus on nourishing both essence and energy. </p>
<p>If overthinking and fatigue damage the heart and spleen, resulting in energy deficiency and a sinking of essence, leading to palpitations and insomnia, it is advisable to use Shoupi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction. </p>
<p>If emotional distress injures the inner organs, depleting blood and energy—whether fear injures the kidneys or fright damages the gallbladder, causing the spirit to lose its anchor and lead to insomnia—one should use Wufu Drink, Qifu Drink, or Sanyin Decoction, or Wujunzi Decoction, choosing as appropriate.</p>
<p>If both nutritive and defensive energies are impaired, blood and energy are severely damaged, and the spirit lacks a guiding force, resulting in insomnia day and night, one must utilize the Great Nourishing Yuan Decoction with modifications for treatment.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If fatigue and worry injure the heart and spleen, leading to insufficient vital energy, where clear yang does not rise, and if external pathogens do not resolve, resulting in cold and heat causing insomnia, one should take the Gui Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If overthinking causes a deficiency of the heart leading to insomnia, accompanied by slight irritability, then the Yang Xin Decoction or the Suan Zao Ren Decoction may be used. If excessive worry exhausts the heart&#39;s blood and stirs the heart fire, leading to irritability, thirst, and insomnia, the Tian Wang Bu Xin Decoction should be used. If there is heart deficiency with excessive fire, internal restlessness, and insomnia from anxiety, An Shen Pill is indicated. If there is exhaustion of essence and blood, combined with phlegm and qi accumulation, leading to anxiety and restless nights, the Secret Formula Suan Zao Ren Decoction should be used. For those with phlegm excess, the Shi Wei Wen Dan Decoction is recommended. </p>
<p>In general, if a person experiences excessive fatigue and worry, it will surely lead to the consumption of blood and the spirit being unanchored, thus causing insomnia. Even if there is slight phlegm or fire, there is no need for concern; it is essential to nourish qi and blood. When blood and qi are abundant, various symptoms will naturally subside. However, if various issues are treated simultaneously and inappropriately, it may lead to complications and difficulty in recovery, eventually resulting in the depletion of the original spirit, making it irretrievable.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>When there is evil present but one cannot sleep, removing the evil will allow the spirit to find peace. Thus, for treating the evils of wind and cold, dispersing them is essential, as with concoctions like Chai Hu Decoction and those containing Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Zi Su, and Gan Ge. For the evil of heat, cooling treatments are necessary, such as Zhu Ru and Shi Gao Decoction along with herbs like Qian, Lian, Zhi, and Bo. For the phlegm and fluid evils, one should transform phlegm, as with Warm Gallbladder Decoction, Liu An Decoction, and Daotan Wan. For the evils of food stagnation, one should dissolve the obstruction, as in Da He Zhong Decoction and Ping Wei San. For the evils of water and dampness, one should promote urination and drainage, as with Wu Ling San, Wu Pi San, or adding Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan. For the evils of reversed qi, moving qi is advisable, as in Pai Qi Decoction and Si Mo Decoction. For the evils of cold yin, warming the center is necessary, as with Li Yin Decoction and Li Zhong Tang. These examples are just a general overview; one should still seek specific methods for treatment in each category.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>Xu Donggao said: There are those who cannot sleep due to phlegm-fire disturbance, causing unrest in the heart and spirit, excessive thoughts and worries, and a fiery phlegm accumulation. There are also those who cannot sleep because of insufficient kidney water, where the true yin does not rise, leading to an excessive heart fire. Additionally, some experience spleen fatigue with stagnant fire, unable to disperse, which causes restlessness in the early morning as the qi rises. For these conditions, methods to invigorate the spleen, resolve stagnation, clear phlegm, and descend fire should be employed. </p>
<p>Those with a strong constitution who occasionally suffer from phlegm-fire leading to insomnia should first use rolling phlegm pills, followed by calming the spirit pills, or similar remedies to clear the heart and cool the stomach. Conversely, those with a weak constitution, whether due to overexertion or after an illness, represent a state of deficiency. They should use blood-nourishing and calming medicines.</p>
<p>Generally, those who cannot sleep after an illness or postpartum women suffer from deficient blood and qi, as well as insufficient heart and spleen organs. Even if phlegm-fire is present, it is not advisable to treat it too aggressively; instead, supportive nourishment should take precedence, potentially supplemented with medicines to clear phlegm and descend fire. For those whose insomnia is not attributed to illness, phlegm-fire should be addressed, but still supplemented with blood-nourishing and deficiency-replenishing remedies for a proper approach. </p>
<p>—Secret Teachings of the Stone Chamber [Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo]<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>When a person suffers from a frightened heart and restlessness, or is unable to sleep at night, it is often thought to be a heart ailment. However, it is not a heart issue but a kidney problem. To calm the mind, one should treat the kidneys. The prescription includes three taels each of ginseng, cooked rehmannia, shan za (sour jujube), angelica, sweetflag, ophiopogon, poria, and fu shen; two taels of ziziphus, and one tael each of jujube seed and white mustard seeds; and five qian each of coptis, cinnamon, and amomum. Grind these ingredients into a powder, form into pills with honey, and take five qian daily, either with wine or soup. This formula treats insomnia. It suffices to use ginseng, poria, angelica, and ophiopogon. If the insomnia arises from fire, adding coptis is adequate. Why then use cooked rehmannia and shan za, which nourish the kidneys, adding cinnamon to stimulate heat? It is misunderstood that insomnia is simply a heart issue; it is actually that the heart qi does not return to the kidneys. By using cooked rehmannia and shan za to nourish the kidneys, the kidney qi becomes rooted and naturally connects to the heart. The addition of cinnamon to warm the life gate enables the kidney qi to be warm, allowing the ministerial fire to have control, thus causing the heart qi to descend. The sovereign and minister harmonize, bringing unity of mind and intention.</p>
<p>When a person cannot rest their head comfortably while lying down, the prescription is five taels of ginseng, two taels each of zizi and roasted jujube seed, eight taels of cooked rehmannia, four taels of shan za, one tael of biota seed, three taels each of ophiopogon and fu shen, and five qian of dried tangerine peel, all ground into a powder and made into pills with honey, taking one tael daily with boiling water. In five days, one finds peace, and full recovery occurs.

<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: In hot illnesses where sweat does not emerge, accompanied by nosebleeds, dizziness leading to fainting, facial swelling, cold feet and legs, inability to lie down, shivering, aversion to wind and wooden sounds, sore throat, dental caries, aversion to wind, nasal obstruction, easy to startle—this is governed by the &quot;Sheng&quot;. In cases of fright leading to inability to sleep, easy to bite, water vapor moving up and down, and qi of the five organs moving chaotically—this is governed by the &quot;San Yin Jiao&quot;. Inability to lie down is governed by &quot;Fu Xie&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Cold in the gall causing inability to lie down—administer moxibustion at one fen of Qiao Yin to supplement it.</p>
<p>Clinical Cases</p>
<p>The &quot;Ru Men Shi Qin&quot; states: A woman overly worried could not sleep for two years, and no medicine could cure her. The physician noted a slow pulse in both wrists, indicating a spleen disorder since the spleen governs thought. He discussed it with her husband, provoking her with anger. The husband took her wealth and drank for several days, not using any remedy before leaving. She truly became furious, sweating, and that night she fell into a deep sleep, awakening after eight or nine days, with normal pulse when she woke and ate.</p>
<p>A woman who could not sleep from prolonged thinking, I feigned drunkenness and did not question her. The woman indeed became angry, and that night she fell into a deep sleep.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Overview&quot; states: In the second year of the Shaoxing period, there was a certain Mr. Dong who suffered from unsettled spirit energy. Whenever he lay down, his soul would rise and he felt as if his body was on the bed while his spirit had left his body. He experienced frequent fright and nightmares, and was unable to sleep throughout the night; previous treatments had been ineffective. Upon examining him, I inquired what illness the doctors had treated him for. Mr. Dong replied: &quot;Everyone thinks it&#39;s a heart illness.&quot; I said: &quot;From a pulse perspective, the liver meridian is afflicted by evil, it is not a heart illness.&quot; Due to the liver energy being weak, it is attacked by evil energy, and the liver houses the soul. When the soul wanders, it changes; a normal person’s liver does not succumb to evil—when they lie down, the soul returns to the liver, the spirit settles, and sleep is achieved. Now that there is evil in the liver, the soul cannot return, hence it flies away as if leaving the body. The liver governs anger, thus even slight anger is intense. Mr. Dong cheerfully said: &quot;I have never heard of this before. Even without taking medicine, I already feel that my deep illness has left my body.&quot; Subsequently, I wrote a prescription for him, and after a month of taking it, all his ailments were removed. The prescription used mother of pearl as the main ingredient, supplemented by dragon’s teeth. Mother of pearl enters the liver meridian as the primary remedy, and dragon’s teeth are similar to the liver. Dragon’s teeth and tiger’s eye are commonly regarded today as heart-soothing medicines. However, it should be noted that dragon’s teeth calm the soul while tiger’s eye stabilizes the spirit, each belonging to its own category. The eastern azure dragon represents wood, belongs to the liver, and houses the soul; the western white tiger represents metal, belongs to the lungs, and houses the spirit. The dragon can change, causing the soul to wander and be unsettled; the tiger can concentrate, leading the spirit to be still and secured. I suggest that for treating an unsettled spirit, one should use tiger’s eye; for a wandering soul, one should use dragon’s teeth. All things have their own principles and do not lose them; it is merely for humans to realize them.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>&quot;The Classic of Returning to Spring&quot; states: A young boy of fifteen suffered from excessive mental exertion, experiencing little sleep, fright, and coldness. Initially, he was treated with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, along with Poria, Sour Jujube, and Polygala, which gradually alleviated the chills. He was then given the modified Gui Pi Decoction, resulting in reduced panic and more peace. Finally, the Yang Xin Decoction was administered, leading to complete recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; mentions: A woman experienced discomfort while carrying a burden, abdominal bloating, little sleep, diminished appetite, and frequent menstruation. I noted that the spleen governs blood and controls saliva; her emotional distress harmed the spleen&#39;s ability to retain blood, contributing to excessive saliva. I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and the Ji Sheng Gui Pi Decoction, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; narrates the case of a man named Zhou Gong, over forty years of age, who developed a wasting illness due to the accumulation of work. He suffered from fatigue, reduced appetite, and frequent fears, coupled with insomnia lasting over six months. Interestingly, there was no thirst in the upper body, and he had no appetite for soups or water; when he did drink a little, it would be unabsorbed. However, he urinated two to three liters each night, with the urine appearing thick and turbid. He believed he was on the brink of death. Upon examining his pulse, it still felt weak, and he had not lost much weight, indicating that his stomach qi was still present. Therefore, I prescribed the Gui Pi Decoction, omitting the cypress and the Great Qi Supplementing Decoction, to nourish both yang and yin through alternating use. After administering over three hundred doses, including twenty pounds of ginseng, he fully recovered. This reflects the signs of spirit depletion above and essence depletion below.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　黄帝曰：人之多卧者，何气使然？岐伯曰：此人肠胃大而皮肤湿，而分肉不解焉。肠胃大则卫气留久，皮肤湿则分肉不解，其行迟。夫卫气者，昼日常行于阳，夜行于阴，故阳气尽则卧，阴气尽则寤。故肠胃大则卫气行留久，皮肤湿分肉不解则行迟。留于阴也久，其气不精则欲瞑，故多卧矣。其肠胃小，皮肤滑以缓，分肉解利，卫气之留于阳也久，故少瞑焉。　　 【注　卫气日行于阳，夜行于阴，阳气尽而入于阴则卧，阴气尽而出于阳则寤。如留于阴久则多卧，留于阳久则少瞑焉。】　　黄帝曰：其非常经也，卒然多卧者，何气使然？岐伯曰：邪气留于上焦，上焦闭而不通，已食若饮汤，卫气久留于阴而不行，故卒然多卧焉。　　【注　非常经者，非日行于阳夜行于阴之经常出入。此因邪气留于上焦则上焦闭而不通，饮食于胃则中焦满实，以致卫气久留于下之阴，而不能上行于阳，故卒然多卧也。】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　　　扁鹊难经</p>

<p><strong>Door of Desire for Sleep</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of liver heat disease, the urine is first yellow, abdominal pain leads to excessive lying down, body heat is present, and if heat contests, it causes manic speech and fright. There is fullness and pain in the flanks, and the limbs are restless and cannot find peace in sleep. If the condition is severe with the metal elements, there will be significant sweating. If the qi is rebellious, it leads to metal death. If the qi reverses, there will be headaches, and the pulse will rise to the head. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The liver governs the smooth flow of qi, hence the yellow urine. The liver meridian relates to the lower abdomen, thus causing abdominal pain. The liver stores the soul, and if the soul is disturbed, it leads to excessive lying down. Wood and fire govern qi, hence the body heat. This refers to internal causes of the illness. A contest of heat means the struggle between cold and heat, referring to external evils. Disturbance of the soul leads to manic speech. Liver disease causes fright, and since the liver meridian spreads through the flanks, this results in fullness and pain there. When lying down, blood returns to the liver; if liver qi is harmed, one cannot sleep. Rebellious qi indicates extreme heat reversing internally. If heat is excessive, it ascends to the head, hence headache and dizziness.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Syncope</strong></p>
<p>In cases of liver-yin syncope, there will be swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, difficulty urinating, a desire for excessive lying down, knee flexion, contraction and swelling of the yin, and internal heat in the thigh. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the foot meridian of the liver experiences syncope, it leads to swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, and difficulty in urination, along with contraction and swelling of the yin. The liver governs the tendons; the knee represents the convergence of tendons. When the meridians are reversed, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, leading to a desire to lie down and flex the knees. The liver yin of wood and fire governs qi; if the nourishing function is reversed, it causes internal swelling and heat in the thighs.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>In autumn, when the qi is sharp, and summer&#39;s heat lingers, if the illness persists, one will tend to sleep excessively.<br>[Note: The autumn qi affects the skin and the related channels from summer, causing qi to not circulate outward, thus leading to a desire for sleep.]</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on the Sea of Marrow</strong></p>
<p>When the Sea of Marrow is abundant, there is a lightness and strength, causing one to exceed their limits. When it is insufficient, there will be dizziness, buzzing in the ears, weakness in the shins, lack of sight, lethargy, and an inclination to rest.<br>[Note: According to Yao, essence and fluid nourish the brain&#39;s marrow and flow beneath to the yin aspects, thus when the Sea of Marrow is abundant, the legs are light and strong. The marrow rises from the cavities of the bones and connects upward to the brain; hence, abundance may lead to excess. When the Sea of Marrow is insufficient, essence is exhausted, which causes the ears to ring and vision to diminish. Lack of fluid causes issues in the bones, leading to weakness in the shins and lethargy.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Great Confusion Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What causes people to sleep excessively? Qi Bo replied: This is due to the large size of the person’s intestines and stomach, combined with dampness of the skin, which prevents the division of flesh. A large intestine and stomach cause the defensive qi to linger for long; damp skin prevents the division of flesh, leading to sluggish movement. The defensive qi circulates in the daytime in the yang phase and in the nighttime in the yin phase. Hence, when the yang qi is exhausted, one sleeps; when the yin qi is depleted, one wakes. Therefore, a large intestine and stomach cause the defensive qi to linger for long, and damp skin together with an inability to divide flesh results in sluggishness. When it stays in the yin for a long time, its qi becomes impure, leading to a desire for sleep, hence the excessive sleeping. When the intestines are small, the skin is soft and relaxed, and the division of flesh is efficient, the defensive qi lingers longer in the yang phase, resulting in less need to sleep. </p>
<p>[Note: The defensive qi circulates in the yang phase during the day and in the yin phase at night. When the yang qi is exhausted and enters the yin, one sleeps; when the yin qi is exhausted and exits the yang, one wakes. Thus, lingering too long in the yin leads to excessive sleeping, while lingering too long in the yang leads to less need for sleep.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What then causes sudden excessive sleeping? Qi Bo replied: Pathogenic qi lingers in the upper burner, obstructing it, making it unresponsive. When one eats as if drinking soup, the defensive qi lingers long in the yin and does not circulate, which leads to sudden excessive sleeping. </p>
<p>[Note: The term &quot;unusual channels&quot; refers to those which do not follow the normal pattern of circulating in the yang during the day and in the yin at night. This condition arises when pathogenic qi lingers in the upper burner, resulting in obstruction. When food fills the middle burner, it causes the defensive qi to remain in the lower yin for too long and unable to ascend to the yang, hence the sudden excessive sleeping.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Spleen Disease</strong></p>
<p>If one obtains the pulse of the spleen, the external symptoms are a yellowish face, propensity to belch, good at thinking and tasting; the internal symptoms are a sensation of movement around the navel, pressing down feels firm like pain; the illness manifests as abdominal distension, inability to digest food, heavy body with joint pain, laziness leading to excessive sleep, and limbs that are not retracted. If these symptoms are present, it is the spleen; if not, it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Jinkui Yaolüe</strong> 【Han - Zhang Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Just Wanting to Sleep</strong></p>
<p>The section on Fox Possession states: In patients, the pulse is rapid without heat, mildly restless, silently wanting to sleep, and sweating. In the initial three to four days, the eyes are red like a dove’s eyes. After seven to eight days, the corners of the eyes turn dark. If one can eat, pus has already formed, and a formula of red adzuki beans and angelica is recommended. The section on the Five Organs states: When the evil crying makes the soul unsettled, it indicates a deficiency of blood and Qi; a deficiency of blood and Qi pertains to the heart. If heart Qi is deficient, the person becomes fearful, closes their eyes wanting to sleep, dreams of distant journeys, and the spirit becomes scattered, leading the soul to wander aimlessly. A deficiency in Yin Qi leads to epilespy; a deficiency in Yang Qi leads to mania.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Four Signs of Excessive Sleep</strong></p>
<p>If a patient has a floating pulse in both wrists, experiences headache, body heat, often sweats, feels heavy, and breathes with wheezing while displaying no signs of energy but a desire to sleep, this is indicative of Wind-Heat syndrome. Wind-Heat should not be treated with sweating; it is advisable to use Wei Rui Decoction. If the patient has a floating pulse, dizziness, severe pain, and aversion to cold, this indicates a Wind-Cold syndrome. After ten days, if the pulse is floating, fine, and there is a desire for sleep, this suggests that the exterior has resolved. If there is fullness in the chest or pain in the side, administer Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the pulse is merely floating, Ma Huang Decoction should be used. If a patient has a sinking, fine pulse in both wrists and a strong desire to sleep, this indicates a Shaoyin syndrome; one should urgently prepare Si Ni Decoction to revive the Yang, without delay. If the symptoms resemble those of a cold, with heavy limbs and a sudden desire to sleep, it is important to examine the upper and lower lips. If there are sores on the upper lip, it indicates pestilence harming the internal organs; if there are sores on the lower lip, it indicates pestilence affecting the lower body, which should be treated as Huohuo disorder.</p>

<p><strong>Heat Injuring Qi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In the case of internal injuries, the Qi of the heart and lungs has already been severed from the exterior, leading to lethargy and a strong desire to sleep, with limbs feeling heavy and unresponsive. This is called Heat injuring Yuan Qi; the spleen governs the limbs. The classics say: Heat injures Qi. It is also said: Heat causes bones to waste and muscles to weaken.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Spleen and Stomach Deficiency Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are weak, there is laziness and a tendency to sleep, with limbs lacking strength. In the autumn dryness, damp heat is minimally reduced, leading to feelings of heaviness and joint pain, dry mouth and tongue, tasteless food, irregular bowel movements, frequent urination, a lack of appetite, and poor digestion. Additionally, signs of lung disease may appear, with chills and a feeling of melancholy. The complexion is poor and discordant, indicating a failure of yang energy to expand. Thus, one should promote yang and invigorate qi with the &quot;Ascending Yang and Nourishing Stomach Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In the case of a cold damage transforming into yin, excessive sleep occurs. When one is drowsy with closed eyes, it indicates that yin is dominant in closing. A silence without desire to speak signifies a predominance of yin in stillness. If there is a return of symptoms after clearing the exterior with a Yangming pathology involving fullness in the chest and pain in the flanks, accompanied by sweating and nasal dryness, one should use &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang.&quot; If the pulse is floating, consider &quot;Qiang Huo Chong He Tang,&quot; and in winter, &quot;Ma Huang Tang.&quot; If Yangming heat is lurking within and leads to excessive sleep, administer &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang.&quot; For a Shaoyin pulse that is deep and thin, with spontaneous diarrhea and a desire to vomit accompanied by thirst and drowsiness, &quot;Si Ni Tang&quot; should be enhanced with Ren Shen and Fu Ling to nourish yin and restore yang. Alternatively, if there is a febrile disease followed by sweating, and the pulse becomes deep, thin, and the body feels cold, initially quiet but gradually becoming drowsy with a desire to sleep without awareness, it is crucial to quickly administer &quot;Si Ni Tang&quot; to warm the limbs. Otherwise, there may be cases of deep sleep leading to death. In cases of lily syndrome where there is sweating upon closing the eyes, wind-heat conditions often do not improve. The spirit may become disoriented due to misfortune. Each condition should be treated according to its details. However, if sweating leads to a return of deep sleep, it indicates the restoration of the righteous qi, and no medication is necessary.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Typhoid Fever</strong></p>
<p>The protective qi of the body moves in the daytime with the yang and at night with the yin. In waking, it operates through yang; in sleeping, it operates through yin. When yang qi is deficient and yin qi is abundant, the eyes close, leading to excessive sleep, indicating that the pathogenic qi transmits to the yin rather than the yang. When in a daze with closed eyes, the yin naturally closes. When one is silent and speaks little, it signifies the dominance of yin which is associated with stillness. The text states: If a person with a taiyang disease has been ill for ten days and the pulse is floating and thin, and they have a tendency to sleep, it indicates that the exterior aspect is resolved. If the nose is dry and they sweat little while being prone to sleep, it suggests that pathogenic heat attacks from within, not from the surface, leading to an underlying heat that causes a preference for sleep. In cases of the three yang combined with illness, there is a strong desire to sleep; if the eyes close, there may be sweating and delirium, indicating the presence of heat. If there is night sweating, it reflects stomach heat and also a tendency for excessive sleep. Conditions like wind-warmth or fox-restrictions may present similar symptoms, and differentiation is necessary.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to a lesser yin disease, the pulse is weak, submerged, and fine, with the patient desiring to lie down. There is sweating without agitation, and a desire to vomit. If this persists for five or six days, and then there is diarrhea accompanied by restlessness and inability to sleep, it indicates a fatal condition. Cold damage with a weak, submerged pulse clearly signifies a yin condition, especially since the patient wishes to lie still and not move. Sweating has already occurred, showing there is no yang condition internally. If the heart is not agitated and there is a continual desire to vomit, this indicates that the yang pathogen has dispersed and the yin pathogen is causing trouble, thus it is urgent to expel the cold. If there is a failure to warm the body, for five or six days the diarrhea will result in chaos in both the upper and lower regions. If the patient does not exhibit restlessness, the true yang in the kidneys has not dispersed. However, with added restlessness and inability to sleep, this is a clear sign of an uncontrollable state that surely leads to death. The previous mismanagement caused this condition, rather than it being inherently incurable. I possess an extraordinary remedy, called &quot;Turning Yang to Rescue.&quot; It involves using one tael each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and roasted jujube seeds, along with five qian of poria and two qian of cinnamon, boiled together in water. This single dose can calm the patient and restore health. This remedy employs ginseng to revive the exhausted, white atractylodes and poria to eliminate water dampness causing diarrhea, cinnamon to warm the center and dispel cold, and jujube seeds to calm the mind and relieve restlessness. When used appropriately, its effects will surely be as remarkable as before.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Huangdi Neijing - Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Illness</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: Why is it that some people cannot lie down in peace? Qibo replied: It is because the organ is injured, and when the essence is properly settled, peace is achieved. When the essence is deficient, one cannot find comfort. The &quot;Taisu&quot; volume 30 states, &quot;When the essence is lacking, one cannot find peace in lying down.&quot; In volume 12 of &quot;Jiayi,&quot; it states, &quot;When emotions lean on something, one cannot lie down in peace.&quot; Thus, people cannot easily ascertain their illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The essence produced by the stomach can settle within the five organs, bringing peace. If it is retained in the stomach, it leads to restlessness. If there is obstruction, it results in abscesses, hence people cannot easily identify their ailments.]</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Why is it that people cannot recline? Qibo answered: The lung is the cover of the organs; when lung qi is abundant, the pulse becomes large. A large pulse makes it impossible to recline. This is discussed within the balance of yin and yang.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The lung influences the hundred vessels and transports essence to the organs; when lung qi is rebellious, it becomes strong, leading to a large pulse. A large pulse then prevents one from lying down.]</strong><a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Reverse Theory</h3>
<p>If the vital energy cannot lie down to rest and makes a sound, this reflects the reverse of Yangming. The three Yang meridians are meant to flow downward, but now they reverse and ascend, hence the sound during rest. Yangming refers to the stomach channel, which is the sea of the six fu organs, and its energy also flows downward. When Yangming is reversed and cannot follow its proper path, one cannot lie down. The &quot;Lower Classic&quot; states: if the stomach is not harmonious, one cannot rest peacefully; this is what it refers to.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Yangming stomach channel is the sea of the five zang and six fu organs. The blood and energy it produces ascend to the lungs through the great collateral and descend to the foot&#39;s lesser yin through the stomach channel. If Yangming reverses and cannot follow its path, one cannot lie down, hence there is sound during rest. The fluids of Yangming descend to the kidneys with the energy; if Yangming reverses and cannot follow its path, the water and energy of the kidneys may ascend and disrupt Yangming, resulting in disharmony of the stomach and inability to rest peacefully.</p>
<p>Now, if one cannot lie down and experiences wheezing, this indicates the presence of water energy. Water flows along the paths of fluids, and the kidneys are the water organ, governing fluids, rest, and wheezing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Yangming reverses and does not follow its path downward into the kidneys, then the waters and energies of the kidneys may flow upwards along the pathways of fluids to enter the stomach, causing disharmony of the stomach and inability to rest peacefully. Therefore, the kidneys are the water organ, responsible for storing fluids, and also regulate rest and wheezing.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Critique of Conditions</strong></p>
<p>When the condition of the Taiyin manifests, the abdomen becomes full and distended, bowel movements are not smooth, there is a lack of appetite, and food induces vomiting, making it impossible to sleep. [Note: The occurrence of Taiyin results in abdominal fullness and distension, leading to issues with bowel movements. If the spleen cannot transport, the stomach will also not be harmonious, hence vomiting occurs and sleep is unattainable.]</p>
<p>When the condition of the Yangming manifests, there are symptoms resembling madness; the patient may want to run and shout, experience abdominal fullness preventing sleep, with a red and hot face, along with hallucinations and nonsensical speech. [Evidence: The symptoms of madness and shouting, along with nonsensical speech, indicate a problem with the Yangming pulse. The reversal of the vital energy leads to abdominal fullness. The stomach&#39;s disharmony results in the inability to sleep.]</p>
<p><strong>Essential Points on Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When winter acupuncture is applied at the spring equinox and the illness does not cease, a person may wish to sleep but cannot, and if they do manage to sleep, they experience visions. [Note: The spring season serves to release the energies stored during winter; when a person lies down, the energy returns to the yin and is then released, causing the inability to sleep. When the energy flows in Yang, the eyes open; when in Yin, the eyes close. When one perceives during sleep, the eyes are not fully closed.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of typhoid for two days, it affects the Yangming. Yangming governs the flesh, its pulse connects to the nasal network at the eyes, thus causing body heat, eye pain, and a dry nose, making sleep impossible. [Note: Body heat is due to the illness of Yangming energy. Although the illness resides in the energy, the Yangming pulse connects to the nasal network and eyes associated with the stomach, hence presenting symptoms of eye pain and nasal dryness. The stomach&#39;s disharmony results in the inability to sleep.]<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from water diseases, they cannot lie down; if they do, they are startled, and if startled, the cough becomes severe.  [Note: The water pathogens invade the stomach, hence they cannot lie down. When yang energy enters yin, yin and yang become imbalanced, leading to shock and fear. The metal element is afraid of fire heat, hence the severe cough.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Water Heat Points</strong></p>
<p>The kidney back-shu point at fifty-seven is where accumulated yin converges, and where water enters and exits. The five movements traverse the back above, thus it is the kidney back-shu. Therefore, for water diseases, there are swelling and a distended abdomen below, and wheezing and inability to lie down above; both the root and the branch are affected. The lung is responsible for wheezing, while the kidney is responsible for water swelling. When the lung is reversed, it prevents lying down, as it is where the water qi accumulates.  [Note: The five movements represent the attachment of water and yin, hence all relate to the kidney back-shu. Therefore, when water is affected, swelling and distention occur below, while wheezing and inability to lie down occur above; both root and branch are affected. The kidney is the root and the lung is the branch; in the lung it causes wheezing, in the kidney it causes water swelling. The lung has reversed qi, thus preventing lying down.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on Evil Guests</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao, saying: As for the guests of evil qi, sometimes they cause the eyes to be unclear and prevent sleep. What qi causes this? Bo Gao replied: When the five grains enter the stomach, their dregs and fluids combine to form three kinds of qi. Therefore, the ancestral qi accumulates in the chest, exits through the throat, and flows through the heart channels to facilitate breathing. The nourishing qi secretes its fluids, pours them into the channels, transforms them into blood, and nourishes the four limbs, while also supplying the five zang and six fu organs to meet the needs of the body. The protective qi, on the other hand, emerges from its fierce and rapid nature, advancing to the skin and flesh of the extremities without resting. By day, it moves in the yang; by night, it moves in the yin, constantly traversing the space between the lesser yin of the feet, circulating through the five zang and six fu organs. Now, when the adverse qi resides in the five zang and six fu organs, the protective qi merely guards the exterior, circulating in the yang without entering the yin. When it flows in the yang, the yang qi flourishes; when the yang qi flourishes, it causes the yang to descend, preventing entry into the yin. Because of the deficiency in yin, the eyes cannot close. </p>
<p>Note: The protective qi is characterized by its assertive and rapid movement, circulating outside the channels, moving in the yang by day and in the yin by night, governing the opening and closing of day and night. When it flows in the yang, the eyes open and are alert; when it flows in the yin, the eyes close and sleep. When the adverse qi resides in the five zang and six fu organs, the protective qi solely guards the outside, flows in the yang, and cannot enter the yin, hence the eyes do not close.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should it be treated? Bo Gao replied: Make up for what is lacking, drain what is excessive, adjust the void and the solid, so as to open the pathways and remove the邪. Drink a dose of Banxia decoction, and the Yin and Yang will be in harmony, allowing for both lying down and standing up. The Yellow Emperor said: Excellent. This is what is meant by clearing the blocked pathways, allowing the meridians to flow widely, and achieving harmony between Yin and Yang. I wish to hear the method! Bo Gao said: The recipe for the decoction is to use eight sheng of water from a thousand miles away, agitate it ten thousand times, take five sheng of the clear liquid, boil it with reeds as fuel, and when it boils, add one sheng of glutinous rice and five he of Banxia, cook slowly until it reduces to one and a half sheng, then strain out the dregs and drink a small cup of the juice three times a day, gradually increasing the amount according to one’s situation. Therefore, for a newly developed illness, when the cup is covered, one should lie down; when sweating occurs, then it is enough. For long-standing conditions, three doses are sufficient. </p>
<p>(Note: The activity of the Wei Qi in the Yin begins at the Yangming in the hands and feet, descending to the feet, and intersecting at the Shaoyin of the foot. From the Shaoyin, it flows into the five organs and six bowels; therefore, one should adjust the Qi of these two channels. To make up for the deficiency is to replenish the Wei Qi; to drain the excess is to release the excessive Jue Qi; adjusting the void and the solid refers to balancing the external and internal voids, so as to open the pathways and remove the counterflowing邪. Covering the cup and resting indicates that the righteous Qi is harmonized and the Jue Qi disperses, allowing the Wei Qi to enter and exit along its pathways.)<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Question: After two or three days of cold damage, with body heat, eye pain, dry nose, inability to sleep, and a long pulse, what does this mean? Answer: This indicates that the foot Yangming stomach channel is afflicted. After two days of cold damage, if the Yangming channel is affected, it can be treated through sweating, although this is not the proper form of Yangming. Presently saying that in one or two days the Yangming channel is transmitted, with body heat, eye pain, dry nose, and inability to sleep, and a long pulse, this reflects issues with both Taiyang and Yangming, which can be addressed through exterior treatment.</p>
<p>Question: I do not want to sleep. Answer: For Taiyang syndrome, sweating should be induced. If there is profuse sweating, the stomach is dry, leading to agitation and inability to sleep, if the person desires to drink water, they should be given small amounts. Once the stomach is harmonized, recovery occurs. If the pulse is floating and urination is difficult with thirst, Wuling Powder should be administered. After purging, if sweating resumes, and there is daytime agitation but nighttime calmness, without nausea and thirst, and the pulse is deep and weak, with no high fever, Ginger and Aconite Decoction should be used. If after sweating, vomiting, or purging, there is restlessness and inability to sleep, with severe agitation leading to reversal of mental state and discomfort, Gardenia and Soybean Decoction should be the remedy. For severe heat and dry retching from cold damage, with moaning and incoherent speech, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction should be utilized. If after vomiting and purging, there is anxiety and fatigue, being unable to sleep day and night, Sour Jujube Decoction is indicated. For lesser Yin disorders persisting for two or three days, characterized by restlessness and insomnia, Huanglian and Ejiao Decoction should be the choice. If there is diarrhea and thirst with insomnia in lesser Yin disorders, Zhu Ling Decoction is the remedy. Another question: Why is there insomnia after cold damage? It is due to the heat mingling with the Yang forces, while the Yin energy has not yet recovered, thus the patient still cannot sleep after the illness. Gardenia and Wumei Decoction should be used.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Eastern Garden Ten Treatises by Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Treatment Principles</h4>
<p>Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction with Chaihu is used to treat those who cannot lie down and experience frequent fright, indicating that the pathology is in the Shaoyang and Jueyin meridians. Those with water diseases thus cannot lie down; if they do, they become alarmed, leading to intense coughing. According to the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; Banxia Decoction is used for those who cannot lie down, as it eliminates the need for drink.</p>
<h3>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment by Dai Sigong (Ming Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Differentiating Between Deficiency and Excess</h4>
<p>Insomnia can be categorized into two types: one resulting from post-illness weakness or the elderly with diminished yang; the other is due to phlegm in the Gallbladder channel, causing the spirit not to return home, which also leads to insomnia. For the deficient type, use the Six Gentleman Decoction with half a coin of roasted sour jujube seeds and roasted astragalus. For the phlegm type, the Wending Decoction should be modified by reducing the bamboo shavings by half and adding Nanshen and roasted sour jujube seeds, both half a coin&#39;s worth, then take Qingling Dan. For symptoms of fright, palpitations, fright, forgetfulness, and mania, Wending Decoction can also be applied, or combined with Jin Yin Decoction plus bamboo shavings, adjusted according to cold, heat, deficiency, or excess. Adding Stone Calamus to the phlegm-purging decoction is particularly effective. </p>
<p>In general, symptoms of fright, forgetfulness, palpitations, loss of will, and insomnia due to heart wind are all caused by gallbladder phlegm saturating the heart, leading to insufficient heart qi. If cooling heart medications are overused, then heart fire may weaken further and phlegm may increase, not alleviating the illness. The primary principle should focus on managing phlegm and qi.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

If the inner disturbance is due to a muddled heart and spirit, use the Qi Decoction. For those who cannot sleep after sweating, with dehydrated fluids, excessive heat, and Yin deficiency, causing disharmony in the stomach; if the Taiyang has sweated too much and they cannot sleep due to restlessness, desiring to drink water, they will recover. If the pulse is floating and they are thirsty with difficulty urinating, use the Wu Ling Powder. After sweating, vomiting, and purging, if there is regret and sleeplessness, use the Zhi Zhi Decoction. For those who cannot sleep day or night, use the Suan Zao Ren Decoction. For incoherent speech and dry heaving preventing sleep, use the Jie Du Decoction. For delirium, frequent urination, restlessness, and little sleep, use the Bai Hu Decoction with San Zhi; if accompanied by blood stasis, use the Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction. </p>
<p>In Shaoyin syndrome with diarrhea and thirst, or if they cannot sleep after diarrhea, use the Zhu Ling Decoction. If there is restlessness and insomnia for two or three days in Shaoyin, use the Huang Lian Ji Zi Decoction. After diarrhea with Yang deficiency and a sinking pulse, with no exterior symptoms, quiet at night but restless during the day, cannot sleep; use the Gu Jiang Fu Decoction, or Si Ni Decoction with Fu Ling. If there is much sweating, use the Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction. For insomnia after recovery from a cold, it indicates that Yin energy has not yet restored, use the Zhi Zi Wu Mei Decoction, or the Wen Dan Decoction with Zhu Ru. For those who are deficient, use the Shi Wei Wen Dan Decoction. For those appearing disoriented, use the Zhu Que Pill. According to the ancient method: for insomnia, use the Dan Shu Suan Zao Powder.

<li>Phlegm stagnation: Use Warm Gallbladder Decoction, adding rhizome of nux vomica, sour jujube seed, and powdered realgar.</li>
<li>Water retention: For mild cases, add calamus, polygala, and atractylodes to Six Gentleman Decoction; for severe cases, use Saliva Suppressing Pill.</li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Cold Damage: Method of Treatment for Cold Damage Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When yang is excessive and yin is deficient, one cannot sleep day or night. This is because the night is dominated by yin; when yin is strong, one can close their eyes and sleep peacefully. If yin is overcome by yang, then one will be disturbed and unable to sleep all night. This is what is meant by &quot;yin deficiency causing restless nights.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is sweating and a dry nose, and one cannot sleep, this indicates that the pathogen is on the surface. If there is dry stool in the stomach, accompanied by excessive heat and agitation, leading to profuse sweating, and the fluids in the stomach are depleted causing sleeplessness, then the pathogen is located internally. When the stomach is unwell, one cannot rest; therefore, it is appropriate to disperse heat and harmonize the stomach. </p>
<p>If there is sweating, vomiting, or purging that leads to restlessness and inability to sleep, then one should use Gardenia and Soybean Decoction to promote the expulsion of internal heat. </p>
<p>In cases of Shaoyin disease, where there is internal heat and restlessness preventing sleep, it is also advisable to support yin and disperse heat. If one cannot sleep after recovery, it indicates that heat and various yang factors are combined and yin has not yet been restored. If there is excessive sweating and a severe deficiency of yang leading to sleeplessness, if there are no heat symptoms, Ginger and Aconite Decoction should be used to restore yin and revive yang.

<p><strong>Treatment Methods for Febrile Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>In Shaoyin disease, the pulse is weak, deep, and thin; the patient only desires to lie down and sweats without distress. They feel a wish to vomit. After five to six days, there are bowel movements; if they become agitated and cannot sleep, it leads to death. In cases of febrile disease, it is crucial not to see the Yin pulse, hence Zhongjing says that with Shaoyin disease, if the pulse is deep, it must be urgently warmed. Now, if the pulse is weak, deep, and thin, along with visible external symptoms, a desire to lie down, and sweating without distress, it indicates that Yang is no longer functioning; the desire to vomit shows an invasion by Yin evil; if they further have bowel movements, it means the organ&#39;s energy must be utterly exhausted. Moreover, initially, they were not distressed, but now they are agitated; they initially desired to sleep, but now cannot rest. With only a thread of Yang remaining and such turmoil, can it still be restored? After bowel movements, if there is sweating and the pulse is weak and deep, and the body is not greatly warm, use the Ginger and Aconite Decoction as a rescue method.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition manifests with restlessness during the day, making it impossible to sleep, while at night there is tranquility, with no nausea or thirst, and no external symptoms. The pulse is deep and faint, and the body does not exhibit severe heat. This condition, mentioned earlier, recurs after sweating and is characterized by a faint pulse and chills, which is due to both internal and external deficiency. Mistaking sweating for a loss of yang and misusing purgatives can lead to a loss of yin, hence it is said that both inner and outer are deficient. However, there is no need to elaborate on the prescriptions, as using aconite to revive yang and ginseng to nourish yin is already established practice. This serves as a teaching about the subtle essence, illustrating that the signs of lost yang are significantly more pronounced than those of lost yin. Yang is active during the day, causing heat and restlessness that hinders sleep, whereas yin is active at night, bringing peace without nausea or thirst. Can aconite and ginseng be evenly applied to both yin and yang? It is essential to use dried ginger and aconite, which are more specifically warming, to adequately revive yang and ensure harmony against the stronger yin.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Insomnia</strong></p>
<p>Insomnia, though varying with different illnesses, can be fully understood through the concepts of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot; Insomnia is rooted in the yin principle, with the spirit as its master; when the spirit is settled, sleep follows, but when the spirit is unsettled, sleep does not occur. The disturbances causing this unsettlement arise either from external pathogenic influences or from a deficiency in nourishing energy. When there are pathogenic factors, the symptoms are predominantly substantive; when there are none, they are entirely illusory. For instance, insomnia caused by illnesses like cold, flu, or malaria is due to external pathogenic invasion. In contrast, insomnia caused by phlegm, fire, cold, or water, as well as from issues related to diet, anger, or anxiety, stems from internal stagnation and reversal. Outside of these conditions, insomnia due to overthinking, fatigue, fright, and doubt, or chronic insomnia without apparent burden, is generally attributed to a deficiency in true yin essence and blood, resulting in a failure of Yin and Yang to interact and causing the spirit to remain unsettled in its abode. Understanding these two aspects allows one to know how to treat the condition. Drinking strong tea or having matters weighing on one’s mind can also prevent sleep due to the depletion of heart energy.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart conceals the spirit, serving as the residence of yang energy; it guards the principal energy and controls the transformation of yang. Generally, when the guarding energy enters the yin, it becomes still; in stillness, sleep occurs, as the yang naturally finds its return, leading to the spirit feeling secure and at rest. However, strong tea, due to its yin and cold nature, greatly suppresses the original yang. When yang is restrained by yin, the spirit feels restless, which is why one cannot sleep. Furthermore, when the heart is disturbed by affairs, the spirit moves; if the spirit moves, it cannot be still, which is also why one cannot sleep. Therefore, to seek sleep, one should nourish the yang within the yin and eliminate movement from stillness to obtain it.</p>
<p>When one takes medicine and immediately falls asleep, this is an indication of the effectiveness of the treatment. If the evil energy resides in the spirit&#39;s chamber, sleep will certainly be uneasy. However, if the medicine is appropriate, upon ingesting even a small amount, many evils will dissipate, and the intruders will leave, allowing the people to achieve peace. This mechanism of treatment and disorder can be discerned in an instant, and the effectiveness of the medicine can be known from this. Those who mismanage their treatment and recklessly use remedies only contribute to chaos and cruelty, which will surely lead to further annoyance and discomfort. The wise will see the signs and should use this knowledge to anticipate outcomes.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p>Those who are unwell and unable to sleep must be deficient in vital energy. The essence governs blood; if blood is deficient, there is no way to nurture the heart.

For these symptoms, the main treatment should focus on nourishing both essence and energy. </p>

<p>If emotional distress injures the inner organs, depleting blood and energy—whether fear injures the kidneys or fright damages the gallbladder, causing the spirit to lose its anchor and lead to insomnia—one should use Wufu Drink, Qifu Drink, or Sanyin Decoction, or Wujunzi Decoction, choosing as appropriate.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If fatigue and worry injure the heart and spleen, leading to insufficient vital energy, where clear yang does not rise, and if external pathogens do not resolve, resulting in cold and heat causing insomnia, one should take the Gui Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If overthinking causes a deficiency of the heart leading to insomnia, accompanied by slight irritability, then the Yang Xin Decoction or the Suan Zao Ren Decoction may be used. If excessive worry exhausts the heart&#39;s blood and stirs the heart fire, leading to irritability, thirst, and insomnia, the Tian Wang Bu Xin Decoction should be used.

If there is exhaustion of essence and blood, combined with phlegm and qi accumulation, leading to anxiety and restless nights, the Secret Formula Suan Zao Ren Decoction should be used.

<p>In general, if a person experiences excessive fatigue and worry, it will surely lead to the consumption of blood and the spirit being unanchored, thus causing insomnia.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Xu Donggao said: There are those who cannot sleep due to phlegm-fire disturbance, causing unrest in the heart and spirit, excessive thoughts and worries, and a fiery phlegm accumulation. There are also those who cannot sleep because of insufficient kidney water, where the true yin does not rise, leading to an excessive heart fire. Additionally, some experience spleen fatigue with stagnant fire, unable to disperse, which causes restlessness in the early morning as the qi rises. For these conditions, methods to invigorate the spleen, resolve stagnation, clear phlegm, and descend fire should be employed. </p>
<p>Those with a strong constitution who occasionally suffer from phlegm-fire leading to insomnia should first use rolling phlegm pills, followed by calming the spirit pills, or similar remedies to clear the heart and cool the stomach. Conversely, those with a weak constitution, whether due to overexertion or after an illness, represent a state of deficiency. They should use blood-nourishing and calming medicines.</p>
<p>Generally, those who cannot sleep after an illness or postpartum women suffer from deficient blood and qi, as well as insufficient heart and spleen organs. Even if phlegm-fire is present, it is not advisable to treat it too aggressively; instead, supportive nourishment should take precedence, potentially supplemented with medicines to clear phlegm and descend fire. For those whose insomnia is not attributed to illness, phlegm-fire should be addressed, but still supplemented with blood-nourishing and deficiency-replenishing remedies for a proper approach. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>When a person suffers from a frightened heart and restlessness, or is unable to sleep at night, it is often thought to be a heart ailment. However, it is not a heart issue but a kidney problem. To calm the mind, one should treat the kidneys. The prescription includes three taels each of ginseng, cooked rehmannia, shan za (sour jujube), angelica, sweetflag, ophiopogon, poria, and fu shen; two taels of ziziphus, and one tael each of jujube seed and white mustard seeds; and five qian each of coptis, cinnamon, and amomum. Grind these ingredients into a powder, form into pills with honey, and take five qian daily, either with wine or soup. This formula treats insomnia. It suffices to use ginseng, poria, angelica, and ophiopogon. If the insomnia arises from fire, adding coptis is adequate. Why then use cooked rehmannia and shan za, which nourish the kidneys, adding cinnamon to stimulate heat? It is misunderstood that insomnia is simply a heart issue; it is actually that the heart qi does not return to the kidneys. By using cooked rehmannia and shan za to nourish the kidneys, the kidney qi becomes rooted and naturally connects to the heart. The addition of cinnamon to warm the life gate enables the kidney qi to be warm, allowing the ministerial fire to have control, thus causing the heart qi to descend. The sovereign and minister harmonize, bringing unity of mind and intention.</p>
<p>When a person cannot rest their head comfortably while lying down, the prescription is five taels of ginseng, two taels each of zizi and roasted jujube seed, eight taels of cooked rehmannia, four taels of shan za, one tael of biota seed, three taels each of ophiopogon and fu shen, and five qian of dried tangerine peel, all ground into a powder and made into pills with honey, taking one tael daily with boiling water. In five days, one finds peace, and full recovery occurs. This is called the Tranquil Mind and Restful Sleep Pills.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>　　《医学纲目》曰：绍兴癸丑次明有董生者，患神气不宁，每卧则魂飞扬，觉身在床而神魂离体，惊悸多魇，通夕无寐，更医不效。予为诊视，询之曰：医作何病治？董曰：众皆以为心病。予曰：以脉言之，肝经受邪，非心病也。肝气因虚，邪气袭之，肝藏魂者也，游魂为变，平人肝不受邪，卧则魂归于肝，神静而得寐，今肝有邪，魂不得归，是以卧则魂飞扬若离体也。肝主怒，故小怒则剧。董欣然曰：前此未之闻，虽未服药，已觉沉疴去体矣。遂处方以赠，服一月而病悉除。方用真珠母为君，龙齿佐之。真珠母入肝经为第一，龙齿与肝同类也。龙齿、虎睛，今人例以为镇心药。不知龙齿安魂，虎睛定魄，各从其类也。盖东方苍龙，木也，属肝而藏魂；西方白虎，金也，属肺而藏魄。龙能变化，故魂游而不定；虎能专静，故魄止而有守。予谓治魄不宁者，宜以虎睛；治魂飞扬者，宜以龙齿。万物有成理而不失，在夫人达之而已。<a id="orig-52p" href="#trans-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Overview&quot; states: In the second year of the Shaoxing period, there was a certain Mr. Dong who suffered from unsettled spirit energy. Whenever he lay down, his soul would rise and he felt as if his body was on the bed while his spirit had left his body. He experienced frequent fright and nightmares, and was unable to sleep throughout the night; previous treatments had been ineffective. Upon examining him, I inquired what illness the doctors had treated him for. Mr. Dong replied: &quot;Everyone thinks it&#39;s a heart illness.&quot; I said: &quot;From a pulse perspective, the liver meridian is afflicted by evil, it is not a heart illness.&quot; Due to the liver energy being weak, it is attacked by evil energy, and the liver houses the soul. When the soul wanders, it changes; a normal person’s liver does not succumb to evil—when they lie down, the soul returns to the liver, the spirit settles, and sleep is achieved. Now that there is evil in the liver, the soul cannot return, hence it flies away as if leaving the body. The liver governs anger, thus even slight anger is intense. Mr. Dong cheerfully said: &quot;I have never heard of this before. Even without taking medicine, I already feel that my deep illness has left my body.&quot; Subsequently, I wrote a prescription for him, and after a month of taking it, all his ailments were removed. The prescription used mother of pearl as the main ingredient, supplemented by dragon’s teeth. Mother of pearl enters the liver meridian as the primary remedy, and dragon’s teeth are similar to the liver. Dragon’s teeth and tiger’s eye are commonly regarded today as heart-soothing medicines. However, it should be noted that dragon’s teeth calm the soul while tiger’s eye stabilizes the spirit, each belonging to its own category. The eastern azure dragon represents wood, belongs to the liver, and houses the soul; the western white tiger represents metal, belongs to the lungs, and houses the spirit. The dragon can change, causing the soul to wander and be unsettled; the tiger can concentrate, leading the spirit to be still and secured. I suggest that for treating an unsettled spirit, one should use tiger’s eye; for a wandering soul, one should use dragon’s teeth. All things have their own principles and do not lose them; it is merely for humans to realize them.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Classic of Returning to Spring&quot; states: A young boy of fifteen suffered from excessive mental exertion, experiencing little sleep, fright, and coldness. Initially, he was treated with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, along with Poria, Sour Jujube, and Polygala, which gradually alleviated the chills. He was then given the modified Gui Pi Decoction, resulting in reduced panic and more peace. Finally, the Yang Xin Decoction was administered, leading to complete recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; mentions: A woman experienced discomfort while carrying a burden, abdominal bloating, little sleep, diminished appetite, and frequent menstruation. I noted that the spleen governs blood and controls saliva; her emotional distress harmed the spleen&#39;s ability to retain blood, contributing to excessive saliva. I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and the Ji Sheng Gui Pi Decoction, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; narrates the case of a man named Zhou Gong, over forty years of age, who developed a wasting illness due to the accumulation of work. He suffered from fatigue, reduced appetite, and frequent fears, coupled with insomnia lasting over six months. Interestingly, there was no thirst in the upper body, and he had no appetite for soups or water; when he did drink a little, it would be unabsorbed. However, he urinated two to three liters each night, with the urine appearing thick and turbid. He believed he was on the brink of death. Upon examining his pulse, it still felt weak, and he had not lost much weight, indicating that his stomach qi was still present. Therefore, I prescribed the Gui Pi Decoction, omitting the cypress and the Great Qi Supplementing Decoction, to nourish both yang and yin through alternating use. After administering over three hundred doses, including twenty pounds of ginseng, he fully recovered. This reflects the signs of spirit depletion above and essence depletion below.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>
