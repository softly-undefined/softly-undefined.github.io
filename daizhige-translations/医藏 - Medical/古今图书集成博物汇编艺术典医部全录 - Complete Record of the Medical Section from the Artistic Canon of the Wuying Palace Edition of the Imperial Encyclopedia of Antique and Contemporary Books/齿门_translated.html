<p><strong>Tooth Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Ancient Heavenly Truths</strong></p>
<p>At seven years old, a girl&#39;s kidney energy is strong, and her teeth grow longer. At three times seven, kidney energy is balanced, hence true teeth grow and become very long.<br><strong>[Note: For a girl at seven, the kidney energy is robust. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are extensions of the bones, so the teeth grow longer. True teeth are those that fully develop; with sufficient kidney energy, true teeth grow.]</strong>  </p>
<p>At eight years old, a boy&#39;s kidney energy is solid, hair grows longer and teeth grow. At three times eight, kidney energy is balanced, tendons and bones are strong, so true teeth grow and become very long. At five times eight, kidney energy declines, hair falls out and teeth become brittle. By eight times eight, teeth and hair fall away.<br><strong>[Note: True teeth grow strong and bones develop to their utmost. The kidneys are the source of life energy; for boys, when energy declines, at five times eight, the foundational energy begins to weaken, leading to hair loss and brittle teeth. By eight times eight, energy declines to a critical level, resulting in loss.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essential Diagnosis Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If Shaoyin ends, the face is dark, teeth are long and stained, the abdomen is bloated and blocked, unable to communicate above and below, thus it ends.<br><strong>[Note: The brilliance of the heart resides in the face. The darkness indicates an excess of water energy, while fire energy is diminished, leading to the escape of water energy. Long and stained teeth indicate a depletion of bone energy. A bloated abdomen and blockage, unable to communicate above and below, indicate the exhaustion of both heart and kidney energies, preventing vertical circulation.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>On the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: When yang is abundant, the body becomes hot, the pores are closed, breathing is rough, and one struggles to breathe with movements up and down. Sweating does not occur, yet there is heat, the teeth become dry and one feels vexed and grievance, the abdomen is full, leading to death. One can endure in winter but not in summer. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When yang prevails, it signifies the heat of fire, hence the body is hot. Heat on the surface results in closed pores; heat within causes rough breathing. When yin prevails in the abdomen, it causes downward movement; when yang prevails in the back, it causes upward movement. When yang dominates the whole body, there is no sweating and there is heat. The kidneys govern essence, hence the teeth become dry as the essence is depleted. The heart governs blood; hence one feels vexed as the blood is exhausted. A full abdomen indicates that the vital energy of the middle burner is completely depleted. This is the manifestation of death due to excessive yang heat. However, one can prolong existence in winter but cannot escape in summer.</p>
<p><strong>On Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>Those with kidney heat have dark coloration and decayed teeth. </p>
<p>The emperor said: A person suffers from headache for several years, how could this arise, and what is it called? Qibo replied: It arises from having been subjected to extreme cold, penetrating to the marrow. The marrow is dominated by the brain; when the marrow rebels, it causes headache and also tooth pain, the condition is named reversal of qi. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The kidneys produce marrow, hence being affected by the cold results in it penetrating to the marrow. All marrow is related to the brain, thus the brain is fundamental. When the inverted evil of the marrow rises, it enters the brain, which is why the headache persists for several years. The teeth are the remnants of bone, which is why they also ache. This cold penetrates below and rebels upward to the summit, thus it is named reversal of qi.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>The Essential Discourse on True Reality</strong></p>
<p>In the year of the Yin, in the season of spring, heat prevails and overpowers. The people suffer from constant sounds in their abdomen, with Qi rising up to the chest, leading to breathing difficulties and inability to stand for long. They experience cold and heat, skin pain, closed eyes, toothaches, and swelling. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Yin in spring refers to the year of the rabbit or rooster. The constant sounds in the abdomen indicate excessive fire energy. Qi rising to the chest suggests that the fire energy ascends. Breathing difficulties, inability to stand for long, cold and heat, and skin pain indicate that excessive fire is affecting the lungs and metal element. Closed eyes signify severe heat and Yin deficiency, leading to a sensitivity to sunlight. Toothaches and swelling indicate that heat affects the Yangming channel.</p>
<p><strong>Lingshu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meridian Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming meridian of the hand has a branch that runs from the clavicle, through the neck, and into the cheeks, entering the lower teeth. The Yangming meridian of the foot travels down the outside of the nose and enters the upper teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Invaders Chapter</strong></p>
<p>In the heavens, there are constellations; on earth, there are teeth.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Death</strong></p>
<p>If a patient&#39;s lips are swollen and teeth are decayed, the patient will die; the spleen and kidneys are exhausted.<br>If a patient&#39;s teeth suddenly turn black, they will die in thirteen days; the lesser yin is exhausted.<br><strong>Zhong Cang Jing</strong> [Han Dynasty, Hua Tuo]</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Death</strong></p>
<p>If the stomach is exhausted, and the teeth fall out with a yellow face, the patient will die in seven days. [Some say ten days.] A face lacking luster with black teeth will die.<br>If teeth suddenly become black, they will die in thirteen days.</p>
<p><strong>Qian Jin Fang</strong> [Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>In general, when the gums are exposed, it is often due to malnutrition (with worms residing above and below) and lunar eclipses. Applying the ash of grassy plants to the gums at night ensures full recovery; do not eat oil; one or two nights will suffice. Eating oil and dried dates can exacerbate the condition. Thus, those suffering from dental issues should avoid oil, dried dates, and cinnamon bark. Each morning, take a pinch of salt in the mouth, gargle with warm water, and brush the teeth, tapping them a hundred times. This should not take more than five days for the mouth and teeth to stabilize. If a person is unable to eat fruits and vegetables due to exposed tooth roots, this saltwater method of cleaning and tapping the teeth will surely cure them. Many people who suffer from dental diseases often do so due to eating or drinking during lunar eclipses, so the knowledgeable should be cautious. Therefore, during eclipses of the sun and moon, it is especially advisable to avoid eating and drinking, including for young children.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Direct Pointer to Ren Zhai</strong><br><strong>[Song Dynasty, Yang Shiying]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Teeth and the Kidneys</strong><br>Teeth are the end of the bones and are nourished by the marrow; thus, the kidneys are primarily responsible for them. Therefore, when the kidneys weaken, the teeth become loose; when the essence is abundant, the teeth are strong; and when there is deficiency heat, the teeth become unstable.</p>
<p><strong>Toxin Phlegm Pain</strong><br>Heat produces phlegm, which attacks with toxic gases, filling the channels and causing pain. For outward symptoms of abundant phlegm with coughing and spitting, it is suitable to use Er Chen Tang combined with Xi Xin, Zhi Ke, fresh ginger, Da Zao, and Wu Mei decocted. Additionally, use turmeric and Piper longum decocted together, wait until warm, and immerse the tongue in the decoction to allow saliva to flow out, which is effective.</p>
<p><strong>Insect Erosion Pain</strong><br>When individuals do not maintain clean teeth while eating, the foul-smelling gases accumulate over time, causing the gums to have holes where insects erode the teeth. If one tooth is eroded completely, the others will worsen, leading to conditions like gnawing (hidden internal insects). It is essential to eliminate the insects to stop the pain.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Causes of Pain</strong></p>
<p>The branches of the Yangming hand channel enter the teeth; if blocked, the teeth feel loose; if empty, they show signs of exposure; if wind accompanies, it attacks the head and face; if there is consumption, it leads to decay.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If a lump the size of a bean appears by the tooth, it is due to fire from the spleen and stomach channels. It is advisable to use a small knife to pierce it, apply Borneol powder, and then take Clear Stomach Decoction or Sweet Tangerine Decoction, all will heal.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Swelling</strong></p>
<p>The teeth are associated with the kidney channel; this condition may arise from wind entering through deficiency, excess drinking causing swelling, blood deficiency causing swelling, injury causing swelling, or sexual exhaustion leading to kidney deficiency causing swelling. The treatment should be tailored based on the specific symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Exposed</strong></p>
<p>Tooth exposure refers to heat surging from the spleen and stomach. In this condition, bleeding occurs between the teeth, associated with the spleen above and the stomach below. If there is difficulty treating blood-tinged phlegm that is abundant, urgent treatment is needed, as delay may lead to severe consequences. First, cleanse with clam water, then blow in the medication.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Entering the Brain and Causing Pain</strong></p>
<p>Kidney deficiency leading to great cold results in headaches and tooth pain, which, if severe and persistent for years, indicates this condition; it can be treated with Tian Nan Xing pills.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Pain Belongs to Fire</strong></p>
<p>Some individuals experience pain in their upper and lower teeth; whenever pain arises, they promptly remove them. Not long later, all their teeth are gone. By the age of fifty, they can no longer eat hard substances. The pain in the upper and lower teeth is caused by excessive wind and heat in the Yangming meridians of the hands and feet. One can use medicines like Da and Xiao Chengqi Decoction, Zangyong Pills, or Qu Feng Pills to purge them, and then the pain should naturally stop. The Inner Canon states that all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers are associated with heart fire. Wang Bing said: All origins arise from the heart. The heart represents fire; fire gives rise to earth. It is important to understand the reasons for tooth emergence.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Pain</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from tooth pain due to wind excess that does not heal over time, one can insert a single Ba Dou seed into the flame and let it emit smoke. Before it loses its potency, smoke it over the root of the tooth; this will bring healing.<br>— <em>Dongyuan’s Ten Treatises</em> [Yuan Dynasty, Li Gao]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Teeth are markers of the kidneys, while the mouth is the opening of the spleen. Many meridians converge around the mouth; the teeth are where the Yangming meridians of both hands and feet pass through. The upper gums belong to the Earth and are connected to the meridian of the Stomach in the foot Yangming, which remains still and motionless. The lower gums chew food, moving continuously; this is connected to the meridian of the Large Intestine in the hand Yangming. The hand Yangming dislikes cold drinks and prefers warmth, whereas the foot Yangming enjoys cold drinks and dislikes heat; hence, their illnesses differ. The teeth, as indicators of kidney health, also prefer cold; cold makes them strong. When heat accumulates, the teeth become loose, and pain persists, which is why treatments vary.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>There are those who experience pain from aversion to heat, and those who experience pain from aversion to cold; some suffer pain from both aversion to cold and heat. There are others who, when drinking little cold and much hot, experience pain, and those who, when drinking little hot and much cold, also experience pain. Some have loose teeth that cause pain; some have cavities that cause pain; others have gums eroded by decay, bleeding and causing pain, while some have swollen gums that cause pain. Additionally, if there is wind-evil in the spleen and stomach, one may feel pain from just the wind. There are also those whose teeth are heavily decayed by worms, leading to loss and color change, resulting in toothache from decayed teeth; others have poor stomach energy unable to endure the cold, with exposed teeth causing pain. Moreover, there are those with painful teeth that emit a foul odor deterring closeness. Since pain is not uniform, can one medicine resolve all?</p>
<p>When there is excess heat in the stomach and pain in the upper teeth is particularly severe, it is advisable to use Liangge Powder. Steep rhubarb with wine as the main ingredient, add Anemarrhena, gypsum, and Cimicifuga as assistants, and frequently hold and swallow it to recover.</p>
<p>For those who slightly dislike cold drinks but greatly dislike hot drinks, it is best to use Lixiao Powder.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Heat Pain</strong></p>
<p>Heat pain occurs when there is excess heat in the intestines and stomach, leading to swollen gums and foul breath. It is advisable to use Cool Diaphragm Powder with additions of Anemarrhena, Gypsum, and Cimicifuga. Use wine-steamed Rhubarb as the primary ingredient; simply swish and swallow to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with Heat</strong></p>
<p>Tooth pain arises when damp heat in the stomach rises and affects the gums, especially when obstructed by wind-cold or cold food, preventing the damp heat from dissipating, thus causing pain. Cold is the symptom, so use warm and stimulating topical treatments; heat is the root cause, so take warming and cooling internal medications. For toothache, use Wutong Tears powdered with a little Musk rubbed on. For severe tooth pain, use Pepper and Piper cubeba to disperse superficial heat, supplemented with Cimicifuga and Huai Shi, assisted by warming cooling herbs like Schizonepeta, Mint, and Asarum. Using purely cooling herbs may prevent the pain from resolving. Treatment must be targeted, using species such as Piper cubeba, Chuanxiong, Mint, Schizonepeta, Asarum, Camphor, and coarse salt.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Medical Correct Transmission</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Yu Tuan)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the onset of hundreds of diseases stems from both fundamental and superficial causes. The teeth are external signs of the kidneys, and remnants of the bones. The stomach&#39;s Yangming channel connects to the gums above the teeth; the Yangming channel of the large intestine connects to the gums below the teeth. The hand&#39;s Yangming dislikes cold drinks and prefers hot ones, while the foot&#39;s Yangming dislikes hot drinks and prefers cold ones, which explains the different types of pain they experience related to cold and heat. If one opens their mouth and feels exacerbated pain, it indicates an invasion of wind evil in the intestines and stomach; if the breath becomes foul and unbearable upon opening the mouth, it indicates accumulated heat in the intestines and stomach. There are cases where pain causes the teeth to loosen, or pain leads to tooth decay, or gaps between teeth inhibit eating—all of these are related. Generally, if the gums are receding and the teeth are loose, it indicates a deficiency in the kidney essence; the treatment should focus on nourishing Yin and supplementing the kidneys. If there is aversion to cold and a strong heat sensation along with foul breath, it indicates excessive heat in the stomach; the treatment should focus on calming the stomach and draining fire. The so-called evidence of wind evil and insect infestation is essentially due to heat generating wind, which in turn generates insects. If the fire in the intestines and stomach is subdued, and additional measures are taken to cleanse the teeth and eliminate insects, there will inevitably be tranquility in treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Pain</strong></p>
<p>Tooth pain can be caused by wind, toxins, or heat obstruction, tooth decay, and kidney deficiency. If the exact condition is not identified, it is advisable to use a dispersing powder for wind and toxins applied topically. For all conditions, it is appropriate to use three parts of fried sweet fennel and one part of fried salt, ground together for regular application. If tooth worms have emerged, and the cavity is hollow and painful, this is crucial to recognize. It is advisable to use a small amount of frankincense, heated until soft to fill the cavity. If kidney deficiency leads to floating and painful teeth, particularly if there is aversion to cold and a feeling of internal heat, it may present symptoms similar to wanting to fall out. In such cases, it is beneficial to use kidney nourishing pills and intermittently take black tin pills.</p>
<p><strong>Compendium of Materia Medica</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Li Shizhen)</p>
<p><strong>Eating Sour Foods Makes Teeth Soft</strong></p>
<p>People from Chu often eat sour foods, resulting in soft teeth. This is because the water generates wood; with weakened moisture and strong wood element, the teeth are affected in this way.</p>

<p><strong>Swollen and Painful Gums</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Swollen and painful gums, tooth pain with looseness, or blackening and falling out of teeth; the world commonly treats this as kidney deficiency. Little do they realize this pertains to damp heat in the Yangming channel. Though the teeth belong to the kidneys, they arise from the gums, and the upper and lower gums correlate with the Yangming large intestine and stomach, akin to wood growing from the earth. The intestines and stomach are harmed by fine wines, rich flavors, and greasy, sweet foods, causing damp heat to rise. Consequently, the gums become inflamed and painful, possibly bleeding or infested with worms, leading to the discomfort, looseness, blackening, or loss of teeth. Treatment should focus on dispelling the damp heat of the Yangming, thus clearing and soothing the gums, allowing the teeth to stabilize and strengthen.</p>
<p>[Note: For tooth pain, if caused by damp heat in the hand and foot Yangming channels, use Dongyuan&#39;s Qingwei Powder; if due to wind-cold entering the brain leading to headaches and tooth pain, use Qianghuo Fuzi Xixin Decoction; if caused by excessive thinking damaging the spleen, use Guipi Decoction; if due to accumulated anger, use Yueju Pill; if arising from consumption of alcohol and fried foods, use Qingwei Powder; if related to diet harming the spleen, use Liu Junzi Decoction; if from overexertion damaging original qi, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction; if the spleen and stomach are inherently weak, use Liu Jun Gui Decoction; if due to kidney yin deficiency, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan; if from kidney yang deficiency, use Bawei Wan; if both yin and yang are deficient, use Shibu Wan; if there is spleen and kidney deficiency with cold, use Anshen Wan. Mr. Xu Yongcheng remarked: all tooth diseases accompanied by cold or heat symptoms, pertain to the hand and foot Yangming channels; tooth loosening and gum loss, correspond to the foot Shaoyin channel; tooth decay, swelling, pain, and bleeding are all caused by stomach fire. There are also mixed syndromes from various channels and external factors affecting patients.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming - Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stasis Blood Pain</strong><br>When wind-heat attacks the gums, causing blood to flow out, phlegm stagnates and does not dissipate, resulting in pulling pain and piercing discomfort. It is advisable to use Xijiao Dihuang Decoction, or a modified version of Ganlu Drink with the addition of Shengma.</p>
<p><strong>Loose and Shaky Gums</strong><br>If the gums are loose and shaky, it indicates kidney essence deficiency. It is advisable to use Eight Treasure Pills to nourish yin and tonify the kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>Wind-Heat Pain</strong><br>In cases of wind-heat, the external wind and internal heat clash, leading to swollen and painful gums with a foul-smelling discharge. It is advisable to use Xijiao Shengma Decoction, along with Jing Jie Decoction for gargling.</p>
<p><strong>Wind-Cold Pain</strong><br>In cases of wind-cold, the gums are neither swollen nor decayed but gradually become loose. It is advisable to use Warm Wind Powder, along with Kai Xiao Powder for gargling.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Tooth Decay Pain</strong></p>
<p>Tooth decay leads to bone exposure and bleeding; in such cases, Yuchi Powder should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Cold and Heat Sensitivity</strong></p>
<p>The foot yangming stomach channel enters the upper teeth; this condition prefers cold drinks and despises hot drinks. The hand yangming large intestine channel enters the lower teeth; this condition prefers hot drinks and despises cold drinks. Heat-induced tooth pain fears cold water, cold-induced tooth pain fears hot water; a tooth that fears neither temperature is caused by wind.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Pain</strong></p>
<p>If pain arises from damp heat being obstructed by cold wind, Danggui Longdan Powder should be used. For longstanding tooth pain, with black decay and falling out, relief comes from slightly cooling; this is due to the heat of dampness from rich foods. The Stomach Regulating Qi Decoction with added Huanglian should be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The right Guan pulse is rapid and forceful, or string-like and forceful, indicating wind heat in the intestines and stomach causing pain. The尺 pulse is large and weak, suggesting kidney deficiency, leading to loose and mobile teeth with fiery heat rising and causing pain.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In dental conditions, if there is pain when opening the mouth to let in wind, it indicates wind evil in the stomach; if there is a foul odor when opening the mouth, it indicates accumulated heat in the intestines and stomach; if the root of the tooth is swollen and painful, it indicates stomach heat; if there is pain and mobility, it indicates kidney deficiency; if there are cavities leading to pain, it indicates decay. Upper molar pain relates to deficiency heat in the kidney channel of the foot Shaoyin; use Xiangxintang. Lower molar pain relates to wind and deficiency heat in the hand Yangming; use Baizhitang.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Dental and Oral Health</strong></p>
<p>The teeth are a marker of the kidneys, while the mouth is an opening of the spleen. Many meridians converge in the mouth, as seen with the teeth and gums. Mr. Xu Yongcheng states: Teeth are affected by conditions of cold and heat, which pertain to the Yangming meridian of the limbs. Their mobility and loss relate to the Shaoyin meridian of the feet. Cases of tooth decay, gum swelling, bleeding, pain, and foulness are all associated with damp-heat and stomach fire, or the entrenchment of pathogens from various meridians and external factors. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: For severe damp-heat and pain, administer Chengqi Decoction; for milder cases, use Qīngwèi Powder to regulate it. If there is large intestine heat with swollen, painful gums, apply Qīngwèi Powder; if severe, use Tiáowèi Pill to clear it. For pain due to six stagnations, use Yuèjū Pill to resolve it. If pain is due to deficiency of the central qi, use Bǔzhōng Yìqì Decoction to supplement it. If pain arises from excessive thinking affecting the spleen, use Guīpí Decoction to regulate it. If there is kidney deficiency with heat and pain, use Liùwèihǎo Pill to supplement. If it&#39;s kidney deficiency with cold and pain, use Huánshǎo Dān to replenish; in serious cases, employ Bāwèi Pill as the primary treatment. For conditions associated with wind-heat, use Dúhuó Powder. If great cold has invaded the brain, apply Báizhǐ Powder. For wind-cold entering the brain, use Qiānghuó Fùzǐ Decoction. Diseases are numerous, and treatment should be adapted according to the clinical situation.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>The Six Essentials of Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>On the Causes of Alcohol and Lust</strong>  </p>
<p>The gums belong to the stomach, while the teeth belong to the kidneys. In middle age, excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust weakens the essence, which cannot nourish the teeth. Heavy and toxic wine gradually corrupts the stomach, leading to a polluted state in the gums and teeth; when they are polluted, they decay. This is akin to how a tree falls if the ground is not solid. When the teeth loosen, it suggests imminent loss. Tooth root pain indicates heat in the gums approaching decay. The classics state: at the age of fifty-eight, a man&#39;s kidney essence declines, leading to hair loss and tooth decay. Once he reaches forty, if the kidneys have already weakened, how much more will they suffer from great consumption? Those who seek life should not place full blame on medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Affiliation of the Teeth</strong>  </p>
<p>The teeth are associated with the Foot Shaoyin Kidney Channel.<br>(Note: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: at the age of fifty-eight, a man&#39;s kidney essence declines, leading to hair loss and tooth decay. It also says: in cases of kidney heat, the color darkens and teeth decay. For those at the end of the Shaoyin phase, the face is dark, teeth are elongated, and decay occurs.) The teeth are divided into upper and lower gums; the upper gums belong to the Foot Yangming Stomach Channel.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that pathogenic factors affecting the foot&#39;s Yangming channel can cause nasal bleeding and cold in the upper teeth. The &quot;Zhenjing&quot; mentions that pain in the upper teeth prefers cold and dislikes heat, and that one should apply acupressure to the original point at the Chongyang point, located in the artery between the bones of the feet, five inches above the ankles. Note: &#39;丬&#39; refers to &#39;judge.&#39; The left half is &#39;丬,&#39; the right half is &#39;片.&#39; Zhu Danxi suggested moxibustion at the Sanli point, which is a major point of the foot&#39;s Yangming channel, located on the outer side of the leg, three fingerbreadths below the knees, about a finger&#39;s width away from the tibia, between the two tendons.</p>
<p>The lower gums are related to the hand&#39;s Yangming large intestine channel. Zhang Jiegugu stated that Qinjiao can relieve lower tooth pain and eliminate wind and dampness of this channel. The &quot;Zhenjing&quot; states that pain in the lower teeth prefers heat and dislikes cold, thus one should apply acupressure to the original point at the Hegu point, situated in the valley between the first and second metacarpal bones of the hands. Zhu Danxi suggested moxibustion at the Sanjian point, which is a point of the hand&#39;s Yangming channel, located in the seam on the inner side of the second phalanx of the thumb and index finger, at the junction of the red and white flesh.</p>
<p>In boys, at the age of eight, kidney energy is abundant, and the teeth regenerate; by the age of thirty, permanent teeth emerge, by fifty, the teeth begin to decay, and by eighty, they are lost. The same applies to girls, who follow the number seven. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the extensions of the bones, nourished by their marrow, thus correlating with the cycles of heavenly essence. The branches of the foot&#39;s Yangming channel enter the upper teeth, while those of the hand&#39;s Yangming channel enter the lower teeth. If the marrow of the bones is insufficient and the Yangming pulse is weak, dental diseases will arise.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>How can this be explained? The Yangming channel is associated with the metal element, while the teeth belong to the water element of the kidneys. The branches of Yangming enter the teeth, which serves as the mother&#39;s qi nourishing and protecting its offspring. Therefore, when Yangming is strong, the teeth are firm and strong; when it is weak, the teeth become loose. </p>
<p>Hence, tooth pain occurs when external pathogens such as wind, cold, dampness, or heat invade the Yangming channel, accumulating and clashing with the qi and blood in the teeth, causing pain. If this heat and phlegm is abundant, there will be swelling and pain; if heat is not overly abundant, the gums may be slightly swollen and the roots feel elevated. </p>
<p>Toothaches caused by cavities are due to damp-heat leading to decay, eroding the roots and causing pain. If there is bleeding between the teeth, this is because the branches of Yangming have allowed wind-heat pathogens to enter the gums, clashing with the blood, resulting in bleeding. </p>
<p>Cavities occur when the Yangming channel is invaded by wind-heat pathogens, which clash with the qi and blood of the gums, leading to decay and the formation of purulent, foul-smelling fluid, referred to as tooth decay, or called &quot;wind decay.&quot; Teeth that have (hidden worms) are those where worms have eroded the teeth down to the gums, resulting in pus and foul fluid.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If there are protruding teeth, it is due to heat in the qi that transfers to the pulse, reaching the area between the teeth and gums, causing liquid foam to become pus; when qi and blood are exhausted, the flesh of the gums decays, resulting in exposed and protruding tooth roots. If the teeth are loose, it is due to the deficiency of the Yangming pulse, where qi and blood do not nourish, hence the looseness. If the teeth are darkened, it is because the marrow&#39;s qi and blood cannot flourish, leading to darkened teeth, referred to as &quot;decayed teeth.&quot; The same applies to yellow and black teeth. From this, can we not say that all dental diseases arise from the Yangming? Liu Zonghou states: external invasion of wind and cold, or intake of cold through the mouth, causing tooth pain, are all external factors. Actual heat and false fire, bone steaming and qi stagnation, blood heat with insect damage, are all internal causes. Damage from hard objects is neither an internal nor external cause. </p>
<p>In winter, when wind, cold, and dampness cause headaches, stiffness in the neck, and painful, loose teeth, one should take Mahuang powder. When severe cold attacks the brain, leading to both headaches and toothaches, one should take Xixin powder, Baizhi powder, or Scorpion Tail powder.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>To alleviate toothache, if using cooling medicines worsens the pain, one should treat it with a mixture of cardamom, Sichuan pepper, mint, schisandra, asarum, camphor, and fine salt ground to powder, applying it to the teeth. For pain that becomes worse with heat and subsides with cooling, treat with spicy and cooling medicines. If taking tonics for stomach heat leads to intolerable pain in upper and lower teeth, which pulls at the head causing intense pain, this is due to heat from the Yangming channel entering the brain. The patient prefers cold and despises heat, indicating heat in the Yangming channel. For teeth that prefer cold and dislike heat, use Qingwei Decoction.</p>
<p>If there is more cold than heat, the patient mildly dislikes warm drinks and severely dislikes cold drinks, suggesting the use of cardamom powder. If there is more heat than cold, the patient mildly dislikes cold drinks and severely dislikes warm drinks; use musk powder or rapid effect powder. For upper teeth pain, use Shenma powder; for lower teeth pain, use Baizhi powder.</p>
<p>Those who have habitually consumed a lot of meat may experience bad breath and loose, wobbly teeth, or constant bleeding, indicating internal injury from damp heat and excessive rich food, and should use Shenkong pill, Laoya powder, or a digestive powder with yellow medicine added. If heat causes tooth pain with swelling that spreads to the cheeks and jaw, this indicates heat in the Yangming channel, and one should use Jinfecao powder with ma huang and mint added as needed.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Bone Socket Wind</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: If the gums are swollen and painful, with intense cold and heat, and there is persistent decay, and treatments for dysentery are ineffective, what should be done? The response: This is known as Bone Socket Wind, also called Cheek Poison, caused by worries, thoughts, fright, and sorrow. It initially arises beneath the ear and between the neck, faintly under the skin, with a small nodule that gradually enlarges to the size of a walnut, becoming red and swollen, either above or below, or left or right, with a tight jaw making it impossible to eat. Begin by using a goose feather to probe and expel wind-phlegm. Take a Huanglian Detox Soup, along with Huangkui, Jiegeng, Chaihu, and Huangqin. Do not use knives or needles.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Palate Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: If there is an ulcer on the upper palate, resembling a purple grape, what should be done? The response: This is called a Hanging Abscess, related to the Hand Taiyin and Hand Jueyin Pericardium, causing intense cold and heat, with the tongue unable to extend and the mouth unable to open and close, leading to a desire to lie on one’s back, with red discharge from the nose. This is due to heat accumulation in the Hand and Foot Shaoyin channels and the Sanjiao. It is advisable to use Huanglian Disinfecting Drink with added Jiegeng and Yuan Shen; urgently puncture to expel bad blood, and apply a Rhinoceros Horn and Amber ointment. For the robust, take a gold pill. If treatment is delayed, and food and drink cannot be taken, along with confused spirit and chaotic pulse, it can result in death.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Tooth Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What about an abscess at the tooth root? It is called &quot;attached tooth abscess,&quot; caused by heat and poison in the Yangming Stomach channel. It is advisable to use Qingwei San (Clear Stomach Powder) or Huanglian Jiaodu Decoction to detoxify, or to puncture and drain the bad blood for recovery.<br>— From &quot;Surgical Authenticity&quot; by Chen Shigong (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Dental Disease</strong></p>
<p>Dental diseases can be caused by wind and fire, as well as damp-heat of the Yangming channel. Wind-related pain manifests with swelling upon exposure to wind, followed by pain, which can be treated with the Dispelling Wind Powder. Fire-related pain involves the tooth root pulling at the jaw and cheek, producing intermittent sharp pain, which can be alleviated by applying Ice Boron Powder, allowing saliva to flow and resolve the issue. When damp-heat in the Yangming channel causes pain, the affected areas may swell; in severe cases, this can pull at the temples, causing pain in the neck, with heat in the mouth and constipation. It would be appropriate to use Liangge San (Cool the Diaphragm Powder) with gypsum for treatment. If the swelling is high and soft, there is likely pus inside that should be lanced with a needle for drainage and healing. For gingival diseases that bleed incessantly, internally take Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction, and externally apply Ren Zhong Bai Powder. In children with teething issues, if the tooth root pierces the gum, causing pain like a thorn in the lip, use a beryllium needle to puncture the gum, removing the original tooth with the hand. If bleeding does not stop, replace with damp paper multiple times until the bleeding ceases. It is essential to avoid rich flavors, and the teeth will regrow as before.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Zouma Gan</p>
<p>Zouma Gan refers to a condition that develops rapidly and cannot be delayed in treatment. This ailment often arises from residual toxins of measles or smallpox, and can also be exacerbated by other severe illnesses. The condition manifests with decayed roots of teeth, resulting in a foul and blackened state. In severe cases, the gums may recede, and the roots become black and rotten, leading to the tearing of the cheeks and lips within a few days, which is indeed incurable. </p>
<p>At the initial onset, it is advisable to use aloe vera for a decoction to treat the condition, and externally apply either Ren Zhong Bai powder or Bing Peng powder to the affected area. The goal is to remove the blackened decay; the presence of fresh red flesh and bleeding is a good sign. If, at the time of treatment, the rotten flesh does not detach, and the decay begins to widen, along with continued swelling and persistent foul odor, and accompanied by unresolved body heat, these are all indications of an incurable condition.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>On Teeth</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: For men, at the age of eight, the kidney energy is strong, and teeth begin to regenerate. At the age of thirty-eight, true teeth emerge; at fifty-eight, the teeth become worn; and by eighty-eight, the teeth are gone. The same applies to women, with seven being the corresponding number. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the markers of bone, nourished by the marrow. All teeth belong to the kidneys, while the upper and lower gums belong to Yangming. The upper gums prefer cold and dislike heat; they relate to the foot Yangming stomach. The lower gums prefer heat and dislike cold; they relate to the hand Yangming large intestine. Any looseness, exposure or pain—whether painful or not, with or without bleeding—all presenting as if about to fall, are associated with the kidneys. The classic states: the heat of the kidneys leads to a black complexion and worn teeth. It also states: when the lesser yin is in decline, the face appears black, teeth extend and become coated. Conditions such as dental caries with swollen, immobile, ulcerating, foul-smelling gums all belong to Yangming. When there are complications from mixed influences or external causes, treatment should differentiate between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>In cases of kidney deficiency and cold, use Anshen Pills or Huanshao Dan; if severe, use the Bawei Pills to address it. During the cold winter months, if severe cold invades the head causing headaches and pain in the teeth and gums, this indicates an invasion of cold affecting both the Greater Yang and Lesser Yin. Zhongjing used the Mahuang, Fuzi, and Xixin Decoction for those with kidney deficiency, which is often present. If there is tooth pain, looseness, fatigue in the limbs, and a lack of appetite, this points to a deficiency in both the spleen and kidney; in such cases, Anshen Pills and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction should be taken together. </p>
<p>If someone prefers cold and dislikes heat, this indicates injury to the blood of the stomach; use the Qingwei Decoction. If they dislike cold but favor heat, this suggests injury to the stomach qi; use the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. Whenever tooth pain is triggered by exertion, particularly more so in the afternoon, or accompanied by thirst and a dark complexion, or nocturnal emissions, these all indicate heat from spleen and kidney deficiency; for this, use the Buzhong Yiqi along with Liuwuwei Pills or the Shiquan Dabu Decoction. If there is swelling and pain in the gums along with swelling of the cheeks, this indicates wind-heat in the stomach channel; use the Xijiao Shengma Decoction. If one drinks a lot and experiences tooth pain with cheek swelling, this indicates damp-heat in the stomach channel; use the Qingwei Decoction with Gegen, or a Jiexin Decoction.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Dental Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For toothache caused by kidney deficiency, the remedy is the Ziyin Dabu Pill combined with deer antler. The kidneys govern the bones; when the kidneys are deficient, the marrow weakens. Weak marrow leads to brittle bones, and brittle bones cannot hold the teeth securely, resulting in loose teeth. This can be compared to a broken table: if the wood is weak, the joints become loose and the wood can easily shake out. However, when it is nourished by water, the table is restored and the joints become secure. Thus, the treatment here focuses on nourishing the yin and replenishing the kidneys. When the kidneys are not deficient, the gums and bones are moist, and when the gums and bones are moist, the teeth are secure. This formula includes cooked rehmannia, achyranthes, eucommia, cornelian cherry, five-flavor fruit, and goji berries, all of which are substances that promote yin and benefit the kidneys.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Ba JI, conrong, fennel, yuanzhi, shichangpu, yam, and Fuling are all sweet and warm items. They can warm the kidneys and generate essence. As for deer antler, it is sourced from blood and qi, and possesses the most complete yin energy, hence it is used as a supplement to nourish the kidneys and replenish essence and marrow. The flesh of red dates is sweet and benefits the spleen, thus it is used in pill formulations.</p>
<p>When the Grand Minister of Qi had a toothache, Cang Gong made him a bitter angelica stew, which he gargled with three sheng daily; after five or six days, the illness was resolved. The bitterness soothes the tooth pests, and its coldness dispels wind and heat. Later generations, lacking tooth pests, still used bitter angelica for dental hygiene; prolonged use could lead to lower back issues, due to excess. This shows a lack of understanding regarding the affairs of the military and the politics of military actions, as none have succeeded without knowing these aspects.</p>
<p>For toothaches that are aggravated by cold and relieved by heat, the &quot;Tooth Powder&quot; is the remedy. When a person sleeps and opens their mouth, wind and cold can enter, leading to toothaches; consuming cold drinks exacerbates the affliction, while warm drinks dispel the cold and provide some relief. This formula contains Aconite and Chuanwu, both pungent and warming ingredients, used to warm away the cold.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The whole scorpion is a slightly toxic substance; it can be used to counteract cold poison and treat wind evils. Some prepare a decoction with dried ginger, black cardamom, and asarum to rinse with, which also serves to address cold issues. </p>
<p>For toothaches caused by wind-heat, which prefer cold and dislike heat, one should use Dingfeng Decoction for rinsing. This is due to the internal presence of wind-heat affecting the cheeks, where the邪火 becomes strong, leading to tooth pain. Therefore, consuming cold drinks can mildly balance yin and yang, alleviating pain, while hot drinks may exacerbate the fire and intensify the pain. </p>
<p>In this formula, we use tooth soap, schizonepeta, and green onion for their acrid warmth to disperse wind, and saltpeter and gypsum for their salty cold properties to drive off the heat. </p>
<p>For tooth pain associated with holes between the teeth, a combination of five ingredients—wutong tears, toad venom, thorn apple seeds, leek seeds, and lime—used in any one of these will yield remarkable results.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The phoenix tree weeps, indicating the toxicity of fire and wind diseases (with pests hidden beneath). Wang Hai often found this remarkable; toad venom leads to dental erosion, causing pain everywhere, which Lin Yuanli often found remarkable; the seeds of the wild tobacco cause vapor to expel pests (hiding beneath), which Master Sun often found remarkable; leeks burned with mugwort create smoke that drives away pests (hiding beneath), which Zhu Danxi often found remarkable. These are all methods of ancient times. </p>
<p>Now, I have obtained a new prescription: it involves simply using newly burned lime and honey pills applied directly to the areas of dental erosion, which will heal promptly—this has not been discussed by the ancients. The &quot;Benshi Fang&quot; states: To extract a tooth without touching the hand, take equal amounts of black cohosh and spikenard, and double the amount of Sichuan pepper and asarum, ground finely. Use a small amount on a needle to rub inside and outside the affected tooth several times; thus, if the tooth is daily injured, it will easily fall out. All four ingredients are spicy and hot; if applied repeatedly to the gums, they will gradually separate, which is a principle-based method.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Book of Jingyue</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Zhang Jiebin]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Evidence</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of dental diseases: the first is fire, the second is wind, and the third is kidney deficiency. Each of these diseases has different treatments; once the true nature is discerned, it is not difficult to treat dental issues.</p>
<p>For those with fire-related diseases, the pain must be located in the muscles around the gums, which may manifest as swelling, pain, erosion, foul odor, or bleeding from the gaps between teeth. All these symptoms indicate a problem within the meridians. The upper teeth are associated with the foot yangming channel and remain still; whereas, the lower teeth are associated with the hand yangming channel and move continuously when chewing. This illness is likely caused by an excess of rich foods, fine wines, and sweet flavors, leading to damp heat accumulating in the intestines and stomach, which then obstructs the meridians. Therefore, the treatment should focus on avoiding lavish foods and clearing the fire pathogen.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>For those suffering from dental diseases, the issue lies not in the meridians but in the teeth, mainly caused by damp heat transforming into tooth worms, which leads to erosion and cavities, resulting in decayed and painful teeth. The treatment should primarily focus on eliminating the worms. For those with strong damp heat, it is also advisable to clear the stomach fire.</p>
<p>In cases where dental issues arise from kidney deficiency, the problem lies not in the meridians but in the organs, as teeth are the endpoints of bones, and bones are governed by the kidneys. Hence, it is said that when the kidneys weaken, the teeth loosen; when essence is firm, the teeth are strong. When there is a dental ailment, it manifests as brittle and weak teeth, which may be loose, spaced, or protruding and hollow. Any dental disease not caused by worms or fire is surely due to insufficient kidney energy, which may result from a congenital deficiency or postnatal depletion, both of which can lead to this condition. Therefore, the treatment should primarily focus on specifically nourishing kidney energy.</p>
<p>Injuries due to external factors, whether from impact, falls, or excessive biting into hard objects, will eventually lead to tooth damage; this cannot be cured by medicine. The wise should take precautions themselves!<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>For toothache caused by yangming heat and obstruction, it is advisable to use formulas like Qingwei San or Qingwei Yin. If the fire is severe, one should use Chaoxin Yin or Taiqing Yin to clear its source. If there is a deficiency of kidney yin, and stomach fire is excessive, leading to thirst and swelling, Yu Nv Jian is the best remedy.</p>
<p>For treating tooth pain externally, only warm and pungent herbs can disperse the heat; recommended are formulas like Xixin Jian, Dingxiang San, Jianghuang San, and Fuyan San. Among these, Erxin Jian and Sanxiang San are particularly effective.</p>
<p>For pain from cavities caused by dental caries, one should use formulas like the Leek Seed Decoction from the Ruizhutang, Ba Dou Wan, or Lilu San, any of which can be chosen for use.</p>
<p>Continuous bleeding from the gums is caused by stomach fire and should be treated with medications that clear the stomach.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>There is also a deficiency in yin below and a blocking of yang above; thus, the six pulses are weak and fine, completely not representing an excess of heat. If blood from the gums flows profusely and cannot be stopped, and if the hands and feet are cold, one should promptly use a calming yin decoction to address this; if one carelessly uses cold and cooling methods, it will surely lead to doom. </p>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing teeth to be unstable—either shaking or brittle and protruding—it is advisable to focus on tonifying the kidneys, but one must also differentiate between cold and heat conditions. Generally, formulations like Left Kidney Pill and Six Flavor Pill strengthen the yin of the kidneys, while Right Kidney Pill and Eight Flavor Pill can tonify the yang of the kidneys; adding bone fragment supplement is particularly effective in pill form. If the teeth are loose or falling out, or if there is bleeding from the gums without foul smell or pain, this indicates yin&#39;s yang deficiency; thus, it is suitable to use calming kidney pills or similar remedies.</p>
<p>&quot;Running Horse Tooth Decay&quot; describes the condition where the gums decay and the teeth fall out, indicating urgency. This is due to the accumulation of heat toxicity. Anyone suffering from this condition faces significant danger. Upon initial appearance of these symptoms, one should swiftly drain the yangming heat and regularly consume mung bean drink.

<p>The method for long teeth: First, use a complete set of the spine of a male rat, discarding the remaining bones and the tail. One part of musk and dried cooked root of prepared Rehmannia must be used. Crush and fry the remaining bones, and make a fine powder, each amounting to three qian. The prepared Rehmannia must be made by oneself and must not come into contact with iron utensils, for if it does, all the previous ingredients will be ineffective. Fresh Rehmannia must also be inspected; if it has been pierced with an iron needle, it will also be ineffective. Three parts of asarum and three parts of elm bark. In summary, all the herbs must not come into contact with iron utensils. One qian of angelica, two qian of green salt, and one qian of eucommia is sufficient, all ground into a very fine powder. The rat bones should be cleaned of flesh and dried on a new tile, ground into powder without burning, in order to retain their natural essence. Place it in a ceramic bottle and at the fifth watch each day, ensure no sound is made. Lightly rub this medicine on the toothless areas thirty-six times, allowing it to naturally be swallowed without rinsing the mouth with water, and continue this for a month. Rubbing during midday is even better, following the same method as before.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Firm Teeth</strong></p>

<p>For shaking teeth: take half a pound of black lead, melt it in a large pot until liquid, then mix in the ash of mulberry branches. Grind it with a willow pestle until it becomes fine, then use fine silk to strain it. Every morning, as usual, clean the teeth, then rinse the mouth with warm water in a bowl; using this water to wash the eyes can improve vision and darken gray hair, and it can treat various eye diseases.</p>
<p>When flesh grows gradually between the gums, this indicates tooth impaction. Take a bowl of fresh rehmannia juice and a few pieces of soapberry, heat them over fire, then quench them in the rehmannia juice, and heat and quench again until the juice is fully absorbed; dry it to a powder and apply it to shrink the growth. There was a woman who often ate foods that cause wind and had a particular craving for crabs. One day, the flesh growing between her teeth became large, making it hard for her to open her mouth. A Daoist shared this recipe, and she was cured. Alternatively, grinding alum into a powder and applying it can also reduce the growth.</p>
<p>When teeth grow increasingly long and it becomes difficult to eat and drink, it is due to an overflow of pulp fluid. Simply take powdered white atractylodes and mix it with water to swallow, and also rinse with boiled water; it will self-heal.</p>
<p>To relieve tooth pain: take one honeycomb from a yellow bee, fill the holes with Sichuan pepper, seal the top with a penny of white salt, and burn it to retain its potency. Add a penny of angelica and sheep bone ash. Grind this mixture with salt to a powder. First, rinse the mouth with clear tea, then apply it; if there are cavities, use the remedy to fill them, and it will heal instantly.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p>
<h3>Acupuncture</h3>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; says: If evil influences invade the Yangming channels of the feet, it leads to symptoms such as nasal bleeding, chilling in the upper teeth. One should needle the area between the middle and index finger nails on the foot, each at one point. Needle the left side for the right side, and the right side for the left. For tooth decay, needle the hand Yangming continuously, and also needle the pulse that enters the teeth, which will help immediately. </p>
<p>Miao Chuan cites that for pain in the upper teeth and cold sensations in the teeth and lips, one should examine the pulse on the back of the hand and remove anything abnormal; if there is a sore spot on the Yangming channel of the middle finger nail and similarly on the thumb and index fingers, needle these spots until strength returns. Needle the left foot for the right side, and the right foot for the left side.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: If there is tooth pain that does not mind cool drinks, treat the Yangming channel of the foot, and the same applies to pain in the upper teeth. If there is tooth pain that despises cool drinks, treat the Yangming channel of the hand, and the same applies to pain in the lower teeth. </p>
<p>If there is an entry path that reaches the gums and involves all the teeth, it is called &quot;Da Ying.&quot; For lower tooth decay, treat this. If there is a cold in the arm that can&#39;t handle cold but is relieved by it, one should tonify; if it resists cold, one should drain. When there is an entry path that reaches the gums and involves all the teeth in the channel of Taiyang, it is called &quot;Jiao Sun.&quot; For upper tooth decay, treat this. </p>
<p>When there is a disease causing cold and heat in the bones that brings restlessness and continuous sweating, if the teeth are not desiccated, treat the Shaoyin channel in the groin; if the teeth are already desiccated, it will be untreatable. The same applies to bone blockage.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; says: If there is swelling in the cheeks and a tightness in the mouth, and one cannot chew due to pain in the cheeks, treat the cheek regions. </p>
<p>For upper tooth decay causing swelling, treat the area near the eyes.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Tooth decay and pain in the upper teeth are governed by the Zhengying point. Tooth decay and pain in the molars are influenced by the Fubai and Wangu points. Tooth pain is associated with the Qianliao and Erjian points. Upper tooth decay relates to the Duan and Ermen points. If there is bleeding between the teeth, it indicates damage to the acidic dental bed and pain; therefore, the gums should not be forced open or the nose pulled—Zhi Jiao governs this. Pain in the upper teeth with a dislike of cold should be treated at the Shangguan point. </p>
<p>For loss of teeth, decay in the lower teeth, and their pain accompanied by swelling, the Xiaoguan point governs these issues. When teeth are unchewable, and the gums are swollen, the Jiao Sun point applies. If there is pain in the lower teeth with aversion to cold and swelling, the Shangyang point is involved. Pain from tooth decay along with a dislike of cold drinks corresponds to the Sanjian point. General oral pain is addressed by the Wenliu point. Decay in the lower teeth can cause pain in the upper teeth, treated at the Yemu point. Tooth pain is associated with the Sidu point. </p>
<p>Pain from tooth decay relates to the Hegu point. The upper tooth decay pain corresponds to the Yanggu point. The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; states that points like Lidu, Sanjian, Chongyang, Pianli, Xiaohai, Hegu, Neiting, and Fuliu govern dental caries. Fubai governs tooth pain that prevents speech. Points like Daying, Qianliao, Tinghui, and Quchi govern painful cold sensations in the teeth. Yanggu and Zhengying govern pain in the upper teeth. Yanggu, Yemu, Shangyang, Erjian, and Sidu govern pain in the lower teeth. Jiao Sun and Jiachē govern unchewable teeth. Xiaoguan, Daying, Yifeng, and Wangu govern pain from tooth decay, while Qubian and Chongyang govern tooth decay issues.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>The &quot;Effective Methods&quot; states: For toothache, apply moxibustion to the Lieque point seven times, and it will never hurt again. Also, apply moxibustion to the Jianyu point seven times, and to the area beneath the earlobe above the jawbone three times. For toothache, measure the distance from the tip of the middle finger to the horizontal line at the wrist, divide it into four parts, remove three parts, and place the remaining one part at the midpoint of the wrist line, applying moxibustion three times, on both sides accordingly.</p>
<p>The &quot;Traditional Medical Compilation&quot; states: The Lieque point is located where the Taiyin Lung Meridian and the Yangming Meridian connect. With hands clasped, find the point at the tip of the middle finger and look for the floating pulse branches between them; apply moxibustion seven times, and the pain will stop immediately and will not recur. The Hegu point is effective for treating tooth decay pain and should be moxibusted. The Neiting point treats lower tooth pain, and both acupuncture and moxibustion can be used. Yanggu treats upper tooth pain, and Taiyuan treats tooth pain caused by wind. For Jianyu points, apply moxibustion seven times, on both sides accordingly. For the area beneath the earlobe above the jawbone, moxibustion three times, and the pain will stop as if by magic.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Truth&quot; states: If there is decay leading to sores, apply moxibustion to the Chengjiang point.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Comprehensive Guide&quot; mentions: For tooth decay and pain, treat with moxibustion at the Taixi point. For upper tooth pain, moxibustion at the Erjian point; for lower tooth pain, acupuncture at the Weizhong point. Additionally, apply moxibustion at the two tips of the inner ankle to treat upper tooth pain. Longyuan is found in the Lieque area along the Qingmai channel, applying moxibustion there will treat lower tooth pain. Chengjiang, Fengfu, Hegu, and Neiting points treat upper tooth pain.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>According to the &quot;Zi Sheng&quot; method, for toothaches, press the area behind the first joint of the thumb, and apply three moxibustion treatments. Initially, the toothache may worsen, then it will start making sounds, and after three treatments, the pain will cease permanently. This point may correspond to the Yangxi acupoint. If the left side hurts, treat the right side; if the right side hurts, treat the left.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ben Cao Shi Yi&quot; states: take an ancient, wide, triangular tile, have three boys of different surnames wait for the first star to rise, and place fire under the tile to apply moxibustion. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jing Yue Quan Shu&quot; mentions: at the inner ankle’s apex on both feet, treat upper tooth pain with moxibustion. For upper teeth pain, apply moxibustion at the Zu San Li point for forty-nine treatments. For lower tooth pain, treat at the San Jian point with seven treatments, and at the Lie Que point with seven treatments, so it will never recur. For dental cavities, treat at the He Gu point. For lower tooth pain at the Nei Ting point, both acupuncture and moxibustion are effective. </p>
<p>For upper tooth pain, at the outer tip of the ankle bone, treat left for right pain and right for left pain, using eleven treatments to yield noticeable effects. Tai Yuan treats windy toothaches, applying seven treatments at the Jian Yu point on both sides, and three treatments beneath the ear lobe at the bone point will stop the pain immediately.</p>
<p>For all toothaches, measure from the tip of the middle finger to the horizontal line at the base of the palm, divide the herb into quarters, and use one part while discarding the rest. Apply moxibustion three times at the measured arm area corresponding to the pain.</p>
<p>Another experiential method: just in front of the ear, near the hairline, there is an artery; treat the area based on pain on either side, using small moxa cones for five to seven treatments for significant effects. It is not necessary to use plasters. If the pain recurs, treat again to eliminate it completely.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; says: Every morning, upon rising, take a pinch of salt and place it in your mouth, then rinse with warm water to clean your teeth. Also, tap your teeth a hundred times without interruption. After five days, the teeth will become firm and strong. The &quot;Zhizhi Fang&quot; states: Among all things that nurture life, none is more critical than the mouth and teeth. Not rinsing or cleaning them serves as a medium for decay. Heat and toxins from alcohol often lurk between the teeth; it is best to rinse and clean regularly for recovery. After finishing the morning wash, rinse, and spit out into your palm, then use your palm to cleanse your eyes, and you will feel illumination. Following this throughout your life can be considered a marvelous method. The &quot;Yangxing Shu&quot; states: The teeth should be tapped morning and evening to gather the spirit. It is said that if one encounters peril, they should tap the left teeth thirty-six times, called &quot;striking the heavenly bell.&quot; To dispel evil and impurities, tap the right teeth, known as &quot;striking the heavenly chime.&quot; To preserve the true intent, tap the center teeth, known as &quot;striking the heavenly drum.&quot;<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>The &quot;Yan Shou Shu&quot; states: After meals, one should rinse the mouth with strong tea, which removes any heaviness and helps to harmonize the spleen and stomach. With meat stuck in the teeth, rinsing with tea helps cleanse it away unnoticed, preventing any need to pick at it. The nature of the teeth tends toward bitterness, and this practice gradually strengthens and solidifies them while also eliminating tooth decay. Rinsing the mouth several times after eating prevents cavities. Health practitioners who habitually tap their teeth in the morning will never suffer from dental diseases.</p>
<p>The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Tong&quot; states: On one&#39;s birthday, start by combing the hair and tapping the teeth nine times, reciting the incantation: &quot;Great Emperor disperses spirits, Five Elders return to truth. Preserve the essence and maintain longevity.&quot; Rotate to the left to engage the moon and to the right to draw upon the sun&#39;s roots. With the clarity of the six harmonies, one can cure all ailments. Swallowing saliva three times is a consistent practice that prevents toothache, headaches, and greying of the hair.</p>
<p>Moreover, another method involves sitting facing east, continuously tapping the teeth thirty-six times, which treats tooth pain.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>Another method: Generally, when a person feels tension in the spine, they should intermittently swallow, tilt their head back, and press both sides up towards the top of the head. Hold this position for a duration, allowing blood circulation and the flow of energy to stabilize before proceeding with further actions. Begin gently, then increase intensity; do not start with intensity and then ease off. If there are no ailments, and one wishes to practice, it is necessary to perform this three times at dawn, noon, and sunset to dispel cold, heat, and illnesses, relieve pain in the back, waist, and head, alleviate wind-dampness, cure mouth sores, and toothache, and eliminate dizziness and various diseases.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: For tooth pain, use the guiding method by pushing and dispersing, then pushing and drawing back. If the left tooth hurts, slide the right hand down the left rib and press it, or visualize fire burning it.</p>
<p>Another method: Wash the kidney water and circulate it around the affected area, using sunlight or fire to disperse it. If it doesn’t heal, blow on the affected area from a foot away, and rub the jaw with your hand, which will lead to healing.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: In ancient times, there was a practice of clenching teeth at dawn and dusk. Although this method is valid, the vibrations caused are ultimately not the best approach. When I have overexerted myself or consumed alcohol, I sometimes sense a looseness in my teeth. I then lightly bite down to gradually align them, doing this once or twice a day, or two to three times, which naturally strengthens their roots. Moreover, when one feels the need to relieve oneself, one must first bite down firmly on the roots of the teeth before doing so, as this practice also helps preserve kidney energy; it not only consolidates essence but also strengthens the teeth. Thus, even though I have passed my seventieth year, my teeth are without a single flaw, largely thanks to these two methods.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Golden Elixirs&quot; states: Nowadays, people rinse their mouths in the morning, which is a misguided practice. The toxins accumulated in the gaps between the teeth throughout the day should be cleaned away at night. By doing so, all dirt and filth are removed, and the teeth remain intact. Hence, night rinsing is superior to morning rinsing for dental care. Observing the wise, they always rinse their mouths after meals, ensuring their teeth remain strong, white, and undamaged into old age; the benefits of this practice are evident.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian,&quot; it is said: A minister from Qi suffered from decayed teeth. I believed that moxibustion on his left hand’s Yangming meridian would suffice, which was done using Ku Shen Decoction. He gargled with three sheng of the decoction for several days, and after five or six days, the illness was resolved. The cause was related to wind exposure and sleeping with an open mouth, as well as eating without rinsing.</p>
<p>In &quot;Confucian Teachings for Caring for Parents,&quot; it is stated: Li Jizhi from Zhezhou suddenly fell ill with tooth pain, frowning and remaining silent. Luan Jingxian saw him and asked, &quot;Why are you not happy?&quot; Li replied, &quot;My tooth hurts.&quot; Luan said, &quot;Do you remember what Zhang Dai said? The Yangming channel has excess heat. You should purge it significantly.&quot; He then gave him seventy pills of Zhouche Pill. After taking them, he encountered several close friends and, despite feeling unwell, was urged to drink several cups of hot wine. The medicine reacted with the hot wine, and he vomited everything out. After the vomiting, the pain stopped. Li laughed heartily, saying, &quot;Dai is indeed a divine being!&quot; However, after three to five days, the pain returned. He took over a hundred pills of the same medicine again, purged several times, and was then cured.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: Liu&#39;s inner wife, over thirty years old, suffered from unbearable tooth pain. Only when riding a horse outside to breathe in the cool air would the pain ease, but it would return upon returning home. The family thought it was due to evil spirits and prayed to a shaman, but she could not be cured. They then sought treatment from a former master. Upon asking for the reason, he said: This illness is caused by damp heat. The foot yangming channel connects to the upper teeth, while the hand yangming connects to the lower teeth; abundant blood and energy in the yangming, compounded by rich food, aggravates the damp heat, leading to this pain. He then established a prescription that did not require horse-riding. Instead, it should allow wind and cold air to constantly flow between the teeth. By combining the bitter cold of Huanglian and the tears of the Chinese parasol tree with the spicy coolness of new mint leaves and the flower spikes of Jingjie, a wind-cold atmosphere was created to treat the damp heat. Moreover, using the bitterness of Shengma to gently guide the treatment into the yangming channel; for the leftover tooth bones, sheep shank bone ash was used as a supplement; a small amount of musk was included for enhancement, ground to a fine powder for application, which was wonderfully effective. Additionally, formula adjustments for the stomach to remove the salt and add Huanglian addressed the root cause; after taking this remedy for three to five doses, her illness was completely cured and would not recur.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Oral Health&quot; states: The elder brother Mao Sanjiang had a deficiency heat in his stomach meridian, causing pain in his teeth. He used the &quot;Restore Middle and Benefit Qi&quot; formula with added cooked Rehmannia, peony, poria, and herbaceous peony, and soon recovered.</p>
<p>The Court Minister Zhang Zhongliang experienced loose teeth and occasionally used the &quot;Clear Stomach Powder.&quot; He felt fatigued, had little appetite, and suffered from tooth pain. I said: This is due to the deficiency of the spleen and kidneys. He took &quot;Calm the Kidneys Pill&quot; and combined it with &quot;Restore Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction,&quot; applying Qianghuo Powder externally, and he recovered. If the tooth roots were decayed and he preferred cold while disliking heat, it indicated harm to the stomach blood, for which he used &quot;Clear Stomach Powder.&quot; If he disliked cold and preferred heat, it indicated stomach qi damage, for which he used the &quot;Restore Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p>Yang Kaogong experienced thirst with loose teeth, suggesting a weak stomach and excessive yin fire. He took &quot;Restore Middle and Benefit Qi&quot; with four doses of wine-fried black yellow bitter, and also took &quot;Modified Eight Flavor Pill,&quot; resulting in immediate relief; he then used &quot;Restore Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction&quot; for complete recovery.</p>
<p>Wang Shiyu had loose teeth and exposed gums, preferring cold foods and drinks. This was due to wet heat in the stomach meridian. He first used &quot;Purge the Qi Decoction&quot; to clear the heat, then &quot;Clear Stomach Powder&quot; to regulate, which stabilized his teeth. He continued with &quot;Six Flavor Pill&quot; to nourish kidney water and used Qianghuo Decoction to dispel external evils, eventually achieving recovery.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Minister Wang suffered from a toothache; someone suggested using wind-dispelling remedies, but it only worsened his chills, fatigue, lack of appetite, and nausea. He believed it was due to excess heat, but I said: the illness was due to insufficient vital energy, and the previous medicine had caused harm. Thus, I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and boost qi, adding Poria and Pinellia, and his vital energy was restored, leading to the resolution of all symptoms.</p>
<p>Minister Guo, who liked to drink, had a toothache and swelling in his cheeks; this was due to damp-heat in the stomach channel. He was treated with the Stomach Clearing Powder, adding Kudzu, Schizonepeta, and Siler for recovery. </p>
<p>Minister Zheng experienced tooth pain radiating to his brain in late winter; this was an invasion of wind-cold affecting the kidney channel. He took Qianghuo and Aconite Decoction once and was cured. This condition can occur regardless of winter or summer, and those with kidney deficiency often suffer from it. Urgent use of this medicine can bring healing; delayed treatment may lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p>Minister Zhu felt heat in the afternoon and experienced nocturnal emissions, which caused his teeth to ache. This indicated deficiency-heat in the spleen and kidneys. I first used the formula to tonify the middle and boost qi, along with Six-Flavor Pill, and later administered the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>Minister Dang had swollen roots of his teeth extending to his cheeks; this was due to wind-heat in the stomach channel. The product of rhinoceros horn and Schizonepeta Decoction was administered, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>My cousin, Yán Qiánxiàn, suffered from tooth pain. His pulse at the right wrist was strong and full. I said this indicated accumulation of heat in the large intestine and prescribed cooling remedies. Due to his advanced age, he had taken tonics for yin deficiency and had been groaning all night. While traveling together to the capital, I prepared a decoction of Cool Phlegm Powder, adding Schizonepeta, Siler, and Gypsum, and after one dose, he was cured.</p>
<p>The magistrate, who used to enjoy drinking, often had floating tooth pain and abdominal pain, resulting in diarrhea. This was due to wine damaging the spleen. He used the Stomach Clearing Powder after meals and the Hangover Relief Decoction before meals, which led to his recovery.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>In the kitchen of Zhong Fuzhai, each time I exerted myself, my gums would swell, making it difficult to chew. This indicated a deficiency of vital energy. I first used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, which healed me, and then I took the Shiquan Dabu Decoction, allowing me to work without difficulty.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Chai Jimei drank well and did not suffer from tooth decay. Occasionally, when experiencing pain, he took two doses of the Taoren Chengqi Decoction, along with a modified Qing Wei San that included Dan Zhu and Ge Gen, and applied Sheng Ma San externally, which resulted in his teeth returning.</p>
<p>A man suffered from internal heat and tooth pain with swollen gums. He often took a small insect. This indicated deficiency heat from the three yin and damp heat from the yangming channel. I first prescribed two doses of the Taoren Chengqi Decoction, followed by Liuwei Dihuang Wan, which cured him.</p>
<p>A man experienced tooth pain and had difficulty digesting food, with his stools being unsatisfactory. This indicated deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, and treatment with Huan Shao Dan led to his recovery.</p>
<p>A man felt heat in his feet and subsequently had floating tooth pain. This indicated deficiency heat from the three yin, and after using a modified Bawei Wan, he no longer experienced issues.</p>
<p>A man had floating tooth pain, dark coloring on the sides of his face, dryness of the mouth, and severe symptoms worsened in the afternoon. This indicated weakness of the spleen. He was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and modified Bawei Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A woman experienced tooth pain due to anger, accompanied by chills and vomiting. She benefitted greatly from Qing Wei and similar medicines, indicating liver fire injuring the stomach. However, cold medicines also caused harm, so Liu Junzi Decoction plus Shao Yao, Chai Hu, and Dan Zhu were used, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>A woman felt a noisy sensation in her stomach, which intensified to a heat-induced pain, and later suffered from tooth pain. This indicated stomach fire generating phlegm. She used Er Chen Tang plus Qin and Lian, and took Xue Jujian Wan, leading to healing.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>A woman experienced fever and toothache, which worsened in the evening, and her menstrual cycle was irregular. This was due to deficiency of blood in the spleen channel; she was treated with Xiao Yao San plus Sheng Ma and recovered. Later, due to anger, the pain returned, so the same medication was used, adding Chuan Xiong, and she was healed.</p>
<p>Another woman had tooth pain along with chills and fever due to anger. She was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang, adding Chuan Xiong, Gui, Ling, Bai Zhu, and Shan Zhi, which halted her pain. Afterward, a modified Xiao Yao San was given, resolving her chills and fever.</p>
<p>The wife of Shi Yangsheng experienced loose teeth after childbirth, which would persist until she became pregnant again. This continued until one day when I visited and discussed her condition. I left her with two doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang to simmer and take after birth, and her teeth did not loosen again. It turned out to be as I said.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Zhi Yan had swollen and painful tooth roots that were unbearable and sought treatment from me. I said: &quot;The tooth pain and swollen gums are stagnant and not moving, which corresponds to the Earth element, and are linked to the foot Yangming channel. This is due to damp-heat in the stomach.&quot; I prescribed Qing Wei Tang with added Shan Zhi and Yuan Shen, and upon taking a dose, he was immediately cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A person suffering from bone cavity wind had their condition exacerbated by medication that let in the wind. Yang fire rose, causing vomiting of bloody phlegm, foul speech, and ultimately they died from not eating.</p>
<p>Another person suffered from external swelling and pain linked to the roots of the upper teeth, with the back teeth also becoming ulcerated and suppurating. Doctors treated this as a tooth abscess, but it did not improve over time, with pus persisting. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that they had previously suffered from extensive sores; thus, they were treated for toxic accumulation and recovered.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　阳明热壅牙痛，宜清胃散、清胃饮之类；火甚者宜抽薪饮、太清饮之类，以清其源也。若肾阴本虚，胃火复盛，上实下虚而为热渴肿痛者，玉女煎为最妙。　　牙痛外敷之药，惟辛温可以散热，宜细辛煎、丁香散、姜黄散、赴筵散之类。然惟二辛煎、三香散为尤妙。　　虫牙蛀空疼痛，宜《瑞竹堂方》韭子汤、巴豆丸、藜芦散，皆可择而用之。　　牙缝出血不止，无非胃火所致，宜以前清胃等药主之。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>亦有阴虚于下，格阳于上，则六脉微细，全非实热火证，牙缝之血大出不能止，而手足厥冷者，速宜以镇阴煎主之；若悞用寒凉，必致不救。　　肾虚牙齿不固，或摇动，或脆弱浮突者，虽宜以补肾为主，然亦当辨其寒热。凡左归丸、六味丸可壮肾中之阴，右归丸、八味丸可补肾中之阳，须通加骨碎补，丸服尤妙。若齿牙浮动脱落，或牙缝出血而口不臭亦无痛者，总属阴中之阳虚，宜安肾丸之类主之。　　走马牙疳，牙床腐烂，齿牙脱落。谓之走马者，言其急也。此盖热毒蕴蓄而然。凡病此者，大为凶候。初见此证，速宜内泻阳明之火，兼以菉豆饮常服之。外用冰白散、冰玉散、三仙散、麝矾散、北枣丹之类敷之。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>

<p>　　长齿法：方用雄鼠脊骨全副，余骨尾头俱不用，麝香一分，熟地身怀之令干，骨碎补炒，各为末三钱。但熟地必须自制，切不可经铁器，一犯则前药俱不效矣。生地亦须看一过，经铁针穿孔者即不效。细辛三分，榆树皮三分。总之，群药俱不可经铁器。当归一钱、青盐二钱、杜仲一钱足矣，各为绝细末。鼠骨，去肉不用，新瓦上焙干为末，不可烧焦，乘其生气也。用一磁瓶盛之，每日五更时不可出声，将此药轻擦在无牙之处，三十六擦，药任其自然咽下，不可用水漱口，一月如是。日间午间擦之更佳，亦如前数。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>　　　　　固齿</p>

<p><strong>On the Ancient Heavenly Truths</strong></p>
<p>At seven years old, a girl&#39;s kidney energy is strong, and her teeth grow longer. At three times seven, kidney energy is balanced, hence true teeth grow and become very long.<br><strong>[Note: For a girl at seven, the kidney energy is robust. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are extensions of the bones, so the teeth grow longer. True teeth are those that fully develop; with sufficient kidney energy, true teeth grow.]</strong>  </p>
<p>At eight years old, a boy&#39;s kidney energy is solid, hair grows longer and teeth grow. At three times eight, kidney energy is balanced, tendons and bones are strong, so true teeth grow and become very long.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: When yang is abundant, the body becomes hot, the pores are closed, breathing is rough, and one struggles to breathe with movements up and down. Sweating does not occur, yet there is heat, the teeth become dry and one feels vexed and grievance, the abdomen is full, leading to death. One can endure in winter but not in summer. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When yang prevails, it signifies the heat of fire, hence the body is hot. Heat on the surface results in closed pores; heat within causes rough breathing. When yin prevails in the abdomen, it causes downward movement; when yang prevails in the back, it causes upward movement. When yang dominates the whole body, there is no sweating and there is heat. The kidneys govern essence, hence the teeth become dry as the essence is depleted. The heart governs blood; hence one feels vexed as the blood is exhausted. A full abdomen indicates that the vital energy of the middle burner is completely depleted. This is the manifestation of death due to excessive yang heat. However, one can prolong existence in winter but cannot escape in summer.</p>
<p><strong>On Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>Those with kidney heat have dark coloration and decayed teeth. </p>
<p>The emperor said: A person suffers from headache for several years, how could this arise, and what is it called? Qibo replied: It arises from having been subjected to extreme cold, penetrating to the marrow. The marrow is dominated by the brain; when the marrow rebels, it causes headache and also tooth pain, the condition is named reversal of qi. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The kidneys produce marrow, hence being affected by the cold results in it penetrating to the marrow. All marrow is related to the brain, thus the brain is fundamental. When the inverted evil of the marrow rises, it enters the brain, which is why the headache persists for several years. The teeth are the remnants of bone, which is why they also ache. This cold penetrates below and rebels upward to the summit, thus it is named reversal of qi.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>In general, when the gums are exposed, it is often due to malnutrition (with worms residing above and below) and lunar eclipses. Applying the ash of grassy plants to the gums at night ensures full recovery; do not eat oil; one or two nights will suffice. Eating oil and dried dates can exacerbate the condition. Thus, those suffering from dental issues should avoid oil, dried dates, and cinnamon bark. Each morning, take a pinch of salt in the mouth, gargle with warm water, and brush the teeth, tapping them a hundred times. This should not take more than five days for the mouth and teeth to stabilize. If a person is unable to eat fruits and vegetables due to exposed tooth roots, this saltwater method of cleaning and tapping the teeth will surely cure them. Many people who suffer from dental diseases often do so due to eating or drinking during lunar eclipses, so the knowledgeable should be cautious. Therefore, during eclipses of the sun and moon, it is especially advisable to avoid eating and drinking, including for young children.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Teeth and the Kidneys</strong><br>Teeth are the end of the bones and are nourished by the marrow; thus, the kidneys are primarily responsible for them. Therefore, when the kidneys weaken, the teeth become loose; when the essence is abundant, the teeth are strong; and when there is deficiency heat, the teeth become unstable.</p>
<p><strong>Toxin Phlegm Pain</strong><br>Heat produces phlegm, which attacks with toxic gases, filling the channels and causing pain. For outward symptoms of abundant phlegm with coughing and spitting, it is suitable to use Er Chen Tang combined with Xi Xin, Zhi Ke, fresh ginger, Da Zao, and Wu Mei decocted. Additionally, use turmeric and Piper longum decocted together, wait until warm, and immerse the tongue in the decoction to allow saliva to flow out, which is effective.</p>
<p><strong>Insect Erosion Pain</strong><br>When individuals do not maintain clean teeth while eating, the foul-smelling gases accumulate over time, causing the gums to have holes where insects erode the teeth. If one tooth is eroded completely, the others will worsen, leading to conditions like gnawing (hidden internal insects). It is essential to eliminate the insects to stop the pain.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>The branches of the Yangming hand channel enter the teeth; if blocked, the teeth feel loose; if empty, they show signs of exposure; if wind accompanies, it attacks the head and face; if there is consumption, it leads to decay.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If a lump the size of a bean appears by the tooth, it is due to fire from the spleen and stomach channels. It is advisable to use a small knife to pierce it, apply Borneol powder, and then take Clear Stomach Decoction or Sweet Tangerine Decoction, all will heal.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Swelling</strong></p>
<p>The teeth are associated with the kidney channel; this condition may arise from wind entering through deficiency, excess drinking causing swelling, blood deficiency causing swelling, injury causing swelling, or sexual exhaustion leading to kidney deficiency causing swelling. The treatment should be tailored based on the specific symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Exposed</strong></p>
<p>Tooth exposure refers to heat surging from the spleen and stomach. In this condition, bleeding occurs between the teeth, associated with the spleen above and the stomach below. If there is difficulty treating blood-tinged phlegm that is abundant, urgent treatment is needed, as delay may lead to severe consequences. First, cleanse with clam water, then blow in the medication.</p>

<p>Some individuals experience pain in their upper and lower teeth; whenever pain arises, they promptly remove them. Not long later, all their teeth are gone. By the age of fifty, they can no longer eat hard substances. The pain in the upper and lower teeth is caused by excessive wind and heat in the Yangming meridians of the hands and feet. One can use medicines like Da and Xiao Chengqi Decoction, Zangyong Pills, or Qu Feng Pills to purge them, and then the pain should naturally stop. The Inner Canon states that all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers are associated with heart fire. Wang Bing said: All origins arise from the heart. The heart represents fire; fire gives rise to earth. It is important to understand the reasons for tooth emergence.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Pain</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from tooth pain due to wind excess that does not heal over time, one can insert a single Ba Dou seed into the flame and let it emit smoke.

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Teeth are markers of the kidneys, while the mouth is the opening of the spleen. Many meridians converge around the mouth; the teeth are where the Yangming meridians of both hands and feet pass through. The upper gums belong to the Earth and are connected to the meridian of the Stomach in the foot Yangming, which remains still and motionless. The lower gums chew food, moving continuously; this is connected to the meridian of the Large Intestine in the hand Yangming. The hand Yangming dislikes cold drinks and prefers warmth, whereas the foot Yangming enjoys cold drinks and dislikes heat; hence, their illnesses differ. The teeth, as indicators of kidney health, also prefer cold; cold makes them strong. When heat accumulates, the teeth become loose, and pain persists, which is why treatments vary.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the onset of hundreds of diseases stems from both fundamental and superficial causes. The teeth are external signs of the kidneys, and remnants of the bones. The stomach&#39;s Yangming channel connects to the gums above the teeth; the Yangming channel of the large intestine connects to the gums below the teeth. The hand&#39;s Yangming dislikes cold drinks and prefers hot ones, while the foot&#39;s Yangming dislikes hot drinks and prefers cold ones, which explains the different types of pain they experience related to cold and heat. If one opens their mouth and feels exacerbated pain, it indicates an invasion of wind evil in the intestines and stomach; if the breath becomes foul and unbearable upon opening the mouth, it indicates accumulated heat in the intestines and stomach. There are cases where pain causes the teeth to loosen, or pain leads to tooth decay, or gaps between teeth inhibit eating—all of these are related. Generally, if the gums are receding and the teeth are loose, it indicates a deficiency in the kidney essence; the treatment should focus on nourishing Yin and supplementing the kidneys. If there is aversion to cold and a strong heat sensation along with foul breath, it indicates excessive heat in the stomach; the treatment should focus on calming the stomach and draining fire. The so-called evidence of wind evil and insect infestation is essentially due to heat generating wind, which in turn generates insects. If the fire in the intestines and stomach is subdued, and additional measures are taken to cleanse the teeth and eliminate insects, there will inevitably be tranquility in treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Tooth Pain</strong></p>
<p>Tooth pain can be caused by wind, toxins, or heat obstruction, tooth decay, and kidney deficiency. If the exact condition is not identified, it is advisable to use a dispersing powder for wind and toxins applied topically. For all conditions, it is appropriate to use three parts of fried sweet fennel and one part of fried salt, ground together for regular application. If tooth worms have emerged, and the cavity is hollow and painful, this is crucial to recognize. It is advisable to use a small amount of frankincense, heated until soft to fill the cavity. If kidney deficiency leads to floating and painful teeth, particularly if there is aversion to cold and a feeling of internal heat, it may present symptoms similar to wanting to fall out. In such cases, it is beneficial to use kidney nourishing pills and intermittently take black tin pills.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Swollen and painful gums, tooth pain with looseness, or blackening and falling out of teeth; the world commonly treats this as kidney deficiency. Little do they realize this pertains to damp heat in the Yangming channel. Though the teeth belong to the kidneys, they arise from the gums, and the upper and lower gums correlate with the Yangming large intestine and stomach, akin to wood growing from the earth. The intestines and stomach are harmed by fine wines, rich flavors, and greasy, sweet foods, causing damp heat to rise. Consequently, the gums become inflamed and painful, possibly bleeding or infested with worms, leading to the discomfort, looseness, blackening, or loss of teeth. Treatment should focus on dispelling the damp heat of the Yangming, thus clearing and soothing the gums, allowing the teeth to stabilize and strengthen.</p>
<p>[Note: For tooth pain, if caused by damp heat in the hand and foot Yangming channels, use Dongyuan&#39;s Qingwei Powder; if due to wind-cold entering the brain leading to headaches and tooth pain, use Qianghuo Fuzi Xixin Decoction; if caused by excessive thinking damaging the spleen, use Guipi Decoction; if due to accumulated anger, use Yueju Pill; if arising from consumption of alcohol and fried foods, use Qingwei Powder; if related to diet harming the spleen, use Liu Junzi Decoction; if from overexertion damaging original qi, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction; if the spleen and stomach are inherently weak, use Liu Jun Gui Decoction; if due to kidney yin deficiency, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan; if from kidney yang deficiency, use Bawei Wan; if both yin and yang are deficient, use Shibu Wan; if there is spleen and kidney deficiency with cold, use Anshen Wan. Mr. Xu Yongcheng remarked: all tooth diseases accompanied by cold or heat symptoms, pertain to the hand and foot Yangming channels; tooth loosening and gum loss, correspond to the foot Shaoyin channel; tooth decay, swelling, pain, and bleeding are all caused by stomach fire. There are also mixed syndromes from various channels and external factors affecting patients.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>Tooth decay leads to bone exposure and bleeding; in such cases, Yuchi Powder should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Cold and Heat Sensitivity</strong></p>
<p>The foot yangming stomach channel enters the upper teeth; this condition prefers cold drinks and despises hot drinks. The hand yangming large intestine channel enters the lower teeth; this condition prefers hot drinks and despises cold drinks. Heat-induced tooth pain fears cold water, cold-induced tooth pain fears hot water; a tooth that fears neither temperature is caused by wind.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Pain</strong></p>
<p>If pain arises from damp heat being obstructed by cold wind, Danggui Longdan Powder should be used. For longstanding tooth pain, with black decay and falling out, relief comes from slightly cooling; this is due to the heat of dampness from rich foods. The Stomach Regulating Qi Decoction with added Huanglian should be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The right Guan pulse is rapid and forceful, or string-like and forceful, indicating wind heat in the intestines and stomach causing pain. The尺 pulse is large and weak, suggesting kidney deficiency, leading to loose and mobile teeth with fiery heat rising and causing pain.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In dental conditions, if there is pain when opening the mouth to let in wind, it indicates wind evil in the stomach; if there is a foul odor when opening the mouth, it indicates accumulated heat in the intestines and stomach; if the root of the tooth is swollen and painful, it indicates stomach heat; if there is pain and mobility, it indicates kidney deficiency; if there are cavities leading to pain, it indicates decay. Upper molar pain relates to deficiency heat in the kidney channel of the foot Shaoyin; use Xiangxintang. Lower molar pain relates to wind and deficiency heat in the hand Yangming; use Baizhitang.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Dental and Oral Health</strong></p>
<p>The teeth are a marker of the kidneys, while the mouth is an opening of the spleen. Many meridians converge in the mouth, as seen with the teeth and gums. Mr. Xu Yongcheng states: Teeth are affected by conditions of cold and heat, which pertain to the Yangming meridian of the limbs. Their mobility and loss relate to the Shaoyin meridian of the feet. Cases of tooth decay, gum swelling, bleeding, pain, and foulness are all associated with damp-heat and stomach fire, or the entrenchment of pathogens from various meridians and external factors. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: For severe damp-heat and pain, administer Chengqi Decoction; for milder cases, use Qīngwèi Powder to regulate it. If there is large intestine heat with swollen, painful gums, apply Qīngwèi Powder; if severe, use Tiáowèi Pill to clear it. For pain due to six stagnations, use Yuèjū Pill to resolve it. If pain is due to deficiency of the central qi, use Bǔzhōng Yìqì Decoction to supplement it. If pain arises from excessive thinking affecting the spleen, use Guīpí Decoction to regulate it. If there is kidney deficiency with heat and pain, use Liùwèihǎo Pill to supplement. If it&#39;s kidney deficiency with cold and pain, use Huánshǎo Dān to replenish; in serious cases, employ Bāwèi Pill as the primary treatment. For conditions associated with wind-heat, use Dúhuó Powder. If great cold has invaded the brain, apply Báizhǐ Powder. For wind-cold entering the brain, use Qiānghuó Fùzǐ Decoction. Diseases are numerous, and treatment should be adapted according to the clinical situation.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Six Essentials of Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>On the Causes of Alcohol and Lust</strong>  </p>
<p>The gums belong to the stomach, while the teeth belong to the kidneys. In middle age, excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust weakens the essence, which cannot nourish the teeth. Heavy and toxic wine gradually corrupts the stomach, leading to a polluted state in the gums and teeth; when they are polluted, they decay. This is akin to how a tree falls if the ground is not solid. When the teeth loosen, it suggests imminent loss. Tooth root pain indicates heat in the gums approaching decay. The classics state: at the age of fifty-eight, a man&#39;s kidney essence declines, leading to hair loss and tooth decay. Once he reaches forty, if the kidneys have already weakened, how much more will they suffer from great consumption? Those who seek life should not place full blame on medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Affiliation of the Teeth</strong>  </p>
<p>The teeth are associated with the Foot Shaoyin Kidney Channel.<br>(Note: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: at the age of fifty-eight, a man&#39;s kidney essence declines, leading to hair loss and tooth decay. It also says: in cases of kidney heat, the color darkens and teeth decay. For those at the end of the Shaoyin phase, the face is dark, teeth are elongated, and decay occurs.) The teeth are divided into upper and lower gums; the upper gums belong to the Foot Yangming Stomach Channel.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that pathogenic factors affecting the foot&#39;s Yangming channel can cause nasal bleeding and cold in the upper teeth. The &quot;Zhenjing&quot; mentions that pain in the upper teeth prefers cold and dislikes heat, and that one should apply acupressure to the original point at the Chongyang point, located in the artery between the bones of the feet, five inches above the ankles. Note: &#39;丬&#39; refers to &#39;judge.&#39; The left half is &#39;丬,&#39; the right half is &#39;片.&#39; Zhu Danxi suggested moxibustion at the Sanli point, which is a major point of the foot&#39;s Yangming channel, located on the outer side of the leg, three fingerbreadths below the knees, about a finger&#39;s width away from the tibia, between the two tendons.</p>
<p>The lower gums are related to the hand&#39;s Yangming large intestine channel. Zhang Jiegugu stated that Qinjiao can relieve lower tooth pain and eliminate wind and dampness of this channel. The &quot;Zhenjing&quot; states that pain in the lower teeth prefers heat and dislikes cold, thus one should apply acupressure to the original point at the Hegu point, situated in the valley between the first and second metacarpal bones of the hands. Zhu Danxi suggested moxibustion at the Sanjian point, which is a point of the hand&#39;s Yangming channel, located in the seam on the inner side of the second phalanx of the thumb and index finger, at the junction of the red and white flesh.</p>
<p>In boys, at the age of eight, kidney energy is abundant, and the teeth regenerate; by the age of thirty, permanent teeth emerge, by fifty, the teeth begin to decay, and by eighty, they are lost. The same applies to girls, who follow the number seven. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the extensions of the bones, nourished by their marrow, thus correlating with the cycles of heavenly essence. The branches of the foot&#39;s Yangming channel enter the upper teeth, while those of the hand&#39;s Yangming channel enter the lower teeth. If the marrow of the bones is insufficient and the Yangming pulse is weak, dental diseases will arise.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block original">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>何以言之？阳明金也，齿属肾水也。阳明之支入齿，此乃母气荣卫其子也，故阳明实则齿坚牢，阳明虚则齿浮动。所以齿痛者，乃阳明经有风冷湿热之邪乘虚而入，聚而为液为涎，与齿间之气血相搏击而痛也。若热涎壅盛，则肿而痛也；热不盛，则齿龈微肿而根浮也。有虫牙痛者，由湿热生虫，蚀其根而作痛也；有齿间血出者，由阳明之支，有风热之邪入齿龈，搏于血，故血出也。有齿龋者，亦以阳明入风热之邪，搏齿龈气血，腐化为脓出臭汁，谓之齿龋，亦曰风龋。有齿(上匿下虫)者，是虫蚀齿至龈，脓烂汁臭也。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can this be explained? The Yangming channel is associated with the metal element, while the teeth belong to the water element of the kidneys. The branches of Yangming enter the teeth, which serves as the mother&#39;s qi nourishing and protecting its offspring. Therefore, when Yangming is strong, the teeth are firm and strong; when it is weak, the teeth become loose. </p>
<p>Hence, tooth pain occurs when external pathogens such as wind, cold, dampness, or heat invade the Yangming channel, accumulating and clashing with the qi and blood in the teeth, causing pain. If this heat and phlegm is abundant, there will be swelling and pain; if heat is not overly abundant, the gums may be slightly swollen and the roots feel elevated. </p>
<p>Toothaches caused by cavities are due to damp-heat leading to decay, eroding the roots and causing pain. If there is bleeding between the teeth, this is because the branches of Yangming have allowed wind-heat pathogens to enter the gums, clashing with the blood, resulting in bleeding. </p>
<p>Cavities occur when the Yangming channel is invaded by wind-heat pathogens, which clash with the qi and blood of the gums, leading to decay and the formation of purulent, foul-smelling fluid, referred to as tooth decay, or called &quot;wind decay.&quot; Teeth that have (hidden worms) are those where worms have eroded the teeth down to the gums, resulting in pus and foul fluid.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are protruding teeth, it is due to heat in the qi that transfers to the pulse, reaching the area between the teeth and gums, causing liquid foam to become pus; when qi and blood are exhausted, the flesh of the gums decays, resulting in exposed and protruding tooth roots. If the teeth are loose, it is due to the deficiency of the Yangming pulse, where qi and blood do not nourish, hence the looseness. If the teeth are darkened, it is because the marrow&#39;s qi and blood cannot flourish, leading to darkened teeth, referred to as &quot;decayed teeth.&quot; The same applies to yellow and black teeth. From this, can we not say that all dental diseases arise from the Yangming? Liu Zonghou states: external invasion of wind and cold, or intake of cold through the mouth, causing tooth pain, are all external factors. Actual heat and false fire, bone steaming and qi stagnation, blood heat with insect damage, are all internal causes. Damage from hard objects is neither an internal nor external cause. </p>
<p>In winter, when wind, cold, and dampness cause headaches, stiffness in the neck, and painful, loose teeth, one should take Mahuang powder. When severe cold attacks the brain, leading to both headaches and toothaches, one should take Xixin powder, Baizhi powder, or Scorpion Tail powder.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

For pain that becomes worse with heat and subsides with cooling, treat with spicy and cooling medicines. If taking tonics for stomach heat leads to intolerable pain in upper and lower teeth, which pulls at the head causing intense pain, this is due to heat from the Yangming channel entering the brain. The patient prefers cold and despises heat, indicating heat in the Yangming channel. For teeth that prefer cold and dislike heat, use Qingwei Decoction.</p>
<p>If there is more cold than heat, the patient mildly dislikes warm drinks and severely dislikes cold drinks, suggesting the use of cardamom powder.

<p>Someone asked: What about an abscess at the tooth root? It is called &quot;attached tooth abscess,&quot; caused by heat and poison in the Yangming Stomach channel. It is advisable to use Qingwei San (Clear Stomach Powder) or Huanglian Jiaodu Decoction to detoxify, or to puncture and drain the bad blood for recovery.<br>— From &quot;Surgical Authenticity&quot; by Chen Shigong (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Dental Disease</strong></p>
<p>Dental diseases can be caused by wind and fire, as well as damp-heat of the Yangming channel. Wind-related pain manifests with swelling upon exposure to wind, followed by pain, which can be treated with the Dispelling Wind Powder. Fire-related pain involves the tooth root pulling at the jaw and cheek, producing intermittent sharp pain, which can be alleviated by applying Ice Boron Powder, allowing saliva to flow and resolve the issue. When damp-heat in the Yangming channel causes pain, the affected areas may swell; in severe cases, this can pull at the temples, causing pain in the neck, with heat in the mouth and constipation. It would be appropriate to use Liangge San (Cool the Diaphragm Powder) with gypsum for treatment. If the swelling is high and soft, there is likely pus inside that should be lanced with a needle for drainage and healing. For gingival diseases that bleed incessantly, internally take Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction, and externally apply Ren Zhong Bai Powder. In children with teething issues, if the tooth root pierces the gum, causing pain like a thorn in the lip, use a beryllium needle to puncture the gum, removing the original tooth with the hand. If bleeding does not stop, replace with damp paper multiple times until the bleeding ceases. It is essential to avoid rich flavors, and the teeth will regrow as before.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Teeth</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: For men, at the age of eight, the kidney energy is strong, and teeth begin to regenerate. At the age of thirty-eight, true teeth emerge; at fifty-eight, the teeth become worn; and by eighty-eight, the teeth are gone. The same applies to women, with seven being the corresponding number. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the markers of bone, nourished by the marrow. All teeth belong to the kidneys, while the upper and lower gums belong to Yangming. The upper gums prefer cold and dislike heat; they relate to the foot Yangming stomach. The lower gums prefer heat and dislike cold; they relate to the hand Yangming large intestine. Any looseness, exposure or pain—whether painful or not, with or without bleeding—all presenting as if about to fall, are associated with the kidneys. The classic states: the heat of the kidneys leads to a black complexion and worn teeth. It also states: when the lesser yin is in decline, the face appears black, teeth extend and become coated. Conditions such as dental caries with swollen, immobile, ulcerating, foul-smelling gums all belong to Yangming. When there are complications from mixed influences or external causes, treatment should differentiate between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Dental Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For toothache caused by kidney deficiency, the remedy is the Ziyin Dabu Pill combined with deer antler. The kidneys govern the bones; when the kidneys are deficient, the marrow weakens. Weak marrow leads to brittle bones, and brittle bones cannot hold the teeth securely, resulting in loose teeth. This can be compared to a broken table: if the wood is weak, the joints become loose and the wood can easily shake out. However, when it is nourished by water, the table is restored and the joints become secure. Thus, the treatment here focuses on nourishing the yin and replenishing the kidneys. When the kidneys are not deficient, the gums and bones are moist, and when the gums and bones are moist, the teeth are secure. This formula includes cooked rehmannia, achyranthes, eucommia, cornelian cherry, five-flavor fruit, and goji berries, all of which are substances that promote yin and benefit the kidneys.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

The flesh of red dates is sweet and benefits the spleen, thus it is used in pill formulations.</p>
<p>When the Grand Minister of Qi had a toothache, Cang Gong made him a bitter angelica stew, which he gargled with three sheng daily; after five or six days, the illness was resolved. The bitterness soothes the tooth pests, and its coldness dispels wind and heat. Later generations, lacking tooth pests, still used bitter angelica for dental hygiene; prolonged use could lead to lower back issues, due to excess. This shows a lack of understanding regarding the affairs of the military and the politics of military actions, as none have succeeded without knowing these aspects.</p>
<p>For toothaches that are aggravated by cold and relieved by heat, the &quot;Tooth Powder&quot; is the remedy. When a person sleeps and opens their mouth, wind and cold can enter, leading to toothaches; consuming cold drinks exacerbates the affliction, while warm drinks dispel the cold and provide some relief. This formula contains Aconite and Chuanwu, both pungent and warming ingredients, used to warm away the cold.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Evidence</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of dental diseases: the first is fire, the second is wind, and the third is kidney deficiency. Each of these diseases has different treatments; once the true nature is discerned, it is not difficult to treat dental issues.</p>
<p>For those with fire-related diseases, the pain must be located in the muscles around the gums, which may manifest as swelling, pain, erosion, foul odor, or bleeding from the gaps between teeth. All these symptoms indicate a problem within the meridians. The upper teeth are associated with the foot yangming channel and remain still; whereas, the lower teeth are associated with the hand yangming channel and move continuously when chewing. This illness is likely caused by an excess of rich foods, fine wines, and sweet flavors, leading to damp heat accumulating in the intestines and stomach, which then obstructs the meridians. Therefore, the treatment should focus on avoiding lavish foods and clearing the fire pathogen.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those suffering from dental diseases, the issue lies not in the meridians but in the teeth, mainly caused by damp heat transforming into tooth worms, which leads to erosion and cavities, resulting in decayed and painful teeth. The treatment should primarily focus on eliminating the worms. For those with strong damp heat, it is also advisable to clear the stomach fire.</p>
<p>In cases where dental issues arise from kidney deficiency, the problem lies not in the meridians but in the organs, as teeth are the endpoints of bones, and bones are governed by the kidneys. Hence, it is said that when the kidneys weaken, the teeth loosen; when essence is firm, the teeth are strong. When there is a dental ailment, it manifests as brittle and weak teeth, which may be loose, spaced, or protruding and hollow. Any dental disease not caused by worms or fire is surely due to insufficient kidney energy, which may result from a congenital deficiency or postnatal depletion, both of which can lead to this condition. Therefore, the treatment should primarily focus on specifically nourishing kidney energy.</p>
<p>Injuries due to external factors, whether from impact, falls, or excessive biting into hard objects, will eventually lead to tooth damage; this cannot be cured by medicine. The wise should take precautions themselves!<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is also a deficiency in yin below and a blocking of yang above; thus, the six pulses are weak and fine, completely not representing an excess of heat.

<p>For kidney deficiency causing teeth to be unstable—either shaking or brittle and protruding—it is advisable to focus on tonifying the kidneys, but one must also differentiate between cold and heat conditions. Generally, formulations like Left Kidney Pill and Six Flavor Pill strengthen the yin of the kidneys, while Right Kidney Pill and Eight Flavor Pill can tonify the yang of the kidneys; adding bone fragment supplement is particularly effective in pill form. If the teeth are loose or falling out, or if there is bleeding from the gums without foul smell or pain, this indicates yin&#39;s yang deficiency; thus, it is suitable to use calming kidney pills or similar remedies.</p>

<p>The method for long teeth: First, use a complete set of the spine of a male rat, discarding the remaining bones and the tail. One part of musk and dried cooked root of prepared Rehmannia must be used. Crush and fry the remaining bones, and make a fine powder, each amounting to three qian. The prepared Rehmannia must be made by oneself and must not come into contact with iron utensils, for if it does, all the previous ingredients will be ineffective. Fresh Rehmannia must also be inspected; if it has been pierced with an iron needle, it will also be ineffective. Three parts of asarum and three parts of elm bark. In summary, all the herbs must not come into contact with iron utensils. One qian of angelica, two qian of green salt, and one qian of eucommia is sufficient, all ground into a very fine powder. The rat bones should be cleaned of flesh and dried on a new tile, ground into powder without burning, in order to retain their natural essence. Place it in a ceramic bottle and at the fifth watch each day, ensure no sound is made. Lightly rub this medicine on the toothless areas thirty-six times, allowing it to naturally be swallowed without rinsing the mouth with water, and continue this for a month. Rubbing during midday is even better, following the same method as before.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

<p>When flesh grows gradually between the gums, this indicates tooth impaction. Take a bowl of fresh rehmannia juice and a few pieces of soapberry, heat them over fire, then quench them in the rehmannia juice, and heat and quench again until the juice is fully absorbed; dry it to a powder and apply it to shrink the growth. There was a woman who often ate foods that cause wind and had a particular craving for crabs. One day, the flesh growing between her teeth became large, making it hard for her to open her mouth. A Daoist shared this recipe, and she was cured. Alternatively, grinding alum into a powder and applying it can also reduce the growth.</p>
<p>When teeth grow increasingly long and it becomes difficult to eat and drink, it is due to an overflow of pulp fluid. Simply take powdered white atractylodes and mix it with water to swallow, and also rinse with boiled water; it will self-heal.</p>
<p>To relieve tooth pain: take one honeycomb from a yellow bee, fill the holes with Sichuan pepper, seal the top with a penny of white salt, and burn it to retain its potency.

For tooth decay, needle the hand Yangming continuously, and also needle the pulse that enters the teeth, which will help immediately. </p>
<p>Miao Chuan cites that for pain in the upper teeth and cold sensations in the teeth and lips, one should examine the pulse on the back of the hand and remove anything abnormal; if there is a sore spot on the Yangming channel of the middle finger nail and similarly on the thumb and index fingers, needle these spots until strength returns. Needle the left foot for the right side, and the right foot for the left side.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: If there is tooth pain that does not mind cool drinks, treat the Yangming channel of the foot, and the same applies to pain in the upper teeth. If there is tooth pain that despises cool drinks, treat the Yangming channel of the hand, and the same applies to pain in the lower teeth. </p>
<p>If there is an entry path that reaches the gums and involves all the teeth, it is called &quot;Da Ying.&quot; For lower tooth decay, treat this. If there is a cold in the arm that can&#39;t handle cold but is relieved by it, one should tonify; if it resists cold, one should drain. When there is an entry path that reaches the gums and involves all the teeth in the channel of Taiyang, it is called &quot;Jiao Sun.&quot; For upper tooth decay, treat this. </p>

Initially, the toothache may worsen, then it will start making sounds, and after three treatments, the pain will cease permanently. This point may correspond to the Yangxi acupoint. If the left side hurts, treat the right side; if the right side hurts, treat the left.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ben Cao Shi Yi&quot; states: take an ancient, wide, triangular tile, have three boys of different surnames wait for the first star to rise, and place fire under the tile to apply moxibustion. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jing Yue Quan Shu&quot; mentions: at the inner ankle’s apex on both feet, treat upper tooth pain with moxibustion. For upper teeth pain, apply moxibustion at the Zu San Li point for forty-nine treatments. For lower tooth pain, treat at the San Jian point with seven treatments, and at the Lie Que point with seven treatments, so it will never recur. For dental cavities, treat at the He Gu point. For lower tooth pain at the Nei Ting point, both acupuncture and moxibustion are effective. </p>
<p>For upper tooth pain, at the outer tip of the ankle bone, treat left for right pain and right for left pain, using eleven treatments to yield noticeable effects. Tai Yuan treats windy toothaches, applying seven treatments at the Jian Yu point on both sides, and three treatments beneath the ear lobe at the bone point will stop the pain immediately.</p>
<p>For all toothaches, measure from the tip of the middle finger to the horizontal line at the base of the palm, divide the herb into quarters, and use one part while discarding the rest. Apply moxibustion three times at the measured arm area corresponding to the pain.</p>
<p>Another experiential method: just in front of the ear, near the hairline, there is an artery; treat the area based on pain on either side, using small moxa cones for five to seven treatments for significant effects. It is not necessary to use plasters. If the pain recurs, treat again to eliminate it completely.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; says: Every morning, upon rising, take a pinch of salt and place it in your mouth, then rinse with warm water to clean your teeth. Also, tap your teeth a hundred times without interruption. After five days, the teeth will become firm and strong. The &quot;Zhizhi Fang&quot; states: Among all things that nurture life, none is more critical than the mouth and teeth. Not rinsing or cleaning them serves as a medium for decay. Heat and toxins from alcohol often lurk between the teeth; it is best to rinse and clean regularly for recovery. After finishing the morning wash, rinse, and spit out into your palm, then use your palm to cleanse your eyes, and you will feel illumination. Following this throughout your life can be considered a marvelous method. The &quot;Yangxing Shu&quot; states: The teeth should be tapped morning and evening to gather the spirit. It is said that if one encounters peril, they should tap the left teeth thirty-six times, called &quot;striking the heavenly bell.&quot; To dispel evil and impurities, tap the right teeth, known as &quot;striking the heavenly chime.&quot; To preserve the true intent, tap the center teeth, known as &quot;striking the heavenly drum.&quot;<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yan Shou Shu&quot; states: After meals, one should rinse the mouth with strong tea, which removes any heaviness and helps to harmonize the spleen and stomach. With meat stuck in the teeth, rinsing with tea helps cleanse it away unnoticed, preventing any need to pick at it. The nature of the teeth tends toward bitterness, and this practice gradually strengthens and solidifies them while also eliminating tooth decay. Rinsing the mouth several times after eating prevents cavities. Health practitioners who habitually tap their teeth in the morning will never suffer from dental diseases.</p>
<p>The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Tong&quot; states: On one&#39;s birthday, start by combing the hair and tapping the teeth nine times, reciting the incantation: &quot;Great Emperor disperses spirits, Five Elders return to truth. Preserve the essence and maintain longevity.&quot; Rotate to the left to engage the moon and to the right to draw upon the sun&#39;s roots. With the clarity of the six harmonies, one can cure all ailments. Swallowing saliva three times is a consistent practice that prevents toothache, headaches, and greying of the hair.</p>

Begin gently, then increase intensity; do not start with intensity and then ease off.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: In ancient times, there was a practice of clenching teeth at dawn and dusk. Although this method is valid, the vibrations caused are ultimately not the best approach. When I have overexerted myself or consumed alcohol, I sometimes sense a looseness in my teeth. I then lightly bite down to gradually align them, doing this once or twice a day, or two to three times, which naturally strengthens their roots. Moreover, when one feels the need to relieve oneself, one must first bite down firmly on the roots of the teeth before doing so, as this practice also helps preserve kidney energy; it not only consolidates essence but also strengthens the teeth. Thus, even though I have passed my seventieth year, my teeth are without a single flaw, largely thanks to these two methods.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Golden Elixirs&quot; states: Nowadays, people rinse their mouths in the morning, which is a misguided practice. The toxins accumulated in the gaps between the teeth throughout the day should be cleaned away at night. By doing so, all dirt and filth are removed, and the teeth remain intact. Hence, night rinsing is superior to morning rinsing for dental care. Observing the wise, they always rinse their mouths after meals, ensuring their teeth remain strong, white, and undamaged into old age; the benefits of this practice are evident.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian,&quot; it is said: A minister from Qi suffered from decayed teeth. I believed that moxibustion on his left hand’s Yangming meridian would suffice, which was done using Ku Shen Decoction. He gargled with three sheng of the decoction for several days, and after five or six days, the illness was resolved. The cause was related to wind exposure and sleeping with an open mouth, as well as eating without rinsing.</p>
<p>In &quot;Confucian Teachings for Caring for Parents,&quot; it is stated: Li Jizhi from Zhezhou suddenly fell ill with tooth pain, frowning and remaining silent. Luan Jingxian saw him and asked, &quot;Why are you not happy?&quot; Li replied, &quot;My tooth hurts.&quot; Luan said, &quot;Do you remember what Zhang Dai said? The Yangming channel has excess heat. You should purge it significantly.&quot; He then gave him seventy pills of Zhouche Pill. After taking them, he encountered several close friends and, despite feeling unwell, was urged to drink several cups of hot wine. The medicine reacted with the hot wine, and he vomited everything out. After the vomiting, the pain stopped. Li laughed heartily, saying, &quot;Dai is indeed a divine being!&quot; However, after three to five days, the pain returned.

Only when riding a horse outside to breathe in the cool air would the pain ease, but it would return upon returning home. The family thought it was due to evil spirits and prayed to a shaman, but she could not be cured. They then sought treatment from a former master. Upon asking for the reason, he said: This illness is caused by damp heat. The foot yangming channel connects to the upper teeth, while the hand yangming connects to the lower teeth; abundant blood and energy in the yangming, compounded by rich food, aggravates the damp heat, leading to this pain. He then established a prescription that did not require horse-riding. Instead, it should allow wind and cold air to constantly flow between the teeth. By combining the bitter cold of Huanglian and the tears of the Chinese parasol tree with the spicy coolness of new mint leaves and the flower spikes of Jingjie, a wind-cold atmosphere was created to treat the damp heat. Moreover, using the bitterness of Shengma to gently guide the treatment into the yangming channel; for the leftover tooth bones, sheep shank bone ash was used as a supplement; a small amount of musk was included for enhancement, ground to a fine powder for application, which was wonderfully effective. Additionally, formula adjustments for the stomach to remove the salt and add Huanglian addressed the root cause; after taking this remedy for three to five doses, her illness was completely cured and would not recur.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A person suffering from bone cavity wind had their condition exacerbated by medication that let in the wind. Yang fire rose, causing vomiting of bloody phlegm, foul speech, and ultimately they died from not eating.</p>
<p>Another person suffered from external swelling and pain linked to the roots of the upper teeth, with the back teeth also becoming ulcerated and suppurating. Doctors treated this as a tooth abscess, but it did not improve over time, with pus persisting.

One can endure in winter but not in summer. **Note:** When yang prevails, it signifies the heat of fire, hence the body is hot. Heat on the surface results in closed pores; heat within causes rough breathing. When yin prevails in the abdomen, it causes downward movement; when yang prevails in the back, it causes upward movement. When yang dominates the whole body, there is no sweating and there is heat. The kidneys govern essence, hence the teeth become dry as the essence is depleted. The heart governs blood; hence one feels vexed as the blood is exhausted. A full abdomen indicates that the vital energy of the middle burner is completely depleted. This is the manifestation of death due to excessive yang heat. However, one can prolong existence in winter but cannot escape in summer. **On Atrophy** Those with kidney heat have dark coloration and decayed teeth. The emperor said: A person suffers from headache for several years, how could this arise, and what is it called? Qibo replied: It arises from having been subjected to extreme cold, penetrating to the marrow. The marrow is dominated by the brain; when the marrow rebels, it causes headache and also tooth pain, the condition is named reversal of qi. **Note:** The kidneys produce marrow, hence being affected by the cold results in it penetrating to the marrow. All marrow is related to the brain, thus the brain is fundamental. When the inverted evil of the marrow rises, it enters the brain, which is why the headache persists for several years. The teeth are the remnants of bone, which is why they also ache.

Applying the ash of grassy plants to the gums at night ensures full recovery; do not eat oil; one or two nights will suffice. Eating oil and dried dates can exacerbate the condition. Thus, those suffering from dental issues should avoid oil, dried dates, and cinnamon bark. Each morning, take a pinch of salt in the mouth, gargle with warm water, and brush the teeth, tapping them a hundred times. This should not take more than five days for the mouth and teeth to stabilize. If a person is unable to eat fruits and vegetables due to exposed tooth roots, this saltwater method of cleaning and tapping the teeth will surely cure them.

For outward symptoms of abundant phlegm with coughing and spitting, it is suitable to use Er Chen Tang combined with Xi Xin, Zhi Ke, fresh ginger, Da Zao, and Wu Mei decocted. Additionally, use turmeric and Piper longum decocted together, wait until warm, and immerse the tongue in the decoction to allow saliva to flow out, which is effective. **Insect Erosion Pain** When individuals do not maintain clean teeth while eating, the foul-smelling gases accumulate over time, causing the gums to have holes where insects erode the teeth.

One can use medicines like Da and Xiao Chengqi Decoction, Zangyong Pills, or Qu Feng Pills to purge them, and then the pain should naturally stop. The Inner Canon states that all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers are associated with heart fire. Wang Bing said: All origins arise from the heart.

The lower gums chew food, moving continuously; this is connected to the meridian of the Large Intestine in the hand Yangming. The hand Yangming dislikes cold drinks and prefers warmth, whereas the foot Yangming enjoys cold drinks and dislikes heat; hence, their illnesses differ.

There are cases where pain causes the teeth to loosen, or pain leads to tooth decay, or gaps between teeth inhibit eating—all of these are related. Generally, if the gums are receding and the teeth are loose, it indicates a deficiency in the kidney essence; the treatment should focus on nourishing Yin and supplementing the kidneys. If there is aversion to cold and a strong heat sensation along with foul breath, it indicates excessive heat in the stomach; the treatment should focus on calming the stomach and draining fire.

This is akin to how a tree falls if the ground is not solid. When the teeth loosen, it suggests imminent loss. Tooth root pain indicates heat in the gums approaching decay.

Note: '丬' refers to 'judge.' The left half is '丬,' the right half is '片.' Zhu Danxi suggested moxibustion at the Sanli point, which is a major point of the foot's Yangming channel, located on the outer side of the leg, three fingerbreadths below the knees, about a finger's width away from the tibia, between the two tendons. The lower gums are related to the hand's Yangming large intestine channel. Zhang Jiegugu stated that Qinjiao can relieve lower tooth pain and eliminate wind and dampness of this channel. The \"Zhenjing\" states that pain in the lower teeth prefers heat and dislikes cold, thus one should apply acupressure to the original point at the Hegu point, situated in the valley between the first and second metacarpal bones of the hands. Zhu Danxi suggested moxibustion at the Sanjian point, which is a point of the hand's Yangming channel, located in the seam on the inner side of the second phalanx of the thumb and index finger, at the junction of the red and white flesh. In boys, at the age of eight, kidney energy is abundant, and the teeth regenerate; by the age of thirty, permanent teeth emerge, by fifty, the teeth begin to decay, and by eighty, they are lost. The same applies to girls, who follow the number seven. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the extensions of the bones, nourished by their marrow, thus correlating with the cycles of heavenly essence.

The Yangming channel is associated with the metal element, while the teeth belong to the water element of the kidneys. The branches of Yangming enter the teeth, which serves as the mother's qi nourishing and protecting its offspring. Therefore, when Yangming is strong, the teeth are firm and strong; when it is weak, the teeth become loose. Hence, tooth pain occurs when external pathogens such as wind, cold, dampness, or heat invade the Yangming channel, accumulating and clashing with the qi and blood in the teeth, causing pain. If this heat and phlegm is abundant, there will be swelling and pain; if heat is not overly abundant, the gums may be slightly swollen and the roots feel elevated. Toothaches caused by cavities are due to damp-heat leading to decay, eroding the roots and causing pain. If there is bleeding between the teeth, this is because the branches of Yangming have allowed wind-heat pathogens to enter the gums, clashing with the blood, resulting in bleeding. Cavities occur when the Yangming channel is invaded by wind-heat pathogens, which clash with the qi and blood of the gums, leading to decay and the formation of purulent, foul-smelling fluid, referred to as tooth decay, or called \"wind decay.\" Teeth that have (hidden worms) are those where worms have eroded the teeth down to the gums, resulting in pus and foul fluid."},{"anchor":"trans-19p","marker":"19p","type":"translation","text":"If there are protruding teeth, it is due to heat in the qi that transfers to the pulse, reaching the area between the teeth and gums, causing liquid foam to become pus; when qi and blood are exhausted, the flesh of the gums decays, resulting in exposed and protruding tooth roots. If the teeth are loose, it is due to the deficiency of the Yangming pulse, where qi and blood do not nourish, hence the looseness. If the teeth are darkened, it is because the marrow's qi and blood cannot flourish, leading to darkened teeth, referred to as \"decayed teeth.\" The same applies to yellow and black teeth. From this, can we not say that all dental diseases arise from the Yangming? Liu Zonghou states: external invasion of wind and cold, or intake of cold through the mouth, causing tooth pain, are all external factors. Actual heat and false fire, bone steaming and qi stagnation, blood heat with insect damage, are all internal causes. Damage from hard objects is neither an internal nor external cause. In winter, when wind, cold, and dampness cause headaches, stiffness in the neck, and painful, loose teeth, one should take Mahuang powder.

If taking tonics for stomach heat leads to intolerable pain in upper and lower teeth, which pulls at the head causing intense pain, this is due to heat from the Yangming channel entering the brain.

Wind-related pain manifests with swelling upon exposure to wind, followed by pain, which can be treated with the Dispelling Wind Powder. Fire-related pain involves the tooth root pulling at the jaw and cheek, producing intermittent sharp pain, which can be alleviated by applying Ice Boron Powder, allowing saliva to flow and resolve the issue. When damp-heat in the Yangming channel causes pain, the affected areas may swell; in severe cases, this can pull at the temples, causing pain in the neck, with heat in the mouth and constipation. It would be appropriate to use Liangge San (Cool the Diaphragm Powder) with gypsum for treatment. If the swelling is high and soft, there is likely pus inside that should be lanced with a needle for drainage and healing. For gingival diseases that bleed incessantly, internally take Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction, and externally apply Ren Zhong Bai Powder. In children with teething issues, if the tooth root pierces the gum, causing pain like a thorn in the lip, use a beryllium needle to puncture the gum, removing the original tooth with the hand.

The upper gums prefer cold and dislike heat; they relate to the foot Yangming stomach. The lower gums prefer heat and dislike cold; they relate to the hand Yangming large intestine. Any looseness, exposure or pain—whether painful or not, with or without bleeding—all presenting as if about to fall, are associated with the kidneys. The classic states: the heat of the kidneys leads to a black complexion and worn teeth. It also states: when the lesser yin is in decline, the face appears black, teeth extend and become coated.

This can be compared to a broken table: if the wood is weak, the joints become loose and the wood can easily shake out. However, when it is nourished by water, the table is restored and the joints become secure. Thus, the treatment here focuses on nourishing the yin and replenishing the kidneys. When the kidneys are not deficient, the gums and bones are moist, and when the gums and bones are moist, the teeth are secure.

The flesh of red dates is sweet and benefits the spleen, thus it is used in pill formulations. When the Grand Minister of Qi had a toothache, Cang Gong made him a bitter angelica stew, which he gargled with three sheng daily; after five or six days, the illness was resolved. The bitterness soothes the tooth pests, and its coldness dispels wind and heat. Later generations, lacking tooth pests, still used bitter angelica for dental hygiene; prolonged use could lead to lower back issues, due to excess. This shows a lack of understanding regarding the affairs of the military and the politics of military actions, as none have succeeded without knowing these aspects. For toothaches that are aggravated by cold and relieved by heat, the \"Tooth Powder\" is the remedy. When a person sleeps and opens their mouth, wind and cold can enter, leading to toothaches; consuming cold drinks exacerbates the affliction, while warm drinks dispel the cold and provide some relief.

This is due to the internal presence of wind-heat affecting the cheeks, where the邪火 becomes strong, leading to tooth pain. Therefore, consuming cold drinks can mildly balance yin and yang, alleviating pain, while hot drinks may exacerbate the fire and intensify the pain.

For those with fire-related diseases, the pain must be located in the muscles around the gums, which may manifest as swelling, pain, erosion, foul odor, or bleeding from the gaps between teeth. All these symptoms indicate a problem within the meridians. The upper teeth are associated with the foot yangming channel and remain still; whereas, the lower teeth are associated with the hand yangming channel and move continuously when chewing. This illness is likely caused by an excess of rich foods, fine wines, and sweet flavors, leading to damp heat accumulating in the intestines and stomach, which then obstructs the meridians. Therefore, the treatment should focus on avoiding lavish foods and clearing the fire pathogen."},{"anchor":"trans-31p","marker":"31p","type":"translation","text":"For those suffering from dental diseases, the issue lies not in the meridians but in the teeth, mainly caused by damp heat transforming into tooth worms, which leads to erosion and cavities, resulting in decayed and painful teeth.

In cases where dental issues arise from kidney deficiency, the problem lies not in the meridians but in the organs, as teeth are the endpoints of bones, and bones are governed by the kidneys. Hence, it is said that when the kidneys weaken, the teeth loosen; when essence is firm, the teeth are strong. When there is a dental ailment, it manifests as brittle and weak teeth, which may be loose, spaced, or protruding and hollow. Any dental disease not caused by worms or fire is surely due to insufficient kidney energy, which may result from a congenital deficiency or postnatal depletion, both of which can lead to this condition.

The \"Traditional Medical Compilation\" states: The Lieque point is located where the Taiyin Lung Meridian and the Yangming Meridian connect. With hands clasped, find the point at the tip of the middle finger and look for the floating pulse branches between them; apply moxibustion seven times, and the pain will stop immediately and will not recur. The Hegu point is effective for treating tooth decay pain and should be moxibusted. The Neiting point treats lower tooth pain, and both acupuncture and moxibustion can be used. Yanggu treats upper tooth pain, and Taiyuan treats tooth pain caused by wind. For Jianyu points, apply moxibustion seven times, on both sides accordingly.

If the left side hurts, treat the right side; if the right side hurts, treat the left. The \"Ben Cao Shi Yi\" states: take an ancient, wide, triangular tile, have three boys of different surnames wait for the first star to rise, and place fire under the tile to apply moxibustion. The \"Jing Yue Quan Shu\" mentions: at the inner ankle’s apex on both feet, treat upper tooth pain with moxibustion.

The \"Zhizhi Fang\" states: Among all things that nurture life, none is more critical than the mouth and teeth. Not rinsing or cleaning them serves as a medium for decay. Heat and toxins from alcohol often lurk between the teeth; it is best to rinse and clean regularly for recovery. After finishing the morning wash, rinse, and spit out into your palm, then use your palm to cleanse your eyes, and you will feel illumination. Following this throughout your life can be considered a marvelous method. The \"Yangxing Shu\" states: The teeth should be tapped morning and evening to gather the spirit. It is said that if one encounters peril, they should tap the left teeth thirty-six times, called \"striking the heavenly bell.\" To dispel evil and impurities, tap the right teeth, known as \"striking the heavenly chime.\" To preserve the true intent, tap the center teeth, known as \"striking the heavenly drum.\""},{"anchor":"trans-106p","marker":"106p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Yan Shou Shu\" states: After meals, one should rinse the mouth with strong tea, which removes any heaviness and helps to harmonize the spleen and stomach.

Rinsing the mouth several times after eating prevents cavities. Health practitioners who habitually tap their teeth in the morning will never suffer from dental diseases. The \"Gu Jin Yi Tong\" states: On one's birthday, start by combing the hair and tapping the teeth nine times, reciting the incantation: \"Great Emperor disperses spirits, Five Elders return to truth.

Begin gently, then increase intensity; do not start with intensity and then ease off.

The \"Essentials of Preserving Life\" states: For tooth pain, use the guiding method by pushing and dispersing, then pushing and drawing back. If the left tooth hurts, slide the right hand down the left rib and press it, or visualize fire burning it. Another method: Wash the kidney water and circulate it around the affected area, using sunlight or fire to disperse it.

I then lightly bite down to gradually align them, doing this once or twice a day, or two to three times, which naturally strengthens their roots. Moreover, when one feels the need to relieve oneself, one must first bite down firmly on the roots of the teeth before doing so, as this practice also helps preserve kidney energy; it not only consolidates essence but also strengthens the teeth. Thus, even though I have passed my seventieth year, my teeth are without a single flaw, largely thanks to these two methods. The \"Complete Book of Golden Elixirs\" states: Nowadays, people rinse their mouths in the morning, which is a misguided practice. The toxins accumulated in the gaps between the teeth throughout the day should be cleaned away at night. By doing so, all dirt and filth are removed, and the teeth remain intact. Hence, night rinsing is superior to morning rinsing for dental care.

Luan Jingxian saw him and asked, \"Why are you not happy?\" Li replied, \"My tooth hurts.\" Luan said, \"Do you remember what Zhang Dai said? The Yangming channel has excess heat.

Upon asking for the reason, he said: This illness is caused by damp heat. The foot yangming channel connects to the upper teeth, while the hand yangming connects to the lower teeth; abundant blood and energy in the yangming, compounded by rich food, aggravates the damp heat, leading to this pain. He then established a prescription that did not require horse-riding. Instead, it should allow wind and cold air to constantly flow between the teeth. By combining the bitter cold of Huanglian and the tears of the Chinese parasol tree with the spicy coolness of new mint leaves and the flower spikes of Jingjie, a wind-cold atmosphere was created to treat the damp heat. Moreover, using the bitterness of Shengma to gently guide the treatment into the yangming channel; for the leftover tooth bones, sheep shank bone ash was used as a supplement; a small amount of musk was included for enhancement, ground to a fine powder for application, which was wonderfully effective.
