      <div><p>Classic Chinese Text: &quot;Collection of Books from Ancient to Modern Times, Volume 381 - Women&#39;s Meridian&quot;</p>
<p>Translation of &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Plain Conversations&quot;</p>
<p>Qibo said: At seven years old, a girl&#39;s kidney energy is abundant, her teeth grow in, and her hair becomes longer. [Note: A person&#39;s life begins with the kidneys. At seven, a girl&#39;s kidney energy is robust. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the remnants of bones, hence they grow. Blood is the fluid of the kidneys, and hair is the residue of blood, thus it grows longer.] At fourteen, the heavenly water arrives, the Ren meridian opens, the Tai Chong meridian flourishes, and menstruation occurs regularly, leading to the potential for children. [Note: Heavenly water refers to the essence given by heaven. The Ren and Chong meridians both originate in the lower abdomen, flowing upward as the sea of menstrual blood, which governs a woman&#39;s ability to conceive. Menstrual cycles wax and wane, thus women also release blood monthly in accordance with the cycle, and when depleted, it replenishes. Therefore, at the time of birth, the mingling of male and female essences should ideally result in children, as being in a state of deficiency makes one more susceptible to conception.] At twenty-one, the kidney energy balances, and true teeth emerge and reach their full growth. [Note: Adequate kidney energy results in the growth of permanent teeth, known as true teeth.] At twenty-eight, tendons and bones become strong, hair grows to its fullest, and the body becomes robust.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The text discusses the physiological changes and implications of women&#39;s health related to specific ages and their connection to the flow of blood and energy. </p>
<p>At ages four and seven, a woman&#39;s blood and energy peak, leading to strong bones and long hair. When blood and energy are abundant, the body appears strong and healthy.</p>
<p>At ages five and seven, the Yangming meridian weakens, causing the face to begin to wither and hair to start to fall out. The Yangming meridian nourishes the face and follows the hairline, so it weakens, leading to facial and hair deterioration.</p>
<p>At ages six and seven, the three Yang meridians weaken at the top of the body, causing the entire face to wither and hair to begin to turn white. These meridians reach up to the head; thus, their decline results in facial withering, and the decline of blood circulation leads to graying hair.</p>
<p>At ages seven and seven, the Ren meridian becomes weak, and the Taichong meridian weakens significantly. The essence of life (Tian Gui) diminishes, leading to physical deterioration and infertility. The essence is stored in the kidneys, and when the Tian Gui diminishes, it suggests blockages in the lower pathways. The weakness of the Ren and Chong meridians contributes to physical decline and infertility.</p>
<p>The kidneys are responsible for water and store the essence of the five organs and six bowels, which is necessary for vitality. When all five organs decline, the muscles and bones weaken, and when the Tian Gui is depleted, it results in graying hair, heaviness of the body, unsteady walking, and infertility.</p>
<p>This explanation highlights the connection between the primordial essence of water and the acquired fluids that nourish the body.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The illness of the two Yangs affects the heart and spleen, leading to an inability to conceal the curving flow. When women do not have their monthly cycle, it transmits as wind and dissipates, or it manifests as breathlessness; those who suffer from this are incurable. </p>
<p>(Note: The two Yangs refer to the foot Yangming stomach channel. The essence and blood of a woman are sustained by the stomach&#39;s processing of food and water, while the spleen governs the movement of this essence. When the two Yangs are ill, the fluids in the middle jiao are depleted, leaving no nourishment for the heart spirit, leading to a deficiency of blood. If the essence from the water and grains does not circulate to the five organs due to spleen dysfunction, the kidneys lack storage and the essence becomes deficient. For men, a lack of essence causes issues with concealment; for women, a lack of blood results in their monthly cycle not occurring on time. This ailment originates from the two Yangs and manifests in the heart and spleen. When both essence and blood are deficient, heat manifests and leads to the generation of wind; the combination of wind and heat fiercely depletes fluids. Excessive heat can induce coughing and breathlessness, leading to death if not treated, for the stomach is the origin of the fluids and the lungs are the source of their transformation.)</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of heat illness:</p>
<p>When the monthly cycle does not arrive, it indicates a closure of the bao mai (uterine vessel). The bao mai is associated with the heart and connects within the uterus. Currently, when qi rises and presses against the lungs, the heart qi cannot descend, thus the monthly cycle does not come. </p>
<p>(Note: The bao mai is associated with the heart; when it receives heart qi, blood is formed. The chong mai and ren mai both emerge from within the uterus and ascend along the back, being the sea of channels. For women, it flows down from the chest to become the monthly cycle. When qi rises and presses on the lungs, true qi is inverted upwards, leading to symptoms such as bitter mouth and dry tongue; if startled, severe coughing occurs, indicating that heart qi is inflamed and not descending, which is why the monthly cycle does not come.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion of the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: If someone suffers from a condition of fullness in the chest and flanks that hinders eating, when the illness worsens, they will first notice a foul smell, produce clear fluids, spit out blood, have cold limbs, experience dizziness, and occasionally see blood before and after. What is the name of this illness? How does one acquire it? Qi Bo said: This illness is named &quot;Blood Deficiency.&quot; It arises from significant blood loss during youth, such as from excessive drinking in a room, leading to depleted energy and liver damage, which is why menstrual flow becomes sparse or ceases. The Emperor asked: How can this be treated? What method should be used? Qi Bo replied: Use four fish bones of the Tilapia, add one reed, combine both ingredients and form pills the size of small beans. Take five pills with a meal, washed down with abalone juice, to benefit the intestines and aid liver recovery. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Significant blood loss damages the liver; if the liver is harmed in women, their menstrual flow will diminish or stop. Energy is derived from essence and blood; when blood is lost, energy is depleted. The four fish bones serve to scatter energy throughout the limbs. Blood is produced in the middle burner. The single reed is meant to help gather and consolidate in the middle burner. Egg whites nourish energy, while egg yolks nourish blood. The pills made with quail eggs serve to replenish both energy and blood. </p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Pivot Classics</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on Pathogenic Qi and Organ Illnesses</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The kidney pulse is weak and deficient, causing a lack of menstrual flow.<br>(Note: Both blood and qi originate from the kidneys; if deficient, qi and blood do not circulate, hence women do not have their monthly flow.)<br>— Essentials of Gold Immersion, Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji</p>
<p>Regarding the menstrual flow not being smooth:</p>
<p>When a woman&#39;s menstrual flow is obstructed, it is addressed with the prescription of Radiant Decoction.<br>If a woman&#39;s menstrual flow is closed and not flowing, with hardened organs causing persistent issues, internal clots of blood and white discharge are treated with alum pills.<br>Regarding menstrual flow not being unblocked:</p>
<p>A woman’s ailments stem from deficiency, accumulation of cold, and blockage of qi, leading to the cessation of menstrual flow for extended years, resulting in cold blood building up at the uterine gate. Cold injures the channels, causing stagnation above, leading to vomiting of saliva, which over time develops into lung abscesses, harming the body.<br>If there is internal blockage, it may circle around the navel as cold hernias, or cause pain in both sides, linking to the organs, or there may be heat accumulation resulting in pain at the lower belly, with a rapid pulse and skin resembling fish scales, affecting men as well as women.<br>When it is not severe below, the cycle is irregular, causing pulling pain in the lower abdomen, aversion to cold in the lower belly, or pain radiating through the waist and spine, resulting in urgent and sudden pain in the legs, knee pain, and feelings of dizziness and faintness, resembling syncope, or emotional distress, with excessive sorrow and anger.<br>These are all manifestations of leukorrhea, not due to spirits or demons. Over time, it leads to emaciation, with a weak and cold pulse. Among the thirty-six diseases, there are countless variations.<br>Carefully examine the pulse, both yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and administer needle and medicine to achieve stability in crises. Although symptoms may be similar, the pulse has different roots; one must distinguish and record them, lest one assume otherwise! The Shaoyin pulse is thin; for women, this leads to menstrual flow being unblocked.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Heat Enters the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>A woman suffers from wind for seven to eight days, then experiences intermittent chills and fevers, coinciding with the absence of her menstrual flow—this is classified as heat entering the blood chamber. The blood must congeal, causing symptoms similar to malaria, occurring at intervals. Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated for this condition. </p>
<p>If a woman has a febrile illness with chills, and her menstrual flow arrives, being clear during the day and confusing in the evening as if seeing ghosts, this also indicates heat entering the blood chamber. Treatment should not disturb the stomach qi or the upper two jiaos; she will surely recover on her own.</p>
<p>In cases of wind in a woman, if there is fever and aversion to cold, and her menstrual flow arrives after seven to eight days, with heat dissipating and pulse diminishing, the body becomes cool and gentle, but there is fullness in the chest and sides resembling a stifled chest sensation, and confusion—this too signifies heat entering the blood chamber. One should needle the Qimen point, taking care to respond to the symptoms.</p>
<p>If a patient has a Yangming condition, and there is blood in the stool along with confusion, this represents heat entering the blood chamber. However, if there is sweating from the head, one should needle the Qimen point, and as symptoms improve, if there is a profuse sweat, the patient will recover.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Classics</strong> by Wang Shuhe (Jin Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p>If a woman experiences vomiting and her stomach reacts, as if she often has shortness of breath (or excessive salivation), her menstrual flow will also be interrupted and if it returns, it will likely be scant. </p>
<p>A question arises: a woman comes for examination, stating that her menstrual flow is less than before; what is the reason? The teacher answers: she has previously suffered from diarrhea; if sweating occurs with less frequent urination, this is acceptable. Why? The teacher explains: the loss of bodily fluids causes the menstrual flow to decrease. If her menstrual flow is more abundant than before, then she is likely suffering. One would express concern about the difficulty of defecation, and she would also no longer be sweating.</p>
<p>Another question: if a woman has three ailments before menstruation begins, what are they? The teacher replies: The first ailment is that when her menstrual flow initially starts, there is heat in the lower regions, which can be exacerbated by wind or fan exposure. The second ailment arises from washing with cold water. The third ailment occurs if she sees red discharge, which can cause fright and lead to illness. This is related to vaginal discharge.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The master said: A woman brought a fifteen-year-old girl for diagnosis, saying that the girl started menstruating at fourteen, but her menstruation has now stopped, and her mother fears it is due to a blockage. The master asked, &quot;Is this girl not the biological daughter of the lady?&quot; If she were a biological child, they should be able to speak about it. The woman responded that she is indeed her daughter. The master said, &quot;The reason I inquire is that when the lady was fourteen, she also began menstruating, which then stopped. This is simply a matter of age; do not be alarmed. It will return in due time.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked about a woman who suffers from diarrhea and has a disrupted menstruation, the master replied, &quot;One should only treat the diarrhea, and menstruation will naturally resume. Do not worry! The reason for the interruption of menstruation while diarrhea persists is that the diarrhea has depleted bodily fluids, causing menstruation to stop. Once the diarrhea ceases, the body will restore its fluids, and menstruation should naturally resume.&quot;</p>
<p>If a woman experiences blood loss and has a dry throat without thirst, her menstruation is likely to be disrupted. This indicates a deficiency in vitality. There is a natural slight cold, thus leading to a lack of thirst. If she feels thirsty and drinks, the fluids can circulate, harmonizing the protective and nutritive aspects, and her menstruation is likely to return.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>On the Regular Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The master said: In the inch pulse, if it is faint and weak, the defensive qi is insufficient; if weak, the blood qi is lacking. When the defensive qi is insufficient, breathing is short and the body is dry; when blood is insufficient, the body experiences counterflow. When both the nourishing and defensive qi are deficient, speech becomes erroneous. </p>
<p>The foot yang pulse is floating and weak; if weak, the stomach qi is deficient. When deficient, there is shortness of breath, a dry throat, and a bitter mouth; when stomach qi is weak, it loses fluids. The lesser yin pulse is faint and receding; if faint, there is no essence; if slow, there is cold within the yin; if weak, blood does not arrive. This is known as the regular pulse, which appears once every three months.</p>
<p>Someone asked: A woman who is three months pregnant, when the master checks her pulse, says she does not menstruate; now, if menstruation is about to occur, what type of pulse is it? How can it be distinguished? The master replied: The inch pulse is floating and large; the nourishing qi is reversed and weak. A floating and large pulse indicates strong qi, while a reversed and weak pulse indicates less blood. The solitary yang is calling out alone, unable to draw in the yin; the two energies are unceasing, leading to a decline in the protective and nourishing energies.</p>
<p>The yin is accumulated cold, while the yang is gathered heat; when yang is vigorous, it does not nourish. The meridians being insufficient and the yin being empty causes the yang to emerge, resulting in reduced blood. At this time, there may be light sweating, a dry throat, frequent and concentrated urination, and excessive salivation. This indicates significant deficiency and fluid leakage, hence it is known that she is not menstruating.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Accumulation of Disorders</strong></p>
<p>If the blood is full and flowing, when the month reaches a certain point in March, the yin is strong and thus flows out, termed as &quot;residing in the cycle.&quot; This refers to the right pulse being strong while the left is weak. </p>
<p>A question is asked: A woman of fifty experiences clear blood for two to three days; how should she be treated? The master responds: This woman previously had no menstrual flow; now, with the return of clear blood, this indicates residing in the cycle. No treatment is needed; it will cease on its own. Menstrual flow typically lasts five days; if it lasts five days, she will recover.</p>
<p>For women whose menstruation occurs twice a month, when the menstrual flow comes, the pulse may seem normal yet is slightly weak. If there is no discomfort or sweating, the menstruation must return in two months.</p>
<p>A question arises: If a woman has menstruation and then breaks out in a sweat, leading to confusion and disorientation, what is the cause? The master explains: The menstrual flow has come down. Thus, the interior is vacuous, resulting in sweating causing the exterior to also become vacant. This is a case of both interior and exterior being vacuous, thus resulting in confusion.</p>
<p>The master states: If the pulse is weak, both blood and qi are deficient; in the young, this is a loss of blood. If there are no other symptoms, this indicates residing in the cycle, skipping three months.</p>
<p>Another question: If a woman experiences a stoppage of menstrual flow for one to two months and then menstruates again, yet the pulse remains weak and thin, what could be the reason? The master replies: In previous months, if a downward flow was expected, it could hinder the menstruation. When the flow stops, the menstrual cycle should resume on its own; this is not a physical issue.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>When to Cut Off</strong></p>
<p>The master said: A woman came, and her pulse was faint and weak, indicating the need to induce vomiting. I asked her age, and she was forty-nine. Her menstrual cycle should have ceased, but it has not stopped until now, leading to this deficiency. The master said: A woman, aged sixty, experiences constant menstrual flow. If she has been ill for a long time with diarrhea, and her lower abdomen is hard and full, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Forcing Menstrual Flow Causes Other Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The woman took medicine to force her menstruation, resulting in pain around her eyes, and she found it difficult to stand on her heels, feeling as if her heart was suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In the left wrist, the pulse at the upper gate showed Yin deficiency, corresponding to the foot Jueyin meridian. The woman suffered from painful menstruation and discomfort in her waist and abdomen. The liver pulse was deep yet rapid; whether it rose or fell, the woman&#39;s menstruation was erratic, sometimes absent and sometimes present, indicating an early loss. The pulse at the wrist was slippery, with full blood and energy. The woman’s meridian flow was poor, and she should take a decoction of (stone salt) and Da Huang to facilitate menstrual flow and needle the Guanyuan point to expel it.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Chen Ziming)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: At seven years old, a girl’s kidney energy is strong, her teeth change and her hair grows; at fourteen, she experiences her first menstruation, with the Ren meridian flowing and the Tai Chong meridian flourishing, and her monthly cycle descends on schedule. &quot;Heaven&quot; refers to the True Qi of heaven, while &quot;Gui&quot; denotes the water of Ren and Gui, hence it is called Tian Gui. The Chong meridian serves as the sea of blood, while the Ren meridian governs the womb. When these two meridians are flowing, the menstrual blood gradually accumulates and descends at the right time, typically seen every three weeks, resembling the waxing and waning of the moon. During menstruation, caution is essential; otherwise, it may resemble symptoms after childbirth. If affected by shock, anger, or strenuous labor, the blood and Qi may become chaotic, leading to various ailments. If there is disturbance in the head, face, or limbs, it results in severe, unrelenting pain. If anger injures the liver, there may be headaches, rib pain, vomiting of blood, and abscesses. If menstrual blood seeps internally, there will be persistent dripping from the orifices. All these six external evils can cause diverse symptoms; if they disturb one slightly, they can develop into serious issues as heavy as mountains. Should we not take heed? </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Blood is the refined essence of food and water, harmonizing the five organs and spreading throughout the six bowels. In men, it transforms into essence; in women, it becomes milk above and fills the sea of blood below.]</strong><a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Therefore, although the heart governs blood and the liver stores blood, all are ultimately regulated by the spleen. When the spleen is nourished and the stomach is harmonized, blood will naturally generate. During menstrual periods, it is advised to avoid bitter, cold, and pungent dispersing medicines, as well as restrictive food. As the verse states: &quot;A woman in harmony delights in having children; in harmony, yin and yang are not at odds; in peace, qi and blood do not clash.&quot; Hence, the text states: &quot;The harmonious qi should appear once every three cycles.&quot; Should one not take caution?</p>
<p>For women, when the heavenly essence arrives, if over ten years pass without a proper union with a man, it results in disharmony. Even if less than ten years pass while yearning for such a union, disharmony still occurs. If there is disharmony, old blood does not flow out, new blood goes astray, and it may penetrate into the bones or transform into tumors. Thus, even when union occurs later, it is difficult to conceive. If there are many unions, the essence may become depleted, leading to disharmony; excessive childbirth depletes blood, risking maternal life. Observing one&#39;s essence and blood indicates that half the problem is already recognized.</p>
<p>The menstrual cycle is a constant marker, indicating the stability of one&#39;s yin and yang and one’s well-being; therefore, each month it should arrive, neither too early nor too late. Any irregularities in timing, such as being too early or too late, as well as fluctuations in quantity, cessation of flow, or continuous bleeding known as &quot;beng lou,&quot; all stem from the dynamics of yin and yang imbalances. </p>
<p>(Note: According to the text, the spleen regulates blood and the liver stores blood. Such conditions often arise from emotional distress affecting the liver and obstructing the spleen, and treatment should focus primarily on these two organs while considering previous discussion.)<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Menstrual irregularities in women can arise when wind and邪 (evil) invade the body and disturb the channels, particularly affecting the Chong and Ren meridians, as well as damaging the hand Taiyang (small intestine) and hand Shaoyin (heart) channels. The Chong and Ren meridians originate within the body and are known as the sea of meridians; they relate to the hand Taiyang small intestine and hand Shaoyin heart channels. The upper part is associated with breast milk, while the lower part is linked to menstrual flow. Menstrual flow is a residual effect of the meridians—if it can be properly regulated, then it will correspond to the proper timing.</p>
<p>I believe that a harmonious heart and spleen lead to regular menstrual cycles. However, if there is emotional stress, external pathogenic influences, irregular diet, inappropriate lifestyle, or deficiency in the spleen and stomach with hyperactivity of heart fire, then menstrual irregularities will occur. Additionally, Danxi states: if menstruation arrives early, it indicates heat in the blood; if it arrives late, it indicates deficiency in the blood.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>I humbly suggest that those who arrive earlier may do so due to dryness of the spleen&#39;s blood, stagnation of spleen fire, anger causing liver fire, heat in the blood division, or excessive labor causing fire. Those who arrive later may do so due to deficiency of the spleen&#39;s blood, lack of blood in the liver, or weakness of Qi and blood. </p>
<p>The treatment methods are as follows: for dryness of the spleen&#39;s blood, use a modified Xiao Yao San; for stagnation of spleen fire, use Gui Pi Tang; for anger causing liver fire, use a modified Xiao Chai Hu Tang; for heat in the blood division, use a modified Si Wu Tang; for excessive labor causing fire, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; for deficiency of the spleen&#39;s blood, use Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang; for little liver blood, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan; and for weak Qi and blood, use Ba Zhen Tang. </p>
<p>Blood is generated from the spleen and earth, thus it is said that the spleen governs blood. In all cases of blood disorders, bitter-sweet remedies should be used to support Yang energy and promote the generation of Yin blood.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Menstrual Disorders</p>
<p>When a woman experiences an interruption of menstruation, it may be due to excessive consumption of food and drink while being intimate, overexertion, loss of blood from vomiting, or damage to the liver and spleen. If one nourishes the source of transformation, menstruation will resume. If there is difficulty in urination, bitter headaches, lumbar pain, and pain in the feet especially when cold, prolonged stagnation of blood in the body can lead to conditions such as masses. If blood and water are mixed, weakness of the spleen and stomach may cause obstruction, leading to edema. If the spleen&#39;s energy is weakened and cannot control fluids, water will accumulate in the muscles, resulting in swelling. One should nourish bodily fluids and significantly support the spleen and stomach in order to maintain health.</p>
<p>(Note: Menstrual blood refers to the essence of yin blood and is related to the Chong and Ren meridians, producing milk above and menstrual flow below. Issues arise from spleen deficiency that prevents blood production, spleen stagnation that restricts blood flow, excess stomach heat that dissipates blood, deficiency of spleen and stomach leading to scant blood, emotional strain on the heart causing blood deficiency, liver damage from anger resulting in less blood, kidney water deficiency affecting liver blood production, and lung qi deficiency obstructing blood circulation.)<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The methods of treatment are as follows: if there is spleen deficiency and lack of movement, then adjust and support it; if there is spleen stagnation and lack of movement, then resolve and support it; if there is stomach fire and lack of movement, then clear and support it; if there is damage to the spleen and stomach and lack of movement, then warm and support it; if there is heart blood deficiency due to overwork and lack of movement, then rest and support it; if anger injures the liver and there is lack of movement, then harmonize and support it; if there is lung qi deficiency and lack of movement, then support the spleen and stomach; if there is kidney deficiency and lack of movement, then support the spleen and lungs. The classics say: &quot;If the lung is damaged, nourish the qi; if the heart is damaged, regulate the defensive and nutritive qi; if the spleen is damaged, regulate diet and adapt to cold and heat; if the liver is damaged, alleviate the internal; if the kidney is damaged, nourish the essence.&quot; All must be carefully examined and treated.</p>
<p>It is initially suggested that when a girl reaches fourteen and has her first menstruation, the Ren vessel is open, and if menstruation occurs regularly, she is capable of bearing children. The first menstruation is a natural phenomenon. The monthly cycle has its regularity. Any abnormalities in its arrival or absence are considered a disease. If the nutritive blood is depleted and unable to nourish the tissues, it will lead to hair loss, a pale face, emaciation, and dryness; excessive dryness allows the metal element to be invaded, which can then manifest as cough, phlegm, lung abscess, or lung atrophy. However, by supporting the stomach and strengthening the qi, the nutritive blood can regenerate, and the menstruation will occur naturally.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>One must be careful with diet, regulate the seven emotions, and preserve one&#39;s spirit in order to attain life. If one experiences violent anger leading to stagnation of qi and an absence of menstruation, one should use remedies that promote qi and break up blood stagnation. </p>
<p>According to Liu Zonghou: Essence derives from food and drink, harmonizing within the five zang organs, being distributed within the six fu organs, thus able to enter the meridians. It flows continuously, is transformed in the spleen, governed by the heart, stored in the liver, spread by the lungs, and discharged by the kidneys, nourishing the entire body. If the yin qi is harmed, numerous disorders will manifest.</p>
<p>The Chong and Ren meridians originate within the womb and are known as the sea of meridians. The hand taiyang small intestine and hand shaoyin heart meridians are closely related. A woman reaches puberty at fourteen with the arrival of Tian Gui, when kidney qi is at its fullest, the Chong and Ren flow freely, and menstrual blood is abundant and descends at the appropriate time; otherwise, there will be blockage.</p>
<p>If there is deficiency of yin blood, one should use Si Wu Tang, Ren Shen, and Ling; if anger damages liver blood, one should use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San; if stagnation harms the spleen, one should use Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang; if there is liver fire and stagnation, one should use Jia Wei Xiao Chai Hu Tang; if there is accumulated heat in the stomach meridian, one should use Jia Wei Qing Wei San.</p>
<p>Kou Zongshe states: The life of a person...<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The foundation lies in qi and blood. When people are ill, they invariably first suffer a depletion of qi and blood. For young maidens and boys, excessive thoughts accumulate in the heart, leading to fatigue and harm. In men, this results in a waning spirit; in women, it causes a cessation of menstrual flow. Indeed, worry and overthinking damage the heart, causing blood to rebel and diminish, leading the spirit to scatter and menstrual flow to cease. Furthermore, a heart condition cannot nourish the spleen, hence loss of appetite; a weak spleen means impaired metal, causing cough; if kidney water is exhausted, wood energy cannot thrive, leading to dry and weak limbs, hence frequent anger, graying hair, and weak bones. Should the five organs be affected, death will follow. One can change their mind and resolve, and with medication to support health, one might preserve life. It is crucial not to use cooling blood-moving remedies such as Qinghao and Chuanjiao; it is better to use Baiziren Pill or Zexlan Decoction to nourish yin and blood and control false fire. </p>
<p>[Note: According to scripture, when the five grains enter the stomach, their dregs and fluids are divided into three channels, leading to qi accumulation in the chest, which exits through the throat, connecting the heart and lungs for respiration. Nourishing qi promotes the secretion of fluids which flow into the vessels, transforming into blood to nourish the extremities and internally sustain the five organs and six bowels. If one takes bitter and cold remedies, they will inevitably harm the stomach, leading to inability to recover.]<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Unfavorable Menstrual Water</strong></p>
<p>If a woman experiences difficulties during her menstrual period, it is due to exhaustion harming her qi and blood, leaving her physique weak and cold winds invading her womb, which injures the channels of Chong and Ren. If the pulse at the inch is taut and the pulse at the Guan is deep, this indicates liver disease, which also primarily causes abdominal pain and sores in the orifices. If the pulse at the inch is slippery and the blood and qi are abundant, it suggests obstruction in the meridians; if the pulse at the inch is absent, it may indicate pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the waist and may cause qi to attack the chest diaphragm. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above symptoms belong to the liver and gallbladder meridians, which are interrelated. They are often caused by emotional distress. If due to wind-heat, use a nourishing liver powder; if due to blood deficiency, supplement with Four Substance Decoction plus sour jujube seeds. If kidney water is insufficient, use the Six-Flavor Pill.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>            Menstrual Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>When a woman experiences abdominal pain during her menstruation, it may be due to cold wind invading the channels and collaterals, or it may injure the hand, taiyang, or shaoyin meridians. Use Warm Channel Decoction or Cinnamon Twig and Peach Kernel Decoction. If the pain is caused by worry and stagnant qi leading to blood stasis, use Cinnamon Twig and Peach Kernel Decoction or Rehmannia Decoction to promote menstruation. If there are blood clots, use the All-Disease Pill. </p>
<p>[Note: If the previous condition is due to wind-cold damaging the spleen, add roasted ginger to Six Gentleman Decoction; if worry damages blood, add ginseng and atractylodes to Four Substance Decoction; if worry damages qi, use Guipitang with Chaihu and Gardenia; if anger damages blood, take Guipitang with Xie Yao. If liver qi is affected by anger, add Wei Xie Yao San. If liver blood is deficient, use Four Substance Decoction with ginseng, atractylodes, Chaihu, and Peony. If liver blood is heat, use Four Substance Decoction with Peony. If there is deficiency fire in the liver and kidney, use Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. If both liver and spleen blood are deficient, use Eight Treasures Decoction with Peony. If liver and spleen are affected by anger, use the modified Guipitang. If qi is deficient and blood weak, use Tonify the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction. If the spleen cannot contain blood, add Chuanxiong and Dong Quai to Six Gentleman Decoction. If the liver is deficient and cannot store blood, use Liver Tonifying Powder.]<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Continuous Menstrual Flow</strong></p>
<p>A woman experiencing continuous menstrual flow has abdominal pain that may be caused either by injury to the Qi and blood from overexertion or by the harmonization of Yin and Yang due to menstruation, leading to external pathogens invading the womb and stagnating in the blood sea. However, nurturing the vital Qi can lead to the self-healing of the illness; attacking the pathogen may instead harm the vital Qi. </p>
<p>[Note: If there are signs of stagnation harming the spleen, use Gui Pi Decoction; if anger has harmed the liver, use Xiao Yao San; if there is excessive liver fire, add medicinal herbs to Si Wu Decoction; for weak spleen Qi, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction; if vital Qi has descended, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; if heat has harmed vital Qi, the previous decoction should be supplemented with Wu Wei, Mai Dong, and roasted Huang Lian.]</p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Cycle Exceeding Its Regular Time</strong></p>
<p>Scholar Xu states: If a woman’s menstrual cycle exceeds its time and she has pain in the lower back and abdomen, leading to menstruation after a full cycle has passed, it is advisable to use Dang Gui San for treatment. </p>
<p>[Note: If the condition is due to deficiency heat in the liver and kidneys, use Dang Gui San; if there is deficiency heat in the liver blood, modify Si Wu Decoction by adding Chai Hu, Zhi Zi, and Dan Pi; if there’s internal stirring of liver fire, modify Xiao Chai Hu Decoction by adding Shan Zhi and Dan Pi; if there is dryness from blood heat, add to Xiao Yao San; if spleen channel fire is blocked, modify Gui Pi Decoction; if both liver and spleen are afflicted by blocking fire, combine Gui Pi and Xiao Yao; if there’s depletion in the liver and kidneys, combine Gui Pi and Liu Wei.]<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Blood Depletion</strong></p>
<p>According to the discussion in the abdomen: There is a condition characterized by illness in the chest and flanks, causing fullness that hinders eating. When the illness advances, one first detects a fishy and foul odor, produces clear fluids, feels sluggish in the limbs, experiences dizziness, and has blood that intermittently flows from both front and back. This condition is termed &quot;blood depletion.&quot; It commonly occurs in youth due to significant blood loss, or from intoxication while engaging in sexual activity, which depletes the kidney and liver. The liver stores blood and receives ethereal nourishment from heaven, connecting through channels to the diaphragm and spreading to the flanks and ribs. If blood is lost and essence is depleted, the liver energy is damaged, leading to the liver&#39;s blood becoming arid and failing to nourish, resulting in fullness in the chest and flanks that hampers eating, thus producing the aforementioned fishy odor and clear fluids. If liver disease affects the lungs, one may cough up blood, feel fatigued in the limbs, experience dizziness, and see intermittent blood flow, all signs of liver pathology and blood depletion.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the previous symptoms arise due to improper diet or living habits leading to a weakened spleen and stomach, one should nourish the source of transformation and supplement with medications such as fish maw and other tonics. If the spleen is deficient and cold, preventing blood generation, it is advisable to bolster the fire of the life gate. Should one take drying medicines that generate internal heat and consume body fluids, it is essential to clear heat and nourish blood. If the spleen and stomach are deficient and energy and blood are weak, one should tonify the center and benefit energy. If the stomach is overheated, leading to blood depletion, it is essential to clear heat from the spleen and stomach. For issues with constipation or if urine is clear and smooth yet menstruation is absent, one should clear the fire in the meridians. If exertion has harmed the heart fire, causing dehydration of blood and absent menstruation, it is advisable to nourish the heart and replenish blood.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Heat Entering the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>When a woman suffers from cold and fever during her menstrual cycle, if she is calm during the day and speaks confusedly in the evening, resembling a pattern of malaria, this is due to heat entering the blood chamber. The treatment should not disturb the stomach&#39;s qi or the upper two jiaos and it is advisable to take Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the pulse is slow and the body feels cool, one should needle the Qimen point, have the patient take five breaths, leave the needle in for a long while, and then slowly withdraw it. When needling the Qimen point, one must drain rather than tonify; for overweight individuals, needle two inches deep, and for those who are thin, one and a half inches deep. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: If the above symptoms are caused by overexertion or anger that leads to fever coinciding with menstruation, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Sheng Di Huang should be used. For blood deficiency, combine Si Wu Tang with Chai Hu. If the illness has already resolved but heat persists, or if the original qi is weak, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. For spleen qi stagnation, employ Ji Sheng Gui Pi Tang. For deficiency of both blood and qi, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang.]</strong><a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Women&#39;s menstrual flow occurs regularly once a month, known as the &quot;monthly sign.&quot; If it fails to come, it is due to wind and heat damaging the menstrual blood, causing it to become stagnant; or it may be affected by internal heat, with weakness in the spleen and stomach leading to inability to consume food. Without sufficient nourishment, the vital energy coalesces, resulting in a dry, yellowish skin without luster. Alternatively, if there is weakness in the intestines, it may lead to diarrhea that drains vital essence, causing infertility.</p>
<p>For young girls whose first menses have not yet begun, they belong to the Lesser Yin. Once the menses have commenced, they fall under the discussion of the Greater Yin; and if the menses cease, they belong to the Taiyin channel. </p>
<p>When a woman’s energy fills the meridians, if her menstruation is frequent and accompanied by pain below the navel, it is advisable to use a combination of peony and six ingredients. If menstrual flow is excessive without other symptoms, add one tael each of Huangqin and Baizhu to the Four Substance Decoction. If menstruation is coming on, accompanied by cramping pain in the abdomen, the Eight Substance Decoction should be taken. If the menstrual flow is significantly heavy, use four taels of the Four Substance Decoction and add one tael of Huangqin. If the blood resembles black bean broth, add one tael each of Huanglian and Huangqin to the Four Substance Decoction. If a woman has scanty menstrual flow but the blood color is healthy, use four taels of the Four Substance Decoction, with one tael each of Shudihuang and Danggui.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Blood Exhaustion and Menstrual Cessation</strong></p>
<p>In youth, intoxication leads to the bedroom, causing exhaustion of energy and injury to the liver, thus menstruation diminishes and does not arrive. Injury to the liver leads to the drying up of blood, and the spleen and stomach cannot transmit it properly, resulting in a significant loss of blood. This causes dizziness and heart restlessness, which is why menstruation does not come; it is manifested by the roundness of the black fishbone.</p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Flow Appropriately Arrives and Stops</strong></p>
<p>For women, menstrual flow should come and go appropriately. If there are signs of cold and heat, first take Xiao Chai Hu to dispel that cold and heat, and then use Si Wu Tang for adjustment and treatment. If the cold and heat do not recede, do not take Si Wu Tang; this is termed a transformation of symptoms, indicating that the exterior pathogenic factor still exists and cannot be effective.</p>
<p><strong>Clarifying Theories</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Heat Enters the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>In cases of warm disease when heat enters the blood chamber, how can we clarify this? The &quot;chamber&quot; refers to a place of confinement. The blood chamber in the human body is where the nourishing blood resides and is the place where the meridians converge, namely the Chong Meridian. The Chong Meridian is one of the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, originating from below the kidneys, emerging at Qichong, and along the Yangming channel, it ascends to the chest and disperses, becoming the sea of the twelve meridians. Wang Bing states: &quot;Chong is the sea of blood,&quot; meaning that the blood of all the meridians converges here. In men, it facilitates the circulation of essence, whereas in women, it produces milk above and menstruation below. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;When the Ren Meridian is open and the Chong Meridian is abundant, menstruation occurs at the appropriate time.&quot; Wang Bing explains: &quot;Yin calms, the sea is full, and blood departs,&quot; indicating that the abundance of the Chong Meridian means that the sea is full. From this observation, we can understand that the Chong is indeed the blood chamber.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>In cases of cold damage (shanghan), for women it enters along the meridians, while for men it is transmitted from the Yangming. The influences affect the Chong vessel and the Shaoyin network originating from the kidneys. When women are affected by evil, it enters through the Taiyang meridian and directly into the Chong meridian and the Yangming of the legs. For men, internal heat of the Yangming allows the evil to enter. When the Chong vessel absorbs heat, blood must move erratically; for men, this manifests as blood leading to verbal disturbances, while for women, it corresponds with the menstrual flow. When men experience Yangming illness with blood leading to verbal disturbances, it indicates heat has entered the blood chamber; this applies broadly to men, not just to women. In women, when the cold damage occurs, if the menstrual flow comes or stops, it is due to the depletion of menstrual energy; the uterus is not closed off, allowing the evil to exploit this entry. The &quot;Divination of Acupuncture&quot; states: &quot;When the evil qi does not find an opening, it cannot harm a person alone.&quot; For women, when heat enters the blood chamber, some may require treatment for recovery, while others may recover without treatment; each case is different.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>A woman afflicted with wind has a fever and feels chills. She experiences menstrual flow, which lasts for seven or eight days. Once the heat subsides, her pulse becomes slow, her body cools and stabilizes, but she feels fullness in the chest and sides, resembling a condition of constrained chest. If she speaks nonsensically, this indicates heat has entered the blood chamber. One should puncture the Qimen point and drain accordingly. </p>
<p>If the woman has been struck by wind for seven or eight days and experiences alternating chills and fever, with her menstrual flow abruptly stopping, this again indicates heat entering the blood chamber, and it is likely that the blood has begun to congeal, presenting a pattern similar to malaria with intermittent occurrences. In this case, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is the principal remedy. Both of these conditions must be treated to ensure recovery.</p>
<p>If a woman suffers from a cold that causes fever, coinciding with her menstrual period, her mind remains clear during the day but becomes confused at night, resembling someone seeing a ghost, it indicates that heat has also entered the blood chamber. However, if this does not affect the stomach&#39;s energy or the upper two burners, she will certainly recover on her own; this does not require treatment to lead to recovery.</p>
<p>As for nonsensical speech, it indicates a serious presence of illness. Why is treatment not required for recovery in this case? Moreover, the chest and sides feeling full, akin to a constrained chest, along with nonsensical speech, suggest that pathogenic energy is trapped within the chest and sides, thus requiring the puncture of Qimen to drain accordingly.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>When periodic chills and fevers occur at times like malaria, it is due to blood congestion and stagnation. One should disperse it with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If there are lingering pathogens present, they must be treated. If a fever arises with menstruation arriving on schedule, clearly during the day and accompanied by vague speech at night, this indicates that with the arrival of menstruation, there are no lingering pathogens left; as long as one does not interfere recklessly, the heat will disperse with the blood and will naturally recover. The text states: &quot;Blood descends; when it descends, recovery occurs.&quot; Therefore, one should not disturb the stomach qi or the upper jiao, and recovery will happen on its own. Reckless interference refers to the fear that vague speech may be interpreted as an excess in the Yangming channel, thus attacking it and disturbing stomach qi; if there is no pathogen in the chest and flanks, one fears to needling the Qi men point, disturbing the middle jiao; if there is no blood congestion, one fears that Xiao Chai Hu Decoction will interfere with the upper jiao. When Xiao Chai Hu Decoction disperses, it moves the defensive qi, which originates from the upper jiao; thus, moving the defensive qi disturbs the upper jiao. Needling the Qi men also stimulates the nutritive qi, which arises from the middle jiao; thus, moving the nutritive qi disturbs the middle jiao. The &quot;Pulse Canon&quot; states: One should not disturb the kidney qi or the upper two jiao; does this mean it refers to medicine but not needles?</p>
<p>Regarding women’s menstruation stagnation:</p>
<p>If a woman’s menstruation is stagnant and fails to come for several months, without muscle loss, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that this is called a mass or stagnation. Stagnation refers to menstruation that is blocked and not flowing; it is urgent to take Tao Ren Cheng Qi Decoction plus Angelica, in a sufficient dosage, and after just three doses, recovery will be immediate. Afterwards, one can use Si Wu Decoction to replenish; additionally, one may use the &quot;Xuanming Fang&quot; Betel Nut Pill.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Menstrual Flow</strong></p>
<p>For women aged fifty and above, if there is a sudden menstrual flow, it is said that the menstrual blood reaches its full count at seventy-seven. Beyond that, a sudden flow occurs. The Inner Canon states that fire governs sudden occurrences, which may also be due to extreme joy, anger, worry, distress, or fright. Therefore, one must be cautious not to treat this as a cold illness. If treated with severe heat medicines, it may be fatal. One may only use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction to clear the upper parts, and then use lotus shell ash and palm hair to filter downward. Following that, use Siwu Decoction with Yanhusuo powder; these serve to cool the blood and regulate the menstrual flow.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>For women who have delayed menstruation, the same is true for unmarried girls. The Inner Canon states that when menstruation does not come, it is due to the closure of the胞脉 (bao mai). The胞脉 is associated with fire and is linked to the kidneys, causing qi to rise and press on the lungs, preventing heart qi from descending, hence the absence of menstruation. One may use tea to adjust a purging powder; after purging, one can utilize Yuzhu powder, Danggui powder, or Sanhe Decoction, Guiling Baizhu powder, and Chaihu Decoction, choosing according to the condition of excess and deficiency. The aim is to descend heart fire, nourish kidney water, stimulate appetite, balance yin and yang, and facilitate urination. Care must be taken to avoid harsh, heating medications. If taken, it may result in lung atrophy, bone steaming, tidal fever, cough with purulent sputum, vomiting blood and wheezing, difficulty in urination, persistent sweating during sleep, progressively leading to emaciation and a large pulse. Even with a good physician, it would be beyond cure.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>On the Three Causes of Menstrual Cessation</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Yin and Yang&quot; states: When diseases of the two Yang elements affect the heart and spleen, there may be hidden paths that become obstructed. If a woman does not have her monthly flow, this is referred to as &quot;wind consumed&quot; or &quot;breath of vitality ceases,&quot; and if untreated, it can lead to death. Women with prolonged deficiency of the spleen and stomach, or who are emaciated with weakened vital energy and blood, may experience a complete cessation of menstruation. This could also be due to heat digestion during illness, leading to gradual weakness and the absence of bodily fluids. The menstrual flow is produced from the transformation of blood and fluids; if these fluids are exhausted, and heat consumes them, the muscles will wither, thirst may arise, and the blood reservoir will be depleted. This condition is termed &quot;blood withered, menstruation ceased,&quot; and it is advisable to drain the stomach of its dry heat and to tonify vital energy and blood; the menstruation will then resume.</p>
<p>In some cases, the menstrual flow may be obstructed by pregnancy, and if the fetus is unsteady due to fetal disease, this can occur. If the pericardium pulse is abundant and rapid, accompanied by agitation, with constipation observed, and even though the urination seems clear, menstruation remains blocked and ceases. This indicates that the blood reservoir is dried up, and it is necessary to regulate the blood vessels and expel the internal fire evil from the pericardium to restore the menstrual flow.</p>
<p>The &quot;Internal Classic&quot; mentions that heat from the small intestine may move to the large intestine, resulting in stagnation or accumulation. When the pulse is shallow and obstructed, menstruation becomes stagnant and fails to flow, which is why it is described as stagnation or accumulation. Alternatively, overwork and heart fire rising may cause a delay in menstruation; calming the heart and harmonizing the blood, draining the fire will then allow for menstruation to resume. Thus, the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; states that when menstruation does not arrive, it is the blockage of the uterine vessels. These vessels are associated with the heart and connect within the uterus; currently, the energy pressing upward onto the lungs inhibits the heart’s energy from descending, which is why menstruation does not occur.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Lesser Yang</strong></p>
<p>For women’s ailments, when menstrual flow is disrupted, all are treated as Lesser Yang conditions, encompassing both cold and miscellaneous diseases. The classic texts state: when the body is ill and there is an external pathogen, the meridians are obstructed. Moreover, if the monthly cycle does not come, it signifies obstruction in the conception vessels. In cases where menstruation is obstructed, the pulse at the wrist fails to show, and when the conception vessel is obstructed, the source of life is cut off; both scenarios involve blood disorders, which are under the domain of the Jueyin. If one suffers from a Jueyin condition, it then becomes a Lesser Yang condition, and this can affect the husband as well. </p>
<p>The methods of treatment may involve creating intense heat or transforming into exhaustion; the pulse may exhibit both superficial and deep characteristics, requiring differing herbs for interior and exterior harmonization. One must assess whether the issues reside in qi or blood, and determine if they address Yin or Yang. It is essential that the dosages for both large and small are appropriately balanced, with light and heavy matters serving their place, considering reversals and urgency, managing everything without error, thus achieving total wellness. This method of treating Lesser Yang is vital knowledge.</p>
<p>In treating miscellaneous diseases, one must first harmonize the qi, followed by addressing various ailments, ensuring that the stomach qi remains unharmed—which is critical. If blood is affected, qi must still be adjusted first, as unharmonized qi means blood cannot circulate. Qi serves as the fundamental substance; it is like the husband. If the husband does not sing, the wife will not follow. Therefore, for women’s menstrual disorders, one begins with Chaihu to regulate the exterior of the menstrual cycle and then follows with the Four Substances to nourish the interior, prioritizing qi before blood.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Method for Imbalance in Women</strong></p>
<p>When a woman has an irregular menstrual flow, and the right pulse at the wrist feels empty, this indicates a loss of both qi and blood, resulting in a cold condition. If the pulse is rapid and quick with a tense or weak feeling, it suggests a deficiency of yang, and the yin fire is also diminished. If there are signs of heat in the mouth, nose, eyes, or thirst, this indicates yin agitation and the desire for yang to depart. In this case, one should warm and reduce, drawing out the dryness, using the Shengyang Jujing Decoction. This method greatly elevates and replenishes the floating blood and qi, replenishing the deficiency in the life gate below.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment for Heat Entering the Blood Chamber</h3>
<p>During the day, clarity prevails; at night, there are incoherent words. Heat enters the blood chamber, but does not violate the stomach qi and the two upper jiaos; it can heal on its own. If severe, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction, or Peach Kernel Decoction for situations that resemble the condition described.<br>— Danxi&#39;s Heart Method (Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<h3>Treatment for Menstrual Disorders</h3>
<p>For women whose menstruation is overdue, the blood may be stagnant; use Four Substances with Ginseng and Atractylodes. If there is phlegm, add South Star, Pinellia, and Dried Citrus Peel. If menstruation arrives before the expected time, it is due to blood heat; use Four Substances with Coptis. If overdue and the blood is dark purple with clots, it is also due to blood heat and will likely cause pain; use Four Substances with Cyperus and Coptis. If overdue and the color is pale, there is excess phlegm; use Two Aged Herbs with Chuanxiong and Angelica. If it arrives overdue, it indicates blood deficiency; it is advisable to tonify the blood with Four Substances, adding Astragalus, Dried Citrus Peel, and Cimicifuga. If it arrives early, both qi and blood are hot; it is advised to cool the qi and blood using Chaihu, Huangqin, Angelica, White Peony, Rehmannia, and similar herbs. If menstruation is irregular and the blood color is pale, tonify qi and blood using Ginseng, Astragalus, Chuanxiong, Angelica, plus Cyperus and White Peony; for abdominal pain, add Gelatin Pearl, Mugwort, and Corydalis.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>When pain occurs after the menstrual period, it is due to heat within the deficiency, which causes the pain. If pain occurs just before the menstrual flow, it indicates that the blood is abundant. [Some say it is due to Qi stagnation.] For treatment, use the four substance formula with the addition of peach kernel and coptis. If there is lower back and abdominal pain before the onset of menstruation, it is due to stagnation and the presence of stagnant blood; in this case, it is advisable to use the four substance formula with safflower, peach kernel, curcuma, yan hu suo, cyperus, and wood fragrance. If there is fever, add scutellaria and bupleurum. If there are purple spots, it indicates heat; in this case, add coptis and bupleurum to the four substance formula. </p>
<p>If there is an excessive amount of phlegm occupying the blood sea position, then one will gradually experience vision deterioration. For obese individuals with this condition, use nux vomica, aster, ligusticum wallichii, and cyperus, making them into pills to be taken. If an obese person has an excessive amount before their due time, it indicates excessive phlegm and blood deficiency with heat; use the previous pill formula and additionally include coptis and white atractylodes. </p>
<p>For those with blood depletion resulting in amenorrhea, use the four substance formula with the addition of peach kernel and safflower.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>For a person with an excess of body fat and a closed menstrual cycle, use a phlegm-dissolving decoction with added Huanglian and Chuanxiong. Avoid using Dihuang, as it can lead to stagnation. If prepared with ginger juice, it becomes more adverse. </p>
<p>For those who are overweight and have irregular menstrual flow due to excessive damp phlegm, the recommended ingredients are Cangzhu, Banxia, Huashi, Fuling, Baizhu, Xiangfu, Chuanxiong, and Danggui. </p>
<p>For those who experience abdominal pain when menstruation approaches, use the Siwu Decoction with added Chenpi, Yanhusuo, Mudanpi, and Licorice. For severe pain, use Doulin wine; for milder pain, boil Shagen (a type of grass root) in children&#39;s urine and incorporate fried Qiaoqing powder into pills. </p>
<p>If menstruation is excessive and difficult to control, use Sanbu Pills with Shagen, Gui Ban, and Jinmao Goujizi. </p>
<p>For those with a long-lasting deficiency in the Yin and blocked meridians, experiencing frequent urination and bodily pain, incorporate Siwu Decoction with Cangzhu, Niuxi, Chenpi, and raw Licorice; additionally, use Cangsha Pills combined with Canger.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>When using wine and peony root to make pills, swallow them before brewing the medicine. If the menstruation is slightly delayed, and gradually becomes obstructed, with discomfort in the hands and feet, increasing thinness and hot flashes, and a weak, rapid pulse, modify the Four Substance Decoction by removing cooked Rehmannia and adding three times the amount of ligusticum, along with half a part of licorice. </p>
<p>If the menstrual flow is excessive, modify the Four Substance Decoction by removing cooked Rehmannia and adding raw Rehmannia, or simply add Scutellaria and Atractylodes. </p>
<p>If there are body heat and a rapid pulse during the menstrual period, along with dizziness, add Chaihu and Scutellaria to the Four Substance Decoction. </p>
<p>If the menstrual flow is slightly reduced, accompanied by distention or pain, and pain in the limbs, add Yanhusuo, myrrh, and angelica dahurica as a powder to the Four Substance Decoction, mixing it with a light vinegar decoction. </p>
<p>If the menstrual cycle is irregular and there is pain in the heart and abdomen, use only the two herbs, ligusticum and angelica, known as the monarch-minister powder. </p>
<p>If menstrual onset is accompanied by cramping pain in the lower abdomen, add Yanhusuo, areca nut, and half the amount of fried neem, along with wood incense. </p>
<p>If the menstrual flow is scant, add sunflower and safflower to the Four Substance Decoction.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>When menstruation is delayed and pain occurs, it indicates deficiency of both qi and blood, and one should take the Four Substances Decoction paired with the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If the menstrual blood is pale, it also indicates deficiency of qi and blood, and one should use something like the Eight Substances Decoction. The Eight Substances include the Four Substances and the Four Gentlemen. If there are accompanying symptoms, additional herbs should be added according to those symptoms.</p>
<p>The causes of menstrual irregularities can be either occurring earlier or later, or having more or less blood flow. Generally, pain occurring after menstruation indicates deficiency; if the flow is light and pale, it denotes blood deficiency; if it’s heavy, it reflects qi deficiency. Pain that will occur and does not resolve indicates stagnation, while dark purple or black blood indicates stagnation with accompanying heat. </p>
<p>Menstrual blood may come earlier or later, in greater or lesser amounts, or may come once a month or twice in a month; these are all signs of irregularities. Treatment should aim to regulate and disperse the menstruation. </p>
<p>For irregular menstrual cycles, the main treatment should be the Four Substances Decoction. Among those with menstrual irregularities, some may also experience pain, fever, early menstruation, or delayed menstruation. Early menstruation indicates heat, while delayed menstruation indicates deficiency. Pain can occur consistently or just before and after menstruation; consistent pain and pain before menstruation indicate blood accumulation, while pain after menstruation indicates blood deficiency. </p>
<p>Among those who experience fever, some may have constant fevers, while others may have fevers during menstruation; constant fevers indicate blood deficiency with accumulation, while fevers during menstruation indicate blood deficiency with heat. </p>
<p>If menstrual flow is scant, it indicates either deficiency or a thin flow; deficiency requires supplementation, while thin flow requires assistance.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>On the Distinction of Purple and Black Painful Masses</strong></p>
<p>The menstrual flow is associated with Yin blood. Yin must derive from Yang, hence it is red, which embodies the color of fire. Blood is paired with Qi; when Qi is hot, it becomes hot, and when Qi is cold, it becomes cold. When Qi rises, it rises; when it descends, it descends; when Qi condenses, it condenses; when Qi stagnates, it stagnates; when Qi is clear, it is clear; when Qi is turbid, it is turbid. Often, masses are seen to form due to the condensation of Qi. Pain that occurs upon movement is due to the stagnation of Qi. Pain that arises afterward indicates deficiency in both Qi and blood. A pale color also signifies deficiency. Erratic movement of the menstrual flow indicates chaotic Qi. Purple indicates hot Qi, while black indicates extreme heat. People often see the purple, black, painful masses and hastily attribute them to wind and cold, treating them with warming remedies, leading to disaster. This is likely due to the theory in &quot;Sources of Disease,&quot; which states that all monthly conditions are said to be caused by wind and cold, making it a common practice. </p>
<p>Some say: Black is the color of northern water, and purple is lighter than black; how can it not be cold? I respond: The classics state that excess causes harm, and holding onto it must be controlled. When heat is excessive, it must also be accompanied by the transformation of water, thus the heat appears purple and extreme heat appears black. Moreover, women are inherently more reclusive and possess heightened desires; the yang fire of their organs is constantly active. How can this not be heat? As for wind and cold, they must be obtained from the outside; if they are present, it is but one in a thousand or one in two.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>On the Illness of the Two Yangs</strong></p>
<p>The text says: &quot;The illness of the two Yangs affects the heart and spleen, causing inability to conceal and resulting in women not menstruating.&quot; Those who explain this state that for men, the spleen is affected, leading to insufficient essence; for women, the heart is affected, causing a lack of menstrual flow. They divide the heart and spleen to argue that each gender has a distinct cause.</p>
<p>I privately disagree with this interpretation. The term &quot;two Yangs&quot; refers to Yangming, which pertains to the stomach and large intestine channels. When there is illness in the intestines and stomach, it affects the heart and spleen. &quot;Affecting the heart and spleen&quot; means that the influence extends to these organs. Indeed, the spleen and stomach are interrelated, so when there is a stomach ailment, it naturally impacts the spleen. However, the large intestine and heart are not usually interconnected; thus, why does a large intestine issue impact the heart? This is because the stomach is the organ of reception, while the large intestine is the organ of transformation and transmission.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Food enters the stomach, and the turbid qi returns to the heart; drink enters the stomach and is processed by the spleen. This is due to the stomach’s ability to receive and the intestines’ ability to transform. When the intestines and stomach are ill, they cannot receive or transform, and what then can the heart and spleen depend on? Once the heart and spleen have no resources to depend on, they cannot function to produce vital essence and blood. Thus, when the intestines and stomach are sick, the heart and spleen are affected, leading to men having low sperm production and women having irregular menstrual cycles. </p>
<p>The heart and spleen should be considered together; one should not divide the discussion by gender. Only in cases of hidden menstrual irregularities can one speak separately about men and women. If we follow the claims made by some monks, it suggests that male essence relies solely on the spleen and not on the heart, while female blood relies solely on the heart and not on the spleen. Is there any validity in this? In truth, both male essence and female blood are nourished through the balance of the five viscera and six bowels before they are formed, so can we really say that male essence relies on the spleen and female blood relies on the heart? The classics state that both men and women may suffer from heart and spleen diseases, but in men, this manifests as hidden issues affecting fertility, while in women, this presents as the absence of menstrual flow.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong> (Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi)</p>
<p><strong>Heat Enters the Blood Chamber, Resulting in Chest Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What causes heat to enter the blood chamber and result in chest accumulation? I replied: The pathogenic qi enters the meridians as the master, causing the energies to clash and flow up and down. When it meets the menstrual flow, it disrupts it; the pathogenic qi then takes advantage of the weakness to enter the blood chamber. The blood, being forced by the pathogenic influence, enters the liver meridian. When the liver is affected by the pathogen, it leads to speech difficulties and hallucinatory experiences. This further enters the diaphragm, causing blood to accumulate in the chest. How do I explain this? A woman, in her normal state, has water nourishing wood and blood nourishing the liver. Before conception, this blood serves as menstruation; once pregnant, it is reserved to nurture the fetus. After giving birth, it is transformed to produce milk. All of these functions depend on blood. Now, when the pathogen drives out the blood and it returns to the liver meridian, it accumulates in the diaphragm and solidifies beneath the breast, hence causing pain upon touch. This condition cannot be treated with medicine; therefore, the point to be needled is Qimen.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p>
<h3>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Ming - Dai Sigong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Irregularities</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s menstrual flow should arrive punctually each month, not exceeding or lacking, similar to the deficiency of the Yin. If it comes either early or late, or is too scanty or excessive, or if there is pain before or during menstruation, these are all referred to as irregularities. The remedy for this includes herbal formulas to harmonize Qi, such as Heqi Decoction with half a qian of Xiangfuzi, and adding Yandu Pill. If menstruation arrives with abdominal pain, or if there is abdominal pain without menstruation, both are due to the disharmony of blood. To remedy blood imbalance, one must first regulate Qi. The Siwu Decoction with half a qian of Wuzhuyu and one qian of Xiangfuzi may be used, along with Heqi Decoction with half a qian of Zhuyujie. For severe pain, Yan Hu Suo Decoction is recommended. However, care must be taken to guard against external pathogens or dietary causes of pain, especially if the pain is not due to blood. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a detailed examination, and Heqi Decoction can also treat the accompanying conditions.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Due to fear and anxiety causing qi to rise, resulting in the moon not flowing smoothly, excessive phlegm, and a muddled spirit, one may become unaware of their own person; or they might speak erratically, laugh, appearing mad, like one afflicted with five kinds of tremors, yet seem perfectly sane when awake; or when ill, the body feels as if it is shaking, with hands and feet twitching. Administer a mixture of &quot;Four Seven Decoction&quot; and &quot;Great Warmth Classic Decoction&quot; in equal parts, properly combined and consumed. </p>
<p>For those who miss their menstrual period or have symptoms appearing after two or three months, one should use Gui Zhi Decoction as it stirs the blood. Modify this decoction by adding half a coin each of Su Mu, Hong Hua, and Gan Qi—add a penny of Tao Ren, and either vinegar or wine to boil away the dregs, with a little musk added, and then mix it with vinegar to prepare Heishen Powder. </p>
<p>If there are lumps in the abdomen due to blood stasis, modify the Si Wu Decoction by removing Di Huang and adding half a coin each of Guan Gui and Bai Zhu. </p>
<p>For menstrual irregularities with blood not following its proper path, manifesting after bowel movements, causing abdominal pain or not, do not treat it like ordinary blood in stool; instead, one should follow the menstrual cycle. Use Si Wu Decoction, removing Di Huang and adding one penny each of Ejiao and Xiang Fu, then mix with Heishen Powder to adjust qi, taking it with clear soup as a remedy.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise: Adjusting the Menstrual Cycle</strong></p>
<p>The way before conception begins is to seek a child. The method for seeking a child must start with regulating the menstrual cycle. Whenever I observe women who are childless, their menstruation is often irregular—either early or late, too much or too little, accompanied by pain before or after menstruation, and the color could be purple, black, or pale, or the flow is thick and unregulated. If the cycle is unregulated, then the blood and vital energy conflict and cannot achieve conception. </p>
<p>Let us explore the causes of this lack of regulation: if the cycle is early or late, accompanied by pain after menstruation, it indicates deficiency; if the flow is scanty and pale, it signifies blood deficiency; if it is excessive, it points to Qi deficiency; if there is pain before the cycle and clots that do not disperse, it signifies stagnation. If the color is purple or black, it indicates stagnation combined with heat. </p>
<p>The treatment methods are as follows: for blood deficiency, one should use the Four Substances Decoction; for Qi deficiency, the same plus ginseng and astragalus; for stagnation, one may use Xiangfu, Sande, Muxiang, Bitao, Taoren, and Yanhuhua. For prolonged stagnation that has become entrenched, methods such as vomiting or purging may be necessary. For those with a pulse and symptoms of heat, add Huangqin and Lian; for those with a pulse and symptoms of cold, add Gui, Fu, and varieties of quartz. Only after removing stagnation and restoring deficiency can blood and Qi harmonize, allowing for conception.</p>
<p>Whenever I treat cases of irregular menstruation, just one ingredient, powdered Xiangfu, formed into pills and taken, achieves consistent success.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The menstrual flow may occur either sooner or later. </p>
<p>Women often experience irregularities in their menstruation, with periods that vary from heavy to light, or that arrive early or late, accompanied by pains. Physicians typically refer to this as menstrual illness, without distinguishing whether yin is overpowering yang or vice versa, resulting in ineffective treatments. When yin energy overtakes yang, the womb becomes cold due to this yin influence, leading to stagnant blood flow, which aligns with the concept that during cold weather, water freezes, hence the irregularities such as having a scanty flow after the period. Conversely, when yang energy overpowers yin, blood flows excessively and erratically; this occurs under hot conditions, where the menstrual flow is overly abundant, thus arriving before the expected time. It is essential to discern between yin and yang, harmonize blood and energy, preventing them from overpowering each other, ensuring a regular cycle. The recommended remedy is the Purple Quartz Pills.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>On the Expiry of the Heavenly Period</strong></p>
<p>When a woman&#39;s heavenly period has expired, her meridians are irregular; she may not menstruate for three or four months, or may have a monthly recurrence. If there is pain in the waist and abdomen, the Huangdi Neijing states that a woman&#39;s vitality decreases with age, and if her periods do not come on time, it indicates an excess of blood. It should not be stopped, but instead, the focus should be on regularity and alleviating waist pain, preferably using Danggui Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Enters the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>For women suffering from cold-induced fever, the treatment is no different from that for men. However, if heat enters the blood chamber, it is different; one should use Siwu Decoction to nourish the blood, supplemented with medications to induce sweating and relieve the condition. </p>
<p>For women with cold-induced fever, presenting with spontaneous sweating, headache, stiff neck and back, fever and chills, and a pulse that is floating and slow, it is feared that heat has entered the blood chamber; thus, Gui Zhi Decoction should be used with an increased amount of Shao Yao. </p>
<p>For women with cold-induced fever characterized by a floating and tight pulse, headache, body heat, chills without sweating, it is also feared that heat may have entered the blood chamber; therefore, Ma Huang Decoction should be administered, adding Sheng Di. </p>
<p>When a woman has cold-induced fever, with menstrual flow just beginning to cease, exhibiting chills and fever similar to malaria, and is speaking wildly as if seeing ghosts, Gan Jiang and Chai Hu Decoction is advised. </p>
<p>For young unmarried women experiencing cold-induced fever, with menstruation arriving and ceasing at the appropriate times, and clear-headed during the day but speaking nonsense at night as if seeing spiritual beings, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be combined with Sheng Di Decoction.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>When a woman suffers from cold damage with fever, her pulse is long and wiry, indicating the Yangming and Shaoyang stages. There will be alternating chills and fever, restlessness at night and peace during the day, as if seeing ghosts. If her menstrual flow is irregular, with heat entering the blood chamber but not resulting in fullness, she should be treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang plus Mu Dan Pi; if there is fullness, she should be treated with Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang.</p>
<p>In cases where a woman suffers from cold damage, experiences headache, and has a floating pulse, if the doctor prescribes purging, the evil qi will take advantage of the deficiency and penetrate inward. If the menstrual flow is obstructed, with hardness under the heart, dry mouth, and a dry tongue, along with alternating chills and fevers, and a pulse that is deep and rapid, she should be purged with Xiao Chai Hu Tang plus Mang Xiao and Da Huang Tang.</p>
<p>When a woman suffers from cold damage, experiencing exterior deficiency with spontaneous sweating, coolness of the body, stiff and tense limbs, and a deep and slow pulse, this is attributed to the Taiyang channel disease, rooted in the Shaoyin. If her menstrual flow is irregular, she should be treated with Gui Zhi Tang plus Fu Zi and Hong Hua Tang.</p>
<p>For a woman suffering from cold damage where the Taiyang channel is involved, if sweating relieves the exterior and the evil heat attacks internally, leading to heat entering the blood chamber, with excessive menstrual flow but no fullness, she should be treated with Gan Cao Shao Yao Tang.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>On Irregular Menstruation:</strong></p>
<p>If a woman&#39;s menstruation is irregular due to damage to the spleen and stomach, it should not be hastily interpreted as a case of menstrual cessation and blood stagnation. The use of drastic medicine to promote menstruation and break up blood clots should be avoided. In such cases, one must carefully assess the condition of the spleen and stomach. If the irregularity arises from diet and fatigue leading to damage to the spleen and stomach, characterized by poor appetite, bad food, diarrhea, and pain; or if it results from mistakenly taking purgative or depleting medications that affect the inner energy, leading to insufficient blood flow, then it is advisable to nourish the spleen and stomach. One can use bai zhu (Atractylodes) as the main ingredient, with fu ling (Poria), xiao yao (Peony), and assist with huang qi (Astragalus), gan cao (Licorice), chen pi ( dried tangerine peel), mai ya (Barley), chuan xiong (Szechuan Lovage), dang gui (Angelica), chai hu (Bupleurum), and other herbs. When the spleen is strong, it can generate blood and the menstruation will resume naturally. </p>
<p>In cases where food stagnation damages the spleen and stomach, one should also aim to resolve the stagnation and tonify the spleen. If there are no issues with the spleen and stomach but indeed blood clots are formed, only then should one consider promoting blood circulation and regulating menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When both the heart and spleen are in harmony, all the organs and tissues are nourished, and menstrual conditions are normal. However, if the heart and spleen are harmed, blood will not be nourished nor regulated, leading to menstrual irregularities. Thus, when regulating menstruation, the focus should be on harmonizing the heart and spleen, as previously discussed in &quot;Liang Fang&quot; under the section on irregular menstruation. Generally, methods to regulate menstruation include: if liver and spleen blood is dry, focus on Si Wu Decoction; if liver and spleen blood is weak, focus on Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; if there is liver qi stagnation with heat, focus on Gui Pi Decoction; and if there is liver anger and heat, focus on a modified Xiao Yao San. The causes of illness are varied and cannot be exhaustively listed; treatment should be adaptable to each individual case.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming - Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Irregularities</strong></p>
<p>Women are governed by blood; when the true essence descends, the Yin and Yang merge, the kidney energy is fully prosperous, and the blood circulates. This typically occurs once every three weeks, symbolizing the waxing and waning of the moon, thus referred to as menstruation. The flow of menstruation and postpartum recovery are similar; if there is residual blood remaining after the period, or if exposed to wind, cold, damp, heat, or harmful energies, or if internally injured by cold, or if emotional disturbances cause stagnation, it may result in phlegm or blood stasis. This condition is termed blood stagnation. </p>
<p>After menstruation, excessive exertion, too much intimacy, or ingestion of heated, dry foods can provoke fire, strengthen the harmful energies, and deplete essence and blood, leading to what is called blood depletion. The text &quot;Good Formulas&quot; states: if startled after menstruation, the blood and energy can become chaotic and might reverse; if it moves upwards, it may exit through the mouth and nose, and if it moves downwards, it can lead to water accumulation. Anger causes the energy and blood to rebel, resulting in severe pain in the waist, legs, heart, abdomen, back, flanks, hands, and feet. When menstruation occurs, symptoms arise; if overdue, they stop. Extreme anger damages the liver, resulting in dizziness, vomiting of blood, scrofula, blood wind, sores, and ulcers. Moreover, if menstrual blood leaks, it can create sores in the orifices, causing non-stop dripping; when damp heat combines, it may cause excessive menstruation; when blood stagnates internally, it leads to symptomatic masses. </p>
<p>All these varied symptoms stem from mere blood stagnation and depletion. However, blood stagnation can also have conditions of false heat, and blood depletion can likewise indicate false heat. Thus, severe cases can lead to amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). In terms of stagnation and depletion, mild cases will show menstrual irregularities, while solely considering deficiency and heat respectively.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>For blood stagnation and menstrual blockage that should be resolved, the causes are dietary heat and toxins, or excessive anger causing condensation of blood and phlegm. One must use substances like rhubarb and related herbs to promote transformation, allowing old blood to dissipate and new blood to be generated. If vigorous energy depletes the blood due to overwork and worry, it is better to nourish gently and harmoniously. If there is also phlegm, fire, or damp heat present, it is essential to clear and cool these conditions. Cinnamon is often used as an adjunct because it promotes blood circulation when there is heat, but one must not take harsh drugs that harm the Yin. Regarding the theory of depleting Qi while enhancing blood, although it is essential in gynecology, blood is paired with Qi. When Qi is hot, the blood is hot; when Qi is cold, the blood is cold; when Qi rises, it rises; when Qi descends, it descends; when Qi circulates, it circulates; when Qi stagnates, it stagnates. If there is accumulated fire energy in the blood, one may use Xiao Feng San or Qi regulating powder, supplemented with aromatics, areca nut, and bitter orange peel to open the stagnation and move the Qi.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>When the qi is disturbed, it must be regulated; when the qi is cold, it needs warmth; when the qi is weak, it should be replenished; this applies to both men and women. Indeed, when the yang is strong, the yin naturally grows; when the qi is depleted, the blood will also decrease. Can one solely exhaust their qi? Many scholars mistakenly follow Shuhe, who argues that strong blood leads to weak qi, not realizing that Shuhe discusses the liver and lung meridians, implying that the liver should be strong compared to the lungs; in truth, a balance of qi and blood is necessary for conception, hence the saying, &quot;the two organs must be harmonized.&quot; Yet women often face bias, and their aspirations remain unfulfilled. They frequently experience pent-up emotions and anger; thus, Xiangfu is considered a miraculous herb for women. The classics state: when pathogenic qi is excessive, there is fullness; when the right qi is lacking, there is emptiness. Must one not understand this? </p>
<p>During menstruation, if one experiences wind and cold entering the body, it can lead to stagnation and clotted blood; a slight warming medicinal soup is recommended. If menstruation is accompanied by a sudden onset of cold and heat, resulting in a blockage, whether it is cold or heat, it is all referred to as heat entering the blood chamber; one can use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Sheng Di Huang, or Huang Qin Shao Yao Tang with Sheng Di Huang.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>When one suffers from cold due to eating cold food or being exposed to dampness, leading to the stagnation of blood, one should use Wujisan with Mahuang, Mudanpi, and Honghua. If emotional stress causes Qi stagnation, use Fenxin Qiyin with Qianghuo, Banxia, Sangpi, Qingpi, and add Chuanxiong, Dangui, Xiangfu, Ezhul, and Yanhusuo. If there is heat present, add Huangqin or use a minor modulation formula with Xiangfu pill.</p>
<p>For cases of abundant Qi and blood, when the meridians are obstructed, or phlegm is present, one can use Dan Dahuang Gao. Alternatively, juice from Verbena can be boiled down to a pill or roasted until charred. Decoction of Honghua and Danggui can be taken. </p>
<p>For internal injuries from diet, overexertion, or weakness of the spleen and stomach, wherein one feels fatigue, has fever, abdominal pain, and reduced appetite without producing blood, one should take Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with Chuanxiong, Shengdihuang, and Tianhuafen. If there is abdominal rumbling and absence of menstruation, the issue is in the stomach, which is weak and cannot produce Qi and blood; in that case, one should use Houpo (five qian), boiled with water on an empty stomach, or just take a decoction of Cangzhu.</p>
<p>For diarrhea with reduced appetite, use Shengyang Yiqi Decoction. If there is no diarrhea and still reduced appetite, use Erchen Decoction with Baizhu, Huangqi, Tongbian, Zhi Xiangfu, Danggui, Shaoyao, Mudanpi, Maidong, Hawthorn, and Malt. For issues related to food stagnation, add Ezhul and Zhike.</p>
<p>If damp phlegm occupies the blood sea and causes menstrual obstruction, use Dantang Decoction with Chuanxiong and Huanglian. Do not consume Dihuang as it clogs the diaphragm; if used, ginger juice should be stir-fried. Indeed, the words of Danxi should not be taken lightly.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Heat in the stomach causes thirst, and those who eat well may gradually lose weight. When fluids are dried by heat, those who feel thirsty should clear the heat from the stomach. One can use a combination of Siwu Decoction and Tiaoge Chushi Decoction, called Yuzhu Powder; or alternatively, use the Liangge Powder, known as Sanhe Powder. For mild cases, a combination of Xiaochaihu Decoction and Siwu Decoction, removing ginseng and Banxia, and adding Tianhuafen is recommended. </p>
<p>Those with a thin physique, dry mouth, and a tendency to crave rich foods could have phlegm-fire due to stagnation. If there is a sensation of heat, one may use Xiaoyao Powder combined with Huangqin, without mint, or Siwu Decoction with Tao Ren and Honghua, or even add the nourishing Yangrong Pill.</p>
<p>Generally, the passage of water is blocked. Overweight individuals tend to have weak qi and damp phlegm, while thin individuals usually have a fear of blood and possess heat. </p>
<p>Young people may experience significant blood loss, or following drunkenness may engage in sexual relations, leading to depletion of qi and damage to the liver, especially if menstrual flow decreases. Treatment methods for these conditions can be found in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; specifically in the section on abdominal discussions.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Miscarriage and excessive childbirth harm the blood, or mistakenly taking medicines that induce sweating and purging may lead to diminished blood flow and lack of energy. In such cases, use the Shiquan Dabu decoction. </p>
<p>If menstruation becomes irregular, with diminishing blood flow leading to stagnation, this is referred to as &quot;blood desiccation.&quot; The root cause is insufficient emotional balance, which prevents the spleen from properly digesting food, causing a deficiency in lung nourishment and stagnant energy. Additionally, the kidneys&#39; water element becomes deficient, leading to further depletion of blood over time. Initially, symptoms may include intermittent dripping; if the spleen and stomach become significantly weakened, it may develop into diarrhea and bodily swelling. If left untreated, this can lead to serious conditions such as abdominal masses and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In summary, if menstruation is obstructed, without the presence of excessive heat, phlegm, or qi stagnation, the situation is generally similar. Adjust treatments according to the symptoms and harmonize diet to ensure the smooth flow of blood and energy. If there is significant stagnation, remedies such as Honghua Danggui powder, Ziqi powder, Tongjing pills, or Daojing pills may be used. For those with deficiencies, simply using Danggui powder to promote circulation is essential; afterward, it is necessary to nourish the blood and enhance yin to ensure fluid circulation. If one neglects to nourish qi and blood, relying solely on toxic medications for forceful treatment will certainly lead to death.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>To speak of the expected period, those whose nature is harmonious and whose blood is sufficient can conceive easily; a difference of one or two days is not harmful. In terms of color, the heart governs blood, and the yin follows the yang; thus, red is the correct color. Even if not exactly on time, those with the correct color can easily adjust. </p>
<p>If the period is delayed by three to five days, it indicates blood deficiency. In this case, take Si Wu Decoction with added ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and bulblet. For thin individuals with merely low blood, double the amount of angelica and rehmannia in the Si Wu Decoction, adding a small amount of peach kernel and safflower. For those who are overweight and have a lot of phlegm, add south star, fragrant atractylodes, talc, chuanxiong, angelica, and cyperus to Er Chen Decoction.</p>
<p>For those who have a slight color and harmony, use Si Wu Decoction. If there is dripping wanting to stop, with irritability and rapid pulse, use Si Wu Decoction without chuanxiong and rehmannia; replace with three times the amount of eupatorium leaf and a little licorice, and take Ten Flavor Cyperus Pill. If there is internal cold and blood stagnation, with little flow or a shortened period lasting five to six days or more, use Si Wu Decoction with peach kernel, safflower, peony root, and sunflower.</p>
<p>If the period comes several days early, it indicates heat in the blood. Use Si Wu Decoction with added qin and lian; overweight people should add phlegm remedies. If it comes ten or more days early, both blood and qi are heated; use Si Wu Decoction with added yellow qin, bupleurum, and cyperus; for overweight individuals, add Qinghai Cangsha Pill with yellow lian and white atractylodes.</p>
<p>If the flow is abundant or lasts several days, five or six days or more indicates internal heat dispersing the blood; use Si Wu Decoction with qin and atractylodes. If thin individuals have fire, take Guo Jing Pill. For those who are overweight and have phlegm, take Qinghai Cangsha Pill.</p>
<p>Periods may come early or late, in large or small amounts; there may be a month’s delay, or it may recur in a month. In such cases, take Dong Gui San, Adjusting Menstrual Powder, or Dan Dan Shen San.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>At times it flows, at times it stops, dripping continuously; pain arises in the abdomen, indicating that cold and heat evils are lodged in the body, causing pain due to stagnation of blood. If there are symptoms of intermittent diarrhea, healing occurs after excretion. If there is rebellious qi below the navel, attacking the chest and causing the urge to vomit, use Peach Kernel Powder; alternatively, take three qian of Danggui and three qian of Jangqi, formed into honey pills. For pain in the waist and abdomen, use Niu Xi Powder. If there is a change between movement and stillness, with heart pain, use Shixiao Powder. When the menstrual flow comes and stops appropriately, alternating between cold and heat, first take Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Di Huang, then harmonize with Si Wu Decoction. For frequent menstruation, increase the amount of Shao Yao in Si Wu Decoction and add Huang Qi. For continuous menstruation, add Di Yu, Ejiao, and Jing Jie to Si Wu Decoction. If hot, double the amount of Huang Qi or take Gu Jing Wan. </p>
<p>Purple discharge indicates wind, black indicates severe heat, pale white indicates deficiency, or it may be mixed with phlegm and stagnant water.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Like smoke and dust, like leaking water from a roof, like the color of bean juice, or mixed with yellow and muddy, this signifies damp phlegm. If it forms lumps or pieces and the color remains unchanged, it indicates qi stagnation, possibly due to wind-cold invasion. If the color changes to purple or black, this indicates heat in the blood. Generally, for purple, use Si Wu Tang with Fang Feng, Bai Shi, and Jing Jie; for black, Si Wu Tang with Qín, Lián, and Xiang Fu; for pale white, use Guo Qiong Gui Tang with Ren Shen, Qi, Bai Shao, and Xiang Fu; if there is phlegm, use Er Chen Tang with Qiong and Gui; if like smoke and dust, use Er Chen Tang with Qin Jiao, Fang Feng, and Cang Zhu; if like bean juice, use Si Wu Tang with Qín and Lián; if it forms lumps, use Si Wu Tang with Xiang Fu, Yan Hu Suo, Zhi Ke, and Chen Pi. Commonly used remedies include Hu Po Tiao Jing Wan, Bai Zi Fu Gui Wan, and Mo Fu Wan. The menstrual cycle should proceed normally; only then can one have offspring. If accompanied by tidal pain which intensifies with coughing blood, sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea with tidal sweat, then the blood will be further depleted.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>When there is effective vomiting, the energy rises; when there is diarrhea, the essence flows to the back; when there is pain, it is a sudden obstruction in the middle. Therefore, one must first eliminate the illness before nourishing the blood and regulating the menstrual cycle. Among the conditions of tidal fever and pain, these are particularly common among women. This is due to blood stasis accumulating in the bone marrow, which leads to bone steaming; blood stasis accumulating and stagnating in the middle, conflicting with the daily generation of new blood, results in pain; if the blood is insufficient to nourish the whole body, it causes steaming heat externally; if the blood is insufficient and enveloped by excessive fire, or combined with phlegm, qi, or food stagnation, as well as external cold pathogens, it results in pain. </p>
<p>Tidal fever can occur at times due to internal injuries or deficiency; if it occurs at all times, it is due to external influences or excess. For deficiency, one should use the Great Warming Decoction; for heat, use the Four Substance Decoction with additional Chai Hu and Qin Pi; for menstrual obstruction, use the Blood Nourishing Decoction; for bone steaming, the Great Hu Lian Pill or the Great Black Chicken Pill. For the five hearts tidal sensation, use the Four Substance Decoction with additional Huang Lian and Hu Huang Lian. If there is no sweating, use the Poria Heart Supplementing Decoction.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>For those with sweating, use Xiao Yao San. For pre-menstrual heat, where there is blood deficiency and stagnation, add Mu Dan Pi, Tao Ren, and Yan Hu Suo to Xiao Yao San. For post-menstrual heat, where there is blood deficiency and heat, remove Chai Hu from Xiao Yao San and add Di Gu Pi, Sheng Di, Tong Pian, and stir-fried Huang Qin; this prescription can be adjusted to be an effective remedy for reducing heat. </p>
<p>For coughing, add Sang Bai Pi, Bei Mu, Jie Geng, Zhi Mu, and Mai Men Dong. For coughing up blood, add Sheng Di, Shan Zhi, and Mu Dan Pi. For vomiting, add Chen Pi, Ban Xia, and Xuan Fu Hua. For noisy stomach sounds, add ginger, stir-fried Huang Lian, or the combined formulas of Qing Lian with Er Chen Tang. </p>
<p>For common tidal fever, take Shen Qi Wan or Da Zao Wan, or use the ingredients of Si Wu Tang combined with one tael each of Tong Pian and stir-fried Huang Qin, along with one pound of Si Zhi Xiang Fu, formed into honey pills. </p>
<p>If there is abdominal cramping before a menstrual period due to blood stagnation, use the ingredients of Si Wu Tang, four qian. Add one tael each of Yan Hu Suo, Ku Lian, Mu Xiang, and Bing Lang.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>For severe pain, use Wan Tong Wan. If there is pain when menstruation begins, it is due to qi stagnation; use Wu Yao Decoction. For qi stagnation and blood stasis, use Da Yan Hu Suo San, or the Four Substances Decoction with added peach kernel, safflower, curcuma, yan hu suo, cyperus, and wood fragrance; if there is fever, add Chai Hu and Qin Pi. If pain is intermittent before menstruation, it indicates blood excess; use the Four Substances Decoction with added yan hu suo, wood fragrance, coptis, and cyperus. For pain in the leg and abdomen, use Nei Bu Dang Gui Wan. If pain arises from the cold wind during menstruation, causing pain around the navel, it indicates cold qi invading the blood chamber; use Da Wen Jing Tang or Gui Zhi Tao Ren Tang. If pain occurs when menstruation is about to start, use the Four Substances Decoction with added chen pi, yan hu suo, peony root, and licorice. For pain after menstruation, it indicates blood deficiency; use Ba Wu Tang or Xiao Wu Ji Wan.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>For many years, suffering from cold blood has resulted in blockages at the womb exit, causing vomiting of saliva, pain in the navel and sides, and coldness penetrating to the waist and spine. Treatment includes wine-boiled Dang Gui pills and a warming meridian decoction. </p>
<p>For pain before and after menstruation, one can use a combination of Jiao Jia Di Huang pills, Zi Yin Bai Bu pills, and Qi Zhi Xiang Fu pills. </p>
<p>Menstrual blood is a remnant of the meridians; when the Chong and Ren meridians are harmonized, blood flows down as it should. Worries and thoughts weaken the heart blood, leading to fiery heat and the blood not returning to the liver, impairing its capacity for storage and circulation. If the mother fails to nourish the child, the spleen lacks refinement, leading to reduced appetite. With less food intake, the lung’s metal element fails to receive nourishment, cutting off the source of water and life, resulting in irregular menstrual flow. </p>
<p>Those treating should know that the heart governs qi and blood; when heart qi is stagnant, it is essential to regulate heart blood, allowing it to flow through the heart channels. The spleen and stomach regulate the circulation of qi and blood; overexertion and diet issues damage internal qi, leading to insufficient blood flow. If it flows intermittently, treatments like Ping Wei San or Si Jun Zi Tang should be applied to nourish the spleen and stomach, restoring the generation and movement of qi and blood. This is a thorough method, addressing both the symptoms and root causes effectively.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>On the Matters of Young Women</strong></p>
<p>When a girl reaches fourteen, her vitality is strong, and her menstruation begins. It is not until she nears twenty that she should be matched in marriage, indicating the difficulty in cultivating feminine energy. Some may indulge in excessive salty, acidic, fried, and hot foods, leading to stagnation of qi and blood. For this, one can use Honghua Danggui San, Zihua San, or Dan Dahuang Gao. If a girl remains unmarried past the proper age or desires a man before she is of age, this can hurt her heart&#39;s blood, causing heating of the spleen and drying of the lungs and kidneys, which can result in difficult-to-treat ailments. It is advisable to use Siwu Decoction with Huangqin and Chaihu, or Xiaoyao San with fried Shan Zhi, Qian, and Lian to nourish the blood, cool the blood, and lower fire. Alternatively, Shenshen Qi Wan can be supplemented with Ziqin and Honghua to nourish yin; Bazi Ren Wan is also effective. For those who become angry, the Sijizheng Wan with Huangqin and Shengdi is recommended. For those who have been startled, Baodai Wan can be used. If menstruation is completely obstructed, Wosong San is suitable.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p>
<h3>On the Affairs of Widows</h3>
<p>Widows suffer from many sorrows: some cannot forget their husbands, some are unable to support their households, and some long for their descendants to prosper. Their hearts are often aflame with worry, like rich food causing phlegm and fire. Symptoms include discomfort from wind and fatigue, alternating chills and heat, red face, and restless heart. Sometimes, they sweat abnormally with a tense pulse, indicating the need to suppress the liver&#39;s yin. Treatments include Chaihu Suppressing Liver Decoction, Yin Suppressing Rehmannia Pills, and Yao Ju Pills. For those who are impoverished and have a bland diet, use the four preparations of Xiangfu. If one suffers from confusion in their mind each morning, fears light, and dislikes hearing voices, and only feels better after noon; along with symptoms like dizziness, abdominal pain, and anxiety, especially when menstruation approaches, these are signs indicating an inability to fulfill one’s desires. They should focus on calming the spirit and nourishing the body, using Si Wu Decoction with Ren Shen, Fu Shen, Chen Pi, Chai Hu, Qiang Huo, Gan Cao, and Xiangfu.</p>
<h3>Parasitic Conditions and Menstrual Irregularities</h3>
<p>A woman experiencing menstrual obstruction and abdominal enlargement within a month may face complications such as pain, indicating a parasitic condition, treatable with Ying Sha Pills or Wan Ying Pills.</p>
<h3>Temperament and Menstrual Regularity</h3>
<p>Women of a harmonious temperament tend to have regular menstruation; those who are jealous may experience irregular cycles.</p>
<h3>Hidden and Obstructed Menstruation</h3>
<p>When a woman&#39;s monthly flow is absent, it is also referred to as hidden and obstructed menstruation.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>The Distinction of Male and Female in Vital Gate</strong></p>
<p>Men store essence through this, while women tether their wombs. Men&#39;s essence is primarily influenced by Qi, with the Kan water in action, hence the steam becomes essence and appears white; in the presence of fire, it may also appear red. Women, on the other hand, are primarily governed by blood, with the Li fire in action, hence their blood fills and manifests as menstruation, appearing red; if phlegm is present, menstruation may appear white.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction in Blood Chamber between Men and Women</strong></p>
<p>In men&#39;s blood chambers, there is no accumulation and thus no fullness; in women&#39;s blood chambers, there is accumulation that overflows as menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Method</strong></p>
<p>A floating pulse with a weak quality indicates fullness in the sides and leads to obstruction in menstruation. This refers to the liver pulse. Weakness in liver blood causes fullness in the sides, resulting in coagulated blood and obstructed menstruation. A floating, empty pulse harms essence and leads to amenorrhea. This refers to the kidney pulse. Seeing this pulse indicates loss of essence in men and menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea in women. </p>
<p>For menstrual disorders, the pulse is soft as usual. Although the pulse at the cun position is balanced, there is pain in the chi position. A deep, slow, and weak pulse indicates excess; a caution for many incoming issues. A slightly deficient pulse is unbeneficial; what harm is there in intervals between months? If the floating and sinking are equal and slightly late or weak, after three months, the Qi and blood are insufficient. After more than three months, amenorrhea becomes difficult to handle. If there are heart and spleen issues, the floating is absent at the cun position. If the heart is insufficient, the left cun feels firm and knotty. </p>
<p>In general, a woman&#39;s pulse is often more moist and weak than a man&#39;s. A pulse that feels normal, even if menstruation is earlier or later, whether it be more or less, or even absent for a month, does not constitute a menstruation disorder.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>The pulse at the inch is normal, while the pulse at the cubit is absent or weak; if it does appear, it is faint. This indicates accumulation and pain in the lower abdomen and digestive system, with an urgent sensation in the heart, and the menstrual flow is not smooth. If the pulse is deep and slow, it suggests deficiency below, leading to abundant menstruation. If it is slightly weak and does not lead to sweating, the menstrual cycle will definitely come after two months, commonly referred to as a missed period. When the three positions fluctuate and one remains still, the inch pulse is slightly slippery, indicating a weak stomach qi, the slippery nature shows insufficient fluids and blood. If the cubit pulse is slightly weak and slow, it suggests a lack of fluids; retreating reveals cold within the yin, indicating retention in the cycle. </p>
<p>If the menstruation occurs once every three months, it may become scanty and not flow later, particularly for those who have experienced miscarriage or multiple births, this is referred to as blood exhaustion. The classic texts state that diseases of the two yang affect the heart and spleen, causing obstruction in their pathways, thus a woman misses her period. This occurs due to insufficient heart energy, leading to a lack of spleen function in digestion, causing the lung metal to lose nourishment, which cannot produce the needed fluid for the limbs, resulting in daily depletion of blood. Initially presenting with a profuse and untimely discharge; if the spleen and stomach are significantly weakened, this can turn into diarrhea with body swelling. If neglected, it can lead to serious conditions like tumors and consumption. </p>
<p>The kidney pulse is deep and slight, indicating qi deficiency; in women, this leads to irregular menstruation and band-like sensations.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p>
<h3>Diagnosis and Inquiry of Menstrual Issues</h3>
<p>Menstrual issues may indicate either blood heat or blood deficiency; or during menstruation, there may be external factors that cause the symptoms to dissipate after the cycle ends. One should not use medication recklessly, as it may lead to complications with the blood sea. If menstruation is absent, it may be accompanied by symptoms such as tidal fever, coughing, diarrhea, blood loss, or white discharge. If one can eat properly, the blood can be regulated, and the symptoms will resolve on their own. However, gradual loss of appetite and weight can be concerning.</p>
<h3>Heat Entering the Blood Chamber Causes Chest Tightness</h3>
<p>Zhongjing&#39;s writings on cold damage do not distinguish between genders, but for women, blood plays a central role. The blood chamber refers to the Chong meridian and blood sea. If there is fever from cold damage coinciding with the menstrual cycle such that it is clear during the day but leads to confusion or delirium at night, this is termed &#39;internal heat due to blood stagnation.&#39; When menstruation ends, the heat subsides with the blood, and if untreated, it may heal on its own. However, if the heat diminishes and the body feels cool, yet there is a sensation of fullness in the chest like tightness, or if confusion continues, it indicates that pathogenic energy has settled in the chest and side. If palpation causes pain, this is also referred to as chest tightness due to blood stagnation, and remedies such as Hai Ge San or Gui Zhi Hong Hua Tang should be applied. </p>
<p>For women who suffer from cold damage with alternating chills and fever, and menstruation suddenly halts, this is termed &#39;heat entering the blood chamber,&#39; which leads to stagnation of blood. In such cases, Xiao Chai Hu Tang or Huang Long Tang with additions of Mu Dan Pi and Tao Ren may be effective. This condition is primarily seen in women, and inducing sweating or purging should be avoided. If there is excessive joy or delirium, and abdominal distention is noted, it is advisable to use blood-letting techniques; however, one should not be constrained by the notion that menstruation must occur. Both genders have a blood sea, and if men experience heat in the blood chamber, it may lead to reckless behavior resulting in blood loss and confusion—observations marked by symptoms typical of the Yangming syndrome. Men are often affected through the Yangming, while women are influenced by their menstrual cycle.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>On Moon Water</strong></p>
<p>Women are of the yin category, with blood as their primary substance. Their blood responds to the moon, reflecting its phases, and corresponds with tidal movements—both the moon&#39;s waxing and waning and the tides&#39; ebb and flow. The menstrual cycle occurs monthly, in harmony with the moon, hence it is called lunar trust, lunar water, and menstrual cycle. The term &quot;cycle&quot; signifies regularity and established patterns. The &quot;heavenly essence&quot; refers to the life-giving water of heaven. Some practitioners erroneously refer to this as &quot;red lead,&quot; which is a misnomer. </p>
<p>A woman’s menstrual cycle occurs monthly as per her natural condition. Variations may arise, with issues such as delayed or obstructed flow indicating illness. Moreover, there are changes in regularity that ancient texts did not address and that should not be overlooked. Some may experience menstrual flow accompanied by spotting or bleeding from the eyes, which is referred to as irregular flow. Others may have a cycle every three months or may never cycle while conceiving, classified as &quot;hidden menstruation.&quot; After conception, if a woman menstruates monthly and gives birth, this is termed a &quot;prosperous fetus,&quot; commonly referred to as a &quot;dirty fetus.&quot; If months pass with significant bleeding yet the fetus does not abort, it is considered a &quot;leaky fetus.&quot; Although these situations pertain to the abundance or deficiency of qi and blood, they still deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, her heavenly essence manifests, and at twenty-one, it ceases, which is typical. There are accounts of girls aged twelve or thirteen becoming pregnant, as recorded in &quot;Records of the Chusan Family,&quot; noting a girl from Jiangsu who conceived at twelve. There are also instances of women in their fifties or sixties giving birth, as mentioned in the &quot;History of Liao,&quot; where a woman over sixty bore two sons and a daughter, which is indeed an exceptional case.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>Physicians should pay attention to this matter. When women menstruate, the foul, unpleasant fluids are dangerous, thus the noble should avoid them for their impurity, as they can harm the Yang and cause illness. Those who prepare decoctions for medicinal purposes, those who practice inoculation, and those who cultivate sexual harmony, all should refrain from such practices for this reason. The &quot;Boweizhi&quot; states that the country of Funan has a strange technique that prevents blades from cutting; if the blade is coated with menstruation water, it will perish. This is the foul fluid that harms the spirit, hence all medicinal substances should avoid contact with it. This claim is well supported. Nowadays, there are charlatans and sorcerers luring the foolish with tricks, using laws to obtain young maidens upon their first menstruation, calling it &quot;primal red lead.&quot; They concoct names and recipes, linking it to the &quot;Golden Flowers&quot; of the &quot;Certificate of Mutual Assurance,&quot; and the primary scripture of the &quot;Wuzhen Pian,&quot; referring to the same thing. Foolish individuals believe them, consuming the foul residues thinking they possess secret formulas, often leading to the emergence of ailments, which is truly lamentable. Thus, Xiao Liao&#39;s poem on the true gold elixir states: &quot;Those of the lower path have a nature inclined to indulgence, forcefully seeking to gather the Yang from others&#39; Yin. Holding the heavenly essence in the mouth, it is called a remedy, yet it seems a futile effort.&quot; One can derive wisdom from this. </p>
<p>For women experiencing amenorrhea, there are signs of excess and deficiency. Excess indicates stagnant blood, while deficiency suggests liver injury. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: &quot;When young, if there has been significant blood loss, or if one drunkenly enters a room, the Qi is exhausted and the liver harmed, hence the monthly cycle diminishes and may cease. Treat it with four fish bones and one Zhi jiao herb.&quot; This pertains to the sickness of blood blockage due to deficiency.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 382: Women&#39;s Meridian Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>On Menstrual Irregularities and Identification of Stagnant Blood</strong></p>
<p>Zhongjing treats menstrual irregularities with abdominal fullness and pain. If the menstruation occurs again in a month, use the Earth Gourd Root Powder. This remedy is designed to break down stubborn blood stagnation, indicating that menstruation is delayed due to stagnant blood. This was not previously discussed. To identify stagnant blood, one must differentiate between fullness and pain in the lower abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Dongyuan and Jiegugu&#39;s Method for Treating Blood Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>Both Dongyuan and Jiegugu&#39;s methods for treating blood deficiency focus on nourishing the blood and clearing heat. To nourish blood, remedies like the Four Substance Decoction are used. For clearing heat, Dongyuan classifies the conditions into three regions: if heat is in the middle, it leads to good appetite with thirst; treatment involves regulating the stomach with substances like Chengqi. If heat is in the lower part, causing constipation, it is treated with substances like Yuzhu, which is equal parts of the Four Substances and Chengqi. If heat is in the upper area, resulting from overthinking, it is treated with herbs like Qín and Lián, along with Sanhe. Sanhe is a mixture of the Four Substances, Cool the Diaphragm, and Donggui. Jiegugu states that one should first take calming heart fire remedies, also including Qín, Lián, Sanhe, and Yuzhu; then, one should take five nourishing remedies for health, which also include energizing agents.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Purple and Black Flow</strong></p>
<p>When the external pathogen first affects, there must be pain. If there is no pain, over time it will accumulate and transform into heat. Moreover, cold leads to stagnation, thus resulting in a purple-black flow; it is not due to cold.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pain During Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Menstruation involves the movement of qi and blood, connecting yin and yang, and nourishing the body. When qi and blood are abundant and yin and yang are balanced, the body is unimpeded. However, if the protective qi is insufficient to nourish, and there is a lack of blood to irrigate internally, then when the qi and blood are insufficient, menstruation may come, leading to pain in the body first.</p>
<p><strong>3. Delay Beyond Period</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Chuan Bao,&quot; a man born in the year of the Tiger belongs to wood, with yin present in yang, hence he obtains the number eight. A woman born in the year of the Monkey belongs to metal, with yang present in yin, hence she obtains the number seven. Men are governed by qi; once the eight is complete, the number is exhausted, and this leads to weakness in yang essence. Women are governed by blood; once the seven is complete, the number is finished, leading to cessation of menstruation. When the Chong meridian is vacuous and weak, if the celestial and earthly pathways are unconnected, then there will be no offspring. Sometimes, excessive labor or mismanagement of emotions, during the time when the meridians become weak, can result in attacks by pathogenic qi, causing menstruation to not stop and leading to flooding.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Secret Medicine</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Wanquan</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Treatise</strong></p>
<p>Yin and Yang are fundamentally different; men and women are of different categories. There are specialized treatments for different ailments, aimed at alleviating deep-seated illnesses in women. Menstruation arrives like the tides at its due time; the blood flow is ever-present, resembling the continuous waves of a river. When deemed without illness, one may forgo medicine. Yet, if it comes early before its time, the qi may be excessive and the blood can easily diminish; if it comes late, the qi may be insufficient, and the blood weak from the beginning. If the floral essence is faint, it indicates a deficiency in the blood&#39;s water; if the peach waves are purple, it shows the fire scorching the womb. If menstruation hasn’t occurred and there’s abdominal pain, it suggests qi stagnation and blood clumping which can be adjusted; if menstruation has occurred and there’s abdominal pain, it necessitates harmony in qi and nurturing the blood without errors. </p>
<p>Menstruating twice in a month indicates an invasion of fiery pathogens prompting qi and blood not to hold; menstruating once in several months results from depletion of original qi, leading to insufficient transformation. These are all signs of true deficiency, where balance and treatment are of utmost importance. Fullness without discharge means amenorrhea, blood desiccation, or the presence of masses; discharge without fullness signifies menorrhagia, leukorrhea, or profuse flow. Those who are consistently full dread the fullness within; those who frequently discharge worry about the loss of qi. The pulse loves to feel empty and weak, while diagnosis should avoid the excessive and rapid. Those who endure pain silently exacerbate their ailments; foolish women hasten their demise. Prematurely attacking with tonics may worsen the conditions; incompetent physicians may inadvertently worsen the afflictions.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>According to the classics: when a girl reaches the age of fourteen, her menstruation begins, marking the onset of her reproductive capability. Hence, when the cycles are regular, it indicates good health, and one should not rashly use medicines to regulate the cycles. If menstruation occurs before or after the expected time, if it happens twice in ten months, if it appears only once over several months, if it ceases completely, if there is excessive bleeding, or if there are unusual discharges, all these conditions indicate a disruption of regular cycles and require adjustment.</p>
<p>Generally, the methods of treatment are as follows: if there is heat, clear it; if there is cold, warm it; if there is deficiency, tonify it; if there is stagnation, move it; if there is excess, solidify it; if there is descent, elevate it. Treatment should be administered based on the diagnosis, aiming for balance. For example, Qinghao, Lian, Zhi, and Bai are cooling herbs; ginger, cassia, Ding, and Fu are warming herbs; ginseng, Jizhu, Angelica, and Fu are tonifying herbs; Chuanxiong, Xiangfu, Qingpi, and Yanhusuo are herbs for moving stagnation; oyster, red stone fat, palm ash, and arborvitae leaves are for solidifying essence; and Shengma, Chaihu, Jingjie, and Baizhi are for elevating. When used according to the symptoms, effectiveness is rarely lacking.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>There are three reasons for irregular menstrual cycles in women:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spleen deficiency</li>
<li>Damage to the chong and ren vessels</li>
<li>Phlegm and fat accumulation</li>
</ol>
<p>In treating diseases, one must examine these conditions carefully. For those with weakened spleen and stomach: it is said that diseases of the two yang (the yangming and the stomach) manifest in the heart and spleen, leading to women not having their monthly cycles. The two yang refer to the yangming stomach, which is responsible for receiving and nourishing grains, fostering blood and qi, irrigating the organs, and facilitating circulation. It is the sea of food and the mother of blood and qi. However, worry and excessive thinking harm the heart. If the heart qi is damaged, the splenic qi cannot be nourished, leading to stagnation and blockage. Although the stomach can still receive food, it fails to perform its nourishing and irrigating functions, resulting in the loss of vital commands. Consequently, spleen and stomach deficiency leads to reduced appetite, gradual depletion of qi and blood, and conditions such as blood stagnation, pale complexion, delayed menstruation, and irregular cycles every few months. </p>
<p>As for damage to the chong and ren vessels: it is said that gathering and exhaling influences blood and its nourishment. Therefore, when qi flows, blood flows; when qi is stagnated, blood becomes stagnant as well.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>The nature of women is obstinate and impulsive, prone to anger and jealousy, which harms the liver qi. The liver is the sea of blood; when the channels are obstructed, blood and qi will run awry. Moreover, Zhu states: If a woman&#39;s blood has not yet flowed but is forced, it can lead to misnamed ailments later on. Thus, if a man forcibly associates with a woman before she reaches the age of fourteen or during her menstrual period, it can cause internal injury leading to unregulated blood flow, and if this happens for two cycles, it can result in a miscarriage or leakage. </p>
<p>As for phlegm and fat accumulation, a woman&#39;s body should have open internal pathways, with no obstructions, while externally, the menstrual channels should flow smoothly, allowing for timely blood and qi. However, those who are overweight and full of fat have their foundational doors blocked, and if phlegm obstructs, the tides of the blood sea do not flow. Therefore, one may have delayed menstruation, experience minimal flow for several months, or suffer from abnormal discharges, menstrual obstructions, or infertility.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Preliminary Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>If the person has a mild disposition and no other ailments, blame their abundant and heated blood. Use ingredients like Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, Red Peony, Fresh Rehmannia, Anemarrhena, Ophiopogon, Prepared Rehmannia, and Licorice. If the person is irritable, prone to anger and jealousy, blame the heat in both qi and blood, coupled with stagnation. Use Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, White Peony, Fresh Rehmannia, roasted Scutellaria, roasted Coptis, urine-preserved Cyperus, and similar ingredients. If the individual is thin and has no other diseases, blame their blood heat. Use Four Substances Decoction combined with roasted Scutellaria and Coptis, Red Peony, and Licorice, along with Sanbu Pills. If the individual is thin but has many diseases and heat, blame internal injuries in the Chong and Ren channels. Use Rehmannia, White Peony, Cooked Rehmannia, Ginseng, Anemarrhena, Ophiopogon, Chuanxiong, roasted Licorice, ginger, and jujube, and it is better to regularly take Rehmannia Pills. If they mistakenly took hot and spicy medications, blame the repressed fire in the Chong and Ren channels. Use Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, Red Peony, Fresh Rehmannia, Berberine, Anemarrhena, Akebia, and Licorice. If the person is overweight, has phlegm, and is prone to stagnation, blame their qi heat and blood deficiency. Use Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, ginger juice-preserved Fresh Rehmannia, half summer soaked in boiling water, White Poria, Licorice, roasted Scutellaria, urine-preserved Cyperus, roasted Coptis, and ginger.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Later Period Treatment Principles</strong></p>
<p>If one&#39;s virtues are gentle and there are no diseases, the issue is attributed to insufficient qi and blood; use the Four Herbs and Four Noble Herbs, along with ginger and jujube. If one is impatient, easily angered, and jealous, the issue stems from reversed qi and insufficient blood; employ the Four Herbs and Four Noble Herbs with added green skin and fragrant substances soaked in young boy&#39;s urine, and regularly take Cangsha pills to adjust. If one is thin and has no other ailments, it is due to both qi and blood being insufficient; thus, use the Ten Complete Nourishing formula, along with ginger and jujube. If one is thin and eats little, it suggests a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to weakened qi and little blood; use Yigong powder with Tanggui and Chuanxiong soup as the main treatment, and also take Dihuang pills. If one is overweight or consumes excessive food, the issue is due to damp phlegm stagnation and limbs feeling cold; use Liu Junzi with Guixiong soup as the main treatment, and also take Cangsha pills. If one typically has a lot of phlegm, the cause is a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to poor nourishment of qi and blood; use Shenxiong Dabu pills and Dihuang pills. If one is impatient and frequently angry, the liver is injured, affecting the Chong and Ren vessels; use the Four Herbs with Chaihu soup as the main treatment, and also take Biyin pills to exhaust the fire from Chong and Ren. If one has previously taken warming and spicy medicines, use the Four Herbs with Huangbai and Zhimu soup alongside Sanbu Jiu as the main treatment. If there has been previous damage to the Chong and Ren vessels, use the Four Herbs, ginseng, Zhimu, and Maidong soup with Dihuang pills as the main treatment.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods for Several Months</strong></p>
<p>For thin individuals, ascribe their condition to weak spleen and stomach, and deficiency of qi and blood; treat with Shiquan Dabu Decoction and Dihuang Pill. For overweight individuals, attribute their condition to phlegm accumulation and deficiency of qi and blood; treat with Liujunzi Decoction plus Cangsha and Phlegm-Expelling Pill.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods for Before or After</strong></p>
<p>For conditions occurring before or after, address them as deficiency; adjust the Bazhen Decoction for treatment, and it is advisable to regularly take Black Chicken Pill.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods for Excessive or Insufficient Conditions</strong><a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>When a thin person has scant menstrual flow, it is attributed to deficiency of blood. The treatment is to use a decoction of Four Substances with added ginseng. In the case of a fat person with scant menstrual flow, it is due to phlegm and congestion in the meridians; the remedy should be a decoction of Two Elected Herbs with added chuanxiong and angelica. If there is excessive menstrual flow regardless of body type, it indicates heat in the body; the treatment should be a decoction of Four Substances with added scutellaria and honeysuckle, along with the Three Replenishing Pills. If the menstrual blood is purple, it signifies heat, and one should use a decoction of Four Substances with added cyperus and scutellaria. If the menstrual blood is pale, it indicates deficiency, and the remedy should be the Eight Substances Decoction, along with the frequent use of Rehmannia Pills. All the above methods of regulating the menstrual cycle should be applied during the time of expected menstruation, taking them continuously for more than ten doses, and the next cycle will be unfaltering. If using pills, they should be taken for a prolonged period for effectiveness.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for amenorrhea in women:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When menstrual flow is absent due to damage to the spleen and stomach, leading to reduced appetite and depletion of qi and blood, the approach should be to nourish the spleen and stomach and replenish qi and blood, so that the qi can fill and promote the generation of blood, allowing menstruation to resume. One must not rashly use agents that promote menstruation, as this can further harm the central qi and dry up the yin blood, leading to diseases like tuberculosis that are beyond remedy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When menstrual flow does not occur due to emotional disturbances such as sadness, anxiety, anger, or resentment, which can cause qi stagnation and blood stasis, the treatment should focus on regulating stagnated qi and promoting the movement of blood, allowing menstruation to resume. Using tonics in this case would result in the qi being nourished but leading to further accumulation, and blood becoming more congealed, causing conditions like masses and abdominal distension.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When there is a physical block due to excessive body fat, leading to stagnation of phlegm and fluids which prevents menstruation, the treatment should aim to regulate qi and resolve phlegm, thus allowing the menstrual flow to occur. This is what is known as skilled practice.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Spleen and Stomach Damage</h3>
<p>For damage to the spleen and stomach, leading to insufficient blood flow, administer the modified Baizhong Yiqi Decoction. It is also advisable to take Shenzhushu Da Bu Wan and Wujirou Wan for relief according to the menstrual cycle.</p>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Qi Stagnation</h3>
<p>For stasis of qi leading to blood obstruction, the prescription is Kaibie Erchen Decoction. It is also advisable to take the Four-Ingredient Xiangfu Wan for relief according to the menstrual cycle.</p>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Phlegm Stagnation</h3>
<p>In cases of phlegm, use Cangsha Daotan Wan for treatment. It is also beneficial to take Kaibie Erchen Decoction with the removal of Atractylodes and adding Zhiqiao.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Loss of Husband</h3>
<p>For unmarried women who have missed their period, consorts who have lost favor, widows, or nuns in a convent, who wish to act but cannot, feeling anger without means to express it, and often suffering from amenorrhea; those who, out of shame, endure silently, which may lead to consumption and ultimately become irretrievable, should use the Four-Ingredient Xiangfu Wan and Shenzhushu Da Bu Wan. A combined approach of attacking and tonifying may provide hope for recovery. This transformation due to emotional imbalance is difficult to treat by standard methods.</p>
<h3>Treatment Method for Weak Pulse</h3>
<p>For amenorrhea, with symptoms of bone steaming and tidal heat along with a weak pulse, administer the modified Zengsuan Ba Wu Chaihu Decoction. If the heat is excessive and this does not improve conditions, add black dried ginger ash for effective results.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Excess Pulse</strong></p>
<p>For those experiencing amenorrhea with fever, dry throat, and dry lips, and an excess pulse, use the Four Substances Decoction and Cool the Diaphragm Powder as the main treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Regulating Menstruation with the Four Substances Decoction</strong></p>
<p>For women with irregular menstrual cycles, the Four Substances Decoction serves as the primary formula, which may be adapted accordingly. This is because the true essence of the boundless, the refined energies of the two-fives, harmonize beautifully. The male is formed through the dry (yang) path, while the female is formed through the moist (yin) path. Women, operating under the moist path, necessitate a focus on yin when treating them. When the cycles of twenty-seven days come around and the celestial essence arrives, and menstruation occurs at the right time, women receive the yin energy from the moist path; within yin, there must also be yang. Thus, the cycle of menstruation is marked by seven: one seven signals the change of teeth, and two sevens indicate the arrival of the celestial essence. </p>
<p>Humans receive the energies of heaven and earth to live, thus they can be affected by these forces. The moon represents the yin of heaven; it waxes and wanes, which is why the blood of women also follows a thirty-day cycle, hence the term &quot;monthly affair.&quot; The classic states that menstruation occurs on time, enabling conception. Therefore, for those with irregular cycles, this formula is appropriate as a base, allowing for adjustments based on cold, heat, deficiency, or excess. When the menstrual cycle is balanced, yin and yang harmonize, and all things flourish, leading to the ability to conceive. </p>
<p>The ingredients of this formula—Chuanxiong, Danggui, Shaoyao, and Dihuang—are all rich in essence. The richness corresponds to the deepest yin, thus they enhance blood. Analyzing further, Danggui is spicy and warm, invigorating the blood; Shaoyao is sour and cold, helping to astringe blood; while Shudihuang is sweet and moistening, capable of replenishing blood.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>It is also said: Angelica is related to the heart and spleen, peony to the liver, and cooked rehmannia to the kidneys. As for Chuanxiong, it circulates the energy within the blood both upward and downward. These four substances are essential medicines for women, and for regulating menstruation, they must be used as the main ingredients. A rapid pulse with purple-black blood indicates internal heat; in this case, add Huangqin and Huanglian. A slow pulse with blood stagnation indicates cold; here, add Guangui and Fuzi. For those who are overweight with phlegm, add Banxia, Chenpi, and Nansheng. For those who are thin with fire, add Shanzhi, Huangbo, and Zhimu. For those with depression, add Xiangfu, Cangzhu, Sharen, and Shenqu. For those with stagnation, add Taoren, Honghua, Yanhusuo, and Rougui. A late period indicates heat, while an early period indicates cold, depression, air, or phlegm. For those with qi deficiency, add Ren and Qiyi; for those with excess qi, add Zhi and Pu. Someone might ask if there are circumstances where the four substances are not suitable. I would say: Yes, there are. If the breath is weak, Chuanxiong should not be used, as its pungent aroma could further disperse the genuine qi. If there is diarrhea, Angelica should not be used, as it is moist and slippery and could increase the downward flow. If the pulse is slow with abdominal pain, Peony should not be used, as it is sour and cold and could increase internal cold. If there is chest constriction, cooked rehmannia should not be used, as it is thick and greasy and could increase dampness. Those who understand will resolve these issues, while those who are ignorant will make mistakes.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; by Zhang Jieben (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>The meridians are the essence of women.</p>
<p>The ancient Text on Natural Purity states: When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, the essence of her yin comes, the Ren meridian opens, and the Chong meridian is abundant, leading to the regular onset of menstruation, hence the ability to conceive. The essence of heaven refers to the postnatal yin energy; when the yin energy is sufficient and menstruation is regular, this is what is called the menstrual cycle. Because the female body is associated with yin, it responds to the moon, which waxes and wanes over three ten-day periods, while menstruation arrives regularly, hence it is referred to as the menstrual cycle or monthly trust. The term &quot;cycle&quot; means regularity; if there is any disruption, one loses their regular rhythm, leading to various ailments. Furthermore, since the cycle is fundamentally composed of yin blood, which is present in all organs, the blood from the organs converges in the Chong meridian, which is considered the reservoir of the blood of the five organs and six bowels. Therefore, the statement that when the Chong meridian is abundant, menstruation arrives on time shows that the Chong meridian is the essence of the menstrual cycle.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The transformation of blood and qi depends on food and hydration. When food and hydration are abundant, blood and qi are also abundant; when they diminish, blood and qi diminish as well. The sea of food and hydration is located in the Yangming region. According to the Treatise on Atrophy, Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, and it governs the nourishment of the connective tissues. The Chong vessel is the sea of the meridians, responsible for nourishing the streams and valleys, and it converges with Yangming at the connective tissues. The meeting of yin and yang at the connective tissues occurs at Qi Street, where Yangming dominates. Thus, both male essence and female blood descend from the front yin. It can be seen that the blood of the Chong vessel is entirely transformed from the food and hydration of Yangming, and the qi of the Yangming stomach is the foundation of the Chong vessel. Therefore, the essence of menstruation relies heavily on the Chong vessel, the stomach qi, and the heart and spleen; they are the source of generation and transformation. Other factors such as the seven emotions, six excesses, improper diet, and lifestyle discrepancies are nothing but thieves of heart, spleen, and stomach qi. One should discern what to pay attention to and what to eliminate, and learners should understand where to start from.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>Causes of Diseases in the Meridians and Organs</p>
<p>Women are primarily governed by blood; when blood is abundant, the meridians are regulated, and offspring can be produced. The prosperity or decline of the body begins from this point. Therefore, in treating women&#39;s diseases, one must prioritize menstrual blood. In ancient medical texts, it is stated that the heart governs blood, the liver stores blood, and the spleen regulates blood; thus, any injury to the heart, spleen, or liver can result in meridian disorders. Furthermore, it is said that the kidneys are the deepest aspect of yin, governing closure, while the liver represents the more outward aspect of yin, governing the dispersal. Both organs possess a mutual fire that is associated with the heart; thus, when heart fire is disturbed, this mutual fire reacts, often leading to erratic blood flow. This is one explanation. However, erratic flow can also arise from excessive fire. If the central qi is deficient or if the gateways are unstable, erratic flow can occur as well, resulting from the deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, which cannot solely be attributed to fire. Additionally, if the qi pathway is obstructed and fails to move, this is due to liver stagnation. If the essence and blood are depleted and unable to move, this results from the exhaustion of true yin, with numerous associated symptoms that should not be mistakenly attributed to stagnation. Thus, these conditions clearly pertain to diseases of the heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys, while the lung is often less discussed; yet, one must recognize that the movement or stagnation of blood is invariably related to qi.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>As the Classic Text states: When food enters the stomach, it nourishes and flows with qi, which is then transmitted to the spleen. The spleen&#39;s qi disperses the essence, which ascends to the lungs, connecting to the waterways and descending to the bladder. The essence of water is distributed throughout, and the five channels operate in harmony with the four seasons and the five elements, balancing yin and yang, establishing what is considered normal. This means that the process moves from the stomach to the spleen, then to the lungs, and subsequently spreads through the channels. Thus, if there is a departure of blood, one should replenish qi; if blood is stagnant, one should regulate qi. Qi is governed by the lungs, which is clear in its meaning. These matters reflect the necessary distinctions in the channels. However, if one examines the subtle intricacies, there are still further distinctions to be made. Generally, the onset of disease may stem from thoughts and worries, emotional stress, excessive labor, or the six evils linked to diet, often arising in the four organs of the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen; in severe cases, the four organs are affected, eventually implicating the spleen and kidneys. When yang is depleted, food intake decreases, leading to exhaustion of the spleen and stomach qi. When yin is depleted, essence and blood diminish daily, causing a decline in kidney qi. Therefore, I say: When yang pathogens invade, harm must return to yin; when the five organs are harmed, the consequence must reach the kidneys. This flow and source is inevitable, and is key to treatment. Consequently, when treating channel disorders, if the condition is not too severe, one should first resolve the underlying cause; if it has already become critical, one must consider the root and firmly secure it; to the point where both the spleen and kidneys are severely harmed, sources are depleting daily, leading to pallor and exhaustion, which could culminate in complete cessation. Those who mistakenly advocate simply breaking through stagnant blood will invite disaster swiftly. It is essential to avoid cold and cool medicines at any stage of channel activity, as well as in diet.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Menstrual irregularities</p>
<p>The menstrual blood is the essence of food and grains, harmonized and regulated in the five organs, dispersed and expressed in the six bowels, and can thus enter the meridians. Its source comes unceasingly, transformed by the spleen, governed by the heart, stored in the liver, disseminated by the lungs, and released by the kidneys, to nourish the entire body. In men, it transforms into sperm; in women, it manifests above as breast milk, and below it returns to the blood sea to form menstrual cycles. As long as the essence and blood are intact, emotions are balanced, diet is appropriate, the Yang generates, and Yin grows, then the meridians will be full, and what irregularities could there be? If one does not know moderation, the harm of the seven emotions is severe, followed by fatigue; perhaps also due to reckless desires, where strength and weakness conflict, leading to disharmony in the Chong and Ren meridians, these instances are not uncommon. Furthermore, external influences and internal injuries, or errors in medicine, may harm the nutritive energy, but there are always causes for such. People who are weak and often ill, unable to endure cold or heat, or wearied by labor, may often be those born with inherent frailties; however, if Qi and blood are properly nurtured but excessive indulgence leads to deterioration, or if the essence and blood are insufficiently full and are prematurely depleted, harming the source of transformation and growth, they will suffer lifelong consequences. This is the precursor to illness that should be thoroughly investigated and adjusted. If one wishes to regulate an existing condition, then the vital principles of deficiency and excess, Yin and Yang, are essential.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>Danxi said: Those who arrive early face a heat in the blood; those who arrive late face a deficiency in the blood. Wang Ziheng said: If Yang is excessive, it arrives early; if Yin is insufficient, it arrives late. Variations in quantity, interruptions, and continuous flow are all due to the fluctuations of Yin and Yang, a major consequence of imbalance. However, if it arrives early, although there may be heat, if it is deficient and accompanied by heat, the focus should be on nourishing the essence and calming the blood. Moreover, there can be cases of arriving early without heat, which may require either tonifying the middle Qi or strengthening the vital gate, but one should avoid excessive coldness. Those who arrive late primarily belong to blood deficiency. However, there are instances where heat causes dryness and stagnation, necessitating a clear supplementation; if the blood reverses and remains stagnant, one must promote its flow. In general, the method of regulating menstruation aims for harmony, primarily relying on detailed assessment of the pulse and symptoms. If both the form and the Qi are abundant, it is permissible to use clearing and promoting methods. However, the manifestations of deficiency are often prevalent, while those of excess are rare. Therefore, the key to regulating menstruation lies in nourishing the spleen and stomach to support the source of blood, and nurturing kidney Qi to stabilize the residence of blood; this dual approach is ideal. If the essence is fundamentally deficient and one is unaware of nurturing it, it will inevitably decline and exhaust; this cannot be overlooked.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Blood Colors</strong></p>
<p>In general, blood colors can be distinguished, and this naturally allows us to assess the presence or absence of conditions, and to identify cold and heat. If the blood is thick and abundant, this indicates robust blood; if the color is pale and scant, it signifies weak blood. This is a fundamental principle that is easy to understand. </p>
<p>Regarding the distinction between purple and black, the symptoms are as different as ice and charcoal, yet many people fail to comprehend this, leading to significant errors. Purple and black are closely related; nowadays, when people merely observe purple blood without distinguishing its true nature, they conclude it indicates severe internal heat. They fail to realize that bright red blood that is thick and forms patches or streaks is a sign of new blood in disorder, often resulting from internal heat. Conversely, blood that is purple and includes black, whether dispersed or thin, and that appears dark and stagnant, generally indicates a genuine depletion of vital energy and is likely associated with true cold. </p>
<p>If this condition worsens, it may resemble water leaking in a house or decaying old blood; these are all manifestations of purple-black changes. This reflects significant injury to the liver and spleen and a great decline of yang energy. In such cases, one should promptly use sweet warming remedies, such as Yin Jian, Li Zhong Tang, Gui Pi Tang, Si Wei Hui Yang Yin, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If one solely focuses on tonifying the spleen, the weakened will be lifted, the exhausted will be secured, and one’s original energy will gradually recover, leading to the resolution of illness. </p>
<p>If one exclusively attributes the purple color to a heat condition, death will undoubtedly follow with the use of medicine. This applies equally to cases of bloody stools and related issues. Scholars must pay particular attention to this.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br><strong>Blood Drought and Menstrual Closure</strong></p>
<p>Blood drought and blood blockage are fundamentally different. Blockage refers to an obstruction; drought refers to depletion. Obstruction occurs due to the stagnation of pathogenic qi, causing the blood to reverse. Depletion arises from the deficiency of the Chong and Ren channels, interrupting the flow of blood. Generally, when women suffer illness for a period of several months, they invariably experience menstrual closure. This is because the yin has become depleted, leading to blood drought, where there is simply no blood. </p>
<p>Thus, whether due to weakness, fatigue, coughing, blood heat, reduced appetite, loss of blood, or any conditions without swelling, pain, or obstruction, if menstruation does not arrive for a long time, it is undoubtedly a case of blood drought and closure. To prevent it from drying up, nourishing the nutrients is essential; to unblock it, supplementing is crucial. Just as when snow melts, spring water flows naturally; when blood is abundant, menstrual pathways reopen. </p>
<p>When the source is abundant, who can obstruct it? Yet, the present-day practitioners ignore whether there is stagnation or not, often resorting to dispelling remedies, and in severe cases, exclusively using substances like peach kernel and safflower to facilitate flow. Do they not realize that stagnant blood can be unblocked, but dried blood cannot be? If blood is already dried, trying to unblock it will only exacerbate the condition, akin to squeezing out the last drop from a dried fruit! This shows a lack of understanding of the meaning of &#39;drought.’ This can cause significant harm; one should not fall into this error. The treatment approach should be combined with the previous principles of blood deficiency and kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>The text describes the condition of a maiden whose menstrual flow has not occurred for a long time. Zhang suggests that for a maiden experiencing prolonged amenorrhea, one must avoid using cooling herbs like qinghao. Many practitioners incorrectly assume that the maiden&#39;s blood is heated, and therefore apply cooling remedies. However, it is not understood that when blood is heated, it flows, and when it is cold, it congeals. The book &quot;Essential Formulas for Health Preservation&quot; elaborates on this idea, which is quite reasonable and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>If the menstruation is slightly delayed and gradually stops, accompanied by pain in the limbs and weakness over time, along with a sensation of heat, and the pulse is weak and rapid, this indicates a deficiency of yin and weakness of blood, with excess yang prevailing. Insufficient fluid cannot diminish the rising fire, and the fire depletes the water, leading to the loss of bodily fluids. Treatment should focus on nourishing blood and yin, and one must be careful not to use toxic substances to force menstruation. It is advisable to use Baizi Ren Wan (a kind of herbal pill) and Ze Lan Decoction.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Blood Heat and Early Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Blood heat often arrives prematurely and must be assessed for its yin energy&#39;s strength or weakness. If the complexion is mostly red, or dark purple and thick, or there is excessive loss, the pulse will be rapid and smooth, with the internal organs desiring cold and fearing heat; all of these indicate types of fire.</p>
<p>To treat blood heat with fire, one should primarily use cooling and transformative herbs. If the fire is very strong, such as with herbs that withdraw heat, they may be used temporarily. However, one must not confuse false fire as true fire, or treat deficient fire as if it were excessive fire.</p>
<p>Generally, when heat is present, it tends to flow well, but if there&#39;s consistent early menstruation, herbs such as Xu Duan (Dipsacus), Di Yu (Sanguisorba), Dan Shen (Salvia), Qian Cao (Madder Root), or Zhi Zi (Gardenia) can all be employed. If there is a slight fire and yin deficiency leading to early menstruation, the treatment should nourish yin and clear fire, using decoctions like Bao Yin Jian.</p>
<p>Early menstruation should be considered approximately each month. Blood heat should be evaluated through the condition of the entire body’s organs. One should not hastily declare early menstruation due to imbalance when there is merely light bleeding. Neither should one classify it as heat solely based on the early arrival without evidence of fire in the pulse or symptoms.</p>
<p>If there is no fire in the pulse or symptoms, but early menstruation occurs, it indicates deficiency of heart and spleen qi, which cannot stabilize and retain the essence. In this case, one should use Da Ying Jian (Major Nutrient Decoction), Da Bu Yuan Jian (Major Original Nourishing Decoction), or a Five Blessings Decoction with additions like Du Zhong (Eucommia) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra) for treatment. These situations are quite common, and treating them as fire will certainly lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>If menstruation comes two to three times within a month, or arrives in as little as half a month or ten days, this indicates a chaotic state of blood and qi. Treatment should be adjusted based on the balance of cold and heat, and should not be treated merely as early menstruation.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>Blood Heat with Early Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Those with blood heat often experience an early onset of menstruation. This occurs when the nutritive blood flows smoothly and is not severely depleted. If there is an internal yin fire eroding the blood, it may also lead to a delayed period due to the deficiency of water and the dryness of blood. The treatment should involve clearing heat and nourishing yin, using formulas like modified Si Wu Decoction, modified Yi Yin Decoction, or Eight Flavors Pill to nourish yin.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Cold with Delayed Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Generally, those with blood cold will have their menstruation arrive later. What causes blood to be cold? It results from insufficient yang qi, leading to cold rising from within and causing a failure to regularize. This is what is often referred to as cold. When yin cold enters from the outside or internal cold injures, it could lead to blood reversal or pain; this is a different condition related to stagnation and should not be confused with blood cold causing delayed menstruation, which requires careful differentiation. </p>
<p>For those with insufficient yang qi and blood cold leading to delayed menstruation, the blood may appear dull, sometimes dark or stagnant and scarce. The pulse may be weak, thin, or deep, and the vital energy of the organs may manifest as aversion to cold and preference for warmth. These symptoms indicate a lack of fire in the body, and the treatment should involve warming and nourishing the blood qi, using formulas like Da Ying Decoction or Li Yin Decoction. Generally, since cold leads to stagnation, ingredients like ginger, cassia, Wu Zhu Yu, or Baijiu should be added, and in severe cases, Aconite should be included.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>Blood Deficiency and Menstrual Irregularities</strong></p>
<p>For women with blood deficiency, whether early or late, if the menstrual flow is irregular, one should examine the organ energies, discern yin and yang, carefully analyze the symptoms, pulse, and complexion, and prescribe accordingly to avoid mistakes. Generally, symptoms of blood deficiency may include a pale complexion, sparse flow, delayed menstruation, pain after menstruation where warmth and gentle pressure are preferred, fatigue following menstruation, weakness in the waist and knees, weak and thin pulses, reduced appetite, or a frail appearance. If there are menstrual irregularities accompanied by these deficiency signs, it is unwise to rashly apply depletive or cold treatments, as that may further damage the spleen and kidneys, worsening the situation. For cases of liver and spleen blood deficiency with mild stagnation and pain, the prescription of Si Wu Decoction is appropriate. One may also add cinnamon or scutellaria as needed based on hot or cold conditions, which is perfectly acceptable.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>When the three yin are deficient and there is neither heat nor cold affecting the internal organs, small nourishment decoction, five blessings drink, and six substances decoction should be used; these are the most suitable remedies for ordinary people. Alternatively, eight treasures soup and ten complete tonics can also be selectively used. </p>
<p>When the three yin are deficient and there is also yang deficiency, large nourishment decoction and regulation of nourishment decoction should be utilized. </p>
<p>In cases of excessive worry and thought that have harmed the heart and spleen, seven blessings drink and return the spleen decoction should be prescribed. </p>
<p>If the spleen is not strong, leading to a reduction in appetite, and warmth and dryness are needed, warming the stomach drink and regulation of the center soup should be given. </p>
<p>For a spleen that is deficient and unable to control the qi, leading to leakage and frequency, five blessings drink, return the spleen decoction, longevity spleen decoction, secret source decoction, or four gentlemen’s decoction with chuanxiong should be chosen. </p>
<p>If the liver is unable to store blood, resulting in frequent shocks or urgent pain in the lower abdomen, three yin decoction and liver tonifying powder should be used. </p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of yin blood, leading to water not restraining fire and excess evildoer fire, resulting in night sweats, restlessness, or thirst and phlegm, this is a gradual decline towards consumption. Prompt regulation is necessary, using one, two, three, four, or five yin decoctions as appropriate; otherwise, there is a risk of blood drying out.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br><strong>Kidney Deficiency and Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p>When women experience irregularities in their menstrual cycles due to desires in the bedroom, the underlying issue is often in the Kidney meridian. This condition is quite common and should be correctly diagnosed and treated. </p>
<p>If desires are unfulfilled, leading to prolonged thoughts and emotional distress, this may block the Heart and Spleen qi, causing depletion of the Kidney energy. This can either manifest early or late and may lead to gradual stagnation. In such cases, it is necessary to treat the Heart, Spleen, and Kidney, using remedies such as Xiaoyao decoction and Xiyuan soup.</p>
<p>If there is excessive fiery desire leading to the depletion of true Yin, it is advisable to use remedies like Baoyin decoction and the Eight Herbal Kidney Nourishing Pill.</p>
<p>If indulgence in the bedroom is reckless, it can certainly harm the movement of qi, leading to an inability of the Kidney energy to be sustained. Treatment should focus on strengthening the gateway of life, using remedies like Guyin decoction and Xiyuan soup.</p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of true Yin in the left Kidney and menstrual irregularities ensue, remedies such as Zuogui decoction, Zuogui pill, or Liuwei Dihuang pill should be employed.</p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of true Yin in the right Kidney and menstrual irregularities arise, one should use Yougui decoction, Yougui pill, or Bamei Dihuang pill.</p>
<p>If emotional distress causes illness, simply achieving emotional relief is crucial for efficacy. If the illness stems from indiscretion in intimate affairs, it is also difficult to rely solely on medicinal remedies without the willpower to exercise restraint.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>Menstrual Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>Menstrual abdominal pain has both excess and deficiency conditions. The excess may be due to cold stagnation, blood stagnation, qi stagnation, or heat stagnation; the deficiency may arise from blood deficiency or qi deficiency. Generally, pain from excess often occurs before menstruation and lessens during menstruation. In contrast, pain from deficiency typically arises after menstruation has started, with pain persisting or even worsening as the blood is expelled. One can usually determine between excess and deficiency by palpation; pain that can be pressed and massaged is often deficient, while pain that resists pressure is generally excessive. It is important to recognize stagnation or lack thereof in these cases. However, there can be hidden deficiency within excess and hidden excess within deficiency; thus, one must consider both the physiological constitution and energy balance. Careful observation is necessary, as words cannot encompass all nuances. </p>
<p>For women experiencing pain due to qi counterflow during their menstrual period, particularly in cases of complete stagnation rather than deficiency, it is essential to promote qi flow and use herbal formulas to regulate the menstrual cycle. In severe cases, formulas such as those for expelling gas may be appropriate. If both qi and blood are stagnant, one can apply the formulation called &quot;Lost Laughter Powder.&quot;<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>If there is cold stagnation during menstruation, it may be due to external cold disrupting the flow, or from habitual neglect of cold and chill, leading to a blockage and pain without deficiency. In this case, the cold must be expelled, and it is advisable to adjust the menstrual cycle with herbal drinks containing ginger, cinnamon, or dried immature citrus fruit, or to take a stomach-soothing formula cautiously. </p>
<p>If there is heat and dryness in the blood causing stagnation and pain, one should add ingredients to the Si Wu Decoction, or use a modified Baoyin Decoction with added or reduced herbs. </p>
<p>The above five symptoms should be examined for blockage without deficiency, as this is the true diagnosis. If there is a combination of deficiency, one must not forcefully intervene. </p>
<p>In general, women experiencing menstrual pain often have an element of deficiency; cases of pure excess are rare. One can distinguish between deficiency and excess by palpating before and after menstruation, which is a reliable method. However, some may have a fundamental deficiency in Qi and blood, resulting in poor blood flow.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>When there is a refusal to press, there is often evidence before the period, indicating a deficiency of qi and stagnation of blood, leading to a lack of circulation. However, by examining the physical signs and pulse, for those experiencing pain due to weakness and insufficient qi, one should specifically use the Jue Jin Decoction or Wu Wu Decoction with modifications; their effectiveness is remarkable. Alternatively, formulas like Si Shen San may also be used.</p>
<p>If the pain occurs after the period, it is often due to blood deficiency, and one should use either the Da Xiao Ying Decoction with appropriate modifications or formulas like Si Wu or Ba Zhen, as they are also effective. It is essential to observe the cold, heat, deficiency, and solidity to serve as supportive measures, ensuring no lack of effectiveness. If there is residual stagnation, the Jue Jin Decoction is excellent.</p>
<p>For women who experience pain during their menstrual period, often accompanied by vomiting when eating, fatigue in the limbs, or combined with cold and heat, this indicates a chronic deficiency of qi and blood. In such cases, one should only use formulas like Ba Zhen Tang or Da Ying Decoction. For those with pronounced cold and deficiency, it is advisable to use the Li Yin Decoction gradually to strengthen and nourish, which will ultimately lead to recovery over time. If pain arises from excessive discharge and deficiency, the use of Da Xiao Ying Decoction should be adapted according to the state of cold and heat.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br><strong>Heat Entering the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>When a woman suffers from typhoid fever or labor, or is affected by anger and heat, and then experiences her menstrual cycle, it can lead to heat entering the blood chamber. This may result in either unceasing bleeding or difficulty in blood circulation, causing her to be clear-headed and calm during the day, but to speak deliriously at night as if seeing ghosts. </p>
<p>If the heat comes from an external pathogen entering through the surface, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, or Three Chai Hu Decoction, or Four Chai Hu Decoction, or a well-known Huang Long Decoction adjusted with raw Rehmannia. </p>
<p>If the heat arises from internal factors such as anger or overexertion, and the person sweats a lot without exterior symptoms, it is better to use formulas like Bao Yin Decoction, Qing Hua Decoction, or Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction with adjustments. </p>
<p>If the condition is gradually improving but the vital energy is inherently weak and the heat has not yet subsided, and bleeding continues, one should consider using Bu Yin Yi Qi Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>If the spleen&#39;s energy is inherently weak, Gui Pi Decoction is advised; for those with both blood and energy deficiencies, Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction would be appropriate, so as not to make mistakes. </p>
<p>If there is much stagnant heat in the blood, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with additions of Dan Pi, Hong Hua, and Dang Gui.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>The discussion states: When Yangming syndrome presents with bloody stools and aberrant speech, this is due to heat entering the blood chamber, applicable to both men and women. It mentions that if a woman experiences a stroke and then, after seven or eight days, has a recurrence of cold and heat with intermittent symptoms, accompanied by a disruption in menstrual flow, this is heat entering the blood chamber, leading to blood stagnation, which can present like a febrile disease with recurrent symptoms. Minor Chaihu Decoction is indicated for this condition. </p>
<p>If a woman suffers from a stroke, with a slow pulse and cool body, showing symptoms of chest blockage, she should undergo puncturing at the Qimen point. If a woman with cold-induced illness has her menstrual flow arrive at the right time, feels clear during the day but exhibits aberrant speech in the evening, she must not disturb the stomach qi or the upper two jiaos, and she will surely recover on her own. </p>
<p>The blood chamber refers to the Chong and Ren vessels, and also pertains to the blood division. In general, ailments of the blood division involve blood stagnation resulting from heat causing retention, or heat entering the blood chamber leading to chaotic blood flow. Thus, if the blood is stagnant, its removal will lead to recovery; if the blood is chaotic, its regulation will provide peace. </p>
<p>The methods for regulation are such that overheating conditions should receive cooling treatment, sinking conditions should be raised, deficient conditions should be nourished, and stagnant conditions should be moved. If the pathogenic factor has not dispersed, it should be resolved. However, all these ailments reside in the lower jiao, hence it is said not to disturb the stomach qi or the upper two jiaos; only then will recovery be assured. This must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: If a woman experiences itching in the prohibited areas, abdominal heat and pain, issues with milk secretion, improper conditions in the vaginal area, coldness and pain in the lower abdomen, and menstrual cessation, the Central Extreme point governs these conditions. If a woman&#39;s blood is not flowing, the perineum point governs her situation. If menstrual flow is obstructed, leading to distension and pain in the waist and spine, the Qi point is responsible. If there is pain within the uterus and menstrual flow does not cease at the appropriate time, the Heavenly Pivot point governs this condition. If there is distension and fullness in the lower abdomen, with pain radiating inward, resulting in pain in the waist and spine during menstruation, and if there are masses in the uterus, along with cold sensations in the vaginal area causing patellar pain, the Water Path point is responsible. If a woman experiences poor menstrual flow or sudden obstruction, with symptoms of abdominal distension, heat in the body, and cramping pain in the abdomen, along with hernias and swelling in the genital region, the Qi is pushed upwards and needs to be released. If a woman has pain and hardness in the lower abdomen along with obstructed menstrual flow, the Belt Vessel governs this issue. If there is leakage below, and if menstrual blood does not flow properly, causing counteracting Qi and distension, the Sea of Blood point is responsible. If blood is obstructed, leading to infertility and lack of appetite, the Curved Spring point governs this condition.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>The monthly flow is unfavorable; if there is blood and a body present, it leads to failure and swelling of the breasts. This is governed by the &quot;Tears of the Luteal Phase.&quot; </p>
<p>For women who do not have their monthly flow, it is governed by the light of the sea. </p>
<p>When the monthly flow does not come and there is excessive closure, there will be pain in the chest and the eyes cannot see far. This is governed by the water sources. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: if the left hand has a pulse in the radial artery that is absent in the bladder channel, it indicates cold and inversely troublesome conditions; if a woman’s menstruation is irregular, during Wangyue (the lunar phase), the flow will be close. One should puncture the lesser yin channel at the ankle, exactly at the Tai Xi point.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot;: if a woman’s menstruation does not cease, moxibustion should be done above the white tissue of the ankle, following the year of growth. Another version states it is on the blue vein. </p>

<p>In the &quot;Records of the Historian,&quot; it is said in the biography of Cang Gong: The maid of King Jibei, Han Nü, suffered from pain in her waist and back, along with chills and fevers. All the doctors believed it to be due to chills and fevers. However, in my opinion, upon examining her pulse, I found internal coldness, and that her menstrual flow had not occurred. Thus, I treated her with medicine, and soon after, her condition improved. The root of her illness was her desire for a male offspring which she could not obtain. Therefore, I discerned the nature of Han Nü&#39;s ailment by examining her pulse and found it weak and unsteady at the kidney pulse. The weak and unsteady pulse indicates that it is difficult to establish a regular pattern, thus the menstrual flow has not come. The liver pulse was tense at the left side, indicating her desire for a son was unattainable. It is because men are primarily associated with essence, while women are primarily associated with blood. When a man&#39;s essence is abundant, he thinks of establishing a household; when a woman&#39;s blood is plentiful, she is capable of conceiving. The liver is responsible for regulating blood. The Jueyin pulse is tense at the wrist and extends to the thenar eminence, indicating that the yin blood is abundant.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>The &quot;Yuan History&quot; states: Pei Ze’s wife suffered from chills and fevers, her menstrual cycle was absent for several years, and she developed a cough. The doctors generally prescribed medicines containing gecko, cinnamon, and aconite. Li Gao disagreed, saying: It is a case where the yang attacks the yin, and excessive warming agents are ineffective and even harmful; using cold-blooded medicines will restore her menstrual flow. Eventually, this proved to be true.</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Door to Filial Piety&quot; mentions a woman whose menstruation was absent, experiencing alternating chills and fevers, dry mouth, red cheeks, a thirst for drink, and a cough once or twice during the day and night. All doctors diagnosed her as having stagnant menstrual blood and prescribed the likes of gall insects, leeches, lacquer, pounded stone, wild rue, and myrrh. Only Dai Ren disagreed, stating: Although ancient prescriptions include these remedies, patients who take them are bound to experience abdominal pain and loss of appetite. He then ordered to stop the medicines and gradually allowed food intake.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When both forms of yang disease affect the heart and spleen, if the heart is afflicted, the blood does not flow, hence the woman’s menstruation is absent. Once the heart accumulates heat, one should reduce fire and promote water to flow, moistening dryness and stimulating appetite, which will then cause the discharge of one or two liters of phlegm and several flows of water. Humidity will dissipate, allowing blood and qi to move freely, leading to the restoration of menstruation on schedule without being obstructed by dampness.</p>
<p>There is no need to use toxic substances like gall insects or leeches; if used, even if menstruation returns, small urination may be hindered, and other symptoms will arise. Whenever there is a deficiency of vital blood, it should be replenished through diet, and one must avoid toxic medicines that could lead to fatal consequences.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>A woman, thirty-four years old, had irregular menstruation, alternating cold and heat, a pale yellow complexion, with dry lips and a flushed face. She occasionally coughed a few times. The medications she had previously taken included Black God Powder, Black Gold Pill, Siwu Decoction, Liver Burn Powder, Turtle Shell Powder, Jianzhong Decoction, and Ningfei Powder, along with hundreds of acupuncture sessions, but her condition worsened. Her family, feeling weary, did not wish to seek further treatment. A compassionate individual intervened, first draining five or six liters of phlegm. By noon, the draining was complete, and in the afternoon she began to eat, with all other symptoms eliminated. Three days later, phlegm was lightly drained again, and one or two liters were removed, after which her appetite improved. In a few days, she was given a menstrual regulation powder, which resulted in the expulsion of one or two liters. In the following days, a significant amount of dead skin was shed, some pieces as small as bran flakes and others as large as reed membranes. Within a month, her menstruation resumed, and her spirit was greatly improved.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>A woman in her twenties suffered from amenorrhea, alternating chills and fever, and coughing with tidal fever. Mediocre doctors forbade her from eating anything, leaving her with nothing to consume. One day, as summer approached, she went out and unexpectedly saw a seller of cold jelly. She mixed it with ice water and consumed a large quantity, immediately feeling refreshed and invigorated. After several months, her menstruation resumed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A woman with prolonged malaria experienced little food and amenorrhea. Her pulse was weak, and every day she took over ten pills of Sanhua Shenyou pills, swallowing them with saliva. After a month, her appetite and pulse improved; after another half month, she fully recovered, and after one more month, her menstruation returned.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; mentions: A woman aged thirty always experienced a cold water shower after bathing. After a great shock, she suffered severe lower abdominal pain before her menstruation, followed by excessive salivation, and only then did her menstruation come. Afterward, she would vomit for two days, and the pain lasted until the seventh or sixth day when her menstruation ceased, and no medicines had any effect. I examined her pulse; it was slippery and large at the cun position but taut; the guan and chi positions were both taut, large, and rapid, with the chi smaller than the guan, and the guan smaller than the cun, which indicates the front is larger than the back. I then prescribed three liang of Xiangfu, two liang of Banxia, one and a half liang each of Fuling and Huangqin, one liang each of Zhishi, Yanhusuo, Danpi, Ren Shen, Dang Gui, Bai Zhu, and Tao Ren, seven qian of Huanglian, and half a liang each of Chuanlian, Yuan Zhi, and Gancao, with three qian of Guo and one and a half qian of Zhuyou. This was divided into fifteen doses, boiled in water, combined with two shreds of fresh ginger juice, and taken hot. Afterwards, she was to bathe with hot soup until slightly sweating, then stop.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>Avoid sitting or lying in the wind, having hands and feet exposed to water, and eating raw or cold foods. After applying thirty medicinal patches, a full recovery was achieved. Six months later, due to anxiety and worry, the previous illness relapsed, causing pain in the lower back and abdomen, painful urination, and a feeling of palpitations and anxiety. I believed the surface symptoms had resolved but the underlying issue remained. First, I applied moxibustion to the points Shaochong, Laogong, Kunlun, and Sanyinjiao to stop the palpitations and ease the pain. Next, I used Tao Ren (peach kernel) to induce a strong downward movement. After the treatment, I used three taels of Xiangfu, one and a half taels each of Poria and Angelica, and one tael each of Sanleng, Yanhusuo, Cinnamon, Rhubarb, and Qingpi, all prepared with vinegar. Additionally, one tael each of Qingmuxiang, Fennel, Talcum, and Mutong, along with one tael of Tao Ren, half a tael each of Wuyao, Ganjiang, Sand ginger, Betel nut, and Bitter neem, and two qian (drachms) each of Muxiang and Wuzhuyu were divided into twenty patches. I combined this with two qian of freshly collected Niu Xi (Achyranthes) and five slices of fresh ginger, decocting with lotus leaf tea for consumption. Gradually, the patient felt at ease after completing the treatment.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>The Chen woman, over twenty years old, was stout and felt bloated, her appetite poor. She would lie in bed until late morning, consuming a bowl of thin porridge daily, but afterwards would inevitably vomit up half a bowl and return to bed. Her bowels had not functioned for three months. Previously, there had been hidden connections, dark in nature. Upon pulse examination, her pulse at the hour of Chen was slippery and strong, while in the afternoon it was slippery but weak; when inquired, she explained it was due to an episode of anger leading her to overeat. Thus, I prescribed one and a half taels of Baizhu, one tael each of Houpo, Huanglian, and Zhi Shi, eight qian each of Banxia, Fuling, Chenpi, Hawthorn, Ren Shen, and Huashi, half a tael each of Sharen, Xiangfu, and Taoren, and two qian of Honghua, divided into ten doses, with each dose mixed with two drops of ginger juice; after three days, I administered Shenyou Wan and Shenmi Chenxiang Wan to gently purgative her. By the twelfth day, her vomiting ceased and her appetite gradually returned; after forty days, she returned to her usual state.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: A young woman experienced swelling below her ear, suffered from frequent heat and dry mouth, and had her menstrual flow come late and in small amounts. An elderly woman, thinking it was due to menstrual closure, used leeches to treat it, which led to her becoming weaker and eventually dying. The menstrual flow is governed by the hand Taiyang and hand Shaoyin meridians, which are interrelated; one governs milk and the other governs menstrual flow, as they are the residual energy of the meridians. If there is no invasion of the six excesses from the outside, and no injury from the seven emotions on the inside, and if the spleen and stomach&#39;s energy is strong, then the Chong and Ren vessels will be abundant, causing the menstrual flow to arrive at the proper time. However, with a pale yellow complexion, emaciated limbs, heat and dry mouth, and menstruation that is overdue and scant, there is a deficiency of yin and blood. This is not due to an excess of blood stasis but rather indicates the need for nourishing blood and energy. Gradually nurturing it will ensure the menstrual energy becomes robust and the flow arrives on time.</p>
<p>There was a woman whose menstrual cycle was overdue, and she experienced fever and fatigue. She used formulas such as Si Wu and Huang Lian, but after two months, the flow was still scant and clotty; moreover, using harsh drugs to expedite it caused her eyes to appear as if covered by silk. I diagnosed that the spleen is the chief of all yin, and the eyes are the root of the blood vessels. If the spleen is damaged, all the organs will lose their proper function and cannot return to the eyes. Thus, I used the formulas Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Ji Sheng Gui Pi, focusing on strengthening the spleen and stomach. After a year, she recovered.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>A woman had fever and dry mouth, with irregular menstruation and weak legs; after using a remedy to dispel wind and eliminate dampness, she experienced leg pain and fatigue, with swollen knees and obstruction of menstruation. I diagnosed her with deficiency in the blood of the three yin meridians and excessive heat, naming it &quot;Crane Knee Wind.&quot; After taking the Six-Flavor and Eight-Flavor pills for two months, her body gradually grew stronger, appetite increased, knee swelling decreased, and she was fully healed after half a year.</p>
<p>Another woman had her period arrive prematurely, experiencing fever and sweating. After using a remedy to clear heat and stop sweating, she suffered from thirst, dizziness, and numbness in her hands and body. I said: This is caused by blood deficiency in the liver meridian, leading to fiery movement; the excess of yang generates wind. I prescribed equal parts of Chai Hu, fried Huang Qin, Lian, Shan Zhi, Gui, Shao Yao, Sheng Di, and Dan Pi, along with Ren Shen, Qi, Ling, and Shu each at 1.5 qian, and 7 fen of Chuan Xiong, and 5 fen of Gan Cao. After two doses, the sweating stopped; I then used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, while menstruating and engaging in labor, suddenly fainted, her face reddened and she vomited phlegm. I determined that this was due to excessive loss of blood, leaving no source for yang. Quickly, I administered about a bowl of child&#39;s urine, and her mind gradually became clearer. I then prescribed 5 qian each of Ren Shen and Qi, 3 qian each of Xiong and Gui, and 1 qian each of Yuan Shen, Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and roasted Gan Cao in one dose. Additionally, I used Xiao Yao San with an extra two doses of Wu Wei and Mai Men Dong, and after a month, she gradually improved. However, she still felt fatigued and had a yellowish face, so I treated her with Shi Quan Da Bu Tang combined with Wu Wei and Mai Dong, and she recovered. If she had been treated with dispersing medicines, disaster would have ensued; caution is key!<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>A woman had long suffered from hardship. At the beginning of winter, she developed a cough and fever. After a long time, she coughed up blood and experienced night sweats. Her menstrual cycle was irregular, occurring every two or three months, accompanied by general body pain. She used phlegm-relieving and fire-subduing medicines, but her mouth was dry and her limbs were spasming. This indicated blood deficiency, and the medication was causing harm instead of benefit. I administered a modified version of the Bawei pill and tonic herbs to boost her energy, adding wheat sheath, five-flavor fruit, and yam to treat her condition. She recovered after a year.</p>
<p>Another woman had a melancholic disposition and worried excessively. Her menstruation was absent, her chest felt full, and her appetite was poor. She experienced bloating and sour regurgitation. I believed this to be due to deficiency and cold in the central qi, so I used the tonic to strengthen the center and approved the addition of cardamom, cyperus, and roasted ginger in two doses to soothe her chest and promote appetite. I further provided six gentlemen&#39;s decoction with added chuanxiong, angelica, fritillaria, platycodon, fresh ginger, and jujube in several doses to strengthen her spleen and stomach, and her menstruation eventually normalized.</p>
<p>A woman had long suffered from stomach heat and found relief with a胃清 powder but later, due to overexertion, experienced irritability, thirst, and internal heat, which led to weight loss and absent menstruation. I posited that this was due to stomach heat consuming the yin and blood. I prescribed Xiaoyao powder, adding peony and stir-fried gardenia to clear stomach heat, and used Eight Treasures Decoction with ingredients like poria and polygala to nourish spleen blood. Eventually, her menstruation resumed.</p>
<p>A woman had long suffered from malaria, feeling weak and experiencing afternoon fevers, spontaneous sweating, and night sweats. Her appetite was poor and her thoughts were troubled, causing her menstruation to stop. I believed that the deficiency led to the malaria, which in turn caused her amenorrhea. I prescribed the tonic to boost energy alongside the Liuwei Dihuang pill in over a hundred doses, and she recovered from malaria, subsequently regaining her menstrual cycle.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>A woman had seven pregnancies, her menstrual cycle was irregular, her legs were warm, and for over a year, she felt heat throughout her body, and her feet ached when fatigued. After another year, her lips swelled, cracked, and hurt; after another six months, her lips split and bled, her body became thin and fatigued, her appetite diminished, her menstrual flow ceased, and the area beneath her lips swelled like black dates, sometimes resulting in death from taking medicines like menstrual regulating pills.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Qian Sixi had no descendants after more than thirty years. His wife&#39;s menstrual flow was intermittent, and they had lived apart for several years. Qian Sixi wished to take a concubine to seek heirs. I believed this was due to anger and sorrow harming the liver and spleen, causing empty heat leading to blood not returning to the menstrual cycle, thus the liver could not store and the spleen could not hold. I decided to clear liver heat and tonify spleen qi, so I provided him with a modified Gui Pi and Xiao Yao formula in four doses, which I sent to his home, advising his mother-in-law that taking this would cure her condition and she could conceive without needing to marry another wife. Indeed, the ailment was resolved, and the following year, he had a child.</p>
<p>A woman was naturally impatient; whenever she was angry, her temples, throat, teeth, chest, and breasts would ache. This caused fullness in her chest, sour belching, and she would have little appetite and continuous menstrual flow. These were all signs of liver fire. When the liver was in disorder, external signs appeared; when the earth was overwhelmed, internal signs emerged. I first used Si Wu Decoction with Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Chai Hu, Stir-fried Zhi Zi, and Stir-fried Long Dan to clear the liver and nourish blood, then I applied Si Jun Zi Tang with Chai Hu, Shao Yao, Shen Qu, Wu Zhu Yu, and Stir-fried Huang Lian to strengthen the earth and control the liver, gradually improving her condition. However, the menstruation was still ongoing, indicating that the blood had heat and the spleen qi was still deficient, so I used Xiao Yao San with increased Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, and Chen Pi, and also incorporated Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with wine-fried Shao Yao for concurrent use to stabilize her condition.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>A woman experienced excessive anger, and her menstrual period lasted over ten days. After that, she had irregular bleeding without any end, felt weary and emaciated, had a dry mouth and internal heat, night sweats profuse as if washed, and very pronounced heat during the day. All these symptoms were due to depletion of liver and spleen, leading to an inability to generate original qi. The treatment included ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, poria, distant wisdom, jujube seeds, wheat husk, five-flavor fruit, moutan root, longan flesh, honey-fried licorice, bupleurum, and elevation of hemp, and she recovered. This condition initially arose from anger stirring the liver fire, causing the blood to run rampant. Later, it resulted in the spleen qi sinking, unable to contain blood and return it to its source, hence the use of the aforementioned medicines. If there is stasis due to heat in the stomach causing cessation of menstruation, one should clear the stomach. If there is excessive heart fire, one should clear the heart. If too many drying medicines have been taken, one should nourish the blood. If the illness has been long and qi and blood are deficient, one should tonify the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Another woman, feeling unsatisfied in her embrace, had abdominal distension with little sleep, a sparse diet, phlegm surging upwards, and frequent menstruation. I said, &quot;The spleen governs blood and controls phlegm. This depression harms the spleen, which cannot contain the blood and return it to its source.&quot; The treatment was to tonify qi and blood, and to use the formula to nourish the spleen, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old girl had a long-standing pox that would not heal, had not yet experienced menarche, was feverish and coughing, ate little, and wished to use a menstrual-regulating pill. I said, &quot;This is likely due to insufficient inherited qi, leading to a lack of yin blood. One should nourish qi and blood, and replenish fluids, allowing the menstruation to resume on its own.&quot; She was confused by the desire for quick effects and continued with her choice. I said, &quot;This is not the appropriate treatment.&quot; This is a vehement medicine that greatly boosts yang fire, leading to errant movement of yin blood; if the spleen and stomach get this, they become even more deficient. Eventually, she experienced erratic menstruation, ate even less, and consequently faced dire consequences.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>A woman with a pale or reddish face occasionally feels pain in her waist or below the navel, experiences fatigue in her limbs, and is restless with a sense of heat. Her menstruation, if it occurs, is preceded by chills and fever, with pain in her sides, and her bleeding is excessive. This is due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, with vital energy sinking, resulting from the combined effects of yin fire and damp heat. The remedy is to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Fang Feng, Shao Yao, and fried Huang Bai, while alternating with Gui Pi Decoction to regulate the source of transformation, allowing the blood to return to the channels.</p>
<p>A woman experiences abdominal pain during her menstruation, vomits when she eats, feels bodily fatigue, and has heat and thirst. This is a result of hereditary deficiency in qi and blood. After using Ba Zhen Decoction for more than twenty doses, she recovers. Two years after giving birth, her menstruation stops again, and previous symptoms recur. After taking Ba Zhen Decoction and Xiao Yao San for over a hundred doses, she recovers.</p>
<p>A woman aged fifty experiences internal heat, with evening fevers, and her menstruation occurs every two to three months. This is blood deficiency with heat, treated with Xiao Yao San and added Shan Zhu Yu, resulting in recovery. Later, she has phlegm-related thirst, irregular urination, or white discharge with a headache, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for stabilization.</p>
<p>A woman suffers from evening heat. She is thin and fatigued, has little appetite and no taste, and her menstruation is absent, along with episodes of nosebleeds and excessive menstrual bleeding for half a year. She tried remedies like Shun Qi Yin to clear heat and stop bleeding, but did not respond; instead, her chills and fever worsened, and she occasionally felt nausea. I believe it is due to anger damaging the spleen and stomach and false activity of deficient fire in the channels. So, I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction in the morning, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan in the evening for several doses, leading to recovery in half a year.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>A woman, inherently quiet in nature, experienced internal heat and irregular menstrual cycles. Every one or two months, she suffered bleeding from the gums, under the tongue, or in the throat for about a year. After taking cooling and blood-regulating medicines, she asked me for treatment. I diagnosed it as liver and spleen qi stagnation leading to upward-moving blood heat. I first prescribed a modified Gui Pi Decoction, followed by a modified Xiao Yao San, to restore the blood and regulate her menstruation, and her symptoms improved rapidly.</p>
<p>A young woman had been suffering from chills and fever with irregular menstruation for a long time. I first treated her with Xiao Chai Hu Tang plus Sheng Di, which led to slight improvement. Then, taking Sheng Di Huang Wan, she fully recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, due to anger, experienced chills, fever, headaches, and incoherent speech that worsened at night, followed by a sudden onset of menstruation. This was caused by liver fire due to anger. I treated her with a modified Xiao Yao San plus Sheng Di Huang, and her mind became clear. However, she still had a poor appetite and was fatigued, with menstruation ongoing, indicating the spleen&#39;s role in holding blood was weak. I administered Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and she recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A woman, small and thin, around twenty years old, had dark purple menstrual blood that was irregular, experiencing abdominal pain before and during menstruation, with a dislike for cold yet craving warmth. Sometimes she would have chills, and her abdomen would hurt again, with a pulse that was thin, moist, and slightly slippery, with a heavy yet slightly full feeling on the pulse. This indicated blood heat. When asked how this cold could signify heat, I explained that extreme heat can resemble cold. I then used four taels of Huang Lian cooked in wine, two taels of Xiang Fu and Gui Shen Wei each, and one tael of Wu Ling Zhi, ground into a powder and made into pills to be taken on an empty stomach, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>A woman, twenty-one years old, experienced abdominal pain like cutting during her menstruation in June, unbearable to the point of seeking death. Her pulse was fine and soft yet rapid, while the pulse at her wrist was weak and heavy, close to being rapid. Wang said: &quot;A fine and soft pulse indicates dampness; if rapid, it suggests heat. A heavy pulse at the wrist signifies obstruction.&quot; </p>
<p>He prescribed half a pound of yellow aconite boiled in wine, six ounces of fried fragrant attach, three ounces of half-fried and half-raw five-spirit resin, and two ounces of tailbone cordial, ground into powder to make pills. Take three to four qian with warm water on an empty stomach, to be taken five to six doses. After nine years, she had a son. </p>
<p>Four years later, her menstruation continued for two months without interruption, accompanied by slight abdominal pain, and she took the previous pills again to recover. Afterward, her menstruation lasted six to seven days, and once it stopped, she had a clear water discharge with mild abdominal pain, again cured by the previous pills. </p>
<p>Again, her menstruation lasted only seven to eight days. At times during her period, it might last five to six days, then it would intermittently return, either slightly red or light red. After her period, she often had a clear water discharge, with severe pain in the lower abdomen that gradually spread throughout her body. Her chest, back, lower back, and bones in her legs also hurt, and the pain lasted from the time of the rabbit (from noon to 1 PM) to the time of the rooster (from 5 PM to 7 PM). The pain caused a profuse sweating, which, when reduced, alleviated the pain, allowing her to eat and drink. The pain had persisted from the beginning until now for a total of fifteen years.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>Why does the previous medication work repeatedly but now show no effect? Wang re-examined the patient and found the pulse to be flood and slippery, yet thankfully the patient still had some spirit. Wang said, &quot;This is not like before; it was once stagnant heat, but now it is vacuous cold.&quot; Dongyuan stated, &quot;It began as heat within, and now has turned to cold within.&quot; This is indeed the case. The classic text states: &quot;When the pulse reaches but does not surge upon pressure, it indicates excess yin obstructing yang, and treatment should be cold.&quot; Moreover, the patient’s physique was previously small and now is robust. Medical texts say, &quot;Thin people have hot blood, while overweight individuals have deficient qi.” Can they be treated the same way? What we should be wary of is that large sweating can occur without the pulse weakening, and massive bleeding without the pulse diminishing. The pain is more intense during the day and less so at night, as if due to yang deficiency unable to support movement, thus causing stagnation and pain. Given the symptoms observed in the pulse, it is advisable to use methods to assist yang. If the pulse weakens and the pain lessens, it indicates a favorable sign. Subsequently, a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria was prescribed, akin to cinnamon and aconite added in a single dose. After a follow-up examination the next morning, the symptoms and pulse were somewhat stabilized. After taking two to thirty doses, between February and May, the illness began to heal. The illness has differences in the beginnings and endings of heat and cold, while the medications vary in their application and withdrawal; physical conditions of robustness, thinness, and youth also differ. How can one method be universally applied to treat them all?<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>Wu Jiaoshan treated a woman with excessive menstrual bleeding, feelings of heat in the five palms, and afternoon tidal fever. None of the medicines were effective, but after adding Hu Huanglian to the Four Substances decoction for three doses, she was cured.</p>
<p>Wang Shishan treated a woman whose menstrual cycle was marked by a requirement to have diarrhea for three days before the flow would begin. Upon examining her pulse, it was found to be weak and moist, indicating a deficiency of the spleen. The spleen relates to blood and dampness. When menstruation is about to occur, the blood from the spleen first flows into the blood sea before descending as menstrual flow. If the spleen’s blood is already deficient, it cannot manage the dampness, leading to this situation. He prescribed Shen Ling Bai Zhu powder, to be taken at two qian each time, and directed her to drink rice water two to three times a day. After a month, her menstruation did not cause diarrhea anymore.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>A woman over forty years old, tall and slender in appearance, has had irregular menstruation and health issues. Her right pulse is superficial, soft, and large, while her left pulse is weak, soft, and small, close to a racing pulse. She often experiences diarrhea before her menstrual period. In April of this year, she caught a cold and coughed, used soup for bathing, sweated a lot, and then had diarrhea for a month. In June, after another bathing, she suffered from intermittent fever six or seven times. Although the fever stopped, her spirit remained unsettled. By August, her menstrual flow was excessive, accompanied by a white discharge. She experienced diarrhea and then noticed pain in her right foot. She had previously strained her heel, and now the pain had extended to her hip, leg, waist, side, buttocks, neck, and the right side of her body, all causing sharp pain. Whenever she coughed, her lower back felt as if pierced. The pain was lighter during the day but heavier at night, leading her to cry out incessantly. Fortunately, the pain eased somewhat, and her appetite remained normal. </p>
<p>Now, with the excessive menstrual flow and white discharge, light during the day and heavy at night, and the constant diarrhea, it is evident that there is excessive loss of yin, indicating a condition of blood deficiency. A formula of four herbs to stop the pain is very beneficial. In September, Wang re-examined her and realized that her condition matched what Zhongjing described as the principle that when yang is strong, yin becomes long. The excessive menstrual flow, white discharge, and constant diarrhea are all due to yang deficiency leading to downward descent, termed yang collapse. </p>
<p>During the day, when yang is flourishing, it fulfills its role, thus preventing blood stagnation, making it feel lighter. At night, with yin flourishing, yang loses its function and fails to operate normally, causing blood to stagnate and feeling heavier. Therefore, a mixture of ginseng and atractylodes to support yang was prescribed, and after taking five to seven doses, the pain decreased. This represents a change in the illness, and the treatment method is distinct, hence it is recorded.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　女人以血为主，血旺则经调而子嗣，身体之盛衰，无不肇端于此。故治妇人之病，当以经血为先。而血之所主，在古方书皆言心主血，肝藏血，脾统血，故凡伤心伤脾伤肝者，均能为经脉之病。又曰：肾为阴中之阴，臂主闭藏，肝为阴中之阳，肝主疏泄，二脏俱有相火，其系上属于心，故心火一动，则相火翕然从之，多致血不静而妄行。此固一说，然相火动而妄行者有之，由火之盛也。若中气脱陷及门户不固而妄行者，亦有之，此由脾肾之虚，不得尽言为火也。再如气道逆而不行者有之，由肝之滞也。若精血败而不行者亦有之，此由真阴之枯竭，其证极多，不得误以为滞也。是固心脾肝肾四脏之病，而独于肺脏多不言及，不知血之行与不行，无不由气。<a id="orig-85p" href="#trans-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>如经脉别论曰：饮入于胃，游溢精气，上输于脾，脾气散精，上归于肺，通调水道，下输膀胱，水精四布，五经并行，合于四时五行阴阳揆度，以为常也。此言由胃达脾，由脾达肺，而后传布诸经。故血脱者当益气，血滞者当调气。气主于肺，其义可知。是皆诸经之当辨者如此。然其微甚本末，则犹有当辨者。盖其病之肇端，则或由思虑，或由郁怒，或以积劳，或以六淫饮食，多起于心肺肝脾四脏；及其甚也，则四脏相移，必归脾肾。盖阳分日亏，则饮食日减，而脾气胃气竭矣。阴分日亏，则精血日涸，而冲任肾气竭矣。故予曰：阳邪之至，害必归阴；五脏之伤，穷必及肾。此源流之必然，即治疗之要着。故凡治经脉之病，或其未甚则宜解，初病而先其所因；若其已剧，则必计所归而专固其本；甚至脾肾大伤，泉源日涸，由色淡而短少，由短少而断绝，此其枯竭已甚也。昧者犹云积血而通之破之，祸不旋踵矣。　　凡经行之际，大忌寒凉之药，饮食亦然。<a id="orig-86p" href="#trans-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>　　　　　经不调</p>

<p>Translation of &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Plain Conversations&quot;</p>
<p>Qibo said: At seven years old, a girl&#39;s kidney energy is abundant, her teeth grow in, and her hair becomes longer. [Note: A person&#39;s life begins with the kidneys. At seven, a girl&#39;s kidney energy is robust. The kidneys govern the bones, and teeth are the remnants of bones, hence they grow. Blood is the fluid of the kidneys, and hair is the residue of blood, thus it grows longer.] At fourteen, the heavenly water arrives, the Ren meridian opens, the Tai Chong meridian flourishes, and menstruation occurs regularly, leading to the potential for children. [Note: Heavenly water refers to the essence given by heaven. The Ren and Chong meridians both originate in the lower abdomen, flowing upward as the sea of menstrual blood, which governs a woman&#39;s ability to conceive. Menstrual cycles wax and wane, thus women also release blood monthly in accordance with the cycle, and when depleted, it replenishes. Therefore, at the time of birth, the mingling of male and female essences should ideally result in children, as being in a state of deficiency makes one more susceptible to conception.] At twenty-one, the kidney energy balances, and true teeth emerge and reach their full growth. [Note: Adequate kidney energy results in the growth of permanent teeth, known as true teeth.] At twenty-eight, tendons and bones become strong, hair grows to its fullest, and the body becomes robust.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the physiological changes and implications of women&#39;s health related to specific ages and their connection to the flow of blood and energy. </p>
<p>At ages four and seven, a woman&#39;s blood and energy peak, leading to strong bones and long hair. When blood and energy are abundant, the body appears strong and healthy.</p>
<p>At ages five and seven, the Yangming meridian weakens, causing the face to begin to wither and hair to start to fall out. The Yangming meridian nourishes the face and follows the hairline, so it weakens, leading to facial and hair deterioration.</p>
<p>At ages six and seven, the three Yang meridians weaken at the top of the body, causing the entire face to wither and hair to begin to turn white. These meridians reach up to the head; thus, their decline results in facial withering, and the decline of blood circulation leads to graying hair.</p>
<p>At ages seven and seven, the Ren meridian becomes weak, and the Taichong meridian weakens significantly. The essence of life (Tian Gui) diminishes, leading to physical deterioration and infertility. The essence is stored in the kidneys, and when the Tian Gui diminishes, it suggests blockages in the lower pathways. The weakness of the Ren and Chong meridians contributes to physical decline and infertility.</p>
<p>The kidneys are responsible for water and store the essence of the five organs and six bowels, which is necessary for vitality. When all five organs decline, the muscles and bones weaken, and when the Tian Gui is depleted, it results in graying hair, heaviness of the body, unsteady walking, and infertility.</p>
<p>This explanation highlights the connection between the primordial essence of water and the acquired fluids that nourish the body.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The illness of the two Yangs affects the heart and spleen, leading to an inability to conceal the curving flow. When women do not have their monthly cycle, it transmits as wind and dissipates, or it manifests as breathlessness; those who suffer from this are incurable. </p>
<p>(Note: The two Yangs refer to the foot Yangming stomach channel. The essence and blood of a woman are sustained by the stomach&#39;s processing of food and water, while the spleen governs the movement of this essence. When the two Yangs are ill, the fluids in the middle jiao are depleted, leaving no nourishment for the heart spirit, leading to a deficiency of blood. If the essence from the water and grains does not circulate to the five organs due to spleen dysfunction, the kidneys lack storage and the essence becomes deficient. For men, a lack of essence causes issues with concealment; for women, a lack of blood results in their monthly cycle not occurring on time. This ailment originates from the two Yangs and manifests in the heart and spleen. When both essence and blood are deficient, heat manifests and leads to the generation of wind; the combination of wind and heat fiercely depletes fluids. Excessive heat can induce coughing and breathlessness, leading to death if not treated, for the stomach is the origin of the fluids and the lungs are the source of their transformation.)</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of heat illness:</p>
<p>When the monthly cycle does not arrive, it indicates a closure of the bao mai (uterine vessel). The bao mai is associated with the heart and connects within the uterus. Currently, when qi rises and presses against the lungs, the heart qi cannot descend, thus the monthly cycle does not come. </p>
<p>(Note: The bao mai is associated with the heart; when it receives heart qi, blood is formed. The chong mai and ren mai both emerge from within the uterus and ascend along the back, being the sea of channels. For women, it flows down from the chest to become the monthly cycle. When qi rises and presses on the lungs, true qi is inverted upwards, leading to symptoms such as bitter mouth and dry tongue; if startled, severe coughing occurs, indicating that heart qi is inflamed and not descending, which is why the monthly cycle does not come.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion of the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: If someone suffers from a condition of fullness in the chest and flanks that hinders eating, when the illness worsens, they will first notice a foul smell, produce clear fluids, spit out blood, have cold limbs, experience dizziness, and occasionally see blood before and after. What is the name of this illness? How does one acquire it? Qi Bo said: This illness is named &quot;Blood Deficiency.&quot; It arises from significant blood loss during youth, such as from excessive drinking in a room, leading to depleted energy and liver damage, which is why menstrual flow becomes sparse or ceases. The Emperor asked: How can this be treated? What method should be used? Qi Bo replied: Use four fish bones of the Tilapia, add one reed, combine both ingredients and form pills the size of small beans. Take five pills with a meal, washed down with abalone juice, to benefit the intestines and aid liver recovery. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Significant blood loss damages the liver; if the liver is harmed in women, their menstrual flow will diminish or stop. Energy is derived from essence and blood; when blood is lost, energy is depleted. The four fish bones serve to scatter energy throughout the limbs. Blood is produced in the middle burner. The single reed is meant to help gather and consolidate in the middle burner. Egg whites nourish energy, while egg yolks nourish blood. The pills made with quail eggs serve to replenish both energy and blood. </p>

<p><strong>Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p>If a woman experiences vomiting and her stomach reacts, as if she often has shortness of breath (or excessive salivation), her menstrual flow will also be interrupted and if it returns, it will likely be scant. </p>
<p>A question arises: a woman comes for examination, stating that her menstrual flow is less than before; what is the reason? The teacher answers: she has previously suffered from diarrhea; if sweating occurs with less frequent urination, this is acceptable. Why? The teacher explains: the loss of bodily fluids causes the menstrual flow to decrease. If her menstrual flow is more abundant than before, then she is likely suffering. One would express concern about the difficulty of defecation, and she would also no longer be sweating.</p>
<p>Another question: if a woman has three ailments before menstruation begins, what are they? The teacher replies: The first ailment is that when her menstrual flow initially starts, there is heat in the lower regions, which can be exacerbated by wind or fan exposure. The second ailment arises from washing with cold water. The third ailment occurs if she sees red discharge, which can cause fright and lead to illness. This is related to vaginal discharge.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The master said: A woman brought a fifteen-year-old girl for diagnosis, saying that the girl started menstruating at fourteen, but her menstruation has now stopped, and her mother fears it is due to a blockage. The master asked, &quot;Is this girl not the biological daughter of the lady?&quot; If she were a biological child, they should be able to speak about it. The woman responded that she is indeed her daughter. The master said, &quot;The reason I inquire is that when the lady was fourteen, she also began menstruating, which then stopped. This is simply a matter of age; do not be alarmed. It will return in due time.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked about a woman who suffers from diarrhea and has a disrupted menstruation, the master replied, &quot;One should only treat the diarrhea, and menstruation will naturally resume. Do not worry! The reason for the interruption of menstruation while diarrhea persists is that the diarrhea has depleted bodily fluids, causing menstruation to stop. Once the diarrhea ceases, the body will restore its fluids, and menstruation should naturally resume.&quot;</p>
<p>If a woman experiences blood loss and has a dry throat without thirst, her menstruation is likely to be disrupted. This indicates a deficiency in vitality. There is a natural slight cold, thus leading to a lack of thirst. If she feels thirsty and drinks, the fluids can circulate, harmonizing the protective and nutritive aspects, and her menstruation is likely to return.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Regular Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The master said: In the inch pulse, if it is faint and weak, the defensive qi is insufficient; if weak, the blood qi is lacking. When the defensive qi is insufficient, breathing is short and the body is dry; when blood is insufficient, the body experiences counterflow. When both the nourishing and defensive qi are deficient, speech becomes erroneous. </p>
<p>The foot yang pulse is floating and weak; if weak, the stomach qi is deficient. When deficient, there is shortness of breath, a dry throat, and a bitter mouth; when stomach qi is weak, it loses fluids. The lesser yin pulse is faint and receding; if faint, there is no essence; if slow, there is cold within the yin; if weak, blood does not arrive. This is known as the regular pulse, which appears once every three months.</p>
<p>Someone asked: A woman who is three months pregnant, when the master checks her pulse, says she does not menstruate; now, if menstruation is about to occur, what type of pulse is it? How can it be distinguished? The master replied: The inch pulse is floating and large; the nourishing qi is reversed and weak. A floating and large pulse indicates strong qi, while a reversed and weak pulse indicates less blood. The solitary yang is calling out alone, unable to draw in the yin; the two energies are unceasing, leading to a decline in the protective and nourishing energies.</p>
<p>The yin is accumulated cold, while the yang is gathered heat; when yang is vigorous, it does not nourish. The meridians being insufficient and the yin being empty causes the yang to emerge, resulting in reduced blood. At this time, there may be light sweating, a dry throat, frequent and concentrated urination, and excessive salivation. This indicates significant deficiency and fluid leakage, hence it is known that she is not menstruating.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the blood is full and flowing, when the month reaches a certain point in March, the yin is strong and thus flows out, termed as &quot;residing in the cycle.&quot; This refers to the right pulse being strong while the left is weak. </p>
<p>A question is asked: A woman of fifty experiences clear blood for two to three days; how should she be treated? The master responds: This woman previously had no menstrual flow; now, with the return of clear blood, this indicates residing in the cycle. No treatment is needed; it will cease on its own. Menstrual flow typically lasts five days; if it lasts five days, she will recover.</p>
<p>For women whose menstruation occurs twice a month, when the menstrual flow comes, the pulse may seem normal yet is slightly weak. If there is no discomfort or sweating, the menstruation must return in two months.</p>
<p>A question arises: If a woman has menstruation and then breaks out in a sweat, leading to confusion and disorientation, what is the cause? The master explains: The menstrual flow has come down. Thus, the interior is vacuous, resulting in sweating causing the exterior to also become vacant. This is a case of both interior and exterior being vacuous, thus resulting in confusion.</p>
<p>The master states: If the pulse is weak, both blood and qi are deficient; in the young, this is a loss of blood. If there are no other symptoms, this indicates residing in the cycle, skipping three months.</p>
<p>Another question: If a woman experiences a stoppage of menstrual flow for one to two months and then menstruates again, yet the pulse remains weak and thin, what could be the reason? The master replies: In previous months, if a downward flow was expected, it could hinder the menstruation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Women&#39;s Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Chen Ziming)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: At seven years old, a girl’s kidney energy is strong, her teeth change and her hair grows; at fourteen, she experiences her first menstruation, with the Ren meridian flowing and the Tai Chong meridian flourishing, and her monthly cycle descends on schedule. &quot;Heaven&quot; refers to the True Qi of heaven, while &quot;Gui&quot; denotes the water of Ren and Gui, hence it is called Tian Gui. The Chong meridian serves as the sea of blood, while the Ren meridian governs the womb. When these two meridians are flowing, the menstrual blood gradually accumulates and descends at the right time, typically seen every three weeks, resembling the waxing and waning of the moon. During menstruation, caution is essential; otherwise, it may resemble symptoms after childbirth. If affected by shock, anger, or strenuous labor, the blood and Qi may become chaotic, leading to various ailments. If there is disturbance in the head, face, or limbs, it results in severe, unrelenting pain. If anger injures the liver, there may be headaches, rib pain, vomiting of blood, and abscesses. If menstrual blood seeps internally, there will be persistent dripping from the orifices. All these six external evils can cause diverse symptoms; if they disturb one slightly, they can develop into serious issues as heavy as mountains. Should we not take heed? </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Blood is the refined essence of food and water, harmonizing the five organs and spreading throughout the six bowels.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, although the heart governs blood and the liver stores blood, all are ultimately regulated by the spleen. When the spleen is nourished and the stomach is harmonized, blood will naturally generate. During menstrual periods, it is advised to avoid bitter, cold, and pungent dispersing medicines, as well as restrictive food. As the verse states: &quot;A woman in harmony delights in having children; in harmony, yin and yang are not at odds; in peace, qi and blood do not clash.&quot; Hence, the text states: &quot;The harmonious qi should appear once every three cycles.&quot; Should one not take caution?</p>
<p>For women, when the heavenly essence arrives, if over ten years pass without a proper union with a man, it results in disharmony. Even if less than ten years pass while yearning for such a union, disharmony still occurs. If there is disharmony, old blood does not flow out, new blood goes astray, and it may penetrate into the bones or transform into tumors. Thus, even when union occurs later, it is difficult to conceive. If there are many unions, the essence may become depleted, leading to disharmony; excessive childbirth depletes blood, risking maternal life. Observing one&#39;s essence and blood indicates that half the problem is already recognized.</p>
<p>The menstrual cycle is a constant marker, indicating the stability of one&#39;s yin and yang and one’s well-being; therefore, each month it should arrive, neither too early nor too late. Any irregularities in timing, such as being too early or too late, as well as fluctuations in quantity, cessation of flow, or continuous bleeding known as &quot;beng lou,&quot; all stem from the dynamics of yin and yang imbalances. </p>
<p>(Note: According to the text, the spleen regulates blood and the liver stores blood. Such conditions often arise from emotional distress affecting the liver and obstructing the spleen, and treatment should focus primarily on these two organs while considering previous discussion.)<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a woman experiences an interruption of menstruation, it may be due to excessive consumption of food and drink while being intimate, overexertion, loss of blood from vomiting, or damage to the liver and spleen. If one nourishes the source of transformation, menstruation will resume. If there is difficulty in urination, bitter headaches, lumbar pain, and pain in the feet especially when cold, prolonged stagnation of blood in the body can lead to conditions such as masses. If blood and water are mixed, weakness of the spleen and stomach may cause obstruction, leading to edema. If the spleen&#39;s energy is weakened and cannot control fluids, water will accumulate in the muscles, resulting in swelling. One should nourish bodily fluids and significantly support the spleen and stomach in order to maintain health.</p>
<p>(Note: Menstrual blood refers to the essence of yin blood and is related to the Chong and Ren meridians, producing milk above and menstrual flow below. Issues arise from spleen deficiency that prevents blood production, spleen stagnation that restricts blood flow, excess stomach heat that dissipates blood, deficiency of spleen and stomach leading to scant blood, emotional strain on the heart causing blood deficiency, liver damage from anger resulting in less blood, kidney water deficiency affecting liver blood production, and lung qi deficiency obstructing blood circulation.)<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>It is initially suggested that when a girl reaches fourteen and has her first menstruation, the Ren vessel is open, and if menstruation occurs regularly, she is capable of bearing children. The first menstruation is a natural phenomenon. The monthly cycle has its regularity. Any abnormalities in its arrival or absence are considered a disease. If the nutritive blood is depleted and unable to nourish the tissues, it will lead to hair loss, a pale face, emaciation, and dryness; excessive dryness allows the metal element to be invaded, which can then manifest as cough, phlegm, lung abscess, or lung atrophy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The foundation lies in qi and blood. When people are ill, they invariably first suffer a depletion of qi and blood. For young maidens and boys, excessive thoughts accumulate in the heart, leading to fatigue and harm. In men, this results in a waning spirit; in women, it causes a cessation of menstrual flow. Indeed, worry and overthinking damage the heart, causing blood to rebel and diminish, leading the spirit to scatter and menstrual flow to cease. Furthermore, a heart condition cannot nourish the spleen, hence loss of appetite; a weak spleen means impaired metal, causing cough; if kidney water is exhausted, wood energy cannot thrive, leading to dry and weak limbs, hence frequent anger, graying hair, and weak bones. Should the five organs be affected, death will follow. One can change their mind and resolve, and with medication to support health, one might preserve life. It is crucial not to use cooling blood-moving remedies such as Qinghao and Chuanjiao; it is better to use Baiziren Pill or Zexlan Decoction to nourish yin and blood and control false fire. </p>
<p>[Note: According to scripture, when the five grains enter the stomach, their dregs and fluids are divided into three channels, leading to qi accumulation in the chest, which exits through the throat, connecting the heart and lungs for respiration.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blood Depletion</strong></p>
<p>According to the discussion in the abdomen: There is a condition characterized by illness in the chest and flanks, causing fullness that hinders eating. When the illness advances, one first detects a fishy and foul odor, produces clear fluids, feels sluggish in the limbs, experiences dizziness, and has blood that intermittently flows from both front and back. This condition is termed &quot;blood depletion.&quot; It commonly occurs in youth due to significant blood loss, or from intoxication while engaging in sexual activity, which depletes the kidney and liver. The liver stores blood and receives ethereal nourishment from heaven, connecting through channels to the diaphragm and spreading to the flanks and ribs. If blood is lost and essence is depleted, the liver energy is damaged, leading to the liver&#39;s blood becoming arid and failing to nourish, resulting in fullness in the chest and flanks that hampers eating, thus producing the aforementioned fishy odor and clear fluids. If liver disease affects the lungs, one may cough up blood, feel fatigued in the limbs, experience dizziness, and see intermittent blood flow, all signs of liver pathology and blood depletion.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the previous symptoms arise due to improper diet or living habits leading to a weakened spleen and stomach, one should nourish the source of transformation and supplement with medications such as fish maw and other tonics. If the spleen is deficient and cold, preventing blood generation, it is advisable to bolster the fire of the life gate. Should one take drying medicines that generate internal heat and consume body fluids, it is essential to clear heat and nourish blood. If the spleen and stomach are deficient and energy and blood are weak, one should tonify the center and benefit energy. If the stomach is overheated, leading to blood depletion, it is essential to clear heat from the spleen and stomach. For issues with constipation or if urine is clear and smooth yet menstruation is absent, one should clear the fire in the meridians. If exertion has harmed the heart fire, causing dehydration of blood and absent menstruation, it is advisable to nourish the heart and replenish blood.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Women&#39;s menstrual flow occurs regularly once a month, known as the &quot;monthly sign.&quot; If it fails to come, it is due to wind and heat damaging the menstrual blood, causing it to become stagnant; or it may be affected by internal heat, with weakness in the spleen and stomach leading to inability to consume food. Without sufficient nourishment, the vital energy coalesces, resulting in a dry, yellowish skin without luster. Alternatively, if there is weakness in the intestines, it may lead to diarrhea that drains vital essence, causing infertility.</p>
<p>For young girls whose first menses have not yet begun, they belong to the Lesser Yin. Once the menses have commenced, they fall under the discussion of the Greater Yin; and if the menses cease, they belong to the Taiyin channel. </p>
<p>When a woman’s energy fills the meridians, if her menstruation is frequent and accompanied by pain below the navel, it is advisable to use a combination of peony and six ingredients. If menstrual flow is excessive without other symptoms, add one tael each of Huangqin and Baizhu to the Four Substance Decoction. If menstruation is coming on, accompanied by cramping pain in the abdomen, the Eight Substance Decoction should be taken. If the menstrual flow is significantly heavy, use four taels of the Four Substance Decoction and add one tael of Huangqin. If the blood resembles black bean broth, add one tael each of Huanglian and Huangqin to the Four Substance Decoction. If a woman has scanty menstrual flow but the blood color is healthy, use four taels of the Four Substance Decoction, with one tael each of Shudihuang and Danggui.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blood Exhaustion and Menstrual Cessation</strong></p>
<p>In youth, intoxication leads to the bedroom, causing exhaustion of energy and injury to the liver, thus menstruation diminishes and does not arrive. Injury to the liver leads to the drying up of blood, and the spleen and stomach cannot transmit it properly, resulting in a significant loss of blood. This causes dizziness and heart restlessness, which is why menstruation does not come; it is manifested by the roundness of the black fishbone.</p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Flow Appropriately Arrives and Stops</strong></p>
<p>For women, menstrual flow should come and go appropriately. If there are signs of cold and heat, first take Xiao Chai Hu to dispel that cold and heat, and then use Si Wu Tang for adjustment and treatment. If the cold and heat do not recede, do not take Si Wu Tang; this is termed a transformation of symptoms, indicating that the exterior pathogenic factor still exists and cannot be effective.</p>
<p><strong>Clarifying Theories</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Heat Enters the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>In cases of warm disease when heat enters the blood chamber, how can we clarify this? The &quot;chamber&quot; refers to a place of confinement. The blood chamber in the human body is where the nourishing blood resides and is the place where the meridians converge, namely the Chong Meridian. The Chong Meridian is one of the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, originating from below the kidneys, emerging at Qichong, and along the Yangming channel, it ascends to the chest and disperses, becoming the sea of the twelve meridians. Wang Bing states: &quot;Chong is the sea of blood,&quot; meaning that the blood of all the meridians converges here. In men, it facilitates the circulation of essence, whereas in women, it produces milk above and menstruation below. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;When the Ren Meridian is open and the Chong Meridian is abundant, menstruation occurs at the appropriate time.&quot; Wang Bing explains: &quot;Yin calms, the sea is full, and blood departs,&quot; indicating that the abundance of the Chong Meridian means that the sea is full. From this observation, we can understand that the Chong is indeed the blood chamber.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of cold damage (shanghan), for women it enters along the meridians, while for men it is transmitted from the Yangming. The influences affect the Chong vessel and the Shaoyin network originating from the kidneys. When women are affected by evil, it enters through the Taiyang meridian and directly into the Chong meridian and the Yangming of the legs. For men, internal heat of the Yangming allows the evil to enter. When the Chong vessel absorbs heat, blood must move erratically; for men, this manifests as blood leading to verbal disturbances, while for women, it corresponds with the menstrual flow. When men experience Yangming illness with blood leading to verbal disturbances, it indicates heat has entered the blood chamber; this applies broadly to men, not just to women. In women, when the cold damage occurs, if the menstrual flow comes or stops, it is due to the depletion of menstrual energy; the uterus is not closed off, allowing the evil to exploit this entry. The &quot;Divination of Acupuncture&quot; states: &quot;When the evil qi does not find an opening, it cannot harm a person alone.&quot; For women, when heat enters the blood chamber, some may require treatment for recovery, while others may recover without treatment; each case is different.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When periodic chills and fevers occur at times like malaria, it is due to blood congestion and stagnation. One should disperse it with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If there are lingering pathogens present, they must be treated. If a fever arises with menstruation arriving on schedule, clearly during the day and accompanied by vague speech at night, this indicates that with the arrival of menstruation, there are no lingering pathogens left; as long as one does not interfere recklessly, the heat will disperse with the blood and will naturally recover. The text states: &quot;Blood descends; when it descends, recovery occurs.&quot; Therefore, one should not disturb the stomach qi or the upper jiao, and recovery will happen on its own. Reckless interference refers to the fear that vague speech may be interpreted as an excess in the Yangming channel, thus attacking it and disturbing stomach qi; if there is no pathogen in the chest and flanks, one fears to needling the Qi men point, disturbing the middle jiao; if there is no blood congestion, one fears that Xiao Chai Hu Decoction will interfere with the upper jiao. When Xiao Chai Hu Decoction disperses, it moves the defensive qi, which originates from the upper jiao; thus, moving the defensive qi disturbs the upper jiao. Needling the Qi men also stimulates the nutritive qi, which arises from the middle jiao; thus, moving the nutritive qi disturbs the middle jiao.

<p>For women aged fifty and above, if there is a sudden menstrual flow, it is said that the menstrual blood reaches its full count at seventy-seven. Beyond that, a sudden flow occurs. The Inner Canon states that fire governs sudden occurrences, which may also be due to extreme joy, anger, worry, distress, or fright. Therefore, one must be cautious not to treat this as a cold illness. If treated with severe heat medicines, it may be fatal. One may only use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction to clear the upper parts, and then use lotus shell ash and palm hair to filter downward.

<p><strong>Delayed Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>For women who have delayed menstruation, the same is true for unmarried girls. The Inner Canon states that when menstruation does not come, it is due to the closure of the胞脉 (bao mai).

One may use tea to adjust a purging powder; after purging, one can utilize Yuzhu powder, Danggui powder, or Sanhe Decoction, Guiling Baizhu powder, and Chaihu Decoction, choosing according to the condition of excess and deficiency. The aim is to descend heart fire, nourish kidney water, stimulate appetite, balance yin and yang, and facilitate urination. Care must be taken to avoid harsh, heating medications. If taken, it may result in lung atrophy, bone steaming, tidal fever, cough with purulent sputum, vomiting blood and wheezing, difficulty in urination, persistent sweating during sleep, progressively leading to emaciation and a large pulse.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Three Causes of Menstrual Cessation</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Yin and Yang&quot; states: When diseases of the two Yang elements affect the heart and spleen, there may be hidden paths that become obstructed. If a woman does not have her monthly flow, this is referred to as &quot;wind consumed&quot; or &quot;breath of vitality ceases,&quot; and if untreated, it can lead to death. Women with prolonged deficiency of the spleen and stomach, or who are emaciated with weakened vital energy and blood, may experience a complete cessation of menstruation. This could also be due to heat digestion during illness, leading to gradual weakness and the absence of bodily fluids. The menstrual flow is produced from the transformation of blood and fluids; if these fluids are exhausted, and heat consumes them, the muscles will wither, thirst may arise, and the blood reservoir will be depleted. This condition is termed &quot;blood withered, menstruation ceased,&quot; and it is advisable to drain the stomach of its dry heat and to tonify vital energy and blood; the menstruation will then resume.</p>
<p>In some cases, the menstrual flow may be obstructed by pregnancy, and if the fetus is unsteady due to fetal disease, this can occur. If the pericardium pulse is abundant and rapid, accompanied by agitation, with constipation observed, and even though the urination seems clear, menstruation remains blocked and ceases. This indicates that the blood reservoir is dried up, and it is necessary to regulate the blood vessels and expel the internal fire evil from the pericardium to restore the menstrual flow.</p>
<p>The &quot;Internal Classic&quot; mentions that heat from the small intestine may move to the large intestine, resulting in stagnation or accumulation. When the pulse is shallow and obstructed, menstruation becomes stagnant and fails to flow, which is why it is described as stagnation or accumulation. Alternatively, overwork and heart fire rising may cause a delay in menstruation; calming the heart and harmonizing the blood, draining the fire will then allow for menstruation to resume. Thus, the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; states that when menstruation does not arrive, it is the blockage of the uterine vessels. These vessels are associated with the heart and connect within the uterus; currently, the energy pressing upward onto the lungs inhibits the heart’s energy from descending, which is why menstruation does not occur.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Lesser Yang</strong></p>
<p>For women’s ailments, when menstrual flow is disrupted, all are treated as Lesser Yang conditions, encompassing both cold and miscellaneous diseases. The classic texts state: when the body is ill and there is an external pathogen, the meridians are obstructed. Moreover, if the monthly cycle does not come, it signifies obstruction in the conception vessels. In cases where menstruation is obstructed, the pulse at the wrist fails to show, and when the conception vessel is obstructed, the source of life is cut off; both scenarios involve blood disorders, which are under the domain of the Jueyin. If one suffers from a Jueyin condition, it then becomes a Lesser Yang condition, and this can affect the husband as well. </p>
<p>The methods of treatment may involve creating intense heat or transforming into exhaustion; the pulse may exhibit both superficial and deep characteristics, requiring differing herbs for interior and exterior harmonization. One must assess whether the issues reside in qi or blood, and determine if they address Yin or Yang. It is essential that the dosages for both large and small are appropriately balanced, with light and heavy matters serving their place, considering reversals and urgency, managing everything without error, thus achieving total wellness. This method of treating Lesser Yang is vital knowledge.</p>
<p>In treating miscellaneous diseases, one must first harmonize the qi, followed by addressing various ailments, ensuring that the stomach qi remains unharmed—which is critical. If blood is affected, qi must still be adjusted first, as unharmonized qi means blood cannot circulate. Qi serves as the fundamental substance; it is like the husband. If the husband does not sing, the wife will not follow. Therefore, for women’s menstrual disorders, one begins with Chaihu to regulate the exterior of the menstrual cycle and then follows with the Four Substances to nourish the interior, prioritizing qi before blood.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Distinction of Purple and Black Painful Masses</strong></p>
<p>The menstrual flow is associated with Yin blood. Yin must derive from Yang, hence it is red, which embodies the color of fire. Blood is paired with Qi; when Qi is hot, it becomes hot, and when Qi is cold, it becomes cold. When Qi rises, it rises; when it descends, it descends; when Qi condenses, it condenses; when Qi stagnates, it stagnates; when Qi is clear, it is clear; when Qi is turbid, it is turbid. Often, masses are seen to form due to the condensation of Qi. Pain that occurs upon movement is due to the stagnation of Qi. Pain that arises afterward indicates deficiency in both Qi and blood. A pale color also signifies deficiency. Erratic movement of the menstrual flow indicates chaotic Qi. Purple indicates hot Qi, while black indicates extreme heat. People often see the purple, black, painful masses and hastily attribute them to wind and cold, treating them with warming remedies, leading to disaster. This is likely due to the theory in &quot;Sources of Disease,&quot; which states that all monthly conditions are said to be caused by wind and cold, making it a common practice. </p>
<p>Some say: Black is the color of northern water, and purple is lighter than black; how can it not be cold? I respond: The classics state that excess causes harm, and holding onto it must be controlled. When heat is excessive, it must also be accompanied by the transformation of water, thus the heat appears purple and extreme heat appears black. Moreover, women are inherently more reclusive and possess heightened desires; the yang fire of their organs is constantly active. How can this not be heat? As for wind and cold, they must be obtained from the outside; if they are present, it is but one in a thousand or one in two.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p>The text says: &quot;The illness of the two Yangs affects the heart and spleen, causing inability to conceal and resulting in women not menstruating.&quot; Those who explain this state that for men, the spleen is affected, leading to insufficient essence; for women, the heart is affected, causing a lack of menstrual flow. They divide the heart and spleen to argue that each gender has a distinct cause.</p>
<p>I privately disagree with this interpretation. The term &quot;two Yangs&quot; refers to Yangming, which pertains to the stomach and large intestine channels. When there is illness in the intestines and stomach, it affects the heart and spleen. &quot;Affecting the heart and spleen&quot; means that the influence extends to these organs. Indeed, the spleen and stomach are interrelated, so when there is a stomach ailment, it naturally impacts the spleen. However, the large intestine and heart are not usually interconnected; thus, why does a large intestine issue impact the heart? This is because the stomach is the organ of reception, while the large intestine is the organ of transformation and transmission.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Food enters the stomach, and the turbid qi returns to the heart; drink enters the stomach and is processed by the spleen. This is due to the stomach’s ability to receive and the intestines’ ability to transform. When the intestines and stomach are ill, they cannot receive or transform, and what then can the heart and spleen depend on? Once the heart and spleen have no resources to depend on, they cannot function to produce vital essence and blood. Thus, when the intestines and stomach are sick, the heart and spleen are affected, leading to men having low sperm production and women having irregular menstrual cycles. </p>
<p>The heart and spleen should be considered together; one should not divide the discussion by gender. Only in cases of hidden menstrual irregularities can one speak separately about men and women. If we follow the claims made by some monks, it suggests that male essence relies solely on the spleen and not on the heart, while female blood relies solely on the heart and not on the spleen. Is there any validity in this? In truth, both male essence and female blood are nourished through the balance of the five viscera and six bowels before they are formed, so can we really say that male essence relies on the spleen and female blood relies on the heart? The classics state that both men and women may suffer from heart and spleen diseases, but in men, this manifests as hidden issues affecting fertility, while in women, this presents as the absence of menstrual flow.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Heat Enters the Blood Chamber, Resulting in Chest Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What causes heat to enter the blood chamber and result in chest accumulation? I replied: The pathogenic qi enters the meridians as the master, causing the energies to clash and flow up and down. When it meets the menstrual flow, it disrupts it; the pathogenic qi then takes advantage of the weakness to enter the blood chamber. The blood, being forced by the pathogenic influence, enters the liver meridian. When the liver is affected by the pathogen, it leads to speech difficulties and hallucinatory experiences. This further enters the diaphragm, causing blood to accumulate in the chest. How do I explain this? A woman, in her normal state, has water nourishing wood and blood nourishing the liver. Before conception, this blood serves as menstruation; once pregnant, it is reserved to nurture the fetus. After giving birth, it is transformed to produce milk. All of these functions depend on blood. Now, when the pathogen drives out the blood and it returns to the liver meridian, it accumulates in the diaphragm and solidifies beneath the breast, hence causing pain upon touch. This condition cannot be treated with medicine; therefore, the point to be needled is Qimen.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Treatise: Adjusting the Menstrual Cycle</strong></p>
<p>The way before conception begins is to seek a child. The method for seeking a child must start with regulating the menstrual cycle. Whenever I observe women who are childless, their menstruation is often irregular—either early or late, too much or too little, accompanied by pain before or after menstruation, and the color could be purple, black, or pale, or the flow is thick and unregulated. If the cycle is unregulated, then the blood and vital energy conflict and cannot achieve conception. </p>
<p>Let us explore the causes of this lack of regulation: if the cycle is early or late, accompanied by pain after menstruation, it indicates deficiency; if the flow is scanty and pale, it signifies blood deficiency; if it is excessive, it points to Qi deficiency; if there is pain before the cycle and clots that do not disperse, it signifies stagnation. If the color is purple or black, it indicates stagnation combined with heat. </p>
<p>The treatment methods are as follows: for blood deficiency, one should use the Four Substances Decoction; for Qi deficiency, the same plus ginseng and astragalus; for stagnation, one may use Xiangfu, Sande, Muxiang, Bitao, Taoren, and Yanhuhua. For prolonged stagnation that has become entrenched, methods such as vomiting or purging may be necessary. For those with a pulse and symptoms of heat, add Huangqin and Lian; for those with a pulse and symptoms of cold, add Gui, Fu, and varieties of quartz. Only after removing stagnation and restoring deficiency can blood and Qi harmonize, allowing for conception.</p>
<p>Whenever I treat cases of irregular menstruation, just one ingredient, powdered Xiangfu, formed into pills and taken, achieves consistent success.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

When yin energy overtakes yang, the womb becomes cold due to this yin influence, leading to stagnant blood flow, which aligns with the concept that during cold weather, water freezes, hence the irregularities such as having a scanty flow after the period. Conversely, when yang energy overpowers yin, blood flows excessively and erratically; this occurs under hot conditions, where the menstrual flow is overly abundant, thus arriving before the expected time. It is essential to discern between yin and yang, harmonize blood and energy, preventing them from overpowering each other, ensuring a regular cycle.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Irregular Menstruation:</strong></p>
<p>If a woman&#39;s menstruation is irregular due to damage to the spleen and stomach, it should not be hastily interpreted as a case of menstrual cessation and blood stagnation. The use of drastic medicine to promote menstruation and break up blood clots should be avoided. In such cases, one must carefully assess the condition of the spleen and stomach. If the irregularity arises from diet and fatigue leading to damage to the spleen and stomach, characterized by poor appetite, bad food, diarrhea, and pain; or if it results from mistakenly taking purgative or depleting medications that affect the inner energy, leading to insufficient blood flow, then it is advisable to nourish the spleen and stomach. One can use bai zhu (Atractylodes) as the main ingredient, with fu ling (Poria), xiao yao (Peony), and assist with huang qi (Astragalus), gan cao (Licorice), chen pi ( dried tangerine peel), mai ya (Barley), chuan xiong (Szechuan Lovage), dang gui (Angelica), chai hu (Bupleurum), and other herbs. When the spleen is strong, it can generate blood and the menstruation will resume naturally. </p>
<p>In cases where food stagnation damages the spleen and stomach, one should also aim to resolve the stagnation and tonify the spleen. If there are no issues with the spleen and stomach but indeed blood clots are formed, only then should one consider promoting blood circulation and regulating menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When both the heart and spleen are in harmony, all the organs and tissues are nourished, and menstrual conditions are normal. However, if the heart and spleen are harmed, blood will not be nourished nor regulated, leading to menstrual irregularities. Thus, when regulating menstruation, the focus should be on harmonizing the heart and spleen, as previously discussed in &quot;Liang Fang&quot; under the section on irregular menstruation. Generally, methods to regulate menstruation include: if liver and spleen blood is dry, focus on Si Wu Decoction; if liver and spleen blood is weak, focus on Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; if there is liver qi stagnation with heat, focus on Gui Pi Decoction; and if there is liver anger and heat, focus on a modified Xiao Yao San. The causes of illness are varied and cannot be exhaustively listed; treatment should be adaptable to each individual case.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming - Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Menstrual Irregularities</strong></p>
<p>Women are governed by blood; when the true essence descends, the Yin and Yang merge, the kidney energy is fully prosperous, and the blood circulates. This typically occurs once every three weeks, symbolizing the waxing and waning of the moon, thus referred to as menstruation. The flow of menstruation and postpartum recovery are similar; if there is residual blood remaining after the period, or if exposed to wind, cold, damp, heat, or harmful energies, or if internally injured by cold, or if emotional disturbances cause stagnation, it may result in phlegm or blood stasis. This condition is termed blood stagnation. </p>
<p>After menstruation, excessive exertion, too much intimacy, or ingestion of heated, dry foods can provoke fire, strengthen the harmful energies, and deplete essence and blood, leading to what is called blood depletion. The text &quot;Good Formulas&quot; states: if startled after menstruation, the blood and energy can become chaotic and might reverse; if it moves upwards, it may exit through the mouth and nose, and if it moves downwards, it can lead to water accumulation. Anger causes the energy and blood to rebel, resulting in severe pain in the waist, legs, heart, abdomen, back, flanks, hands, and feet. When menstruation occurs, symptoms arise; if overdue, they stop. Extreme anger damages the liver, resulting in dizziness, vomiting of blood, scrofula, blood wind, sores, and ulcers. Moreover, if menstrual blood leaks, it can create sores in the orifices, causing non-stop dripping; when damp heat combines, it may cause excessive menstruation; when blood stagnates internally, it leads to symptomatic masses. </p>
<p>All these varied symptoms stem from mere blood stagnation and depletion. However, blood stagnation can also have conditions of false heat, and blood depletion can likewise indicate false heat. Thus, severe cases can lead to amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). In terms of stagnation and depletion, mild cases will show menstrual irregularities, while solely considering deficiency and heat respectively.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For blood stagnation and menstrual blockage that should be resolved, the causes are dietary heat and toxins, or excessive anger causing condensation of blood and phlegm. One must use substances like rhubarb and related herbs to promote transformation, allowing old blood to dissipate and new blood to be generated. If vigorous energy depletes the blood due to overwork and worry, it is better to nourish gently and harmoniously. If there is also phlegm, fire, or damp heat present, it is essential to clear and cool these conditions. Cinnamon is often used as an adjunct because it promotes blood circulation when there is heat, but one must not take harsh drugs that harm the Yin. Regarding the theory of depleting Qi while enhancing blood, although it is essential in gynecology, blood is paired with Qi. When Qi is hot, the blood is hot; when Qi is cold, the blood is cold; when Qi rises, it rises; when Qi descends, it descends; when Qi circulates, it circulates; when Qi stagnates, it stagnates. If there is accumulated fire energy in the blood, one may use Xiao Feng San or Qi regulating powder, supplemented with aromatics, areca nut, and bitter orange peel to open the stagnation and move the Qi.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the qi is disturbed, it must be regulated; when the qi is cold, it needs warmth; when the qi is weak, it should be replenished; this applies to both men and women. Indeed, when the yang is strong, the yin naturally grows; when the qi is depleted, the blood will also decrease. Can one solely exhaust their qi? Many scholars mistakenly follow Shuhe, who argues that strong blood leads to weak qi, not realizing that Shuhe discusses the liver and lung meridians, implying that the liver should be strong compared to the lungs; in truth, a balance of qi and blood is necessary for conception, hence the saying, &quot;the two organs must be harmonized.&quot; Yet women often face bias, and their aspirations remain unfulfilled. They frequently experience pent-up emotions and anger; thus, Xiangfu is considered a miraculous herb for women. The classics state: when pathogenic qi is excessive, there is fullness; when the right qi is lacking, there is emptiness. Must one not understand this? </p>
<p>During menstruation, if one experiences wind and cold entering the body, it can lead to stagnation and clotted blood; a slight warming medicinal soup is recommended. If menstruation is accompanied by a sudden onset of cold and heat, resulting in a blockage, whether it is cold or heat, it is all referred to as heat entering the blood chamber; one can use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Sheng Di Huang, or Huang Qin Shao Yao Tang with Sheng Di Huang.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one suffers from cold due to eating cold food or being exposed to dampness, leading to the stagnation of blood, one should use Wujisan with Mahuang, Mudanpi, and Honghua.

<p>For internal injuries from diet, overexertion, or weakness of the spleen and stomach, wherein one feels fatigue, has fever, abdominal pain, and reduced appetite without producing blood, one should take Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with Chuanxiong, Shengdihuang, and Tianhuafen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Miscarriage and excessive childbirth harm the blood, or mistakenly taking medicines that induce sweating and purging may lead to diminished blood flow and lack of energy. In such cases, use the Shiquan Dabu decoction. </p>
<p>If menstruation becomes irregular, with diminishing blood flow leading to stagnation, this is referred to as &quot;blood desiccation.&quot; The root cause is insufficient emotional balance, which prevents the spleen from properly digesting food, causing a deficiency in lung nourishment and stagnant energy. Additionally, the kidneys&#39; water element becomes deficient, leading to further depletion of blood over time. Initially, symptoms may include intermittent dripping; if the spleen and stomach become significantly weakened, it may develop into diarrhea and bodily swelling. If left untreated, this can lead to serious conditions such as abdominal masses and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In summary, if menstruation is obstructed, without the presence of excessive heat, phlegm, or qi stagnation, the situation is generally similar. Adjust treatments according to the symptoms and harmonize diet to ensure the smooth flow of blood and energy. If there is significant stagnation, remedies such as Honghua Danggui powder, Ziqi powder, Tongjing pills, or Daojing pills may be used. For those with deficiencies, simply using Danggui powder to promote circulation is essential; afterward, it is necessary to nourish the blood and enhance yin to ensure fluid circulation. If one neglects to nourish qi and blood, relying solely on toxic medications for forceful treatment will certainly lead to death.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is effective vomiting, the energy rises; when there is diarrhea, the essence flows to the back; when there is pain, it is a sudden obstruction in the middle. Therefore, one must first eliminate the illness before nourishing the blood and regulating the menstrual cycle. Among the conditions of tidal fever and pain, these are particularly common among women. This is due to blood stasis accumulating in the bone marrow, which leads to bone steaming; blood stasis accumulating and stagnating in the middle, conflicting with the daily generation of new blood, results in pain; if the blood is insufficient to nourish the whole body, it causes steaming heat externally; if the blood is insufficient and enveloped by excessive fire, or combined with phlegm, qi, or food stagnation, as well as external cold pathogens, it results in pain. </p>
<p>Tidal fever can occur at times due to internal injuries or deficiency; if it occurs at all times, it is due to external influences or excess. For deficiency, one should use the Great Warming Decoction; for heat, use the Four Substance Decoction with additional Chai Hu and Qin Pi; for menstrual obstruction, use the Blood Nourishing Decoction; for bone steaming, the Great Hu Lian Pill or the Great Black Chicken Pill.

<p>For pain before and after menstruation, one can use a combination of Jiao Jia Di Huang pills, Zi Yin Bai Bu pills, and Qi Zhi Xiang Fu pills. </p>
<p>Menstrual blood is a remnant of the meridians; when the Chong and Ren meridians are harmonized, blood flows down as it should. Worries and thoughts weaken the heart blood, leading to fiery heat and the blood not returning to the liver, impairing its capacity for storage and circulation. If the mother fails to nourish the child, the spleen lacks refinement, leading to reduced appetite. With less food intake, the lung’s metal element fails to receive nourishment, cutting off the source of water and life, resulting in irregular menstrual flow. </p>
<p>Those treating should know that the heart governs qi and blood; when heart qi is stagnant, it is essential to regulate heart blood, allowing it to flow through the heart channels. The spleen and stomach regulate the circulation of qi and blood; overexertion and diet issues damage internal qi, leading to insufficient blood flow. If it flows intermittently, treatments like Ping Wei San or Si Jun Zi Tang should be applied to nourish the spleen and stomach, restoring the generation and movement of qi and blood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Distinction of Male and Female in Vital Gate</strong></p>
<p>Men store essence through this, while women tether their wombs. Men&#39;s essence is primarily influenced by Qi, with the Kan water in action, hence the steam becomes essence and appears white; in the presence of fire, it may also appear red. Women, on the other hand, are primarily governed by blood, with the Li fire in action, hence their blood fills and manifests as menstruation, appearing red; if phlegm is present, menstruation may appear white.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction in Blood Chamber between Men and Women</strong></p>
<p>In men&#39;s blood chambers, there is no accumulation and thus no fullness; in women&#39;s blood chambers, there is accumulation that overflows as menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Method</strong></p>
<p>A floating pulse with a weak quality indicates fullness in the sides and leads to obstruction in menstruation. This refers to the liver pulse. Weakness in liver blood causes fullness in the sides, resulting in coagulated blood and obstructed menstruation. A floating, empty pulse harms essence and leads to amenorrhea. This refers to the kidney pulse. Seeing this pulse indicates loss of essence in men and menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea in women. </p>
<p>For menstrual disorders, the pulse is soft as usual. Although the pulse at the cun position is balanced, there is pain in the chi position. A deep, slow, and weak pulse indicates excess; a caution for many incoming issues. A slightly deficient pulse is unbeneficial; what harm is there in intervals between months? If the floating and sinking are equal and slightly late or weak, after three months, the Qi and blood are insufficient. After more than three months, amenorrhea becomes difficult to handle. If there are heart and spleen issues, the floating is absent at the cun position. If the heart is insufficient, the left cun feels firm and knotty. </p>
<p>In general, a woman&#39;s pulse is often more moist and weak than a man&#39;s. A pulse that feels normal, even if menstruation is earlier or later, whether it be more or less, or even absent for a month, does not constitute a menstruation disorder.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse at the inch is normal, while the pulse at the cubit is absent or weak; if it does appear, it is faint. This indicates accumulation and pain in the lower abdomen and digestive system, with an urgent sensation in the heart, and the menstrual flow is not smooth. If the pulse is deep and slow, it suggests deficiency below, leading to abundant menstruation. If it is slightly weak and does not lead to sweating, the menstrual cycle will definitely come after two months, commonly referred to as a missed period. When the three positions fluctuate and one remains still, the inch pulse is slightly slippery, indicating a weak stomach qi, the slippery nature shows insufficient fluids and blood. If the cubit pulse is slightly weak and slow, it suggests a lack of fluids; retreating reveals cold within the yin, indicating retention in the cycle. </p>
<p>If the menstruation occurs once every three months, it may become scanty and not flow later, particularly for those who have experienced miscarriage or multiple births, this is referred to as blood exhaustion. The classic texts state that diseases of the two yang affect the heart and spleen, causing obstruction in their pathways, thus a woman misses her period. This occurs due to insufficient heart energy, leading to a lack of spleen function in digestion, causing the lung metal to lose nourishment, which cannot produce the needed fluid for the limbs, resulting in daily depletion of blood. Initially presenting with a profuse and untimely discharge; if the spleen and stomach are significantly weakened, this can turn into diarrhea with body swelling. If neglected, it can lead to serious conditions like tumors and consumption. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Diagnosis and Inquiry of Menstrual Issues</h3>
<p>Menstrual issues may indicate either blood heat or blood deficiency; or during menstruation, there may be external factors that cause the symptoms to dissipate after the cycle ends. One should not use medication recklessly, as it may lead to complications with the blood sea. If menstruation is absent, it may be accompanied by symptoms such as tidal fever, coughing, diarrhea, blood loss, or white discharge. If one can eat properly, the blood can be regulated, and the symptoms will resolve on their own. However, gradual loss of appetite and weight can be concerning.</p>
<h3>Heat Entering the Blood Chamber Causes Chest Tightness</h3>
<p>Zhongjing&#39;s writings on cold damage do not distinguish between genders, but for women, blood plays a central role. The blood chamber refers to the Chong meridian and blood sea. If there is fever from cold damage coinciding with the menstrual cycle such that it is clear during the day but leads to confusion or delirium at night, this is termed &#39;internal heat due to blood stagnation.&#39; When menstruation ends, the heat subsides with the blood, and if untreated, it may heal on its own. However, if the heat diminishes and the body feels cool, yet there is a sensation of fullness in the chest like tightness, or if confusion continues, it indicates that pathogenic energy has settled in the chest and side. If palpation causes pain, this is also referred to as chest tightness due to blood stagnation, and remedies such as Hai Ge San or Gui Zhi Hong Hua Tang should be applied. </p>
<p>For women who suffer from cold damage with alternating chills and fever, and menstruation suddenly halts, this is termed &#39;heat entering the blood chamber,&#39; which leads to stagnation of blood. In such cases, Xiao Chai Hu Tang or Huang Long Tang with additions of Mu Dan Pi and Tao Ren may be effective. This condition is primarily seen in women, and inducing sweating or purging should be avoided. If there is excessive joy or delirium, and abdominal distention is noted, it is advisable to use blood-letting techniques; however, one should not be constrained by the notion that menstruation must occur. Both genders have a blood sea, and if men experience heat in the blood chamber, it may lead to reckless behavior resulting in blood loss and confusion—observations marked by symptoms typical of the Yangming syndrome. Men are often affected through the Yangming, while women are influenced by their menstrual cycle.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Moon Water</strong></p>
<p>Women are of the yin category, with blood as their primary substance. Their blood responds to the moon, reflecting its phases, and corresponds with tidal movements—both the moon&#39;s waxing and waning and the tides&#39; ebb and flow. The menstrual cycle occurs monthly, in harmony with the moon, hence it is called lunar trust, lunar water, and menstrual cycle. The term &quot;cycle&quot; signifies regularity and established patterns. The &quot;heavenly essence&quot; refers to the life-giving water of heaven. Some practitioners erroneously refer to this as &quot;red lead,&quot; which is a misnomer. </p>
<p>A woman’s menstrual cycle occurs monthly as per her natural condition. Variations may arise, with issues such as delayed or obstructed flow indicating illness. Moreover, there are changes in regularity that ancient texts did not address and that should not be overlooked. Some may experience menstrual flow accompanied by spotting or bleeding from the eyes, which is referred to as irregular flow. Others may have a cycle every three months or may never cycle while conceiving, classified as &quot;hidden menstruation.&quot; After conception, if a woman menstruates monthly and gives birth, this is termed a &quot;prosperous fetus,&quot; commonly referred to as a &quot;dirty fetus.&quot; If months pass with significant bleeding yet the fetus does not abort, it is considered a &quot;leaky fetus.&quot; Although these situations pertain to the abundance or deficiency of qi and blood, they still deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, her heavenly essence manifests, and at twenty-one, it ceases, which is typical. There are accounts of girls aged twelve or thirteen becoming pregnant, as recorded in &quot;Records of the Chusan Family,&quot; noting a girl from Jiangsu who conceived at twelve. There are also instances of women in their fifties or sixties giving birth, as mentioned in the &quot;History of Liao,&quot; where a woman over sixty bore two sons and a daughter, which is indeed an exceptional case.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Physicians should pay attention to this matter. When women menstruate, the foul, unpleasant fluids are dangerous, thus the noble should avoid them for their impurity, as they can harm the Yang and cause illness. Those who prepare decoctions for medicinal purposes, those who practice inoculation, and those who cultivate sexual harmony, all should refrain from such practices for this reason. The &quot;Boweizhi&quot; states that the country of Funan has a strange technique that prevents blades from cutting; if the blade is coated with menstruation water, it will perish. This is the foul fluid that harms the spirit, hence all medicinal substances should avoid contact with it. This claim is well supported. Nowadays, there are charlatans and sorcerers luring the foolish with tricks, using laws to obtain young maidens upon their first menstruation, calling it &quot;primal red lead.&quot; They concoct names and recipes, linking it to the &quot;Golden Flowers&quot; of the &quot;Certificate of Mutual Assurance,&quot; and the primary scripture of the &quot;Wuzhen Pian,&quot; referring to the same thing. Foolish individuals believe them, consuming the foul residues thinking they possess secret formulas, often leading to the emergence of ailments, which is truly lamentable. Thus, Xiao Liao&#39;s poem on the true gold elixir states: &quot;Those of the lower path have a nature inclined to indulgence, forcefully seeking to gather the Yang from others&#39; Yin. Holding the heavenly essence in the mouth, it is called a remedy, yet it seems a futile effort.&quot; One can derive wisdom from this. </p>
<p>For women experiencing amenorrhea, there are signs of excess and deficiency. Excess indicates stagnant blood, while deficiency suggests liver injury. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: &quot;When young, if there has been significant blood loss, or if one drunkenly enters a room, the Qi is exhausted and the liver harmed, hence the monthly cycle diminishes and may cease. Treat it with four fish bones and one Zhi jiao herb.&quot; This pertains to the sickness of blood blockage due to deficiency.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Menstrual Irregularities and Identification of Stagnant Blood</strong></p>
<p>Zhongjing treats menstrual irregularities with abdominal fullness and pain. If the menstruation occurs again in a month, use the Earth Gourd Root Powder. This remedy is designed to break down stubborn blood stagnation, indicating that menstruation is delayed due to stagnant blood. This was not previously discussed. To identify stagnant blood, one must differentiate between fullness and pain in the lower abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Dongyuan and Jiegugu&#39;s Method for Treating Blood Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>Both Dongyuan and Jiegugu&#39;s methods for treating blood deficiency focus on nourishing the blood and clearing heat. To nourish blood, remedies like the Four Substance Decoction are used. For clearing heat, Dongyuan classifies the conditions into three regions: if heat is in the middle, it leads to good appetite with thirst; treatment involves regulating the stomach with substances like Chengqi. If heat is in the lower part, causing constipation, it is treated with substances like Yuzhu, which is equal parts of the Four Substances and Chengqi. If heat is in the upper area, resulting from overthinking, it is treated with herbs like Qín and Lián, along with Sanhe. Sanhe is a mixture of the Four Substances, Cool the Diaphragm, and Donggui. Jiegugu states that one should first take calming heart fire remedies, also including Qín, Lián, Sanhe, and Yuzhu; then, one should take five nourishing remedies for health, which also include energizing agents.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Menstrual Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Purple and Black Flow</strong></p>
<p>When the external pathogen first affects, there must be pain. If there is no pain, over time it will accumulate and transform into heat. Moreover, cold leads to stagnation, thus resulting in a purple-black flow; it is not due to cold.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pain During Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Menstruation involves the movement of qi and blood, connecting yin and yang, and nourishing the body. When qi and blood are abundant and yin and yang are balanced, the body is unimpeded. However, if the protective qi is insufficient to nourish, and there is a lack of blood to irrigate internally, then when the qi and blood are insufficient, menstruation may come, leading to pain in the body first.</p>
<p><strong>3. Delay Beyond Period</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Chuan Bao,&quot; a man born in the year of the Tiger belongs to wood, with yin present in yang, hence he obtains the number eight. A woman born in the year of the Monkey belongs to metal, with yang present in yin, hence she obtains the number seven. Men are governed by qi; once the eight is complete, the number is exhausted, and this leads to weakness in yang essence. Women are governed by blood; once the seven is complete, the number is finished, leading to cessation of menstruation. When the Chong meridian is vacuous and weak, if the celestial and earthly pathways are unconnected, then there will be no offspring. Sometimes, excessive labor or mismanagement of emotions, during the time when the meridians become weak, can result in attacks by pathogenic qi, causing menstruation to not stop and leading to flooding.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Women&#39;s Secret Medicine</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Wanquan</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Treatise</strong></p>
<p>Yin and Yang are fundamentally different; men and women are of different categories. There are specialized treatments for different ailments, aimed at alleviating deep-seated illnesses in women. Menstruation arrives like the tides at its due time; the blood flow is ever-present, resembling the continuous waves of a river. When deemed without illness, one may forgo medicine. Yet, if it comes early before its time, the qi may be excessive and the blood can easily diminish; if it comes late, the qi may be insufficient, and the blood weak from the beginning. If the floral essence is faint, it indicates a deficiency in the blood&#39;s water; if the peach waves are purple, it shows the fire scorching the womb. If menstruation hasn’t occurred and there’s abdominal pain, it suggests qi stagnation and blood clumping which can be adjusted; if menstruation has occurred and there’s abdominal pain, it necessitates harmony in qi and nurturing the blood without errors. </p>
<p>Menstruating twice in a month indicates an invasion of fiery pathogens prompting qi and blood not to hold; menstruating once in several months results from depletion of original qi, leading to insufficient transformation. These are all signs of true deficiency, where balance and treatment are of utmost importance. Fullness without discharge means amenorrhea, blood desiccation, or the presence of masses; discharge without fullness signifies menorrhagia, leukorrhea, or profuse flow. Those who are consistently full dread the fullness within; those who frequently discharge worry about the loss of qi. The pulse loves to feel empty and weak, while diagnosis should avoid the excessive and rapid. Those who endure pain silently exacerbate their ailments; foolish women hasten their demise. Prematurely attacking with tonics may worsen the conditions; incompetent physicians may inadvertently worsen the afflictions.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>According to the classics: when a girl reaches the age of fourteen, her menstruation begins, marking the onset of her reproductive capability. Hence, when the cycles are regular, it indicates good health, and one should not rashly use medicines to regulate the cycles. If menstruation occurs before or after the expected time, if it happens twice in ten months, if it appears only once over several months, if it ceases completely, if there is excessive bleeding, or if there are unusual discharges, all these conditions indicate a disruption of regular cycles and require adjustment.</p>
<p>Generally, the methods of treatment are as follows: if there is heat, clear it; if there is cold, warm it; if there is deficiency, tonify it; if there is stagnation, move it; if there is excess, solidify it; if there is descent, elevate it. Treatment should be administered based on the diagnosis, aiming for balance. For example, Qinghao, Lian, Zhi, and Bai are cooling herbs; ginger, cassia, Ding, and Fu are warming herbs; ginseng, Jizhu, Angelica, and Fu are tonifying herbs; Chuanxiong, Xiangfu, Qingpi, and Yanhusuo are herbs for moving stagnation; oyster, red stone fat, palm ash, and arborvitae leaves are for solidifying essence; and Shengma, Chaihu, Jingjie, and Baizhi are for elevating. When used according to the symptoms, effectiveness is rarely lacking.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are three reasons for irregular menstrual cycles in women:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spleen deficiency</li>
<li>Damage to the chong and ren vessels</li>
<li>Phlegm and fat accumulation</li>
</ol>
<p>In treating diseases, one must examine these conditions carefully. For those with weakened spleen and stomach: it is said that diseases of the two yang (the yangming and the stomach) manifest in the heart and spleen, leading to women not having their monthly cycles. The two yang refer to the yangming stomach, which is responsible for receiving and nourishing grains, fostering blood and qi, irrigating the organs, and facilitating circulation. It is the sea of food and the mother of blood and qi. However, worry and excessive thinking harm the heart. If the heart qi is damaged, the splenic qi cannot be nourished, leading to stagnation and blockage. Although the stomach can still receive food, it fails to perform its nourishing and irrigating functions, resulting in the loss of vital commands. Consequently, spleen and stomach deficiency leads to reduced appetite, gradual depletion of qi and blood, and conditions such as blood stagnation, pale complexion, delayed menstruation, and irregular cycles every few months. </p>
<p>As for damage to the chong and ren vessels: it is said that gathering and exhaling influences blood and its nourishment. Therefore, when qi flows, blood flows; when qi is stagnated, blood becomes stagnant as well.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The nature of women is obstinate and impulsive, prone to anger and jealousy, which harms the liver qi. The liver is the sea of blood; when the channels are obstructed, blood and qi will run awry. Moreover, Zhu states: If a woman&#39;s blood has not yet flowed but is forced, it can lead to misnamed ailments later on. Thus, if a man forcibly associates with a woman before she reaches the age of fourteen or during her menstrual period, it can cause internal injury leading to unregulated blood flow, and if this happens for two cycles, it can result in a miscarriage or leakage. </p>
<p>As for phlegm and fat accumulation, a woman&#39;s body should have open internal pathways, with no obstructions, while externally, the menstrual channels should flow smoothly, allowing for timely blood and qi. However, those who are overweight and full of fat have their foundational doors blocked, and if phlegm obstructs, the tides of the blood sea do not flow. Therefore, one may have delayed menstruation, experience minimal flow for several months, or suffer from abnormal discharges, menstrual obstructions, or infertility.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

<p>If one&#39;s virtues are gentle and there are no diseases, the issue is attributed to insufficient qi and blood; use the Four Herbs and Four Noble Herbs, along with ginger and jujube.

If one is thin and has no other ailments, it is due to both qi and blood being insufficient; thus, use the Ten Complete Nourishing formula, along with ginger and jujube. If one is thin and eats little, it suggests a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to weakened qi and little blood; use Yigong powder with Tanggui and Chuanxiong soup as the main treatment, and also take Dihuang pills. If one is overweight or consumes excessive food, the issue is due to damp phlegm stagnation and limbs feeling cold; use Liu Junzi with Guixiong soup as the main treatment, and also take Cangsha pills. If one typically has a lot of phlegm, the cause is a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to poor nourishment of qi and blood; use Shenxiong Dabu pills and Dihuang pills. If one is impatient and frequently angry, the liver is injured, affecting the Chong and Ren vessels; use the Four Herbs with Chaihu soup as the main treatment, and also take Biyin pills to exhaust the fire from Chong and Ren. If one has previously taken warming and spicy medicines, use the Four Herbs with Huangbai and Zhimu soup alongside Sanbu Jiu as the main treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a thin person has scant menstrual flow, it is attributed to deficiency of blood. The treatment is to use a decoction of Four Substances with added ginseng. In the case of a fat person with scant menstrual flow, it is due to phlegm and congestion in the meridians; the remedy should be a decoction of Two Elected Herbs with added chuanxiong and angelica. If there is excessive menstrual flow regardless of body type, it indicates heat in the body; the treatment should be a decoction of Four Substances with added scutellaria and honeysuckle, along with the Three Replenishing Pills. If the menstrual blood is purple, it signifies heat, and one should use a decoction of Four Substances with added cyperus and scutellaria. If the menstrual blood is pale, it indicates deficiency, and the remedy should be the Eight Substances Decoction, along with the frequent use of Rehmannia Pills. All the above methods of regulating the menstrual cycle should be applied during the time of expected menstruation, taking them continuously for more than ten doses, and the next cycle will be unfaltering. If using pills, they should be taken for a prolonged period for effectiveness.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for amenorrhea in women:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When menstrual flow is absent due to damage to the spleen and stomach, leading to reduced appetite and depletion of qi and blood, the approach should be to nourish the spleen and stomach and replenish qi and blood, so that the qi can fill and promote the generation of blood, allowing menstruation to resume. One must not rashly use agents that promote menstruation, as this can further harm the central qi and dry up the yin blood, leading to diseases like tuberculosis that are beyond remedy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When menstrual flow does not occur due to emotional disturbances such as sadness, anxiety, anger, or resentment, which can cause qi stagnation and blood stasis, the treatment should focus on regulating stagnated qi and promoting the movement of blood, allowing menstruation to resume. Using tonics in this case would result in the qi being nourished but leading to further accumulation, and blood becoming more congealed, causing conditions like masses and abdominal distension.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When there is a physical block due to excessive body fat, leading to stagnation of phlegm and fluids which prevents menstruation, the treatment should aim to regulate qi and resolve phlegm, thus allowing the menstrual flow to occur. This is what is known as skilled practice.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p>

<p>For those experiencing amenorrhea with fever, dry throat, and dry lips, and an excess pulse, use the Four Substances Decoction and Cool the Diaphragm Powder as the main treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Regulating Menstruation with the Four Substances Decoction</strong></p>
<p>For women with irregular menstrual cycles, the Four Substances Decoction serves as the primary formula, which may be adapted accordingly. This is because the true essence of the boundless, the refined energies of the two-fives, harmonize beautifully. The male is formed through the dry (yang) path, while the female is formed through the moist (yin) path. Women, operating under the moist path, necessitate a focus on yin when treating them. When the cycles of twenty-seven days come around and the celestial essence arrives, and menstruation occurs at the right time, women receive the yin energy from the moist path; within yin, there must also be yang. Thus, the cycle of menstruation is marked by seven: one seven signals the change of teeth, and two sevens indicate the arrival of the celestial essence. </p>
<p>Humans receive the energies of heaven and earth to live, thus they can be affected by these forces. The moon represents the yin of heaven; it waxes and wanes, which is why the blood of women also follows a thirty-day cycle, hence the term &quot;monthly affair.&quot; The classic states that menstruation occurs on time, enabling conception. Therefore, for those with irregular cycles, this formula is appropriate as a base, allowing for adjustments based on cold, heat, deficiency, or excess. When the menstrual cycle is balanced, yin and yang harmonize, and all things flourish, leading to the ability to conceive. </p>
<p>The ingredients of this formula—Chuanxiong, Danggui, Shaoyao, and Dihuang—are all rich in essence. The richness corresponds to the deepest yin, thus they enhance blood. Analyzing further, Danggui is spicy and warm, invigorating the blood; Shaoyao is sour and cold, helping to astringe blood; while Shudihuang is sweet and moistening, capable of replenishing blood.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

As for Chuanxiong, it circulates the energy within the blood both upward and downward. These four substances are essential medicines for women, and for regulating menstruation, they must be used as the main ingredients. A rapid pulse with purple-black blood indicates internal heat; in this case, add Huangqin and Huanglian. A slow pulse with blood stagnation indicates cold; here, add Guangui and Fuzi. For those who are overweight with phlegm, add Banxia, Chenpi, and Nansheng. For those who are thin with fire, add Shanzhi, Huangbo, and Zhimu. For those with depression, add Xiangfu, Cangzhu, Sharen, and Shenqu. For those with stagnation, add Taoren, Honghua, Yanhusuo, and Rougui. A late period indicates heat, while an early period indicates cold, depression, air, or phlegm. For those with qi deficiency, add Ren and Qiyi; for those with excess qi, add Zhi and Pu. Someone might ask if there are circumstances where the four substances are not suitable. I would say: Yes, there are. If the breath is weak, Chuanxiong should not be used, as its pungent aroma could further disperse the genuine qi. If there is diarrhea, Angelica should not be used, as it is moist and slippery and could increase the downward flow. If the pulse is slow with abdominal pain, Peony should not be used, as it is sour and cold and could increase internal cold. If there is chest constriction, cooked rehmannia should not be used, as it is thick and greasy and could increase dampness.

<p>The meridians are the essence of women.</p>
<p>The ancient Text on Natural Purity states: When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, the essence of her yin comes, the Ren meridian opens, and the Chong meridian is abundant, leading to the regular onset of menstruation, hence the ability to conceive. The essence of heaven refers to the postnatal yin energy; when the yin energy is sufficient and menstruation is regular, this is what is called the menstrual cycle. Because the female body is associated with yin, it responds to the moon, which waxes and wanes over three ten-day periods, while menstruation arrives regularly, hence it is referred to as the menstrual cycle or monthly trust. The term &quot;cycle&quot; means regularity; if there is any disruption, one loses their regular rhythm, leading to various ailments. Furthermore, since the cycle is fundamentally composed of yin blood, which is present in all organs, the blood from the organs converges in the Chong meridian, which is considered the reservoir of the blood of the five organs and six bowels. Therefore, the statement that when the Chong meridian is abundant, menstruation arrives on time shows that the Chong meridian is the essence of the menstrual cycle.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The transformation of blood and qi depends on food and hydration. When food and hydration are abundant, blood and qi are also abundant; when they diminish, blood and qi diminish as well. The sea of food and hydration is located in the Yangming region. According to the Treatise on Atrophy, Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, and it governs the nourishment of the connective tissues. The Chong vessel is the sea of the meridians, responsible for nourishing the streams and valleys, and it converges with Yangming at the connective tissues. The meeting of yin and yang at the connective tissues occurs at Qi Street, where Yangming dominates. Thus, both male essence and female blood descend from the front yin. It can be seen that the blood of the Chong vessel is entirely transformed from the food and hydration of Yangming, and the qi of the Yangming stomach is the foundation of the Chong vessel. Therefore, the essence of menstruation relies heavily on the Chong vessel, the stomach qi, and the heart and spleen; they are the source of generation and transformation. Other factors such as the seven emotions, six excesses, improper diet, and lifestyle discrepancies are nothing but thieves of heart, spleen, and stomach qi. One should discern what to pay attention to and what to eliminate, and learners should understand where to start from.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Causes of Diseases in the Meridians and Organs</p>
<p>Women are primarily governed by blood; when blood is abundant, the meridians are regulated, and offspring can be produced. The prosperity or decline of the body begins from this point. Therefore, in treating women&#39;s diseases, one must prioritize menstrual blood. In ancient medical texts, it is stated that the heart governs blood, the liver stores blood, and the spleen regulates blood; thus, any injury to the heart, spleen, or liver can result in meridian disorders. Furthermore, it is said that the kidneys are the deepest aspect of yin, governing closure, while the liver represents the more outward aspect of yin, governing the dispersal. Both organs possess a mutual fire that is associated with the heart; thus, when heart fire is disturbed, this mutual fire reacts, often leading to erratic blood flow. This is one explanation. However, erratic flow can also arise from excessive fire. If the central qi is deficient or if the gateways are unstable, erratic flow can occur as well, resulting from the deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, which cannot solely be attributed to fire. Additionally, if the qi pathway is obstructed and fails to move, this is due to liver stagnation. If the essence and blood are depleted and unable to move, this results from the exhaustion of true yin, with numerous associated symptoms that should not be mistakenly attributed to stagnation. Thus, these conditions clearly pertain to diseases of the heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys, while the lung is often less discussed; yet, one must recognize that the movement or stagnation of blood is invariably related to qi.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As the Classic Text states: When food enters the stomach, it nourishes and flows with qi, which is then transmitted to the spleen. The spleen&#39;s qi disperses the essence, which ascends to the lungs, connecting to the waterways and descending to the bladder. The essence of water is distributed throughout, and the five channels operate in harmony with the four seasons and the five elements, balancing yin and yang, establishing what is considered normal. This means that the process moves from the stomach to the spleen, then to the lungs, and subsequently spreads through the channels. Thus, if there is a departure of blood, one should replenish qi; if blood is stagnant, one should regulate qi. Qi is governed by the lungs, which is clear in its meaning. These matters reflect the necessary distinctions in the channels. However, if one examines the subtle intricacies, there are still further distinctions to be made. Generally, the onset of disease may stem from thoughts and worries, emotional stress, excessive labor, or the six evils linked to diet, often arising in the four organs of the heart, lungs, liver, and spleen; in severe cases, the four organs are affected, eventually implicating the spleen and kidneys. When yang is depleted, food intake decreases, leading to exhaustion of the spleen and stomach qi. When yin is depleted, essence and blood diminish daily, causing a decline in kidney qi. Therefore, I say: When yang pathogens invade, harm must return to yin; when the five organs are harmed, the consequence must reach the kidneys. This flow and source is inevitable, and is key to treatment. Consequently, when treating channel disorders, if the condition is not too severe, one should first resolve the underlying cause; if it has already become critical, one must consider the root and firmly secure it; to the point where both the spleen and kidneys are severely harmed, sources are depleting daily, leading to pallor and exhaustion, which could culminate in complete cessation. Those who mistakenly advocate simply breaking through stagnant blood will invite disaster swiftly. It is essential to avoid cold and cool medicines at any stage of channel activity, as well as in diet.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Menstrual irregularities</p>
<p>The menstrual blood is the essence of food and grains, harmonized and regulated in the five organs, dispersed and expressed in the six bowels, and can thus enter the meridians. Its source comes unceasingly, transformed by the spleen, governed by the heart, stored in the liver, disseminated by the lungs, and released by the kidneys, to nourish the entire body. In men, it transforms into sperm; in women, it manifests above as breast milk, and below it returns to the blood sea to form menstrual cycles. As long as the essence and blood are intact, emotions are balanced, diet is appropriate, the Yang generates, and Yin grows, then the meridians will be full, and what irregularities could there be? If one does not know moderation, the harm of the seven emotions is severe, followed by fatigue; perhaps also due to reckless desires, where strength and weakness conflict, leading to disharmony in the Chong and Ren meridians, these instances are not uncommon. Furthermore, external influences and internal injuries, or errors in medicine, may harm the nutritive energy, but there are always causes for such. People who are weak and often ill, unable to endure cold or heat, or wearied by labor, may often be those born with inherent frailties; however, if Qi and blood are properly nurtured but excessive indulgence leads to deterioration, or if the essence and blood are insufficiently full and are prematurely depleted, harming the source of transformation and growth, they will suffer lifelong consequences. This is the precursor to illness that should be thoroughly investigated and adjusted. If one wishes to regulate an existing condition, then the vital principles of deficiency and excess, Yin and Yang, are essential.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Danxi said: Those who arrive early face a heat in the blood; those who arrive late face a deficiency in the blood. Wang Ziheng said: If Yang is excessive, it arrives early; if Yin is insufficient, it arrives late. Variations in quantity, interruptions, and continuous flow are all due to the fluctuations of Yin and Yang, a major consequence of imbalance. However, if it arrives early, although there may be heat, if it is deficient and accompanied by heat, the focus should be on nourishing the essence and calming the blood. Moreover, there can be cases of arriving early without heat, which may require either tonifying the middle Qi or strengthening the vital gate, but one should avoid excessive coldness. Those who arrive late primarily belong to blood deficiency. However, there are instances where heat causes dryness and stagnation, necessitating a clear supplementation; if the blood reverses and remains stagnant, one must promote its flow. In general, the method of regulating menstruation aims for harmony, primarily relying on detailed assessment of the pulse and symptoms. If both the form and the Qi are abundant, it is permissible to use clearing and promoting methods. However, the manifestations of deficiency are often prevalent, while those of excess are rare. Therefore, the key to regulating menstruation lies in nourishing the spleen and stomach to support the source of blood, and nurturing kidney Qi to stabilize the residence of blood; this dual approach is ideal. If the essence is fundamentally deficient and one is unaware of nurturing it, it will inevitably decline and exhaust; this cannot be overlooked.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Blood Colors</strong></p>
<p>In general, blood colors can be distinguished, and this naturally allows us to assess the presence or absence of conditions, and to identify cold and heat. If the blood is thick and abundant, this indicates robust blood; if the color is pale and scant, it signifies weak blood. This is a fundamental principle that is easy to understand. </p>
<p>Regarding the distinction between purple and black, the symptoms are as different as ice and charcoal, yet many people fail to comprehend this, leading to significant errors. Purple and black are closely related; nowadays, when people merely observe purple blood without distinguishing its true nature, they conclude it indicates severe internal heat. They fail to realize that bright red blood that is thick and forms patches or streaks is a sign of new blood in disorder, often resulting from internal heat. Conversely, blood that is purple and includes black, whether dispersed or thin, and that appears dark and stagnant, generally indicates a genuine depletion of vital energy and is likely associated with true cold. </p>
<p>If this condition worsens, it may resemble water leaking in a house or decaying old blood; these are all manifestations of purple-black changes. This reflects significant injury to the liver and spleen and a great decline of yang energy. In such cases, one should promptly use sweet warming remedies, such as Yin Jian, Li Zhong Tang, Gui Pi Tang, Si Wei Hui Yang Yin, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If one solely focuses on tonifying the spleen, the weakened will be lifted, the exhausted will be secured, and one’s original energy will gradually recover, leading to the resolution of illness. </p>
<p>If one exclusively attributes the purple color to a heat condition, death will undoubtedly follow with the use of medicine. This applies equally to cases of bloody stools and related issues. Scholars must pay particular attention to this.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blood Drought and Menstrual Closure</strong></p>
<p>Blood drought and blood blockage are fundamentally different. Blockage refers to an obstruction; drought refers to depletion. Obstruction occurs due to the stagnation of pathogenic qi, causing the blood to reverse. Depletion arises from the deficiency of the Chong and Ren channels, interrupting the flow of blood. Generally, when women suffer illness for a period of several months, they invariably experience menstrual closure. This is because the yin has become depleted, leading to blood drought, where there is simply no blood. </p>
<p>Thus, whether due to weakness, fatigue, coughing, blood heat, reduced appetite, loss of blood, or any conditions without swelling, pain, or obstruction, if menstruation does not arrive for a long time, it is undoubtedly a case of blood drought and closure. To prevent it from drying up, nourishing the nutrients is essential; to unblock it, supplementing is crucial. Just as when snow melts, spring water flows naturally; when blood is abundant, menstrual pathways reopen. </p>
<p>When the source is abundant, who can obstruct it? Yet, the present-day practitioners ignore whether there is stagnation or not, often resorting to dispelling remedies, and in severe cases, exclusively using substances like peach kernel and safflower to facilitate flow. Do they not realize that stagnant blood can be unblocked, but dried blood cannot be? If blood is already dried, trying to unblock it will only exacerbate the condition, akin to squeezing out the last drop from a dried fruit! This shows a lack of understanding of the meaning of &#39;drought.’ This can cause significant harm; one should not fall into this error. The treatment approach should be combined with the previous principles of blood deficiency and kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blood Heat and Early Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Blood heat often arrives prematurely and must be assessed for its yin energy&#39;s strength or weakness. If the complexion is mostly red, or dark purple and thick, or there is excessive loss, the pulse will be rapid and smooth, with the internal organs desiring cold and fearing heat; all of these indicate types of fire.</p>
<p>To treat blood heat with fire, one should primarily use cooling and transformative herbs. If the fire is very strong, such as with herbs that withdraw heat, they may be used temporarily. However, one must not confuse false fire as true fire, or treat deficient fire as if it were excessive fire.</p>
<p>Generally, when heat is present, it tends to flow well, but if there&#39;s consistent early menstruation, herbs such as Xu Duan (Dipsacus), Di Yu (Sanguisorba), Dan Shen (Salvia), Qian Cao (Madder Root), or Zhi Zi (Gardenia) can all be employed. If there is a slight fire and yin deficiency leading to early menstruation, the treatment should nourish yin and clear fire, using decoctions like Bao Yin Jian.</p>
<p>Early menstruation should be considered approximately each month. Blood heat should be evaluated through the condition of the entire body’s organs. One should not hastily declare early menstruation due to imbalance when there is merely light bleeding. Neither should one classify it as heat solely based on the early arrival without evidence of fire in the pulse or symptoms.</p>
<p>If there is no fire in the pulse or symptoms, but early menstruation occurs, it indicates deficiency of heart and spleen qi, which cannot stabilize and retain the essence. In this case, one should use Da Ying Jian (Major Nutrient Decoction), Da Bu Yuan Jian (Major Original Nourishing Decoction), or a Five Blessings Decoction with additions like Du Zhong (Eucommia) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra) for treatment. These situations are quite common, and treating them as fire will certainly lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>If menstruation comes two to three times within a month, or arrives in as little as half a month or ten days, this indicates a chaotic state of blood and qi. Treatment should be adjusted based on the balance of cold and heat, and should not be treated merely as early menstruation.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

<p>Those with blood heat often experience an early onset of menstruation. This occurs when the nutritive blood flows smoothly and is not severely depleted. If there is an internal yin fire eroding the blood, it may also lead to a delayed period due to the deficiency of water and the dryness of blood. The treatment should involve clearing heat and nourishing yin, using formulas like modified Si Wu Decoction, modified Yi Yin Decoction, or Eight Flavors Pill to nourish yin.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Cold with Delayed Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Generally, those with blood cold will have their menstruation arrive later. What causes blood to be cold? It results from insufficient yang qi, leading to cold rising from within and causing a failure to regularize. This is what is often referred to as cold. When yin cold enters from the outside or internal cold injures, it could lead to blood reversal or pain; this is a different condition related to stagnation and should not be confused with blood cold causing delayed menstruation, which requires careful differentiation. </p>
<p>For those with insufficient yang qi and blood cold leading to delayed menstruation, the blood may appear dull, sometimes dark or stagnant and scarce. The pulse may be weak, thin, or deep, and the vital energy of the organs may manifest as aversion to cold and preference for warmth. These symptoms indicate a lack of fire in the body, and the treatment should involve warming and nourishing the blood qi, using formulas like Da Ying Decoction or Li Yin Decoction. Generally, since cold leads to stagnation, ingredients like ginger, cassia, Wu Zhu Yu, or Baijiu should be added, and in severe cases, Aconite should be included.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

<p>Menstrual abdominal pain has both excess and deficiency conditions. The excess may be due to cold stagnation, blood stagnation, qi stagnation, or heat stagnation; the deficiency may arise from blood deficiency or qi deficiency. Generally, pain from excess often occurs before menstruation and lessens during menstruation. In contrast, pain from deficiency typically arises after menstruation has started, with pain persisting or even worsening as the blood is expelled. One can usually determine between excess and deficiency by palpation; pain that can be pressed and massaged is often deficient, while pain that resists pressure is generally excessive.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Entering the Blood Chamber</strong></p>
<p>When a woman suffers from typhoid fever or labor, or is affected by anger and heat, and then experiences her menstrual cycle, it can lead to heat entering the blood chamber. This may result in either unceasing bleeding or difficulty in blood circulation, causing her to be clear-headed and calm during the day, but to speak deliriously at night as if seeing ghosts. </p>
<p>If the heat comes from an external pathogen entering through the surface, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, or Three Chai Hu Decoction, or Four Chai Hu Decoction, or a well-known Huang Long Decoction adjusted with raw Rehmannia. </p>
<p>If the heat arises from internal factors such as anger or overexertion, and the person sweats a lot without exterior symptoms, it is better to use formulas like Bao Yin Decoction, Qing Hua Decoction, or Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction with adjustments. </p>
<p>If the condition is gradually improving but the vital energy is inherently weak and the heat has not yet subsided, and bleeding continues, one should consider using Bu Yin Yi Qi Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>If the spleen&#39;s energy is inherently weak, Gui Pi Decoction is advised; for those with both blood and energy deficiencies, Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction would be appropriate, so as not to make mistakes. </p>
<p>If there is much stagnant heat in the blood, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with additions of Dan Pi, Hong Hua, and Dang Gui.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discussion states: When Yangming syndrome presents with bloody stools and aberrant speech, this is due to heat entering the blood chamber, applicable to both men and women. It mentions that if a woman experiences a stroke and then, after seven or eight days, has a recurrence of cold and heat with intermittent symptoms, accompanied by a disruption in menstrual flow, this is heat entering the blood chamber, leading to blood stagnation, which can present like a febrile disease with recurrent symptoms. Minor Chaihu Decoction is indicated for this condition. </p>
<p>If a woman suffers from a stroke, with a slow pulse and cool body, showing symptoms of chest blockage, she should undergo puncturing at the Qimen point. If a woman with cold-induced illness has her menstrual flow arrive at the right time, feels clear during the day but exhibits aberrant speech in the evening, she must not disturb the stomach qi or the upper two jiaos, and she will surely recover on her own. </p>
<p>The blood chamber refers to the Chong and Ren vessels, and also pertains to the blood division. In general, ailments of the blood division involve blood stagnation resulting from heat causing retention, or heat entering the blood chamber leading to chaotic blood flow. Thus, if the blood is stagnant, its removal will lead to recovery; if the blood is chaotic, its regulation will provide peace. </p>
<p>The methods for regulation are such that overheating conditions should receive cooling treatment, sinking conditions should be raised, deficient conditions should be nourished, and stagnant conditions should be moved. If the pathogenic factor has not dispersed, it should be resolved. However, all these ailments reside in the lower jiao, hence it is said not to disturb the stomach qi or the upper two jiaos; only then will recovery be assured. This must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: If a woman experiences itching in the prohibited areas, abdominal heat and pain, issues with milk secretion, improper conditions in the vaginal area, coldness and pain in the lower abdomen, and menstrual cessation, the Central Extreme point governs these conditions. If a woman&#39;s blood is not flowing, the perineum point governs her situation. If menstrual flow is obstructed, leading to distension and pain in the waist and spine, the Qi point is responsible. If there is pain within the uterus and menstrual flow does not cease at the appropriate time, the Heavenly Pivot point governs this condition. If there is distension and fullness in the lower abdomen, with pain radiating inward, resulting in pain in the waist and spine during menstruation, and if there are masses in the uterus, along with cold sensations in the vaginal area causing patellar pain, the Water Path point is responsible. If a woman experiences poor menstrual flow or sudden obstruction, with symptoms of abdominal distension, heat in the body, and cramping pain in the abdomen, along with hernias and swelling in the genital region, the Qi is pushed upwards and needs to be released. If a woman has pain and hardness in the lower abdomen along with obstructed menstrual flow, the Belt Vessel governs this issue. If there is leakage below, and if menstrual blood does not flow properly, causing counteracting Qi and distension, the Sea of Blood point is responsible. If blood is obstructed, leading to infertility and lack of appetite, the Curved Spring point governs this condition.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>In the &quot;Records of the Historian,&quot; it is said in the biography of Cang Gong: The maid of King Jibei, Han Nü, suffered from pain in her waist and back, along with chills and fevers. All the doctors believed it to be due to chills and fevers. However, in my opinion, upon examining her pulse, I found internal coldness, and that her menstrual flow had not occurred. Thus, I treated her with medicine, and soon after, her condition improved. The root of her illness was her desire for a male offspring which she could not obtain. Therefore, I discerned the nature of Han Nü&#39;s ailment by examining her pulse and found it weak and unsteady at the kidney pulse. The weak and unsteady pulse indicates that it is difficult to establish a regular pattern, thus the menstrual flow has not come. The liver pulse was tense at the left side, indicating her desire for a son was unattainable. It is because men are primarily associated with essence, while women are primarily associated with blood. When a man&#39;s essence is abundant, he thinks of establishing a household; when a woman&#39;s blood is plentiful, she is capable of conceiving. The liver is responsible for regulating blood. The Jueyin pulse is tense at the wrist and extends to the thenar eminence, indicating that the yin blood is abundant.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yuan History&quot; states: Pei Ze’s wife suffered from chills and fevers, her menstrual cycle was absent for several years, and she developed a cough. The doctors generally prescribed medicines containing gecko, cinnamon, and aconite. Li Gao disagreed, saying: It is a case where the yang attacks the yin, and excessive warming agents are ineffective and even harmful; using cold-blooded medicines will restore her menstrual flow. Eventually, this proved to be true.</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Door to Filial Piety&quot; mentions a woman whose menstruation was absent, experiencing alternating chills and fevers, dry mouth, red cheeks, a thirst for drink, and a cough once or twice during the day and night. All doctors diagnosed her as having stagnant menstrual blood and prescribed the likes of gall insects, leeches, lacquer, pounded stone, wild rue, and myrrh. Only Dai Ren disagreed, stating: Although ancient prescriptions include these remedies, patients who take them are bound to experience abdominal pain and loss of appetite. He then ordered to stop the medicines and gradually allowed food intake.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When both forms of yang disease affect the heart and spleen, if the heart is afflicted, the blood does not flow, hence the woman’s menstruation is absent. Once the heart accumulates heat, one should reduce fire and promote water to flow, moistening dryness and stimulating appetite, which will then cause the discharge of one or two liters of phlegm and several flows of water. Humidity will dissipate, allowing blood and qi to move freely, leading to the restoration of menstruation on schedule without being obstructed by dampness.</p>
<p>There is no need to use toxic substances like gall insects or leeches; if used, even if menstruation returns, small urination may be hindered, and other symptoms will arise. Whenever there is a deficiency of vital blood, it should be replenished through diet, and one must avoid toxic medicines that could lead to fatal consequences.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, thirty-four years old, had irregular menstruation, alternating cold and heat, a pale yellow complexion, with dry lips and a flushed face. She occasionally coughed a few times. The medications she had previously taken included Black God Powder, Black Gold Pill, Siwu Decoction, Liver Burn Powder, Turtle Shell Powder, Jianzhong Decoction, and Ningfei Powder, along with hundreds of acupuncture sessions, but her condition worsened. Her family, feeling weary, did not wish to seek further treatment. A compassionate individual intervened, first draining five or six liters of phlegm. By noon, the draining was complete, and in the afternoon she began to eat, with all other symptoms eliminated. Three days later, phlegm was lightly drained again, and one or two liters were removed, after which her appetite improved. In a few days, she was given a menstrual regulation powder, which resulted in the expulsion of one or two liters. In the following days, a significant amount of dead skin was shed, some pieces as small as bran flakes and others as large as reed membranes. Within a month, her menstruation resumed, and her spirit was greatly improved.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman in her twenties suffered from amenorrhea, alternating chills and fever, and coughing with tidal fever. Mediocre doctors forbade her from eating anything, leaving her with nothing to consume. One day, as summer approached, she went out and unexpectedly saw a seller of cold jelly. She mixed it with ice water and consumed a large quantity, immediately feeling refreshed and invigorated. After several months, her menstruation resumed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A woman with prolonged malaria experienced little food and amenorrhea. Her pulse was weak, and every day she took over ten pills of Sanhua Shenyou pills, swallowing them with saliva. After a month, her appetite and pulse improved; after another half month, she fully recovered, and after one more month, her menstruation returned.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; mentions: A woman aged thirty always experienced a cold water shower after bathing. After a great shock, she suffered severe lower abdominal pain before her menstruation, followed by excessive salivation, and only then did her menstruation come. Afterward, she would vomit for two days, and the pain lasted until the seventh or sixth day when her menstruation ceased, and no medicines had any effect. I examined her pulse; it was slippery and large at the cun position but taut; the guan and chi positions were both taut, large, and rapid, with the chi smaller than the guan, and the guan smaller than the cun, which indicates the front is larger than the back. I then prescribed three liang of Xiangfu, two liang of Banxia, one and a half liang each of Fuling and Huangqin, one liang each of Zhishi, Yanhusuo, Danpi, Ren Shen, Dang Gui, Bai Zhu, and Tao Ren, seven qian of Huanglian, and half a liang each of Chuanlian, Yuan Zhi, and Gancao, with three qian of Guo and one and a half qian of Zhuyou. This was divided into fifteen doses, boiled in water, combined with two shreds of fresh ginger juice, and taken hot. Afterwards, she was to bathe with hot soup until slightly sweating, then stop.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

After applying thirty medicinal patches, a full recovery was achieved. Six months later, due to anxiety and worry, the previous illness relapsed, causing pain in the lower back and abdomen, painful urination, and a feeling of palpitations and anxiety. I believed the surface symptoms had resolved but the underlying issue remained. First, I applied moxibustion to the points Shaochong, Laogong, Kunlun, and Sanyinjiao to stop the palpitations and ease the pain. Next, I used Tao Ren (peach kernel) to induce a strong downward movement. After the treatment, I used three taels of Xiangfu, one and a half taels each of Poria and Angelica, and one tael each of Sanleng, Yanhusuo, Cinnamon, Rhubarb, and Qingpi, all prepared with vinegar. Additionally, one tael each of Qingmuxiang, Fennel, Talcum, and Mutong, along with one tael of Tao Ren, half a tael each of Wuyao, Ganjiang, Sand ginger, Betel nut, and Bitter neem, and two qian (drachms) each of Muxiang and Wuzhuyu were divided into twenty patches.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: A young woman experienced swelling below her ear, suffered from frequent heat and dry mouth, and had her menstrual flow come late and in small amounts. An elderly woman, thinking it was due to menstrual closure, used leeches to treat it, which led to her becoming weaker and eventually dying. The menstrual flow is governed by the hand Taiyang and hand Shaoyin meridians, which are interrelated; one governs milk and the other governs menstrual flow, as they are the residual energy of the meridians. If there is no invasion of the six excesses from the outside, and no injury from the seven emotions on the inside, and if the spleen and stomach&#39;s energy is strong, then the Chong and Ren vessels will be abundant, causing the menstrual flow to arrive at the proper time. However, with a pale yellow complexion, emaciated limbs, heat and dry mouth, and menstruation that is overdue and scant, there is a deficiency of yin and blood. This is not due to an excess of blood stasis but rather indicates the need for nourishing blood and energy. Gradually nurturing it will ensure the menstrual energy becomes robust and the flow arrives on time.</p>
<p>There was a woman whose menstrual cycle was overdue, and she experienced fever and fatigue. She used formulas such as Si Wu and Huang Lian, but after two months, the flow was still scant and clotty; moreover, using harsh drugs to expedite it caused her eyes to appear as if covered by silk. I diagnosed that the spleen is the chief of all yin, and the eyes are the root of the blood vessels. If the spleen is damaged, all the organs will lose their proper function and cannot return to the eyes. Thus, I used the formulas Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Ji Sheng Gui Pi, focusing on strengthening the spleen and stomach. After a year, she recovered.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had fever and dry mouth, with irregular menstruation and weak legs; after using a remedy to dispel wind and eliminate dampness, she experienced leg pain and fatigue, with swollen knees and obstruction of menstruation. I diagnosed her with deficiency in the blood of the three yin meridians and excessive heat, naming it &quot;Crane Knee Wind.&quot; After taking the Six-Flavor and Eight-Flavor pills for two months, her body gradually grew stronger, appetite increased, knee swelling decreased, and she was fully healed after half a year.</p>
<p>Another woman had her period arrive prematurely, experiencing fever and sweating. After using a remedy to clear heat and stop sweating, she suffered from thirst, dizziness, and numbness in her hands and body. I said: This is caused by blood deficiency in the liver meridian, leading to fiery movement; the excess of yang generates wind. I prescribed equal parts of Chai Hu, fried Huang Qin, Lian, Shan Zhi, Gui, Shao Yao, Sheng Di, and Dan Pi, along with Ren Shen, Qi, Ling, and Shu each at 1.5 qian, and 7 fen of Chuan Xiong, and 5 fen of Gan Cao. After two doses, the sweating stopped; I then used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, while menstruating and engaging in labor, suddenly fainted, her face reddened and she vomited phlegm. I determined that this was due to excessive loss of blood, leaving no source for yang. Quickly, I administered about a bowl of child&#39;s urine, and her mind gradually became clearer. I then prescribed 5 qian each of Ren Shen and Qi, 3 qian each of Xiong and Gui, and 1 qian each of Yuan Shen, Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and roasted Gan Cao in one dose. Additionally, I used Xiao Yao San with an extra two doses of Wu Wei and Mai Men Dong, and after a month, she gradually improved. However, she still felt fatigued and had a yellowish face, so I treated her with Shi Quan Da Bu Tang combined with Wu Wei and Mai Dong, and she recovered.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had long suffered from hardship. At the beginning of winter, she developed a cough and fever. After a long time, she coughed up blood and experienced night sweats. Her menstrual cycle was irregular, occurring every two or three months, accompanied by general body pain. She used phlegm-relieving and fire-subduing medicines, but her mouth was dry and her limbs were spasming. This indicated blood deficiency, and the medication was causing harm instead of benefit. I administered a modified version of the Bawei pill and tonic herbs to boost her energy, adding wheat sheath, five-flavor fruit, and yam to treat her condition. She recovered after a year.</p>
<p>Another woman had a melancholic disposition and worried excessively. Her menstruation was absent, her chest felt full, and her appetite was poor. She experienced bloating and sour regurgitation. I believed this to be due to deficiency and cold in the central qi, so I used the tonic to strengthen the center and approved the addition of cardamom, cyperus, and roasted ginger in two doses to soothe her chest and promote appetite. I further provided six gentlemen&#39;s decoction with added chuanxiong, angelica, fritillaria, platycodon, fresh ginger, and jujube in several doses to strengthen her spleen and stomach, and her menstruation eventually normalized.</p>
<p>A woman had long suffered from stomach heat and found relief with a胃清 powder but later, due to overexertion, experienced irritability, thirst, and internal heat, which led to weight loss and absent menstruation. I posited that this was due to stomach heat consuming the yin and blood. I prescribed Xiaoyao powder, adding peony and stir-fried gardenia to clear stomach heat, and used Eight Treasures Decoction with ingredients like poria and polygala to nourish spleen blood. Eventually, her menstruation resumed.</p>
<p>A woman had long suffered from malaria, feeling weak and experiencing afternoon fevers, spontaneous sweating, and night sweats. Her appetite was poor and her thoughts were troubled, causing her menstruation to stop. I believed that the deficiency led to the malaria, which in turn caused her amenorrhea.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had seven pregnancies, her menstrual cycle was irregular, her legs were warm, and for over a year, she felt heat throughout her body, and her feet ached when fatigued. After another year, her lips swelled, cracked, and hurt; after another six months, her lips split and bled, her body became thin and fatigued, her appetite diminished, her menstrual flow ceased, and the area beneath her lips swelled like black dates, sometimes resulting in death from taking medicines like menstrual regulating pills.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Qian Sixi had no descendants after more than thirty years. His wife&#39;s menstrual flow was intermittent, and they had lived apart for several years. Qian Sixi wished to take a concubine to seek heirs. I believed this was due to anger and sorrow harming the liver and spleen, causing empty heat leading to blood not returning to the menstrual cycle, thus the liver could not store and the spleen could not hold. I decided to clear liver heat and tonify spleen qi, so I provided him with a modified Gui Pi and Xiao Yao formula in four doses, which I sent to his home, advising his mother-in-law that taking this would cure her condition and she could conceive without needing to marry another wife. Indeed, the ailment was resolved, and the following year, he had a child.</p>
<p>A woman was naturally impatient; whenever she was angry, her temples, throat, teeth, chest, and breasts would ache. This caused fullness in her chest, sour belching, and she would have little appetite and continuous menstrual flow. These were all signs of liver fire. When the liver was in disorder, external signs appeared; when the earth was overwhelmed, internal signs emerged. I first used Si Wu Decoction with Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Chai Hu, Stir-fried Zhi Zi, and Stir-fried Long Dan to clear the liver and nourish blood, then I applied Si Jun Zi Tang with Chai Hu, Shao Yao, Shen Qu, Wu Zhu Yu, and Stir-fried Huang Lian to strengthen the earth and control the liver, gradually improving her condition. However, the menstruation was still ongoing, indicating that the blood had heat and the spleen qi was still deficient, so I used Xiao Yao San with increased Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, and Chen Pi, and also incorporated Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with wine-fried Shao Yao for concurrent use to stabilize her condition.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman experienced excessive anger, and her menstrual period lasted over ten days. After that, she had irregular bleeding without any end, felt weary and emaciated, had a dry mouth and internal heat, night sweats profuse as if washed, and very pronounced heat during the day. All these symptoms were due to depletion of liver and spleen, leading to an inability to generate original qi. The treatment included ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, poria, distant wisdom, jujube seeds, wheat husk, five-flavor fruit, moutan root, longan flesh, honey-fried licorice, bupleurum, and elevation of hemp, and she recovered. This condition initially arose from anger stirring the liver fire, causing the blood to run rampant. Later, it resulted in the spleen qi sinking, unable to contain blood and return it to its source, hence the use of the aforementioned medicines. If there is stasis due to heat in the stomach causing cessation of menstruation, one should clear the stomach. If there is excessive heart fire, one should clear the heart. If too many drying medicines have been taken, one should nourish the blood. If the illness has been long and qi and blood are deficient, one should tonify the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Another woman, feeling unsatisfied in her embrace, had abdominal distension with little sleep, a sparse diet, phlegm surging upwards, and frequent menstruation. I said, &quot;The spleen governs blood and controls phlegm. This depression harms the spleen, which cannot contain the blood and return it to its source.&quot; The treatment was to tonify qi and blood, and to use the formula to nourish the spleen, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old girl had a long-standing pox that would not heal, had not yet experienced menarche, was feverish and coughing, ate little, and wished to use a menstrual-regulating pill. I said, &quot;This is likely due to insufficient inherited qi, leading to a lack of yin blood. One should nourish qi and blood, and replenish fluids, allowing the menstruation to resume on its own.&quot; She was confused by the desire for quick effects and continued with her choice. I said, &quot;This is not the appropriate treatment.&quot; This is a vehement medicine that greatly boosts yang fire, leading to errant movement of yin blood; if the spleen and stomach get this, they become even more deficient. Eventually, she experienced erratic menstruation, ate even less, and consequently faced dire consequences.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a></p></div>

The remedy is to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Fang Feng, Shao Yao, and fried Huang Bai, while alternating with Gui Pi Decoction to regulate the source of transformation, allowing the blood to return to the channels.</p>
<p>A woman experiences abdominal pain during her menstruation, vomits when she eats, feels bodily fatigue, and has heat and thirst. This is a result of hereditary deficiency in qi and blood. After using Ba Zhen Decoction for more than twenty doses, she recovers. Two years after giving birth, her menstruation stops again, and previous symptoms recur. After taking Ba Zhen Decoction and Xiao Yao San for over a hundred doses, she recovers.</p>
<p>A woman aged fifty experiences internal heat, with evening fevers, and her menstruation occurs every two to three months. This is blood deficiency with heat, treated with Xiao Yao San and added Shan Zhu Yu, resulting in recovery. Later, she has phlegm-related thirst, irregular urination, or white discharge with a headache, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for stabilization.</p>
<p>A woman suffers from evening heat. She is thin and fatigued, has little appetite and no taste, and her menstruation is absent, along with episodes of nosebleeds and excessive menstrual bleeding for half a year. She tried remedies like Shun Qi Yin to clear heat and stop bleeding, but did not respond; instead, her chills and fever worsened, and she occasionally felt nausea. I believe it is due to anger damaging the spleen and stomach and false activity of deficient fire in the channels. So, I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction in the morning, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan in the evening for several doses, leading to recovery in half a year.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, inherently quiet in nature, experienced internal heat and irregular menstrual cycles. Every one or two months, she suffered bleeding from the gums, under the tongue, or in the throat for about a year. After taking cooling and blood-regulating medicines, she asked me for treatment. I diagnosed it as liver and spleen qi stagnation leading to upward-moving blood heat. I first prescribed a modified Gui Pi Decoction, followed by a modified Xiao Yao San, to restore the blood and regulate her menstruation, and her symptoms improved rapidly.</p>
<p>A young woman had been suffering from chills and fever with irregular menstruation for a long time. I first treated her with Xiao Chai Hu Tang plus Sheng Di, which led to slight improvement. Then, taking Sheng Di Huang Wan, she fully recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, due to anger, experienced chills, fever, headaches, and incoherent speech that worsened at night, followed by a sudden onset of menstruation. This was caused by liver fire due to anger. I treated her with a modified Xiao Yao San plus Sheng Di Huang, and her mind became clear. However, she still had a poor appetite and was fatigued, with menstruation ongoing, indicating the spleen&#39;s role in holding blood was weak. I administered Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and she recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A woman, small and thin, around twenty years old, had dark purple menstrual blood that was irregular, experiencing abdominal pain before and during menstruation, with a dislike for cold yet craving warmth. Sometimes she would have chills, and her abdomen would hurt again, with a pulse that was thin, moist, and slightly slippery, with a heavy yet slightly full feeling on the pulse. This indicated blood heat. When asked how this cold could signify heat, I explained that extreme heat can resemble cold. I then used four taels of Huang Lian cooked in wine, two taels of Xiang Fu and Gui Shen Wei each, and one tael of Wu Ling Zhi, ground into a powder and made into pills to be taken on an empty stomach, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, twenty-one years old, experienced abdominal pain like cutting during her menstruation in June, unbearable to the point of seeking death. Her pulse was fine and soft yet rapid, while the pulse at her wrist was weak and heavy, close to being rapid. Wang said: &quot;A fine and soft pulse indicates dampness; if rapid, it suggests heat. A heavy pulse at the wrist signifies obstruction.&quot; </p>
<p>He prescribed half a pound of yellow aconite boiled in wine, six ounces of fried fragrant attach, three ounces of half-fried and half-raw five-spirit resin, and two ounces of tailbone cordial, ground into powder to make pills. Take three to four qian with warm water on an empty stomach, to be taken five to six doses. After nine years, she had a son. </p>
<p>Four years later, her menstruation continued for two months without interruption, accompanied by slight abdominal pain, and she took the previous pills again to recover. Afterward, her menstruation lasted six to seven days, and once it stopped, she had a clear water discharge with mild abdominal pain, again cured by the previous pills. </p>
<p>Again, her menstruation lasted only seven to eight days. At times during her period, it might last five to six days, then it would intermittently return, either slightly red or light red. After her period, she often had a clear water discharge, with severe pain in the lower abdomen that gradually spread throughout her body. Her chest, back, lower back, and bones in her legs also hurt, and the pain lasted from the time of the rabbit (from noon to 1 PM) to the time of the rooster (from 5 PM to 7 PM). The pain caused a profuse sweating, which, when reduced, alleviated the pain, allowing her to eat and drink. The pain had persisted from the beginning until now for a total of fifteen years.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Why does the previous medication work repeatedly but now show no effect? Wang re-examined the patient and found the pulse to be flood and slippery, yet thankfully the patient still had some spirit. Wang said, &quot;This is not like before; it was once stagnant heat, but now it is vacuous cold.&quot; Dongyuan stated, &quot;It began as heat within, and now has turned to cold within.&quot; This is indeed the case. The classic text states: &quot;When the pulse reaches but does not surge upon pressure, it indicates excess yin obstructing yang, and treatment should be cold.&quot; Moreover, the patient’s physique was previously small and now is robust. Medical texts say, &quot;Thin people have hot blood, while overweight individuals have deficient qi.” Can they be treated the same way? What we should be wary of is that large sweating can occur without the pulse weakening, and massive bleeding without the pulse diminishing. The pain is more intense during the day and less so at night, as if due to yang deficiency unable to support movement, thus causing stagnation and pain. Given the symptoms observed in the pulse, it is advisable to use methods to assist yang. If the pulse weakens and the pain lessens, it indicates a favorable sign. Subsequently, a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria was prescribed, akin to cinnamon and aconite added in a single dose. After a follow-up examination the next morning, the symptoms and pulse were somewhat stabilized. After taking two to thirty doses, between February and May, the illness began to heal. The illness has differences in the beginnings and endings of heat and cold, while the medications vary in their application and withdrawal; physical conditions of robustness, thinness, and youth also differ. How can one method be universally applied to treat them all?<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wu Jiaoshan treated a woman with excessive menstrual bleeding, feelings of heat in the five palms, and afternoon tidal fever. None of the medicines were effective, but after adding Hu Huanglian to the Four Substances decoction for three doses, she was cured.</p>
<p>Wang Shishan treated a woman whose menstrual cycle was marked by a requirement to have diarrhea for three days before the flow would begin. Upon examining her pulse, it was found to be weak and moist, indicating a deficiency of the spleen. The spleen relates to blood and dampness. When menstruation is about to occur, the blood from the spleen first flows into the blood sea before descending as menstrual flow. If the spleen’s blood is already deficient, it cannot manage the dampness, leading to this situation. He prescribed Shen Ling Bai Zhu powder, to be taken at two qian each time, and directed her to drink rice water two to three times a day. After a month, her menstruation did not cause diarrhea anymore.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman over forty years old, tall and slender in appearance, has had irregular menstruation and health issues. Her right pulse is superficial, soft, and large, while her left pulse is weak, soft, and small, close to a racing pulse. She often experiences diarrhea before her menstrual period. In April of this year, she caught a cold and coughed, used soup for bathing, sweated a lot, and then had diarrhea for a month. In June, after another bathing, she suffered from intermittent fever six or seven times. Although the fever stopped, her spirit remained unsettled. By August, her menstrual flow was excessive, accompanied by a white discharge. She experienced diarrhea and then noticed pain in her right foot. She had previously strained her heel, and now the pain had extended to her hip, leg, waist, side, buttocks, neck, and the right side of her body, all causing sharp pain. Whenever she coughed, her lower back felt as if pierced. The pain was lighter during the day but heavier at night, leading her to cry out incessantly. Fortunately, the pain eased somewhat, and her appetite remained normal. </p>
<p>Now, with the excessive menstrual flow and white discharge, light during the day and heavy at night, and the constant diarrhea, it is evident that there is excessive loss of yin, indicating a condition of blood deficiency. A formula of four herbs to stop the pain is very beneficial. In September, Wang re-examined her and realized that her condition matched what Zhongjing described as the principle that when yang is strong, yin becomes long. The excessive menstrual flow, white discharge, and constant diarrhea are all due to yang deficiency leading to downward descent, termed yang collapse. </p>
<p>During the day, when yang is flourishing, it fulfills its role, thus preventing blood stagnation, making it feel lighter. At night, with yin flourishing, yang loses its function and fails to operate normally, causing blood to stagnate and feeling heavier. Therefore, a mixture of ginseng and atractylodes to support yang was prescribed, and after taking five to seven doses, the pain decreased. This represents a change in the illness, and the treatment method is distinct, hence it is recorded.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>
