<p>Rear Yin Gate [Buttocks Attached]</p>
<p>Huangdi&#39;s Plain Questions</p>
<p>Discussion on the Correspondences of Yin and Yang<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Clear Yang emerges from the upper orifice, and Turbid Yin emerges from the lower orifice. </p>
<p>(Note: The Clear Yang of a person originates from Heaven and exits through the upper orifice. The Turbid Yin of a person originates from Earth and exits through the lower orifice. The Yin and Yang of a person are analogous to the rising of clouds and the falling of rain, connecting the energies of Heaven and Earth.) </p>
<p>The Yin flavor emerges from the lower orifice, while the Yang energy emerges from the upper orifice. </p>
<p>(Note: Flavor has substance, thus it flows downwards through the portal of excretion. Energy is formless, hence it emerges from the portal of respiration.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The Gate of the Spirit (Po Men) also functions for the five organs, and water and grains cannot be stored for long.</p>
<p>(Note: The Gate of the Spirit refers to the anus. It correlates with the lungs above, thus it is named the Gate of the Spirit. The impurities of the five organs exit from here, making it a lower orifice of the five organs. The filth of the intestines and stomach is expelled from here, hence it is said that water and grains cannot be stored for long.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Vital Energy Connecting to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Yang energy, when pure, nourishes the spirit; when gentle, nourishes the sinews. If the opening and closing are not regulated, cold energy enters, leading to severe hunching. A sunken pulse indicates a fistula, lingering within the flesh. </p>
<p>(Note: Yang energy nourishes the spirit of the five organs internally and promotes the development of tendons and bones externally, having both opening and closing dynamics, both ingress and egress. If the mechanism of opening and closing is lost, cold energy penetrates and diminishes internally. The back represents Yang; if Yang is deficient, cold evils obstruct the back, causing the body to hunch. If Yang is insufficient to uphold the nourishment of blood, the evils sink into the pulse, forming a fistula and lingering between the layers of flesh.) </p>
<p>Thus, excessive eating leads to sinews and pulses becoming slack, while the intestines and rectum are plagued by hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>When the yang energy is depleted, it cannot solidify the yin, leading to damage to the essence and blood. If one indulges in overeating and excessive strength, this condition manifests. The liver stores blood and governs the tendons, while the food energy enters the stomach, spreading the essence to the liver and the intoxicating energy to the tendons. If the liver is harmed, and one continues to overeat, the food energy cannot disperse, causing the sinews and vessels to become obstructed below. When the food energy stagnates, damp-heat accumulates in the yangming large intestine, resulting in hemorrhoids. The intestines and stomach are interconnected; food that enters the stomach cannot ascend and thus flows back down.</p>
<p>As for the strengthening influence of the yang, it solidifies and approaches, not being timely water ice; the transformation into feathers follows. Hemorrhoids and dysentery develop; cold and constriction enter the stomach, leading to internal heart pains. Inside, there are abscesses; hidden curves are unfavorable, mutually attracting the yin aspects. </p>
<p>The cold water energy of the greater yang prevails, which is why it solidifies and approaches. The &quot;not timely water ice&quot; reflects that this influence existed more than half a year ago, which is why the moths transform later. If the condition relates to the channel of the greater yang, it pertains to those suffering from hemorrhoids and dysentery caused by the cold and hot evils of the greater yang. Constriction entering the stomach is indicative of water overcoming earth. The stomach channels ascend to the heart, hence the heart pain. The presence of abscesses signifies hidden curves being unfavorable, mutually attracting the yin aspects. In the lesser yin&#39;s return, there are rashes, ulcers, carbuncles, boils, and hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><em>Note: The &quot;reversal&quot; refers to a condition where stagnation leads to resurgence. Heat injures Qi and blood, resulting in these various ailments.</em><br><em>— The Spiritual Pivot</em></p>
<p><em>Chapter on the Forms of Disease in Internal Organs</em></p>
<p><em>The kidney pulse is weak and deep, indicating a sluggish condition.</em><br><em>— Note: This is due to Qi and blood not circulating effectively.</em></p>
<p><em>Chapter on Abscesses</em></p>
<p><em>Abscesses that arise in the buttocks are called acute abscesses; they appear red, firm, and large, and must be treated urgently. If untreated, death can occur in thirty days.</em><br><em>— Note: The buttocks are a part of the greater yang (Taiyang), above which the cold water rule applies, thus a corresponding death may occur. The kidney represents yin and governs the bones, so pus accumulates in the bones without outward manifestation. The organs represent yang, and the Qi of Taiyang governs the skin&#39;s surface, hence the abscess appears red, firm, and large. Yang toxins originating externally can also lead to death, as Taiyang governs all yang forms of Qi.</em><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examination of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The anus weighs twelve taels, measures eight inches in circumference, approximately two and a half inches in diameter, and is twenty-eight inches long, receiving nine sheng and three he of grain, equating to one eighth of a he.<br><strong>Qian Jin Fang</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Between Obstruction and Openness</strong></p>
<p>The anus governs the large passageway, corresponding to the lungs and the large intestine, and is referred to as the official of passage. It weighs twelve taels, measures twelve inches in length, and two inches and two fen in width, corresponding to twelve times in a day. If the organs are injured by heat, the anus will become blocked, and the passage will be obstructed, or it may swell and ulcerate. If the organs are injured by cold, the anus will open, leading to diarrhea, protrusion, and will take a long time to retract. Heat should be treated with expulsion, while cold requires reinforcement. The anus controls the lungs; if the lung heats correspond to the anus, it causes blockage, unsuitable passage and swelling, leading to ulcerations. </p>
<p>For treatment, combine three sheng of honey and boil until dry. Then, mix it with cold water to form pills, six to seven inches in length, to be inserted into the anus, with the body turned upside down and the head downwards. After a while, remove them; this will lead to immediate passage and relief.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Hidden Lower Worm</strong> </p>
<p>When one suffers from typhoid or febrile diseases and experiences internal heat, accompanied by a reduced appetite and emptiness in the intestines and stomach, three worms begin to seek food and consume the five viscera and lower parts of the body. If the gums have no color, the tongue is completely white, and in severe cases, there are sores inside the lips, the limbs feel heavy, and there is a tendency to sleep excessively. One should examine the inside of the upper lip for sores, spitting blood; if the inside of the lips resembles millet sores, then the heart is restless and painful, indicating that the worm in the upper part is consuming the five viscera. If there are sores inside the lower lip and the person enjoys sleeping, then the worm in the lower part is consuming the lower region. If one is not aware, they can take this worm-eradicating medicine. Otherwise, the hidden lower worm will be lethal.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that those afflicted with the moist hidden lower worm are often those who have suffered from heat-related illnesses or have persistent chronic diarrhea, or have some external heat lodged in the abdomen, or have been affected by warm, humid conditions. Such conditions can easily lead to this disease. There can also be cases of dry hidden lower worms that do not manifest as severe diarrhea but cause itching in the lower parts. Regardless of whether it is dry or moist, if it persists, it can be fatal. </p>
<p>For those with moist conditions who feel cold with symptoms like diarrhea, boiling herbs such as Coptis chinensis, mugwort leaves, or bitter herb can be used. If the patient has colorless gums, a white tongue, or feels drowsy and irritable without recognizing the areas of pain or itchiness, or has diarrhea, it is crucial to treat the lower parts urgently. Those who are unaware may only treat the upper parts and neglect the lower. If there are worms in the lower region, they will consume the anus, leading to decay, revealing the five viscera, and ultimately resulting in death. Burning mugwort in a bamboo tube and using the smoke for treatment is advised. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Hemorrhoids</strong><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>There are five types of hemorrhoids: the first is male hemorrhoid, the second is female hemorrhoid, the third is pulse hemorrhoid, the fourth is intestinal hemorrhoid, and the fifth is blood hemorrhoid. The male hemorrhoid appears at the anus like a mouse&#39;s milk, frequently discharging pus and blood. The female hemorrhoid causes swelling and pain, leading to sores. The pulse hemorrhoid has sores at the anus accompanied by itching and pain. The intestinal hemorrhoid causes painful lumps at the anus with cold and heat sensations. The blood hemorrhoid involves defecating clear blood, which stains the stool.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are five more hemorrhoids: the gas hemorrhoid, which arises from cold, warmth, labor, and dampness; it is associated with snake shedding its skin. The male hemorrhoid grows fleshy like mouse&#39;s milk and protrudes from the opening, causing issues when changing clothes, and is treated with tortoise shell. The female hemorrhoid grows outward from the opening, ulcerating and discharging pus and blood after five or six days; it is treated with hedgehog skin. The intestinal hemorrhoid protrudes during changing clothes and takes time to retreat; it is treated with the suspended hoof of a mother pig. The pulse hemorrhoid produces clear blood during changing clothes and is treated with beehives.</p>
<p>Each of these five types should be divided into equal parts, with the primary medicine doubled to three parts, taken in the morning with a spoonful of well water. For severe cases, it can be taken morning and evening or four to five doses. Avoid cold, raw pig meat, freshwater fish, vegetables, and sexual relations. Only consume dry white meat. After the hemorrhoids heal, sexual relations should be avoided for a hundred days. There are also medicines that guide treatment to the lower part, for internal sores, and inside the openings for those without sores. Additionally, there is wild kudzu powder, knives and chisels, mixed with internal medicine; take for five days to know the results, typically healing in twenty days and completely recovering in thirty. Hemorrhoid pain should avoid consuming water shield.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>There are five types of hemorrhoids: male hemorrhoids, female hemorrhoids, intestinal hemorrhoids, pulse hemorrhoids, and blood hemorrhoids. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Indulging in excessive food leads to the obstruction of the meridians and results in hemorrhoids. Disorders of the organs mainly arise from irregular eating habits, excessive drinking at inappropriate times, indulging in rich and fatty foods, consuming spicy peppers, strong wines, and a variety of meats, being overly indulgent and drunk, indulging in pleasures without moderation, exposure to severe cold or heat, prolonged sitting in damp places, excessively engaging in visual stimuli, and holding in bowel movements for extended periods. These habits cause an imbalance of yin and yang, leading to blockages and the influx of wind and heat, resulting in the emergence of the five types of hemorrhoids. With a disruption in natural order, the public&#39;s behavior further deteriorates; now hemorrhoids have developed into twenty-five different categories. They may present on either the left or right side, as internal or external, resembling either mouse milk or cherries, and may manifest as pus or blood, causing pain or itchiness, swelling or hardness. If untreated for long, they may ultimately develop into a chronic condition.</p>
<p>The primary treatment involves cooling the blood gradually. One must never use arsenic or toxic drugs, nor should one carelessly resort to surgical removal, as this may lead to chronic sores. There is also a separate channel at the anus, which secretes pus and blood, known as a single leak. For its treatment, one should use warming medicines to nourish the interior and apply restorative ointments externally. Openings in the skin are easier to heal, but those resulting from internal damage are more challenging to treat.</p>
<p>Lotus seed hemorrhoids resemble lotus seeds. Connecting intestinal hemorrhoids have their roots inside the organs and incur when defecating. Qi hemorrhoids manifest upon exposure to certain airs. Leak hemorrhoids occur due to weakened qi and blood from prolonged fatigue and indulgence without proper cleansing. Hooked intestinal hemorrhoids wrap around the head of the intestine. Lotus flower hemorrhoids resemble lotus flowers.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Hemorrhoids resembling a chicken heart are termed &quot;chicken heart hemorrhoids.&quot; Those that hang down like pearls are called &quot;pearl hemorrhoids.&quot; &quot;Pierced hemorrhoids&quot; are those that are penetrated and exude pus and blood. &quot;Chestnut hemorrhoids&quot; resemble chestnuts. &quot;Angular hemorrhoids&quot; have sharp angles. &quot;Looping intestine hemorrhoids&quot; are found within the coiled intestines. &quot;Parent-child hemorrhoids&quot; consist of one large and one small. &quot;Flipping flower hemorrhoids&quot; appear like a flower flipped open, emerging immediately upon using the toilet. &quot;Mouse milk hemorrhoids&quot; resemble mouse milk. &quot;Double-headed hemorrhoids&quot; have two ends. &quot;Pressing intestinal hemorrhoids&quot; are those that tightly press against the anus. &quot;Blood attacking hemorrhoids&quot; are those that bleed. &quot;Couple hemorrhoids&quot; consist of one round and one long, representing male and female. &quot;Coral hemorrhoids&quot; resemble coral. &quot;Prolapsed hemorrhoids&quot; are those that descend below the anus. &quot;Hanging intestine hemorrhoids&quot; are those that lie horizontally at the anus. &quot;Three confounding hemorrhoids&quot; have three beads, representing confusions of wealth, alcohol, and lust, which are indeed the causes of the illness. &quot;Cherry hemorrhoids&quot; resemble cherries. &quot;Male and female hemorrhoids&quot; arise from indulgence in alcohol, lust, and toxic food, resulting in one being black and the other white. </p>
<p>The above hemorrhoids have different names but belong to the same category. Why? They all arise from the colon&#39;s pathway, with deep wind-heat and kidney deficiency leading to a clash of cold and heat. Overindulgence in pork, chicken, fish, raw food, strong liquor, spicy flavors, or a lack of cleanliness in toilet habits can cause wind evils and be affected by the six qi and seven emotions. Even those who normally do not drink can suffer from hemorrhoids due to visceral weakness. Some are hereditary, formed from the mother&#39;s blood and father&#39;s essence. Intestinal wind is a progressive factor of blood hemorrhoids; thus, promptly take cooling blood tonics. Maintain a light workload, avoid anger, steer clear of lust, and be careful with diet, then healing can be achieved.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Prolapse of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The lungs and large intestine are interrelated, so when the lungs are filled with heat, the anus becomes closed and constipated; when the lungs are weak and cold, the anus prolapses. This is a principle that is quite evident. Additionally, women who have experienced excessive childbirth may become exhausted and lose blood, leading to a deficiency of qi that causes downward displacement; similarly, children with prolonged diarrhea can also have a protruding anus. The treatment should focus on warming and nourishing the lungs and replenishing the intestines and stomach, which over time can lead to natural retraction. </p>
<p>For prolapse due to blood deficiency, the primary remedy is the Four Substance Decoction. For prolapse due to qi deficiency, the focus should be on ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. For blood heat, the emphasis should be on cooling the blood, utilizing the Four Substance Decoction with the addition of Coptis.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Pubic Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This toxin is obtained through hard work and arises above the impoverished bone cavity. If not treated quickly, the toxin will break through and harm the channels, rotting the internal organs and leading to death. Urgently take a detoxifying drink.</p>
<p><strong>Saddle Sores</strong></p>
<p>This toxic sore arises from a deficiency in the kidney channel, where the heat toxins damage the interior. The toxins accumulate in the large intestine, manifesting as sores. First, use a detoxifying soup, then a remedy to dispel toxins and restore energy, followed by a drink to eliminate internal toxins.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Toxins</strong></p>
<p>Internal toxins occur at the end of the large intestine, near the anus. Their nature is fierce, stemming from unpredictable emotions, irregular eating, imbalance of yin and yang, and disharmony among the internal organs. It may arise from excessive sexual activity, drinking strong alcohol, or consuming pungent and spicy foods, leading to toxin accumulation within. This can develop into swelling and pain near the anus, with hard stools causing distension and pain. Smaller ones may appear like beads, while larger ones resemble plum pits. They can create heat from cold and cause excruciating pain, leading to significant swelling and protrusion. Early treatment leads to easy recovery; neglect can lead to pus and decay. Deep ulcers of about an inch are difficult to heal, while those discharging pus and blood leading to reduced swelling and pain are easier to recover from.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>Buttock Abscess</h3>
<p>This abscess occurs in the kidney channel, and the buttock belongs to the lesser yang and bladder, which are the deepest of the yin, with pathways that are distant and remote, making them difficult for medicinal power to reach; hence, prior supplementation is necessary. This occurs due to a combination of deficiency, cold, dampness, and toxins that gather to create wind, leading to this condition. One should use medications that assist from above and below to treat it, such as the Baidu Liqi Decoction, Neitui Liqi Decoction, and Neitui Qianghuo Soup.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>The wind-heat hemorrhoid condition arises from the hand taiyin and hand yangming channels responding to the arteries, indicating that the lung and large intestine are interconnected, serving as conduits for the waste. There are five types of wind-heat hemorrhoids, each with differing symptoms. This is due to the qi of yang being deficient, resulting in a blocked original residence, allowing wind pathogenic factors to invade, leading to the creation of heat. Wind, dampness, and heat attack the intestines, causing the stools to be dry, hot, and obstructed, while blood heat disperses and overflows, soaking the intestines. Thus, the pattern of going to the bathroom first and then bleeding indicates heat is in the lower area, whereas bleeding first and then the bowel movement indicates heat is in the upper area. If it remains unresolved for long, it develops into hemorrhoids. The “Suwen” states: Overeating leads to the loosening of the meridians, causing marital strain and resulting in the intestines to become inflamed, which leads to hemorrhoids. This is because the wind and heat do not disperse, and the food qi overflows, transferring to the lower regions, resulting in swelling at the anus, forming knots as hard as plum or jujube pits; in severe cases, it may even develop into a fistula.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The five internal organs should be well-maintained and not allowed to be harmed by external evils. The Hand Yangming (Large Intestine) is termed &quot;harmful to the Flying Insects.&quot; According to the &quot;Theory of Six Origins and Proper Organization&quot;: Yangming is the governor of the killing chamber, and the Large Intestine is called harmful to the Flying Insects, indicating that metal can damage the five insects. It also states: the killing chamber signifies that metal governs killing. Given these two names, how can insects arise? This is because the fire of the three energizing compartments is excessive, capable of restraining the Yangming metal, thus wood comes to insult it. The text states: to insult means to overcome oneself; wood governs the birth of the five insects. Shuhe states: Stagnant Qi accumulates next to the spleen, causing the Large Intestine to experience painful spasms that are hard to endure. It is only wise to slightly drain the heat from the three compartments and not to hastily adopt many methods to establish clarity and principles. This means that excessive drinking and consuming hot foods generate great heat in the spleen, thus enhancing the Qi of the three compartments, while fire can generate earth. One should drain the fire and heat from the three compartments so that metal can regain its Qi and counteract wood. When wood is restrained, the five insects will not be born, and the illness will naturally heal.</p>
<p>&quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding proctoptosis (rectal prolapse):</p>
<p>When there is severe heat in the Large Intestine, use the water from sour jujube boiled three to five times, slightly warm, to wash three to five times; then apply a bitter remedy to strengthen it, and the condition will improve.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Intestinal Pain</strong></p>
<p>The treatment method is the same as above. Additionally, Da Huang Qian Niu Wan San (a medicinal formula) can be used to overcome it, with the considerations being the same for both dry and moist conditions. The treatment for hemorrhoids, intestinal pain, and rectal bleeding all follows the same principle of addressing internal toxin.</p>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids Swelling and Pain</strong></p>
<p>For milk hemorrhoids and intestinal wind, there must be a mass on the left and right of the anus, corresponding to the large intestine channel; one may take medicinal substances like Zhike (bitter orange). A major mass causing intestinal wind, connected to milk hemorrhoids. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; swelling and pain from hemorrhoids result from overeating, causing tension in the sinews, leading to intestinal splintering resulting in hemorrhoids. If not resolved, it turns into leakage. The treatment for hemorrhoids and leakage follows the same method. The &quot;Essential Discussion&quot; states: When the Yang energy is excessive, condensation occurs, not due to seasonal water freezing, producing hemorrhoids and malaria. The annotation explains that excessive water energy overwhelms Yang fire. This indicates that Yang fire fears water, stagnating and causing hemorrhoids. Additionally, for lesser Yin returns, rashes and sores, carbuncles, and hemorrhoids can arise. The annotation explains that internal fire steams up while metal energy outside resists, causing internal heat stagnation, resulting in rashes and sores. Severe rashes can also lead to sores. When heat is low, external rashes develop; when heat is high, internal carbuncles form. If there is heat in the small intestine, it can externally lead to hemorrhoids. The transformation of heat typically affects the back and outer side of the body. Furthermore, the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: When the solar channel is deficient, it results in hemorrhoids, malaria, and convulsions. This is due to water deficiency being overrun by fire. One may first use Daoshui Wan (a medicinal formula), Yu Gong San (a formula), and purgation; then take Zhike Wan (bitter orange pill) and Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan (a formula with nutmeg and betel nut); additionally, using sunflower and spinach to facilitate bowel movements. It is crucial to avoid cohabitation, chicken, fish, alcoholic vinegar, and spicy hot foods.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: When one indulges in excessive eating, the sinews and vessels become obstructed, leading to hemorrhoids. The large intestine is associated with the metal element, which governs fluids; its nature is dry and clear, and it has a regulating energy that oversees the retention of fluids, contributing to the transformation from the foot Yangming. If this transformation is robust, it gives rise to all things. The foot Yangming represents the fertile land of the Central Plains; when it weakens, it can destroy all things, hence it is said that all things are born from the earth and return to it. However, the hands and feet of Yangming together govern this transformation. Being situated in the western region, it is susceptible to various harms, particularly through overindulgence in food and sexual activity leading to constipation. The energy from the anterior orifice returns to the large intestine, allowing the wood element to overpower the fire element, thereby disrespecting the dry metal element. With fire igniting dryness, constipation inevitably arises, resulting in hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>For those with severe illness, one should use bitter cold to purge heat, use pungent warmth to harmonize blood and moisten dryness, and use herbs to disperse wind and relieve pain, which is the treatment approach. Use Gentiana and the shoots of Angelica to harmonize blood and moisten dryness; use peach kernels to moisten blood; use soapberry seeds to eliminate wind and dryness; use earth catalpa to break blood and stop bleeding; use bitter cold from bitter orange to tonify the kidneys and address excess in the stomach; use the lightness of polygala to drain and return energy to the lower regions to replenish dryness and avoid dampness from the stomach; use white atractylodes with its bitter and sweet flavors to supplement the insufficient dry energy with its sweetness helping to purge heat and benefit the original energy. Thus, it is said that sweet cold purges heat, relying on the cold nature of bitter orange. The ancients utilized medicine to focus on the lower abdomen as a channel, and it is said that for those below, one should draw out and drain it, often leading to constipation, which can be relieved with rhubarb; when fluids and blood are insufficient, Angelica can harmonize blood along with oily, moistening medications to naturally soften and ease bowel movements.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>One should prepare a decoction and use it, as this is a method to urgently treat the heat in the lower body. The herb Di Yu is sour and bitter and can harm the stomach; therefore, it is recommended to consume a pill made from fully digested food on an empty stomach, called the Qin Jiao Bai Zhu pill. If there is white pus, add five flower heads of white chrysanthemum, removing the calyx and heart, and half a monetary unit of green peel without discarding the white part, and boil these with the main medicine. Powder three parts of Mu Xiang finely and combine it with Bingtang and two other ingredients, preparing and taking them as before. In ancient times, this ailment was often treated over the years; this medicine can cure it immediately upon taking it. </p>
<p>As for the symptoms of hemorrhoids, there are five names: one is female hemorrhoids, two is male hemorrhoids, three is gas hemorrhoids, four is blood hemorrhoids, and five is wine hemorrhoids. Additionally, there are names like intestinal wind hemorrhoids, pulse hemorrhoids, and male and female hemorrhoids, all of which are alternate names for the five hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The initial condition presents itself around the anus, resembling either mouse’s milk or small nodules, causing itching and pain, with severe cases leading to body heat and aversion to cold. Various discussions suggest that this arises from excessive indulgence in wine and rich foods, careless overindulgence can disrupt the balance of yin and yang, disturb the blood vessels, and lead to inflammation and leakage in the intestines. This results in sores around the anus, transforming into hemorrhoids. The treatment begins at the first sign of hemorrhoids by taking pills to promote circulation or pills made from sophora fruit. For those with heat symptoms, drinking various purging decoctions to clear the organ systems and bathing or steaming to disperse the problem is recommended. One must avoid alcohol, spicy, and fatty foods. If desires are not reined in, it may lead to festering wounds, or the lingering of pus and blood, and with time, it may develop into anal fistulas, requiring the use of specialized instruments for treatment, which may necessitate three to five applications for recovery. If one can appreciate the flavor of emptiness, the true flavor is sufficient; if one can understand the matter of having no matter, all matters are adequately prepared. Additionally, taking medicinal formulas that adjust conditions carefully and appropriately has led to no reported failures.</p>
<p><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong> 【Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng】</p>
<p><strong>Prolapsed Anus</strong></p>
<p>A prolapsed anus is associated with excess heat in the qi, qi deficiency, blood heat, and blood deficiency. Those with qi deficiency should tonify qi with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and bulbus lonicerae. For blood deficiency, the Four Substance Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Those with hot blood should cool the blood using Si Wu Decoction with roasted Huangbo. For those with hot Qi, take six taels of Qiao Qin and one tael of Sheng Ma, and prepare into a pill form; externally use powdered Wu Bei Zi to apply on the affected area. If the treatment does not take effect after one application, continue for five to seven times until improvement is seen. Additionally, soak the local soil in warm water from the northeast direction, first fumigate and then wash.</p>
<p>The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; therefore, if there is heat accumulation in the lungs, it can lead to rectal closure, and if the lungs are deficient and cold, it may lead to rectal prolapse. Furthermore, complications from childbirth and prolonged diarrhea in children can also contribute to this condition. Thus, it is essential to warm the lungs and nourish the intestines, as prolonged treatment will naturally resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids primarily focus on cooling the blood. Hemorrhoids are due to the inherent weakness of the internal organs, external injuries from wind and dampness, internal accumulation of heat toxins, and excessive eating and drinking, which lead to a downward descent of Qi and blood, causing congestion around the rectum, which results in hemorrhoids. </p>
<p>There are different types: external hemorrhoids present as fleshy protrusions resembling mouse nipples, often dripping pus and blood, referred to as male hemorrhoids. Inflammation and pain near the anus leading to the formation of a single protrusion that ruptures to discharge pus is known as female hemorrhoids. Large, painful, and itchy growths at the anal region with bleeding are termed pulse hemorrhoids. Internally generated lumps with blood, experiencing alternating cold and heat, and causing prolapse is known as intestinal hemorrhoids. If it is blood hemorrhoids, there is continuous clear blood discharge with defecation. If alcohol hemorrhoids, the swelling and pain are triggered by alcohol consumption, accompanied by bleeding.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>If there is heat in the hemorrhoids, it causes anxiety, fear, depression, and anger. When approaching the issue, one immediately observes swelling and pain, along with difficulty in defecation. Forcing may lead to the anus protruding and not retracting. These are external symptoms of hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>The treatment method is primarily to alleviate heat, regulate blood, and smooth the qi. When there is heat, it injures the blood; when the blood is injured, the meridians become stagnant; when the meridians are stagnant, the qi does not circulate. Both qi and blood become stagnant and may fall into the large intestine, which is the cause of hemorrhoids. If hemorrhoids do not heal over time, they will inevitably lead to fistulas.</p>
<p>If the hemorrhoid heads point upwards, it indicates severe heat in the large intestine, leading to retraction and elevation. One should use the Four Substance Decoction to detoxify, adding bitter orange peel, white atractylodes, sophora flower, and gentian.</p>
<p>If one wants to cool and expand the large intestine, use bitter orange peel to remove the pulp, then incorporate Japanese arrowroot inside, tightly wrap with iron wire, and boil thoroughly. After that, remove the arrowroot and use the remaining medicine. If preparing pills, pound it into a paste; if making a decoction, use it in its dry form.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>To address leakage sores, one must first take restorative medicine to promote Qi and blood, primarily using ginseng, atractylodes, astragalus, angelica, and red peony, in large doses. Externally, mix the powdered aconite with saliva to form cakes about the thickness of coins and apply moxibustion. The size of the moxibustion should correlate with the size of the leak: larger moxibustion for larger leaks, smaller for smaller leaks. Ensure that the application is only mildly warm and does not cause pain. If the mixture dries out, replace it; otherwise, grind it again into powder, form cakes, and repeat the moxibustion. If it becomes too laborious, pause and resume the next day until the flesh is smooth. Using aconite slices for moxibustion is also effective, and applying the previous restorative medicine as a poultice yields excellent results.</p>
<p>For the orifice, use red stone resin, white stone resin, burnt alum, yellow orpiment, and camphor. To block the orifice, use a young boy&#39;s urine to calcine gypsum and oyster shell powder. Additionally, prepare a decoction using gallnut, sublimate, mulberry mistletoe, and lotus seed husks, first fumigating, then washing. If swollen, apply a fine powder mixture of rotenone and gallnut.</p>
<p>For leakage, focus primarily on cool medicines.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The term &quot;leak&quot; refers to various types of fistulas. The ancient texts speak of nine types of fistulas, namely, wolf fistula, rat fistula, mole fistula, locust fistula, bee fistula, ant fistula, grub fistula, floating maggot fistula, and cramp fistula. If we analyze them, there are thirty-six types with different names. Generally speaking, external injuries, the four seasons, internal distress from the seven emotions, dietary irregularities, exposure to harmful influences, and the ingestion of toxic substances can all lead to the formation of fistulas and sores. If a hole becomes deeply penetrated and the pus does not cease, combined with cold and wind pathogens, it gradually becomes a leak. There are recent leaks and long-standing leaks. Recent ones appear with a light red color, possibly slightly swollen or with small nodules; long-standing ones become dry and white on the surface, black and rotten inside, with foul-smelling parasites emerging.</p>
<p>Regarding buttock abscesses, some say: Is it not a lack of blood and an excess of qi in the Taiyang channel? Why then do buttock abscesses arise without much suffering initially, and often there are cases where help is not sought? Can you treat them? I say: The buttocks are located at the back of the lower abdomen and are very much in the depths, representing the yin of yin. Their pathways are distant, and their position is secluded. Even if there is much blood, the qi cannot reach it; when qi does not reach, blood is also rarely present. After middle age, if an abscess develops, there will only be pain and swelling. If we examine the pulse and symptoms, we will see weakness, and one should supplement to ensure that blood and qi are not deficient, so that one can ultimately avoid misfortune. If one uses regular medicines to dispel heat, draw out toxins, and soothe qi in a situation of weakness, the disaster is akin to poking at the palm with a finger.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong><br><strong>By Luo Tianyi, Yuan Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Piles and Fistulas</strong></p>
<p>Intestinal wind and piles are general terms, but they differ in specifics. If it ruptures, it is called a fistula; if there is constipation, it will certainly cause great pain. This is due to wind and heat invading the stomach, leading to fullness that isn&#39;t released, causing pressure on the large intestine. Therefore, it is said in the classics: “Due to excessive eating, the meridians are obstructed, resulting in piles.” Those afflicted have dry heat. The illness is due to heat in the stomach. When the stomach punishes the large intestine, it turns moist heat into dryness and taps into the real essence of dryness and heat. Wind attaching to heat appears as a combination of dampness, heat, wind, and dryness, hence the hardened mass at the head of the large intestine indicates dampness, while severe pain is caused by wind, and dry, hard stools indicate a disease combined with the invasion of fire and heat. All four of these factors must be addressed. The lungs in the west govern all qi and, being contractive, can also contribute to the illness as an evil influence; thus, it is necessary to use qi-dispersing herbs alongside treatment for a complete approach. Pills should not be made; it is effective to administer as a powder through a sifter, yielding remarkable results. The Qin Jiao and Cang Zhu Decoction is indicated for this condition.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p>
<h3>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids (Prolapse of the Rectum)</strong></p>
<p>Prolapse of the rectum is most difficult to treat with medication. If there is heat, the anus closes; if there is cold, the anus prolapses. Internally, use two qian (a unit of weight) of powdered magnetite, mixed with rice water before meals; externally, wash with a warm solution of rust.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction of Hemorrhoids, Fistula, and Blood from Intestinal Wind</strong></p>
<p>Blood from intestinal wind comes from within the intestines, whereas blood from hemorrhoids emerges from the dirty openings of the anus; the treatments differ. The Wuzuo Wulian Decoction is used for pulse hemorrhoids. If there is a shape with blood flowing like an arrow or dripping continuously, it originates from the pulse orifices.</p>
<p><strong>Combination of Internal and External Treatments for Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of hemorrhoids and fistulas vary greatly. Since the blood comes from within, one cannot rely solely on external application; it is advisable to take pills such as Kuan San for internal treatment. If there is profuse bleeding during hemorrhoid onset, it is also best to treat from the inside, using a formula to replenish internally, reducing the quantity of cassia by half and adding tortoise shell blood for better results. </p>
<p>If the lower part of the colon protrudes by more than an inch and is painful, one should wait for it to retract. If it keeps protruding, this is termed &quot;interrupted bowel disease.&quot; If the bowel completely protrudes without treatment, only the initial inch can be treated. Use sesame oil in a vessel to sit on, and drink several sheng of hemp seed juice to achieve a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Parasitic Infection at the Anus</strong></p>
<p>If the parasitic infection at the anus does not stop and reoccurs, hindering movement and sitting, take five qian of powdered herb known as crane&#39;s tail mixed with water to drink for self-cure.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Alternate Names for the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The anus is the lower segment of the large intestine. It is also referred to as the broad intestine, which indicates that it is wider than the small intestine. Additionally, it is called the &quot;gate of the soul,&quot; as the large intestine is the organ associated with the lungs, which house the &quot;soul.&quot; The term &quot;anus&quot; refers to its shape, resembling a wheel hub.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Rectal Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; in cases of illness, what enters the body is considered real, while what exits is regarded as false. If the anus prolapses, it is not considered a false condition. Factors include excessive labor during sexual activity, prolonged exertion during childbirth, chronic dysentery, chronic diarrhea, and excessive crying from infants, all of which may lead to this condition. It is advisable to take a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and bulbus, with a little schisandra. In cases of blood deficiency, add peony and rehmannia; for deficiency with cold, add roasted black ginger; and for deficiency combined with heat, use &quot;Suo Sha San.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is heat present alongside the prolapse, heat causes circulation. For heat due to qi, use six taels of qinghao and one tael of angelica, mixed into pills. For blood heat, use the &quot;Four Substance Decoction&quot; with the addition of huanglian and angelica. For wind pathogens, use the &quot;Baiduhong San.&quot; For summer heat, use huanglian in ejiao pills or mint decoction.</p>
<p>The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; if lung heat is present, the anus can become congested, whereas lung cold can lead to prolapse. It is essential to warm the lung and nourish the spleen and stomach, using &quot;Jia Jian Bao Zheng Tang&quot; with a small amount of haritaki and mulberry bark. Alternatively, use &quot;Sheng Yang Ju Jing Tang,&quot; &quot;Wei Pi San,&quot; or &quot;Diao Chang Wan.&quot; If there is damp-heat, employ &quot;Sheng Yang Chu Shi Tang.&quot; If there is concurrent dysentery, use the &quot;Four Substance Decoction&quot; with sophora flavescens, huanglian, and angelica. For kidney deficiency, use &quot;Shen Qi Wan&quot; or &quot;Ba Wei Wan.&quot;<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Buttock Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If it initially shows no pus, apply garlic moxa and then use the scallion compress method. If pus is about to form, take Qianghuo Decoction internally. For severe pain, use the Huoming Drink. For swelling that is hard and painful, use the Tuli Xiaodu San. For slight swelling and pain, use the Tuli San. If there is spleen deficiency that prevents resolution or if the appetite is poor and no pus forms, take Liu Junzi Decoction with added Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, and Astragalus. This is especially suitable for those with issues on the right buttock and leg. If there is kidney deficiency leading to inability to resolve, or if there are symptoms of thirst and painful urination, use Shenqi Pill. In cases of spleen deficiency with substantial gas buildup causing severe swelling and pain, use the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction or the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. After the abscess ruptures, it is especially advisable to take these two medicines to help stabilize the interior. Additionally, avoid alcohol and rich foods, and refrain from excessive or violent behavior for complete recovery.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p>
<h3>Buttocks Maggot Sore</h3>
<p>For buttocks maggot sores that are painful and itchy, use Feng ointment. If it is just very itchy with an abundance of worms, use one tael of sulfur, which people say is pulverized into powder, mix with vinegar, and slowly heat it until it dries. Revive it in heat; when the fire rises, sprinkle vinegar several times, pour it onto the ground, wait for it to cool and solidify into a cake. Grind it with sesame oil until thick, apply to the sore when it itches and has been scratched, and it will heal in three days.</p>
<h3>Five Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>The Classic states: overeating causes the muscles and veins to become unbound, leading to intestinal polyps that result in hemorrhoids. Overeating causes the spleen to be unable to function, causing food to accumulate in the large intestine. When the spleen is weak, the lungs lose nourishment, and the liver becomes timid. Wind pathogens take advantage of this weakness and flow downwards, leading to light cases of intestinal wind and blood, and in severe cases, it transforms into hemorrhoids. Alternatively, becoming drunk and overeating in bed causes the essence and energy to leak, allowing heat and toxins to descend. Or excessive indulgence in bed can damage the muscles, leading to the retention of essence and toxins. In severe cases, this can result in sexual acts between men, injuring the bladder, kidneys, and liver sinews. The bladder meridians connect to the waist, which leads to the kidneys, also runs to the liver, and encircles the front and back yin. Therefore, hemorrhoids are considered a disease of the meridians; when they appear, the face will turn blue, and there will be intense pain, indicating liver distress. </p>
<p><strong>The Five Hemorrhoids:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Male Hemorrhoid</strong>: resembles a rat&#39;s milk near the anus.  </li>
<li><strong>Female Hemorrhoid</strong>: a sore forms by the anus that sinks in.  </li>
<li><strong>Intestinal Hemorrhoid</strong>: a nodular swelling in the intestines, with prolapse and bleeding.  </li>
<li><strong>Blood Hemorrhoid</strong>: bright red blood flows like a thread with bowel movements.  </li>
<li><strong>Pulse Hemorrhoid</strong>: frequent passage of blood from the rectum (indicating pain and itchiness).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Five Hemorrhoids Powder is the main treatment for this condition.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>There are also conditions of qi hemorrhoids, where the anus is swollen and painful, making it difficult to pass stool. Straining causes the anus to not contract. Prescription: added flavored Xiangsu powder. For wine hemorrhoids, they flare up with alcohol consumption; use Gan Ge soup. For worm hemorrhoids, which are soaked and rotten, accumulating over the years, eroding the intestines and creating holes; use Wei Pi pill and Heiyu pill. Generally, for deep toxins, they are as large as a chicken comb, lotus flower, or walnut; for superficial toxins, they are as small as pine nuts, cow&#39;s milk, chicken heart, mouse milk, or peach kernel, all indicating triple yin deficiency. Hemorrhoids are not caused by external evils but rather by internal damp heat, wind dryness, and the four qi combining, lingering in the large intestine and turning into toxins. If there are lumps at the intestinal entrance, it&#39;s dampness; if the anus feels heavy and swollen, it&#39;s damp combined with heat; pus and bloody water indicate heat overpowering blood; extreme pain indicates fire heat; pain and itching indicate wind heat; constipation indicates dry heat; frequent urination indicates liver fire damp heat. Moreover, if the sore head points upward or is hard, there is more heat; if it points down or is soft, there is more moisture. Heat injures the blood, and when the blood stagnates, qi cannot circulate, causing pain and heaviness in the lower intestine. Key treatments include Huaihua and Huai Jiao to cool the blood, Xiong, Gui, and Taoren to harmonize and nourish blood, Zhike to move qi and widen the intestines, Qin, Lian, and Shan Zhi to clear heat, Huanglian, Fangji, and Zexie to expel dampness, Ma Ren and Dahuang to moisten dryness, and Qin Jiao and Jingjie to dispel wind. For wind evil deeply entrenched below, use Fangfeng and Shengma to lift it.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>For those with weak qi, replenish with ginseng and astragalus. If qi is not smooth, harmonize with agarwood and betel nut. For ancient prescriptions for heat-related hemorrhoids, consider Huanglian Ejiao pills, Huai Jiao pills, or Huai Dan pills. For damp-heat, add ingredients to Lianke pills, or combine Siwu Decoction with Baiduxian powder. For wind-damp, use Qinjiao Decoction. For dry hemorrhoids, apply Si Shun Qingliang Drink. For rectal bleeding, use Xiong Gui pills or Ku Shen pills. For pain relief, employ Zhiting pills. For itching, apply Heiyu Dan. For swelling and hardness, use Tunwei pills.</p>
<p>For cuts from knives or scrapes that damage internal organs and threaten life, use medicinal powders or dressings to treat toxins and odor. Initially, only apply garlic moxibustion. For advanced conditions, use a decoction of Fangfeng, Jingjie, Huaihual, Mubei, and (Shibu) nitrate for fumigation and washing. For slippery conditions, add clams and lotus seeds for washing, followed by applying ancient Xiong Bing ointment and centipede oil. For internal hemorrhoids, use Neishengji pills. Avoid applying medicines topically.</p>
<p>For those with robust bodies, associated with lung and large intestine wind-heat, use enhanced Huai Jiao pills, enhanced Dihuang pills, or San Shen pills for easier resolution. For those with thin bodies, associated with deficiencies in liver, spleen, and kidney yin essence, use Shenqi pills, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, or Shiquan Dabu Decoction to nourish the source of digestion; further, regulate desires, maintain a balanced lifestyle, for total resolution.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>There are also cases of combined lower sores, those with a white discharge from the stem, and those with hernias, all resulting from insufficient liver and kidney function; one should not solely rely on cool, purging methods. Hemorrhoids and the five types of hemorrhoids arise from excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust, leading to these ailments. Many people treat externally through washing and applications, unaware that the disease is due to intestinal worms, and if the root is not addressed, the condition will not be resolved.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids can involve perforation of the intestines, the buttocks, or the genitals; there are also cases without hemorrhoids where a separate opening develops on either side of the anus, leaking pus and blood, known as a single discharge. Openings within the skin heal easily, while those affecting internal organs are more difficult to treat. Additionally, existing hemorrhoids could lead to the formation of an abscess at the edge of the anus, discharging through the hemorrhoid opening, indicating the presence of food stagnation; this should be treated with combined Weisang.</p>
<p>Bleeding hemorrhoids are fundamentally caused by heat. The discharge of pus and blood begins as damp heat, and over time, becomes damp cold. Initially, the symptoms appear as light red with slight swelling and small nodules, which should be treated with cooling blood and clearing heat to dry dampness, using remedies like Qian Niu Jiu, Jia Wei Huai Jiao Wan, Zang Tou Wan, Gu Zhi Ba Wan, and Lian Gui Wan. In long-standing cases, the internal condition appears as dried white, while the external shows black decay with a foul smell from parasitic worms; thus, it is necessary to drain openings, kill worms, and provide warmth and nourishment, using remedies like Hei Yu Dan, Diao Chang Wan, Xiong Gui Wan, Ku Shen Wan, and La Fan Wan. There are also cases that initially arise from wind-cold but may develop into deficiency combined with damp heat over time.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case - Ming Dynasty by Xue Ji</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prolapse of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>Prolapse of the anus is related to deficiency of qi and blood in the large intestine, compounded by damp-heat. Some cases arise from chronic diarrhea leading to both qi and blood deficiency; others stem from lung deficiency; some are due to deficiency of middle qi; and others result from kidney deficiency. For damp-heat, use Shengyang Zhushi Decoction. For blood-heat, incorporate Siwu Decoction with Scutellaria and Sophora flowers. For blood deficiency, add Baizhu and Poria to Siwu Decoction. If accompanied by hemorrhoids and pain, combine Siwu Decoction with Sophora flower, Coptis, and Cimicifuga. For chronic diarrhea, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with wine-fried Peony. In cases of middle qi deficiency causing prolapse, add Banxia, Paojiang, Poria, and Wuwu to the previous decoction. For kidney deficiency, apply Liuwei Dihuang Wan. For deficiency-cold, use Bafang Wan. The lungs and large intestine are interrelated; the anus is the gateway of the large intestine. If the lungs are in excess heat, this leads to constipation; if the lungs are deficient and cold, this causes prolapse. The kidneys govern bowel movements, hence those with kidney deficiency often suffer from this condition.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p>
<h3>Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>Constipation or painful bowel movements: moisten dryness and eliminate dampness.<br>Feeling a heaviness or pain in the anus: drain heat and guide out dampness.<br>If there is heaviness, swelling, or itching: expel wind and overcome dampness.<br>Swelling and painful urination with stagnation: clear the liver and guide out dampness.<br>Hemorrhoids can affect men and women of all wealth levels. The wealthy may suffer from indulgence in wine, lust, and material pursuits, while the poor may experience strain from carrying heavy loads, being hungry, or rising early—these all harm the heart and liver blood. Joy injures the heart, anger injures the liver; fluctuations in emotions can lead to the invasion of qi and blood into the large intestine, causing blockages that accumulate and lead to bleeding and formation of lumps. Women may suffer from cold after menstruation, while irregularities in the menstrual cycle may harm the heart&#39;s blood, leading to blood flowing into the large intestine. Children may be affected by heat during delivery or excess heat in the mother’s womb, resulting in clear liquid and oily matters. Hemorrhoids are associated with the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians; thus, depletion of yin essence makes them difficult to treat and often leads to symptoms of leakage. If the lung and large intestine meridians are affected by wind-heat or damp-heat, recovery may occur spontaneously once the heat subsides. Those who do not adhere to dietary restrictions may also develop symptoms of leakage.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>This condition arises from excessive drinking and eating, leading to the dissolution of tendons and veins, loss of essence, and outflow of energy. Heat and toxins invade the body, or extreme indulgence strongly retains essence, causing wood to overpower fire, thus humiliating metal; or from consuming rich flavors or overexertion damaging the vital energy, resulting in yin deficiency and fiery excess. Initially, there may be burning pain and constipation, or difficulty in urination. It is advisable to clear heat, cool the blood, moisten dryness, and disperse wind. If there is deficiency of qi and blood with cold damage, one should nourish the spleen and stomach, and replenish the yin essence. If the condition breaks and does not heal for a long time, it often leads to hemorrhoids and may include fissures in the anal or genital regions, or perforation of the intestines. Swelling at the intestinal head indicates damp heat; pain indicates wind heat; constipation indicates dry heat; and suppuration indicates heat overpowering blood. Pain during bowel movements should be treated by moistening dryness and eliminating dampness. Pain in the anal area should be treated by dissipating heat and eliminating dampness. If urination is obstructed, one should clear the liver and guide out dampness. For those forming leaks (fistulas), the focus should be on nourishing vital energy and replenishing yin essence. The classics state: &#39;Due to indulgent eating, the tendons and veins become disordered, and the intestines become torn, resulting in hemorrhoids.&#39; This clearly relates to the liver, spleen, and kidneys. If one suffers from hemorrhoids and also has hernias, or has hernias and concurrently has ulcers, these are all transformations due to deficiency in liver and spleen, and one should use Di Huang Wan and Yi Qi Tang to nourish the source of digestion for best results. However, solely relying on cold and cooling treatment for heat will lead to disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: Excessive eating causes the muscles and veins to break apart, leading to hemorrhoids. It also states: The spleen and stomach are the storage organs, where the five flavors emerge. The large intestine is the channeling organ, responsible for transformations. When one overeats excessively, the spleen&#39;s energy becomes severely weakened and cannot process the refined essence, causing damage from morning till evening, resulting in a mix of clarity and turbidity. Therefore, food accumulates and flows downward into the large intestine, causing illness. When the spleen and stomach are deficient, the lung energy is also lacking, resulting in deficiencies in the energy of the large intestine. Consequently, the liver&#39;s wood can freely flow downward, causing intestinal wind disease. These various manifestations, although differing in appearance—such as cow&#39;s milk, mouse milk, chicken hearts, chicken crowns, lotus flowers, flipped flowers, beehives, pierced intestines, and external hemorrhoids—share the same underlying cause. </p>
<p>Treatment methods include: Using bitter cold herbs to purge heat, such as Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, and Sophora flower; employing warm acrid herbs to nourish the blood, including Angelica, Chuanxiong, and peach kernels. If wind evil is present below, use Gentiana, Fangfeng, and Cimicifuga to raise it; if dryness and heat are trapped, employ Rhubarb, Zhi ke, and hemp seeds to adjust. Those suffering from this ailment should be cautious with their diet and desires, and follow the prescribed treatments to ensure peace and comfort.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Remedies: A Discussion on Intestinal Diseases and Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The classics state: When wind invades and mingles with dampness, essence is lost and the liver is harmed by the disturbance. Consequently, if one indulges in excessive eating, the muscles and tendons become entangled, leading to intestinal disorders resulting in hemorrhoids. The reason is that the wind energy connects with the liver, causing the liver to generate wind, which in turn creates heat. When the wind invades, it injures the essence; when the essence is lost, the pathogenic heat harms the liver. Therefore, when one overeats and engages in sexual activity, the muscles and tendons become compromised, resulting in intestinal afflictions and hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids, as mentioned in the &quot;Caoshi Discussion on Diseases,&quot; are classified into five types: male hemorrhoids, female hemorrhoids, pulsatile hemorrhoids, intestinal hemorrhoids, and blood hemorrhoids. Additionally, there are various names for hemorrhoids in ancient formulas, such as wine hemorrhoids, gas hemorrhoids, worm hemorrhoids, flipping flowers, and mole crickets, among others. Moreover, hemorrhoids can appear at the anal region (or be external or internal). They can resemble mouse milk or cherries, with various shapes. The symptoms may include pain and itching, hardness or softness, pus formation, or none, swelling with difficult bowel movements, or continuous bleeding with stools, and in some cases, perforation leading to blood flowing like a thread. There are even cases where improper treatment results in leakage, or perforations leading to feces passing through the openings.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If there are several lesions around the anus that are soaked with pus and blood like lotus flowers, then based on these symptoms, generally speaking: lesions near the anus that produce pus and blood are identified as male hemorrhoids; lesions near the anus that are sore, swollen, and bleeding are identified as female hemorrhoids; lesions near the anus that are both painful and itchy are identified as venous hemorrhoids; internal lumps in the anus with alternating cold and heat and bleeding are identified as intestinal hemorrhoids; swollen and painful anus with difficulty in defecation, where straining leads to protrusion of the anus that does not retract, are identified as gas hemorrhoids; ulcers and swelling around the anus that bleed and flare up with alcohol consumption are identified as alcohol hemorrhoids; if there are openings around the anus with blood spurting out like rays, they are identified as blood hemorrhoids; and if the anus is soaked and rotten, with pinworms eroding the intestines and creating perforations, they are termed as parasitic hemorrhoids. All these conditions originate from the large intestine, which corresponds to the element of metal (in the Five Elements theory). Its nature is dry, clear, and capable of regulatory action, primarily governing the absorption of fluid, transforming the materials derived from the Earth of the foot Yangming. When in a strong state, it can generate and transform all things, while when weakened, it harms everything. Thus, it is said that all things are born from the Earth and return to the Earth. The Yangming of both the hands and feet governs this transformation.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>If a person is drunk and overindulges, their vital essence may be leaked, leaving their pulse empty. The heat from the alcohol becomes toxic and flows through the pulse. This may occur if one becomes drunk and excessively indulgent, and tries to forcefully retain their essence or uses medicine to hold it in, but it cannot be expelled and accumulates in the pulse. It returns to the large intestine, leading to wood overpowering fire and humiliating dry metal. When fire meets dryness, constipation occurs and hemorrhoids develop. Treatment should consist of bitter cold to purge fire, acrid warmth to harmonize blood, moisten dryness, and disperse wind, as well as pain-relieving prescriptions.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the pulse of the foot&#39;s sun bladder and its tendons all connect to the waist and influence the kidneys; its branches pass through the buttocks and feet. Therefore, if the tendons are the cause of a disease, this illness may arise. Additionally, the pulse of the foot&#39;s jueyin encircles the front and back yin, which can also lead to hemorrhoids. When observing someone affected by hemorrhoids, the initial manifestation is often blue in color and extremely painful, indicating that the liver is in distress. </p>
<p>Furthermore, although hemorrhoids and leaking both originate from similar causes, the resulting conditions are indeed different. A hemorrhoid that forms at the edge of the anus and does not rupture is called a hemorrhoid; if it ruptures and discharges pus and blood, with yellow fluid seeping and not stopping for a long time, it is referred to as a leakage. The initial cause of the illness is dryness; the underlying condition is damp heat. The stomach injures the large intestine, leading to the transformation of dry heat that exacerbates the damp heat condition.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If the intestines form lumps, it is due to dampness; if there is pain, it is caused by wind; if pus and blood ooze out, it indicates heat overcoming rotting blood; if it forms yellow fluid, it is a mix of damp heat and wind dryness. If severe pain occurs with constipation, this is due to stagnant wind and heat causing obstruction, preventing passage, with qi pressing on the large intestine. If the large intestine is dry and hardened, it signifies a condition influenced by fire pathogens. All these ailments arise from the combination of dampness, heat, wind, and dryness. The condition of &quot;intestine leakage&quot; refers to blood in the stool. This typically occurs when one does not avoid the toxins of wind, indulges in strong alcohol and roasted foods, and allows emotions of desire and anger to fluctuate, resulting in stagnation in the organs and excess in dietary intake, ultimately harming the gut and leading to disharmony of yin and yang, blockage, and heat toxins descending, causing blood to seep into the large intestine, resulting in leakage and hemorrhoids that cannot be avoided. The classics state: when the muscles and veins are disrupted, and there is intestine leakage as in hemorrhoids, it refers to this. Despite differing names, the source is essentially the same. Generally, the condition of intestine leakage can either be treatable or not. If there is blood in the stool and a cold body, there is hope for survival. If white foam is present in the leakage and the pulse is deep, there is a chance for survival; if the pulse is floating, it is life-threatening. In cases of leaking pus and blood, a strong and smooth pulse indicates survival, while a pulse that is suspended and absent signifies death. For intestine leakage, if the spleen pulse is deep and distended, it may resolve itself over time; if the liver pulse is slightly weak, it is easier to treat; however, if the kidney pulse is deep and the body is hot, it is fatal. The method of treatment should focus on expelling wind, dispelling toxins, relieving heat, cooling the organs, harmonizing blood, and moistening dryness; if these are applied, healing is assured.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>On Rectal Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of rectal prolapse, the Classic of Difficult Issues states: conditions of the body can be categorized as either excess or deficiency; protrusion indicates deficiency, while retraction indicates excess. The protrusion of the anal region stems from deficiency, does it not? If one has excess, it generates warmth, and warmth allows for sufficient internal energy to be stored. If one has deficiency, it leads to coldness, and coldness results in a lack of internal energy that cannot hold. Moreover, the large intestine has thickness and thinness, corresponding to the lungs; when the lung organs possess heat, they close, but if they are deficient, prolapse occurs.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Three Causes&quot; discourse, women who suffer from this ailment often experience it due to excessive straining during childbirth. For children, this condition results from prolonged diarrhea, stemming from a cold and deficient large intestine. The anus is a continuation of the large intestine; if the large intestine is harmed by obstruction and one strains, the energy descends forcefully, causing the anus to prolapse. One can use herbal decoctions of Xiangfuzi (Cyperus) and Jingjie (Schizonepeta) for washing; or grind Wubeizi (Gallnut) into a fine powder, place it on paper, and gently massage it into the anus.</p>
<p>If it persists for a long time, males may develop rectal hemorrhoids, leading to an inability to retract the intestine. For protrusions of several inches, use decoctions of Wubeizi and (Shibai) Nitre for washing; also, use the ashes of horsetail that are not allowed to burn completely, with a small amount of musk, to apply after defecation for effectiveness.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of prolonged diarrhea causing internal deficiency, which can lead to rectal prolapse. If there is itching at the rectum, it indicates the presence of worms in the abdomen, likely due to excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence. The large intestine serves as the pathway for transformation, while the kidneys support strength; thus, if the kidneys are deficient, the vital energy leaks out, causing the lung deficiency, resulting in a lack of control over the large intestine and thus, the prolapse of the anus. </p>
<p>The treatment method focuses on restoring the original energy, removing accumulated heat, and using external washes of decoctions; with proper treatment, healing can invariably be achieved.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>A Song on the Twenty-four Signs of Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>Hemorrhoids are divided into three types, so please observe carefully. Do not let the years pass, for those who see may feel dismayed. The shape of a water chestnut appears strange, while a lotus flower should not be ignored. The intestine is called &quot;mouse&#39;s milk,&quot; which is affected by both alcohol and color. Do not blame the dreadful turn of flowers; a beehive is not spacious either. Male and female share the same blood, affecting both child and mother&#39;s intestines. &quot;Primary pearls&quot; can be particularly alarming, as intestinal pain feels like a drill. Walnuts cause blood flow, making those who see feel saddened. Large chestnuts are inside, while &quot;chicken hearts&quot; are comfortably outside. The form of coral is detestable, how much more difficult is it to deal with prolapse? Internal hemorrhoids are red but do not protrude, lying within the intestines. Prolapsed pearls are even harder to treat; prolonged cases bear a &quot;chicken crown.&quot; Never use sharp knives or fire lightly, for it may cost you your life. After working hard for half a month, the illness may indeed be eradicated. The method of treating hemorrhoids is merely to cool the blood and clear heat. As for treating leakage, initially, it should cool the blood and dry dampness; over time, it should kill insects in the passages while also warming and dispersing. Some say: for leakage and burning, why use warming and drying medicine? They do not know that bleeding from hemorrhoids is ultimately caused by heat. Leakage releases pus, starting as damp heat and ending as damp cold. The &quot;Ten Leaks Golden Pill,&quot; though warm and dispersive, also nourishes. Thus, Danxi says: leakage should primarily focus on greatly supplementing qi and blood, there is a rationale behind this.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The condition of hemorrhoids is caused by cold. The classics state: &quot;When the Yang is victorious, hemorrhoids develop; treat with bitter heat.&quot; </p>
<p>For all hemorrhoids, use the dried medicine of Master Zhou: apply in the morning and once more at noon, washing off the old medicine; at the time of Shen, wash again and apply once more. If urgent relief is needed, wash and apply again at midnight or the early hour. The next day, observe the hemorrhoid head; it should be a faint black color. For two or three days it may resemble dried plum, and within four or five days, use a bamboo stick to gently tap the hemorrhoid head; if it feels as hard as stone by the seventh or eighth day, simply stop further applications and wait for it to resolve naturally, much like the shedding of a radish root. Then use a decoction of licorice, schizope, and sophora flower to wash away the old medicine, and apply the new medicine.</p>
<p>As for methods to treat hemorrhoids: if one intends to begin treatment tomorrow, administer this medicine today to relax the intestines, facilitating smooth bowel movements without causing further issues with hemorrhoids. If the hemorrhoid head has not fallen off, it must be taken daily. Take one ounce of rhubarb simmered, stir-fried bitter orange peel, and one ounce of angelica root washed in wine, all ground to a fine powder, about the size of a tung seed, and swallow with good wine.</p>
<p>To treat with dried medicine for hemorrhoids, be cautious of other symptoms that may arise. The use of dried medicine may harm kidney roots, or cause painful urinary issues. Use one ounce each of rhubarb, houttuynia, and fresh Rehmannia, with half an ounce each of talc and dianthus, all ground to a fine powder. Take four qian each time, boiled and consumed.</p>
<p>To prompt hemorrhoids to fall off: if the dried matter has completely fallen, use this to stimulate it. Take one qian of good magnetite, with half a qian each of white silkworm and live black wyvern, ground to a fine powder, mixed with cold water, and applied topically; it will immediately facilitate detachment.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>When using desiccated medicines to remove the nipple, be cautious to avoid leaving hard hemorrhoids, which could damage the anal region and cause sores around it. Use one qian of dragon bone and gypsum, along with five fen each of myrrh and talcum powder, ground very finely. First clean with a decoction of schizonepeta, then apply this powder. It is strictly forbidden to use toxic substances like fresh ginger. </p>
<p>After hemorrhoids have been expelled, wash with licorice decoction and fermented soybean decoction, then rinse with a decoction of schizonepeta and galla chinensis to prevent pus formation. If the skin becomes itchy after the hemorrhoids are expelled, wash with a strong decoction of ageratum. </p>
<p>For the “Intestinal Recovery Recipe”: Use desiccated medicines to remove the nipple, and immediately use this to recover the intestines. This recipe replenishes qi, absorbs pus, eliminates blood, and promotes flesh growth, ensuring the scar heals completely. </p>
<p>Do not treat hemorrhoids with fresh arsenic, as the toxic gas can enter the abdomen, leading to sudden collapse. Avoid eating raw, cold, or hard substances, cold dishes, and alcohol, as well as moist and spicy items like chili, and ginger, as these will be ineffective if consumed. This is the saying of Dongyuan.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Intestinal pain manifests as hemorrhoids, similar to small mountains protruding from a vast marsh. In the nine orifices of a person, any small flesh that protrudes is called hemorrhoids, not limited to those near the anus. There are nasal hemorrhoids, ocular hemorrhoids, dental hemorrhoids, etc., each with different appearances. The medical texts categorize them into five types: male, female, pulse, intestinal, and gas. </p>
<p>Female hemorrhoids are ulcers that form on the anus, swelling and protruding, often swelling multiple times a day and bursting with pus. Male hemorrhoids exhibit fleshy beads around the anus, resembling mouse milk, and frequently drip pus and blood. Pulse hemorrhoids involve painful and itchy lumps at the intestinal opening, often bleeding profusely. Intestinal hemorrhoids consist of blood clots inside the intestines, accompanied by alternating chills and fevers, leading to mixed prolapse. Gas hemorrhoids flare up with anger, causing swelling and pain at the anus, but improve when the gas is released. </p>
<p>There are also alcoholic hemorrhoids, which flare up with drinking, causing swelling, pain, and bleeding. Blood hemorrhoids result in persistent fresh blood accompanying bowel movements, necessitating treatment to clear heat, regulate blood, and facilitate qi. If not treated for a long time, they may lead to a perforation.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Treatises</strong><br><strong>Ming - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids and Fistulas</strong></p>
<p>Chunfu always employs treatment methods for hemorrhoids and fistulas that do not stray from those addressing damp-heat. The pathogenesis indeed aligns with the discussions of Dongyuan and Danxi. Generally, for mild cases, one can resolve them by draining water, dispersing dampness, moistening dryness, and soothing wind; all these methods can achieve healing. As for severe cases involving penetrating fistulas and connections in the buttocks, where there may be an egg-shaped tube present for a long time, the method from the &quot;Yonglei Qianfang&quot; involving thread treatment is necessary to eradicate the root cause. My colleague Cheng Fuzhai has deeply grasped the essence of this method, truly embodying the principle of pulling out the root and sealing the source, leading to healing without fail. I hereby seek to detail this method and append it for public benefit, hoping it may provide relief to those suffering from this ailment.</p>
<p><strong>Fuzhai&#39;s Method for Treating Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Lun on Vitality&quot; states: Overeating causes muscle and vessels to become strained, leading to intestinal rupture as hemorrhoids. Dongyuan believes that overeating and exerting force during labor result in the damp-heat of the spleen and stomach, which then exerts pressure on the large intestine causing rupture. It also states that overeating while burdened, difficulties in childbirth, and exertion in young children can likewise lead to intestinal rupture. This is indeed the source of the ailment. Thus, in mild cases, the large intestine is partially ruptured, with damp-heat seeping into the inner and outer layers of the intestine, causing it to descend and form nodules internally. They appear like grapes or lotus seed pods, blocking the passage for excretion, leading to prolapse during defecation, requiring time to retract; this is termed &quot;turning flowers.&quot; If due to wind-heat and dry stool, bowel movements become difficult, there can be instances where hemorrhoids rupture before feces are passed, leading to bleeding; similarly, after feces are passed, the hemorrhoids can break, resulting in bleeding. All these conditions stem from internal hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Due to the difficulty in expelling feces, the blood flow differs; thus, there is no consistent principle regarding the distance and timing of blood from intestinal wind. Therefore, when the tear is deep, the large intestine is completely ruptured, and the damp heat qi seeps outside the intestine, lingering in the flesh, flowing laterally outside the anus, forming lumps like cherries, milk, or cockscombs, sometimes connecting to the yin or yang, resulting in abscesses or hanging abscesses; or connecting to the buttocks, leading to buttock abscesses with pus flowing for a long time. Internally, the formations resemble goose tubes and corals, comparable to water in a mountain cave, which, after long dripping, forms stalactites. The branches of the goose tubes proliferate, and the sores are scattered, appearing like a honeycomb or rotten claws, with the skin corroded and flesh sunk, ultimately leading to chronic maladies; all of these stem from external hemorrhoids. Hence, although hemorrhoids can be internal or external, the depths of intestinal tears vary. Those treating the condition do not consider rooting out the source but merely observe that the stool is hard, indicating dryness and heat; after the sores swell, if they become heavy and the intestines form lumps, this indicates dampness and heat; severe pain suggests wind and heat. Parasites erode as wood damages metal; indeed, wood decays first before pests emerge, and once the intestine is ruptured, the poison begins to flow.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>First, one should establish a proper approach to balance the qi and blood, reduce heat and dispel wind, in order to adjust what is inside; additionally, use arsenic to probe the sores, to rot away the necrotic tissue, in order to treat the outside. Observing this, it is merely treating the symptoms and alleviating immediate concerns. If the affected area is close to the anus, and the necrotic tissue is removed, new flesh in the intestinal head may grow, which is merely a fortunate outcome; however, if the area is remote and difficult to access, even if one uses a rod to probe the anal canal, the area may remain large, causing adjacent sores to heal while the main opening proves hard to close, leading to a recurrence soon after, with the blame falling on the patient. I suffered from this ailment for seventeen years, perusing many texts and diligently following ancient treatments, yet all efforts were fruitless; I almost succumbed to arsenic, consumed by anxiety and fear. Later, I encountered Li Chunshan from Jiangyou, who simply used yarrow root boiled into a thread to sew up the large intestine; it took over seventy days to achieve complete success. Reflecting on this experience, I realized the principles. Subsequently, I treated several others, regardless of the number of sores, applying a method to probe a single hole with grass, tying a thread outside the intestine, and using a lead weight to suspend it, seeking quick results.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>When the medicinal thread is placed under the sun, the intestinal muscles grow stronger. With the surrounding area already treated, water flows along the thread, although it has not yet penetrated the wound. The gauze inside is absorbed, and within seven days, the skin returns to its original state. It is akin to building a dam to prevent flooding; once the water has returned to its course and all streams are dry, what flooding could there be? The time for the thread to fall varies based on the distance from the wound, whether a week or half a month, but it does not exceed two weeks. Once the thread has passed beyond the anus, it falls away like a hammer dropped. The herbal treatment promotes muscle regeneration, ensuring success every time. </p>
<p>For internal hemorrhoids, one should apply the medicinal ointment without contamination from arsenic. Alternatively, the medication may be applied to the rectum directly, or one may wait for the hemorrhoid to resolve itself while applying the medicine daily. As the yellow pus dries, the internal hemorrhoids turn black, and in seven to eight days, the necrotic tissue sloughs off. The herbal treatment helps regenerate the muscle, restoring the intestine as it was before. Even if there is residual heat or toxins, they will be expelled with the feces, leaving no further troubles. This is like removing the blockage from the riverbank; once the flow returns to the center, there are no issues of overflow or stagnation.</p>
<p>Recently, due to specific cases of hemorrhoids and fistulas in the regions of Zhejiang and Quzhou with a focus on medicinal treatments, the thread wrapped in spider silk has also achieved significant results for each sore this way. However, its use is aggressive, causing some distress to witnesses, and I do not dare to be selfish regarding the knowledge acquired. Therefore, I have documented this for the benefit of all, to forever eliminate this affliction.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]  </p>

<p>&quot;The Ghost&#39;s Legacy&quot; states: When boils arise on both sides of the drooping bead, it is a pony fall. Initially, the size is uncertain. This area has thin skin and tight patterns, and it is also difficult to close the mouth. At the onset, it is advisable to apply medication to promote internal absorption, but it easily becomes a leaking hardness, making it hard to treat. It is also noted: A boil near the perineum, close to the ridge line, is also considered a pony fall; preventive measures should be taken to avoid leakage.<br><strong>Cross-Horse Filament</strong>  <a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Someone asked about the condition of lesions arising under the back. The response was that this condition is called &quot;perineal lesions,&quot; which pertains to the governing vessel and the Taiyang channel, caused by the accumulation of labor, worry, and emotional distress. For treatment, one can use &quot;Huoming Drink&quot; combined with Qianghuo and Huangbo, internally administered with Qianghuo Decoction, and also utilize Shengjindan and Shensian Chuidu Pills. For strong individuals, take Bajunzhan San or one Shengjindan. For the elderly and weak, use Shiquan Dabu Decoction and Ren Shen Yangrong Decoction. This condition requires prompt treatment; if it lingers, it may become ulcerated and difficult to heal. Those with leakage experience numbness. For symptoms of dark, sunken diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue, do not treat.</p>
<p><strong>Yongquan Lesion</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Guiyi,&quot; Yongquan lesions swell up in the Taiyin area (referring to the lower back area) and resemble a rat lying down. If it persists for twenty days without proper treatment, it will lead to death. It can be punctured after ten days. Lesions that discharge clear pus that is red-black indicate death, while white pus may be treatable.</p>
<p><strong>Buttock Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked what to do when an abscess forms on the buttocks. The answer was that a high, shallow swelling indicates an abscess, while a flat, deep swelling indicates a lesion, both caused by damp heat in the Foot Taiyang channel. It is advisable to take Qianghuo Decoction and a revival powder with Qianghuo. Shengjindan and Huangqi Muxiang San can be selected for treatment. For strong individuals, take one Shengjindan or Bajunzhan San. For the elderly and weak, use Shiquan Dabu Decoction and Ren Shen Yangrong Decoction. Ancients say that this sore must be treated with nourishing agents; lacking such support can lead to further complications after scabbing, making treatment difficult. It is crucial to be cautious and not neglect the nourishing agents. For swelling that does not break, take Taige Zijiwei Wan.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treatments for Prolapse (by Wu Kun, Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>For prolapse due to prolonged diarrhea, the formula by Danxi is primary. Prolonged diarrhea injures qi, and excessive bowel movements deplete yin, leading to deficiency in both qi and blood, resulting in the prolapse of the large intestine. To replenish insufficient qi, a sweet and warm approach is taken, hence using ginseng and astragalus; for insufficient yin, nourishment comes from rich flavors, hence employing angelica and cyperus; for prolapse, lifting herbs are used, hence the use of bulbus. </p>
<p>For prolapse from diarrhea due to deficiency of cold and dampness, the Pill to Lift the Anus is recommended. Excess moisture leads to fluid diarrhea, and prolonged diarrhea results in a weak stomach and cold organs, leaving no yang to lift, causing the anus to prolapse. Dryness can eliminate dampness; therefore, pinellia and south star are used; bitterness combats dampness, thus using both red and white alum; warmth can invigorate the organs, hence black and white aconite are employed. Additional ingredients such as celosia, hedgehog skin, and bitter orange peel can disperse wind; myrobalan, wild yam, and walnut shell ash are utilized to solidify the prolapse.</p>
<p>For prolapse due to heat diarrhea, the anal contraction powder is effective. Heat causes the anus to become dry, making bowel movements difficult, leading to prolapse if straining is prolonged. This differs from cold-induced prolapse, where there is a continuous liquid discharge and dryness is absent. Bitterness can counterheat, hence bear bile is used; dryness can solidify the prolapse, so catechu is utilized; spiciness can dispel pathogenic factors, thus borneol is included.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Hemorrhoids and Fistula</strong></p>
<p>For hemorrhoids and bleeding caused by internal heat, the prescription is Four Substances Decoction with the addition of Scutellaria, Berberine, and Sophora flower. Hemorrhoids are a toxin of the intestines. This condition is often seen in the wealthy who indulge in rich foods, while the poorer classes are rarely affected. When a root of the disease exists, thoughts of labor arise, and drinking alcohol becomes frequent, because of the internal heat causing the blood to flow indiscriminately. This prescription includes fresh Rehmannia, Sophora flower, Scutellaria, and Berberine to clear the heat; and Angelica, Peony, and Chuanxiong to regulate the blood. For those advanced in years and weak in vitality, if hemorrhoid bleeding does not stop, the Four Gentlemen Decoction is the prescription. If one hastily takes strong medicine for hemorrhoids, resulting in excessive and unceasing blood loss, and they become weak or faint, this prescription is also indicated. Blood has a tangible yin aspect but must rely on the intangible qi to stabilize it. Thus, in the elderly with weakened qi, blood will flow downward, and prolonged use of strong medicine can damage qi leading to blood flow. This formula includes Ginseng, Atractylodes, Poria, and Licorice, which are sweet and warm tonic substances. When the qi is abundant, it can stabilize the tangible blood. It is likened to a reservoir filled sufficiently between two banks, which can lift the earth without the risk of collapsing.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>On Hemorrhoids and Various Remedies</strong></p>
<p>In ancient prescriptions for treating hemorrhoids that bleed, there are those that use sophora flower, cypress leaves, hedgehog skin, bee nest, ox horn, walnut ash, etc. These are all methods for treating dry hemorrhoids; within decoctions, there are those that use saposhnikovia root, gentian, soapberry seeds, schizonepeta, and angelica; these are aimed at addressing wind-heat entering the internal organs. Some use Glauber&#39;s salt, rhubarb, betel nut, and bitter orange; these address the presence of excess heat that should be purged. Others use coptis, bitter herb, stone lotus flesh, and gourd seeds, which focus on clearing excess heat. There are those who use peach kernel, safflower, cattail pollen, and red sandalwood, which target the blood stasis that has not yet dissipated. Using apricot kernel, flaxseed, rhizome of rehmannia, and berberine, aims at addressing dryness of metal that lacks moisture. There are those who use earthworm, mugwort, calcined dragon bone, and deer antler powder, which seek to staunch the bleeding. Some use ivory, dung beetles, human nails, and crab claws, intending to apply medicine externally to heal. There are methods of fumigation, washing, and sitting with medicine, all of which target stopping bleeding from dry hemorrhoids; those that use insertion of medicine or hanging threads are focused on removing rotten flesh. Alas! To trust a doctor is akin to trusting a general; to use medicine is like employing military strategy. Mastery of warfare involves strategic placement of stones to form a camp or deploying cattle to break the enemy; mastery of medicine involves understanding the heart, which leads to efficacy, recognizing the subtlety that guides the treatment, thus transcending the limits of mere written prescriptions.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>Hemorrhoids are caused by the accumulation of damp heat and overindulgence in grilled foods, or due to prolonged sitting which obstructs blood circulation. They can also be aggravated by emotional distress, excessive exposure to cold, or by lifting heavy burdens and strenuous travel, leading to chaotic energy and blood flow that entangles the meridians. Moreover, excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence can injure the intestines and stomach, leading to stagnant qi and blood that can flow to the anus, resulting in hemorrhoids. This condition affects both young and old, men and women alike. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the anus or protrude outside it. Treatment must address both internal and external factors separately. Larger hemorrhoids may appear like lotus flowers, beehives, flipped flowers, cockscombs, water chestnuts, or corals, while smaller ones may resemble cherry pits, mouse tails, milk, chicken hearts, walnuts, or clam meat. Thus, those with deeper toxins will exhibit irregular and stubborn shapes, while those with lighter toxins will present more regular and typical forms. Over time, they may rupture and leak, while newer ones can cause swelling and sharp pain. In severe cases, feces may escape from the orifice, and blood may flow from the anal opening, resulting in daily damage to qi and blood, gradually affecting one&#39;s appearance. If not treated early, it can cause significant harm.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Due to the common practice of relying on methods like needle, knife, arsenic, and line-weights, patients suffer greatly, and those who hear of it tend to avoid treatment altogether. I treat this condition with a few herbal ingredients that are refined through fire, yielding a pure and harmonious nature; they have been proven effective time and again. This method is quite different from previous approaches. </p>
<p>For internal hemorrhoids, I first use laxative herbs to cleanse the internal organs; then I apply a hemorrhoid powder to the anus, and in a short time the hemorrhoids will naturally protrude. They are then washed with scallion soup, and the dried hemorrhoid powder is applied three times daily with warm soup for rinsing. For mild cases, this takes seven days; for severe cases, eleven days, after which the hemorrhoids will naturally dry up, turn black, and harden, at which point the drying medicine is stopped. If there are fissures at the hemorrhoid edges with pus, switch to a hemorrhoid-soothing soup, wash once daily. After the hemorrhoids fall off, switch to a wound-healing powder or other medicines like phoenix chick ointment to promote healing and closure. For those with deficiency, take supplements, and the healing can be completed in half a month.</p>
<p>For external hemorrhoids, use a disinfecting powder for washing, and apply the dried hemorrhoid powder as for internal hemorrhoids, with no differences from start to finish. Completion is auspicious after a hundred days before resuming marital relations. As for chronic and severe bleeding conditions, take Hu Lian’s poison-chasing pills and Huang Lian’s stop-bleeding pills without resorting to needles or thread; the effectiveness is as simple as picking up a grain of millet.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>At the initial stage, it resembles milk, non-swollen and not red, without burning or pain; if walking does not feel anything, it is mild. When it has developed, it becomes swollen and painful, sometimes triggered by exertion, either soft or hard; if there is a discharge of yellow fluid, it is mild. If it lasts long and resembles a chicken comb, bee hive, lotus flower, or flowering plants, with persistent pus and blood, it is severe. If there is leakage from the buttocks and legs, with pus and water dripping, and continuous pain, with feces coming out from the opening, it is critical.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods:</strong></p>
<p>For conditions in their initial or developed stage, gradually increasing and causing difficulty and pain, it is advisable to moisten dryness and nourish yin. If there is a feeling of heaviness in the anus, blood in stools, occasional pain, and hardness, it is appropriate to clear fire and dampness. For purple swelling and pain with constipation, accompanied by itching, cool the blood, dispel wind, and promote the resolution of damp-heat. For swelling and hardness with a feeling of heaviness and stabbing pain, making bowel movements difficult, external fumigation and washing are recommended, and internal clearing is necessary. For internal hemorrhoids with blood loss, and difficulty in retracting while using the toilet, it is important to strengthen the spleen and elevate the central qi. For blood before and after bowel movements, with a pale-yellow complexion, heart palpitations, and tinnitus, one should nourish the blood and strengthen the spleen. To eradicate hemorrhoids at their root, it is essential to use desiccating medicines to complete the orifice, and one must avoid excessive sexual activity for recovery.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>On Buttock Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Buttock abscesses arise in the lower abdomen, positioned deep and remote, where the qi and blood rarely flow. They are caused by damp heat pooling and stagnating, which leads to their formation. It is essential for them to manifest externally, so as not to cause internal injury. When they first appear and the poison accumulates from the five organs, there will be identifiable symptoms: the area will feel heavy and dragging, like a stone; internally, there will be dryness and heat in the mouth. One should take internal remedies to dissipate the heat, like &quot;Snow Melting Decoction,&quot; to clear accumulated heat. Externally, apply an ointment to the edges of the wound and use the golden yellow powder to draw out the pus and dark blood, while also taking medicinal herbs for self-healing.</p>
<p>If one takes internal remedies that dispel poison and cold, and applies cooling drugs externally, it can cause the qi and blood to solidify. This prevents the toxic qi from emerging, and instead, will lead to internal injury. If the wound&#39;s edges are soft and sunken without pus, the root is flat and dispersed without pain, and there are internal symptoms of heat, dry mouth, irritability, speaking incoherently, wheezing, and rough breathing—these indicate a poor prognosis. Most cases arise from accumulated poison within, manifesting outwardly; this happens in 80-90% of cases. Only 1-2% result from external influences like wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness penetrating inward. Should there be a recurrence of symptoms returning internally, it will lead to certain death.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>In the initial stage, if there is a head that is red, swollen, and painful, high with heat, and with a prominent root, it is easy to treat. Once it develops, if it has been inflamed with swelling and pain, and at times the skin appears thin and shiny, red, and prone to pus, it is manageable. If it has already ruptured, with thick yellow pus resembling pig&#39;s brain, and the swelling subsides with pain relief, allowing for ease of movement, it is easy to handle. </p>
<p>In the preliminary stage, if it appears like millet, or with a small yellow blister that is flat and itchy, and the root is dispersed, it is serious. Once fully developed, if it is purple, hard, with swelling in the buttocks and thighs, accompanied by difficulty in urination, and with no pus after a long duration, it is dangerous. After it has burst, if there is no thick pus, the top is hollow and the root is soft and collapsed, with no sensation of pain upon pressing, and a confused spirit, there is no treatment method.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>At first, there is a feeling of intense cold and body fatigue, a desire to cover oneself with clothing and bedding, and the pulse is floating and tight at the surface; one should disperse it slightly. Once the condition has developed, there is internal heat, dry mouth, a craving for cold drinks, a slight amount of urine, and constipation; one should promote bowel movement. If there is a high forehead, red complexion, painful heat, intermittent pain, one should use herbal formulas to relieve heat and detoxify. If there is swelling that is already high and causes pain, and the pus is mature but has not ruptured, causing intolerable distension and pain, one should promptly use acupuncture. After it has ruptured, if it remains hard and does not heal, with persistent pus and watery discharge, and food loses its taste, one should reinforce and strengthen the spleen.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>The large intestine and lungs are interrelated; when there is heat in the lungs, the large intestine becomes dry and constipated. When the lungs are weak, the large intestine may prolapse. This is its essence. Thus, there are cases where prolonged diarrhea or dysentery leads to prolapse due to depletion of qi in the spleen and kidneys. There are also cases caused by coldness and deficiency of central qi, unable to contain and resulting in prolapse. Some may be due to labor and vomiting or diarrhea, harming the liver and spleen, leading to prolapse. Others may stem from dampness from alcohol harming the spleen and sexual desires affecting the kidneys, leading to prolapse. There are cases where kidney qi is fundamentally weak, and the &quot;gate&quot; is not secure, resulting in prolapse. Some may be due to excessive use of cold and coolness, leading to excessive downward movement and loss of yang, causing prolapse. Damp-heat may also cause downward pressure and result in prolapse. However, if there is heat, there must be heat symptoms; if none, it indicates deficiency. Furthermore, qi deficiency is equivalent to yang deficiency; simply using warming supplements may not yield results. This condition is often seen in children with insufficient vital energy. Hence, Chen Ziming remarked: In cases of large intestine deficiency and cold, if qi descends, the anus may protrude. This can also occur from the effort during childbirth. This is a true observation concerning diagnosis. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong><a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: For those with prolapse, elevate them. Xu Zhi&#39;s commentary says: &quot;Treatable prolapse can be remedied.&quot; This refers to methods for treating hemorrhoids. Therefore, ancient practitioners often used herbs like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, myrrh, ligusticum, licorice, and buchu to replenish and support the affected areas; sometimes they combined these with northern herbs like five-flavored fruit and wumei to strengthen and solidify the prolapse. Additionally, external remedies for fumigation and washing to manage prolapse will invariably lead to recovery.</p>
<p>For those with a slight deficiency of vital energy leading to prolapse, it is advisable to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction or Five-flavored Dispersal. If there is internal cold with vomiting and diarrhea leading to prolapse, the Five Gentlemen Decoction or Warm Stomach Drink should be used. In cases of persistent diarrhea and slippery prolapse, Stomach Barrier Decoction or additives like wumei, northern five-flavored fruit, clam, and myrrh may be used. If the spleen is deficient and prolapsing, the Supplementing Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction or Lifting Yuan Decoction is prudent. If kidney and liver deficiencies are present with prolapse, a Yin-Supplementing and Qi-Benefiting Decoction is recommended. </p>
<p>If there is a combination of Yin deficiency and Yang deficiency leading to prolapse, a Regulating Yin Decoction or Great Supplementing Yuan Decoction is appropriate. In all the conditions discussed, if there is a deficiency with accompanying heat, redness, or swelling and pain, the Supplementing Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction should be augmented with herbs like huanglian, huangqin, and sophora flower, with modifications as necessary. It is essential to confirm the presence of a true fire condition before applying cold remedies. If it is not true fire, one must avoid bitter and cold treatments to prevent further sinking and damage to the spleen.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Collective Library of Ancient and Modern Literature, Medical Section, Volume 208</strong></p>

<p>Each of the two ingredients, Curcuma and Bletilla, is one tael, and one recipe adds Huanglian.</p>
<p>For the two right ingredients, grind them into a fine powder. If it&#39;s an internal hemorrhoid, wait until sitting on the toilet causes it to protrude, wash well with warm water, lie on the side and it will come out. Use honey water to prepare the mixture well, apply it around the good tissue with a brush, keeping the hemorrhoid outside. Cover the medicine with paper, wait a while, then use the withering medicine to apply on the hemorrhoid, dipping the brush in warm water on the paper to prevent the medicine from drying out or dispersing.</p>
<p>Withering hemorrhoid formula:<br>Four taels of alum, two and a half qian of fresh leadstone, and one qian of cinnabar, ground to an extremely fine powder.

<p>With the alum ground to an extremely fine powder, assess the size of the hemorrhoid, taking some alum powder in your palm, adding a little cinnabar and mixing with saliva to achieve a thin consistency. Use the brush to apply the mixture thoroughly over the hemorrhoid three times a day, monitoring for the hemorrhoid&#39;s color to turn dark black as a sign of effectiveness. If yellow fluid emerges by night, do not doubt it; when it is gone, that is excellent. By midnight, apply the medicine once more, continuing the same the next day. Apply the medicine three times even if there is slight pain as that is not a concern.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>When changing the medicine, use a bowl to hold new water or warm soup, and lightly wash the old medicine off the hemorrhoids with a brush, then apply the new medicine, while still using the protective ointment. Next, rinse with a Jingjie decoction. After two to three days, when the yellow fluid is about to run out, increase the realgar in the medicine and decrease the alum, which will slow down its potency. Increase or decrease gradually over the next two or three days, taking care to observe any changes in the color of the hemorrhoids, adjusting the thickness and application of the medicine accordingly, as this is the way to handle it effectively. This medicine primarily relies on arsenic for its effect, and the addition of realgar helps resolve it.

Adding two old yellow eggplants to the formula yields even better results.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Method for Preparing Medicinal Line at the Recluse’s Chamber</strong></p>
<p>To treat external hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, glandular carbuncles, and perianal abscesses: Take root of the plant <em>yuanhua</em> (Daphne) in any quantity, crush to extract the natural juice. In a bronze cauldron, simmer over low heat until it forms a thick paste. Introduce raw silk thread into the paste, continue to simmer for a long time until the paste thickens adequately. Allow the thread to dry and reserve the paste for future use.</p>
<p>For treating external hemorrhoids with a protrusion, tie the medicinal thread around it and wait for the hemorrhoid to blacken and fall off. Then use the thread wrapped around a pig&#39;s bristle dipped in medicine to insert into the opening, ensuring it does not recur.</p>
<p>For rectal prolapse and the three types of abscesses, regardless of the number of wound openings, select the one nearest the anus. Use <em>malian grass</em> to probe the opening; if a passage leads to the intestine, first take a silver bar bent into shape to gently probe the anal canal, retrieving the grass hook. Prepare a thread about six or seven inches long, making a live loop at one end. Do not knot the thread but instead connect it to the grass, leading it through the large intestine. Then pass the free end of the thread through the loop, allowing it to extend an inch outside, attaching a lead weight of around three or four or five grams to the free end, allowing it to hang freely. This method makes sitting and lying down convenient without sticking to clothing, ensuring quick results.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>Every morning, wash the thread clean, and when it has lengthened by about five minutes, it must be collected, leaving only one inch of thread. After seven days, if the thread is three inches below, attend to the areas needing to be filled; if the source is already blocked and there are no holes left unthreaded, and the three sores (abscesses) have no pus, everything can be properly settled. For sores near the anus, after ten days to half a month, the thread will pass through the anus and drop. For sores farther away, it will drop after twenty days. If after seven days and the thread has dropped, nearby sores are still wet, it means the intestine is torn, not just at one point, and further sewing is still required. If unable to sew, use a paper twist dipped in powder to apply to the sore until it hurts and bends, doing this three or two times until it opens up for threading. Once the thread has fallen, use a flesh-repairing powder. The silver strip should be double-folded, about three inches long, shaped like an elongated “又”.

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The “Lingshu” states: For heat diseases accompanied by head pain, temporal headache, painful arteries, and good bleeding; these are symptoms of a heat disease. Use the third needle to assess excess or deficiency, warmth or cold hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>The “Jia Yi Jing” states: For hemorrhoid pain, the point at the middle of the bamboo (zan zhu) is the main point; also, the perineum is a major point. Any hemorrhoid that connects with the yin is fatal. </p>
<p>For various ailments in the yin, if there is pain that draws between front and back, and if one cannot pass urine or stool, all are targeted.</p>
<p>For bone erosion due to hemorrhoids, the point at Shangqiu is major.</p>
<p>For hemorrhoid-related pain, the points Feiyang, Weizhong, and Chengfu are the main targets.</p>
<p>For cramping pain from hemorrhoids, the point Chengjin is the primary point.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>Prolapse and diarrhea are governed by Qi.</p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: Feiyang is for the pain from hemorrhoidal injuries. Juegu is for the swelling near anal fistulas.</p>
<p>Tiantu, Zhangmen, Tianchi, and Zhigou govern leakage.</p>
<p>Shangqiu and Fuliu govern post-hemorrhoid blood loss.</p>
<p>Laogong governs hot hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Chengjin, Chengfu, Weizhong, and Yanggu govern hemorrhoidal pain and swelling under the armpit. For long-standing cold-induced hemorrhoids, moxibustion on the back at specific points is recommended.</p>
<p>For hemorrhoidal bleeding with fecal loss, moxibustion at the Huiqi point is beneficial. The acupoint is above the spine at the end of the bones. For illnesses caused by cold leading to prolapse, moxibustion at the navel should be done annually.</p>
<p>If prolapse does not heal over the years, apply moxibustion at the horizontal bones several times, and then at the tailbone as well. The tailbone refers to the last bone of the spine.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers&quot; states: When toxins in the organs initially cause slight swelling, use wet earthworm feces shaped like coins and apply them to the affected area, burning moxa the size of half a bean until it is slightly warm, then remove it. Replace with a new application and repeat as before, for a total of fourteen applications, and use ice fragrance powder for rubbing.</p>
<p>For those with a deficiency, prolapse can occur. Indeed, before the winter solstice, the heavenly forces are extremely cold and heavy, corresponding with the human body, which is a small cosmos: heaven above, humans in the middle, and earth below. Should not the effects be congruent? Treatment may not yield immediate results. As Yang increases after the solstice, and daytime lengthens, Yang gradually grows and Yin diminishes. Moxibustion should be used as treatment; it will be effective for all. Patients should also avoid excessive labor and maintain a calm disposition for the best results.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>Select a clear and warm auspicious day, sit or lie in a well-ventilated and warm room. Take the top of the head, specifically the Baihui point, and apply some sauce with a spatula, then perform moxibustion three times. Meanwhile, take Shengyuan Da Bu Tang; this will gradually tighten the anus. The Baihui point is a crucial junction in the body that can greatly lift the sinking energy, hence its efficacy. Do not perform moxibustion before the Winter Solstice, as it would be of no benefit. The next day, apply moxibustion on the coccyx and around the navel, adjusting according to the year&#39;s vigor. This method has proven very effective for me, and it also treats various forms of hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>As mentioned in &quot;Danxi&#39;s Heart Method,&quot; for hemorrhoids, first take some scabs from the head, mold them into a small cake, place it on the hemorrhoid, and then put a slice of garlic on top, applying moxibustion. For hemorrhoid pain, mix aconite powder with saliva to create a cake the size of a coin, place it on the hemorrhoid, and perform moxibustion until it is slightly warm. If it dries, replace it with a new cake and moxibustion again the next day, continuing until the tissue becomes level.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: For rectal prolapse, select points from the large intestine meridian: Baihui, Changqiang, Jianjing, Hegu, and Qichong. </p>
<p>For acupuncture in cases of hemorrhoids, focus solely on the foot Taiyang meridian. The classic mentions: diseases arising from the foot Taiyang meridian include hemorrhoids, malaria, and conditions of excess or deficiency, heat or cold, which descend. This is why later generations also selected the Chengshan point. </p>
<p>There are also discussions on the Du meridian, although its treatment methods are not mentioned. The classic states: diseases arising from the Du meridian can include urinary retention and hemorrhoids. Hence, later generations selected the Changqiang point as well. </p>
<p>In cases of hemorrhoids with anal bleeding, urgency, heaviness, or either itching or pain, locate Erbai four inches above the transverse crease on the palm along the hand Jueyin meridian. One point is positioned between two tendons and the other outside the larger tendon; insert the needle three-tenths of an inch, with two calming and three invigorating techniques. </p>
<p>Another method for significant pain: apply the needle at Changqiang one inch deep to the acupoint, with a cycle of three calming and three invigorating techniques. Moxibustion can be applied up to seven times; even if the condition has persisted for a long time, it may still be effective.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>Another method: Take two and a half inches from the承山 point, and supplement with one inhalation; apply seven moxibustions like a cauterization. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: The Mingmen point is situated in the spine, opposite the navel; moxibustion of seven times treats five types of hemorrhoids. Another method: The Changqiang point is located above the tailbone; moxibustion should be applied according to the years and it is most effective for bleeding from five types of hemorrhoids. Another method: For hemorrhoids as large as a cucumber, pass through the lower intestines causing stiff paralysis; wash with schizonepeta decoction, then apply moxibustion above three to five times. If a hot sensation enters the intestines and causes a sudden discharge of bright red blood along with pain, after a while the condition will recover. Another method: For newly onset hemorrhoids with incessant pain and itching, heat the sole of an old cloth shoe and frequently press it on the painful and itchy areas. Reheat and press again if it cools; this will immediately relieve the pain and itching. For prolapse of the rectum: moxibustion of the Changqiang point three times will cure it; at the navel, according to the years. The Baihui point is located at the top center of the head; moxibustion three times treats children&#39;s rectal prolapse.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br><strong>Guide to Healing</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states: Hemorrhoids occur due to a downward fall of qi and blood, leading to conflicts that cause hemorrhoids. This condition prevents one from sitting or standing, but can be cured by the method of guided movement. The approach is to lie with the head elevated, calm the heart, and regulate the qi; when the qi stabilizes, the swelling will naturally recede.</p>
<p>Another method involves: embracing the feet with both hands, keeping the head still while the feet receive qi towards the mouth, causing the energy at various joints to disperse. One should try to grasp the energy while turning the body sideways, applying pressure on the waist, without moving the limbs. This can alleviate the stagnation of qi and blood in the lower body, relieving the cold blood inside the marrow and the tension that leads to hemorrhoidal swelling and pain.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a method: with the feet together, pressing and kicking towards the lower body, using both hands to hold the knees. Apply pressure quickly and effectively in both directions, followed by moving the waist forward and backward to relieve the stress on the heart and treat hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Another approach involves: sitting with knees together and spreading the feet, maintaining the breathing open, which treats five types of hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Another technique: with one foot on the ground and the other bent at the knee, holding onto the lower legs with both hands and applying strong pressure towards the body, alternating sides four times. This helps alleviate hemorrhoids and relieves the burden on the lower qi.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: The method for guiding hemorrhoids involves the area between the coccyx and sacrum, specifically at the Changqiang point. Dig at a 64-degree angle and rub as needed, while also employing the suction and exhaling technique for self-comfort.</p>
<p>Movement exercise: Sit down with regular breathing, focus your thoughts on the afflicted area, inhale the four turbidities through nine orifices, then consolidate the energy and direct it to the coccyx, performing this for a hundred repetitions. After that, elevate the energy through the waist and perform the exercise in a count of twenty-seven; engage in daily practice without interruption to naturally eliminate the root of the problem.</p>
<p>For the guiding method for anal seepage: Visualize the afflicted area and disperse the energy, then use both hands to embrace both knees, inhaling and exhaling. </p>
<p>Another method: disperse the energy through blowing six times, rotating the skin around the afflicted area, imagining a fiery burn, and then allow the spring water to rise and flow into the lung meridian, dispersing the energy.</p>
<p>Back consolidation method: Sit quietly for a while, clear your mind of all thoughts, focus your spirit and determination on the main point, within the cavity of the back, in a tranquil and empty state. Initially, recite &quot;Taiyi saves the distressed&quot; from your mouth, gradually returning the focus to your heart and back, maintaining awareness of both the void and the existence, lingering in the present, and fusing hidden with the non-existent; the spirit becomes empty and thus is able to resonate.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book on Sores&quot; states: A person suffered from hemorrhoids and consumed half a liter of sea snails daily. Due to their salty nature, he rinsed his mouth with bitter tea and consumed up to a dou (approximately 10 liters). He was also able to maintain a calm mind and desire, and thus the hemorrhoids disappeared. Hemorrhoids are associated with the body&#39;s internal heat (yang), while sea snails are cold in nature and salty, fitting the yin. Cold can counteract heat, and salt can soften hardness; bitter tea, being cool, contributes to this logic.</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Teachings on Caring for Parents&quot; mentions: Mr. Zhao Yu frequently suffered from hemorrhoids and used various remedies such as phoenix-eye grass, hedgehog skin, locust roots, and raccoon tails. Some suggested using dried ginger powder, applied to roasted pork for consumption, but this led to dry and hardened stools, causing discomfort and swelling. After several days, he developed jaundice due to the illness. I treated him with several bouts of induced diarrhea, without mentioning the hemorrhoids; Dr. Ma casually noted this down. After Mr. Yu became acquainted with the person who applied the remedy, he did not suffer from hemorrhoids again.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: After childbirth, Xu&#39;s woman developed hemorrhoids, with the sores having a head the size of a garlic bulb, sometimes discharging fresh or dark blood, and accompanied by painful bowel movements. This is due to excessive consumption of meat, indicating dampness and heat in the large intestine. Mix 7 qian each of wood-fragrant plum kernel, hemp seed, and sophora flower, and 5 qian each of bitter orange and soap pod; then mix 3 qian each of costus, angelica tail, and raw rehmannia, and 1 qian of stir-fried rhubarb. Divide into six doses, grinding the three kernels separately, and decoct for consumption to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: A woman with rectal prolapse washed the anus with a thick decoction of glutinous rice, then heated a brick until red, soaked it in vinegar, laid a blue cloth over it to keep it warm, and sat on it, causing the anus to retract on its own.</p>
<p>Wang Wenxian from Xiangzhou during the Tang Dynasty served as an official in the Western Route Pacification Office. He rode a mule into Luogu and developed hemorrhoids, which appeared like a gourd and obstructed the intestinal opening, feeling like intense heat from burning ash. He collapsed when he reached the post station. The head of the post station said: &quot;I have suffered from this illness before; one must apply moxibustion to heal it.&quot; He used a strong decoction of willow branches to first wash the hemorrhoids, then applied moxa sticks on top and performed moxibustion for three to five sessions. Suddenly, he felt a warm sensation enter his intestines, followed by a violent discharge of fresh blood and feces, causing extreme pain. After the diarrhea, he no longer felt the presence of the gourd and rode away on the mule.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br>&quot;The Medical Cases of the Xue Family&quot; says: One person, through carelessness in drinking and indulgence, suffered from hemorrhoids with swelling, pain at the anus, blood in the stool, and dry bowel movements. The pulse was large and rapid. Using a decoction of Angelica (Mu Yu) and peach kernels, he improved slightly after four doses. Then, with Si Wu Decoction, plus safflower, peach kernels, Radix Scutellariae, and Sophora flower, he was cured after several doses.</p>
<p>Another person had a chronic case of hemorrhoids; after labor, he suffered from rectal prolapse, swelling, pain, and discharge of pus, with qi deficiency. He took the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with Poria and Peony for over ten doses, restoring his qi and achieving recovery. Later, he had a recurrence with pain, mistakenly took Da Huang pills, leading to abdominal rumbling and aversion to food, nearly putting him in danger. I used the previous decoction with roasted ginger and peony, and he gradually recovered, later replacing ginger with cooked Rehmannia and Schisandra, achieving recovery after over thirty doses.</p>
<p>One individual had a weak spleen and stomach, whether from labor or sexual activity. The anus would descend, with severe swelling and pain. He used the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction, adding Ophiopogon and Schisandra along with Liu Wei pills for recovery. However, after excessive drinking, he experienced descent, swelling, and pain, with symptoms of heat and toxicity. I administered the previous decoction with roasted ginger and Mu Xiang for one dose, then continued with the original decoction, adjusting and adding the Eight Flavor pills; he achieved stability after two months.</p>
<p>A man suffering from hemorrhoids experienced dry and hard stools, pain at the anus, and thirst, with a rapid pulse and a hard abdomen upon palpation. Using the Qin Jiao and Cang Zhu decoction for two doses provided slight relief, followed by a Si Wu Decoction with Scutellaria, Lian Qiao, Sophora flower, and bitter orange, leading to recovery after four doses.</p>
<p>One person developed a leakage from hemorrhoids; each time he used the toilet, he felt pain. With Qin Jiao and Fang Feng decoction and added Radix Scutellariae and bitter orange, he recovered. Adding the Si Wu Decoction with Cimicifuga, Scutellaria, Lian Qiao, and JIng Jie, there was no recurrence.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br>A man suffering from hemorrhoids experienced pain and protrusion from the anus every time he used the toilet, which would take a long time to recover. After taking several doses of Qin Jiao and Fang Feng Decoction, he felt slightly better. He then added Da Huang along with Huang Qi, Chuan Xiong, and Shao Yao, which halted the pain. After taking over twenty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, he no longer had any protrusion.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from hemorrhoids that were swollen and painful. After taking four doses of Si Wu Decoction with added Qian, Lian, Hong Hua, Tao Ren, and Mu Dan Pi, her pain lessened, and she eventually recovered after a few more doses.</p>
<p>Another woman who had long been afflicted with hemorrhoids would bleed a few drops during heat. She was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus Huang Lian, which cured her. Later, due to excessive strain, she experienced swelling and pain along with continuous menstruation; her pulse was strong but lacked force when pressed. This was due to damage to her blood and qi from overexertion. She was treated with Ba Zhen Decoction plus Qian, Lian, and Pu Huang for two doses, after which her symptoms ceased. Following this, Pu Huang, Qian, and Lian were removed, and Di Gu Pi was added for several doses until she felt stable.</p>
<p>Dan Xi stated that for women suffering from menorrhagia, it is due to damage to the internal organs, causing deficiency in the Chong and Ren meridians. The two meridians are considered the sea of the channels, governing the flow of blood and qi, circulating externally through the meridians and internally nourishing the organs. When qi and blood are balanced, menstruation occurs regularly. However, if one overworks, it can damage the organs and lead to a deficiency in the qi of the Chong and Ren meridians, resulting in sudden menorrhagia, referred to as “sudden flooding.” Treatment should focus on greatly replenishing qi and blood while nourishing the spleen and stomach. A slight addition of remedies to calm and settle heart fire may help the heart, allowing the cycle to normalize.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br>A man suffered from hemorrhoids, and every time he went to the toilet, he experienced prolapse for a long time before it returned. His pulse was thin and weak. After administering over thirty doses of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, he no longer had any issues. Danxi said: Prolapse belongs to qi heat, qi deficiency, blood heat, and blood deficiency.</p>
<p>Another man had a condition with discharge from his buttocks, experienced dry mouth and fever, preferred purulent but thin discharge, and had a slow pulse. He was treated with moxibustion on fermented soybean cakes and took the Ba Zhen Decoction with additions of Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Soft Chai Hu, and Di Gu Pi. After more than three months, he recovered. Subsequently, due to carelessness in sexual activity, the condition relapsed, with purulent discharge and a strong pulse. He declined treatment and eventually died. Hejian remarked: If illness leads to deficiency, it is considered light; this is because the illness is still mild and the vital energy is not yet depleted. However, if one overexerts themselves after initial recovery—whether through diet, labor, or sexual activities, leading to depletion—this deficiency becomes severe. The illness has progressed, and the vital energy has already been consumed.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>A man suffered from hemorrhoids, which were swollen and painful, with severe rectal bleeding. His pulse was strong and thin. The text states: If one overeats, the meridians get obstructed and the intestines becomes inflamed, leading to hemorrhoids. This is because wind affects the liver; the liver generates wind, which in turn produces heat. When wind invades, it harms the essence and results in this disease. Therefore, he was treated with a combination of Huanglian (Coptis), Danggui (Angelica Sinensis), Huangqi (Astragalus), Shengdihuang (Rehmannia), Fangfeng (Siler), Zhihua (Bitter Orange Peel), Baizhi (Angelica Dahurica), Chaihu (Bupleurum), Huaihua (Sophora Flower), Diyi (Earth Center), and Gancao (Licorice) to which he gradually improved; subsequently, he took Huanglian pills and was cured. </p>

He was treated with Bazhentang (Eight Treasure Decoction), adding Huangqi, Chaihu, and Digupi, which provided slight relief. However, desiring immediate effect, he used harsh medications to exacerbate the condition, resulting in severe pain and leading to his death from refusing food. The ulcer&#39;s healing depends on the flow of qi and blood. A floating and bounding pulse with afternoon pain indicates deficiency of qi and blood. Danxi states: If the wound does not close, use large doses of ginseng, astragalus, poria, angelica, and chuanxiong to replenish it; externally, apply canned aconite and moxibustion, further supplemented with medicated plasters.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>A man over forty had hemorrhoids, with loose bowel movements; after taking Wuling Powder, his condition worsened, and he had little appetite. I suggested he was not suffering from damp toxin, but rather a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and recommended the Lizhong Decoction. He disagreed, continued with Wuling Powder, and became worse. After further consultation, I prescribed Lizhong Decoction and Ershen Pill for over a month, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Li Kui was weakened by his hemorrhoids, so I modified the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, adding a bit of Qiang Huo, Lian Qiao, and Zhi Ke for his treatment, and he improved slightly. Later, he became exceedingly angry during late winter; his pulse was forceful and large. I noted that the pulse did not respond properly to the season, indicating insufficient kidney water with fire overpowering it. Medication could not treat this, and he ultimately died in the month of excessive fire. I often see that those suffering from hemorrhoids exhibit insufficient kidney pulse, making them difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Liu Shang had hemorrhoids with prolapse. This was due to damp heat descending, preventing genuine qi from ascending. Upon examining his pulse, it was indeed weak. I then prescribed Si Junzi Decoction with added Huang Qi, Xiong, Gui, Cang Zhu, Huang Bo, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu, along with a decoction of Wubeizi for topical fumigation. He thought it was a gradual improvement but resorted to caustic poisons like arsenic to eat away at it, which ultimately led to his demise. Medications that specifically target external symptoms can harm one&#39;s true essence and are often detrimental. Be very cautious!<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>A man suffered from hemorrhoids, and as his qi and blood grew weak, he lost appetite and had difficulty controlling his urination, sometimes experiencing nocturnal emissions. This was due to a deficiency of qi combined with damp heat, not an ulcer. He was treated with Si Jun Zi Tang, supplemented with Shan Zhu Yu, Shan Yao, and Wu Wei Zi, along with a little Dan Huang, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had hemorrhoids with pus and bloody stool. Various medications were ineffective. His pulse was quite strong, so I instructed him to take one pig kidney, cut it open, mix in five grams of black Qian Niu Zi powder, tie it up with thread, and steam it wrapped in lotus leaves until cooked. He was to chew it thoroughly and swallow it with warm salty wine several times, which led to immediate improvement; further supportive treatments were continued until he fully recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a man had hemorrhoids and a dry mouth, with weak stomach pulses. This was due to insufficient middle qi and a deficiency of fluids, preventing upward nourishment. He was treated with Huang Qi Liu Yi Tang and Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. Some said that pains and itchiness from sores were all due to heart fire. They then took bitter cold medications, causing extreme diarrhea and leading to death. It is understood that all pains and itchiness relate to heart fire, which is its normal expression. If heat appears at first and cold ends, that is contrary to the norm, but can one conflate these and remain unaware?</p>
<p>A man had a festering sore on his buttocks that had necrosed, with no new muscle growth. Upon applying medicinal ointments, the surrounding area became hard. Upon examination, his pulse was thin and weak, indicating that his qi and blood were insufficient to nourish the affected area. Thus, the application of cooling herbs caused the area to harden, resulting from qi and blood being congealed by cold rather than any toxicity. He was treated with strong nourishing medication and recovered.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br>A man with a buttock abscess experienced swelling, hardness, and pain; his pulse was floating and tight, and pressure revealed weakness. A dose of Qianghuo Decoction was given, which stopped the pain; followed by four doses of honeysuckle powder, leading to the pus resolving and recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a severely painful buttock abscess. Moxibustion with garlic was performed, and he took two doses of Xianfang Huanming Decoction, which alleviated the pain and reduced the swelling; then, with the addition of Huangbo and Cangzhu to the Tori Xiaodu San, the pus resolved and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man with a painful buttock abscess that had started to produce pus took two doses of Xianfang Huanming Decoction, which stopped the pain. He was then given Tori Xiaodu San, resulting in the pus resolving and healing.</p>
<p>A man with a buttock abscess that did not produce pus, who had poor appetite and little thought, was first treated with Liujunzitang, adding Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Huangqi. His appetite gradually improved, and he was later given Tori Xiaodu San, leading to the pus resolving and recovery.</p>
<p>A man with a buttock abscess that broke and had clear pus that did not resolve was treated with moxibustion using fermented soybeans. He also took Shiquan Dabu Decoction for over two months and recovered. Abscesses that do not produce pus, or do not resolve, or produce pus that does not close up, are generally due to deficiency of qi and blood. If the pus is clear and thin, it indicates significant deficiency.</p>
<p>A man with a buttock abscess had continuous pus drainage and gradually lost muscle mass, with poor appetite and little thought. His stomach pulse was slightly wiry. He was treated with several doses of Liujunzitang, adding Huoxiang and Angelica, leading to improvement in his appetite. Treatment with Shiquan Dabu Decoction and moxibustion with fermented soybeans for over two months resulted in healing.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br>A weak person had an abscess on the buttocks that filled with pus without bursting. After several doses of the Fifteen Complete Nourishing Decoction, it began to rise; then I used acupuncture, and after more than twenty treatments, he was cured. The buttocks are in a secluded position, with little flow of qi and blood. For the elderly and weak, it is essential to tonify qi and blood to ensure recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen buttock, with no change in color, pulse slippery and rapid yet weak; this was an abscess on the buttock with pus likely to form, still internal. I wanted to treat it with external medicines, waiting for the pus to come out before using acupuncture. However, he wished for internal dispersal and took draining medicines, which only worsened his weakness. When he sought treatment again, I returned to the previous method of expelling the pus and used acupuncture, supplemented with tonifying medicines, leading to his recovery. For abscesses that have chronic toxicity sealed inside, the only approach is to nourish the qi and blood to facilitate quicker pus formation and removal by acupuncture; internal dispersal methods should not be considered. Once pus is formed, it is important to differentiate its depth and maturity before acupuncture. If pressing down causes significant pain, the pus is deep; if it causes pain with slight pressure, the pus is shallow; if pressing does not cause much pain, pus has not yet formed; if pressing causes it to rise again, there is pus; if not, there is no pus. If the swelling is high and soft, it arises from blood and vessels; if it is firm and lower, it arises from tendons and bones; if the flesh color remains unchanged, it arises from bone marrow.</p>
<p>Governor Chen Hefeng had a weak spleen and stomach. After taking dispersing and guiding medicines, he developed swelling in his left thigh and buttock. This was due to deficiency of spleen qi causing descent, not an abscess or toxicity. The appropriate remedy would be to excessively augment the qi with Bai Zhu. Confused by popular opinions claiming Bai Zhu can burst pus, he focused solely on dispersing and detoxifying, which exacerbated the swelling and increased his fatigue. I used only Bai Zhu decoction, and it resolved.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br>A scholar named Yang Qiyuan suffered from a carbuncle on his left hip. He applied a cooling medicine, but the swelling spread deep into his inner thigh. After taking a detoxifying powder made of forsythia, he experienced pain throughout his left side. I believed it to be due to a deficiency in the three yin channels, so I prescribed a strengthening formula to tonify the spleen and lungs, along with a six-ingredient pill with five-flavor fruit to nourish the liver and kidneys. The internal swelling subsided, but the area between the hips developed an ulcer; I then used a comprehensive tonic formula, and the wound began to heal.</p>
<p>Another scholar had a carbuncle on his hip, with severe swelling and pain. This was caused by a pathogenic toxin. I used a medicinal drink known for life renewal with garlic moxibustion to help disperse it. However, due to subsequent dietary strain and fatigue, the swelling and pain recurred, accompanied by chills and headaches, indicating a deficiency of vital qi that had not yet recovered. I prescribed the same tonic formula and frequently employed a scallion compress method. After two months, he was healed.</p>
<p>A man had a carbuncle on his hip, characterized by diffuse swelling and unchanged color. His pulse was slippery and rapid but without strength, indicating an impending formation of pus. I intended to incise it but he was afraid of needles and preferred internal treatment. I mistakenly administered aggressive remedies, which suddenly caused symptoms like severe chills, fever, and spontaneous sweating. I then prescribed the comprehensive tonic formula, and after several doses, the swelling became red and still responded to external needling while continuing to tonify internally, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Wu Fuzhi&#39;s father suffered from a carbuncle on his hip with internal ulceration and swelling, fever, dry mouth, and reduced appetite, indicating weakness of the spleen and stomach. Initially, I used a modified six-herb formula with added Chuanxiong, angelica, ginseng, and astragalus for several doses until it ulcerated. I then prescribed the comprehensive tonic formula, increasing the ginseng and astragalus significantly, and after more than fifty doses, he recovered.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>A man of thirty presented with a pulse resembling a leaking roof with sparrows pecking, accompanied by a hard swelling on the buttocks, a sallow complexion, and clear, thin pus. After administering a remedy to dispel toxicity, I observed that the patient was suffering from significant depletion of the three Yin, exacerbated by the medication. I used a formula of Six Gentlemen combined with a penny of Rehmannia, Astragalus, and Aconite, which led to the swelling softening and the color improving. After reducing the Aconite by half a penny, with several doses, his vitality was restored, and the wound healed.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a hard and painful buttock abscess with a feverish sensation. This indicated a deficiency of Bladder Qi and accumulation of damp heat. I administered Qiang Huo Decoction, with two doses leading to a complete remission of the heat and pain; subsequently, I used a formula to clear toxins, which resulted in the abscess draining; I continued with this formula for over forty doses until it healed.</p>
<p>Yuan Shangshe from Pinghu suffered from hemorrhoids, applying cooling ointment externally and taking detoxifying medicine internally. The issue resolved in the buttocks, producing clear and thin pus, while the pulse was large and rapid, with alternating chills and fever leading to thirst. I declined to treat him, leading to his eventual demise. This indicated a depletion of the three Yin, resulting in a loss of the source of transformation, causing the genuine Qi to become increasingly feeble, which inevitably led to death.</p>
<p>Zhou Xifu, a successful graduate, had a history of hernias and hemorrhoids. He experienced lower abdominal pain when fatigued, with white discharge from the penis and swollen, painful hemorrhoids. If he consumed improper foods or exerted himself, he developed internal heat and cold symptoms along with fatigue. He attempted to treat the root of the illness using medications that attack the disease and promote tissue growth, but his physique became emaciated. I prescribed a Qi-enhancing decoction and Rehmannia pills, which gradually restored his vitality, yet he continued to be unable to fully recover due to his excessive relaxation and lack of regulation.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>The &quot;Aesthetic Grass&quot; says: In the past, a neighbor treated Master Zhang Shouxian, who had long suffered from anal fistula and was greatly drained of qi and blood. There was a recommendation for a good surgeon in our hometown, named Huang, who was skilled in cutting. The master trusted this technique and decided to take all internal medicines to remedy the issue. Unworthy Changya valued the master&#39;s literary and moral stature. In the past, while residing in Yinghai, he once sent disciples to take his pulse and inquire privately about good post-treatment strategies. In essence, he conveyed that after a long struggle with leakage, if one suddenly regains balance, the vital energy will flourish internally, and one could live a hundred years free of worries.</p>
<p>However, in a newly established area, there is still the risk of infiltration; if the organs have been long deficient, the intestines are prone to rupture, creating the possibility of transference. If pure energy has long been stagnant and one has already taken sweet and warming foods to elevate their spirit, yet the leakage persists excessively, the dark consumption of yin blood becomes a concern; if food and water are easily mixed, and nourishing the organs to strengthen the intestines has been employed, but if excessive moistening agents are used, the spleen&#39;s energy could easily dissipate, posing a risk to yins. </p>
<p>Furthermore, since the leakage path connects to the essence passage, if essence slightly overflows, it is bound to seep out sideways. Thus, nurturing essence should be like nurturing a tiger; it should be rich in flavor to nourish the spleen. If the flavor is not properly controlled, it will inevitably lead to leakage, resulting in a lack of benefit for yin. Indeed, the body&#39;s spleen energy prefers dryness and dislikes dampness. Once the leakage path is completed, the spoiling filth descends with no exit; it must inevitably seep into the spleen, exacerbating the dampness. Thus, one should supplement the yang of the spleen, without harming the yin of the spleen, to restore the regular functions and reap the benefits of balance.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>When summoned to diagnose in the middle of the month, I lightly touched the pulse and found it strong; pressing harder revealed it to be faint, indicating that the Yang was insufficient while the Yin was severely harmed. Whenever the doctor administered supplements to replenish Yin, the patient would sleep soundly at night, and the intestines would also be loose. This led the ulcer doctor to mistakenly employ the methods of treating intestinal wind and blood loss with sophora and burnet, without realizing the error. In fact, the condition of leakage is a disease of the essence and orifices. When essence is being formed, if Qi is retained, the essence is stopped; if Qi is in motion, the essence leaks. Generally, when one forcefully enters the bedroom, the Qi often surges forth, causing the essence to spill out uncontrollably, flowing through the orifices and frequently overflowing beyond the seminal ducts, eventually forming a leak. Even though the leak may be addressed, the voids within the flesh remain. To fill the orifices and restore the conduits cannot be achieved by such medicinal powers.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br>The unworthy practitioner does not speak of its flaws, but in the case of the patient, they remove things like the branches of locust trees and earthworm root, adding only deer antler frost. It is said that the only thing capable of filling the deficiencies beneath the jade hall is the pearl on the spotted dragon&#39;s head. Furthermore, the medicines for the various yin conditions are particularly effective at nourishing the lower regions. If not fortified, might the fluids in the intestines become prone to excessive pooling? Yet, this is merely a faint hint of what is needed. A wound doctor is unable to understand and thus has deemed it unusable. I recall a practitioner in my hometown who treated leakage; when an ulcer formed, he applied a method with two divine formulas. First, he administered half a pound of pills, causing the vitality to suddenly diminish, allowing the flesh inside the canal to fill and the outside to become firm. Subsequently, he gave another half pound of pills, reviving the vitality again. Although this method may be suitable for the young, it may not be suitable for the old, yet its intention is indeed remarkable. The unworthy one simply aims to fill the channels, but Huang Sheng dissuades them; have they not heard of this person and this method?<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>The &quot;Authentic Text on Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from hemorrhoids for six years. Whenever he engaged in drinking, indulgence, or heavy labor, the hemorrhoids would become swollen, hard, and painful, taking over ten days to improve slightly. He wanted to eliminate the root of the problem, so he applied a desiccating powder for hemorrhoids for up to seven days. Gradually, his hemorrhoids turned black, with cracks appearing on the outside. By the sixteenth day, they dried and fell off, resembling a chicken heart. He then used a muscle-replenishing powder daily and took internal medicine to nourish blood and strengthen the spleen, ultimately recovering.</p>
<p>Another man also suffered from hemorrhoids, which caused swelling and pain, and he had dry, hard bowel movements, with a pulse that was rapid and forceful. He took two doses of an internal formula with Huanglian to relieve pain from bowel movements; then he took several doses of a formula containing Qinhua and Zhiqiao to reduce the swelling. He later took a dose of Zanglian pills, and there was no recurrence.</p>
<p>Yet another man had hemorrhoids that would swell and hurt with any exertion. He underwent a steam wash with Zhiqiao decoction and took an internal concoction of Fangfeng and Qinjiao, reducing the pain and swelling after several doses. He was advised to regularly wash with the decoction five to six times a month and to take Liuwei Dihuang pills, adding Huangbo and Zhimu; he did not experience a recurrence.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br>A man enjoyed drinking and had excessive desires, suffering from internal hemorrhoids with blood loss. After taking a decoction of four substances with added herbs—Scutellaria, Lian, Ephedra, and Pueraria—he took it for several doses, and the symptoms subsided. He also took two doses of a decoction with Angelica (and Jujube) and the swelling of the hemorrhoids decreased. Additionally, he took Zanglian pills for over a month, and the rectal bleeding ceased. Over another month, he avoided wine and strong colors, and did not experience a relapse.</p>
<p>Another man had hemorrhoids for over ten years, with the area already ulcerated and unable to pass stool. Each episode caused him great pain. After inserting a specific medicinal probe for seven days, the hemorrhoids turned black, and the edges of the sores gradually cracked. By the fifteenth day, the hemorrhoids fell off. He applied a special soothing ointment for half a month, and the area healed smoothly.</p>
<p>A man who was weak and had internal hemorrhoids with bleeding experienced a pale yellow complexion. He self-medicated with cold-blood-stopping medicines, but they were ineffective. Upon diagnosis, his spleen pulse was weak. The middle Qi was unable to regulate the blood. After taking a tonifying formula for over ten doses, his spirit markedly improved, and the bleeding decreased. He also took an enhanced version of the Four Gentlemen Decoction, alternating with the previous formula, and for over a month, he had no recurrence.</p>
<p>Generally, the causes of such symptoms vary; it is essential to identify the underlying reasons for treatment. For instance, if the vital energy is excessive, leading to dark and stagnant blood, the condition will present as fresh blood followed by feces, but the pulse will be strong. This indicates excess, and cooling and blood-stopping medicines should be effective. Conversely, if the body is thin and weak with a pale complexion, where fresh blood precedes feces and the pulse is weak, this signifies deficiency. It would be inappropriate to use cooling medicines in such cases, as they could harm the spleen and stomach. Therefore, if the symptoms do not warm and strengthen the spleen and uplift the middle Qi, the blood cannot return to normalcy, making effective treatment difficult and damaging the root cause.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>A man suffered from a buttock abscess; after four or five days, he began to feel pain, and by evening, he developed chills. His pulse was floating and rapid. With the administration of two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San, the chills and fever subsided, and the pain eased slightly. As he had pressing official duties, he used a needle to pierce the top of the affected area by about five or six fen, allowing purple blood to flow out. He inserted a strip of toad venom and applied an ointment. Then, he took two servings of active blood dispersing and stasis resolving soup; the next day, purple blood flowed out, and he was able to move freely again. He continued with five or six servings of the regulating medications until he was stable.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a buttock abscess for six or seven days, experiencing severe pain and fever, with dry mouth and stools. He took the regulating and detoxifying powder, adding flower pollen and rhubarb, which relieved his constipation and thirst. He continued with the previous soup, adding horn needle and pangolin scales for several servings until the pus erupted. He then took Shi Quan Da Bu Tang for half a month until the condition resolved.</p>
<p>A man had a buttock abscess that was hard and unripe; this was due to a previous deficiency of cold and coolness. He took Shi Quan Da Bu Tang combined with soapberry, atractylodes, and peony for four doses, which gradually softened the hardness. He then took three doses of purulent penetrating powder, resulting in the pus ripening. Following this, he took the previous soup with double the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes for over a month until the abscess closed.</p>
<p>A man fell ill during the summer months with a buttock abscess, treating himself for internal toxicity by applying mashed crow&#39;s foot externally. He also drank more than ten bowls of cold water daily. After three days of this, the sore’s toxins became contained; the surface of the abscess flattened and cooled, and he became mute and uncommunicative, with a pulse as thin as a thread—deemed untreatable. He died by nightfall.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　夫痔者，乃素积湿热，过食炙煿，或因久坐而血脉不行，又因七情而过伤生冷，以及担轻负重，竭力远行，气血纵横，经络交错；又或酒色过度，肠胃受伤，以致浊气瘀血，流注肛门，俱能发痔。此患不论老幼男妇皆然。盖有生于肛门之内，有突于肛外之旁。治分内外，各自堤防。大者若莲花、蜂窠、翻花、鸡冠、菱角、珊瑚等状，小者如樱珠、鼠尾、牛奶、鸡心、核桃、蚬肉之形。故积毒深者，其形异而顽恶；毒浅者，其形正而平常。久则崩溃成漏，新则坠肿刺疼。甚者粪从孔出，血流窍中，气血日有所伤，形容渐有所削。若不早治，终至伤人。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>因常治法，多用针刀砒硇线坠等法，患者受之苦楚，闻者因循，都不医治。予疗此证，药味数品，从火煅炼，性即纯和，百试百验，此方法由来异矣。凡疗内痔者，先用通利药荡涤脏腑；然后用唤痔散涂之肛门内，片时痔自然泛出，即用葱汤洗净，搽枯痔散，早、午、晚每日三次，俱用温汤洗净，然后搽药，轻者七日，重者十一日，其痔自然枯黑干硬，停止枯药；其时痔边裂缝流脓，换用起痔汤，日洗一次，待痔落之后，换搽生肌散，或凤雏膏等药，生肌敛口。虚者，兼服补药，其口半月自可完矣。外痔者，用消毒散煎洗，随用枯痔散，照内痔搽法用之，自始至终无异。完口百日入房，乃吉。至于穿肠久漏者，用胡连追毒丸、黄连闭管丸服之，不用针刀挂线，效如拾芥耳。　　看法<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>　　初起，形如牛奶，不肿不红，无焮无痛，行走不觉者，轻。已成，肿痛，有时遇劳而发，或软或硬，头出黄水者，轻。久如鸡冠、蜂窠、莲花、翻花等状，脓血不止者，重。漏通臀腿，脓水淋漓，疼痛不已，粪从孔中而出者，逆。　　治法<br>　　初起及已成，渐渐大而便濇作痛者，宜润燥及滋阴。肛门下坠，大便去血，时或疼痛坚硬者，宜清火渗湿。紫色疼痛，大便虚秘，兼作痒者，凉血祛风，疏利湿热。肿痛坚硬，后重坠刺，便出难者，外宜熏洗，内当清利。内痔去血，登厕脱肛而难上收者，当健脾升举中气。便前后下血，面色痿黄，心忪耳鸣者，宜养血健脾。诸痔欲断其根，必须枯药以完其窍，必杜房劳，乃愈。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>　　　　　臀痈论</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Clear Yang emerges from the upper orifice, and Turbid Yin emerges from the lower orifice. </p>
<p>(Note: The Clear Yang of a person originates from Heaven and exits through the upper orifice. The Turbid Yin of a person originates from Earth and exits through the lower orifice. The Yin and Yang of a person are analogous to the rising of clouds and the falling of rain, connecting the energies of Heaven and Earth.) </p>
<p>The Yin flavor emerges from the lower orifice, while the Yang energy emerges from the upper orifice. </p>
<p>(Note: Flavor has substance, thus it flows downwards through the portal of excretion. Energy is formless, hence it emerges from the portal of respiration.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The Gate of the Spirit (Po Men) also functions for the five organs, and water and grains cannot be stored for long.</p>
<p>(Note: The Gate of the Spirit refers to the anus. It correlates with the lungs above, thus it is named the Gate of the Spirit. The impurities of the five organs exit from here, making it a lower orifice of the five organs. The filth of the intestines and stomach is expelled from here, hence it is said that water and grains cannot be stored for long.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Vital Energy Connecting to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Yang energy, when pure, nourishes the spirit; when gentle, nourishes the sinews. If the opening and closing are not regulated, cold energy enters, leading to severe hunching. A sunken pulse indicates a fistula, lingering within the flesh. </p>
<p>(Note: Yang energy nourishes the spirit of the five organs internally and promotes the development of tendons and bones externally, having both opening and closing dynamics, both ingress and egress. If the mechanism of opening and closing is lost, cold energy penetrates and diminishes internally. The back represents Yang; if Yang is deficient, cold evils obstruct the back, causing the body to hunch. If Yang is insufficient to uphold the nourishment of blood, the evils sink into the pulse, forming a fistula and lingering between the layers of flesh.) </p>
<p>Thus, excessive eating leads to sinews and pulses becoming slack, while the intestines and rectum are plagued by hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the yang energy is depleted, it cannot solidify the yin, leading to damage to the essence and blood. If one indulges in overeating and excessive strength, this condition manifests. The liver stores blood and governs the tendons, while the food energy enters the stomach, spreading the essence to the liver and the intoxicating energy to the tendons. If the liver is harmed, and one continues to overeat, the food energy cannot disperse, causing the sinews and vessels to become obstructed below. When the food energy stagnates, damp-heat accumulates in the yangming large intestine, resulting in hemorrhoids. The intestines and stomach are interconnected; food that enters the stomach cannot ascend and thus flows back down.</p>
<p>As for the strengthening influence of the yang, it solidifies and approaches, not being timely water ice; the transformation into feathers follows. Hemorrhoids and dysentery develop; cold and constriction enter the stomach, leading to internal heart pains. Inside, there are abscesses; hidden curves are unfavorable, mutually attracting the yin aspects. </p>
<p>The cold water energy of the greater yang prevails, which is why it solidifies and approaches. The &quot;not timely water ice&quot; reflects that this influence existed more than half a year ago, which is why the moths transform later. If the condition relates to the channel of the greater yang, it pertains to those suffering from hemorrhoids and dysentery caused by the cold and hot evils of the greater yang. Constriction entering the stomach is indicative of water overcoming earth. The stomach channels ascend to the heart, hence the heart pain. The presence of abscesses signifies hidden curves being unfavorable, mutually attracting the yin aspects. In the lesser yin&#39;s return, there are rashes, ulcers, carbuncles, boils, and hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Examination of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The anus weighs twelve taels, measures eight inches in circumference, approximately two and a half inches in diameter, and is twenty-eight inches long, receiving nine sheng and three he of grain, equating to one eighth of a he.<br><strong>Qian Jin Fang</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Between Obstruction and Openness</strong></p>
<p>The anus governs the large passageway, corresponding to the lungs and the large intestine, and is referred to as the official of passage. It weighs twelve taels, measures twelve inches in length, and two inches and two fen in width, corresponding to twelve times in a day. If the organs are injured by heat, the anus will become blocked, and the passage will be obstructed, or it may swell and ulcerate. If the organs are injured by cold, the anus will open, leading to diarrhea, protrusion, and will take a long time to retract. Heat should be treated with expulsion, while cold requires reinforcement. The anus controls the lungs; if the lung heats correspond to the anus, it causes blockage, unsuitable passage and swelling, leading to ulcerations. </p>
<p>For treatment, combine three sheng of honey and boil until dry. Then, mix it with cold water to form pills, six to seven inches in length, to be inserted into the anus, with the body turned upside down and the head downwards. After a while, remove them; this will lead to immediate passage and relief.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Hidden Lower Worm</strong> </p>
<p>When one suffers from typhoid or febrile diseases and experiences internal heat, accompanied by a reduced appetite and emptiness in the intestines and stomach, three worms begin to seek food and consume the five viscera and lower parts of the body. If the gums have no color, the tongue is completely white, and in severe cases, there are sores inside the lips, the limbs feel heavy, and there is a tendency to sleep excessively. One should examine the inside of the upper lip for sores, spitting blood; if the inside of the lips resembles millet sores, then the heart is restless and painful, indicating that the worm in the upper part is consuming the five viscera. If there are sores inside the lower lip and the person enjoys sleeping, then the worm in the lower part is consuming the lower region. If one is not aware, they can take this worm-eradicating medicine. Otherwise, the hidden lower worm will be lethal.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that those afflicted with the moist hidden lower worm are often those who have suffered from heat-related illnesses or have persistent chronic diarrhea, or have some external heat lodged in the abdomen, or have been affected by warm, humid conditions. Such conditions can easily lead to this disease. There can also be cases of dry hidden lower worms that do not manifest as severe diarrhea but cause itching in the lower parts. Regardless of whether it is dry or moist, if it persists, it can be fatal. </p>
<p>For those with moist conditions who feel cold with symptoms like diarrhea, boiling herbs such as Coptis chinensis, mugwort leaves, or bitter herb can be used. If the patient has colorless gums, a white tongue, or feels drowsy and irritable without recognizing the areas of pain or itchiness, or has diarrhea, it is crucial to treat the lower parts urgently. Those who are unaware may only treat the upper parts and neglect the lower. If there are worms in the lower region, they will consume the anus, leading to decay, revealing the five viscera, and ultimately resulting in death. Burning mugwort in a bamboo tube and using the smoke for treatment is advised. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are five types of hemorrhoids: the first is male hemorrhoid, the second is female hemorrhoid, the third is pulse hemorrhoid, the fourth is intestinal hemorrhoid, and the fifth is blood hemorrhoid. The male hemorrhoid appears at the anus like a mouse&#39;s milk, frequently discharging pus and blood. The female hemorrhoid causes swelling and pain, leading to sores. The pulse hemorrhoid has sores at the anus accompanied by itching and pain. The intestinal hemorrhoid causes painful lumps at the anus with cold and heat sensations. The blood hemorrhoid involves defecating clear blood, which stains the stool.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are five more hemorrhoids: the gas hemorrhoid, which arises from cold, warmth, labor, and dampness; it is associated with snake shedding its skin. The male hemorrhoid grows fleshy like mouse&#39;s milk and protrudes from the opening, causing issues when changing clothes, and is treated with tortoise shell. The female hemorrhoid grows outward from the opening, ulcerating and discharging pus and blood after five or six days; it is treated with hedgehog skin. The intestinal hemorrhoid protrudes during changing clothes and takes time to retreat; it is treated with the suspended hoof of a mother pig. The pulse hemorrhoid produces clear blood during changing clothes and is treated with beehives.</p>
<p>Each of these five types should be divided into equal parts, with the primary medicine doubled to three parts, taken in the morning with a spoonful of well water. For severe cases, it can be taken morning and evening or four to five doses. Avoid cold, raw pig meat, freshwater fish, vegetables, and sexual relations. Only consume dry white meat. After the hemorrhoids heal, sexual relations should be avoided for a hundred days. There are also medicines that guide treatment to the lower part, for internal sores, and inside the openings for those without sores. Additionally, there is wild kudzu powder, knives and chisels, mixed with internal medicine; take for five days to know the results, typically healing in twenty days and completely recovering in thirty. Hemorrhoid pain should avoid consuming water shield.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are five types of hemorrhoids: male hemorrhoids, female hemorrhoids, intestinal hemorrhoids, pulse hemorrhoids, and blood hemorrhoids. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Indulging in excessive food leads to the obstruction of the meridians and results in hemorrhoids. Disorders of the organs mainly arise from irregular eating habits, excessive drinking at inappropriate times, indulging in rich and fatty foods, consuming spicy peppers, strong wines, and a variety of meats, being overly indulgent and drunk, indulging in pleasures without moderation, exposure to severe cold or heat, prolonged sitting in damp places, excessively engaging in visual stimuli, and holding in bowel movements for extended periods. These habits cause an imbalance of yin and yang, leading to blockages and the influx of wind and heat, resulting in the emergence of the five types of hemorrhoids. With a disruption in natural order, the public&#39;s behavior further deteriorates; now hemorrhoids have developed into twenty-five different categories. They may present on either the left or right side, as internal or external, resembling either mouse milk or cherries, and may manifest as pus or blood, causing pain or itchiness, swelling or hardness. If untreated for long, they may ultimately develop into a chronic condition.</p>
<p>The primary treatment involves cooling the blood gradually. One must never use arsenic or toxic drugs, nor should one carelessly resort to surgical removal, as this may lead to chronic sores. There is also a separate channel at the anus, which secretes pus and blood, known as a single leak. For its treatment, one should use warming medicines to nourish the interior and apply restorative ointments externally. Openings in the skin are easier to heal, but those resulting from internal damage are more challenging to treat.</p>
<p>Lotus seed hemorrhoids resemble lotus seeds. Connecting intestinal hemorrhoids have their roots inside the organs and incur when defecating. Qi hemorrhoids manifest upon exposure to certain airs. Leak hemorrhoids occur due to weakened qi and blood from prolonged fatigue and indulgence without proper cleansing. Hooked intestinal hemorrhoids wrap around the head of the intestine. Lotus flower hemorrhoids resemble lotus flowers.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Hemorrhoids resembling a chicken heart are termed &quot;chicken heart hemorrhoids.&quot; Those that hang down like pearls are called &quot;pearl hemorrhoids.&quot; &quot;Pierced hemorrhoids&quot; are those that are penetrated and exude pus and blood. &quot;Chestnut hemorrhoids&quot; resemble chestnuts. &quot;Angular hemorrhoids&quot; have sharp angles. &quot;Looping intestine hemorrhoids&quot; are found within the coiled intestines. &quot;Parent-child hemorrhoids&quot; consist of one large and one small. &quot;Flipping flower hemorrhoids&quot; appear like a flower flipped open, emerging immediately upon using the toilet. &quot;Mouse milk hemorrhoids&quot; resemble mouse milk. &quot;Double-headed hemorrhoids&quot; have two ends. &quot;Pressing intestinal hemorrhoids&quot; are those that tightly press against the anus. &quot;Blood attacking hemorrhoids&quot; are those that bleed. &quot;Couple hemorrhoids&quot; consist of one round and one long, representing male and female. &quot;Coral hemorrhoids&quot; resemble coral. &quot;Prolapsed hemorrhoids&quot; are those that descend below the anus. &quot;Hanging intestine hemorrhoids&quot; are those that lie horizontally at the anus. &quot;Three confounding hemorrhoids&quot; have three beads, representing confusions of wealth, alcohol, and lust, which are indeed the causes of the illness. &quot;Cherry hemorrhoids&quot; resemble cherries. &quot;Male and female hemorrhoids&quot; arise from indulgence in alcohol, lust, and toxic food, resulting in one being black and the other white. </p>
<p>The above hemorrhoids have different names but belong to the same category. Why? They all arise from the colon&#39;s pathway, with deep wind-heat and kidney deficiency leading to a clash of cold and heat. Overindulgence in pork, chicken, fish, raw food, strong liquor, spicy flavors, or a lack of cleanliness in toilet habits can cause wind evils and be affected by the six qi and seven emotions. Even those who normally do not drink can suffer from hemorrhoids due to visceral weakness. Some are hereditary, formed from the mother&#39;s blood and father&#39;s essence. Intestinal wind is a progressive factor of blood hemorrhoids; thus, promptly take cooling blood tonics. Maintain a light workload, avoid anger, steer clear of lust, and be careful with diet, then healing can be achieved.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>The lungs and large intestine are interrelated, so when the lungs are filled with heat, the anus becomes closed and constipated; when the lungs are weak and cold, the anus prolapses. This is a principle that is quite evident. Additionally, women who have experienced excessive childbirth may become exhausted and lose blood, leading to a deficiency of qi that causes downward displacement; similarly, children with prolonged diarrhea can also have a protruding anus. The treatment should focus on warming and nourishing the lungs and replenishing the intestines and stomach, which over time can lead to natural retraction. </p>

<p>Internal toxins occur at the end of the large intestine, near the anus. Their nature is fierce, stemming from unpredictable emotions, irregular eating, imbalance of yin and yang, and disharmony among the internal organs. It may arise from excessive sexual activity, drinking strong alcohol, or consuming pungent and spicy foods, leading to toxin accumulation within. This can develop into swelling and pain near the anus, with hard stools causing distension and pain. Smaller ones may appear like beads, while larger ones resemble plum pits. They can create heat from cold and cause excruciating pain, leading to significant swelling and protrusion. Early treatment leads to easy recovery; neglect can lead to pus and decay.

<p>This abscess occurs in the kidney channel, and the buttock belongs to the lesser yang and bladder, which are the deepest of the yin, with pathways that are distant and remote, making them difficult for medicinal power to reach; hence, prior supplementation is necessary. This occurs due to a combination of deficiency, cold, dampness, and toxins that gather to create wind, leading to this condition. One should use medications that assist from above and below to treat it, such as the Baidu Liqi Decoction, Neitui Liqi Decoction, and Neitui Qianghuo Soup.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>The wind-heat hemorrhoid condition arises from the hand taiyin and hand yangming channels responding to the arteries, indicating that the lung and large intestine are interconnected, serving as conduits for the waste. There are five types of wind-heat hemorrhoids, each with differing symptoms. This is due to the qi of yang being deficient, resulting in a blocked original residence, allowing wind pathogenic factors to invade, leading to the creation of heat. Wind, dampness, and heat attack the intestines, causing the stools to be dry, hot, and obstructed, while blood heat disperses and overflows, soaking the intestines. Thus, the pattern of going to the bathroom first and then bleeding indicates heat is in the lower area, whereas bleeding first and then the bowel movement indicates heat is in the upper area. If it remains unresolved for long, it develops into hemorrhoids. The “Suwen” states: Overeating leads to the loosening of the meridians, causing marital strain and resulting in the intestines to become inflamed, which leads to hemorrhoids. This is because the wind and heat do not disperse, and the food qi overflows, transferring to the lower regions, resulting in swelling at the anus, forming knots as hard as plum or jujube pits; in severe cases, it may even develop into a fistula.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five internal organs should be well-maintained and not allowed to be harmed by external evils. The Hand Yangming (Large Intestine) is termed &quot;harmful to the Flying Insects.&quot; According to the &quot;Theory of Six Origins and Proper Organization&quot;: Yangming is the governor of the killing chamber, and the Large Intestine is called harmful to the Flying Insects, indicating that metal can damage the five insects. It also states: the killing chamber signifies that metal governs killing. Given these two names, how can insects arise? This is because the fire of the three energizing compartments is excessive, capable of restraining the Yangming metal, thus wood comes to insult it. The text states: to insult means to overcome oneself; wood governs the birth of the five insects. Shuhe states: Stagnant Qi accumulates next to the spleen, causing the Large Intestine to experience painful spasms that are hard to endure. It is only wise to slightly drain the heat from the three compartments and not to hastily adopt many methods to establish clarity and principles. This means that excessive drinking and consuming hot foods generate great heat in the spleen, thus enhancing the Qi of the three compartments, while fire can generate earth. One should drain the fire and heat from the three compartments so that metal can regain its Qi and counteract wood. When wood is restrained, the five insects will not be born, and the illness will naturally heal.</p>

<p>The treatment method is the same as above. Additionally, Da Huang Qian Niu Wan San (a medicinal formula) can be used to overcome it, with the considerations being the same for both dry and moist conditions. The treatment for hemorrhoids, intestinal pain, and rectal bleeding all follows the same principle of addressing internal toxin.</p>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids Swelling and Pain</strong></p>
<p>For milk hemorrhoids and intestinal wind, there must be a mass on the left and right of the anus, corresponding to the large intestine channel; one may take medicinal substances like Zhike (bitter orange). A major mass causing intestinal wind, connected to milk hemorrhoids. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; swelling and pain from hemorrhoids result from overeating, causing tension in the sinews, leading to intestinal splintering resulting in hemorrhoids. If not resolved, it turns into leakage. The treatment for hemorrhoids and leakage follows the same method. The &quot;Essential Discussion&quot; states: When the Yang energy is excessive, condensation occurs, not due to seasonal water freezing, producing hemorrhoids and malaria. The annotation explains that excessive water energy overwhelms Yang fire. This indicates that Yang fire fears water, stagnating and causing hemorrhoids. Additionally, for lesser Yin returns, rashes and sores, carbuncles, and hemorrhoids can arise. The annotation explains that internal fire steams up while metal energy outside resists, causing internal heat stagnation, resulting in rashes and sores. Severe rashes can also lead to sores. When heat is low, external rashes develop; when heat is high, internal carbuncles form. If there is heat in the small intestine, it can externally lead to hemorrhoids. The transformation of heat typically affects the back and outer side of the body. Furthermore, the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: When the solar channel is deficient, it results in hemorrhoids, malaria, and convulsions. This is due to water deficiency being overrun by fire. One may first use Daoshui Wan (a medicinal formula), Yu Gong San (a formula), and purgation; then take Zhike Wan (bitter orange pill) and Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan (a formula with nutmeg and betel nut); additionally, using sunflower and spinach to facilitate bowel movements. It is crucial to avoid cohabitation, chicken, fish, alcoholic vinegar, and spicy hot foods.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: When one indulges in excessive eating, the sinews and vessels become obstructed, leading to hemorrhoids. The large intestine is associated with the metal element, which governs fluids; its nature is dry and clear, and it has a regulating energy that oversees the retention of fluids, contributing to the transformation from the foot Yangming. If this transformation is robust, it gives rise to all things. The foot Yangming represents the fertile land of the Central Plains; when it weakens, it can destroy all things, hence it is said that all things are born from the earth and return to it. However, the hands and feet of Yangming together govern this transformation. Being situated in the western region, it is susceptible to various harms, particularly through overindulgence in food and sexual activity leading to constipation. The energy from the anterior orifice returns to the large intestine, allowing the wood element to overpower the fire element, thereby disrespecting the dry metal element. With fire igniting dryness, constipation inevitably arises, resulting in hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

Thus, it is said that sweet cold purges heat, relying on the cold nature of bitter orange. The ancients utilized medicine to focus on the lower abdomen as a channel, and it is said that for those below, one should draw out and drain it, often leading to constipation, which can be relieved with rhubarb; when fluids and blood are insufficient, Angelica can harmonize blood along with oily, moistening medications to naturally soften and ease bowel movements.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

Various discussions suggest that this arises from excessive indulgence in wine and rich foods, careless overindulgence can disrupt the balance of yin and yang, disturb the blood vessels, and lead to inflammation and leakage in the intestines. This results in sores around the anus, transforming into hemorrhoids. The treatment begins at the first sign of hemorrhoids by taking pills to promote circulation or pills made from sophora fruit. For those with heat symptoms, drinking various purging decoctions to clear the organ systems and bathing or steaming to disperse the problem is recommended. One must avoid alcohol, spicy, and fatty foods. If desires are not reined in, it may lead to festering wounds, or the lingering of pus and blood, and with time, it may develop into anal fistulas, requiring the use of specialized instruments for treatment, which may necessitate three to five applications for recovery.

<p>The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; therefore, if there is heat accumulation in the lungs, it can lead to rectal closure, and if the lungs are deficient and cold, it may lead to rectal prolapse. Furthermore, complications from childbirth and prolonged diarrhea in children can also contribute to this condition. Thus, it is essential to warm the lungs and nourish the intestines, as prolonged treatment will naturally resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids primarily focus on cooling the blood. Hemorrhoids are due to the inherent weakness of the internal organs, external injuries from wind and dampness, internal accumulation of heat toxins, and excessive eating and drinking, which lead to a downward descent of Qi and blood, causing congestion around the rectum, which results in hemorrhoids. </p>
<p>There are different types: external hemorrhoids present as fleshy protrusions resembling mouse nipples, often dripping pus and blood, referred to as male hemorrhoids. Inflammation and pain near the anus leading to the formation of a single protrusion that ruptures to discharge pus is known as female hemorrhoids. Large, painful, and itchy growths at the anal region with bleeding are termed pulse hemorrhoids. Internally generated lumps with blood, experiencing alternating cold and heat, and causing prolapse is known as intestinal hemorrhoids. If it is blood hemorrhoids, there is continuous clear blood discharge with defecation.

<p>The treatment method is primarily to alleviate heat, regulate blood, and smooth the qi. When there is heat, it injures the blood; when the blood is injured, the meridians become stagnant; when the meridians are stagnant, the qi does not circulate.

The size of the moxibustion should correlate with the size of the leak: larger moxibustion for larger leaks, smaller for smaller leaks.

If we analyze them, there are thirty-six types with different names. Generally speaking, external injuries, the four seasons, internal distress from the seven emotions, dietary irregularities, exposure to harmful influences, and the ingestion of toxic substances can all lead to the formation of fistulas and sores. If a hole becomes deeply penetrated and the pus does not cease, combined with cold and wind pathogens, it gradually becomes a leak. There are recent leaks and long-standing leaks. Recent ones appear with a light red color, possibly slightly swollen or with small nodules; long-standing ones become dry and white on the surface, black and rotten inside, with foul-smelling parasites emerging.</p>

Even if there is much blood, the qi cannot reach it; when qi does not reach, blood is also rarely present. After middle age, if an abscess develops, there will only be pain and swelling. If we examine the pulse and symptoms, we will see weakness, and one should supplement to ensure that blood and qi are not deficient, so that one can ultimately avoid misfortune.

<p><strong>Piles and Fistulas</strong></p>
<p>Intestinal wind and piles are general terms, but they differ in specifics. If it ruptures, it is called a fistula; if there is constipation, it will certainly cause great pain. This is due to wind and heat invading the stomach, leading to fullness that isn&#39;t released, causing pressure on the large intestine. Therefore, it is said in the classics: “Due to excessive eating, the meridians are obstructed, resulting in piles.” Those afflicted have dry heat. The illness is due to heat in the stomach. When the stomach punishes the large intestine, it turns moist heat into dryness and taps into the real essence of dryness and heat. Wind attaching to heat appears as a combination of dampness, heat, wind, and dryness, hence the hardened mass at the head of the large intestine indicates dampness, while severe pain is caused by wind, and dry, hard stools indicate a disease combined with the invasion of fire and heat. All four of these factors must be addressed. The lungs in the west govern all qi and, being contractive, can also contribute to the illness as an evil influence; thus, it is necessary to use qi-dispersing herbs alongside treatment for a complete approach. Pills should not be made; it is effective to administer as a powder through a sifter, yielding remarkable results.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids (Prolapse of the Rectum)</strong></p>
<p>Prolapse of the rectum is most difficult to treat with medication. If there is heat, the anus closes; if there is cold, the anus prolapses. Internally, use two qian (a unit of weight) of powdered magnetite, mixed with rice water before meals; externally, wash with a warm solution of rust.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction of Hemorrhoids, Fistula, and Blood from Intestinal Wind</strong></p>
<p>Blood from intestinal wind comes from within the intestines, whereas blood from hemorrhoids emerges from the dirty openings of the anus; the treatments differ. The Wuzuo Wulian Decoction is used for pulse hemorrhoids. If there is a shape with blood flowing like an arrow or dripping continuously, it originates from the pulse orifices.</p>
<p><strong>Combination of Internal and External Treatments for Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of hemorrhoids and fistulas vary greatly. Since the blood comes from within, one cannot rely solely on external application; it is advisable to take pills such as Kuan San for internal treatment. If there is profuse bleeding during hemorrhoid onset, it is also best to treat from the inside, using a formula to replenish internally, reducing the quantity of cassia by half and adding tortoise shell blood for better results. </p>
<p>If the lower part of the colon protrudes by more than an inch and is painful, one should wait for it to retract. If it keeps protruding, this is termed &quot;interrupted bowel disease.&quot; If the bowel completely protrudes without treatment, only the initial inch can be treated. Use sesame oil in a vessel to sit on, and drink several sheng of hemp seed juice to achieve a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Parasitic Infection at the Anus</strong></p>
<p>If the parasitic infection at the anus does not stop and reoccurs, hindering movement and sitting, take five qian of powdered herb known as crane&#39;s tail mixed with water to drink for self-cure.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Alternate Names for the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The anus is the lower segment of the large intestine. It is also referred to as the broad intestine, which indicates that it is wider than the small intestine. Additionally, it is called the &quot;gate of the soul,&quot; as the large intestine is the organ associated with the lungs, which house the &quot;soul.&quot; The term &quot;anus&quot; refers to its shape, resembling a wheel hub.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Rectal Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; in cases of illness, what enters the body is considered real, while what exits is regarded as false. If the anus prolapses, it is not considered a false condition. Factors include excessive labor during sexual activity, prolonged exertion during childbirth, chronic dysentery, chronic diarrhea, and excessive crying from infants, all of which may lead to this condition. It is advisable to take a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and bulbus, with a little schisandra. In cases of blood deficiency, add peony and rehmannia; for deficiency with cold, add roasted black ginger; and for deficiency combined with heat, use &quot;Suo Sha San.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is heat present alongside the prolapse, heat causes circulation. For heat due to qi, use six taels of qinghao and one tael of angelica, mixed into pills. For blood heat, use the &quot;Four Substance Decoction&quot; with the addition of huanglian and angelica. For wind pathogens, use the &quot;Baiduhong San.&quot; For summer heat, use huanglian in ejiao pills or mint decoction.</p>
<p>The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; if lung heat is present, the anus can become congested, whereas lung cold can lead to prolapse. It is essential to warm the lung and nourish the spleen and stomach, using &quot;Jia Jian Bao Zheng Tang&quot; with a small amount of haritaki and mulberry bark. Alternatively, use &quot;Sheng Yang Ju Jing Tang,&quot; &quot;Wei Pi San,&quot; or &quot;Diao Chang Wan.&quot; If there is damp-heat, employ &quot;Sheng Yang Chu Shi Tang.&quot; If there is concurrent dysentery, use the &quot;Four Substance Decoction&quot; with sophora flavescens, huanglian, and angelica. For kidney deficiency, use &quot;Shen Qi Wan&quot; or &quot;Ba Wei Wan.&quot;<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p>For buttocks maggot sores that are painful and itchy, use Feng ointment. If it is just very itchy with an abundance of worms, use one tael of sulfur, which people say is pulverized into powder, mix with vinegar, and slowly heat it until it dries. Revive it in heat; when the fire rises, sprinkle vinegar several times, pour it onto the ground, wait for it to cool and solidify into a cake. Grind it with sesame oil until thick, apply to the sore when it itches and has been scratched, and it will heal in three days.</p>
<h3>Five Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>The Classic states: overeating causes the muscles and veins to become unbound, leading to intestinal polyps that result in hemorrhoids. Overeating causes the spleen to be unable to function, causing food to accumulate in the large intestine. When the spleen is weak, the lungs lose nourishment, and the liver becomes timid. Wind pathogens take advantage of this weakness and flow downwards, leading to light cases of intestinal wind and blood, and in severe cases, it transforms into hemorrhoids. Alternatively, becoming drunk and overeating in bed causes the essence and energy to leak, allowing heat and toxins to descend. Or excessive indulgence in bed can damage the muscles, leading to the retention of essence and toxins. In severe cases, this can result in sexual acts between men, injuring the bladder, kidneys, and liver sinews. The bladder meridians connect to the waist, which leads to the kidneys, also runs to the liver, and encircles the front and back yin. Therefore, hemorrhoids are considered a disease of the meridians; when they appear, the face will turn blue, and there will be intense pain, indicating liver distress. </p>
<p><strong>The Five Hemorrhoids:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Male Hemorrhoid</strong>: resembles a rat&#39;s milk near the anus.  </li>
<li><strong>Female Hemorrhoid</strong>: a sore forms by the anus that sinks in.  </li>
<li><strong>Intestinal Hemorrhoid</strong>: a nodular swelling in the intestines, with prolapse and bleeding.  </li>
<li><strong>Blood Hemorrhoid</strong>: bright red blood flows like a thread with bowel movements.  </li>
<li><strong>Pulse Hemorrhoid</strong>: frequent passage of blood from the rectum (indicating pain and itchiness).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Five Hemorrhoids Powder is the main treatment for this condition.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also conditions of qi hemorrhoids, where the anus is swollen and painful, making it difficult to pass stool. Straining causes the anus to not contract. Prescription: added flavored Xiangsu powder. For wine hemorrhoids, they flare up with alcohol consumption; use Gan Ge soup. For worm hemorrhoids, which are soaked and rotten, accumulating over the years, eroding the intestines and creating holes; use Wei Pi pill and Heiyu pill. Generally, for deep toxins, they are as large as a chicken comb, lotus flower, or walnut; for superficial toxins, they are as small as pine nuts, cow&#39;s milk, chicken heart, mouse milk, or peach kernel, all indicating triple yin deficiency. Hemorrhoids are not caused by external evils but rather by internal damp heat, wind dryness, and the four qi combining, lingering in the large intestine and turning into toxins. If there are lumps at the intestinal entrance, it&#39;s dampness; if the anus feels heavy and swollen, it&#39;s damp combined with heat; pus and bloody water indicate heat overpowering blood; extreme pain indicates fire heat; pain and itching indicate wind heat; constipation indicates dry heat; frequent urination indicates liver fire damp heat. Moreover, if the sore head points upward or is hard, there is more heat; if it points down or is soft, there is more moisture. Heat injures the blood, and when the blood stagnates, qi cannot circulate, causing pain and heaviness in the lower intestine. Key treatments include Huaihua and Huai Jiao to cool the blood, Xiong, Gui, and Taoren to harmonize and nourish blood, Zhike to move qi and widen the intestines, Qin, Lian, and Shan Zhi to clear heat, Huanglian, Fangji, and Zexie to expel dampness, Ma Ren and Dahuang to moisten dryness, and Qin Jiao and Jingjie to dispel wind.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also cases of combined lower sores, those with a white discharge from the stem, and those with hernias, all resulting from insufficient liver and kidney function; one should not solely rely on cool, purging methods. Hemorrhoids and the five types of hemorrhoids arise from excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust, leading to these ailments. Many people treat externally through washing and applications, unaware that the disease is due to intestinal worms, and if the root is not addressed, the condition will not be resolved.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids can involve perforation of the intestines, the buttocks, or the genitals; there are also cases without hemorrhoids where a separate opening develops on either side of the anus, leaking pus and blood, known as a single discharge. Openings within the skin heal easily, while those affecting internal organs are more difficult to treat. Additionally, existing hemorrhoids could lead to the formation of an abscess at the edge of the anus, discharging through the hemorrhoid opening, indicating the presence of food stagnation; this should be treated with combined Weisang.</p>
<p>Bleeding hemorrhoids are fundamentally caused by heat. The discharge of pus and blood begins as damp heat, and over time, becomes damp cold. Initially, the symptoms appear as light red with slight swelling and small nodules, which should be treated with cooling blood and clearing heat to dry dampness, using remedies like Qian Niu Jiu, Jia Wei Huai Jiao Wan, Zang Tou Wan, Gu Zhi Ba Wan, and Lian Gui Wan. In long-standing cases, the internal condition appears as dried white, while the external shows black decay with a foul smell from parasitic worms; thus, it is necessary to drain openings, kill worms, and provide warmth and nourishment, using remedies like Hei Yu Dan, Diao Chang Wan, Xiong Gui Wan, Ku Shen Wan, and La Fan Wan. There are also cases that initially arise from wind-cold but may develop into deficiency combined with damp heat over time.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case - Ming Dynasty by Xue Ji</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prolapse of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>Prolapse of the anus is related to deficiency of qi and blood in the large intestine, compounded by damp-heat. Some cases arise from chronic diarrhea leading to both qi and blood deficiency; others stem from lung deficiency; some are due to deficiency of middle qi; and others result from kidney deficiency. For damp-heat, use Shengyang Zhushi Decoction. For blood-heat, incorporate Siwu Decoction with Scutellaria and Sophora flowers. For blood deficiency, add Baizhu and Poria to Siwu Decoction. If accompanied by hemorrhoids and pain, combine Siwu Decoction with Sophora flower, Coptis, and Cimicifuga. For chronic diarrhea, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with wine-fried Peony. In cases of middle qi deficiency causing prolapse, add Banxia, Paojiang, Poria, and Wuwu to the previous decoction. For kidney deficiency, apply Liuwei Dihuang Wan. For deficiency-cold, use Bafang Wan. The lungs and large intestine are interrelated; the anus is the gateway of the large intestine. If the lungs are in excess heat, this leads to constipation; if the lungs are deficient and cold, this causes prolapse. The kidneys govern bowel movements, hence those with kidney deficiency often suffer from this condition.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

The wealthy may suffer from indulgence in wine, lust, and material pursuits, while the poor may experience strain from carrying heavy loads, being hungry, or rising early—these all harm the heart and liver blood. Joy injures the heart, anger injures the liver; fluctuations in emotions can lead to the invasion of qi and blood into the large intestine, causing blockages that accumulate and lead to bleeding and formation of lumps. Women may suffer from cold after menstruation, while irregularities in the menstrual cycle may harm the heart&#39;s blood, leading to blood flowing into the large intestine. Children may be affected by heat during delivery or excess heat in the mother’s womb, resulting in clear liquid and oily matters. Hemorrhoids are associated with the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians; thus, depletion of yin essence makes them difficult to treat and often leads to symptoms of leakage. If the lung and large intestine meridians are affected by wind-heat or damp-heat, recovery may occur spontaneously once the heat subsides.

Heat and toxins invade the body, or extreme indulgence strongly retains essence, causing wood to overpower fire, thus humiliating metal; or from consuming rich flavors or overexertion damaging the vital energy, resulting in yin deficiency and fiery excess. Initially, there may be burning pain and constipation, or difficulty in urination. It is advisable to clear heat, cool the blood, moisten dryness, and disperse wind. If there is deficiency of qi and blood with cold damage, one should nourish the spleen and stomach, and replenish the yin essence. If the condition breaks and does not heal for a long time, it often leads to hemorrhoids and may include fissures in the anal or genital regions, or perforation of the intestines. Swelling at the intestinal head indicates damp heat; pain indicates wind heat; constipation indicates dry heat; and suppuration indicates heat overpowering blood. Pain during bowel movements should be treated by moistening dryness and eliminating dampness. Pain in the anal area should be treated by dissipating heat and eliminating dampness. If urination is obstructed, one should clear the liver and guide out dampness. For those forming leaks (fistulas), the focus should be on nourishing vital energy and replenishing yin essence.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Yu Tuan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: Excessive eating causes the muscles and veins to break apart, leading to hemorrhoids. It also states: The spleen and stomach are the storage organs, where the five flavors emerge. The large intestine is the channeling organ, responsible for transformations. When one overeats excessively, the spleen&#39;s energy becomes severely weakened and cannot process the refined essence, causing damage from morning till evening, resulting in a mix of clarity and turbidity. Therefore, food accumulates and flows downward into the large intestine, causing illness. When the spleen and stomach are deficient, the lung energy is also lacking, resulting in deficiencies in the energy of the large intestine. Consequently, the liver&#39;s wood can freely flow downward, causing intestinal wind disease. These various manifestations, although differing in appearance—such as cow&#39;s milk, mouse milk, chicken hearts, chicken crowns, lotus flowers, flipped flowers, beehives, pierced intestines, and external hemorrhoids—share the same underlying cause. </p>
<p>Treatment methods include: Using bitter cold herbs to purge heat, such as Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, and Sophora flower; employing warm acrid herbs to nourish the blood, including Angelica, Chuanxiong, and peach kernels. If wind evil is present below, use Gentiana, Fangfeng, and Cimicifuga to raise it; if dryness and heat are trapped, employ Rhubarb, Zhi ke, and hemp seeds to adjust. Those suffering from this ailment should be cautious with their diet and desires, and follow the prescribed treatments to ensure peace and comfort.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

The reason is that the wind energy connects with the liver, causing the liver to generate wind, which in turn creates heat. When the wind invades, it injures the essence; when the essence is lost, the pathogenic heat harms the liver. Therefore, when one overeats and engages in sexual activity, the muscles and tendons become compromised, resulting in intestinal afflictions and hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids, as mentioned in the &quot;Caoshi Discussion on Diseases,&quot; are classified into five types: male hemorrhoids, female hemorrhoids, pulsatile hemorrhoids, intestinal hemorrhoids, and blood hemorrhoids. Additionally, there are various names for hemorrhoids in ancient formulas, such as wine hemorrhoids, gas hemorrhoids, worm hemorrhoids, flipping flowers, and mole crickets, among others. Moreover, hemorrhoids can appear at the anal region (or be external or internal). They can resemble mouse milk or cherries, with various shapes. The symptoms may include pain and itching, hardness or softness, pus formation, or none, swelling with difficult bowel movements, or continuous bleeding with stools, and in some cases, perforation leading to blood flowing like a thread. There are even cases where improper treatment results in leakage, or perforations leading to feces passing through the openings.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are several lesions around the anus that are soaked with pus and blood like lotus flowers, then based on these symptoms, generally speaking: lesions near the anus that produce pus and blood are identified as male hemorrhoids; lesions near the anus that are sore, swollen, and bleeding are identified as female hemorrhoids; lesions near the anus that are both painful and itchy are identified as venous hemorrhoids; internal lumps in the anus with alternating cold and heat and bleeding are identified as intestinal hemorrhoids; swollen and painful anus with difficulty in defecation, where straining leads to protrusion of the anus that does not retract, are identified as gas hemorrhoids; ulcers and swelling around the anus that bleed and flare up with alcohol consumption are identified as alcohol hemorrhoids; if there are openings around the anus with blood spurting out like rays, they are identified as blood hemorrhoids; and if the anus is soaked and rotten, with pinworms eroding the intestines and creating perforations, they are termed as parasitic hemorrhoids. All these conditions originate from the large intestine, which corresponds to the element of metal (in the Five Elements theory). Its nature is dry, clear, and capable of regulatory action, primarily governing the absorption of fluid, transforming the materials derived from the Earth of the foot Yangming. When in a strong state, it can generate and transform all things, while when weakened, it harms everything. Thus, it is said that all things are born from the Earth and return to the Earth. The Yangming of both the hands and feet governs this transformation.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person is drunk and overindulges, their vital essence may be leaked, leaving their pulse empty. The heat from the alcohol becomes toxic and flows through the pulse. This may occur if one becomes drunk and excessively indulgent, and tries to forcefully retain their essence or uses medicine to hold it in, but it cannot be expelled and accumulates in the pulse. It returns to the large intestine, leading to wood overpowering fire and humiliating dry metal. When fire meets dryness, constipation occurs and hemorrhoids develop. Treatment should consist of bitter cold to purge fire, acrid warmth to harmonize blood, moisten dryness, and disperse wind, as well as pain-relieving prescriptions.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the pulse of the foot&#39;s sun bladder and its tendons all connect to the waist and influence the kidneys; its branches pass through the buttocks and feet. Therefore, if the tendons are the cause of a disease, this illness may arise. Additionally, the pulse of the foot&#39;s jueyin encircles the front and back yin, which can also lead to hemorrhoids. When observing someone affected by hemorrhoids, the initial manifestation is often blue in color and extremely painful, indicating that the liver is in distress. </p>
<p>Furthermore, although hemorrhoids and leaking both originate from similar causes, the resulting conditions are indeed different. A hemorrhoid that forms at the edge of the anus and does not rupture is called a hemorrhoid; if it ruptures and discharges pus and blood, with yellow fluid seeping and not stopping for a long time, it is referred to as a leakage. The initial cause of the illness is dryness; the underlying condition is damp heat. The stomach injures the large intestine, leading to the transformation of dry heat that exacerbates the damp heat condition.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the intestines form lumps, it is due to dampness; if there is pain, it is caused by wind; if pus and blood ooze out, it indicates heat overcoming rotting blood; if it forms yellow fluid, it is a mix of damp heat and wind dryness. If severe pain occurs with constipation, this is due to stagnant wind and heat causing obstruction, preventing passage, with qi pressing on the large intestine. If the large intestine is dry and hardened, it signifies a condition influenced by fire pathogens. All these ailments arise from the combination of dampness, heat, wind, and dryness. The condition of &quot;intestine leakage&quot; refers to blood in the stool. This typically occurs when one does not avoid the toxins of wind, indulges in strong alcohol and roasted foods, and allows emotions of desire and anger to fluctuate, resulting in stagnation in the organs and excess in dietary intake, ultimately harming the gut and leading to disharmony of yin and yang, blockage, and heat toxins descending, causing blood to seep into the large intestine, resulting in leakage and hemorrhoids that cannot be avoided. The classics state: when the muscles and veins are disrupted, and there is intestine leakage as in hemorrhoids, it refers to this. Despite differing names, the source is essentially the same. Generally, the condition of intestine leakage can either be treatable or not. If there is blood in the stool and a cold body, there is hope for survival. If white foam is present in the leakage and the pulse is deep, there is a chance for survival; if the pulse is floating, it is life-threatening. In cases of leaking pus and blood, a strong and smooth pulse indicates survival, while a pulse that is suspended and absent signifies death. For intestine leakage, if the spleen pulse is deep and distended, it may resolve itself over time; if the liver pulse is slightly weak, it is easier to treat; however, if the kidney pulse is deep and the body is hot, it is fatal. The method of treatment should focus on expelling wind, dispelling toxins, relieving heat, cooling the organs, harmonizing blood, and moistening dryness; if these are applied, healing is assured.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Rectal Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of rectal prolapse, the Classic of Difficult Issues states: conditions of the body can be categorized as either excess or deficiency; protrusion indicates deficiency, while retraction indicates excess. The protrusion of the anal region stems from deficiency, does it not? If one has excess, it generates warmth, and warmth allows for sufficient internal energy to be stored. If one has deficiency, it leads to coldness, and coldness results in a lack of internal energy that cannot hold. Moreover, the large intestine has thickness and thinness, corresponding to the lungs; when the lung organs possess heat, they close, but if they are deficient, prolapse occurs.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Three Causes&quot; discourse, women who suffer from this ailment often experience it due to excessive straining during childbirth. For children, this condition results from prolonged diarrhea, stemming from a cold and deficient large intestine. The anus is a continuation of the large intestine; if the large intestine is harmed by obstruction and one strains, the energy descends forcefully, causing the anus to prolapse. One can use herbal decoctions of Xiangfuzi (Cyperus) and Jingjie (Schizonepeta) for washing; or grind Wubeizi (Gallnut) into a fine powder, place it on paper, and gently massage it into the anus.</p>
<p>If it persists for a long time, males may develop rectal hemorrhoids, leading to an inability to retract the intestine. For protrusions of several inches, use decoctions of Wubeizi and (Shibai) Nitre for washing; also, use the ashes of horsetail that are not allowed to burn completely, with a small amount of musk, to apply after defecation for effectiveness.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of prolonged diarrhea causing internal deficiency, which can lead to rectal prolapse. If there is itching at the rectum, it indicates the presence of worms in the abdomen, likely due to excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence. The large intestine serves as the pathway for transformation, while the kidneys support strength; thus, if the kidneys are deficient, the vital energy leaks out, causing the lung deficiency, resulting in a lack of control over the large intestine and thus, the prolapse of the anus. </p>
<p>The treatment method focuses on restoring the original energy, removing accumulated heat, and using external washes of decoctions; with proper treatment, healing can invariably be achieved.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p>Hemorrhoids are divided into three types, so please observe carefully. Do not let the years pass, for those who see may feel dismayed. The shape of a water chestnut appears strange, while a lotus flower should not be ignored. The intestine is called &quot;mouse&#39;s milk,&quot; which is affected by both alcohol and color. Do not blame the dreadful turn of flowers; a beehive is not spacious either. Male and female share the same blood, affecting both child and mother&#39;s intestines. &quot;Primary pearls&quot; can be particularly alarming, as intestinal pain feels like a drill. Walnuts cause blood flow, making those who see feel saddened. Large chestnuts are inside, while &quot;chicken hearts&quot; are comfortably outside. The form of coral is detestable, how much more difficult is it to deal with prolapse? Internal hemorrhoids are red but do not protrude, lying within the intestines. Prolapsed pearls are even harder to treat; prolonged cases bear a &quot;chicken crown.&quot; Never use sharp knives or fire lightly, for it may cost you your life. After working hard for half a month, the illness may indeed be eradicated. The method of treating hemorrhoids is merely to cool the blood and clear heat. As for treating leakage, initially, it should cool the blood and dry dampness; over time, it should kill insects in the passages while also warming and dispersing. Some say: for leakage and burning, why use warming and drying medicine? They do not know that bleeding from hemorrhoids is ultimately caused by heat. Leakage releases pus, starting as damp heat and ending as damp cold. The &quot;Ten Leaks Golden Pill,&quot; though warm and dispersive, also nourishes. Thus, Danxi says: leakage should primarily focus on greatly supplementing qi and blood, there is a rationale behind this.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p>For all hemorrhoids, use the dried medicine of Master Zhou: apply in the morning and once more at noon, washing off the old medicine; at the time of Shen, wash again and apply once more. If urgent relief is needed, wash and apply again at midnight or the early hour. The next day, observe the hemorrhoid head; it should be a faint black color. For two or three days it may resemble dried plum, and within four or five days, use a bamboo stick to gently tap the hemorrhoid head; if it feels as hard as stone by the seventh or eighth day, simply stop further applications and wait for it to resolve naturally, much like the shedding of a radish root. Then use a decoction of licorice, schizope, and sophora flower to wash away the old medicine, and apply the new medicine.</p>
<p>As for methods to treat hemorrhoids: if one intends to begin treatment tomorrow, administer this medicine today to relax the intestines, facilitating smooth bowel movements without causing further issues with hemorrhoids. If the hemorrhoid head has not fallen off, it must be taken daily. Take one ounce of rhubarb simmered, stir-fried bitter orange peel, and one ounce of angelica root washed in wine, all ground to a fine powder, about the size of a tung seed, and swallow with good wine.</p>
<p>To treat with dried medicine for hemorrhoids, be cautious of other symptoms that may arise. The use of dried medicine may harm kidney roots, or cause painful urinary issues. Use one ounce each of rhubarb, houttuynia, and fresh Rehmannia, with half an ounce each of talc and dianthus, all ground to a fine powder. Take four qian each time, boiled and consumed.</p>
<p>To prompt hemorrhoids to fall off: if the dried matter has completely fallen, use this to stimulate it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Treatises</strong><br><strong>Ming - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Hemorrhoids and Fistulas</strong></p>
<p>Chunfu always employs treatment methods for hemorrhoids and fistulas that do not stray from those addressing damp-heat. The pathogenesis indeed aligns with the discussions of Dongyuan and Danxi. Generally, for mild cases, one can resolve them by draining water, dispersing dampness, moistening dryness, and soothing wind; all these methods can achieve healing. As for severe cases involving penetrating fistulas and connections in the buttocks, where there may be an egg-shaped tube present for a long time, the method from the &quot;Yonglei Qianfang&quot; involving thread treatment is necessary to eradicate the root cause. My colleague Cheng Fuzhai has deeply grasped the essence of this method, truly embodying the principle of pulling out the root and sealing the source, leading to healing without fail. I hereby seek to detail this method and append it for public benefit, hoping it may provide relief to those suffering from this ailment.</p>
<p><strong>Fuzhai&#39;s Method for Treating Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Lun on Vitality&quot; states: Overeating causes muscle and vessels to become strained, leading to intestinal rupture as hemorrhoids. Dongyuan believes that overeating and exerting force during labor result in the damp-heat of the spleen and stomach, which then exerts pressure on the large intestine causing rupture. It also states that overeating while burdened, difficulties in childbirth, and exertion in young children can likewise lead to intestinal rupture. This is indeed the source of the ailment. Thus, in mild cases, the large intestine is partially ruptured, with damp-heat seeping into the inner and outer layers of the intestine, causing it to descend and form nodules internally. They appear like grapes or lotus seed pods, blocking the passage for excretion, leading to prolapse during defecation, requiring time to retract; this is termed &quot;turning flowers.&quot; If due to wind-heat and dry stool, bowel movements become difficult, there can be instances where hemorrhoids rupture before feces are passed, leading to bleeding; similarly, after feces are passed, the hemorrhoids can break, resulting in bleeding. All these conditions stem from internal hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to the difficulty in expelling feces, the blood flow differs; thus, there is no consistent principle regarding the distance and timing of blood from intestinal wind. Therefore, when the tear is deep, the large intestine is completely ruptured, and the damp heat qi seeps outside the intestine, lingering in the flesh, flowing laterally outside the anus, forming lumps like cherries, milk, or cockscombs, sometimes connecting to the yin or yang, resulting in abscesses or hanging abscesses; or connecting to the buttocks, leading to buttock abscesses with pus flowing for a long time. Internally, the formations resemble goose tubes and corals, comparable to water in a mountain cave, which, after long dripping, forms stalactites. The branches of the goose tubes proliferate, and the sores are scattered, appearing like a honeycomb or rotten claws, with the skin corroded and flesh sunk, ultimately leading to chronic maladies; all of these stem from external hemorrhoids. Hence, although hemorrhoids can be internal or external, the depths of intestinal tears vary. Those treating the condition do not consider rooting out the source but merely observe that the stool is hard, indicating dryness and heat; after the sores swell, if they become heavy and the intestines form lumps, this indicates dampness and heat; severe pain suggests wind and heat. Parasites erode as wood damages metal; indeed, wood decays first before pests emerge, and once the intestine is ruptured, the poison begins to flow.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>First, one should establish a proper approach to balance the qi and blood, reduce heat and dispel wind, in order to adjust what is inside; additionally, use arsenic to probe the sores, to rot away the necrotic tissue, in order to treat the outside. Observing this, it is merely treating the symptoms and alleviating immediate concerns. If the affected area is close to the anus, and the necrotic tissue is removed, new flesh in the intestinal head may grow, which is merely a fortunate outcome; however, if the area is remote and difficult to access, even if one uses a rod to probe the anal canal, the area may remain large, causing adjacent sores to heal while the main opening proves hard to close, leading to a recurrence soon after, with the blame falling on the patient. I suffered from this ailment for seventeen years, perusing many texts and diligently following ancient treatments, yet all efforts were fruitless; I almost succumbed to arsenic, consumed by anxiety and fear. Later, I encountered Li Chunshan from Jiangyou, who simply used yarrow root boiled into a thread to sew up the large intestine; it took over seventy days to achieve complete success. Reflecting on this experience, I realized the principles. Subsequently, I treated several others, regardless of the number of sores, applying a method to probe a single hole with grass, tying a thread outside the intestine, and using a lead weight to suspend it, seeking quick results.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the medicinal thread is placed under the sun, the intestinal muscles grow stronger. With the surrounding area already treated, water flows along the thread, although it has not yet penetrated the wound. The gauze inside is absorbed, and within seven days, the skin returns to its original state. It is akin to building a dam to prevent flooding; once the water has returned to its course and all streams are dry, what flooding could there be? The time for the thread to fall varies based on the distance from the wound, whether a week or half a month, but it does not exceed two weeks. Once the thread has passed beyond the anus, it falls away like a hammer dropped. The herbal treatment promotes muscle regeneration, ensuring success every time. </p>
<p>For internal hemorrhoids, one should apply the medicinal ointment without contamination from arsenic. Alternatively, the medication may be applied to the rectum directly, or one may wait for the hemorrhoid to resolve itself while applying the medicine daily. As the yellow pus dries, the internal hemorrhoids turn black, and in seven to eight days, the necrotic tissue sloughs off. The herbal treatment helps regenerate the muscle, restoring the intestine as it was before. Even if there is residual heat or toxins, they will be expelled with the feces, leaving no further troubles. This is like removing the blockage from the riverbank; once the flow returns to the center, there are no issues of overflow or stagnation.</p>
<p>Recently, due to specific cases of hemorrhoids and fistulas in the regions of Zhejiang and Quzhou with a focus on medicinal treatments, the thread wrapped in spider silk has also achieved significant results for each sore this way. However, its use is aggressive, causing some distress to witnesses, and I do not dare to be selfish regarding the knowledge acquired. Therefore, I have documented this for the benefit of all, to forever eliminate this affliction.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Treatments for Prolapse (by Wu Kun, Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>For prolapse due to prolonged diarrhea, the formula by Danxi is primary. Prolonged diarrhea injures qi, and excessive bowel movements deplete yin, leading to deficiency in both qi and blood, resulting in the prolapse of the large intestine. To replenish insufficient qi, a sweet and warm approach is taken, hence using ginseng and astragalus; for insufficient yin, nourishment comes from rich flavors, hence employing angelica and cyperus; for prolapse, lifting herbs are used, hence the use of bulbus. </p>
<p>For prolapse from diarrhea due to deficiency of cold and dampness, the Pill to Lift the Anus is recommended. Excess moisture leads to fluid diarrhea, and prolonged diarrhea results in a weak stomach and cold organs, leaving no yang to lift, causing the anus to prolapse. Dryness can eliminate dampness; therefore, pinellia and south star are used; bitterness combats dampness, thus using both red and white alum; warmth can invigorate the organs, hence black and white aconite are employed. Additional ingredients such as celosia, hedgehog skin, and bitter orange peel can disperse wind; myrobalan, wild yam, and walnut shell ash are utilized to solidify the prolapse.</p>
<p>For prolapse due to heat diarrhea, the anal contraction powder is effective. Heat causes the anus to become dry, making bowel movements difficult, leading to prolapse if straining is prolonged. This differs from cold-induced prolapse, where there is a continuous liquid discharge and dryness is absent. Bitterness can counterheat, hence bear bile is used; dryness can solidify the prolapse, so catechu is utilized; spiciness can dispel pathogenic factors, thus borneol is included.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Hemorrhoids and Fistula</strong></p>
<p>For hemorrhoids and bleeding caused by internal heat, the prescription is Four Substances Decoction with the addition of Scutellaria, Berberine, and Sophora flower. Hemorrhoids are a toxin of the intestines. This condition is often seen in the wealthy who indulge in rich foods, while the poorer classes are rarely affected. When a root of the disease exists, thoughts of labor arise, and drinking alcohol becomes frequent, because of the internal heat causing the blood to flow indiscriminately. This prescription includes fresh Rehmannia, Sophora flower, Scutellaria, and Berberine to clear the heat; and Angelica, Peony, and Chuanxiong to regulate the blood. For those advanced in years and weak in vitality, if hemorrhoid bleeding does not stop, the Four Gentlemen Decoction is the prescription. If one hastily takes strong medicine for hemorrhoids, resulting in excessive and unceasing blood loss, and they become weak or faint, this prescription is also indicated. Blood has a tangible yin aspect but must rely on the intangible qi to stabilize it. Thus, in the elderly with weakened qi, blood will flow downward, and prolonged use of strong medicine can damage qi leading to blood flow. This formula includes Ginseng, Atractylodes, Poria, and Licorice, which are sweet and warm tonic substances. When the qi is abundant, it can stabilize the tangible blood. It is likened to a reservoir filled sufficiently between two banks, which can lift the earth without the risk of collapsing.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<p>In ancient prescriptions for treating hemorrhoids that bleed, there are those that use sophora flower, cypress leaves, hedgehog skin, bee nest, ox horn, walnut ash, etc. These are all methods for treating dry hemorrhoids; within decoctions, there are those that use saposhnikovia root, gentian, soapberry seeds, schizonepeta, and angelica; these are aimed at addressing wind-heat entering the internal organs. Some use Glauber&#39;s salt, rhubarb, betel nut, and bitter orange; these address the presence of excess heat that should be purged. Others use coptis, bitter herb, stone lotus flesh, and gourd seeds, which focus on clearing excess heat. There are those who use peach kernel, safflower, cattail pollen, and red sandalwood, which target the blood stasis that has not yet dissipated. Using apricot kernel, flaxseed, rhizome of rehmannia, and berberine, aims at addressing dryness of metal that lacks moisture. There are those who use earthworm, mugwort, calcined dragon bone, and deer antler powder, which seek to staunch the bleeding. Some use ivory, dung beetles, human nails, and crab claws, intending to apply medicine externally to heal. There are methods of fumigation, washing, and sitting with medicine, all of which target stopping bleeding from dry hemorrhoids; those that use insertion of medicine or hanging threads are focused on removing rotten flesh. Alas! To trust a doctor is akin to trusting a general; to use medicine is like employing military strategy. Mastery of warfare involves strategic placement of stones to form a camp or deploying cattle to break the enemy; mastery of medicine involves understanding the heart, which leads to efficacy, recognizing the subtlety that guides the treatment, thus transcending the limits of mere written prescriptions.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>Hemorrhoids are caused by the accumulation of damp heat and overindulgence in grilled foods, or due to prolonged sitting which obstructs blood circulation. They can also be aggravated by emotional distress, excessive exposure to cold, or by lifting heavy burdens and strenuous travel, leading to chaotic energy and blood flow that entangles the meridians. Moreover, excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence can injure the intestines and stomach, leading to stagnant qi and blood that can flow to the anus, resulting in hemorrhoids. This condition affects both young and old, men and women alike. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the anus or protrude outside it. Treatment must address both internal and external factors separately. Larger hemorrhoids may appear like lotus flowers, beehives, flipped flowers, cockscombs, water chestnuts, or corals, while smaller ones may resemble cherry pits, mouse tails, milk, chicken hearts, walnuts, or clam meat. Thus, those with deeper toxins will exhibit irregular and stubborn shapes, while those with lighter toxins will present more regular and typical forms. Over time, they may rupture and leak, while newer ones can cause swelling and sharp pain. In severe cases, feces may escape from the orifice, and blood may flow from the anal opening, resulting in daily damage to qi and blood, gradually affecting one&#39;s appearance. If not treated early, it can cause significant harm.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

For internal hemorrhoids with blood loss, and difficulty in retracting while using the toilet, it is important to strengthen the spleen and elevate the central qi. For blood before and after bowel movements, with a pale-yellow complexion, heart palpitations, and tinnitus, one should nourish the blood and strengthen the spleen. To eradicate hemorrhoids at their root, it is essential to use desiccating medicines to complete the orifice, and one must avoid excessive sexual activity for recovery.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Buttock Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Buttock abscesses arise in the lower abdomen, positioned deep and remote, where the qi and blood rarely flow. They are caused by damp heat pooling and stagnating, which leads to their formation. It is essential for them to manifest externally, so as not to cause internal injury. When they first appear and the poison accumulates from the five organs, there will be identifiable symptoms: the area will feel heavy and dragging, like a stone; internally, there will be dryness and heat in the mouth. One should take internal remedies to dissipate the heat, like &quot;Snow Melting Decoction,&quot; to clear accumulated heat. Externally, apply an ointment to the edges of the wound and use the golden yellow powder to draw out the pus and dark blood, while also taking medicinal herbs for self-healing.</p>
<p>If one takes internal remedies that dispel poison and cold, and applies cooling drugs externally, it can cause the qi and blood to solidify. This prevents the toxic qi from emerging, and instead, will lead to internal injury. If the wound&#39;s edges are soft and sunken without pus, the root is flat and dispersed without pain, and there are internal symptoms of heat, dry mouth, irritability, speaking incoherently, wheezing, and rough breathing—these indicate a poor prognosis. Most cases arise from accumulated poison within, manifesting outwardly; this happens in 80-90% of cases. Only 1-2% result from external influences like wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness penetrating inward. Should there be a recurrence of symptoms returning internally, it will lead to certain death.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At first, there is a feeling of intense cold and body fatigue, a desire to cover oneself with clothing and bedding, and the pulse is floating and tight at the surface; one should disperse it slightly. Once the condition has developed, there is internal heat, dry mouth, a craving for cold drinks, a slight amount of urine, and constipation; one should promote bowel movement. If there is a high forehead, red complexion, painful heat, intermittent pain, one should use herbal formulas to relieve heat and detoxify. If there is swelling that is already high and causes pain, and the pus is mature but has not ruptured, causing intolerable distension and pain, one should promptly use acupuncture. After it has ruptured, if it remains hard and does not heal, with persistent pus and watery discharge, and food loses its taste, one should reinforce and strengthen the spleen.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Prolapse</strong></p>
<p>The large intestine and lungs are interrelated; when there is heat in the lungs, the large intestine becomes dry and constipated. When the lungs are weak, the large intestine may prolapse. This is its essence. Thus, there are cases where prolonged diarrhea or dysentery leads to prolapse due to depletion of qi in the spleen and kidneys. There are also cases caused by coldness and deficiency of central qi, unable to contain and resulting in prolapse. Some may be due to labor and vomiting or diarrhea, harming the liver and spleen, leading to prolapse. Others may stem from dampness from alcohol harming the spleen and sexual desires affecting the kidneys, leading to prolapse. There are cases where kidney qi is fundamentally weak, and the &quot;gate&quot; is not secure, resulting in prolapse. Some may be due to excessive use of cold and coolness, leading to excessive downward movement and loss of yang, causing prolapse. Damp-heat may also cause downward pressure and result in prolapse. However, if there is heat, there must be heat symptoms; if none, it indicates deficiency. Furthermore, qi deficiency is equivalent to yang deficiency; simply using warming supplements may not yield results. This condition is often seen in children with insufficient vital energy. Hence, Chen Ziming remarked: In cases of large intestine deficiency and cold, if qi descends, the anus may protrude. This can also occur from the effort during childbirth. This is a true observation concerning diagnosis. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: For those with prolapse, elevate them. Xu Zhi&#39;s commentary says: &quot;Treatable prolapse can be remedied.&quot; This refers to methods for treating hemorrhoids. Therefore, ancient practitioners often used herbs like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, myrrh, ligusticum, licorice, and buchu to replenish and support the affected areas; sometimes they combined these with northern herbs like five-flavored fruit and wumei to strengthen and solidify the prolapse. Additionally, external remedies for fumigation and washing to manage prolapse will invariably lead to recovery.</p>
<p>For those with a slight deficiency of vital energy leading to prolapse, it is advisable to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction or Five-flavored Dispersal. If there is internal cold with vomiting and diarrhea leading to prolapse, the Five Gentlemen Decoction or Warm Stomach Drink should be used. In cases of persistent diarrhea and slippery prolapse, Stomach Barrier Decoction or additives like wumei, northern five-flavored fruit, clam, and myrrh may be used. If the spleen is deficient and prolapsing, the Supplementing Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction or Lifting Yuan Decoction is prudent. If kidney and liver deficiencies are present with prolapse, a Yin-Supplementing and Qi-Benefiting Decoction is recommended. </p>
<p>If there is a combination of Yin deficiency and Yang deficiency leading to prolapse, a Regulating Yin Decoction or Great Supplementing Yuan Decoction is appropriate. In all the conditions discussed, if there is a deficiency with accompanying heat, redness, or swelling and pain, the Supplementing Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction should be augmented with herbs like huanglian, huangqin, and sophora flower, with modifications as necessary. It is essential to confirm the presence of a true fire condition before applying cold remedies. If it is not true fire, one must avoid bitter and cold treatments to prevent further sinking and damage to the spleen.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Secret Formula for Treating Hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Take five qian of pure white arsenic, twelve qian of pure alum, six qian of yellow realgar, and grind them fine; dry them by water-flying method, twice. Then take eight scorpion tails, dry them on a tile; take two qian of caowu (Aconitum), peel it, and use it raw to make a powder. </p>
<p>Using an old iron spoon or a cooked iron ladle, first heat the ladle until red hot, cool it down, and wipe it clean. Crush the arsenic into bean-sized pieces, bring the alum to a boil, and mix in the crushed arsenic. Using both literary and martial fire, stir continuously and add the caowu, scorpion tails, and yellow realgar to grind into a powder, then store it in a new small bottle. </p>
<p>When using it, first wash the hemorrhoids with licorice soup or scallion soup. Mix a little raw sesame oil with the medicine, and apply it onto the hemorrhoids with a goose feather three times a day. By the first and second days, yellow fluid like glue will surely emerge from the wound, and the hemorrhoids will gradually reduce. </p>
<p>Depending on the depth of the fissure, take three pig bristles wrapped in thin tissue paper, insert them into the fissure to test its depth. Then twist the medicine-coated paper, inserting it into the fissure, and do not remove it for a long time. When changing the paper, take it out and replace it with new twisted paper. Apply medicine three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, and be sure to keep everything clean. </p>
<p>Applying the medicine on the fissure for three to five days, both the fissure and the wound will turn black. Then do not use paper or twists; the root of the fissure will fall off by itself. If the fissure is not deep, apply medication on it. If the wound appears red and does not close, use a wound-healing powder to dress it, and it will heal immediately. The root of the wound will be completely removed, and it will not recur.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Clear water and ointment are used to treat hemorrhoids, protecting the good tissue, followed by a later treatment to wither the hemorrhoids. </p>
<p>Each of the two ingredients, Curcuma and Bletilla, is one tael, and one recipe adds Huanglian.</p>
<p>For the two right ingredients, grind them into a fine powder. If it&#39;s an internal hemorrhoid, wait until sitting on the toilet causes it to protrude, wash well with warm water, lie on the side and it will come out. Use honey water to prepare the mixture well, apply it around the good tissue with a brush, keeping the hemorrhoid outside. Cover the medicine with paper, wait a while, then use the withering medicine to apply on the hemorrhoid, dipping the brush in warm water on the paper to prevent the medicine from drying out or dispersing.</p>
<p>Withering hemorrhoid formula:<br>Four taels of alum, two and a half qian of fresh leadstone, and one qian of cinnabar, ground to an extremely fine powder. Grind the above ingredients finely, first placing the arsenic into a purple clay jar, then cover with the powdered alum, ignite it until the smoke ceases, ensuring the arsenic is completely dissipated with the smoke, utilizing the arsenic vapor from the alum. </p>
<p>With the alum ground to an extremely fine powder, assess the size of the hemorrhoid, taking some alum powder in your palm, adding a little cinnabar and mixing with saliva to achieve a thin consistency. Use the brush to apply the mixture thoroughly over the hemorrhoid three times a day, monitoring for the hemorrhoid&#39;s color to turn dark black as a sign of effectiveness. If yellow fluid emerges by night, do not doubt it; when it is gone, that is excellent. By midnight, apply the medicine once more, continuing the same the next day. Apply the medicine three times even if there is slight pain as that is not a concern.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When changing the medicine, use a bowl to hold new water or warm soup, and lightly wash the old medicine off the hemorrhoids with a brush, then apply the new medicine, while still using the protective ointment. Next, rinse with a Jingjie decoction. After two to three days, when the yellow fluid is about to run out, increase the realgar in the medicine and decrease the alum, which will slow down its potency. Increase or decrease gradually over the next two or three days, taking care to observe any changes in the color of the hemorrhoids, adjusting the thickness and application of the medicine accordingly, as this is the way to handle it effectively. This medicine primarily relies on arsenic for its effect, and the addition of realgar helps resolve it. A practitioner used these two formulas in the capital to treat people with great success, leading to wealth. A wealthy merchant sought it for a hundred pieces of gold, and although I have not used it myself, everyone I pass it on to speaks of its effectiveness. However, the withered herb master Zhao Yizhen has already published it in &quot;The Miscellaneous Compendium of the Green Sack,&quot; achieving remarkable results. The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; has not yet been published. Generally, those who claim to be able to resolve hemorrhoids today refer to this formula. If one fears deficiencies in Qi and blood or internal evils, one should concurrently treat these issues internally to avoid any setbacks.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method for Preparing Medicinal Line at the Recluse’s Chamber</strong></p>
<p>To treat external hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, glandular carbuncles, and perianal abscesses: Take root of the plant <em>yuanhua</em> (Daphne) in any quantity, crush to extract the natural juice. In a bronze cauldron, simmer over low heat until it forms a thick paste. Introduce raw silk thread into the paste, continue to simmer for a long time until the paste thickens adequately. Allow the thread to dry and reserve the paste for future use.</p>
<p>For treating external hemorrhoids with a protrusion, tie the medicinal thread around it and wait for the hemorrhoid to blacken and fall off. Then use the thread wrapped around a pig&#39;s bristle dipped in medicine to insert into the opening, ensuring it does not recur.</p>
<p>For rectal prolapse and the three types of abscesses, regardless of the number of wound openings, select the one nearest the anus. Use <em>malian grass</em> to probe the opening; if a passage leads to the intestine, first take a silver bar bent into shape to gently probe the anal canal, retrieving the grass hook. Prepare a thread about six or seven inches long, making a live loop at one end. Do not knot the thread but instead connect it to the grass, leading it through the large intestine. Then pass the free end of the thread through the loop, allowing it to extend an inch outside, attaching a lead weight of around three or four or five grams to the free end, allowing it to hang freely. This method makes sitting and lying down convenient without sticking to clothing, ensuring quick results.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

If after seven days and the thread has dropped, nearby sores are still wet, it means the intestine is torn, not just at one point, and further sewing is still required. If unable to sew, use a paper twist dipped in powder to apply to the sore until it hurts and bends, doing this three or two times until it opens up for threading. Once the thread has fallen, use a flesh-repairing powder. The silver strip should be double-folded, about three inches long, shaped like an elongated “又”.

The condition resembles a chicken comb, resembling a plum pit or cow milk, whether internal or external, can all be treated. This formula was personally taught to Liu Shuma, who has repeatedly verified its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Burn half a dou of buckwheat until it turns to ash. Cut two-foot lengths of various hard woods like jin chái, old fir branches, mountain white bamboo, and other hard materials, and split them into pieces. Take a bundle of each, let them dry, and burn them into charcoal, which is then placed in a tightly sealed jar to extinguish.</p>
<p>The resulting charcoal is boiled in water to extract the charcoal juice, which is then strained through cloth to ensure no particles come through. Place the buckwheat ash in the strainer and pour the charcoal juice over it. Next, take the liquid from the pot and simmer it on low heat until you have about a small bowl. Let it cool down, add lime and vermilion to make a paste, and store it in a sealed jar, covering it with lime to prevent air from escaping.</p>
<p>When using the ointment, remove the lime and dilute with cold water, instructing the patient to clean the hemorrhoids. The patient should lie on their back, prop up one leg, and first cover the area around the hemorrhoids with wet paper for protection. Then, using a bamboo spatula, apply the medicine directly onto the hemorrhoids. Pain should soon subside; wipe away the excess medicine with paper and reapply. Do this three to four times until the hemorrhoids turn as black as ink. Rinse with water, and daily keep a basin of cool water mixed with scallion soup, washing three to five times a day. After six to seven days, the pus and filth will be completely expelled, and the sores will heal on their own.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

Initially, this ailment may present with itching or pain, with lumps forming around the anus — these are hemorrhoids. If they rupture, it leads to leakage; if there’s only bleeding, it’s intestinal wind. All these result from excess in wine, color, qi, food, and five other causes, leading to this illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Prolapse and diarrhea are governed by Qi.</p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: Feiyang is for the pain from hemorrhoidal injuries. Juegu is for the swelling near anal fistulas.</p>
<p>Tiantu, Zhangmen, Tianchi, and Zhigou govern leakage.</p>
<p>Shangqiu and Fuliu govern post-hemorrhoid blood loss.</p>
<p>Laogong governs hot hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Chengjin, Chengfu, Weizhong, and Yanggu govern hemorrhoidal pain and swelling under the armpit. For long-standing cold-induced hemorrhoids, moxibustion on the back at specific points is recommended.</p>
<p>For hemorrhoidal bleeding with fecal loss, moxibustion at the Huiqi point is beneficial. The acupoint is above the spine at the end of the bones. For illnesses caused by cold leading to prolapse, moxibustion at the navel should be done annually.</p>
<p>If prolapse does not heal over the years, apply moxibustion at the horizontal bones several times, and then at the tailbone as well. The tailbone refers to the last bone of the spine.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers&quot; states: When toxins in the organs initially cause slight swelling, use wet earthworm feces shaped like coins and apply them to the affected area, burning moxa the size of half a bean until it is slightly warm, then remove it. Replace with a new application and repeat as before, for a total of fourteen applications, and use ice fragrance powder for rubbing.</p>
<p>For those with a deficiency, prolapse can occur. Indeed, before the winter solstice, the heavenly forces are extremely cold and heavy, corresponding with the human body, which is a small cosmos: heaven above, humans in the middle, and earth below. Should not the effects be congruent? Treatment may not yield immediate results. As Yang increases after the solstice, and daytime lengthens, Yang gradually grows and Yin diminishes. Moxibustion should be used as treatment; it will be effective for all. Patients should also avoid excessive labor and maintain a calm disposition for the best results.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states: Hemorrhoids occur due to a downward fall of qi and blood, leading to conflicts that cause hemorrhoids. This condition prevents one from sitting or standing, but can be cured by the method of guided movement. The approach is to lie with the head elevated, calm the heart, and regulate the qi; when the qi stabilizes, the swelling will naturally recede.</p>
<p>Another method involves: embracing the feet with both hands, keeping the head still while the feet receive qi towards the mouth, causing the energy at various joints to disperse. One should try to grasp the energy while turning the body sideways, applying pressure on the waist, without moving the limbs. This can alleviate the stagnation of qi and blood in the lower body, relieving the cold blood inside the marrow and the tension that leads to hemorrhoidal swelling and pain.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a method: with the feet together, pressing and kicking towards the lower body, using both hands to hold the knees. Apply pressure quickly and effectively in both directions, followed by moving the waist forward and backward to relieve the stress on the heart and treat hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Another approach involves: sitting with knees together and spreading the feet, maintaining the breathing open, which treats five types of hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Another technique: with one foot on the ground and the other bent at the knee, holding onto the lower legs with both hands and applying strong pressure towards the body, alternating sides four times.

<p>The &quot;Complete Book on Sores&quot; states: A person suffered from hemorrhoids and consumed half a liter of sea snails daily. Due to their salty nature, he rinsed his mouth with bitter tea and consumed up to a dou (approximately 10 liters). He was also able to maintain a calm mind and desire, and thus the hemorrhoids disappeared. Hemorrhoids are associated with the body&#39;s internal heat (yang), while sea snails are cold in nature and salty, fitting the yin. Cold can counteract heat, and salt can soften hardness; bitter tea, being cool, contributes to this logic.</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Teachings on Caring for Parents&quot; mentions: Mr. Zhao Yu frequently suffered from hemorrhoids and used various remedies such as phoenix-eye grass, hedgehog skin, locust roots, and raccoon tails.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Medical Cases of the Xue Family&quot; says: One person, through carelessness in drinking and indulgence, suffered from hemorrhoids with swelling, pain at the anus, blood in the stool, and dry bowel movements. The pulse was large and rapid. Using a decoction of Angelica (Mu Yu) and peach kernels, he improved slightly after four doses. Then, with Si Wu Decoction, plus safflower, peach kernels, Radix Scutellariae, and Sophora flower, he was cured after several doses.</p>
<p>Another person had a chronic case of hemorrhoids; after labor, he suffered from rectal prolapse, swelling, pain, and discharge of pus, with qi deficiency. He took the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with Poria and Peony for over ten doses, restoring his qi and achieving recovery. Later, he had a recurrence with pain, mistakenly took Da Huang pills, leading to abdominal rumbling and aversion to food, nearly putting him in danger. I used the previous decoction with roasted ginger and peony, and he gradually recovered, later replacing ginger with cooked Rehmannia and Schisandra, achieving recovery after over thirty doses.</p>
<p>One individual had a weak spleen and stomach, whether from labor or sexual activity. The anus would descend, with severe swelling and pain. He used the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction, adding Ophiopogon and Schisandra along with Liu Wei pills for recovery. However, after excessive drinking, he experienced descent, swelling, and pain, with symptoms of heat and toxicity. I administered the previous decoction with roasted ginger and Mu Xiang for one dose, then continued with the original decoction, adjusting and adding the Eight Flavor pills; he achieved stability after two months.</p>
<p>A man suffering from hemorrhoids experienced dry and hard stools, pain at the anus, and thirst, with a rapid pulse and a hard abdomen upon palpation. Using the Qin Jiao and Cang Zhu decoction for two doses provided slight relief, followed by a Si Wu Decoction with Scutellaria, Lian Qiao, Sophora flower, and bitter orange, leading to recovery after four doses.</p>
<p>One person developed a leakage from hemorrhoids; each time he used the toilet, he felt pain. With Qin Jiao and Fang Feng decoction and added Radix Scutellariae and bitter orange, he recovered. Adding the Si Wu Decoction with Cimicifuga, Scutellaria, Lian Qiao, and JIng Jie, there was no recurrence.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffering from hemorrhoids experienced pain and protrusion from the anus every time he used the toilet, which would take a long time to recover. After taking several doses of Qin Jiao and Fang Feng Decoction, he felt slightly better. He then added Da Huang along with Huang Qi, Chuan Xiong, and Shao Yao, which halted the pain. After taking over twenty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, he no longer had any protrusion.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from hemorrhoids that were swollen and painful. After taking four doses of Si Wu Decoction with added Qian, Lian, Hong Hua, Tao Ren, and Mu Dan Pi, her pain lessened, and she eventually recovered after a few more doses.</p>
<p>Another woman who had long been afflicted with hemorrhoids would bleed a few drops during heat. She was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus Huang Lian, which cured her. Later, due to excessive strain, she experienced swelling and pain along with continuous menstruation; her pulse was strong but lacked force when pressed. This was due to damage to her blood and qi from overexertion. She was treated with Ba Zhen Decoction plus Qian, Lian, and Pu Huang for two doses, after which her symptoms ceased. Following this, Pu Huang, Qian, and Lian were removed, and Di Gu Pi was added for several doses until she felt stable.</p>
<p>Dan Xi stated that for women suffering from menorrhagia, it is due to damage to the internal organs, causing deficiency in the Chong and Ren meridians. The two meridians are considered the sea of the channels, governing the flow of blood and qi, circulating externally through the meridians and internally nourishing the organs. When qi and blood are balanced, menstruation occurs regularly. However, if one overworks, it can damage the organs and lead to a deficiency in the qi of the Chong and Ren meridians, resulting in sudden menorrhagia, referred to as “sudden flooding.” Treatment should focus on greatly replenishing qi and blood while nourishing the spleen and stomach. A slight addition of remedies to calm and settle heart fire may help the heart, allowing the cycle to normalize.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from hemorrhoids, and every time he went to the toilet, he experienced prolapse for a long time before it returned. His pulse was thin and weak. After administering over thirty doses of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, he no longer had any issues. Danxi said: Prolapse belongs to qi heat, qi deficiency, blood heat, and blood deficiency.</p>
<p>Another man had a condition with discharge from his buttocks, experienced dry mouth and fever, preferred purulent but thin discharge, and had a slow pulse. He was treated with moxibustion on fermented soybean cakes and took the Ba Zhen Decoction with additions of Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Soft Chai Hu, and Di Gu Pi. After more than three months, he recovered. Subsequently, due to carelessness in sexual activity, the condition relapsed, with purulent discharge and a strong pulse. He declined treatment and eventually died. Hejian remarked: If illness leads to deficiency, it is considered light; this is because the illness is still mild and the vital energy is not yet depleted. However, if one overexerts themselves after initial recovery—whether through diet, labor, or sexual activities, leading to depletion—this deficiency becomes severe. The illness has progressed, and the vital energy has already been consumed.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from hemorrhoids, which were swollen and painful, with severe rectal bleeding. His pulse was strong and thin. The text states: If one overeats, the meridians get obstructed and the intestines becomes inflamed, leading to hemorrhoids. This is because wind affects the liver; the liver generates wind, which in turn produces heat. When wind invades, it harms the essence and results in this disease. Therefore, he was treated with a combination of Huanglian (Coptis), Danggui (Angelica Sinensis), Huangqi (Astragalus), Shengdihuang (Rehmannia), Fangfeng (Siler), Zhihua (Bitter Orange Peel), Baizhi (Angelica Dahurica), Chaihu (Bupleurum), Huaihua (Sophora Flower), Diyi (Earth Center), and Gancao (Licorice) to which he gradually improved; subsequently, he took Huanglian pills and was cured. </p>
<p>Another case involved a man named Jiang who had had rectal bleeding for several years and was unresponsive to all medicines. He appeared emaciated and pale, with dim eyesight and dizziness; he was also treated with Huanglian pills and found relief.</p>
<p>Cao Quan, after drinking medicinal wine, experienced anal swelling and pain, with constipation and a firm pulse. He took Jingfang Baidu San but it didn’t work, so I administered Huanglian Neishutang, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man suffering from hemorrhoids had a floating and bounding pulse, experiencing pain and fever in the afternoon. He was treated with Bazhentang (Eight Treasure Decoction), adding Huangqi, Chaihu, and Digupi, which provided slight relief. However, desiring immediate effect, he used harsh medications to exacerbate the condition, resulting in severe pain and leading to his death from refusing food. The ulcer&#39;s healing depends on the flow of qi and blood. A floating and bounding pulse with afternoon pain indicates deficiency of qi and blood. Danxi states: If the wound does not close, use large doses of ginseng, astragalus, poria, angelica, and chuanxiong to replenish it; externally, apply canned aconite and moxibustion, further supplemented with medicated plasters.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over forty had hemorrhoids, with loose bowel movements; after taking Wuling Powder, his condition worsened, and he had little appetite. I suggested he was not suffering from damp toxin, but rather a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and recommended the Lizhong Decoction. He disagreed, continued with Wuling Powder, and became worse. After further consultation, I prescribed Lizhong Decoction and Ershen Pill for over a month, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Li Kui was weakened by his hemorrhoids, so I modified the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, adding a bit of Qiang Huo, Lian Qiao, and Zhi Ke for his treatment, and he improved slightly. Later, he became exceedingly angry during late winter; his pulse was forceful and large. I noted that the pulse did not respond properly to the season, indicating insufficient kidney water with fire overpowering it. Medication could not treat this, and he ultimately died in the month of excessive fire. I often see that those suffering from hemorrhoids exhibit insufficient kidney pulse, making them difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Liu Shang had hemorrhoids with prolapse. This was due to damp heat descending, preventing genuine qi from ascending. Upon examining his pulse, it was indeed weak. I then prescribed Si Junzi Decoction with added Huang Qi, Xiong, Gui, Cang Zhu, Huang Bo, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu, along with a decoction of Wubeizi for topical fumigation. He thought it was a gradual improvement but resorted to caustic poisons like arsenic to eat away at it, which ultimately led to his demise. Medications that specifically target external symptoms can harm one&#39;s true essence and are often detrimental.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from hemorrhoids, and as his qi and blood grew weak, he lost appetite and had difficulty controlling his urination, sometimes experiencing nocturnal emissions. This was due to a deficiency of qi combined with damp heat, not an ulcer. He was treated with Si Jun Zi Tang, supplemented with Shan Zhu Yu, Shan Yao, and Wu Wei Zi, along with a little Dan Huang, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had hemorrhoids with pus and bloody stool. Various medications were ineffective. His pulse was quite strong, so I instructed him to take one pig kidney, cut it open, mix in five grams of black Qian Niu Zi powder, tie it up with thread, and steam it wrapped in lotus leaves until cooked. He was to chew it thoroughly and swallow it with warm salty wine several times, which led to immediate improvement; further supportive treatments were continued until he fully recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a man had hemorrhoids and a dry mouth, with weak stomach pulses. This was due to insufficient middle qi and a deficiency of fluids, preventing upward nourishment. He was treated with Huang Qi Liu Yi Tang and Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. Some said that pains and itchiness from sores were all due to heart fire. They then took bitter cold medications, causing extreme diarrhea and leading to death. It is understood that all pains and itchiness relate to heart fire, which is its normal expression. If heat appears at first and cold ends, that is contrary to the norm, but can one conflate these and remain unaware?</p>
<p>A man had a festering sore on his buttocks that had necrosed, with no new muscle growth. Upon applying medicinal ointments, the surrounding area became hard. Upon examination, his pulse was thin and weak, indicating that his qi and blood were insufficient to nourish the affected area. Thus, the application of cooling herbs caused the area to harden, resulting from qi and blood being congealed by cold rather than any toxicity.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A weak person had an abscess on the buttocks that filled with pus without bursting. After several doses of the Fifteen Complete Nourishing Decoction, it began to rise; then I used acupuncture, and after more than twenty treatments, he was cured. The buttocks are in a secluded position, with little flow of qi and blood. For the elderly and weak, it is essential to tonify qi and blood to ensure recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen buttock, with no change in color, pulse slippery and rapid yet weak; this was an abscess on the buttock with pus likely to form, still internal. I wanted to treat it with external medicines, waiting for the pus to come out before using acupuncture. However, he wished for internal dispersal and took draining medicines, which only worsened his weakness. When he sought treatment again, I returned to the previous method of expelling the pus and used acupuncture, supplemented with tonifying medicines, leading to his recovery. For abscesses that have chronic toxicity sealed inside, the only approach is to nourish the qi and blood to facilitate quicker pus formation and removal by acupuncture; internal dispersal methods should not be considered. Once pus is formed, it is important to differentiate its depth and maturity before acupuncture. If pressing down causes significant pain, the pus is deep; if it causes pain with slight pressure, the pus is shallow; if pressing does not cause much pain, pus has not yet formed; if pressing causes it to rise again, there is pus; if not, there is no pus. If the swelling is high and soft, it arises from blood and vessels; if it is firm and lower, it arises from tendons and bones; if the flesh color remains unchanged, it arises from bone marrow.</p>
<p>Governor Chen Hefeng had a weak spleen and stomach. After taking dispersing and guiding medicines, he developed swelling in his left thigh and buttock. This was due to deficiency of spleen qi causing descent, not an abscess or toxicity. The appropriate remedy would be to excessively augment the qi with Bai Zhu. Confused by popular opinions claiming Bai Zhu can burst pus, he focused solely on dispersing and detoxifying, which exacerbated the swelling and increased his fatigue. I used only Bai Zhu decoction, and it resolved.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man of thirty presented with a pulse resembling a leaking roof with sparrows pecking, accompanied by a hard swelling on the buttocks, a sallow complexion, and clear, thin pus. After administering a remedy to dispel toxicity, I observed that the patient was suffering from significant depletion of the three Yin, exacerbated by the medication. I used a formula of Six Gentlemen combined with a penny of Rehmannia, Astragalus, and Aconite, which led to the swelling softening and the color improving. After reducing the Aconite by half a penny, with several doses, his vitality was restored, and the wound healed.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a hard and painful buttock abscess with a feverish sensation. This indicated a deficiency of Bladder Qi and accumulation of damp heat. I administered Qiang Huo Decoction, with two doses leading to a complete remission of the heat and pain; subsequently, I used a formula to clear toxins, which resulted in the abscess draining; I continued with this formula for over forty doses until it healed.</p>
<p>Yuan Shangshe from Pinghu suffered from hemorrhoids, applying cooling ointment externally and taking detoxifying medicine internally. The issue resolved in the buttocks, producing clear and thin pus, while the pulse was large and rapid, with alternating chills and fever leading to thirst. I declined to treat him, leading to his eventual demise. This indicated a depletion of the three Yin, resulting in a loss of the source of transformation, causing the genuine Qi to become increasingly feeble, which inevitably led to death.</p>
<p>Zhou Xifu, a successful graduate, had a history of hernias and hemorrhoids. He experienced lower abdominal pain when fatigued, with white discharge from the penis and swollen, painful hemorrhoids. If he consumed improper foods or exerted himself, he developed internal heat and cold symptoms along with fatigue. He attempted to treat the root of the illness using medications that attack the disease and promote tissue growth, but his physique became emaciated. I prescribed a Qi-enhancing decoction and Rehmannia pills, which gradually restored his vitality, yet he continued to be unable to fully recover due to his excessive relaxation and lack of regulation.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Aesthetic Grass&quot; says: In the past, a neighbor treated Master Zhang Shouxian, who had long suffered from anal fistula and was greatly drained of qi and blood. There was a recommendation for a good surgeon in our hometown, named Huang, who was skilled in cutting. The master trusted this technique and decided to take all internal medicines to remedy the issue. Unworthy Changya valued the master&#39;s literary and moral stature. In the past, while residing in Yinghai, he once sent disciples to take his pulse and inquire privately about good post-treatment strategies. In essence, he conveyed that after a long struggle with leakage, if one suddenly regains balance, the vital energy will flourish internally, and one could live a hundred years free of worries.</p>
<p>However, in a newly established area, there is still the risk of infiltration; if the organs have been long deficient, the intestines are prone to rupture, creating the possibility of transference. If pure energy has long been stagnant and one has already taken sweet and warming foods to elevate their spirit, yet the leakage persists excessively, the dark consumption of yin blood becomes a concern; if food and water are easily mixed, and nourishing the organs to strengthen the intestines has been employed, but if excessive moistening agents are used, the spleen&#39;s energy could easily dissipate, posing a risk to yins. </p>
<p>Furthermore, since the leakage path connects to the essence passage, if essence slightly overflows, it is bound to seep out sideways. Thus, nurturing essence should be like nurturing a tiger; it should be rich in flavor to nourish the spleen. If the flavor is not properly controlled, it will inevitably lead to leakage, resulting in a lack of benefit for yin. Indeed, the body&#39;s spleen energy prefers dryness and dislikes dampness. Once the leakage path is completed, the spoiling filth descends with no exit; it must inevitably seep into the spleen, exacerbating the dampness. Thus, one should supplement the yang of the spleen, without harming the yin of the spleen, to restore the regular functions and reap the benefits of balance.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When summoned to diagnose in the middle of the month, I lightly touched the pulse and found it strong; pressing harder revealed it to be faint, indicating that the Yang was insufficient while the Yin was severely harmed. Whenever the doctor administered supplements to replenish Yin, the patient would sleep soundly at night, and the intestines would also be loose. This led the ulcer doctor to mistakenly employ the methods of treating intestinal wind and blood loss with sophora and burnet, without realizing the error. In fact, the condition of leakage is a disease of the essence and orifices. When essence is being formed, if Qi is retained, the essence is stopped; if Qi is in motion, the essence leaks. Generally, when one forcefully enters the bedroom, the Qi often surges forth, causing the essence to spill out uncontrollably, flowing through the orifices and frequently overflowing beyond the seminal ducts, eventually forming a leak. Even though the leak may be addressed, the voids within the flesh remain. To fill the orifices and restore the conduits cannot be achieved by such medicinal powers.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a></p></div>

It is said that the only thing capable of filling the deficiencies beneath the jade hall is the pearl on the spotted dragon&#39;s head. Furthermore, the medicines for the various yin conditions are particularly effective at nourishing the lower regions. If not fortified, might the fluids in the intestines become prone to excessive pooling? Yet, this is merely a faint hint of what is needed. A wound doctor is unable to understand and thus has deemed it unusable. I recall a practitioner in my hometown who treated leakage; when an ulcer formed, he applied a method with two divine formulas. First, he administered half a pound of pills, causing the vitality to suddenly diminish, allowing the flesh inside the canal to fill and the outside to become firm. Subsequently, he gave another half pound of pills, reviving the vitality again. Although this method may be suitable for the young, it may not be suitable for the old, yet its intention is indeed remarkable.

Whenever he engaged in drinking, indulgence, or heavy labor, the hemorrhoids would become swollen, hard, and painful, taking over ten days to improve slightly. He wanted to eliminate the root of the problem, so he applied a desiccating powder for hemorrhoids for up to seven days. Gradually, his hemorrhoids turned black, with cracks appearing on the outside. By the sixteenth day, they dried and fell off, resembling a chicken heart. He then used a muscle-replenishing powder daily and took internal medicine to nourish blood and strengthen the spleen, ultimately recovering.</p>
<p>Another man also suffered from hemorrhoids, which caused swelling and pain, and he had dry, hard bowel movements, with a pulse that was rapid and forceful. He took two doses of an internal formula with Huanglian to relieve pain from bowel movements; then he took several doses of a formula containing Qinhua and Zhiqiao to reduce the swelling. He later took a dose of Zanglian pills, and there was no recurrence.</p>
<p>Yet another man had hemorrhoids that would swell and hurt with any exertion. He underwent a steam wash with Zhiqiao decoction and took an internal concoction of Fangfeng and Qinjiao, reducing the pain and swelling after several doses. He was advised to regularly wash with the decoction five to six times a month and to take Liuwei Dihuang pills, adding Huangbo and Zhimu; he did not experience a recurrence.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man enjoyed drinking and had excessive desires, suffering from internal hemorrhoids with blood loss. After taking a decoction of four substances with added herbs—Scutellaria, Lian, Ephedra, and Pueraria—he took it for several doses, and the symptoms subsided. He also took two doses of a decoction with Angelica (and Jujube) and the swelling of the hemorrhoids decreased. Additionally, he took Zanglian pills for over a month, and the rectal bleeding ceased. Over another month, he avoided wine and strong colors, and did not experience a relapse.</p>
<p>Another man had hemorrhoids for over ten years, with the area already ulcerated and unable to pass stool. Each episode caused him great pain. After inserting a specific medicinal probe for seven days, the hemorrhoids turned black, and the edges of the sores gradually cracked. By the fifteenth day, the hemorrhoids fell off. He applied a special soothing ointment for half a month, and the area healed smoothly.</p>
<p>A man who was weak and had internal hemorrhoids with bleeding experienced a pale yellow complexion. He self-medicated with cold-blood-stopping medicines, but they were ineffective. Upon diagnosis, his spleen pulse was weak. The middle Qi was unable to regulate the blood. After taking a tonifying formula for over ten doses, his spirit markedly improved, and the bleeding decreased. He also took an enhanced version of the Four Gentlemen Decoction, alternating with the previous formula, and for over a month, he had no recurrence.</p>
<p>Generally, the causes of such symptoms vary; it is essential to identify the underlying reasons for treatment. For instance, if the vital energy is excessive, leading to dark and stagnant blood, the condition will present as fresh blood followed by feces, but the pulse will be strong. This indicates excess, and cooling and blood-stopping medicines should be effective. Conversely, if the body is thin and weak with a pale complexion, where fresh blood precedes feces and the pulse is weak, this signifies deficiency. It would be inappropriate to use cooling medicines in such cases, as they could harm the spleen and stomach. Therefore, if the symptoms do not warm and strengthen the spleen and uplift the middle Qi, the blood cannot return to normalcy, making effective treatment difficult and damaging the root cause.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a></p></div>

With the administration of two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San, the chills and fever subsided, and the pain eased slightly. As he had pressing official duties, he used a needle to pierce the top of the affected area by about five or six fen, allowing purple blood to flow out.

The Yin and Yang of a person are analogous to the rising of clouds and the falling of rain, connecting the energies of Heaven and Earth.) The Yin flavor emerges from the lower orifice, while the Yang energy emerges from the upper orifice. (Note: Flavor has substance, thus it flows downwards through the portal of excretion. Energy is formless, hence it emerges from the portal of respiration.) **Discussion on the Five Organs** The Gate of the Spirit (Po Men) also functions for the five organs, and water and grains cannot be stored for long. (Note: The Gate of the Spirit refers to the anus. It correlates with the lungs above, thus it is named the Gate of the Spirit. The impurities of the five organs exit from here, making it a lower orifice of the five organs. The filth of the intestines and stomach is expelled from here, hence it is said that water and grains cannot be stored for long.) **Discussion on Vital Energy Connecting to Heaven** Yang energy, when pure, nourishes the spirit; when gentle, nourishes the sinews. If the opening and closing are not regulated, cold energy enters, leading to severe hunching. A sunken pulse indicates a fistula, lingering within the flesh. (Note: Yang energy nourishes the spirit of the five organs internally and promotes the development of tendons and bones externally, having both opening and closing dynamics, both ingress and egress. If the mechanism of opening and closing is lost, cold energy penetrates and diminishes internally. The back represents Yang; if Yang is deficient, cold evils obstruct the back, causing the body to hunch. If Yang is insufficient to uphold the nourishment of blood, the evils sink into the pulse, forming a fistula and lingering between the layers of flesh.)

If one indulges in overeating and excessive strength, this condition manifests. The liver stores blood and governs the tendons, while the food energy enters the stomach, spreading the essence to the liver and the intoxicating energy to the tendons. If the liver is harmed, and one continues to overeat, the food energy cannot disperse, causing the sinews and vessels to become obstructed below. When the food energy stagnates, damp-heat accumulates in the yangming large intestine, resulting in hemorrhoids. The intestines and stomach are interconnected; food that enters the stomach cannot ascend and thus flows back down. As for the strengthening influence of the yang, it solidifies and approaches, not being timely water ice; the transformation into feathers follows. Hemorrhoids and dysentery develop; cold and constriction enter the stomach, leading to internal heart pains. Inside, there are abscesses; hidden curves are unfavorable, mutually attracting the yin aspects. The cold water energy of the greater yang prevails, which is why it solidifies and approaches. The \"not timely water ice\" reflects that this influence existed more than half a year ago, which is why the moths transform later. If the condition relates to the channel of the greater yang, it pertains to those suffering from hemorrhoids and dysentery caused by the cold and hot evils of the greater yang. Constriction entering the stomach is indicative of water overcoming earth. The stomach channels ascend to the heart, hence the heart pain.

The \"Su Wen\" states: Indulging in excessive food leads to the obstruction of the meridians and results in hemorrhoids. Disorders of the organs mainly arise from irregular eating habits, excessive drinking at inappropriate times, indulging in rich and fatty foods, consuming spicy peppers, strong wines, and a variety of meats, being overly indulgent and drunk, indulging in pleasures without moderation, exposure to severe cold or heat, prolonged sitting in damp places, excessively engaging in visual stimuli, and holding in bowel movements for extended periods. These habits cause an imbalance of yin and yang, leading to blockages and the influx of wind and heat, resulting in the emergence of the five types of hemorrhoids. With a disruption in natural order, the public's behavior further deteriorates; now hemorrhoids have developed into twenty-five different categories. They may present on either the left or right side, as internal or external, resembling either mouse milk or cherries, and may manifest as pus or blood, causing pain or itchiness, swelling or hardness. If untreated for long, they may ultimately develop into a chronic condition. The primary treatment involves cooling the blood gradually. One must never use arsenic or toxic drugs, nor should one carelessly resort to surgical removal, as this may lead to chronic sores. There is also a separate channel at the anus, which secretes pus and blood, known as a single leak. For its treatment, one should use warming medicines to nourish the interior and apply restorative ointments externally. Openings in the skin are easier to heal, but those resulting from internal damage are more challenging to treat. Lotus seed hemorrhoids resemble lotus seeds. Connecting intestinal hemorrhoids have their roots inside the organs and incur when defecating. Qi hemorrhoids manifest upon exposure to certain airs.

There are five types of wind-heat hemorrhoids, each with differing symptoms. This is due to the qi of yang being deficient, resulting in a blocked original residence, allowing wind pathogenic factors to invade, leading to the creation of heat. Wind, dampness, and heat attack the intestines, causing the stools to be dry, hot, and obstructed, while blood heat disperses and overflows, soaking the intestines. Thus, the pattern of going to the bathroom first and then bleeding indicates heat is in the lower area, whereas bleeding first and then the bowel movement indicates heat is in the upper area. If it remains unresolved for long, it develops into hemorrhoids. The “Suwen” states: Overeating leads to the loosening of the meridians, causing marital strain and resulting in the intestines to become inflamed, which leads to hemorrhoids. This is because the wind and heat do not disperse, and the food qi overflows, transferring to the lower regions, resulting in swelling at the anus, forming knots as hard as plum or jujube pits; in severe cases, it may even develop into a fistula."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"The five internal organs should be well-maintained and not allowed to be harmed by external evils. The Hand Yangming (Large Intestine) is termed \"harmful to the Flying Insects.\" According to the \"Theory of Six Origins and Proper Organization\": Yangming is the governor of the killing chamber, and the Large Intestine is called harmful to the Flying Insects, indicating that metal can damage the five insects. It also states: the killing chamber signifies that metal governs killing. Given these two names, how can insects arise? This is because the fire of the three energizing compartments is excessive, capable of restraining the Yangming metal, thus wood comes to insult it. The text states: to insult means to overcome oneself; wood governs the birth of the five insects. Shuhe states: Stagnant Qi accumulates next to the spleen, causing the Large Intestine to experience painful spasms that are hard to endure. It is only wise to slightly drain the heat from the three compartments and not to hastily adopt many methods to establish clarity and principles. This means that excessive drinking and consuming hot foods generate great heat in the spleen, thus enhancing the Qi of the three compartments, while fire can generate earth. One should drain the fire and heat from the three compartments so that metal can regain its Qi and counteract wood. When wood is restrained, the five insects will not be born, and the illness will naturally heal. \"Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety\" Regarding proctoptosis (rectal prolapse): When there is severe heat in the Large Intestine, use the water from sour jujube boiled three to five times, slightly warm, to wash three to five times; then apply a bitter remedy to strengthen it, and the condition will improve."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"**Intestinal Pain** The treatment method is the same as above.

The \"Essential Discussion\" states: When the Yang energy is excessive, condensation occurs, not due to seasonal water freezing, producing hemorrhoids and malaria.

The transformation of heat typically affects the back and outer side of the body.

Overeating causes the spleen to be unable to function, causing food to accumulate in the large intestine. When the spleen is weak, the lungs lose nourishment, and the liver becomes timid. Wind pathogens take advantage of this weakness and flow downwards, leading to light cases of intestinal wind and blood, and in severe cases, it transforms into hemorrhoids. Alternatively, becoming drunk and overeating in bed causes the essence and energy to leak, allowing heat and toxins to descend. Or excessive indulgence in bed can damage the muscles, leading to the retention of essence and toxins. In severe cases, this can result in sexual acts between men, injuring the bladder, kidneys, and liver sinews. The bladder meridians connect to the waist, which leads to the kidneys, also runs to the liver, and encircles the front and back yin. Therefore, hemorrhoids are considered a disease of the meridians; when they appear, the face will turn blue, and there will be intense pain, indicating liver distress. **The Five Hemorrhoids:** 1. **Male Hemorrhoid**: resembles a rat's milk near the anus. 2. **Female Hemorrhoid**: a sore forms by the anus that sinks in. 3. **Intestinal Hemorrhoid**: a nodular swelling in the intestines, with prolapse and bleeding. 4. **Blood Hemorrhoid**: bright red blood flows like a thread with bowel movements. 5. **Pulse Hemorrhoid**: frequent passage of blood from the rectum (indicating pain and itchiness).

The reason is that the wind energy connects with the liver, causing the liver to generate wind, which in turn creates heat. When the wind invades, it injures the essence; when the essence is lost, the pathogenic heat harms the liver. Therefore, when one overeats and engages in sexual activity, the muscles and tendons become compromised, resulting in intestinal afflictions and hemorrhoids.

The symptoms may include pain and itching, hardness or softness, pus formation, or none, swelling with difficult bowel movements, or continuous bleeding with stools, and in some cases, perforation leading to blood flowing like a thread.

All these conditions originate from the large intestine, which corresponds to the element of metal (in the Five Elements theory). Its nature is dry, clear, and capable of regulatory action, primarily governing the absorption of fluid, transforming the materials derived from the Earth of the foot Yangming. When in a strong state, it can generate and transform all things, while when weakened, it harms everything. Thus, it is said that all things are born from the Earth and return to the Earth.

It returns to the large intestine, leading to wood overpowering fire and humiliating dry metal. When fire meets dryness, constipation occurs and hemorrhoids develop. Treatment should consist of bitter cold to purge fire, acrid warmth to harmonize blood, moisten dryness, and disperse wind, as well as pain-relieving prescriptions. The \"Spiritual Pivot\" states: the pulse of the foot's sun bladder and its tendons all connect to the waist and influence the kidneys; its branches pass through the buttocks and feet. Therefore, if the tendons are the cause of a disease, this illness may arise. Additionally, the pulse of the foot's jueyin encircles the front and back yin, which can also lead to hemorrhoids. When observing someone affected by hemorrhoids, the initial manifestation is often blue in color and extremely painful, indicating that the liver is in distress. Furthermore, although hemorrhoids and leaking both originate from similar causes, the resulting conditions are indeed different. A hemorrhoid that forms at the edge of the anus and does not rupture is called a hemorrhoid; if it ruptures and discharges pus and blood, with yellow fluid seeping and not stopping for a long time, it is referred to as a leakage.

If the large intestine is dry and hardened, it signifies a condition influenced by fire pathogens. All these ailments arise from the combination of dampness, heat, wind, and dryness. The condition of \"intestine leakage\" refers to blood in the stool. This typically occurs when one does not avoid the toxins of wind, indulges in strong alcohol and roasted foods, and allows emotions of desire and anger to fluctuate, resulting in stagnation in the organs and excess in dietary intake, ultimately harming the gut and leading to disharmony of yin and yang, blockage, and heat toxins descending, causing blood to seep into the large intestine, resulting in leakage and hemorrhoids that cannot be avoided. The classics state: when the muscles and veins are disrupted, and there is intestine leakage as in hemorrhoids, it refers to this. Despite differing names, the source is essentially the same. Generally, the condition of intestine leakage can either be treatable or not. If there is blood in the stool and a cold body, there is hope for survival. If white foam is present in the leakage and the pulse is deep, there is a chance for survival; if the pulse is floating, it is life-threatening.

If one has deficiency, it leads to coldness, and coldness results in a lack of internal energy that cannot hold. Moreover, the large intestine has thickness and thinness, corresponding to the lungs; when the lung organs possess heat, they close, but if they are deficient, prolapse occurs. According to the \"Three Causes\" discourse, women who suffer from this ailment often experience it due to excessive straining during childbirth. For children, this condition results from prolonged diarrhea, stemming from a cold and deficient large intestine. The anus is a continuation of the large intestine; if the large intestine is harmed by obstruction and one strains, the energy descends forcefully, causing the anus to prolapse. One can use herbal decoctions of Xiangfuzi (Cyperus) and Jingjie (Schizonepeta) for washing; or grind Wubeizi (Gallnut) into a fine powder, place it on paper, and gently massage it into the anus. If it persists for a long time, males may develop rectal hemorrhoids, leading to an inability to retract the intestine.

There is also the matter of prolonged diarrhea causing internal deficiency, which can lead to rectal prolapse. If there is itching at the rectum, it indicates the presence of worms in the abdomen, likely due to excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence. The large intestine serves as the pathway for transformation, while the kidneys support strength; thus, if the kidneys are deficient, the vital energy leaks out, causing the lung deficiency, resulting in a lack of control over the large intestine and thus, the prolapse of the anus.

The pathogenesis indeed aligns with the discussions of Dongyuan and Danxi. Generally, for mild cases, one can resolve them by draining water, dispersing dampness, moistening dryness, and soothing wind; all these methods can achieve healing. As for severe cases involving penetrating fistulas and connections in the buttocks, where there may be an egg-shaped tube present for a long time, the method from the \"Yonglei Qianfang\" involving thread treatment is necessary to eradicate the root cause. My colleague Cheng Fuzhai has deeply grasped the essence of this method, truly embodying the principle of pulling out the root and sealing the source, leading to healing without fail. I hereby seek to detail this method and append it for public benefit, hoping it may provide relief to those suffering from this ailment. **Fuzhai's Method for Treating Hemorrhoids** The \"Lun on Vitality\" states: Overeating causes muscle and vessels to become strained, leading to intestinal rupture as hemorrhoids. Dongyuan believes that overeating and exerting force during labor result in the damp-heat of the spleen and stomach, which then exerts pressure on the large intestine causing rupture. It also states that overeating while burdened, difficulties in childbirth, and exertion in young children can likewise lead to intestinal rupture. This is indeed the source of the ailment. Thus, in mild cases, the large intestine is partially ruptured, with damp-heat seeping into the inner and outer layers of the intestine, causing it to descend and form nodules internally. They appear like grapes or lotus seed pods, blocking the passage for excretion, leading to prolapse during defecation, requiring time to retract; this is termed \"turning flowers.\" If due to wind-heat and dry stool, bowel movements become difficult, there can be instances where hemorrhoids rupture before feces are passed, leading to bleeding; similarly, after feces are passed, the hemorrhoids can break, resulting in bleeding. All these conditions stem from internal hemorrhoids."},{"anchor":"trans-46p","marker":"46p","type":"translation","text":"Due to the difficulty in expelling feces, the blood flow differs; thus, there is no consistent principle regarding the distance and timing of blood from intestinal wind. Therefore, when the tear is deep, the large intestine is completely ruptured, and the damp heat qi seeps outside the intestine, lingering in the flesh, flowing laterally outside the anus, forming lumps like cherries, milk, or cockscombs, sometimes connecting to the yin or yang, resulting in abscesses or hanging abscesses; or connecting to the buttocks, leading to buttock abscesses with pus flowing for a long time. Internally, the formations resemble goose tubes and corals, comparable to water in a mountain cave, which, after long dripping, forms stalactites. The branches of the goose tubes proliferate, and the sores are scattered, appearing like a honeycomb or rotten claws, with the skin corroded and flesh sunk, ultimately leading to chronic maladies; all of these stem from external hemorrhoids. Hence, although hemorrhoids can be internal or external, the depths of intestinal tears vary. Those treating the condition do not consider rooting out the source but merely observe that the stool is hard, indicating dryness and heat; after the sores swell, if they become heavy and the intestines form lumps, this indicates dampness and heat; severe pain suggests wind and heat. Parasites erode as wood damages metal; indeed, wood decays first before pests emerge, and once the intestine is ruptured, the poison begins to flow."},{"anchor":"trans-47p","marker":"47p","type":"translation","text":"First, one should establish a proper approach to balance the qi and blood, reduce heat and dispel wind, in order to adjust what is inside; additionally, use arsenic to probe the sores, to rot away the necrotic tissue, in order to treat the outside.

If the affected area is close to the anus, and the necrotic tissue is removed, new flesh in the intestinal head may grow, which is merely a fortunate outcome; however, if the area is remote and difficult to access, even if one uses a rod to probe the anal canal, the area may remain large, causing adjacent sores to heal while the main opening proves hard to close, leading to a recurrence soon after, with the blame falling on the patient.

The time for the thread to fall varies based on the distance from the wound, whether a week or half a month, but it does not exceed two weeks. Once the thread has passed beyond the anus, it falls away like a hammer dropped. The herbal treatment promotes muscle regeneration, ensuring success every time. For internal hemorrhoids, one should apply the medicinal ointment without contamination from arsenic. Alternatively, the medication may be applied to the rectum directly, or one may wait for the hemorrhoid to resolve itself while applying the medicine daily. As the yellow pus dries, the internal hemorrhoids turn black, and in seven to eight days, the necrotic tissue sloughs off. The herbal treatment helps regenerate the muscle, restoring the intestine as it was before. Even if there is residual heat or toxins, they will be expelled with the feces, leaving no further troubles. This is like removing the blockage from the riverbank; once the flow returns to the center, there are no issues of overflow or stagnation. Recently, due to specific cases of hemorrhoids and fistulas in the regions of Zhejiang and Quzhou with a focus on medicinal treatments, the thread wrapped in spider silk has also achieved significant results for each sore this way.

Prolonged diarrhea injures qi, and excessive bowel movements deplete yin, leading to deficiency in both qi and blood, resulting in the prolapse of the large intestine. To replenish insufficient qi, a sweet and warm approach is taken, hence using ginseng and astragalus; for insufficient yin, nourishment comes from rich flavors, hence employing angelica and cyperus; for prolapse, lifting herbs are used, hence the use of bulbus. For prolapse from diarrhea due to deficiency of cold and dampness, the Pill to Lift the Anus is recommended. Excess moisture leads to fluid diarrhea, and prolonged diarrhea results in a weak stomach and cold organs, leaving no yang to lift, causing the anus to prolapse. Dryness can eliminate dampness; therefore, pinellia and south star are used; bitterness combats dampness, thus using both red and white alum; warmth can invigorate the organs, hence black and white aconite are employed. Additional ingredients such as celosia, hedgehog skin, and bitter orange peel can disperse wind; myrobalan, wild yam, and walnut shell ash are utilized to solidify the prolapse. For prolapse due to heat diarrhea, the anal contraction powder is effective. Heat causes the anus to become dry, making bowel movements difficult, leading to prolapse if straining is prolonged. This differs from cold-induced prolapse, where there is a continuous liquid discharge and dryness is absent. Bitterness can counterheat, hence bear bile is used; dryness can solidify the prolapse, so catechu is utilized; spiciness can dispel pathogenic factors, thus borneol is included."},{"anchor":"trans-52p","marker":"52p","type":"translation","text":"**Hemorrhoids and Fistula** For hemorrhoids and bleeding caused by internal heat, the prescription is Four Substances Decoction with the addition of Scutellaria, Berberine, and Sophora flower.

Thus, those with deeper toxins will exhibit irregular and stubborn shapes, while those with lighter toxins will present more regular and typical forms.

When they first appear and the poison accumulates from the five organs, there will be identifiable symptoms: the area will feel heavy and dragging, like a stone; internally, there will be dryness and heat in the mouth. One should take internal remedies to dissipate the heat, like \"Snow Melting Decoction,\" to clear accumulated heat. Externally, apply an ointment to the edges of the wound and use the golden yellow powder to draw out the pus and dark blood, while also taking medicinal herbs for self-healing. If one takes internal remedies that dispel poison and cold, and applies cooling drugs externally, it can cause the qi and blood to solidify.

When the lungs are weak, the large intestine may prolapse. This is its essence. Thus, there are cases where prolonged diarrhea or dysentery leads to prolapse due to depletion of qi in the spleen and kidneys. There are also cases caused by coldness and deficiency of central qi, unable to contain and resulting in prolapse. Some may be due to labor and vomiting or diarrhea, harming the liver and spleen, leading to prolapse. Others may stem from dampness from alcohol harming the spleen and sexual desires affecting the kidneys, leading to prolapse. There are cases where kidney qi is fundamentally weak, and the \"gate\" is not secure, resulting in prolapse. Some may be due to excessive use of cold and coolness, leading to excessive downward movement and loss of yang, causing prolapse. Damp-heat may also cause downward pressure and result in prolapse. However, if there is heat, there must be heat symptoms; if none, it indicates deficiency. Furthermore, qi deficiency is equivalent to yang deficiency; simply using warming supplements may not yield results. This condition is often seen in children with insufficient vital energy. Hence, Chen Ziming remarked: In cases of large intestine deficiency and cold, if qi descends, the anus may protrude. This can also occur from the effort during childbirth.

Cao Quan, after drinking medicinal wine, experienced anal swelling and pain, with constipation and a firm pulse. He took Jingfang Baidu San but it didn’t work, so I administered Huanglian Neishutang, and he recovered. A man suffering from hemorrhoids had a floating and bounding pulse, experiencing pain and fever in the afternoon. He was treated with Bazhentang (Eight Treasure Decoction), adding Huangqi, Chaihu, and Digupi, which provided slight relief. However, desiring immediate effect, he used harsh medications to exacerbate the condition, resulting in severe pain and leading to his death from refusing food. The ulcer's healing depends on the flow of qi and blood. A floating and bounding pulse with afternoon pain indicates deficiency of qi and blood. Danxi states: If the wound does not close, use large doses of ginseng, astragalus, poria, angelica, and chuanxiong to replenish it; externally, apply canned aconite and moxibustion, further supplemented with medicated plasters."},{"anchor":"trans-189p","marker":"189p","type":"translation","text":"A man over forty had hemorrhoids, with loose bowel movements; after taking Wuling Powder, his condition worsened, and he had little appetite.

Li Kui was weakened by his hemorrhoids, so I modified the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, adding a bit of Qiang Huo, Lian Qiao, and Zhi Ke for his treatment, and he improved slightly. Later, he became exceedingly angry during late winter; his pulse was forceful and large. I noted that the pulse did not respond properly to the season, indicating insufficient kidney water with fire overpowering it. Medication could not treat this, and he ultimately died in the month of excessive fire. I often see that those suffering from hemorrhoids exhibit insufficient kidney pulse, making them difficult to treat. Liu Shang had hemorrhoids with prolapse. This was due to damp heat descending, preventing genuine qi from ascending. Upon examining his pulse, it was indeed weak. I then prescribed Si Junzi Decoction with added Huang Qi, Xiong, Gui, Cang Zhu, Huang Bo, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu, along with a decoction of Wubeizi for topical fumigation.

Various medications were ineffective. His pulse was quite strong, so I instructed him to take one pig kidney, cut it open, mix in five grams of black Qian Niu Zi powder, tie it up with thread, and steam it wrapped in lotus leaves until cooked. He was to chew it thoroughly and swallow it with warm salty wine several times, which led to immediate improvement; further supportive treatments were continued until he fully recovered. In another case, a man had hemorrhoids and a dry mouth, with weak stomach pulses. This was due to insufficient middle qi and a deficiency of fluids, preventing upward nourishment. He was treated with Huang Qi Liu Yi Tang and Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. Some said that pains and itchiness from sores were all due to heart fire. They then took bitter cold medications, causing extreme diarrhea and leading to death. It is understood that all pains and itchiness relate to heart fire, which is its normal expression. If heat appears at first and cold ends, that is contrary to the norm, but can one conflate these and remain unaware? A man had a festering sore on his buttocks that had necrosed, with no new muscle growth. Upon applying medicinal ointments, the surrounding area became hard. Upon examination, his pulse was thin and weak, indicating that his qi and blood were insufficient to nourish the affected area.

After several doses of the Fifteen Complete Nourishing Decoction, it began to rise; then I used acupuncture, and after more than twenty treatments, he was cured. The buttocks are in a secluded position, with little flow of qi and blood. For the elderly and weak, it is essential to tonify qi and blood to ensure recovery. A man had a swollen buttock, with no change in color, pulse slippery and rapid yet weak; this was an abscess on the buttock with pus likely to form, still internal. I wanted to treat it with external medicines, waiting for the pus to come out before using acupuncture. However, he wished for internal dispersal and took draining medicines, which only worsened his weakness. When he sought treatment again, I returned to the previous method of expelling the pus and used acupuncture, supplemented with tonifying medicines, leading to his recovery. For abscesses that have chronic toxicity sealed inside, the only approach is to nourish the qi and blood to facilitate quicker pus formation and removal by acupuncture; internal dispersal methods should not be considered. Once pus is formed, it is important to differentiate its depth and maturity before acupuncture. If pressing down causes significant pain, the pus is deep; if it causes pain with slight pressure, the pus is shallow; if pressing does not cause much pain, pus has not yet formed; if pressing causes it to rise again, there is pus; if not, there is no pus. If the swelling is high and soft, it arises from blood and vessels; if it is firm and lower, it arises from tendons and bones; if the flesh color remains unchanged, it arises from bone marrow. Governor Chen Hefeng had a weak spleen and stomach. After taking dispersing and guiding medicines, he developed swelling in his left thigh and buttock. This was due to deficiency of spleen qi causing descent, not an abscess or toxicity. The appropriate remedy would be to excessively augment the qi with Bai Zhu.

The internal swelling subsided, but the area between the hips developed an ulcer; I then used a comprehensive tonic formula, and the wound began to heal. Another scholar had a carbuncle on his hip, with severe swelling and pain. This was caused by a pathogenic toxin. I used a medicinal drink known for life renewal with garlic moxibustion to help disperse it. However, due to subsequent dietary strain and fatigue, the swelling and pain recurred, accompanied by chills and headaches, indicating a deficiency of vital qi that had not yet recovered. I prescribed the same tonic formula and frequently employed a scallion compress method. After two months, he was healed. A man had a carbuncle on his hip, characterized by diffuse swelling and unchanged color. His pulse was slippery and rapid but without strength, indicating an impending formation of pus. I intended to incise it but he was afraid of needles and preferred internal treatment. I mistakenly administered aggressive remedies, which suddenly caused symptoms like severe chills, fever, and spontaneous sweating. I then prescribed the comprehensive tonic formula, and after several doses, the swelling became red and still responded to external needling while continuing to tonify internally, leading to recovery. Wu Fuzhi's father suffered from a carbuncle on his hip with internal ulceration and swelling, fever, dry mouth, and reduced appetite, indicating weakness of the spleen and stomach.

There was a recommendation for a good surgeon in our hometown, named Huang, who was skilled in cutting. The master trusted this technique and decided to take all internal medicines to remedy the issue. Unworthy Changya valued the master's literary and moral stature. In the past, while residing in Yinghai, he once sent disciples to take his pulse and inquire privately about good post-treatment strategies. In essence, he conveyed that after a long struggle with leakage, if one suddenly regains balance, the vital energy will flourish internally, and one could live a hundred years free of worries. However, in a newly established area, there is still the risk of infiltration; if the organs have been long deficient, the intestines are prone to rupture, creating the possibility of transference. If pure energy has long been stagnant and one has already taken sweet and warming foods to elevate their spirit, yet the leakage persists excessively, the dark consumption of yin blood becomes a concern; if food and water are easily mixed, and nourishing the organs to strengthen the intestines has been employed, but if excessive moistening agents are used, the spleen's energy could easily dissipate, posing a risk to yins. Furthermore, since the leakage path connects to the essence passage, if essence slightly overflows, it is bound to seep out sideways. Thus, nurturing essence should be like nurturing a tiger; it should be rich in flavor to nourish the spleen. If the flavor is not properly controlled, it will inevitably lead to leakage, resulting in a lack of benefit for yin. Indeed, the body's spleen energy prefers dryness and dislikes dampness. Once the leakage path is completed, the spoiling filth descends with no exit; it must inevitably seep into the spleen, exacerbating the dampness. Thus, one should supplement the yang of the spleen, without harming the yin of the spleen, to restore the regular functions and reap the benefits of balance."},{"anchor":"trans-196p","marker":"196p","type":"translation","text":"When summoned to diagnose in the middle of the month, I lightly touched the pulse and found it strong; pressing harder revealed it to be faint, indicating that the Yang was insufficient while the Yin was severely harmed. Whenever the doctor administered supplements to replenish Yin, the patient would sleep soundly at night, and the intestines would also be loose. This led the ulcer doctor to mistakenly employ the methods of treating intestinal wind and blood loss with sophora and burnet, without realizing the error. In fact, the condition of leakage is a disease of the essence and orifices. When essence is being formed, if Qi is retained, the essence is stopped; if Qi is in motion, the essence leaks. Generally, when one forcefully enters the bedroom, the Qi often surges forth, causing the essence to spill out uncontrollably, flowing through the orifices and frequently overflowing beyond the seminal ducts, eventually forming a leak.

Furthermore, the medicines for the various yin conditions are particularly effective at nourishing the lower regions. If not fortified, might the fluids in the intestines become prone to excessive pooling? Yet, this is merely a faint hint of what is needed. A wound doctor is unable to understand and thus has deemed it unusable. I recall a practitioner in my hometown who treated leakage; when an ulcer formed, he applied a method with two divine formulas. First, he administered half a pound of pills, causing the vitality to suddenly diminish, allowing the flesh inside the canal to fill and the outside to become firm.

Over another month, he avoided wine and strong colors, and did not experience a relapse. Another man had hemorrhoids for over ten years, with the area already ulcerated and unable to pass stool.

Generally, the causes of such symptoms vary; it is essential to identify the underlying reasons for treatment. For instance, if the vital energy is excessive, leading to dark and stagnant blood, the condition will present as fresh blood followed by feces, but the pulse will be strong. This indicates excess, and cooling and blood-stopping medicines should be effective. Conversely, if the body is thin and weak with a pale complexion, where fresh blood precedes feces and the pulse is weak, this signifies deficiency.
