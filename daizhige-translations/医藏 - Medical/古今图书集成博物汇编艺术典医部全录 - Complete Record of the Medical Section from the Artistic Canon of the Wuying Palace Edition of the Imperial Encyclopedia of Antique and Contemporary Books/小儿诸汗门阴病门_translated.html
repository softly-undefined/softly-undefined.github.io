<p><strong>Sweating in Children</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Instructions for Children</strong> (Song, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Sweating due to joy occurs when the child wears thick clothing and sweats from the forehead; nocturnal sweating happens when the muscles are weak and sweat occurs during sleep, treat it with the Stopping Sweat Powder. General sweating can be treated with the Fragrant Melon Pill. For sweating due to stomach deficiency, which can reach from the neck down to the navel, use the Beneficial Yellow Powder. Sweating from Six Yang Deficiency, affecting from the head down to the neck, is difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The above conditions may arise because a child&#39;s vital energy is not fully developed, leading to loose pores, or due to food stagnation causing heat, or from heavy clothing and warmth leading to internal heat and excessive fluid loss. Joyful sweating pertains to heart heat; use the Guiding Red Powder for blood heat, and if there is blood deficiency, use the Round Ginseng Decoction. Nocturnal sweating concerns the kidney energy; use the Five Flavor Adaptogenic Powder for false heat, and Human Ginseng Nourishing Decoction if there is Qi and blood weakness. If cold water attacks the earth element, use the Beneficial Yellow Powder. If treatments are indiscriminately applied and harm the spleen and stomach, they may lead to digestive issues. Sweating from Six Yang deficiency is a matter of insufficient constitution, though using the Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoctions can help some recover. Generally, excessive sweating leads to loss of Yang, often resulting in arched bow and stiff neck; using the Ten Full and Great Supplementing Decoction can lead to recovery.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Head Sweat</strong></p>
<p>Sweat is the liquid of the heart. Only head sweat does not require treatment. Children have a pure yang body, and the head is where all yang energies converge, with the heart belonging to fire. Head sweat is a sign of heat rising. Thus, head sweat signifies the excess of clear yang and does not need treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweat</strong></p>
<p>Spontaneous sweat continuously emerges, day and night. This is due to both blood and qi being hot, with both the nutritive and protective qi being deficient. The treatment should be Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction. The formula includes Astragalus to replenish the protective qi, Dang Gui and Rehmannia to nourish the nutritive qi, and Scutellaria, Coptis, and Rhizoma Rhei to drain the heat of qi and blood. Floating wheat is used to guide it into the lungs to dissipate the heat in the skin and hair. This is the essential formula for treating all types of sweat.</p>
<p><strong>Night Sweat</strong></p>
<p>Night sweat emerges during dreams and dries up upon waking. Its disease is in the kidneys, and it is advisable to use Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction with a stopping sweat powder for treatment.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Zhong Yang said: When a person experiences night sweats, it indicates that sweating occurs while asleep, suggesting a deficiency in the muscles. The Tuan Shen Decoction treats children&#39;s night sweats and spontaneous sweating. Sometimes, an excess of heart blood can also cause sweating; this medicine helps to consolidate heart energy. Tang&#39;s theory states: Sweat is blood. Blood deficiency can also lead to spontaneous sweating and heat; it is advisable to take Tuan Shen Decoction, Oyster Powder, or Long Dan Decoction to treat all types of children&#39;s night sweats. There is also Tong Shen Pill to treat excessive sweating throughout the body. Young children are often weak in essence and qi, and tend to have excess heat in their nature. If they wear heavy clothing, overconsume hot foods, or suffer from major illnesses that exhaust their fluids, their yang energy may become excessive. When water cannot control fire, internal organs accumulate heat, scorching the bodily tissues. In severe cases, this can even consume the marrow, leading to the disease known as bone heat. If this persists, it can develop into bone steaming, causing fever in the afternoons, emaciation, red cheeks, dry mouth, fluctuating heat both day and night, nocturnal sweats, anxiety in the five hearts, lethargy in the limbs, reduced appetite, and lingering toxins after recovery, which can be treated with Sheng Xi San.</p>
<p>Regarding spontaneous sweating: It is said that infants up to one year old should not experience spontaneous sweating. If they do, it can deplete yang energy, leading to a weak pulse and scattered spirit, potentially provoking wind-stroke. For any spontaneous sweating in infants and young children, do not stop it abruptly. It is advisable to use 2.5 qian of Bai Zhu and a pinch of wheat, boil to dryness, grind the wheat into powder, and decoct with Huang Qi soup to administer, treating until fully recovered. If there is spontaneous sweating due to typhoid fever, it should be treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Long Dan added. In summer, when spontaneous sweating is common, it is appropriate to use Bai Hu Decoction to manage it. In cases of excessive heat leading to spontaneous sweating and wheezing, Ge Gen Huang Lian Huang Qin Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng</strong> 【Ming Wang Kentang】  </p>
<p><strong>Sweat</strong>  </p>
<p>Sweat is the essence stored in the heart; when it is within, it forms blood, and when it is exuded, it becomes sweat. Sweat is the liquid of the heart; thus, when a person&#39;s qi and blood are balanced, they are at peace, but when imbalanced, they suffer from illness. The classics say: when yin is deficient, yang must rise, leading to fever and spontaneous sweating; when yang is deficient, and yin prevails, it causes coldness and spontaneous sweating—both results stem from an imbalance between yin and yang.  </p>
<p>Children have delicate and weak blood and their skin pores are not tightly closed; if they are dressed too warmly, steam will invade their organs, generating heat in the organs that attacks the heart, thus overpowering the fluids, leading to sweat on the skin, known as night sweats. Also, if they are affected by cold or heat, with alternating effects causing disharmony between yin and yang, the fluids might leak out, resulting in sweat during sleep.  </p>
<p>There are indications of deficiency and excess: deficiency refers to conditions after severe sweating, where the blood and qi remain weak, leading to fluid overflow and spontaneous sweating, either with tidal fever or after experiencing cold or heat, resulting in coolness with spontaneous sweating. Over time, this can lead to yellowing and emaciation, and if not treated, it may turn into fever and wasting. DanXi states: night sweats refer to sweating while sleeping; if awake, there is no sweating. When deeply asleep, sweat emerges slowly; upon waking, it stops and does not return, which is also a sign of heart deficiency. It is advisable to conserve heart qi and nourish kidney fluids to harmonize yin and yang, allowing the water and fire to balance, thus stopping the sweating. Qian&#39;s principle states: from the head down to the neck is known as the six yang deficiency sweat, which does not require treatment.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Self-sweating occurs when sweat emerges without waiting for an external prompt. The classics state: when one overeats, sweat arises from the stomach; when startled, sweat comes from the heart; during heavy long journeys, sweat is produced by the kidneys; from rapid running and fear, sweat originates from the liver; from physical strain and labor, sweat issues from the spleen. It is further said: when yin is deficient and yang must respond, sweat arises with heat; when yang is deficient and yin must prevail, sweat appears with symptoms of collapse. Dong Yuan mentioned: for self-sweating due to exterior deficiency, use cinnamon in autumn and winter, and astragalus in spring and summer. Danxi remarked: sweat is the fluid of the heart. There has never been a case of self-sweating that did not arise from deficiency in both the heart and kidneys. The Chao family stated: in deficiency consumption illness, if yang is particularly weak, fluids may leak out as self-sweating. The heart is the primary yang organ, associated with fire. Yang governs yin, and the fluids of the body arise where yang energy is present and leak where fire disturbs; hence, this leads to self-sweating. The treatment should involve ginseng, astragalus, sweet, warm herbs to strengthen yang externally and contain fluids internally, thus stopping the sweat. If the original qi is deficient, in summer, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added yam and cornelian cherry; in winter, add or reduce to Ba Wei Wan or the Ten Complete Vitality Decoction. For blood deficiency, use the Four Substances Decoction with ginseng and astragalus. Those with excess heat should take the Angelica and Six Yellow Decoction.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>For those with both qi and blood deficiency, use Shiquan Dabu Decoction. For heart and kidney deficiency with heat, use Liuwei Dihuang Pills. For deficiency with cold, use Bamei Pills. For heart channel blood deficiency, use Tuan Shen Decoction. For stomach channel qi deficiency, use Liu Junzi Decoction. For dietary fatigue, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. For those who crave sleep and feel fatigued, use Shengyang Yigui Decoction. For heat injuring original qi, use Qingzao Decoction. For summer heat affecting the pericardium, use Qingshu Yiqi Decoction. For external wind evil, use Xingxing Powder. For wasting and emaciation, use Ren Shen Yangrong Decoction. For thinking and worrying damaging the spleen, use Guipi Decoction. For anger stirring liver fire, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. For liver channel deficiency heat, add flavors to Xiao Yao San. For liver channel damp-heat, use Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction. For diarrhea with weak pulse, use Ren Shen Li Zhong Decoction. For sweating in hands and feet, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. For sweating in the chest and abdomen, use Si Junzi Decoction. For sweating specifically from the heart area, use Fuling Buh Xin Decoction. For yellow sweat, use Yinchen Wuling San. For blood sweating, apply Xue Yu San. These are all major methods for dealing with sweating. Additionally, consider the interplay of the five organs. If sweating is like oil, accompanied by incessant wheezing, this indicates a dire situation; if soft sweat is yellow, this indicates spleen failure; if sweat appears without flowing, like pearls, this indicates cessation of sweat. The frequent cases are not treatable. If there is deficiency in all six yangs, sweating will rise to the head and descend to the neck, indicating difficulty in treatment.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Children with spleen deficiency experience spontaneous sweating, often from the forehead, which can cling to hands. Quickly bolster the stomach qi using the whole scorpion powder; prepare a decoction with ginger and jujube for adjustment and also use the sandalwood drink for treatment. </p>
<p>For spleen deficiency leading to spontaneous sweating that is cold all over, this can sometimes occur during diarrhea but may subside without it. After diarrhea, the condition manifests; this situation is one of great deficiency and requires urgent spleen replenishment with remedies like Yi Huang San, Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, and Fuzi Lizhong Decoction.</p>
<p>For lung deficiency characterized by spontaneous sweating, the right side of the face often appears pale and the lung pulse feels weak. This typically arises from prolonged coughing, with persistent sound, minimal phlegm that is not viable, leading to lung meridian deficiency and obstruction of qi which results in sweating. It is advisable to use the Lung Replenishment Powder for treatment, along with the Huoxiang Drink to adjust the spleen, as this also signifies a mother&#39;s intent to care for a child.</p>
<p>In cases of chronic fright leading to spontaneous sweating throughout the body, which feels icy, the condition is dangerous; Golden Liquid Pill and Guozhen Decoction are the primary treatments. </p>
<p>For spontaneous sweating due to an external cause, such as contracting wind evil leading to fever, resulting in intermittent consciousness and profuse sweating, it is important to rescue the exterior and relieve muscle tension using the Baijiesan, brewed in water for consumption; alternatively, the Wuling Powder may be used along with warm white soup for adjustment.</p>
<p>When the stomach is weak and sweating extends from the nape down to the navel, this indicates stomach deficiency and requires stomach supplementation, with Yi Huang San being suitable. For Yang deficiency manifesting as sweating from the nape that does not extend beyond the chest, no treatment is necessary.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>For excessive sweating, when one is heavily clothed and sweating from the forehead, the prescription is the Chih Huan San. Hai Zang states: A child has suffered from night sweats for seven years, and all medicines have been ineffective. I prescribed Liang Ge San and San Huang Wan, and the illness was resolved in three days. The essence of the kidneys transforms into the five bodily fluids, which become the five types of dampness. The upward movement of the fire of the kidney forces the kidney water to ascend, taking advantage of the emptiness of the heart and entering the hand&#39;s Shao Yin. The heart fire is intense and ascends to the lungs, overwhelming them. Consequently, the skin opens, and the pores and original orifices do not close, leading to sweating. Sweating during sleep is termed &quot;night sweats,&quot; as one does not sweat when awake; hence the classic text states: &quot;Night sweat despises wind.&quot; First, use Liang Ge San to drain the fire from the chest; as the fire recedes, the next step is to use San Huang Wan to drain the heart fire to aid the yin, thereby allowing kidney water to return to the original organs, closing the orifices, and stopping the sweating. </p>
<p>For children without illness who sweat profusely while sleeping, feeling as if the body is drenched, and remain wet for a long time after waking, this is termed &quot;accumulated condition of night sweats,&quot; caused by the coldness of the spleen. Use San Ling San, decocted with ginger water, followed by Yi Huang San and Shen Ling Bai Zhu San. </p>
<p>At times, if there is slight cold sweat, especially noticeable at the hair roots like beads, and the forehead and face are moist, this indicates a &quot;startled liver condition.&quot; It is advisable to use Zhen Jing Wan, or Hu Po Bao Long Wan, alongside Fu Shen Tang, adding Ephedra root, to decoct and take for effect.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Night Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When one sleeps, sweat comes out, and when one is awake, it recedes. Qian said: If a child sweats during sleep, it indicates weakness of the muscles and flesh; use the Stop Sweat Powder for treatment. If there is sweating all over the body, use the Perfumed Melon Pill for treatment. If the sweating occurs from the chest down to the navel, it indicates weakness of the stomach; one should tonify the spleen and use the Beneficial Yellow Powder for treatment. Spontaneous sweating belongs to Yang deficiency, while night sweating belongs to Yin deficiency. Yang corresponds to the defensive Qi, and Yin corresponds to the nourishing blood. Blood primarily resides in the heart and is stored in the liver. When heat attacks the heart, fluids cannot be contained within and instead leak out through the skin. When a person sleeps, they are calm and in Yin state; when they awaken, they are active and in Yang state. Hence, we say spontaneous sweating pertains to Yang and night sweating to Yin. This often results from the heart and kidney not communicating, with water and fire unable to harmonize. Kidney deficiency causes loss of containment, leading to this condition. It is advisable to use the Six Flavors Pill or the Perfectly Harmonized tonifying decoction. For blood deficiency with internal heat, use the Angelica and Six Yellow Decoction. If there is heat in the heart channel, use the Red Guiding Powder. For deficiency heat in the liver channel, use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill. For blood loss causing night sweating, use the Angelica Blood-Tonifying Decoction. If there is wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder, use the Chai Hu Clearing Liver Powder. For food accumulation and internal heat, use the Two Aged, Bitter Orange, and Gardenia. For stomach Qi deficiency with heat, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction and Floating Wheat Powder. If both blood and Qi are deficient, use the Ginseng Nourishing Glory Decoction. Other conditions regarding spontaneous sweating should be referred to for further guidance. </p>
<p>If there is sweating that occurs during sleep at night, it is called night sweating, which is caused by Yin deficiency. If it persists for a long time, it can lead to emaciation and weakness, insufficient heart Qi, and excessive loss of body fluids. Use the Poria Decoction with added Astragalus, and take it with jujubes boiled with ginger and salt.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Recipe</strong></p>

<p><strong>Medical Case Studies</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Children&#39;s Direct Prescriptions&quot; states: Zhang’s three sons, the eldest sweated all over and took xianggua pills; the second, whose sweating reached the neck down to the chest, took yiqi powder; the youngest, who only sweated on his forehead, took gypsum soup. All recovered in five days. If one were to generally use wheat decoction powder to treat this, it would be a mistake. </p>
<p>Li Zhan&#39;s &quot;Medical Introductory Text&quot; says: A doctor’s son from Jin had night sweating from infancy to childhood for seven years without any effective treatments. I prescribed Liangge Powder and Sanhuang Pills, and the illness resolved in three days. This is because the kidneys manage the five fluids, transforming them into five types of moisture; when the ministerial fire presses on the kidneys, the kidney water ascends, taking advantage of the heart&#39;s emptiness and entering the small yin channel of the hands, while the heartfire flares upwards into the lungs, overpowering the body, causing the skin and hair to open up, and the pores to be insufficiently closed, leading to excessive sweating. Night sweats occur during sleep because upon waking, they cease. Hence the classic text states: &quot;Night sweats hate wind.&quot; First, use Liangge Powder to drain the ministerial fire from the chest; once the ministerial fire recedes, follow with Sanhuang to drain heartfire to support the yin, allowing the kidney water to return to its primal organ, closing the original orifice, thereby stopping the sweating.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The text from Wan&#39;s &quot;You Ke Fa Hui&quot; states: In this county, a boy aged seven sweated profusely from his head and face. Using a combination of ginseng and angelica, boiled with a pig&#39;s heart to make a soup for him, he was stabilized.</p>
<p>Xue&#39;s &quot;Bao Ying Cuo Yao&quot; mentions: A young child had a complexion varying between pale and bluish, felt cold or hot, had a slightly yellowish-white nose, experienced night sweats, had poor digestion causing reduced appetite, and often felt fearful. I suspected a deficiency of spleen and lung qi but initially had doubts; I then added substances that calm the heart, such as realgar, which exacerbated the symptoms—more instances of fever and cold, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding astragalus and angelica as the main ingredients, along with the Eight Treasure Decoction, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, five years old, had abdominal pain and diarrhea, along with night sweats and a pale right cheek, which indicated a deficiency of spleen and lung qi due to food stagnation. I administered the Six Gentlemen Decoction with hawthorn and sheng ji (digestive agent); the abdominal pain ceased immediately. After removing those two ingredients, I gave another four doses, and bowel movements normalized; with the Four Gentlemen Decoction and a dose of angelica and astragalus, the night sweats ceased.</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old boy was emaciated with a white right cheek, red chin, and a bluish tint around the nose, suffering from prolonged night sweats; these ailments stemmed from a deficiency in the three yin channels. In the morning, I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Six Flavor Pill, achieving recovery.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child had night sweats and poor appetite, and vomited at the smell of medicine; this indicated gastric damage. I ground toasted floating wheat into powder for him to take in small amounts mixed with milk. After about ten days, the vomiting stopped, allowing for the resumption of milk intake, and I supplemented with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>A young child experienced loss of appetite and abdominal pain, accompanied by night sweats. This was due to spleen deficiency and food stagnation. Several doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction were administered, and the abdominal pain gradually improved, with the night sweats also stopping. Later, the child stopped eating again and took a digestive pill, resulting in persistent diarrhea, sweating, and very little appetite. The child slept with eyes open and had spasms in the limbs, indicating deficiency of the spleen and dominance of liver wood. A modified Six Gentlemen Decoction with less Chai Hu was used, and dietary intake gradually increased, leading to gradual improvement of symptoms; however, the night sweats persisted, indicating kidney deficiency, which was treated successfully with Di Huang Pill.</p>
<p>Another child experienced fever, yawning, irritability, grinding teeth, and night sweats, indicating a condition of liver and gallbladder fire. A dose of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added San Zhi was prescribed, followed by Di Huang Pill decoction, leading to recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Prolapse of the Scrotum</strong><br>Prolapse refers to the enlargement of the yin organ falling down and failing to retract. It is treated with concoctions of Mu Tong, Gan Cao, Huang Lian, Dang Gui, and Huang Qin. For prolapse, a powder of Perilla leaves mixed with water is applied topically and wrapped with lotus leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Pediatric Diseases Exposition (Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>(Nèití) Hernia</strong><br>(Nèití) hernia pertains to a condition of the conception vessel and liver meridian, unrelated to the kidneys, caused by cold. If there is swelling without pain, it is termed (Nèití); if there is pain without swelling, it is called hernia; if both swelling and pain are present, it is termed (Nèití) hernia. It is treated with the Zhi Yu Nei Xiao Wan.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Infant Questions</strong> (Ming Dynasty - Ru Bosi)</p>
<p><strong>Swelling and Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi states: The foot&#39;s lesser yin corresponds to the kidney&#39;s meridian, and its energy descends to the yin. When a child has a deficiency of the lesser yin meridian and is exposed to wind evil, the evil energy rushes to the yin and combines with blood energy, resulting in swelling. However, children can differ in size and strength; the onset can vary. If the kidney&#39;s meridian energy is deficient, or if a child sits on a stone and cannot rise, cold energy may become condensed, or if they stay near the ground for a long time, wind and dampness may harm them, it is rare not to experience swelling. Occasionally, there may be crying and anger, which can lead to a buildup at the lower region that doesn&#39;t disperse, compounded by water retention that can also result in this illness. </p>
<p>The treatment involves using Tao Ren pills. If a child has external kidney swelling, a clear solution with finely ground oyster shell powder mixed with egg white is preferable. There is also a type of hernia termed &quot;side descent,&quot; which requires prompt medication. Some children are born with this condition; it may not cause pain and does not necessarily require intervention, as it can heal on its own. If swelling and pain are severe, urgent medication is required, such as Wu Ling powder, Qing Mu Xiang pills, or Tang&#39;s transformational pills, alongside Qi-regulating medications. According to &quot;Jisheng Fang,&quot; powdered peony root and fang feng mixed with wine can be effective. Wu Ling powder combined with fang feng and peony root is also beneficial. If the symptoms are particularly hot, San Huang pills are the treatment of choice.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Summary of Infant Care</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scrotal Swelling and Hernia</strong></p>
<p>In children, scrotal swelling and hernia often result from deficiency of liver and kidney qi, exposure to cold and damp environments, or injury from wind pathogens. It may also be due to blood and qi clashes, excessive crying causing qi reversal, or blocked urinary pathways. Additionally, it can arise from inherited liver channel heat, emotional disturbances during pregnancy, or breastfeeding mothers expressing anger thereby generating liver fire. </p>
<p>If the child has liver channel heat, use Gardenia Clear Liver Powder. For restlessness and anger in the child, apply Harmonizing Qi Powder. If the breastfeeding mother is angry, administer Bupleurum Clear Liver Powder. For liver fire causing qi reversal, use Modified Xiao Yao Powder. If there is abdominal pain and urinary obstruction, utilize Longdancao Decoction to Drain the Liver. If the child sits on a cold surface leading to urinary difficulties, apply Four Ling Powder with added Bupleurum, Cape Jasmine, and Plantago Seed. </p>
<p>For intermittent cold and heat symptoms, use Modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. The classic text states: &quot;When liver qi is hot, it leads to impotence and relaxation of the genitals, swelling of the kidneys, possible discharge of white fluid, abdominal urgency with cramping, or semen leaking during bowel movements; this condition is termed muscular hernia and is associated with liver fire rather than kidney deficiency, necessitating thorough treatment.&quot;<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; (Inner Canon) states: When the kidney pulse is greatly urgent and deep, and the liver pulse is also greatly urgent and deep, both indicate hernia. The heart pulse is slippery and urgent indicates heart hernia, while the lung pulse is deep and thready indicates lung hernia. Hernia is caused by the accumulation of cold qi, resulting in cramping pain around the navel and abdomen. Furthermore, Chao Yuanfang mentioned: All hernias involve the accumulation of yin qi within, which is also harmed by cold qi, leading to an imbalance in the nutritive and defensive qi, with the two qi becoming weak, causing wind and cold to enter the abdomen, thus forming hernia. The &quot;Mai Jing&quot; (Pulse Classic) explains that urgency indicates tightness; when tightness occurs, it corresponds to cold, to solid fullness, and to pain. Blood, when cold, can cause a mass; qi, when cold and stagnant, can cause hernia, all due to the original organ&#39;s qi being deficient, exposed to cold and damp externally, and injured by raw and cold substances internally, resulting in cramping pain around the navel and abdomen, producing urgency and pain without a fixed location, and if it becomes unbearable suddenly, it is termed hernia.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>It is advisable to first use Wuling San, mixing it with hot water for administration to harmonize and relieve. For mild cases, treat with Bai Shao Yao Decoction, Wumei San, or Diao Teng Gao; for severe cases, use Jin Zhu Wan or San Qi Wan, and there has been no case that did not recover. </p>
<p>As for hernia, it occurs when the essence of the yin is obstructed, becoming swollen and painful, often due to children crying in anger, agitating the yin energy, causing it to sink and accumulate without dispersing; or it may be due to a pregnant woman crying excessively, resulting in difficulty for the child during birth, which causes obstruction in the small intestine, leading to this condition. The yin energy fails to circulate, and with the additional intrusion of wind and cold, water accumulates, causing water energy to rise into the lungs, leading to wheezing followed by hernia pain. Its appearance resembles a plum, varying from soft to firm, and can also present as swelling of the kidneys. Pain below the navel is unbearable. One should use medicine to regulate heart qi, expel kidney evil, and facilitate urination without any nourishing method.</p>
<p>For children&#39;s hernias, which may vary in size and fluctuate in severity, one can prepare a decoction of fourteen spiderlings and half a tael of cinnamon twig, making a powder to take eight decagrams twice a day, mixed with alcohol; honey pills are also an option.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Genitals</strong></p>
<p>The swelling of the genitals in children arises from crying and anger that obstructs the flow of energy, leading to an enlargement of the genital area. Furthermore, it can result from an excessive intake of rich and fatty foods, as well as from excessive consumption of cold substances, which leads to the generation of dampness and obstruction of energy, flowing into the genitals. It can also occur due to heat toxins or invasion of wind evils, causing a conflict between blood Qi and evil Qi, resulting in stagnation and formation of swelling.</p>
<p>If the kidney Qi is deficient, or if one sits on stones and does not move, cool air can condense it; or if one is close to the ground for a long time, wind and dampness can cause harm, swelling becomes less likely. Occasionally, if there is crying and anger that becomes blocked in the lower parts, and if fluid circulation is obstructed, it can also lead to this condition. The treatment employs the Peach Kernel Pill.</p>
<p>Danxi stated that if there is a significant hernia, it can fall down and not retract, using the stems and leaves of perilla as a powder, mixed with water and wrapped in lotus leaves. One person transmitted this method, using wild white perilla as powder, applying it wet, or adjusting it with fragrant oil when dry; even when the skin ruptures and the protrusion descends, there are remarkable effects. The use of perilla is similarly effective.</p>
<p>The tendons converge in the genitals; if evil is lodged in the channels of the jueyin and shaoyin and clashes with cool air, then the scrotum can swell and become painful and retracted. Although the classics describe four conditions: large intestine (diarrhea), Qi (dysfunction), water (edema), and ovary (tumor), if children suffer from this condition and are not treated early, it can become a chronic affliction.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>When there is pain in the waist and abdomen, accompanied by cold sweat, and the testicles retract into the abdomen, with pain ceasing only when they emerge, this is termed “internal retraction.” It can be treated with Wumei Powder, Uniform Qi Powder, Jinzhu Pill, and Jinling Powder. </p>
<p>If the penis completely retracts and is not visible, and the scrotum is swollen but not painful, this is due to a deficiency of liver and kidney Qi. It is advisable to prepare a decoction of orange seeds and combine it with Jinling Powder and Uniform Qi Powder, which can be administered. The Inner Canon states: “For those with distended skin or hernias, the yin is excessive, and the pulse is blocked.” Thus, it indicates the excess of yin Qi leading to this condition. </p>
<p>As for retraction, it is caused by tense tendons. When tendons encounter cold, they retract; when they encounter heat, they relax. Therefore, the methods described in “Three Causes” aim to relax the small intestine Qi and disperse wind. However, in children, this condition often arises from sitting on damp, cool surfaces and being exposed to wind and moisture.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Use a decoction of Angelica powder combined with areca nut and Atractylodes, boiled with fresh ginger for internal use, along with a decoction of青木香 and a paste of fishbone twine applied externally. </p>
<p>If there is an external kidney condition causing a large, non-painful, smooth, shiny skin swelling without any apparent cause, this is termed a result of Qi deficiency and should be treated with the harmonizing Qi dispersing method. The &quot;San Yin Fang&quot; recommends the use of Jiuzi pills for this condition. </p>
<p>Another manifestation involves an external kidney swelling that is red, swollen, and translucent, along with swelling of a girl’s vulva, which arises from heart heat transmission. This should be treated with Mugwort and 导赤散. Sometimes, a decoction of Job&#39;s tears may be used to adjust the Wuling powder, and the external dispersing powder can be applied. Additionally, take Tianhua powder boiled with non-ash wine; if unable to drink, a decoction with a little wine can be taken instead. </p>
<p>Zhang Huan said that for children whose Shaoyin meridian is deficient and receive wind pathogens affecting the lower meridians, this results in Yin swelling disease, for which Taoren pills are indicated.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Pediatric hernia, caused by anger and crying, leads to the qi impacting the lower regions, resulting in swelling and hardness of the scrotum. If there is uneven swelling, it is due to qi acting on a weak side. In cases with water retention, the kidneys, which govern water, channel it downward to the outside, also influenced by anger and crying.</p>
<p><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p>Wuteng Pills (from the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot;) treat pediatric hernias with one side swollen and a hardened testicle.

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text: for treating a child&#39;s genital swelling, moxibustion should be performed at the Dazhong point seven times. For treating a child&#39;s qi (weakness), moxibustion should be done on the foot&#39;s Jueyin Dazhong point, with alternating sides, each seven times. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Principles&quot; states that for a child with a congenital hernia and partial swelling of the testicles, moxibustion should be done at the ten cross sutures below the scrotum three times, with efficacy in spring and summer, and efficacy in winter in the spring. For a child&#39;s genital swelling, moxibustion should be performed at the two internal Kunlun points three times, which are located five fen behind the inner ankle, in the cavity between the tendons. The &quot;Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: for a child with a partial descent, have the child sit on the ground, and at noon, perform moxibustion at the point below the partial descent seven times. If the partial descent is not congenital but acquired, moxibustion should be performed seven times above the testicles at the center of the qinzi on the middle line; it will lead to immediate recovery.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Medical Cases</strong></p>
<p>In Wan&#39;s &quot;Pediatric Guidelines&quot; it is stated: A high official&#39;s son in this county suffered from a hernia, with the right testicle swollen to the size of a chicken egg, measuring about five inches in length, extending beside the navel and down to the scrotum. It was hard and painful, and there was an obstruction in urination and defecation, prompting an urgent call for treatment. Two doses of a mixture containing Angelica, Chuanxiong, Mu Xiang, Qingpi, Zhi Mu, Hawthorn, Fennel, Chuan Lian Zi, and Ze Xie were administered, after which he stabilized.</p>
<p>Xue&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Safeguarding Infants&quot; mentions: A young boy had a red, swollen scrotum; I treated him for fetal toxins. After recovery, he experienced symptoms of fever and phlegm accumulation. Diagnosing his mother, who had a history of heat stagnation, I prescribed a modified Guipi and Xiao Yao decoction for both mother and child, and they both recovered. Later, the boy exhibited symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and red, thin urine, with twitching in both eyes. Examining his pulse at the Yin and Mao positions showed redness, indicating wind-heat in the liver meridian. Treatment with Chai Hu Qing Gan San, adding Tian Ma and Equisetum, led to a cure.</p>
<p>Another case involved a boy who had an itchy penis and frequent urination, indicative of liver fire. After administering Wuling San, he developed a neck lump. I then used Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder, along with Si Wei Fei Er pills, which improved his condition; he eventually recovered with the use of Xiaoma Wan.</p>
<p>Lastly, a child presented with penile impotence and damp itchiness, a swollen and painful perineum, and occasional discharge of white fluid. Upon examination, I determined it was liver fire. The treatment consisted of Long Dan Xia Gan Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, which ultimately led to his recovery.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>A young boy experiences testicular pain, red and painful urination, and alternating cold and heat with vomiting. This is a case of hernia of the liver and spleen; it can be treated with Xiao Chaihu Decoction, adding Fructus Gardeniae and Aloe pills to resolve it.</p>
<p>One young boy has itching in the penis; another has ulcers that ooze and are painful and feverish; another experiences painful ulcers in the penis, with constipation and more severe symptoms in the evening; another has itchy eyes with watery discharge, cervical lymph nodes, and scrotal itching, all of these belong to the symptoms of liver heat. They can all be treated successfully with Jiuwu Aloe pills.</p>
<p>A young boy has difficult and delayed urination with swollen and painful scrotum, alternating cold and heat; this indicates damp heat in the liver channel. It can be resolved with Longdancao Decoction. However, if there is also fatigue from internal heat, this indicates a deficiency of spleen qi, which can be treated with Si Junzi Decoction, Chaihu, Fructus Gardeniae, and Angelica Sinensis for recovery.</p>
<p>A young boy has a red and swollen scrotum due to his wet nurse&#39;s anger and drinking. Upon examination, if due to anger, he should take Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder; if due to alcohol, he should take Jiawei Qingwei Powder with added Huoluobat, dried Kudzu, and Massa Fermentata, which he and his mother can take together for recovery.</p>
<p>A young boy with swollen and painful scrotum and red, painful urination can be treated with Jiawei Xiao Chaihu Decoction with Huoluobat, taken by both mother and son to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>A young boy with inherent weakness of liver and kidney has consistently swollen testicles. He can be treated with Liuwei Dihuang Wan plus Chaihu, taken by both mother and son, resulting in recovery in over two months.</p>
<p>Liu Wuku&#39;s son experiences testicular pain, red and painful urination, and alternating cold and heat with vomiting, which can be treated with Xiao Chaihu Decoction plus Fructus Gardeniae, Plantago Seed, and Poria for recovery.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　自汗者，昼夜出不止，此血气俱热，荣卫虚也，宜当归六黄汤主之。其方以黄芪以补其卫，当归、生地黄以补其荣，芩、连、蘗以泻其气血之火，用浮小麦为引入肺，以泻其皮毛之热，此治诸汗之神方也。<br>　　　　　盗汗</p>

<p>　　汗者，心之所藏，在内则为血，发外则为汗。盖汗乃心之液，故人之气血平则宁，偏则病。经云：阴虚阳必凑则发热而自汗，阳虚而阴必乘则发厥而自汗，皆由阴阳偏胜而致也。小儿血气嫩弱，肤腠未密，若厚衣温暖，熏蒸脏腑，脏腑生热，热搏于心，为邪所胜，故液不能内藏，熏出肌肤，则为盗汗也。又或伤于冷热，冷热交争，阴阳不顺。津液走泄，亦令睡中汗自出。其间有虚实之证：虚者谓诸病后大汗后血气尚弱，液溢自汗，或潮热或寒热发过之后，身凉自汗，日久令人黄瘦，失治则变为骨蒸疳劳也。丹溪云：盗汗者，谓睡而汗出也，不睡则不出汗。方其睡熟也，濈濈然出焉，觉则止而不复出矣，亦是心虚，宜敛心气、益肾水，使阴阳调和，水火升降，其汗自止。钱氏云：上至头，下至项，谓之六阳虚汗，不须治之。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　自汗</p>

<p><strong>Sweating in Children</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Instructions for Children</strong> (Song, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Sweating due to joy occurs when the child wears thick clothing and sweats from the forehead; nocturnal sweating happens when the muscles are weak and sweat occurs during sleep, treat it with the Stopping Sweat Powder. General sweating can be treated with the Fragrant Melon Pill. For sweating due to stomach deficiency, which can reach from the neck down to the navel, use the Beneficial Yellow Powder. Sweating from Six Yang Deficiency, affecting from the head down to the neck, is difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The above conditions may arise because a child&#39;s vital energy is not fully developed, leading to loose pores, or due to food stagnation causing heat, or from heavy clothing and warmth leading to internal heat and excessive fluid loss. Joyful sweating pertains to heart heat; use the Guiding Red Powder for blood heat, and if there is blood deficiency, use the Round Ginseng Decoction. Nocturnal sweating concerns the kidney energy; use the Five Flavor Adaptogenic Powder for false heat, and Human Ginseng Nourishing Decoction if there is Qi and blood weakness. If cold water attacks the earth element, use the Beneficial Yellow Powder. If treatments are indiscriminately applied and harm the spleen and stomach, they may lead to digestive issues. Sweating from Six Yang deficiency is a matter of insufficient constitution, though using the Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoctions can help some recover. Generally, excessive sweating leads to loss of Yang, often resulting in arched bow and stiff neck; using the Ten Full and Great Supplementing Decoction can lead to recovery.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Sweat</strong></p>
<p>Sweat is the liquid of the heart. Only head sweat does not require treatment. Children have a pure yang body, and the head is where all yang energies converge, with the heart belonging to fire. Head sweat is a sign of heat rising. Thus, head sweat signifies the excess of clear yang and does not need treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweat</strong></p>
<p>Spontaneous sweat continuously emerges, day and night. This is due to both blood and qi being hot, with both the nutritive and protective qi being deficient. The treatment should be Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction. The formula includes Astragalus to replenish the protective qi, Dang Gui and Rehmannia to nourish the nutritive qi, and Scutellaria, Coptis, and Rhizoma Rhei to drain the heat of qi and blood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhong Yang said: When a person experiences night sweats, it indicates that sweating occurs while asleep, suggesting a deficiency in the muscles. The Tuan Shen Decoction treats children&#39;s night sweats and spontaneous sweating. Sometimes, an excess of heart blood can also cause sweating; this medicine helps to consolidate heart energy. Tang&#39;s theory states: Sweat is blood. Blood deficiency can also lead to spontaneous sweating and heat; it is advisable to take Tuan Shen Decoction, Oyster Powder, or Long Dan Decoction to treat all types of children&#39;s night sweats. There is also Tong Shen Pill to treat excessive sweating throughout the body. Young children are often weak in essence and qi, and tend to have excess heat in their nature. If they wear heavy clothing, overconsume hot foods, or suffer from major illnesses that exhaust their fluids, their yang energy may become excessive. When water cannot control fire, internal organs accumulate heat, scorching the bodily tissues. In severe cases, this can even consume the marrow, leading to the disease known as bone heat. If this persists, it can develop into bone steaming, causing fever in the afternoons, emaciation, red cheeks, dry mouth, fluctuating heat both day and night, nocturnal sweats, anxiety in the five hearts, lethargy in the limbs, reduced appetite, and lingering toxins after recovery, which can be treated with Sheng Xi San.</p>
<p>Regarding spontaneous sweating: It is said that infants up to one year old should not experience spontaneous sweating. If they do, it can deplete yang energy, leading to a weak pulse and scattered spirit, potentially provoking wind-stroke. For any spontaneous sweating in infants and young children, do not stop it abruptly. It is advisable to use 2.5 qian of Bai Zhu and a pinch of wheat, boil to dryness, grind the wheat into powder, and decoct with Huang Qi soup to administer, treating until fully recovered. If there is spontaneous sweating due to typhoid fever, it should be treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Long Dan added. In summer, when spontaneous sweating is common, it is appropriate to use Bai Hu Decoction to manage it. In cases of excessive heat leading to spontaneous sweating and wheezing, Ge Gen Huang Lian Huang Qin Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Sweat</strong>  </p>
<p>Sweat is the essence stored in the heart; when it is within, it forms blood, and when it is exuded, it becomes sweat. Sweat is the liquid of the heart; thus, when a person&#39;s qi and blood are balanced, they are at peace, but when imbalanced, they suffer from illness. The classics say: when yin is deficient, yang must rise, leading to fever and spontaneous sweating; when yang is deficient, and yin prevails, it causes coldness and spontaneous sweating—both results stem from an imbalance between yin and yang.  </p>
<p>Children have delicate and weak blood and their skin pores are not tightly closed; if they are dressed too warmly, steam will invade their organs, generating heat in the organs that attacks the heart, thus overpowering the fluids, leading to sweat on the skin, known as night sweats. Also, if they are affected by cold or heat, with alternating effects causing disharmony between yin and yang, the fluids might leak out, resulting in sweat during sleep.  </p>
<p>There are indications of deficiency and excess: deficiency refers to conditions after severe sweating, where the blood and qi remain weak, leading to fluid overflow and spontaneous sweating, either with tidal fever or after experiencing cold or heat, resulting in coolness with spontaneous sweating. Over time, this can lead to yellowing and emaciation, and if not treated, it may turn into fever and wasting. DanXi states: night sweats refer to sweating while sleeping; if awake, there is no sweating. When deeply asleep, sweat emerges slowly; upon waking, it stops and does not return, which is also a sign of heart deficiency. It is advisable to conserve heart qi and nourish kidney fluids to harmonize yin and yang, allowing the water and fire to balance, thus stopping the sweating. Qian&#39;s principle states: from the head down to the neck is known as the six yang deficiency sweat, which does not require treatment.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Self-sweating occurs when sweat emerges without waiting for an external prompt. The classics state: when one overeats, sweat arises from the stomach; when startled, sweat comes from the heart; during heavy long journeys, sweat is produced by the kidneys; from rapid running and fear, sweat originates from the liver; from physical strain and labor, sweat issues from the spleen. It is further said: when yin is deficient and yang must respond, sweat arises with heat; when yang is deficient and yin must prevail, sweat appears with symptoms of collapse. Dong Yuan mentioned: for self-sweating due to exterior deficiency, use cinnamon in autumn and winter, and astragalus in spring and summer. Danxi remarked: sweat is the fluid of the heart. There has never been a case of self-sweating that did not arise from deficiency in both the heart and kidneys. The Chao family stated: in deficiency consumption illness, if yang is particularly weak, fluids may leak out as self-sweating. The heart is the primary yang organ, associated with fire. Yang governs yin, and the fluids of the body arise where yang energy is present and leak where fire disturbs; hence, this leads to self-sweating. The treatment should involve ginseng, astragalus, sweet, warm herbs to strengthen yang externally and contain fluids internally, thus stopping the sweat. If the original qi is deficient, in summer, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added yam and cornelian cherry; in winter, add or reduce to Ba Wei Wan or the Ten Complete Vitality Decoction. For blood deficiency, use the Four Substances Decoction with ginseng and astragalus. Those with excess heat should take the Angelica and Six Yellow Decoction.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For excessive sweating, when one is heavily clothed and sweating from the forehead, the prescription is the Chih Huan San. Hai Zang states: A child has suffered from night sweats for seven years, and all medicines have been ineffective. I prescribed Liang Ge San and San Huang Wan, and the illness was resolved in three days. The essence of the kidneys transforms into the five bodily fluids, which become the five types of dampness. The upward movement of the fire of the kidney forces the kidney water to ascend, taking advantage of the emptiness of the heart and entering the hand&#39;s Shao Yin. The heart fire is intense and ascends to the lungs, overwhelming them. Consequently, the skin opens, and the pores and original orifices do not close, leading to sweating. Sweating during sleep is termed &quot;night sweats,&quot; as one does not sweat when awake; hence the classic text states: &quot;Night sweat despises wind.&quot; First, use Liang Ge San to drain the fire from the chest; as the fire recedes, the next step is to use San Huang Wan to drain the heart fire to aid the yin, thereby allowing kidney water to return to the original organs, closing the orifices, and stopping the sweating. </p>
<p>For children without illness who sweat profusely while sleeping, feeling as if the body is drenched, and remain wet for a long time after waking, this is termed &quot;accumulated condition of night sweats,&quot; caused by the coldness of the spleen. Use San Ling San, decocted with ginger water, followed by Yi Huang San and Shen Ling Bai Zhu San. </p>
<p>At times, if there is slight cold sweat, especially noticeable at the hair roots like beads, and the forehead and face are moist, this indicates a &quot;startled liver condition.&quot; It is advisable to use Zhen Jing Wan, or Hu Po Bao Long Wan, alongside Fu Shen Tang, adding Ephedra root, to decoct and take for effect.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Night Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When one sleeps, sweat comes out, and when one is awake, it recedes. Qian said: If a child sweats during sleep, it indicates weakness of the muscles and flesh; use the Stop Sweat Powder for treatment. If there is sweating all over the body, use the Perfumed Melon Pill for treatment. If the sweating occurs from the chest down to the navel, it indicates weakness of the stomach; one should tonify the spleen and use the Beneficial Yellow Powder for treatment. Spontaneous sweating belongs to Yang deficiency, while night sweating belongs to Yin deficiency. Yang corresponds to the defensive Qi, and Yin corresponds to the nourishing blood. Blood primarily resides in the heart and is stored in the liver. When heat attacks the heart, fluids cannot be contained within and instead leak out through the skin. When a person sleeps, they are calm and in Yin state; when they awaken, they are active and in Yang state. Hence, we say spontaneous sweating pertains to Yang and night sweating to Yin. This often results from the heart and kidney not communicating, with water and fire unable to harmonize. Kidney deficiency causes loss of containment, leading to this condition. It is advisable to use the Six Flavors Pill or the Perfectly Harmonized tonifying decoction. For blood deficiency with internal heat, use the Angelica and Six Yellow Decoction. If there is heat in the heart channel, use the Red Guiding Powder. For deficiency heat in the liver channel, use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill. For blood loss causing night sweating, use the Angelica Blood-Tonifying Decoction. If there is wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder, use the Chai Hu Clearing Liver Powder. For food accumulation and internal heat, use the Two Aged, Bitter Orange, and Gardenia. For stomach Qi deficiency with heat, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction and Floating Wheat Powder. If both blood and Qi are deficient, use the Ginseng Nourishing Glory Decoction. Other conditions regarding spontaneous sweating should be referred to for further guidance. </p>
<p>If there is sweating that occurs during sleep at night, it is called night sweating, which is caused by Yin deficiency. If it persists for a long time, it can lead to emaciation and weakness, insufficient heart Qi, and excessive loss of body fluids. Use the Poria Decoction with added Astragalus, and take it with jujubes boiled with ginger and salt.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Children’s Night Sweating</strong>: For night sweating in children, use three parts of ephedra root, grind one part of dried fan palm ash into powder, and take three parts mixed with milk, three times a day; also apply three parts of dried ginger. </p>
<p>For children with self-induced night sweating and alternating chills and heat: grind huanglian and chaihu into equal parts, make into honey pills the size of lotus seeds, take one or two pills dissolved in water, add a little wine, and boil in broth for ten to twenty minutes; take warm. </p>
<p><strong>Medical Case Studies</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Children&#39;s Direct Prescriptions&quot; states: Zhang’s three sons, the eldest sweated all over and took xianggua pills; the second, whose sweating reached the neck down to the chest, took yiqi powder; the youngest, who only sweated on his forehead, took gypsum soup. All recovered in five days. If one were to generally use wheat decoction powder to treat this, it would be a mistake. </p>
<p>Li Zhan&#39;s &quot;Medical Introductory Text&quot; says: A doctor’s son from Jin had night sweating from infancy to childhood for seven years without any effective treatments. I prescribed Liangge Powder and Sanhuang Pills, and the illness resolved in three days. This is because the kidneys manage the five fluids, transforming them into five types of moisture; when the ministerial fire presses on the kidneys, the kidney water ascends, taking advantage of the heart&#39;s emptiness and entering the small yin channel of the hands, while the heartfire flares upwards into the lungs, overpowering the body, causing the skin and hair to open up, and the pores to be insufficiently closed, leading to excessive sweating. Night sweats occur during sleep because upon waking, they cease. Hence the classic text states: &quot;Night sweats hate wind.&quot; First, use Liangge Powder to drain the ministerial fire from the chest; once the ministerial fire recedes, follow with Sanhuang to drain heartfire to support the yin, allowing the kidney water to return to its primal organ, closing the original orifice, thereby stopping the sweating.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>Xue&#39;s &quot;Bao Ying Cuo Yao&quot; mentions: A young child had a complexion varying between pale and bluish, felt cold or hot, had a slightly yellowish-white nose, experienced night sweats, had poor digestion causing reduced appetite, and often felt fearful. I suspected a deficiency of spleen and lung qi but initially had doubts; I then added substances that calm the heart, such as realgar, which exacerbated the symptoms—more instances of fever and cold, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding astragalus and angelica as the main ingredients, along with the Eight Treasure Decoction, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, five years old, had abdominal pain and diarrhea, along with night sweats and a pale right cheek, which indicated a deficiency of spleen and lung qi due to food stagnation. I administered the Six Gentlemen Decoction with hawthorn and sheng ji (digestive agent); the abdominal pain ceased immediately. After removing those two ingredients, I gave another four doses, and bowel movements normalized; with the Four Gentlemen Decoction and a dose of angelica and astragalus, the night sweats ceased.</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old boy was emaciated with a white right cheek, red chin, and a bluish tint around the nose, suffering from prolonged night sweats; these ailments stemmed from a deficiency in the three yin channels. In the morning, I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Six Flavor Pill, achieving recovery.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child had night sweats and poor appetite, and vomited at the smell of medicine; this indicated gastric damage. I ground toasted floating wheat into powder for him to take in small amounts mixed with milk. After about ten days, the vomiting stopped, allowing for the resumption of milk intake, and I supplemented with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

Several doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction were administered, and the abdominal pain gradually improved, with the night sweats also stopping. Later, the child stopped eating again and took a digestive pill, resulting in persistent diarrhea, sweating, and very little appetite. The child slept with eyes open and had spasms in the limbs, indicating deficiency of the spleen and dominance of liver wood. A modified Six Gentlemen Decoction with less Chai Hu was used, and dietary intake gradually increased, leading to gradual improvement of symptoms; however, the night sweats persisted, indicating kidney deficiency, which was treated successfully with Di Huang Pill.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Infant Questions</strong> (Ming Dynasty - Ru Bosi)</p>
<p><strong>Swelling and Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi states: The foot&#39;s lesser yin corresponds to the kidney&#39;s meridian, and its energy descends to the yin. When a child has a deficiency of the lesser yin meridian and is exposed to wind evil, the evil energy rushes to the yin and combines with blood energy, resulting in swelling. However, children can differ in size and strength; the onset can vary. If the kidney&#39;s meridian energy is deficient, or if a child sits on a stone and cannot rise, cold energy may become condensed, or if they stay near the ground for a long time, wind and dampness may harm them, it is rare not to experience swelling. Occasionally, there may be crying and anger, which can lead to a buildup at the lower region that doesn&#39;t disperse, compounded by water retention that can also result in this illness. </p>
<p>The treatment involves using Tao Ren pills. If a child has external kidney swelling, a clear solution with finely ground oyster shell powder mixed with egg white is preferable. There is also a type of hernia termed &quot;side descent,&quot; which requires prompt medication. Some children are born with this condition; it may not cause pain and does not necessarily require intervention, as it can heal on its own. If swelling and pain are severe, urgent medication is required, such as Wu Ling powder, Qing Mu Xiang pills, or Tang&#39;s transformational pills, alongside Qi-regulating medications. According to &quot;Jisheng Fang,&quot; powdered peony root and fang feng mixed with wine can be effective. Wu Ling powder combined with fang feng and peony root is also beneficial. If the symptoms are particularly hot, San Huang pills are the treatment of choice.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Summary of Infant Care</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scrotal Swelling and Hernia</strong></p>
<p>In children, scrotal swelling and hernia often result from deficiency of liver and kidney qi, exposure to cold and damp environments, or injury from wind pathogens. It may also be due to blood and qi clashes, excessive crying causing qi reversal, or blocked urinary pathways. Additionally, it can arise from inherited liver channel heat, emotional disturbances during pregnancy, or breastfeeding mothers expressing anger thereby generating liver fire. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; (Inner Canon) states: When the kidney pulse is greatly urgent and deep, and the liver pulse is also greatly urgent and deep, both indicate hernia. The heart pulse is slippery and urgent indicates heart hernia, while the lung pulse is deep and thready indicates lung hernia. Hernia is caused by the accumulation of cold qi, resulting in cramping pain around the navel and abdomen. Furthermore, Chao Yuanfang mentioned: All hernias involve the accumulation of yin qi within, which is also harmed by cold qi, leading to an imbalance in the nutritive and defensive qi, with the two qi becoming weak, causing wind and cold to enter the abdomen, thus forming hernia. The &quot;Mai Jing&quot; (Pulse Classic) explains that urgency indicates tightness; when tightness occurs, it corresponds to cold, to solid fullness, and to pain. Blood, when cold, can cause a mass; qi, when cold and stagnant, can cause hernia, all due to the original organ&#39;s qi being deficient, exposed to cold and damp externally, and injured by raw and cold substances internally, resulting in cramping pain around the navel and abdomen, producing urgency and pain without a fixed location, and if it becomes unbearable suddenly, it is termed hernia.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is advisable to first use Wuling San, mixing it with hot water for administration to harmonize and relieve. For mild cases, treat with Bai Shao Yao Decoction, Wumei San, or Diao Teng Gao; for severe cases, use Jin Zhu Wan or San Qi Wan, and there has been no case that did not recover. </p>
<p>As for hernia, it occurs when the essence of the yin is obstructed, becoming swollen and painful, often due to children crying in anger, agitating the yin energy, causing it to sink and accumulate without dispersing; or it may be due to a pregnant woman crying excessively, resulting in difficulty for the child during birth, which causes obstruction in the small intestine, leading to this condition. The yin energy fails to circulate, and with the additional intrusion of wind and cold, water accumulates, causing water energy to rise into the lungs, leading to wheezing followed by hernia pain. Its appearance resembles a plum, varying from soft to firm, and can also present as swelling of the kidneys. Pain below the navel is unbearable. One should use medicine to regulate heart qi, expel kidney evil, and facilitate urination without any nourishing method.</p>
<p>For children&#39;s hernias, which may vary in size and fluctuate in severity, one can prepare a decoction of fourteen spiderlings and half a tael of cinnamon twig, making a powder to take eight decagrams twice a day, mixed with alcohol; honey pills are also an option.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Swelling of the Genitals</strong></p>
<p>The swelling of the genitals in children arises from crying and anger that obstructs the flow of energy, leading to an enlargement of the genital area. Furthermore, it can result from an excessive intake of rich and fatty foods, as well as from excessive consumption of cold substances, which leads to the generation of dampness and obstruction of energy, flowing into the genitals. It can also occur due to heat toxins or invasion of wind evils, causing a conflict between blood Qi and evil Qi, resulting in stagnation and formation of swelling.</p>
<p>If the kidney Qi is deficient, or if one sits on stones and does not move, cool air can condense it; or if one is close to the ground for a long time, wind and dampness can cause harm, swelling becomes less likely. Occasionally, if there is crying and anger that becomes blocked in the lower parts, and if fluid circulation is obstructed, it can also lead to this condition. The treatment employs the Peach Kernel Pill.</p>
<p>Danxi stated that if there is a significant hernia, it can fall down and not retract, using the stems and leaves of perilla as a powder, mixed with water and wrapped in lotus leaves. One person transmitted this method, using wild white perilla as powder, applying it wet, or adjusting it with fragrant oil when dry; even when the skin ruptures and the protrusion descends, there are remarkable effects. The use of perilla is similarly effective.</p>
<p>The tendons converge in the genitals; if evil is lodged in the channels of the jueyin and shaoyin and clashes with cool air, then the scrotum can swell and become painful and retracted. Although the classics describe four conditions: large intestine (diarrhea), Qi (dysfunction), water (edema), and ovary (tumor), if children suffer from this condition and are not treated early, it can become a chronic affliction.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is pain in the waist and abdomen, accompanied by cold sweat, and the testicles retract into the abdomen, with pain ceasing only when they emerge, this is termed “internal retraction.” It can be treated with Wumei Powder, Uniform Qi Powder, Jinzhu Pill, and Jinling Powder. </p>
<p>If the penis completely retracts and is not visible, and the scrotum is swollen but not painful, this is due to a deficiency of liver and kidney Qi. It is advisable to prepare a decoction of orange seeds and combine it with Jinling Powder and Uniform Qi Powder, which can be administered. The Inner Canon states: “For those with distended skin or hernias, the yin is excessive, and the pulse is blocked.” Thus, it indicates the excess of yin Qi leading to this condition. </p>
<p>As for retraction, it is caused by tense tendons. When tendons encounter cold, they retract; when they encounter heat, they relax. Therefore, the methods described in “Three Causes” aim to relax the small intestine Qi and disperse wind. However, in children, this condition often arises from sitting on damp, cool surfaces and being exposed to wind and moisture.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another manifestation involves an external kidney swelling that is red, swollen, and translucent, along with swelling of a girl’s vulva, which arises from heart heat transmission.

<p>Pediatric hernia, caused by anger and crying, leads to the qi impacting the lower regions, resulting in swelling and hardness of the scrotum.

<p>According to the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text: for treating a child&#39;s genital swelling, moxibustion should be performed at the Dazhong point seven times. For treating a child&#39;s qi (weakness), moxibustion should be done on the foot&#39;s Jueyin Dazhong point, with alternating sides, each seven times. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Principles&quot; states that for a child with a congenital hernia and partial swelling of the testicles, moxibustion should be done at the ten cross sutures below the scrotum three times, with efficacy in spring and summer, and efficacy in winter in the spring. For a child&#39;s genital swelling, moxibustion should be performed at the two internal Kunlun points three times, which are located five fen behind the inner ankle, in the cavity between the tendons. The &quot;Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: for a child with a partial descent, have the child sit on the ground, and at noon, perform moxibustion at the point below the partial descent seven times. If the partial descent is not congenital but acquired, moxibustion should be performed seven times above the testicles at the center of the qinzi on the middle line; it will lead to immediate recovery.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p>In Wan&#39;s &quot;Pediatric Guidelines&quot; it is stated: A high official&#39;s son in this county suffered from a hernia, with the right testicle swollen to the size of a chicken egg, measuring about five inches in length, extending beside the navel and down to the scrotum. It was hard and painful, and there was an obstruction in urination and defecation, prompting an urgent call for treatment. Two doses of a mixture containing Angelica, Chuanxiong, Mu Xiang, Qingpi, Zhi Mu, Hawthorn, Fennel, Chuan Lian Zi, and Ze Xie were administered, after which he stabilized.</p>
<p>Xue&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Safeguarding Infants&quot; mentions: A young boy had a red, swollen scrotum; I treated him for fetal toxins. After recovery, he experienced symptoms of fever and phlegm accumulation. Diagnosing his mother, who had a history of heat stagnation, I prescribed a modified Guipi and Xiao Yao decoction for both mother and child, and they both recovered. Later, the boy exhibited symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and red, thin urine, with twitching in both eyes. Examining his pulse at the Yin and Mao positions showed redness, indicating wind-heat in the liver meridian. Treatment with Chai Hu Qing Gan San, adding Tian Ma and Equisetum, led to a cure.</p>
<p>Another case involved a boy who had an itchy penis and frequent urination, indicative of liver fire. After administering Wuling San, he developed a neck lump. I then used Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder, along with Si Wei Fei Er pills, which improved his condition; he eventually recovered with the use of Xiaoma Wan.</p>
<p>Lastly, a child presented with penile impotence and damp itchiness, a swollen and painful perineum, and occasional discharge of white fluid. Upon examination, I determined it was liver fire. The treatment consisted of Long Dan Xia Gan Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, which ultimately led to his recovery.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

General sweating can be treated with the Fragrant Melon Pill. For sweating due to stomach deficiency, which can reach from the neck down to the navel, use the Beneficial Yellow Powder. Sweating from Six Yang Deficiency, affecting from the head down to the neck, is difficult to treat. **Notes**: The above conditions may arise because a child's vital energy is not fully developed, leading to loose pores, or due to food stagnation causing heat, or from heavy clothing and warmth leading to internal heat and excessive fluid loss. Joyful sweating pertains to heart heat; use the Guiding Red Powder for blood heat, and if there is blood deficiency, use the Round Ginseng Decoction. Nocturnal sweating concerns the kidney energy; use the Five Flavor Adaptogenic Powder for false heat, and Human Ginseng Nourishing Decoction if there is Qi and blood weakness. If cold water attacks the earth element, use the Beneficial Yellow Powder. If treatments are indiscriminately applied and harm the spleen and stomach, they may lead to digestive issues. Sweating from Six Yang deficiency is a matter of insufficient constitution, though using the Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoctions can help some recover. Generally, excessive sweating leads to loss of Yang, often resulting in arched bow and stiff neck; using the Ten Full and Great Supplementing Decoction can lead to recovery."},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"**Head Sweat** Sweat is the liquid of the heart. Only head sweat does not require treatment. Children have a pure yang body, and the head is where all yang energies converge, with the heart belonging to fire. Head sweat is a sign of heat rising. Thus, head sweat signifies the excess of clear yang and does not need treatment. **Spontaneous Sweat** Spontaneous sweat continuously emerges, day and night. This is due to both blood and qi being hot, with both the nutritive and protective qi being deficient. The treatment should be Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction. The formula includes Astragalus to replenish the protective qi, Dang Gui and Rehmannia to nourish the nutritive qi, and Scutellaria, Coptis, and Rhizoma Rhei to drain the heat of qi and blood. Floating wheat is used to guide it into the lungs to dissipate the heat in the skin and hair. This is the essential formula for treating all types of sweat. **Night Sweat** Night sweat emerges during dreams and dries up upon waking. Its disease is in the kidneys, and it is advisable to use Dang Gui Liu Huang Decoction with a stopping sweat powder for treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"Zhong Yang said: When a person experiences night sweats, it indicates that sweating occurs while asleep, suggesting a deficiency in the muscles. The Tuan Shen Decoction treats children's night sweats and spontaneous sweating. Sometimes, an excess of heart blood can also cause sweating; this medicine helps to consolidate heart energy. Tang's theory states: Sweat is blood. Blood deficiency can also lead to spontaneous sweating and heat; it is advisable to take Tuan Shen Decoction, Oyster Powder, or Long Dan Decoction to treat all types of children's night sweats. There is also Tong Shen Pill to treat excessive sweating throughout the body. Young children are often weak in essence and qi, and tend to have excess heat in their nature. If they wear heavy clothing, overconsume hot foods, or suffer from major illnesses that exhaust their fluids, their yang energy may become excessive. When water cannot control fire, internal organs accumulate heat, scorching the bodily tissues. In severe cases, this can even consume the marrow, leading to the disease known as bone heat. If this persists, it can develop into bone steaming, causing fever in the afternoons, emaciation, red cheeks, dry mouth, fluctuating heat both day and night, nocturnal sweats, anxiety in the five hearts, lethargy in the limbs, reduced appetite, and lingering toxins after recovery, which can be treated with Sheng Xi San. Regarding spontaneous sweating: It is said that infants up to one year old should not experience spontaneous sweating. If they do, it can deplete yang energy, leading to a weak pulse and scattered spirit, potentially provoking wind-stroke. For any spontaneous sweating in infants and young children, do not stop it abruptly. It is advisable to use 2.5 qian of Bai Zhu and a pinch of wheat, boil to dryness, grind the wheat into powder, and decoct with Huang Qi soup to administer, treating until fully recovered. If there is spontaneous sweating due to typhoid fever, it should be treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Long Dan added. In summer, when spontaneous sweating is common, it is appropriate to use Bai Hu Decoction to manage it. In cases of excessive heat leading to spontaneous sweating and wheezing, Ge Gen Huang Lian Huang Qin Decoction is recommended."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng** 【Ming Wang Kentang】 **Sweat** Sweat is the essence stored in the heart; when it is within, it forms blood, and when it is exuded, it becomes sweat. Sweat is the liquid of the heart; thus, when a person's qi and blood are balanced, they are at peace, but when imbalanced, they suffer from illness. The classics say: when yin is deficient, yang must rise, leading to fever and spontaneous sweating; when yang is deficient, and yin prevails, it causes coldness and spontaneous sweating—both results stem from an imbalance between yin and yang. Children have delicate and weak blood and their skin pores are not tightly closed; if they are dressed too warmly, steam will invade their organs, generating heat in the organs that attacks the heart, thus overpowering the fluids, leading to sweat on the skin, known as night sweats. Also, if they are affected by cold or heat, with alternating effects causing disharmony between yin and yang, the fluids might leak out, resulting in sweat during sleep. There are indications of deficiency and excess: deficiency refers to conditions after severe sweating, where the blood and qi remain weak, leading to fluid overflow and spontaneous sweating, either with tidal fever or after experiencing cold or heat, resulting in coolness with spontaneous sweating. Over time, this can lead to yellowing and emaciation, and if not treated, it may turn into fever and wasting. DanXi states: night sweats refer to sweating while sleeping; if awake, there is no sweating. When deeply asleep, sweat emerges slowly; upon waking, it stops and does not return, which is also a sign of heart deficiency. It is advisable to conserve heart qi and nourish kidney fluids to harmonize yin and yang, allowing the water and fire to balance, thus stopping the sweating. Qian's principle states: from the head down to the neck is known as the six yang deficiency sweat, which does not require treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"Self-sweating occurs when sweat emerges without waiting for an external prompt. The classics state: when one overeats, sweat arises from the stomach; when startled, sweat comes from the heart; during heavy long journeys, sweat is produced by the kidneys; from rapid running and fear, sweat originates from the liver; from physical strain and labor, sweat issues from the spleen. It is further said: when yin is deficient and yang must respond, sweat arises with heat; when yang is deficient and yin must prevail, sweat appears with symptoms of collapse. Dong Yuan mentioned: for self-sweating due to exterior deficiency, use cinnamon in autumn and winter, and astragalus in spring and summer. Danxi remarked: sweat is the fluid of the heart. There has never been a case of self-sweating that did not arise from deficiency in both the heart and kidneys. The Chao family stated: in deficiency consumption illness, if yang is particularly weak, fluids may leak out as self-sweating. The heart is the primary yang organ, associated with fire. Yang governs yin, and the fluids of the body arise where yang energy is present and leak where fire disturbs; hence, this leads to self-sweating. The treatment should involve ginseng, astragalus, sweet, warm herbs to strengthen yang externally and contain fluids internally, thus stopping the sweat. If the original qi is deficient, in summer, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added yam and cornelian cherry; in winter, add or reduce to Ba Wei Wan or the Ten Complete Vitality Decoction. For blood deficiency, use the Four Substances Decoction with ginseng and astragalus. Those with excess heat should take the Angelica and Six Yellow Decoction."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"For those with both qi and blood deficiency, use Shiquan Dabu Decoction. For heart and kidney deficiency with heat, use Liuwei Dihuang Pills. For deficiency with cold, use Bamei Pills. For heart channel blood deficiency, use Tuan Shen Decoction. For stomach channel qi deficiency, use Liu Junzi Decoction. For dietary fatigue, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. For those who crave sleep and feel fatigued, use Shengyang Yigui Decoction. For heat injuring original qi, use Qingzao Decoction. For summer heat affecting the pericardium, use Qingshu Yiqi Decoction. For external wind evil, use Xingxing Powder. For wasting and emaciation, use Ren Shen Yangrong Decoction. For thinking and worrying damaging the spleen, use Guipi Decoction. For anger stirring liver fire, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. For liver channel deficiency heat, add flavors to Xiao Yao San. For liver channel damp-heat, use Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction. For diarrhea with weak pulse, use Ren Shen Li Zhong Decoction. For sweating in hands and feet, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. For sweating in the chest and abdomen, use Si Junzi Decoction. For sweating specifically from the heart area, use Fuling Buh Xin Decoction. For yellow sweat, use Yinchen Wuling San. For blood sweating, apply Xue Yu San. These are all major methods for dealing with sweating. Additionally, consider the interplay of the five organs. If sweating is like oil, accompanied by incessant wheezing, this indicates a dire situation; if soft sweat is yellow, this indicates spleen failure; if sweat appears without flowing, like pearls, this indicates cessation of sweat. The frequent cases are not treatable. If there is deficiency in all six yangs, sweating will rise to the head and descend to the neck, indicating difficulty in treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"Children with spleen deficiency experience spontaneous sweating, often from the forehead, which can cling to hands. Quickly bolster the stomach qi using the whole scorpion powder; prepare a decoction with ginger and jujube for adjustment and also use the sandalwood drink for treatment. For spleen deficiency leading to spontaneous sweating that is cold all over, this can sometimes occur during diarrhea but may subside without it. After diarrhea, the condition manifests; this situation is one of great deficiency and requires urgent spleen replenishment with remedies like Yi Huang San, Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, and Fuzi Lizhong Decoction. For lung deficiency characterized by spontaneous sweating, the right side of the face often appears pale and the lung pulse feels weak. This typically arises from prolonged coughing, with persistent sound, minimal phlegm that is not viable, leading to lung meridian deficiency and obstruction of qi which results in sweating. It is advisable to use the Lung Replenishment Powder for treatment, along with the Huoxiang Drink to adjust the spleen, as this also signifies a mother's intent to care for a child. In cases of chronic fright leading to spontaneous sweating throughout the body, which feels icy, the condition is dangerous; Golden Liquid Pill and Guozhen Decoction are the primary treatments. For spontaneous sweating due to an external cause, such as contracting wind evil leading to fever, resulting in intermittent consciousness and profuse sweating, it is important to rescue the exterior and relieve muscle tension using the Baijiesan, brewed in water for consumption; alternatively, the Wuling Powder may be used along with warm white soup for adjustment. When the stomach is weak and sweating extends from the nape down to the navel, this indicates stomach deficiency and requires stomach supplementation, with Yi Huang San being suitable. For Yang deficiency manifesting as sweating from the nape that does not extend beyond the chest, no treatment is necessary."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"For excessive sweating, when one is heavily clothed and sweating from the forehead, the prescription is the Chih Huan San. Hai Zang states: A child has suffered from night sweats for seven years, and all medicines have been ineffective. I prescribed Liang Ge San and San Huang Wan, and the illness was resolved in three days. The essence of the kidneys transforms into the five bodily fluids, which become the five types of dampness. The upward movement of the fire of the kidney forces the kidney water to ascend, taking advantage of the emptiness of the heart and entering the hand's Shao Yin. The heart fire is intense and ascends to the lungs, overwhelming them. Consequently, the skin opens, and the pores and original orifices do not close, leading to sweating. Sweating during sleep is termed \"night sweats,\" as one does not sweat when awake; hence the classic text states: \"Night sweat despises wind.\" First, use Liang Ge San to drain the fire from the chest; as the fire recedes, the next step is to use San Huang Wan to drain the heart fire to aid the yin, thereby allowing kidney water to return to the original organs, closing the orifices, and stopping the sweating. For children without illness who sweat profusely while sleeping, feeling as if the body is drenched, and remain wet for a long time after waking, this is termed \"accumulated condition of night sweats,\" caused by the coldness of the spleen. Use San Ling San, decocted with ginger water, followed by Yi Huang San and Shen Ling Bai Zhu San. At times, if there is slight cold sweat, especially noticeable at the hair roots like beads, and the forehead and face are moist, this indicates a \"startled liver condition.\" It is advisable to use Zhen Jing Wan, or Hu Po Bao Long Wan, alongside Fu Shen Tang, adding Ephedra root, to decoct and take for effect."},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"**Night Sweating** When one sleeps, sweat comes out, and when one is awake, it recedes. Qian said: If a child sweats during sleep, it indicates weakness of the muscles and flesh; use the Stop Sweat Powder for treatment. If there is sweating all over the body, use the Perfumed Melon Pill for treatment. If the sweating occurs from the chest down to the navel, it indicates weakness of the stomach; one should tonify the spleen and use the Beneficial Yellow Powder for treatment. Spontaneous sweating belongs to Yang deficiency, while night sweating belongs to Yin deficiency. Yang corresponds to the defensive Qi, and Yin corresponds to the nourishing blood. Blood primarily resides in the heart and is stored in the liver. When heat attacks the heart, fluids cannot be contained within and instead leak out through the skin. When a person sleeps, they are calm and in Yin state; when they awaken, they are active and in Yang state. Hence, we say spontaneous sweating pertains to Yang and night sweating to Yin. This often results from the heart and kidney not communicating, with water and fire unable to harmonize. Kidney deficiency causes loss of containment, leading to this condition. It is advisable to use the Six Flavors Pill or the Perfectly Harmonized tonifying decoction. For blood deficiency with internal heat, use the Angelica and Six Yellow Decoction. If there is heat in the heart channel, use the Red Guiding Powder. For deficiency heat in the liver channel, use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill. For blood loss causing night sweating, use the Angelica Blood-Tonifying Decoction. If there is wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder, use the Chai Hu Clearing Liver Powder. For food accumulation and internal heat, use the Two Aged, Bitter Orange, and Gardenia. For stomach Qi deficiency with heat, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction and Floating Wheat Powder. If both blood and Qi are deficient, use the Ginseng Nourishing Glory Decoction. Other conditions regarding spontaneous sweating should be referred to for further guidance. If there is sweating that occurs during sleep at night, it is called night sweating, which is caused by Yin deficiency. If it persists for a long time, it can lead to emaciation and weakness, insufficient heart Qi, and excessive loss of body fluids.

Li Zhan's \"Medical Introductory Text\" says: A doctor’s son from Jin had night sweating from infancy to childhood for seven years without any effective treatments. I prescribed Liangge Powder and Sanhuang Pills, and the illness resolved in three days. This is because the kidneys manage the five fluids, transforming them into five types of moisture; when the ministerial fire presses on the kidneys, the kidney water ascends, taking advantage of the heart's emptiness and entering the small yin channel of the hands, while the heartfire flares upwards into the lungs, overpowering the body, causing the skin and hair to open up, and the pores to be insufficiently closed, leading to excessive sweating. Night sweats occur during sleep because upon waking, they cease. Hence the classic text states: \"Night sweats hate wind.\" First, use Liangge Powder to drain the ministerial fire from the chest; once the ministerial fire recedes, follow with Sanhuang to drain heartfire to support the yin, allowing the kidney water to return to its primal organ, closing the original orifice, thereby stopping the sweating."},{"anchor":"trans-17p","marker":"17p","type":"translation","text":"The text from Wan's \"You Ke Fa Hui\" states: In this county, a boy aged seven sweated profusely from his head and face.

I suspected a deficiency of spleen and lung qi but initially had doubts; I then added substances that calm the heart, such as realgar, which exacerbated the symptoms—more instances of fever and cold, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding astragalus and angelica as the main ingredients, along with the Eight Treasure Decoction, resulting in recovery. Another child, five years old, had abdominal pain and diarrhea, along with night sweats and a pale right cheek, which indicated a deficiency of spleen and lung qi due to food stagnation. I administered the Six Gentlemen Decoction with hawthorn and sheng ji (digestive agent); the abdominal pain ceased immediately. After removing those two ingredients, I gave another four doses, and bowel movements normalized; with the Four Gentlemen Decoction and a dose of angelica and astragalus, the night sweats ceased. A twelve-year-old boy was emaciated with a white right cheek, red chin, and a bluish tint around the nose, suffering from prolonged night sweats; these ailments stemmed from a deficiency in the three yin channels.

When a child has a deficiency of the lesser yin meridian and is exposed to wind evil, the evil energy rushes to the yin and combines with blood energy, resulting in swelling. However, children can differ in size and strength; the onset can vary. If the kidney's meridian energy is deficient, or if a child sits on a stone and cannot rise, cold energy may become condensed, or if they stay near the ground for a long time, wind and dampness may harm them, it is rare not to experience swelling. Occasionally, there may be crying and anger, which can lead to a buildup at the lower region that doesn't disperse, compounded by water retention that can also result in this illness. The treatment involves using Tao Ren pills. If a child has external kidney swelling, a clear solution with finely ground oyster shell powder mixed with egg white is preferable. There is also a type of hernia termed \"side descent,\" which requires prompt medication. Some children are born with this condition; it may not cause pain and does not necessarily require intervention, as it can heal on its own.

Additionally, it can arise from inherited liver channel heat, emotional disturbances during pregnancy, or breastfeeding mothers expressing anger thereby generating liver fire. If the child has liver channel heat, use Gardenia Clear Liver Powder. For restlessness and anger in the child, apply Harmonizing Qi Powder.

Hernia is caused by the accumulation of cold qi, resulting in cramping pain around the navel and abdomen. Furthermore, Chao Yuanfang mentioned: All hernias involve the accumulation of yin qi within, which is also harmed by cold qi, leading to an imbalance in the nutritive and defensive qi, with the two qi becoming weak, causing wind and cold to enter the abdomen, thus forming hernia. The \"Mai Jing\" (Pulse Classic) explains that urgency indicates tightness; when tightness occurs, it corresponds to cold, to solid fullness, and to pain. Blood, when cold, can cause a mass; qi, when cold and stagnant, can cause hernia, all due to the original organ's qi being deficient, exposed to cold and damp externally, and injured by raw and cold substances internally, resulting in cramping pain around the navel and abdomen, producing urgency and pain without a fixed location, and if it becomes unbearable suddenly, it is termed hernia."},{"anchor":"trans-22p","marker":"22p","type":"translation","text":"It is advisable to first use Wuling San, mixing it with hot water for administration to harmonize and relieve.

As for hernia, it occurs when the essence of the yin is obstructed, becoming swollen and painful, often due to children crying in anger, agitating the yin energy, causing it to sink and accumulate without dispersing; or it may be due to a pregnant woman crying excessively, resulting in difficulty for the child during birth, which causes obstruction in the small intestine, leading to this condition. The yin energy fails to circulate, and with the additional intrusion of wind and cold, water accumulates, causing water energy to rise into the lungs, leading to wheezing followed by hernia pain.

It can also occur due to heat toxins or invasion of wind evils, causing a conflict between blood Qi and evil Qi, resulting in stagnation and formation of swelling. If the kidney Qi is deficient, or if one sits on stones and does not move, cool air can condense it; or if one is close to the ground for a long time, wind and dampness can cause harm, swelling becomes less likely. Occasionally, if there is crying and anger that becomes blocked in the lower parts, and if fluid circulation is obstructed, it can also lead to this condition. The treatment employs the Peach Kernel Pill. Danxi stated that if there is a significant hernia, it can fall down and not retract, using the stems and leaves of perilla as a powder, mixed with water and wrapped in lotus leaves. One person transmitted this method, using wild white perilla as powder, applying it wet, or adjusting it with fragrant oil when dry; even when the skin ruptures and the protrusion descends, there are remarkable effects.

The Inner Canon states: “For those with distended skin or hernias, the yin is excessive, and the pulse is blocked.” Thus, it indicates the excess of yin Qi leading to this condition. As for retraction, it is caused by tense tendons. When tendons encounter cold, they retract; when they encounter heat, they relax.
