<p><strong>Direct Instructions for Pediatric Abdominal Pain</strong> 【Song Dynasty, Qian Yi】</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>If a child experiences abdominal pain, has a thin body, pale complexion, lacks luster in the eyes, has cold breath in the mouth, has no desire to eat, or is vomiting with foul breath, this indicates a deficiency in the spleen and is harmed by cold water. Use Yihuang San (Enhanced Yellow Powder) or Tiaozhong Wan (Regulating the Middle Pill) to treat it. If the breath is warm in the mouth, complexion is yellow and white, lacks eye luster, or if there is excessive sleep with poor appetite or foul-smelling stools, this is due to accumulated pain, and use Xiaojiyuan (Pill for Digestion) to treat it. If severe, administer white cakes (Bai Bingzi) followed by Baizhu San (Atractylodes Powder) to tonify the stomach energy.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Abdominal pain with no appetite, cold breath, diarrhea with foul breath, etc., belong to the category of physical illness caused by deficiency and cold. Use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction) with roasted ginger for warming. Symptoms such as excessive sleep, warm breath with poor appetite, yellow and white complexion, etc., indicate an excess of pathogenic qi yet deficiency of original qi. Use Liu Jun Zi Tang with Shen Qu (Malt) and Shan Zha (Hawthorn) for digestive assistance.</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Worm Pain</strong></p>
<p>If one coughs up phlegm or clear water, has a pale face, and experiences intermittent pain in the heart and abdomen, this is worm pain. It resembles epilepsy, but the eyes do not stray and there are no hand convulsions. Treat it with the Anzhong Powder. </p>
<p>[Note: Worms are caused by damp heat or transformed from wood energy. They may arise from weakness of the organs or from a cold or hot stomach, being inherent to the body. Symptoms include intermittent pain, coughing up saliva, emaciation, and a lack of proper complexion. The main treatment should focus on regulating and tonifying the spleen and stomach. If worms are affecting the upper part of the body, there will be white spots on the upper lip; if affecting the lower part, there will be white spots on the lower lip. Worms in the abdomen, after the new moon, have their heads oriented upwards; after the full moon, their heads point downwards. If using medicine, first cook meat close to children to let them smell its fragrance, causing the worm heads to turn upward, making the medicine more effective. Danxi remarked that in winter, expelling worms often indicates a deficiency of stomach energy and coldness. Using Qian’s Baizhu Powder, with two grains of clove added for tonification, can be beneficial. Clearly, children’s worms are primarily caused by dietary harm to the spleen. For those suffering from sores and itch-related worms or lice, these are due to liver wood energy.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Intestinal Pain</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences intestinal pain and bends at the waist, crying without a sound, this is known as &quot;intestinal twist pain,&quot; resembling internal bait but without direct observation. The remedy is Gold Ingot Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal pain often occurs due to the conflict of external and internal pathogens, striking against the visceral energies. If the pain is accompanied by heat, the face will be red or hot, with agitated limbs and warmth in the palms and soles. If accompanied by cold, the complexion may be pale or blue, with cold hands and feet. If it becomes severe with cold, the face darkens and the lips and mouth turn black, with bluish nails. For cases of heat, a cooling drink with bitter orange peel or bitter herb is advised; for cold, Seven Qi Decoction with spicy cinnamon is recommended, along with Suhexiang Pill. If there is a conflict of external and internal factors causing imbalance of hot and cold, a decoction of Platycodon and bitter orange was combined with green peel, dried orange peel, wood incense, and angelica is excellent. For symptoms resembling internal bait, use Hookvine Powder; otherwise, Peony and Licorice Decoction is essential. For real pain with heat, Da Chaihu Decoction is the main remedy. For severe heart and abdominal pain with excess heat, use Da Chengqi Decoction. For abdominal pain, Gui Zhi Decoction with peony; for severe pain, Gui Zhi Decoction with rhubarb.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<h3>Intestinal Gas Pain</h3>
<p>Intestinal gas pain causes one to bend over and cry out, and there is sweat on the forehead. This indicates that the small intestine has been struck by cold air. The mouth is closed, the feet are cold, and the upper lip is dry. This can occur after childbirth when the body is weak, catching a chill, or from unripe food, leading to these symptoms. You should take Diaoteng extract, Weixiang powder, Suhexiang pills, or Danggui powder. Nursing mothers can take Wuchen decoction or Shenxiang Jiangqi decoction for relief.</p>
<h3>Roundworm Pain</h3>
<p>According to the Nest Clan, roundworms are one of the nine types of parasites, typically one foot long, though some can be five or six inches. They may move due to weakness in the organs or consumption of sweet, fatty foods. Their movement causes abdominal pain that fluctuates with swelling and may also attack the heart, causing pain; the person has a preference for salivating and clear water. If they injure the heart, it can be fatal. When diagnosing the pulse, if there’s abdominal pain, the pulse should be weak and taut; if the pulse is strong, it indicates roundworms. This pain often arises from eating too early, liking sweetness over bitterness, and the person may cry out loudly in pain. Observing dark spots on the upper lip, nostrils, and mouth indicates this issue. For treatment, you should take Shijunzi pills, betel nut powder, or Huachong pills to eliminate the problem. According to Zhongjing, if there is roundworm constriction, the person should vomit the roundworm; if suffering from vexation, this is due to organ coldness, and Wumei pills are the main remedy. If roundworms penetrate the heart, using coix root decoction will provide relief.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Xue Kai]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain due to Intestinal Qi Disturbance</strong></p>
<p>For children with abdominal pain due to intestinal qi, they will curl their bodies and cry, sweat appearing on their foreheads. This is all caused by the wind pathogen attacking the liver channel. The liver and kidneys are situated lower, hence the curling of the body in response to pain. The crying without tears is due to the wind drying up the fluids. Sweat on the forehead occurs because the wind and wood aggravate heart fire. If the mouth is closed and the feet are cold, it indicates insufficient spleen qi. If there is greenish diarrhea, this is due to liver wood overpowering the spleen. These symptoms often arise from exposure to cold wind during bathing after birth, and it is advisable to take remedies such as Diao Teng Gao. </p>
<p>If the wet nurse or the child has been affected by cold pathogens, use Chen Xiang Decoction or similar remedies. If the child has sweat on the forehead, a closed mouth, and cold feet, this is a sign of deficiency and cold, and remedies such as Dang Gui San or Chen Xiang Jiang Qi Decoction are recommended. If the face is red, the lips are scorched, urine is not passing, and there is abdominal bloating and pain, this indicates heat in the small intestine; administer Ren Shen Decoction followed by San Huang Pills. If the pain does not subside, prepare a decoction of scallions and massage the abdomen. Heat scallions to apply warmth to the navel and abdomen, and over time, the pain will alleviate with urination. Alternatively, a small amount of frankincense, myrrh, and cardamom can be boiled and administered by spoon. </p>
<p>If the condition is due to food stagnation from the wet nurse&#39;s diet, use Bao He Pills. If there is Qi stagnation from holding the baby, add flavored Gui Pi Decoction. If there is liver fire from anger, add flavored Xiao Yao San. It is beneficial for both the mother and child to take the remedies together.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria and Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If a child has abdominal pain, cold air in the mouth, and a lack of appetite, this indicates a deficiency of the spleen and coldness; use the &quot;Tiaozhong Pill&quot; to treat it. If there is warmth in the mouth, sour and foul-smelling stool, and cramping pain, it indicates stagnation; use the &quot;Xiaji Pill&quot; to address it. If the face is red and hot, or if the hands and feet are also hot, this indicates excess heat; use &quot;Xie Huang San&quot; to purge it. If the face is pale and slightly warm, or if the hands and feet are warm as well, it indicates deficiency heat; use &quot;Yigong San&quot; to tonify it. If there is thirst and drinking soup, it indicates deficiency heat in the stomach; use &quot;Bai Zhu San.&quot; If there is pain radiating to both sides of the abdomen, it indicates the liver overpowering the spleen; use &quot;Si Junzi Decoction&quot; with additional Chai Hu and Shao Yao. If there is heavy, sinking abdominal pain, this indicates a sinking of the spleen qi; use &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang&quot; with Sheng Ma. If the hands and feet are cold, or if there is belching or diarrhea, this indicates cold water attacking the spleen; use &quot;Liu Junzi,&quot; with Pao Jiang and Rou Gui; if ineffective, urgently add Fu Zi. If pain occurs after taking medicines to relieve stagnation, and pressing does not cause pain, it indicates further harm to the spleen qi; use &quot;Wu Wei Yi Gong San.&quot; Pain in the middle slice corresponds to the spleen, pain in the lower abdomen corresponds to the kidneys; pressing on the area causes pain indicates stagnation, while not causing pain indicates internal deficiency. For stagnation, eliminate it; for deficiency, tonify it.</p>
<p>Liu&#39;s symptoms of bent waist and crying without tears indicate internal entrapment causing pain; a pale face with lack of appetite indicates cold pain in the stomach; a red face, dry lips, and yellow stool indicate heat pain; a yellow-white face with sour and foul-smelling stool indicates stagnant pain; a bland mouth with spontaneous saliva indicates pain due to worms.</p>
<p>Zeng also describes cold organ pain, locking stomach pain, symptoms of mass pain, scanty pain, accumulation pain, kidney hanging pain, localized pain, and cold hernia pain, each with its own treatment methods, listed subsequently.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Cold Pain</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Mao sings: A face pale and white is still acceptable, but black as blue claws is troubling. This is caused by cold pain in the abdomen and heart, which must be countered with warming medicine. If the stomach is weak and cold, the face becomes pale, leading to abdominal pain and loss of appetite; one should tonify the spleen and soil, using Yihuangsan as the main remedy. If there is no diarrhea, use Dazhongwan as the primary treatment. Yihuangsan treats diarrhea accompanied by pain, while Dazhongwan treats pain without diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Pain</strong></p>
<p>Heat pain also causes incessant cries, with fever at night, a red face, dry lips, and urine that is red and yellow; treat with Sanhuangwan and Ginseng Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulation Pain</strong></p>
<p>Accumulation pain manifests as a dull ache in the abdomen, a yellow face with lack of appetite; children with severe cases may vomit sour fluid. First treat the accumulation, then regulate the spleen and stomach, and the pain will cease on its own, also distinguishing between deficiency and excess for resolution. Detailed treatment methods can be found in the later sections on accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Worm Pain</strong></p>
<p>Worm pain presents as a pale face, heart and abdominal pain, with foam and clear fluid coming from the mouth, and pain occuring occasionally. Tian Shi states: Worm pain leads to cries, with discomfort when lying down or sitting; pressing the heart and abdomen often elicits loud cries, with a face lacking proper color, appearing either green or yellow, pale lips, and unresponsive eyes, and drooling from the mouth, this is called worm pain. Accumulation pain, food-related pain, and deficiency pain have similarities. Worm pain specifically involves a bland mouth with foam arising automatically, treated according to the symptoms with appropriate medicine. Worms resemble epilepsy; children are inherently timid, thus when the stomach is weak and cold, worms stir causing heart pain, treated with Anchongsan as the main remedy.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The Zeng family states: When tapeworms cause pain, the patient may vomit clear saliva or even expel the worm, experiencing unbearable pain. This condition arises from consuming rich, fatty, and overly delicious foods too early, leading to cold in the stomach and worm activity. When the worm is expelled, it may be alive or dead. For young children, this pain can be severe and may even lead to dangerous complications. First, administer the Lijung Decoction with black plum water to warm the stomach; next, use Aloe pills, Passiflora pills, or a remedy for expelling worms. For older children who exhibit a pale face with yellow tones, have a diet heavy in meat, appear emaciated, and experience intermittent abdominal pain, it indicates that blood and tapeworms are mixed inside, for which the Ersheng pills should be given. </p>
<p>Additionally, if the stomach experiences extreme cold or heat, it can also cause worm activity, resulting in either slight pain or no pain at all, suddenly leading to expulsion. The principle should be to stabilize the worms. Treating the worms themselves may harm the stomach&#39;s qi, which is certainly not advisable. If the movement is due to cold, use the Lijung Decoction with black plum water. If due to heat, use (Kouf) Mixture of Wuling Powder, also adding black plum water for decoction.</p>
<p>Abdominal Pain:</p>
<p>When an infant is one month old, suddenly refuses to swallow milk, with the abdomen hard as stone and red like a vermillion, crying with a clenched mouth, face turning pale and lips black, and hands and feet cold, it is initially caused by an improperly tied umbilical cord, allowing wind and cold to invade. This condition is critical; administer White Peony Decoction, Black Plum Powder, and a Golden Needle remedy. If prolonged, recovery becomes difficult, and further reference to navel wind symptoms should be consulted.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Intestinal Pain from Bloating</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences abdominal pain, bending at the waist, crying without tears, with a pale blue face, black lips, and cold limbs, it is due to bloating in the intestines. In such cases, urgently boil green onion soup, wash the abdomen with it, and massage. Apply green onion to the navel and abdomen for a long time, and urine will flow from the pain, immediately relieving it. Next, use a small amount of frankincense and myrrh, finely ground, and a piece of wood fragrance, ground in a mortar with one part water, bringing it to a boil several times. Mix this with the powdered frankincense and myrrh; just one dose is effective.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Mass Pain</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal mass pain arises from prolonged accumulation, caused by deficiency in both the nourishing and protective systems, externally influenced by wind and cold, and internally by excessive consumption of milk and food, leading to stagnation. This, in turn, causes evils in the yin, resulting in symptoms that are quiet and stagnant, while evils in the yang manifest as masses that move and cannot be stilled. If left untreated for too long, it may lead to spleen damage and accumulation; there may be a lump like a stone between the ribs that hurts when pressed, but feels lighter when not pressed; or the face becomes pale and emaciated, with a hard and bloated abdomen, and blue veins appearing, being cool during the day and hot at night, with constant dampness, a reduced appetite for food, and a liking for dirt; or loose stools with accompanying pain, feeling as cold as ice. The treatment should focus on regulating the spleen and nourishing the stomach, using formulas like Sheng Pi San and Shen Ling Bai Zhu San; for accumulation and spleen damage, use Huo Pi Wan, San Ling San, and Mu Xiang E Zhu Wan; for loose stools, use Mo Shi Zi Wan and Chen Xiang Bing Lang Wan. However, this illness caused by accumulation and stagnation cannot be cured with just a few doses; it requires a systematic regulation approach, and over time, it will naturally subside.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Numbness and Pain</strong></p>
<p>Initially, there is a small, elongated hard mass in the abdomen, as hard as an arm, moving around the waist, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right. After a long time, the pain becomes severe and can be felt beneath the skin. There is no need to avoid dairy or grains. The condition usually arises from a prior illness; if the exterior has not yet resolved, and one hastily purges too much, it leads to stagnation of cold and qi deficiency, resulting in this condition. The appropriate treatment should tonify qi and regulate deficiency, using ginseng, poria, and atractylodes powder, as well as agarwood and betel nut pills, and muxiang and calamus pills for treatment. Alternatively, one can intermittently use white peony decoction with added ginseng and poria, boiled with ginger to take as a medicine. It should be noted that the symptoms of masses or nodules have similar characteristics, and the treatment methods are not significantly different; thus, there is no need to name each condition distinctly.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Pain</strong></p>
<p>For children with heart pain, one should refer to the treatments used for adults. If heart pain is accompanied by vomiting water, it is likely due to parasites.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Heart pain without vomiting water indicates a cold heart pain. </p>
<p>In &quot;Shenghui,&quot; when treating children&#39;s heart pain, if the child is seen to rub their abdomen with their hands and then cries, it indicates unbearable heart pain, which should be treated with a prescription of Shao Yao San (Peony Powder). Mr. Mao treats children&#39;s heart pain using Jinling San (Golden Bell Powder).</p>
<p><strong>External Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In the Zhuang family&#39;s tradition for children who cannot yet speak, if they cry without being able to articulate their pain, one should place a hand on their stomach. If there is a hard mass, it indicates abdominal pain. For treatment, grind fresh ginger to extract its juice, warm it, mix it with flour to form a paste, apply it on paper, and stick it to the navel.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>The issue of abdominal pain in children is indeed urgent. Infants aged two to three months or within a week often suffer from abdominal pain. If they cry incessantly without cause, or cry excessively at night, it is mostly due to abdominal pain. There are generally two causes: cold and heat. In the case of cold, the child’s face appears pale and lips turn blue; they may have diarrhea characterized by greenish or whitish stools, and their crying decreases when their abdomen is wrapped warmly, indicative of cold. On the other hand, if caused by heat, the face is red, the lips are bright; when warmed, their crying worsens, indicating heat. Beyond one week, if they are capable of eating, they may have abdominal pain due to injury from heat, accompanied by diarrhea or not, thirst and foul breath, with a yellowish face and body heat, indicating accumulation pain. If this persists without improvement, it is likely to develop into sores. Outside of these three causes, as mentioned in the &quot;Neijing&quot; (Inner Canon), it states that sudden pain in the five organs, due to the invasion of cold pathogens, must be carefully observed.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If &quot;Lèi Cuì&quot; refers to children, it broadly discusses cold and heat without addressing the heat and accumulation specifically, which is like seeing a leopard through a tube—one cannot perceive its complete spots. Abdominal pain arises from the conflict between evil and rightful Qi. For those with heat pain, it is indicated by a red face or strong heat, with restlessness in the limbs and hot palms; for those with cold, the complexion appears bluish-white. In severe cases, this changes the symptoms, leading to black lips and bluish nails. For heat symptoms, prescriptions include Huang Qin and Shao Yao Decoction, or Si Shun Qing Liang Drink; for cold symptoms, use Li Zhong Decoction or Zhi Mi Qi Qi Decoction with Gui and Su He Wan. Qian suggests that for children&#39;s accumulation pain, with a yellow face, white eyes lacking luster, excessive sleep, fear of food, and foul-smelling stool, one should use Xiao Ji Wan; in severe cases, 白饼子 should be administered, followed by harmonizing the stomach. Worm-related pain often occurs in the heart and abdomen, with clear water being vomited; An Chong San is used for this.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s Health Treatises - Author Unknown (Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>On Abdominal Pain:</p>
<p>Children&#39;s abdominal pain is due to the weakness of the organs and the invasion of cold Qi, where evil Qi collides with the Qi of the organs, impacting from above and below. This may cause heart pain above and abdominal pain below, or both at once. There is another symptom where the abdomen cramps, leading to crying without tears, a curved back, dry upper lip, and sweating on the forehead. This is known as the pain of &quot;internal angling,&quot; also caused by cold Qi entering the organs.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>
<p><strong>Taqi Pill</strong>: Treats abdominal distension due to deficiency.<br>One ounce of pepper, five qian of scorpion tails, detoxified.<br>Grind into powder, mix with millet paste into balls the size of sorghum grains; take 10 to 20 pills with aged rice drink. Xue Ji said: According to the previous symptoms, this pertains to the deficiency of the spleen and lungs, with water and qi causing ascites and shortness of breath, and one must also tonify the spleen to generate the lung&#39;s metal, allowing the qi to circulate on its own. However, the properties of the previous herbs are spicy and hot; while they can dispel cold pathogens, one must be careful not to harm the genuine qi by excessive dosage.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao Ji Pill</strong>: Treats food accumulation with sour-smelling, hot stools.<br>Nine cloves, twelve pieces of buckthorn, two seeds of croton (skin and heart removed), three pieces of black plum flesh.<br>Grind into powder, mix with flour into balls the size of millet grains; take 5 to 7 pills with warm water. Xue Ji said: If food accumulation has been relieved but the heat does not recede, or if one feels nauseous and eats little, one should use Wuwei Yigong Powder to tonify the stomach qi, or use Si Junzi Decoction with peppermint and Pinellia to soothe the middle qi. If accompanied by diarrhea, use Liu Junzi Decoction; if unresponsive, add Shengma and Chaihu to further support the spleen qi. If diarrhea persists for long, consider using Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to elevate and replenish yang qi. If there is deficiency and cold, add roasted ginger and cardamom; if still unresponsive, supplement with Sishen Pill to nourish the spleen and kidneys.

</li>
</ul>
<p>For children suffering from pain in the heart and abdomen due to roundworms: grind crabgrass into a powder and take it with fat meat oil; for a child of five, give two pennies worth; the worms will immediately stop.</p>
<p>In a medical case recorded by Qian Yi in &quot;Essentials for Treating Children&quot;: A five-year-old girl from the Xin family was suffering from worm pain, and various doctors treated her with croton seed, dried lacquer, and minerals without effect. After five days, she cried a lot, was restless in sleeping, pressed on her abdomen, sometimes screamed loudly, her face lacked color, appearing either blue, yellow, white, or black, her eyes lacked brightness and were slow, and her lips were pale with froth. By the sixth day, her chest was high as she lay down and was restless, so they summoned Qian. Qian examined her closely, and after using yam root powder three times, he noticed the blue color did not disappear, and was greatly alarmed, saying: &quot;This condition is severely troubled; if you further laxate her, it would become oppositional.&quot; The next day, Xin reported to Qian: &quot;Last night at the third watch, she indeed had diarrhea.&quot; Qian looked in the diarrhea bowl and saw what looked like medicinal pills; he stirred it with a stick and noted there were round medicines. Qian stated: &quot;This child has a thick body and should have strong Qi, yet the current symptoms are the opposite of that; they are weak. If the spleen is weak and the stomach is cold, the worms would move. Now, with the blue eyes, the liver is overacting on the spleen, and further laxation would lead to even more Qi deficiency.&quot; The round medicine passing with the stool indicated the spleen and stomach were exhausted. Coupled with the existing illness not aligning with the symptoms, it was clear this was a fatal condition. After five more days, she became comatose, and after seven days, she died.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>A young child suffered from heat due to improper diet, exhibiting vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and desired to take Yihuang Powder. I said: &quot;There is clove and ginger in it, which are not suitable; the previous symptoms indicated that the spleen and stomach were injured without signs of cold.&quot; Not believing me, they continued with the previous medicine, resulting in increased pain, constipation, and ulceration of the mouth and tongue, leading to death.</p>
<p>Luo Qianfu recounted: &quot;A young child in May suffered abdominal pain from eating cold powder. They bought Shenqiong Pill from a pharmacy, which caused the pain around the navel to become cooler and more painful, intermittently for seven to eight years without relief. Reflecting on the ancients’ saying: &#39;Treat cold with heat,&#39; though a good doctor cannot abandon principles for alternative methods. The cause of injury was cold; the attacking medicine was also cold. Severe cold injures the stomach, leading to discernible cold pain. Generally, people’s spleens and stomachs prefer warmth and dislike cold, especially since children have weak blood and energy and cannot tolerate cold. Thus, the yang energy becomes hidden, resulting in lingering cold poison that cannot be dispelled over time. To treat illness, one must address the root; it is necessary to use harmonizing and qi-nourishing medicine to rectify earlier mistakes. After taking this for a month, the child recovered.&quot;<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Alas! When Kongzi was given medicine by Kangzi, he bowed and accepted it, yet out of caution, he did not dare to taste it. This shows the importance of preserving life. How unfortunate that ordinary people remain silent and merely take the pulse, believing they can understand the illness. The pulse reflects the blood and energy of a person, coursing through the meridians; when heat prevails, the pulse quickens, and when cold prevails, the pulse slows. If the pulse is strong, the body is robust; if weak, the body is frail. As for the nature of the injury, how can one discern its essence? A doctor must carefully examine the source of the illness, and the patient&#39;s family must also clearly communicate the source of the ailment. Furthermore, this person&#39;s father did not inform the doctor of the illness&#39;s origin but sought medicine in the marketplace. The pharmacist did not investigate the source of the illness either and simply dispensed the medication, resulting in a seven or eight-year affliction, completely overlooking this principle. Master Sun said: &quot;Before diagnosing, ask first; this is most reliable.&quot; Dongpo said: &quot;One should seek to cure the illness rather than burden the doctor.&quot; The words of these two sages have greatly benefited the world!<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>The Xue family&#39;s &quot;Essentials of Infant Care&quot; states: A young child has cold hands and feet, experiences abdominal pain, and has difficulty digesting food. I believe this indicates a deficiency of stomach qi and coldness. First, administer two doses of Yihuang Powder to stop the pain, and then use Liu Junzi Decoction for several doses to cure it.</p>
<p>Another young child has a flushed face at the hour of the rooster and dog, experiences abdominal pain that worsens with pressure, and after taking harsh medicines has five to seven bouts of diarrhea, convulsions, phlegm, thirst, and abdominal pain that does not hurt upon pressing. This is a result of damage to the spleen and stomach leading to a change in symptoms, and I recommend using Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to stabilize them immediately.</p>
<p>In one case, a young child frequently experiences abdominal pain after eating, with a flushed face and dizziness. Using Qing Zhong Jie Yu Decoction resolves the issue. Later, the child shakes their head and grinds their teeth due to excessive phlegm, followed by vomiting sour bile. After all the vomit has been expelled, the next day provide some Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder, and then the following day use Shen Ling Bai Zhu Powder to regulate the spleen and stomach, ensuring no recurrence of the problem. Generally, once the vomiting has ceased, the child stabilizes without the need for further medication, fearing further damage to the vital energy.</p>
<p>In another instance, a five-year-old child has abdominal pain after stopping eating, with fever and a flushed face. When treating with Yang Wei Decoction, zhiqiao, and huanglian, the abdominal distension increased, especially in the afternoon. Despite the abdomen not hurting when pressed, I suspect a deficiency of the spleen and that the medicine is causing harm, therefore administering several doses of Liu Junzi Decoction leads to recovery.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>A young child had a strong craving for meat, which led to abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements. After half a year, the abdomen became swollen, and a mass developed in the right side, shifting occasionally; after another three months, a mass formed in the left side as well, and there was swelling in the chest and abdomen. The child had thirst due to ulcers in the gums, with urine that was either red, thin, or clear, and the stool varied in color and consistency. After another half year, several lumps formed under the chin, and after taking medications to reduce the masses and address stagnation, the child&#39;s vitality became weaker, and the masses increased. I used medicines like the Four Flavor Fat Infant Pill and the Five Flavor Yi Gong Powder, adjusting treatment according to symptoms, and the excessive thirst gradually subsided. After more than a month, the abdominal swelling diminished, and I added remedies like the Nine Flavor Aloe Pill, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had irregular eating habits, which led to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, with one mass in the abdomen and irregular stool. The child experienced thirst and fever, with ulcers in the gums and bad breath, and had been taking medicines to resolve stagnation, but the previous symptoms worsened, and the child became emaciated. I said: the complexion was yellow with a hint of blue, indicating a deficiency in the spleen and a weakness that the liver was taking advantage of. The treatment should focus on tonifying the middle qi and calming the liver, thus revitalizing the spleen qi and reducing the internal heat, which would then alleviate all symptoms. I then used medicines like the Harmony Decoction and the Large Purslane Decoction, and indeed, the child recovered.</p>
<p>In yet another case, a child experienced pain in the heart and abdomen due to intestinal worms. Initially, I prescribed the Purslane Powder to purge the intestines, but the child then began to vomit, eat less, felt thirsty, and preferred to drink soup. The right side of the face appeared pale while the nasal tip was yellow, indicating a deficiency in the spleen and lung qi. I used two doses of Yi Gong Powder with slight improvement and then added a dose of roasted ginger, bringing the child to a state of calm.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>A small child bent over and cried, with a dark blue-black mark on the right cheek, experiencing abdominal pain, as if in the intestines. This was due to deficiency and coldness in the spleen, with the liver&#39;s wood overacting on it. Using the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added musk and polygala, the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another small child, after the wet nurse became very angry, exhibited similar symptoms, with a red face and crying, facing difficulty with urination. The modified Happy Wanderer Powder with added houttuynia and plantain seeds was administered, and both mother and child recovered.</p>
<p>A small child cried with a red face, hands and feet warm, and was cured with a polygala decoction. Later, due to the mother consuming alcohol and rich food, the child began to cry again, with hands and feet becoming hot. The previous medicine was used again, adding fresh rehmannia, leading to recovery. Subsequently, the child exhibited a blue face, cold hands, cried and had diarrhea, with foul-smelling stool. A single dose of stomach-strengthening paste was administered to bring peace.</p>
<p>A small child showed the previous symptoms, bent over and crying, sweating on the forehead, with cold feet, blue lips, and greenish stool. Initially treated with the polygala paste, the child recovered. After relapsing, the same polygala remedy was used, reducing the pain by half. Additionally, onion soup was boiled and used to wash the abdomen, leading to alleviation of abdominal pain.</p>
<p>A small child had blue lips, cold feet, and continuous crying. A single dose of stomach-strengthening paste provided some relief. However, after consuming cold food, the previous symptoms recurred with ongoing diarrhea. Initially treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added musk and dried ginger, followed by two more doses without musk and dried ginger, the diarrhea promptly stopped. A modified Four Gentlemen Decoction with a slight addition of Cimicifuga was administered for four doses, allowing for an increase in food intake.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>A young boy, fourteen years old, suffered from abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, with cold hands and feet, and a weak physique. I attributed this to the deficiency of the fire of life. I treated him with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Eight Flavor Pill, and he gradually improved. </p>
<p>After marriage, due to the exertion of marital activities and intense studying, he caught a cold and sweated excessively. This, combined with dietary overwork, morning coolness, evening heat, and loss of appetite, led to a reliance on the Six Gentlemen and the Totally Restorative Decoction for recovery. </p>
<p>Later, due to careless eating and lifestyle, he developed heat below the navel in the morning, causing his whole body to feel scorched; by afternoon, the cold sensation in his feet rose to his waist, feeling like ice. When he was hot, his pulse was large and surging, but felt non-existent upon pressure, while the pulse was slightly stronger at the two-inch mark; when cold, the six pulses were thin and weak as if they had disappeared. He felt cold in his stomach after consuming food warmed just a little. This indicated a deficiency in the fire of life as well. </p>
<p>I administered the Center-Supplementing and Qi-Increasing Decoction and the Eight Flavor Pill, each over a hundred doses, and he gradually recovered. Then, he experienced a severe bout of vomiting blood. I mistakenly gave him a dose of the Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Pill, worsening his condition, leading to decreased appetite, a pale complexion, cold hands and feet, and occasional fever. </p>
<p>When cold, his pulse was thin and short, indicative of a significant deficiency of Yang energy; when hot, his pulse was large and weak, indicating a surplus of Yin fire due to deficiency. I then used the Totally Restorative Decoction along with the Eight Treasures Decoction and the Six Gentlemen Decoction, but they could only support him without stopping the bleeding. </p>
<p>Again due to overexertion, he bled heavily. His pulse was large and surging, pressing down felt non-existent, and the two-inch pulse was short, signaling a great deficiency in Yang energy. I used one tael of ginseng, five qian of aconite, and complemented these with the Center-Supplementing and Qi-Increasing Decoction, and his various symptoms gradually subsided. I then reduced the aconite by five fen, and after several more doses, all pulse and symptom abnormalities retreated. Eventually, I had him take five qian of ginseng and five fen of roasted ginger with each dose, and after more than a month, he finally recovered.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Direct Instructions for Pediatric Abdominal Pain</strong> 【Song Dynasty, Qian Yi】</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>If a child experiences abdominal pain, has a thin body, pale complexion, lacks luster in the eyes, has cold breath in the mouth, has no desire to eat, or is vomiting with foul breath, this indicates a deficiency in the spleen and is harmed by cold water. Use Yihuang San (Enhanced Yellow Powder) or Tiaozhong Wan (Regulating the Middle Pill) to treat it. If the breath is warm in the mouth, complexion is yellow and white, lacks eye luster, or if there is excessive sleep with poor appetite or foul-smelling stools, this is due to accumulated pain, and use Xiaojiyuan (Pill for Digestion) to treat it. If severe, administer white cakes (Bai Bingzi) followed by Baizhu San (Atractylodes Powder) to tonify the stomach energy.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Abdominal pain with no appetite, cold breath, diarrhea with foul breath, etc., belong to the category of physical illness caused by deficiency and cold. Use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction) with roasted ginger for warming. Symptoms such as excessive sleep, warm breath with poor appetite, yellow and white complexion, etc., indicate an excess of pathogenic qi yet deficiency of original qi. Use Liu Jun Zi Tang with Shen Qu (Malt) and Shan Zha (Hawthorn) for digestive assistance.</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Worm Pain</strong></p>
<p>If one coughs up phlegm or clear water, has a pale face, and experiences intermittent pain in the heart and abdomen, this is worm pain. It resembles epilepsy, but the eyes do not stray and there are no hand convulsions. Treat it with the Anzhong Powder. </p>
<p>[Note: Worms are caused by damp heat or transformed from wood energy. They may arise from weakness of the organs or from a cold or hot stomach, being inherent to the body. Symptoms include intermittent pain, coughing up saliva, emaciation, and a lack of proper complexion. The main treatment should focus on regulating and tonifying the spleen and stomach. If worms are affecting the upper part of the body, there will be white spots on the upper lip; if affecting the lower part, there will be white spots on the lower lip. Worms in the abdomen, after the new moon, have their heads oriented upwards; after the full moon, their heads point downwards. If using medicine, first cook meat close to children to let them smell its fragrance, causing the worm heads to turn upward, making the medicine more effective. Danxi remarked that in winter, expelling worms often indicates a deficiency of stomach energy and coldness. Using Qian’s Baizhu Powder, with two grains of clove added for tonification, can be beneficial. Clearly, children’s worms are primarily caused by dietary harm to the spleen. For those suffering from sores and itch-related worms or lice, these are due to liver wood energy.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Intestinal Pain</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences intestinal pain and bends at the waist, crying without a sound, this is known as &quot;intestinal twist pain,&quot; resembling internal bait but without direct observation. The remedy is Gold Ingot Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal pain often occurs due to the conflict of external and internal pathogens, striking against the visceral energies. If the pain is accompanied by heat, the face will be red or hot, with agitated limbs and warmth in the palms and soles. If accompanied by cold, the complexion may be pale or blue, with cold hands and feet. If it becomes severe with cold, the face darkens and the lips and mouth turn black, with bluish nails. For cases of heat, a cooling drink with bitter orange peel or bitter herb is advised; for cold, Seven Qi Decoction with spicy cinnamon is recommended, along with Suhexiang Pill. If there is a conflict of external and internal factors causing imbalance of hot and cold, a decoction of Platycodon and bitter orange was combined with green peel, dried orange peel, wood incense, and angelica is excellent. For symptoms resembling internal bait, use Hookvine Powder; otherwise, Peony and Licorice Decoction is essential. For real pain with heat, Da Chaihu Decoction is the main remedy. For severe heart and abdominal pain with excess heat, use Da Chengqi Decoction. For abdominal pain, Gui Zhi Decoction with peony; for severe pain, Gui Zhi Decoction with rhubarb.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Intestinal Gas Pain</h3>
<p>Intestinal gas pain causes one to bend over and cry out, and there is sweat on the forehead. This indicates that the small intestine has been struck by cold air. The mouth is closed, the feet are cold, and the upper lip is dry. This can occur after childbirth when the body is weak, catching a chill, or from unripe food, leading to these symptoms. You should take Diaoteng extract, Weixiang powder, Suhexiang pills, or Danggui powder. Nursing mothers can take Wuchen decoction or Shenxiang Jiangqi decoction for relief.</p>

<p>According to the Nest Clan, roundworms are one of the nine types of parasites, typically one foot long, though some can be five or six inches. They may move due to weakness in the organs or consumption of sweet, fatty foods. Their movement causes abdominal pain that fluctuates with swelling and may also attack the heart, causing pain; the person has a preference for salivating and clear water. If they injure the heart, it can be fatal. When diagnosing the pulse, if there’s abdominal pain, the pulse should be weak and taut; if the pulse is strong, it indicates roundworms. This pain often arises from eating too early, liking sweetness over bitterness, and the person may cry out loudly in pain. Observing dark spots on the upper lip, nostrils, and mouth indicates this issue. For treatment, you should take Shijunzi pills, betel nut powder, or Huachong pills to eliminate the problem. According to Zhongjing, if there is roundworm constriction, the person should vomit the roundworm; if suffering from vexation, this is due to organ coldness, and Wumei pills are the main remedy. If roundworms penetrate the heart, using coix root decoction will provide relief.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Abdominal Pain due to Intestinal Qi Disturbance</strong></p>
<p>For children with abdominal pain due to intestinal qi, they will curl their bodies and cry, sweat appearing on their foreheads. This is all caused by the wind pathogen attacking the liver channel. The liver and kidneys are situated lower, hence the curling of the body in response to pain. The crying without tears is due to the wind drying up the fluids. Sweat on the forehead occurs because the wind and wood aggravate heart fire. If the mouth is closed and the feet are cold, it indicates insufficient spleen qi. If there is greenish diarrhea, this is due to liver wood overpowering the spleen. These symptoms often arise from exposure to cold wind during bathing after birth, and it is advisable to take remedies such as Diao Teng Gao. </p>
<p>If the wet nurse or the child has been affected by cold pathogens, use Chen Xiang Decoction or similar remedies. If the child has sweat on the forehead, a closed mouth, and cold feet, this is a sign of deficiency and cold, and remedies such as Dang Gui San or Chen Xiang Jiang Qi Decoction are recommended. If the face is red, the lips are scorched, urine is not passing, and there is abdominal bloating and pain, this indicates heat in the small intestine; administer Ren Shen Decoction followed by San Huang Pills. If the pain does not subside, prepare a decoction of scallions and massage the abdomen. Heat scallions to apply warmth to the navel and abdomen, and over time, the pain will alleviate with urination. Alternatively, a small amount of frankincense, myrrh, and cardamom can be boiled and administered by spoon. </p>
<p>If the condition is due to food stagnation from the wet nurse&#39;s diet, use Bao He Pills. If there is Qi stagnation from holding the baby, add flavored Gui Pi Decoction. If there is liver fire from anger, add flavored Xiao Yao San. It is beneficial for both the mother and child to take the remedies together.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cold Pain</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Mao sings: A face pale and white is still acceptable, but black as blue claws is troubling. This is caused by cold pain in the abdomen and heart, which must be countered with warming medicine. If the stomach is weak and cold, the face becomes pale, leading to abdominal pain and loss of appetite; one should tonify the spleen and soil, using Yihuangsan as the main remedy. If there is no diarrhea, use Dazhongwan as the primary treatment. Yihuangsan treats diarrhea accompanied by pain, while Dazhongwan treats pain without diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Pain</strong></p>
<p>Heat pain also causes incessant cries, with fever at night, a red face, dry lips, and urine that is red and yellow; treat with Sanhuangwan and Ginseng Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulation Pain</strong></p>
<p>Accumulation pain manifests as a dull ache in the abdomen, a yellow face with lack of appetite; children with severe cases may vomit sour fluid. First treat the accumulation, then regulate the spleen and stomach, and the pain will cease on its own, also distinguishing between deficiency and excess for resolution. Detailed treatment methods can be found in the later sections on accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Worm Pain</strong></p>
<p>Worm pain presents as a pale face, heart and abdominal pain, with foam and clear fluid coming from the mouth, and pain occuring occasionally. Tian Shi states: Worm pain leads to cries, with discomfort when lying down or sitting; pressing the heart and abdomen often elicits loud cries, with a face lacking proper color, appearing either green or yellow, pale lips, and unresponsive eyes, and drooling from the mouth, this is called worm pain. Accumulation pain, food-related pain, and deficiency pain have similarities. Worm pain specifically involves a bland mouth with foam arising automatically, treated according to the symptoms with appropriate medicine. Worms resemble epilepsy; children are inherently timid, thus when the stomach is weak and cold, worms stir causing heart pain, treated with Anchongsan as the main remedy.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Zeng family states: When tapeworms cause pain, the patient may vomit clear saliva or even expel the worm, experiencing unbearable pain. This condition arises from consuming rich, fatty, and overly delicious foods too early, leading to cold in the stomach and worm activity. When the worm is expelled, it may be alive or dead. For young children, this pain can be severe and may even lead to dangerous complications. First, administer the Lijung Decoction with black plum water to warm the stomach; next, use Aloe pills, Passiflora pills, or a remedy for expelling worms. For older children who exhibit a pale face with yellow tones, have a diet heavy in meat, appear emaciated, and experience intermittent abdominal pain, it indicates that blood and tapeworms are mixed inside, for which the Ersheng pills should be given. </p>
<p>Additionally, if the stomach experiences extreme cold or heat, it can also cause worm activity, resulting in either slight pain or no pain at all, suddenly leading to expulsion. The principle should be to stabilize the worms. Treating the worms themselves may harm the stomach&#39;s qi, which is certainly not advisable. If the movement is due to cold, use the Lijung Decoction with black plum water. If due to heat, use (Kouf) Mixture of Wuling Powder, also adding black plum water for decoction.</p>
<p>Abdominal Pain:</p>
<p>When an infant is one month old, suddenly refuses to swallow milk, with the abdomen hard as stone and red like a vermillion, crying with a clenched mouth, face turning pale and lips black, and hands and feet cold, it is initially caused by an improperly tied umbilical cord, allowing wind and cold to invade. This condition is critical; administer White Peony Decoction, Black Plum Powder, and a Golden Needle remedy. If prolonged, recovery becomes difficult, and further reference to navel wind symptoms should be consulted.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Intestinal Pain from Bloating</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences abdominal pain, bending at the waist, crying without tears, with a pale blue face, black lips, and cold limbs, it is due to bloating in the intestines. In such cases, urgently boil green onion soup, wash the abdomen with it, and massage. Apply green onion to the navel and abdomen for a long time, and urine will flow from the pain, immediately relieving it. Next, use a small amount of frankincense and myrrh, finely ground, and a piece of wood fragrance, ground in a mortar with one part water, bringing it to a boil several times. Mix this with the powdered frankincense and myrrh; just one dose is effective.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Mass Pain</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal mass pain arises from prolonged accumulation, caused by deficiency in both the nourishing and protective systems, externally influenced by wind and cold, and internally by excessive consumption of milk and food, leading to stagnation. This, in turn, causes evils in the yin, resulting in symptoms that are quiet and stagnant, while evils in the yang manifest as masses that move and cannot be stilled. If left untreated for too long, it may lead to spleen damage and accumulation; there may be a lump like a stone between the ribs that hurts when pressed, but feels lighter when not pressed; or the face becomes pale and emaciated, with a hard and bloated abdomen, and blue veins appearing, being cool during the day and hot at night, with constant dampness, a reduced appetite for food, and a liking for dirt; or loose stools with accompanying pain, feeling as cold as ice. The treatment should focus on regulating the spleen and nourishing the stomach, using formulas like Sheng Pi San and Shen Ling Bai Zhu San; for accumulation and spleen damage, use Huo Pi Wan, San Ling San, and Mu Xiang E Zhu Wan; for loose stools, use Mo Shi Zi Wan and Chen Xiang Bing Lang Wan. However, this illness caused by accumulation and stagnation cannot be cured with just a few doses; it requires a systematic regulation approach, and over time, it will naturally subside.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

The condition usually arises from a prior illness; if the exterior has not yet resolved, and one hastily purges too much, it leads to stagnation of cold and qi deficiency, resulting in this condition. The appropriate treatment should tonify qi and regulate deficiency, using ginseng, poria, and atractylodes powder, as well as agarwood and betel nut pills, and muxiang and calamus pills for treatment.

<p>In &quot;Shenghui,&quot; when treating children&#39;s heart pain, if the child is seen to rub their abdomen with their hands and then cries, it indicates unbearable heart pain, which should be treated with a prescription of Shao Yao San (Peony Powder). Mr. Mao treats children&#39;s heart pain using Jinling San (Golden Bell Powder).</p>
<p><strong>External Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In the Zhuang family&#39;s tradition for children who cannot yet speak, if they cry without being able to articulate their pain, one should place a hand on their stomach. If there is a hard mass, it indicates abdominal pain. For treatment, grind fresh ginger to extract its juice, warm it, mix it with flour to form a paste, apply it on paper, and stick it to the navel.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>The issue of abdominal pain in children is indeed urgent. Infants aged two to three months or within a week often suffer from abdominal pain. If they cry incessantly without cause, or cry excessively at night, it is mostly due to abdominal pain. There are generally two causes: cold and heat. In the case of cold, the child’s face appears pale and lips turn blue; they may have diarrhea characterized by greenish or whitish stools, and their crying decreases when their abdomen is wrapped warmly, indicative of cold. On the other hand, if caused by heat, the face is red, the lips are bright; when warmed, their crying worsens, indicating heat. Beyond one week, if they are capable of eating, they may have abdominal pain due to injury from heat, accompanied by diarrhea or not, thirst and foul breath, with a yellowish face and body heat, indicating accumulation pain. If this persists without improvement, it is likely to develop into sores. Outside of these three causes, as mentioned in the &quot;Neijing&quot; (Inner Canon), it states that sudden pain in the five organs, due to the invasion of cold pathogens, must be carefully observed.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If &quot;Lèi Cuì&quot; refers to children, it broadly discusses cold and heat without addressing the heat and accumulation specifically, which is like seeing a leopard through a tube—one cannot perceive its complete spots. Abdominal pain arises from the conflict between evil and rightful Qi. For those with heat pain, it is indicated by a red face or strong heat, with restlessness in the limbs and hot palms; for those with cold, the complexion appears bluish-white. In severe cases, this changes the symptoms, leading to black lips and bluish nails. For heat symptoms, prescriptions include Huang Qin and Shao Yao Decoction, or Si Shun Qing Liang Drink; for cold symptoms, use Li Zhong Decoction or Zhi Mi Qi Qi Decoction with Gui and Su He Wan. Qian suggests that for children&#39;s accumulation pain, with a yellow face, white eyes lacking luster, excessive sleep, fear of food, and foul-smelling stool, one should use Xiao Ji Wan; in severe cases, 白饼子 should be administered, followed by harmonizing the stomach. Worm-related pain often occurs in the heart and abdomen, with clear water being vomited; An Chong San is used for this.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s Health Treatises - Author Unknown (Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>On Abdominal Pain:</p>
<p>Children&#39;s abdominal pain is due to the weakness of the organs and the invasion of cold Qi, where evil Qi collides with the Qi of the organs, impacting from above and below. This may cause heart pain above and abdominal pain below, or both at once. There is another symptom where the abdomen cramps, leading to crying without tears, a curved back, dry upper lip, and sweating on the forehead. This is known as the pain of &quot;internal angling,&quot; also caused by cold Qi entering the organs.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child has intestinal worms and experiences stomach cold and severe symptoms resembling epilepsy: take dried lacquer and burn it until the smoke is gone, then mix it with white yam root to make a powder, and take one to ten grains as a drink. </p>
<p>For children suffering from pain in the heart and abdomen due to roundworms: grind crabgrass into a powder and take it with fat meat oil; for a child of five, give two pennies worth; the worms will immediately stop.</p>
<p>In a medical case recorded by Qian Yi in &quot;Essentials for Treating Children&quot;: A five-year-old girl from the Xin family was suffering from worm pain, and various doctors treated her with croton seed, dried lacquer, and minerals without effect. After five days, she cried a lot, was restless in sleeping, pressed on her abdomen, sometimes screamed loudly, her face lacked color, appearing either blue, yellow, white, or black, her eyes lacked brightness and were slow, and her lips were pale with froth. By the sixth day, her chest was high as she lay down and was restless, so they summoned Qian. Qian examined her closely, and after using yam root powder three times, he noticed the blue color did not disappear, and was greatly alarmed, saying: &quot;This condition is severely troubled; if you further laxate her, it would become oppositional.&quot; The next day, Xin reported to Qian: &quot;Last night at the third watch, she indeed had diarrhea.&quot; Qian looked in the diarrhea bowl and saw what looked like medicinal pills; he stirred it with a stick and noted there were round medicines. Qian stated: &quot;This child has a thick body and should have strong Qi, yet the current symptoms are the opposite of that; they are weak. If the spleen is weak and the stomach is cold, the worms would move. Now, with the blue eyes, the liver is overacting on the spleen, and further laxation would lead to even more Qi deficiency.&quot; The round medicine passing with the stool indicated the spleen and stomach were exhausted. Coupled with the existing illness not aligning with the symptoms, it was clear this was a fatal condition. After five more days, she became comatose, and after seven days, she died.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from heat due to improper diet, exhibiting vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and desired to take Yihuang Powder. I said: &quot;There is clove and ginger in it, which are not suitable; the previous symptoms indicated that the spleen and stomach were injured without signs of cold.&quot; Not believing me, they continued with the previous medicine, resulting in increased pain, constipation, and ulceration of the mouth and tongue, leading to death.</p>
<p>Luo Qianfu recounted: &quot;A young child in May suffered abdominal pain from eating cold powder. They bought Shenqiong Pill from a pharmacy, which caused the pain around the navel to become cooler and more painful, intermittently for seven to eight years without relief. Reflecting on the ancients’ saying: &#39;Treat cold with heat,&#39; though a good doctor cannot abandon principles for alternative methods. The cause of injury was cold; the attacking medicine was also cold. Severe cold injures the stomach, leading to discernible cold pain. Generally, people’s spleens and stomachs prefer warmth and dislike cold, especially since children have weak blood and energy and cannot tolerate cold. Thus, the yang energy becomes hidden, resulting in lingering cold poison that cannot be dispelled over time. To treat illness, one must address the root; it is necessary to use harmonizing and qi-nourishing medicine to rectify earlier mistakes. After taking this for a month, the child recovered.&quot;<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Alas! When Kongzi was given medicine by Kangzi, he bowed and accepted it, yet out of caution, he did not dare to taste it. This shows the importance of preserving life. How unfortunate that ordinary people remain silent and merely take the pulse, believing they can understand the illness. The pulse reflects the blood and energy of a person, coursing through the meridians; when heat prevails, the pulse quickens, and when cold prevails, the pulse slows. If the pulse is strong, the body is robust; if weak, the body is frail. As for the nature of the injury, how can one discern its essence? A doctor must carefully examine the source of the illness, and the patient&#39;s family must also clearly communicate the source of the ailment. Furthermore, this person&#39;s father did not inform the doctor of the illness&#39;s origin but sought medicine in the marketplace. The pharmacist did not investigate the source of the illness either and simply dispensed the medication, resulting in a seven or eight-year affliction, completely overlooking this principle. Master Sun said: &quot;Before diagnosing, ask first; this is most reliable.&quot; Dongpo said: &quot;One should seek to cure the illness rather than burden the doctor.&quot; The words of these two sages have greatly benefited the world!<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Xue family&#39;s &quot;Essentials of Infant Care&quot; states: A young child has cold hands and feet, experiences abdominal pain, and has difficulty digesting food. I believe this indicates a deficiency of stomach qi and coldness. First, administer two doses of Yihuang Powder to stop the pain, and then use Liu Junzi Decoction for several doses to cure it.</p>
<p>Another young child has a flushed face at the hour of the rooster and dog, experiences abdominal pain that worsens with pressure, and after taking harsh medicines has five to seven bouts of diarrhea, convulsions, phlegm, thirst, and abdominal pain that does not hurt upon pressing. This is a result of damage to the spleen and stomach leading to a change in symptoms, and I recommend using Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to stabilize them immediately.</p>
<p>In one case, a young child frequently experiences abdominal pain after eating, with a flushed face and dizziness. Using Qing Zhong Jie Yu Decoction resolves the issue. Later, the child shakes their head and grinds their teeth due to excessive phlegm, followed by vomiting sour bile. After all the vomit has been expelled, the next day provide some Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder, and then the following day use Shen Ling Bai Zhu Powder to regulate the spleen and stomach, ensuring no recurrence of the problem. Generally, once the vomiting has ceased, the child stabilizes without the need for further medication, fearing further damage to the vital energy.</p>
<p>In another instance, a five-year-old child has abdominal pain after stopping eating, with fever and a flushed face. When treating with Yang Wei Decoction, zhiqiao, and huanglian, the abdominal distension increased, especially in the afternoon. Despite the abdomen not hurting when pressed, I suspect a deficiency of the spleen and that the medicine is causing harm, therefore administering several doses of Liu Junzi Decoction leads to recovery.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child had a strong craving for meat, which led to abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements. After half a year, the abdomen became swollen, and a mass developed in the right side, shifting occasionally; after another three months, a mass formed in the left side as well, and there was swelling in the chest and abdomen. The child had thirst due to ulcers in the gums, with urine that was either red, thin, or clear, and the stool varied in color and consistency. After another half year, several lumps formed under the chin, and after taking medications to reduce the masses and address stagnation, the child&#39;s vitality became weaker, and the masses increased. I used medicines like the Four Flavor Fat Infant Pill and the Five Flavor Yi Gong Powder, adjusting treatment according to symptoms, and the excessive thirst gradually subsided. After more than a month, the abdominal swelling diminished, and I added remedies like the Nine Flavor Aloe Pill, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had irregular eating habits, which led to diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, with one mass in the abdomen and irregular stool. The child experienced thirst and fever, with ulcers in the gums and bad breath, and had been taking medicines to resolve stagnation, but the previous symptoms worsened, and the child became emaciated. I said: the complexion was yellow with a hint of blue, indicating a deficiency in the spleen and a weakness that the liver was taking advantage of. The treatment should focus on tonifying the middle qi and calming the liver, thus revitalizing the spleen qi and reducing the internal heat, which would then alleviate all symptoms. I then used medicines like the Harmony Decoction and the Large Purslane Decoction, and indeed, the child recovered.</p>
<p>In yet another case, a child experienced pain in the heart and abdomen due to intestinal worms. Initially, I prescribed the Purslane Powder to purge the intestines, but the child then began to vomit, eat less, felt thirsty, and preferred to drink soup. The right side of the face appeared pale while the nasal tip was yellow, indicating a deficiency in the spleen and lung qi. I used two doses of Yi Gong Powder with slight improvement and then added a dose of roasted ginger, bringing the child to a state of calm.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young boy, fourteen years old, suffered from abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, with cold hands and feet, and a weak physique. I attributed this to the deficiency of the fire of life. I treated him with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Eight Flavor Pill, and he gradually improved. </p>
<p>After marriage, due to the exertion of marital activities and intense studying, he caught a cold and sweated excessively. This, combined with dietary overwork, morning coolness, evening heat, and loss of appetite, led to a reliance on the Six Gentlemen and the Totally Restorative Decoction for recovery. </p>
<p>Later, due to careless eating and lifestyle, he developed heat below the navel in the morning, causing his whole body to feel scorched; by afternoon, the cold sensation in his feet rose to his waist, feeling like ice. When he was hot, his pulse was large and surging, but felt non-existent upon pressure, while the pulse was slightly stronger at the two-inch mark; when cold, the six pulses were thin and weak as if they had disappeared. He felt cold in his stomach after consuming food warmed just a little. This indicated a deficiency in the fire of life as well. </p>
<p>I administered the Center-Supplementing and Qi-Increasing Decoction and the Eight Flavor Pill, each over a hundred doses, and he gradually recovered. Then, he experienced a severe bout of vomiting blood. I mistakenly gave him a dose of the Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Pill, worsening his condition, leading to decreased appetite, a pale complexion, cold hands and feet, and occasional fever. </p>
<p>When cold, his pulse was thin and short, indicative of a significant deficiency of Yang energy; when hot, his pulse was large and weak, indicating a surplus of Yin fire due to deficiency. I then used the Totally Restorative Decoction along with the Eight Treasures Decoction and the Six Gentlemen Decoction, but they could only support him without stopping the bleeding. </p>
<p>Again due to overexertion, he bled heavily. His pulse was large and surging, pressing down felt non-existent, and the two-inch pulse was short, signaling a great deficiency in Yang energy. I used one tael of ginseng, five qian of aconite, and complemented these with the Center-Supplementing and Qi-Increasing Decoction, and his various symptoms gradually subsided. I then reduced the aconite by five fen, and after several more doses, all pulse and symptom abnormalities retreated. Eventually, I had him take five qian of ginseng and five fen of roasted ginger with each dose, and after more than a month, he finally recovered.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>
