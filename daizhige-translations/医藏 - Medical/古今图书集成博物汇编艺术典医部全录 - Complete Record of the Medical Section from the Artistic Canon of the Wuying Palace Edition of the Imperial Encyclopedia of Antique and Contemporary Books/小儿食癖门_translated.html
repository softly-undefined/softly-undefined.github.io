      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Comprehensive Illustrated Collection of Books from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 441</strong><br><strong>Children&#39;s Eating Disorders</strong><br><strong>Direct Methods for Treating Children</strong> 【Song Dynasty, Qian Yi】</p>
<p><strong>Eating Disorders</strong></p>
<p>If there are disorders in the abdomen resulting in refusal to eat but only drinking milk, gradually use white cakes to alleviate it. This condition in children arises from undigested milk and food stagnating in the abdomen, becoming alternatingly cold and hot. Excessive drinking of water may wash away the essential fluids in the intestines and stomach, leading to weakness of the spleen and stomach, which cannot transform and transport food and fluids, resulting in emaciation of the limbs and a gradually enlarging abdomen, ultimately leading to malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is noted that this may be due to excessive intake of milk and food causing harm to the spleen and stomach, or inappropriate lifestyle factors from emotional disturbances. It is essential to first nourish the vital energy as the primary method, supplemented with dispersing agents. If the disorder is not gradually treated, relapses are likely. Common treatments for food accumulation when heat persists include methods for vomiting with reduced appetite, using a mixture of various flavors. For side bloating and reduced appetite, with irritability and diarrhea, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additional ingredients like angelica and bupleurum. For reduced appetite, fatigue, and yellow diarrhea, use the Tonic for Strengthening the Center and Benefiting Qi; for cold hands and feet, add roasted ginger and cardamom; if there are no improvements, use the Four Spirits Pill. If there is emaciation with tidal fever and dry mouth, accompanied by irregular bowel movements, use the Fat Child Pill. If concurrent issues include swollen neck glands and decayed teeth, refer to the preceding guidelines for malnutrition.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>The Teachings of Confucianism on Filial Piety</h3>
<h4>Young Child with Fever</h4>
<p>A young child with a thin body and fever, yellowish face, and a large abdomen may experience vomiting and diarrhea. There are blue veins on the abdomen, and the sides are hard as if in the shape of a bowl. This condition is known as &quot;breast carbuncle&quot; or commonly referred to as &quot;milk blemish.&quot; The breast carbuncle arises from overly thick cotton or silk, excessive consumption of milk, and if there is too much heat, illness develops in the muscles; if too full, it inevitably harms the gastrointestinal system. </p>
<p>Symptoms appearing on the skin include red eyes, reddish lumps, skin conditions, sores in the mouth, and dental problems. Additionally, there can be alternating chills and fever. This is due to the milk nurse holding the child too tightly, causing internal heat to accumulate. The pulse in both hands feels floating and rapid.</p>
<p>When the gastrointestinal tract is harmed, symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, distress, distended abdomen, thin body, yellowish complexion, a large belly with visible green veins, a preference for eating dirt, a habit of rubbing the nose and hair into clumps, and undigested milk, all resulting from overeating.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If not healed for a long time, it will turn into a breast abscess. The pulse is deep and tight in both hands, which is the distinction. All the aforementioned symptoms are due to the excessive indulgence of nursing mothers. For the ailment of accumulation, one can use a formula made from cloves; take it several times, along with medications like beef bile for clearing the phlegm, sweet dew powder, and beneficial yellow powder, ground together. If it does not improve, there is a method of massaging. The incantation is: &quot;Sun essence and moonlight, assist my technique; command, sever, reduce, and dispel the poison!&quot; </p>
<p>For those using this method, each time they recite it, they should take a breath of energy from the sun and blow into their palms to massage. If the child&#39;s ailment is on the left side, the user should massage with the left hand; if on the right, with the right hand. They should also blow on the breast lump for the mother to massage. Boys should be treated on odd days, and girls on even days. It is a grave taboo for a filial child to witness this during wind, rain, or dreary days. The method should ideally be performed before noon on clear and sunny days.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulation of Food</strong></p>
<p>Infantile accumulation of food, phlegm, and heat harming nursing indicates primarily problems with the liver and spleen. The liver is merely excessive, while the spleen is insufficient.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Abdominal Mass</strong></p>
<p>An abdominal mass refers to a blood membrane encapsulating water, located near the sides, causing intermittent pain. This mass can trigger tidal waves of discomfort and produce intermittent cold and heat symptoms, which is why those with malaria often accumulate yellow fluid over time, leading to a recurrence of the mass in the middle abdomen. Such individuals suffer from continuous cold and heat symptoms. If children have balanced organs and their health is regulated, bodily fluids will circulate naturally, and even if they drink a lot of water, they will not feel ill. However, when nursing is not well regulated, and the three burners are obstructed, fluid will stagnate. If cold air interacts with it, a mass will form. For mild cases, a wooden herb pill for accumulation should be used; for severe cases, a pill to dissolve the mass is necessary. Zhong Yang stated: when there is an abdominal mass, one should avoid food and only drink milk gradually, and begin taking white dumplings to flush it out. If not treated early, inability to eat can lead to a weak spleen and stomach, leading to weakness in the limbs, and the emergence of various ailments, resulting in emaciation and wasting.</p>
<p><strong>Chest Oppression and Distension</strong></p>
<p>Oppression indicates blockage. Distension signifies fullness. When heat accumulates between the chest and diaphragm, and fluid gathers in the abdomen and sides, the flow of vital energy becomes obstructed, and the organs can’t function properly. This leads to a distended fullness and subsequently causes oppression, which is a clear sign of actual heat. At times, this can result in intense heat. Sheng Hui&#39;s Gan Sui powder is the remedy for this. This medicine treats the oppression in children, and even when taking decoctions, the stagnation may not relieve, leaving a firm and bloated feeling in the chest that causes crying when pressed. Internal hidden heat accumulates, leading to this ailment. It’s essential to promote bowel movements, break the mass, and disperse the energy. Subsequently, regular consumption of pills for digestion should be encouraged.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>Accumulated Pain</h3>
<p>Zhongyang said: Accumulated pain is characterized by warm breath in the mouth, pale yellow complexion, lack of brightness in the eyes, possibly excessive dryness in the white of the eyes, excessive sleepiness with aversion to food, or smelly, sour stools. In such cases, the accumulation should be ground away and the pain will subside. It is advisable to use &quot;Xiao Ji Wan&quot; (a herbal pill for resolving accumulation); in severe cases, &quot;Bai Bing Zi&quot; (white cakes) should be administered. If the stomach qi is not harmonious afterward, &quot;Bai Zhu San&quot; (Atractylodes powder), &quot;Xiao Chen Xiang Wan&quot; (small cardamom pill), and &quot;Gan Ying Wan&quot; (pills for harmonious response) can be used. In cases of food accumulation leading to abdominal pain with heat signs, &quot;Shao Yao Gan Cao Tang&quot; (Peony and Licorice Decoction) should be taken, adding &quot;Ban Xia&quot; (Pinellia), &quot;Sheng Jiang&quot; (fresh ginger), or even &quot;Zhi Shi&quot; (bitter orange) for effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Accumulated Stagnation</h3>
<p>For infants with accumulation and stagnation, characterized by a yellow and swollen face, heat and swelling in the abdomen, increased sleepiness, excessive crying, refusal to eat, or constipation with oily urine, or loose stools being white and foul-smelling, this is all due to stagnation. However, distinguish clearly between milk accumulation and food accumulation. If there is vomiting or diarrhea of milk with a sour smell, this is due to the infant’s previous cries and feeding, resulting in a stagnation that fails to transform; this is termed milk accumulation. A hard belly with heat, thirst, diarrhea, or vomiting results from indulgent eating habits, excessive meals, and sleeping immediately afterward; this is known as food accumulation. Abdominal pain with crying, and diarrhea that is like gravel indicates a disturbance of qi leading to disharmony of the protective and nourishing aspects, which develops over time; this is classified as qi accumulation. The remedy should include &quot;Mu Xiang Wan&quot; (wood aromatic pills) or &quot;Ping Lang Wan&quot; (betel nut pills). For constipation, &quot;Shen Qiong Wan&quot; is effective. The same applies to conditions with cold-induced accumulation; &quot;Wu Zhen Wan&quot; (Five Treasures Pills) may also be utilized.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Food Accumulation and Cold</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi said: The inability to digest food is due to the coldness of the spleen and stomach. Infants, when fed, often intake excessive coldness, leading to cold energy accumulating in the spleen and stomach. The stomach is the sea for water and grains; when the spleen&#39;s energy is hindered, digestion is impaired. If the stomach&#39;s energy is harmonious, then milk and food can be digested, but cold damages the spleen, resulting in undigested food. A deep pulse indicates that the food is not transforming. There are also cases where the body heats up due to the harm from milk and food; the heat in the abdomen is particularly severe, causing extremely foul and sour stools, especially pronounced at night—a manifestation of accumulation that many do not understand.</p>
<p>For cold conditions, one can use digestion pills or lignum aloes pills. If there is heat at night and it cools down by morning, this is due to a combination of cold damage and food stagnation; one should take white pancakes, starting with a small quantity, followed by ginseng and perilla drink. For fevers, one can use earth bone skin decoction or Qin Jiao powder to reduce heat and calm the body. In cases of excess heat, Da Chai Hu decoction, minus the rhubarb, can also be used. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot;: When a person is ill with undigested food, how can it be distinguished? The teacher said: The pulse at the wrist is floating and large; when pressed, it feels hollow, indicating the presence of undigested food, which should be purged using Da Chengqi decoction. For wheezing and fever, Zi Shuang pills are the main treatment. For cold conditions, digestion pills are especially effective. This also treats food stagnation, where the limbs feel cold and the complexion appears bluish-black; it may require vomiting to recover. For those with phlegm, Wen Dan decoction can be modified and taken; once the phlegm is settled, spontaneous vomiting leads to recovery. For cold conditions, clove pills may be taken; white pancakes are also effective at relieving phlegm.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Imbalance of Stomach Qi and Coldness</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: When the stomach qi is imbalanced, the face appears pale and lacks vitality, there is a cold sensation in the mouth, no appetite, possible vomiting of water, weakness and thinness of the body, and abdominal pain. One should tonify the spleen and use Yihuang San to remedy this. For everyone, the stomach qi is fundamental; treating diseases is the same. Stomach qi can be either deficient or excessive; in excess, there can be symptoms of distention and internal heat, while deficiency can present as vomiting and lack of appetite. Treat deficiencies with tonics, and excesses with reductions; to achieve balance is the goal. Ping Wei San, Guanyin San, and Yinbai San are important formulas for strengthening the stomach and should not be neglected.</p>
<p><strong>Food Injury</strong></p>
<p>Hai Zang said: For injuries caused by food, one should use medicine to purge, paying close attention to what type of food caused the harm, recognizing that injuries can vary from hard to cold and hot. One should not hastily use highly toxic medicines like Ba Dou. Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang is suitable for the yangming and taiyang phases. Xing Xing San is for wind-heat conditions, with difficulties in the throat, disharmony in the spleen, dryness, and difficulty in urination, correlating to the shaoyang. Xiao Chai Hu Tang should be used when there are alternating chills and fever, slight pain in the chest and flanks, indicating the shaoyang phase. However, to discern the specific condition, one must rely on the pulse diagnosis.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Essentials for Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Xue Kai)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Not Feeding</strong>  </p>
<p>The classics say: The stomach is the sea of water and grains, and the major source of the six bowels. The energy, blood, and organs of the human body all arise from the energy of the stomach, hence the methods of Dongyuan emphasize the spleen and stomach as paramount. This is to say that nourishing the kidneys is not as effective as nourishing the spleen, reflecting this principle. In infants, even if they receive milk and food, the energy from water and grains is not fully complete; they rely primarily on the stomach&#39;s energy. If the stomach&#39;s energy is deficient, then all four organs will lack nourishment. Therefore, Danxi asserts that children often suffer from diseases of the liver and spleen. Symptoms include pale complexion, lack of luster in the eyes, cool breath in the mouth, refusal to eat and vomiting water, emaciation, and abdominal pain; these indicate deficiency and coldness of the stomach&#39;s energy. The treatment is to use Wuwei Yigong San or Liu Junzi Decoction. If the stool is not firm and there is also spleen deficiency, add dried ginger for warmth. If there is fullness and discomfort in the middle, indicating poor spleen function, add costus to disperse it. If the infant prefers cold and has constipation, this indicates excess heat in the stomach; use Xie Huang San to cool it down. If the fire of the life gate is weak and unable to nourish the earth, use Bawei Wan to supplement it. For congenital deficiency of stomach energy, this pill is also used. It is vital that when the true yang of the lower body is abundant, it naturally generates the spleen&#39;s essence above, thus effectively warming and steaming the water and grains.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Habitual Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The movement of the energies of heaven and earth has notable distinctions between the north and south; likewise, the illnesses of children vary in these regions. In the north, it is common for children to suffer from habitual illnesses, with a rate of about eighty to ninety percent; whereas in the south, the occurrence is only a few percent at most. What causes this difference? It is mainly because the water and soil in the south are weak, and the diet is soft and easy to digest, resulting in fewer illnesses. In contrast, the water and soil in the north are rich and solid, and the staple food is hard, making digestion more difficult, which leads to the emergence of such illnesses, often due to disharmony of the spleen and stomach. Therefore, Dongyuan emphasized that the spleen and stomach are crucial to a person&#39;s health; when they are harmonious, no illness arises, but if they are deficient, a multitude of diseases can manifest.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Children&#39;s spleen and stomach are naturally delicate; their organs are still tender. Many mothers are unaware of the methods to care for them, focusing only on indulgent love without considering the flavors of salty, sour, sweet, or fatty foods. They disregard cold fruits and vegetables, sticky rice balls, and greasy fried foods, allowing children to satisfy their desires and eat excessively, which harms the spleen and stomach. Once the spleen and stomach are damaged, they cannot digest grains and water; undigested food then stagnates and causes fever. If the fever persists too long, it drains the vital energy. When vital energy is deficient, it cannot circulate the blood, leading to blood stagnation and accumulation, which may manifest as clots lodged between the ribs. These can grow larger with time, assuming shapes like coins, turtles, snakes, or even organs like liver or lungs, varying in length and size. Internally, there are blood vessels connected, and externally, the blood tends to coil. These vessels lead directly to the lower back, opposite the navel, coexisting with an artery, which is the root of the ailment. The blood circulation in a person&#39;s body is continuous, flowing day and night. Blood circulates through the muscles, entering through pores and leading to stagnation.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Indeed, the oddities grow with the nourishment of blood, while the evils flourish with the support of blood. Thus, the righteous qi becomes increasingly weak, and the blood becomes more desiccated. This manifests as tidal fevers, leading to various illnesses: some experience profuse sweating from the head, or pulsations under the chest and neck, or distended bellies with prominent veins; hair may become brittle and stand on end, or the face may turn yellow and skin thin, limbs may become dry and withered. </p>
<p>If this condition persists over time, toxic energy will emerge, resulting in various symptoms. Some may develop tooth and gum sores with halitosis, or swollen faces and ulcers on the mouth and nose; others may have sores that ooze pus and bleed, or limbs that swell with abdominal bloating and breathlessness; some may experience alternating chills and fevers, resembling intermittent fevers; others may suffer from phlegm, coughing, and heat, with nosebleeds and vomiting of blood; there are those who may have diarrhea, dysentery, and conditions leading to prolapse or heaviness; or they may endure abdominal pain and hernias. All these ailments arise from the assault of toxicity and oddities.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The disease manifests in various forms, making it difficult to fully describe. It is akin to a life-threatening condition, one that cannot be cured by a single method or remedy. </p>
<p>To treat it, first apply acupuncture to sever its roots, preventing the blood from entering the tendons, so that the condition no longer has blood to sustain it, and it will naturally deteriorate. Externally, use ointments, while internally administer medicinal pills. Generally, it is advisable to strengthen the spleen and nourish the qi to address the root cause, while clearing heat and dissolving lumps to treat the symptoms, thus addressing both root and branch.</p>
<p>Moreover, one must carefully balance the treatment according to the child&#39;s strength or weakness and the severity of the illness. If the child is strong but the illness is mild, the remedies for symptoms should be greater than those for the root; if weak and the illness is severe, the remedies for the root should be more than those for the symptoms. Typically, remedies like Fei&#39;er Wan, Wu Jin Wan, Ai Wei Wan, and Qian Jin Bao Tong Wan serve as balanced treatments that both attack and supplement, appropriate for selection based on the diagnosis. After acupuncture, substantial benefits can be achieved. Physicians treating this condition must investigate thoroughly!<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Book of Young Infants&quot; states: The ailments encountered by infants are all due to irregular nursing practices, excessive consumption of cold and hard foods, leading to the spleen and stomach being unable to digest properly and causing stagnation in the central region. Externally, they may be harmed by wind and cold, or may have slept at night without proper covering, resulting in headaches, a pale face, fever, slightly swollen eyelids, abdominal pain and bloating, cold feet with a hot stomach, a preference for sleep with a dazed spirit, and a lack of appetite. They may experience vomiting, belching, sour swallowing, and foul-smelling stools, indicating harm from accumulation; however, sometimes there may be watery diarrhea like freshly squeezed vegetable juice, resulting from shock followed by accumulation, with irritability and persistent fussiness, known as &quot;shocked accumulation.&quot; Pediatric practitioners should treat them based on the severity and nature of the symptoms.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Spleen</strong></p>
<p>The spleen governs stagnation; when it is functional, there is stagnation with heat and thirst, while when it is deficient, it leads to vomiting and diarrhea, giving rise to wind. Spleen disease presents as stagnation, drowsiness, and diarrhea, with a lack of appetite.</p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, the face appears pale, the eyes lack vitality, the breath from the mouth and nose is cold, the body is thin and weak, there is water regurgitation and abdominal pain, and there is disinterest in dairy and food. Use Yi Huang San to nourish the spleen, and after that, use Tiao Zhong Wan for regulation. </p>
<p>In cases where there is a cold sensation in the hands and feet due to wind, it indicates spleen deficiency. First, use Yi Huang San to replenish the spleen, and then use Dai Qing Gao to disperse the wind. </p>
<p>Spleen diseases manifest in all four seasons and should be treated similarly to other organs. A right condition is easy to treat, while a wrong one is difficult to treat. Spleen deficiency manifests with a red face and yellowish eyes. The five organs interact oppositely, thus treatment should be according to the symptoms.</p>
<p>The spleen governs dampness, leading to excessive diarrhea and drowsiness, and a heavy body feeling. When the spleen suffers from damp, bitter foods should be consumed to dry it out. </p>
<p>If there is excessive diarrhea with red and yellow, sleep with eyes closed, use Xie Huang San. If there is deficiency, resulting in white diarrhea and sleep with eyes open, use Bai Zhu San. </p>
<p>If the liver invades the spleen, it may lead to wind, diarrhea, and vomiting; use Fu Ling Ban Xia Tang for treatment. When the heart invades the spleen, it presents as deficiency causing heat and heavy body resulting in diarrhea; use Qiang Huo Huang Qin Cang Zhu Gan Cao Tang. </p>
<p>If the lungs invade the spleen, there may be excess leading to capable eating but difficulty with bowel movements and vomiting; prepare Bing Lang Da Huang Tang and use Ting Li Wan. </p>
<p>If the kidneys invade the spleen, it may cause slight pathogenic effects with coldness and diarrhea; use Li Zhong Wan or similar treatments. </p>
<p>For any spleen illness, one must first examine the conditions of the liver and heart to assess their strengths and weaknesses, tracing the source of the problem before proceeding with treatment.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The liver is the spirit of the spleen, and the heart is the mother of the spleen. When liver qi is abundant, spirit energy prevails; when heart qi is deficient, the spleen&#39;s vitality is insufficient. Therefore, one should use methods to soothe liver qi and enhance heart qi. What is excessive should be restrained to diminish, and what is deficient should be nourished, hence the existence of two medicines: one to subdue spleen qi and another to benefit heart qi. By examining the pulse, if both the liver and heart organs are harmonious, this indicates a disease arising from the spleen itself, and treatment should be based on assessing its deficiency or excess.</p>
<p>If the evidence shows excess, the disease is due to excess pathogenic energy and deficient physiological energy. If the complexion is pale, there is vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain, and the mouth and nose feel cold, this indicates cold water injuring the earth (spleen), suitable for using Yi Huang San. If the face is bluish and lips dark, with vomiting and diarrhea, and the hands and feet are cold, this indicates coldness from spleen deficiency, suited for using Gan Jiang Li Zhong Tang. If the complexion is sallow and the hands and feet are not cold, this indicates weakness of the spleen, suitable for using Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>If one experiences wind-heat with cold limbs, phlegm cough, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, this indicates deficiency of spleen and lungs. Use the Wumei Yigong San to strengthen the spleen qi, adding Fangfeng and Shengma to expel external pathogens. If it arises during the hours of the Tiger or Rabbit, use Liujun San and Chaihu with Shengma to tonify the spleen and balance the liver.</p>
<p>Yellowish complexion indicates the natural color of the spleen. A reddish face suggests that fire generates earth, which is favorable; a bluish face indicates that wood overcomes earth, which is unfavorable. One should balance what is overcoming and tonify the original qi for best results.</p>
<p>The spleen is troubled by dampness; therefore, bitter foods should be consumed to dry it up, such as Atractylodes. If the spleen is in need of relief, one should eat sweet foods to soothe it, such as Licorice. To tonify with sweetness, use Ginseng. To purge with bitterness, use Coptis.</p>
<p>For spleen deficiency, tonify with sweet items like licorice and dates; if no other symptoms are present, use the Qian&#39;s Yihuang San for nourishment. In deficiency, one should tonify the mother; the heart is the mother of the spleen, so supplement the heart with roasted salt.</p>
<p>For spleen excess, use bitter orange to purge it; if there are no other symptoms, use Qian&#39;s Xiehuang San for relief. In excess, one should purge the child; the lungs are the child of the spleen, so use Mulberry bark to purge the lungs.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Weak Spleen Leads to Fatigue</p>
<p>The spleen possesses the tranquil virtue of the Earth, yet operates with the vigorous energy of the Heaven. The stomach, being yang, governs qi; the spleen, being yin, governs blood. The stomach absorbs and receives, while the spleen facilitates transformation and transportation. One absorbs and one transforms, generating essence and qi, with the clear energy rising and the turbid matter descending. It absorbs the five grains and transforms them into fluids; the clear essence nourishes, while the turbid matter protects. When yin and yang are thus balanced, it is referred to as the key. Therefore, in Dongyuan&#39;s view, the spleen and stomach are the foundation of the five organs. When the spleen qi is weak, the commands of vigorous operation do not manifest, and the function of transformation and generation is hindered, leading to excessive sleeping and fatigue. One should warm and tonify the spleen; when the spleen qi is robust, the clear yang energy of the viscera rises, facilitating movement, thereby eliminating fatigue. The Haizang method uses the Four Gentlemen Decoction, adding patchouli, cardamom, and pinellia, with doubled white atractylodes, and decocted with ginger and jujube, which is indeed a good method. If the spleen is deficient and sleep is excessive with many dreams, it indicates deficiency of heart blood and excess fire. Hence, it is advised to soothe the mind and nourish the blood.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If there is phlegm due to deficiency of heart and spleen energy, one should use ginseng, schisandra, and poria to tonify heart energy, and angelica, peony root, and sour jujube seed to nourish heart blood, along with tangerine peel and pinellia to resolve phlegm. If the cause is deficiency of spleen and lung energy with phlegm in the chest, use the Bai Zhu Yi Qi Decoction to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and Dan Xing Tian Zhu Wan to transform phlegm. If the issue arises from food stagnation, use the Si Junzi Decoction to benefit the spleen, and hawthorn and shenqu to digest food. If caused by spleen deficiency leading to excessive sleepiness, use the Wu Wei Yi Gong San to supplement spleen energy, and angelica and peony to generate spleen blood. Peony should be stir-fried with alcohol; otherwise, its sour cold nature may harm the spleen, thus employing false heat to counteract false cold. If a nursing mother drinks alcohol, causing the child to become drowsy and intoxicated, use dried ginger and tangerine peel to brew a decoction to relieve this; otherwise, add dried kudzu to the Yi Gong San for recovery. </p>
<p>For disharmony of the spleen and stomach, the Si Junzi prescription is enhanced with double the amount of white atractylodes, and ginger and jujube are boiled together. If the spleen is burdened, add half a tael each of costus, cardamom, and ginseng to the Si Junzi Decoction for boiling. For weakness of the spleen and stomach with excessive lethargy, add stir-fried pinellia and shenqu in equal parts to the Si Junzi Decoction, along with a small amount of winter melon seeds to be boiled together.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>宿食 (Accumulated Food)</strong></p>
<p>In cases of fever from cold damage, the heat from ingested food is particularly severe in the abdomen, accompanied by extremely sour and foul-smelling feces, and a humid heat at night, which notably indicates the harm from retained accumulation. For infants with undigested food, their stomach receives water and grains, but their spleen lacks the strength to process it due to their young age and inability to moderate intake, resulting in stagnation. Substances like Shenqu (a fermentation starter) and malt are known to harm the generation of vital energy in the stomach, let alone advancing to more potent substances like Sanleng (Rhizoma Sparganii) and Ezhum (Curcuma), or even stronger ones like Qianniuzi (Vigna unguiculata), Dahuang (Rhubarb), and Baduzi (Semen Crotonis). When the spleen&#39;s energy is first harmed by food, followed by more damage from medicine, and the energy has already escaped through purgation, how much is left to sustain? Therefore, medicines intended to expel food should not be used excessively; especially, those meant to purge accumulated substances must be carefully considered regarding whether the condition truly necessitates purging or not before use. According to Qian (Qian&#39;s) discussion on undigested food, it is due to cold in the spleen and stomach preventing digestion, thus support for the spleen and the primary benefits of Yi Huang San (a remedy) should be emphasized.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p>
<h3>Accumulation of Cold and Heat from Food</h3>
<p>When a child has food accumulation, it is due to the spleen and stomach being deficient and cold, causing milk and food to not be digested, resulting in accumulation over time. The symptoms manifest as fever at night and coolness by morning, accompanied by abdominal pain and distension. There may be vomiting with sour belching, cold feet with a hot belly, a preference for sleep, and lethargy, with foul-smelling stools. If there are prior symptoms along with cold and heat, it is termed food accumulation with cold and heat. If the food is located above the stomach, it should be vomited; if it is below the stomach, it should be expelled. Abdominal pain and distension that worsen upon pressing should be purged. If the pain persists after purging, but stops upon pressing, it requires tonification. </p>
<p>If there is a combination of food injury and cold, it should first be resolved with Ginseng and Perilla Decoction. If there is severe heat leading to constipation, it should first be resolved with Major Bupleurum Decoction. If there is no external invasion, but only food injury that is not severe, it can be treated with Baohe Pills. The spleen is the organ of absolute yin, thus conditions affecting the spleen show heat at night; if heat is accompanied by cold, it indicates a situation where the stronger defeats the weaker. If undigested food is resolved, the cold and heat will cease; if the food is already digested and then tonified, the cold and heat will heal. </p>
<p>If both hands and feet are cold and there is a desire for warm food and drink, this indicates cold in the central region and requires warming. If there is an urge to defecate but nothing comes out, it suggests spleen qi deficiency that needs to be uplifted. If diarrhea occurs at night or in the early morning, both the spleen and kidneys are deficient and can be treated with Four Divine Pills. When hands and feet are hot and there is thirst for water, it indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, treated with Xie Huang San. For constipation, use Major Bupleurum Decoction. When hands and feet are hot, but there is no thirst and the stools are not hard, use Bai Zhu San. Additionally, treat abdominal pain and distension, and the accumulation of pain and stagnation.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Food Accumulation and Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>When one overeats, the spleen is harmed; with a slightly weak spleen, digestion becomes difficult, leading to accumulation that can result in dysentery. There may be mild abdominal pain. First, regulate the stomach&#39;s energy, then treat the accumulation, which will stop the dysentery and the root of the ailment will be resolved. Harmonizing the center, dispersing and replenishing to nourish the spleen is important. San Ling San and Wu Xi Wan assist the spleen in metabolizing accumulations, while Chen Xiang Bing Lang Wan and Shou Zhong Tang help with eating and stopping dysentery. One should also avoid consuming cold, sticky, and similar items to prevent recurrence.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Accumulated Illness Can Be Treated: Nine Cases</p>
<p>Facial swelling indicates accumulation. Accumulation relates to the spleen. The spleen governs the flesh of the body, so it reflects on the face, indicating it is a spleen-related accumulation. The spleen corresponds to the earth; earth has no fixed form, which is why swelling varies at different times of the day. If swelling appears mainly in the morning, it suggests that during sleep the spleen is not functioning well, leading to facial swelling. If this condition follows an illness, it indicates an accumulation of deficiency, which requires remedies to regulate the spleen, resolve the accumulation, and promote Qi.</p>
<p>When the face is flat against the ground while lying down, it suggests accumulation. Why is it flat against the ground? The accumulation is in the spleen and is of a cold nature. Why do we know this? The spleen thrives in earth, indicating it is spleen-related. The cold nature is associated with Yin, suggesting that cold, hard food has caused it, thus requiring warming remedies to resolve the accumulation and Qi.</p>
<p>Abdominal distension is an accumulation, and it is located in the lungs. How do we know this? The lungs govern Qi and should receive the accumulation; when Qi turns cold, abdominal distension arises along with fullness and urgent discomfort, indicating it resides in the lungs. Thus, addressing Qi regulation first is appropriate, followed by further Qi adjustments.</p>
<p>When urine resembles oil, it indicates accumulation situated in the small intestine. How do we know this? The accumulation involves the spleen, which should connect to the heart. If the heart is unimpeded, it flows into the small intestine, which is the organ of the heart; hence, it is known to be in the small intestine, resulting in turbid urine resembling rice washing or oily substances.</p>
<p>Yellowing of the skin indicates accumulation, which signifies accumulated Qi harming the heart.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The heart governs the blood vessels and influences the hair on the entire body. If it is affected by accumulated qi, the hair will turn yellow, indicating an injury to the heart. It is advisable to administer a cooling laxative and prescribed medicinal herbs. This individual is bound to have intermittent fevers.</p>
<p>Red and white dysentery results from accumulation in the lungs, caused by external factors affecting the intestines and possibly due to cold injuries. How do we know this? The lungs belong to the west, governed by the metal element (geng and xin), which appears white first, followed by red; this indicates external pathogens. Thus, we know the lungs transmit to the intestines, leading to red and white dysentery. It is appropriate to administer herbs for regulating qi afterward.</p>
<p>When both eyes are yellow and red with a blue tint, it indicates accumulation in the liver. How do we know this? The liver is associated with the east, governed by the wood element (jia and yi), which is blue, yet affected by accumulated qi that manifests as yellow and red. The blue tint in the eyes indicates they are connected to the five organs, with the liver being the main source. If there is accumulation affecting the spleen, it causes the eyes to appear blue, reflecting the liver&#39;s vitality. If it affects the gallbladder, the person may experience a bitter taste and should avoid food; it is advisable to use cooling herbs to alleviate this.</p>
<p>Generalized swelling throughout the body indicates accumulation, but not in the organs—only in the bowels. How do we know this? The swelling occurs when the accumulation was previously affected; upon administering medicine, it does not involve the organs, thus swelling manifests beneath the skin. It is best to use herbal laxatives to address the accumulation and then restore balance.</p>
<p>Frequent watery diarrhea with white stools indicates accumulation due to cold in the spleen. How do we know this? The spleen is responsible for transformation, and when affected by cold, it leads to accumulation in the spleen that results in cold, watery diarrhea producing white stools. Thus, we identify it in the spleen, and it is advisable to first warm the area and afterward use restorative herbs.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Untreatable Conditions: Six</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Rapid Breathing</strong>: This indicates lung accumulation. The lungs govern Qi; if breathing becomes rapid, it&#39;s a sign of lung failure. The person&#39;s face will be pale, lacking color, hence untreatable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dark Face</strong>: This indicates kidney accumulation. A person with a dark face is experiencing kidney failure. They become indifferent to good or bad, their eyes lose luster, and they will only last a day before death.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Expelling Hot Air</strong>: This signifies nourishing accumulation. If left untreated, it indicates a fatal blood failure. Blood supports the heart; if the heart cannot nourish, hot air will continue to escape.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sores on Hands and Feet</strong>: This indicates defensive accumulation. The defense, or Qi, is disrupted. If stomach Qi is deficient, sores appear on the hands and feet. If the defense fails, Qi will not return, leading to death within half a day.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Nausea and Dry Heaving</strong>: This indicates stomach accumulation. Why not treat it? The stomach governs digestion; if it&#39;s overheated, it causes nausea and vomiting, hence not treatable. Such a person will struggle with undigested milk, cannot eat, and will experience dry heaving, with a complexion pale yellow and lacking blood color.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chronic Diarrhea, then Constipation followed by Diarrhea</strong>: This indicates that accumulation is gnawing and rotting the spleen. How to recognize spleen rot? The person will pass white stools due to undigested food, then upon constipation, will pass red-black feces and die, indicating spleen rot, thus untreatable.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Accumulation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In children, accumulation arises from stagnation of visceral qi, gathering in one place and thus termed accumulation. The heart is the upper support, located above the navel, where it attacks the heart from above and the stomach from below; the spleen creates stagnation in the upper stomach; the liver generates fat qi to the left of the navel; the lungs cause breathing difficulties to the right of it; and the kidneys create disturbances below the navel. Each has its movements; these are not formed by food but by the accumulation of qi. The organs are related to yin, hence they remain in one place without movement. </p>
<p>Accumulation refers to the gathering of qi in the six bowels. The bowels are associated with the intestines, where the yang qi flows continuously, which is why its accumulation does not remain fixed, leading to abdominal pain. Signs of accumulation include a pale, thin, poor complexion, difficulty gaining muscle, swelling, and a tense abdomen, often due to water qi.</p>
<p>For accumulations within vacuity, any sudden fright leads to further accumulation, resulting in dark and foul feces. Accumulation in vacuity occurs due to overeating, which leads to both diarrhea and vomiting; hence the condition gradually worsens, and the illness remains unresolved, thus termed accumulation in vacuity. Moreover, if there is accumulation that shifts frequently but does not fully resolve, it leads to further latent conditions, being likewise termed accumulation within vacuity. If fright prompts a purge, the feces follow the fright and turn dark. Similarly, food accumulation forms feces into lumps. </p>
<p>In cases of malnutrition (dysentery), the vacuity causes accumulation, as the illness leads to diarrhea but does not resolve the malnutrition, resulting in pale-colored feces.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>For infants suffering from accumulation disorders, if symptoms are felt for a day or two, first use the Bai Shang drink to lift the obstruction. Then take the Dang Gui powder, boiled with water and ginger, to gently stimulate the stagnation. After that, administer Wu Xi Wan and Liu Sheng Wan in larger doses to relieve and unblock. Finally, use Yun Qi San to adjust and replenish.</p>
<p>In cases of stagnation, it&#39;s essential to distinguish between deficiency and excess. Moreover, children vary in constitution—thin or plump, short or tall, dark or light—across different regions and times, and thus cannot be treated uniformly. My approach is that those with substantial conditions may take the Jin Shi Wan, while those who are weak, pale, and emaciated should use the Fei Er Wan.</p>
<p>At the onset, when the vital energy is not yet depleted, if there is abdominal distension or pain and difficulty with urine and bowel movements, first administer Bai Bing Zi or Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan. Afterward, mix with Bai Zhu San or Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If thirst increases, add Gan Ge, and if vomiting occurs, include Ban Xia.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If the heat does not recede, and there are symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea with loss of appetite, it indicates a harm to the spleen and stomach, treated with Six Gentlemen Decoction. If the hands and feet are cold and there is a preference for hot soup, this indicates a deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, to which add roasted ginger and costus. If the complexion is pale yellow, with no brightness in the eyes, both the spleen and lungs are weak, and the treatment is Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. For abdominal pain with diarrhea or dysentery, or difficulty in urination, use Si Ni San. If there is fever with evening chills or ongoing diarrhea, it indicates a sinking of spleen qi; with thirst, unbalanced bowel movements, and a desire for a transformation of the disease, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, combined with Fei Er Wan. The classics state: where evil gathers, its qi must be deficient; if it lingers, the disease becomes tangible. Attention must be given to regulating the spleen as the primary measure, supported by dispersing and guiding methods. This aligns with the ancient saying about nourishing the righteous to eliminate what is unwanted.</p>
<p>As for milk accumulation:</p>
<p>The signs are simply vomiting and regurgitating milk with a foul smell, due to excessive crying; hastily feeding the infant leads to stagnation. Mr. Mao first used Clove Powder to regulate the stomach, then employed Niu Huang Pill to remove the milk accumulation, followed by Yun Qi San; regular use of Jian Pi San leads to recovery. </p>
<p>In cases of milk lumps, the signs are a bluish-yellow complexion, intense thirst and heat, frequent vomiting of milk, development of sores in the mouth while gradually becoming yellow and thin, and internal abdominal masses that do not disperse. This results from the wet nursing mother having irregular eating and drinking habits, excessive drunkenness or fullness, which impacts the infant; or if the nursing mother consistently lies in one position, preventing the infant from turning, and the child also falls asleep, leading to the milk stagnating, predominantly on the side, resulting in blockages that become painful.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Food Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The belly feels hard and hot compared to other areas, and may cause diarrhea or vomiting due to overeating and sleeping right after a meal. Mr. Mao uses Niu Huang Wan to eliminate the accumulation, then employs Yun Qi San for adjustment, and regularly takes Wan Ling Wan for recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms include a yellow-white complexion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, crying in distress, and diarrhea resembling crab paste. This is due to the disharmony of Ying and Wei, and the discord between the two energies, which develops over time. Mr. Mao uses Wan Ling Wan, Yun Qi San, Xing Pi San, and Jian Pi San, among others, for combined treatment. The &quot;Secret Records&quot; states: to treat children&#39;s Qi disorders, take San Leng San and make it into porridge with rice flour for the nursing mother to consume. For children under ten years old and infants less than a hundred days old, regardless of issues like convulsions or other ailments, this treatment is remarkably effective.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The complexion appears yellowish like soil, or with a pallid and swollen appearance. There may be slight pain above the navel, a hot belly, reduced appetite, and pain in the navel and abdomen immediately after eating, with undigested food and slight feverishness in the head. This is due to having eaten hard or cold substances, injuring the spleen. To treat this, first use Qing Jin Wan to clear the accumulation in the spleen, then apply Yun Qi San and Xing Pi San for adjustment. Regularly taking Jian Pi San and Wan Ling Wan leads to recovery.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p>
<h3>Shock Accumulation</h3>
<p>Sometimes clear water spills like raw rice juice, which occurs due to injury and leads to accumulation. It causes agitation and frequent annoyance, often arising from innate anger, referred to as shock accumulation. First, alleviate the shock, then address the accumulation. For shock, use Wuling Powder or Baijie Powder; for accumulation, use Sanleng Powder or Wuxi Pill, along with Sanjie Powder, brewed with fried Shenqu and ginger decoction. Xingspi Powder and Chenxiang Biling Pill can calm the shock and transform the accumulation, strengthening the energy and harmonizing the stomach. Additionally, avoid cold milk, and natural balance will follow.</p>
<h3>Virtual Accumulation</h3>
<p>Symptoms include slight heat throughout the body, lack of appetite, dullness, a sensation of being half-asleep, and a feeling of warmth in the abdomen with cold feet. This often arises after severe vomiting, diarrhea, or illness. Mr. Mao first uses Qingjin Pill to remove the accumulation, then employs Yungqi and Xingspi Powder for regulation. Regularly taking Wanling Pill and Baotong Pill will lead to recovery.</p>
<h3>Real Accumulation</h3>
<p>Symptoms include constipation, wind poison abscesses, throat closure, mumps, and gurgling saliva in the throat. Mr. Mao first employs Duoming Powder to expel the hot saliva, then uses Yungqi Powder and Xingspi Powder for regulation. Regularly taking Niuhuang Paste, Tianzhuhuang Powder, and Zhenxin Pill will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Xuān Pǐ</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Máo discusses conditions in children aged five months to seven years who have masses in the abdomen, resembling the size of apricot kernels or eggs, that cause intermittent pain. These conditions are classified as follows: pain under the left rib is called &quot;Xuān Qì,&quot; while pain under both ribs is known as &quot;Pǐ Qì.&quot; Treating with a combination of Pēng É Zhú San and Jiàn Pí Yǐn will lead to recovery. If one observes dark complexion, direct gaze, black stool, cold nose and mouth, cold hands and feet, and refusal to eat, this is often fatal.</p>
<p>Mr. Qi states that in children, conditions such as Pǐ are due to undigested food, lingering in the abdomen, compounded by fluctuations in temperature, drinking water, or wheezing and coughing, resembling intermittent fever. If not treated early, it may lead to more severe conditions. Because of the involvement of Pǐ, children refuse to eat, resulting in weak spleen and stomach, causing heat to arise. Excessive drinking then washes out the intestines and stomach, leading to loss of fluids, which hinders the proper transformation of food, with a pulse that is deep and thin; the lack of food weakens the spleen and stomach, leading to inability to lift limbs, and various ailments can arise, resulting in wasting and further complications.</p>
<p>Rén Zhāi states: Pǐ is a membrane encasing fluid, lodged at the sides near the ribs, causing intermittent pain. Pǐ can trigger fevers and can produce chills and heat; thus, those suffering from malaria often accumulate yellow fluid in the abdomen, eventually resulting in Pǐ, and persistent chills and fevers can lead to this ailment. When a child&#39;s organs are balanced and harmonious, with proper flow of nutrients, even with excess water intake, they do not become ill.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If there is a disorder in breastfeeding, with the three burners being obstructed, this leads to stagnation of fluids, and the intestines and stomach are unable to function properly. If cold air attacks, it can gather and form a mass. For mild cases, use the Daodi Mu Xiang Pills, and for severe cases, use the Qu Pi Pills. </p>
<p>Zeng says: When infants are born, their endowments are not yet complete. If there is a lack of care in swaddling and a lack of regulation in breastfeeding, coupled with external injuries from the six excesses and internal weakness of the five organs, cold accumulates and stagnates in the spleen, unable to transform, leading to the formation of masses. These masses may protrude beneath the ribs, either to the left or right. The ailments arise from accumulated stagnation, causing cold and heat symptoms, abdominal pain, or cooler days and warmer nights.</p>
<p>The treatment method: For those with excess qi, it is necessary to warm and correct the stomach qi before administering Wu Xi Pills or Crystal Pills. After about three doses, stop with thin porridge and wait until the symptoms disappear before using tonifying agents. For those with qi deficiency, first regulate the spleen and stomach, stabilize the true essence, and slightly correct the complexion. Increase food intake and use the previous method for treatment. If there is severe deficiency, gradually dissolve with San Leng Powder or Hua Pi Pills, accommodating yin and yang, aiming for balance. However, first support, then drain, following the method of receiving and expelling to eliminate cold stagnation.</p>
<p>If the face is yellow, lips white, hair stands up, and the body is emaciated, this indicates extreme deficiency, and one should not hastily drain but rather use medicine slowly for digestion and regulation. If the child is small, ensure the wet nurse regularly consumes Ho Xiang decoction, allowing the medicine to pass through the milk, which is also of slight assistance.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>This phlegm is inside the abdomen and differs from the phlegm below the heart; it is advisable to take food pills regularly. However, since food pills contain croton seeds, can they be taken frequently? Gansui is highly toxic and causes diarrhea as if the rivers are breaking through; unless one is extremely robust, in a very dangerous state, or has a great amount of excess fluid—these three conditions must all be met—it should not be used lightly. Those who consider it a primary treatment for phlegm accumulation are mistaken. </p>
<p>If phlegm has persisted for a long time, appetite will decrease, causing a deficiency in the spleen and qi. If left untreated for a long time, the focus must first be on strengthening the stomach qi, so that effective nourishment can eliminate the accumulation by itself. If one desires to attack the accumulation directly, not only can it not be effectively removed, but it may also damage the spleen and earth, leading to various other symptoms due to the depletion of the spleen. Each case should be treated according to various symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Dietary Accumulation in Infants</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of accumulation in infants differ. Accumulation is caused by qi; it should not be treated lightly. When the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, food cannot be digested properly, and if breast milk is not administered appropriately, it leads to harm. Symptoms include a healthy body that feels warm, a warm breath in the mouth, a pale face, a swollen abdomen, dull eyes, excessive white in the eyes, a tendency to sleep, limbs that are limp, aversion to food, foul-smelling stools, or vomiting and diarrhea, indicating that food cannot be digested. Stabilizing medications should be used to resolve these issues; one should not hastily resort to strong medications. </p>
<p>In infants with strong qi and a robust spleen and stomach, digestive recovery can occur gradually. However, those with weak qi and a frail spleen and stomach will easily incur harm with even slight disruptions in nourishment.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Prescription for Zishuang Pill</strong></p>
<p>This prescription is effective for treating children&#39;s fever, headaches, poor digestion, abdominal distension, or cramping in the lower abdomen, as well as difficulties with urination and defecation, or frequent urges to defecate. If the child shows no other ailments but has overeaten, fails to restrain themselves, has irregular nursing, or experiences fright and alternating chills and fever, this pill will remedy the condition. If symptoms persist, it can be taken again. If a child desires to defecate, it indicates an internal issue; when their appetite decreases, and they exhibit discomfort and night crying, it signifies a disturbance in the abdomen, and this pill should be used exclusively, without resorting to other medicines. Its efficacy has been confirmed repeatedly, and the secrets of this remedy are not widely shared. </p>
<p>In the detailed instructions mentioned, any reference to taking the purple pill corresponds to the four ingredients outlined in the previous sections. If the purple pill does not alleviate the issue, then one should take the red pill, which works more rapidly. Although this prescription does not explicitly include the red pill, the use of cinnabar indicates a stronger effect than the purple pill; it is suspected that this refers to the red pill.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Ba Dou Powder:</strong> 18 zhu of Ba Dou and Rui He Ren each, 10 zhu of Mai Men Dong, 5 zhu of Gan Cao, 2 zhu each of Gan Sui and Zhu Sha Fei, 8 zhu each of Mu Li and La.

<p><strong>Liqing Heat-clearing Decoction</strong> [from &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot;]</p>
<p>Used for treating children&#39;s food accumulation with stagnation heat, manifesting on the skin with alternating fever. It primarily regulates the interior and clears the heat of the yangming.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fried Atractylodes - 1 qian</li>
<li>Hawthorn - 1 qian</li>
<li>Fried White Peony - 1 qian</li>
<li>Fried Coptis - 7 fen</li>
<li>Fried Bitter Orange - 7 fen</li>
<li>Chuanxiong - 7 fen</li>
<li>Fried Cyperus - 7 fen</li>
<li>Shengma - 7 fen</li>
<li>Pueraria - 1 qian 2 fen</li>
<li>Honey-fried Licorice - 3 fen</li>
<li>Licorice - 3 fen</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare by decocting with ginger water. If the food accumulation is resolved but the alternating fever persists, reduce Hawthorn, Bitter Orange, Cyperus, and Chuanxiong, and add 5 fen each of Ginseng, Astragalus, and Dried Tangerine Peel, along with an additional 2-3 fen of Atractylodes. If there is phlegm, add 6 fen of Pinellia.</p>
<p>Xue Ji states: If the symptoms indicate that the food accumulation is resolved but the heat does not recede, use Wuwei Yigong Powder to replenish stomach qi. If there are symptoms of vomiting and reduced appetite, use Si Junzi Decoction with Agastache and Pinellia to stabilize the qi in the stomach. If diarrhea occurs and lacks appetite, it’s advisable to use Liu Junzi Decoction with Shengma and Chaihu to tonify spleen qi. If diarrhea persists for a long time, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to boost yang qi.</p>
<p>For deficiencies and coldness, add roasted Ginger and Muxiang; if ineffective, assist with Sishen Pill to tonify spleen and kidney. If the body is thin with alternating fever, thirst, and irregular bowel movements, use Fei’er Pill to resolve dietary accumulation. </p>
<p>If the distinction between spleen qi deficiency and food accumulation is unclear, it is advisable to avoid any measures that cold or clear heat, as they may further harm the spleen and stomach, leading to challenging conditions to treat.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Ginseng Stomach Tranquil Powder</strong></p>
<p>This formula is used to treat weakness of the spleen and stomach, damage from excessive heat in milk and food, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ginseng: 1 qian</li>
<li>Astragalus: 2 qian</li>
<li>Raw licorice: 0.5 qian</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice: 0.5 qian</li>
<li>White peony root (stir-fried in wine): 0.7 qian</li>
<li>White poria: 0.4 qian</li>
<li>Aged orange peel: 0.3 qian</li>
<li>Stir-fried coptis: 0.2 qian</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind all ingredients into a powder. Dose: 2 qian each time, decocted in water.</p>
<p>Xue Ji says: According to Dongyuan, the Yi Huang Powder includes the spicy heat of clove and green tangerine peel, which is meant to counteract cold water&#39;s invasion of earth. If heat-damaging medicines like cassia seed cause harm to the spleen and stomach, or if summer heat injures the intake of milk and food leading to vomiting and diarrhea with a hot wind in the mouth and nose causing prolonged fright, this formula should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Yi Huang Powder</strong></p>
<p>This formula treats spleen deficiency leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite, with poor digestion of grains, fatigue, low energy, night-time bowel movements, wasting with night sweats, and drooling at the corners of the mouth.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aged orange peel: 1 liang</li>
<li>Clove: 2 qian</li>
<li>Haritaki (roasted and peeled): 0.5 liang</li>
<li>Green tangerine peel: 0.5 liang</li>
<li>Licorice (honey-fried): 0.5 liang</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind all ingredients into a powder. Dose: 1 qian each time, decocted in water.</p>
<p>Xue Ji says: In previous cases, if the spleen is deficient and cold or if cold water overcomes earth leading to vomiting and diarrhea, or if hands and feet are cold, or if phlegm rises with eyes half-open during sleep and there is a lack of desire for milk and food, this formula should be used. If the vomiting and diarrhea are due to spleen deficiency, use Six Gentleman Decoction with Chai Hu. If there is no response, or if the hands and feet are cold, it indicates true cold, and one should add wood fragrance and roasted ginger. If the issue arises from a wet nurse’s spleen deficiency and liver insult, one must treat with the previous formulas.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>If the wet nurse is extremely angry, it can lead to the child suffering from symptoms of illness. The mother should take a modified Gui Pi decoction. Wang Kentang said: Dongyuan states that Yan Xiaozhong compiled the Qian family&#39;s prescriptions to enhance Huang San for nourishing the earth. He also mentioned that when wind is strong, it must overcome the spleen&#39;s earth, so one must first strengthen the spleen. Those in ignorance do not discern the cold and heat within the spleen, treating all cases uniformly with spleen-nourishing medicines; they also fail to recognize that medicines containing cloves and citrus peels are pungent and warm, severely draining the lung&#39;s metal. How can one reverse the outflow in a case of spleen deficiency? It turns the cold water against the earth, causing cold-related vomiting, abdominal pain, greenish or white diarrhea, and a cold sensation in the mouth and nose. Huang San is the appropriate remedy for this condition. If, however, the illness arises from taking excessive hot medicines like ba dou, which harm the spleen and stomach, or if it is due to the heat accumulated during hot weather, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, with a hot sensation in the mouth and nose resulting in a state of chronic fright, it should not be used. Therefore, Ren Shen An Wei San should be prescribed.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Qian&#39;s Xiehuang Powder, also known as Xiepisan, treats spleen heat and tongue vomiting. </p>

<li>40 grams of Fangfeng</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation: Grind into a fine powder after lightly frying with honey wine. The dosage is one to two grams, to be decocted in water. </p>
<p>Xue Ji states: Based on the symptoms, if there is thirst with a preference for cold drinks, sleeping with eyes closed, and hands and feet feeling very hot, or if there is general yellowing of the body, it belongs to excess heat in the stomach channel, and Xiehuang Powder is appropriate. If there is thirst with a preference for soup, sleeping with eyes open, and hands and feet cold, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the stomach channel, appropriate for Yi Gong Powder. If the face is pale and the person frequently craves milk food, this suggests liver overacting on the spleen, and the remedy is the Secret Formula to Tonify the Spleen Decoction. If there is a red face with anxiety, body heat, and drowsiness, it indicates heart overacting on the spleen, appropriate for the Secret Formula to Calm the Spirit Pill. If the face is pale with wheezing, fatigue in the limbs, this indicates lung overacting on the spleen, appropriate for the Restore the Middle and Augment Qi Decoction. If there is blackened lips with diarrhea, and cold in the hands and feet, this indicates kidney overacting on the spleen, suitable for the Benefit Yellow Powder. After illness, if there is insufficient body fluids, dry mouth, and thirst, the Seven Flavor Bai Zhu Powder is recommended. If a nursing mother consumes rich foods that cause internal heat from emotional distress, her condition should be examined and treated.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Pingwei Powder</p>

<p>For a child’s disorder, take the peeled Li Ren (apricot kernel) and double kernels, remove the skin, and pound them together with dry flour. Form into cakes; if too dry, mix with plain water, shaping them to the size of the patient’s palm to make two cakes. Lightly roast them until they are yellow, but do not let them cook completely. Eat one on an empty stomach; it should be effective. If not effective, eat another one. Drinking hot congee can also aid efficiency. Efficiency is the measure. If by afternoon the condition doesn&#39;t improve, stop with vinegar rice. After passing, the patient should feel weak. If the illness has not fully resolved, based on what can be tolerated, take an additional dose after one or two days, limiting it to the end of the illness. For children, also gauge as needed. They must avoid eating dairy and beef or horse meat, as there will be no benefit. For those with severe illness, reduce the amount of Li Ren with flour; for lighter cases, adjust accordingly while still measuring strength. With repeated trials, efficacy is guaranteed, achieving remarkable results.</p>

<p>The &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; states: To treat children with intestinal issues, perform moxibustion three times an inch below each nipple. The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Tong&quot; mentions that for children with phlegm issues, apply moxibustion on the Zhang Men and along the spine; for accumulation and diarrhea issues, perform moxibustion seven times on both sides near the lower part of the eleventh vertebra, about one and a half inches apart. </p>
<p>Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng&quot; states that if a child&#39;s phlegm condition does not resolve after a long time, moxibustion seven times each on the Zhong Wan point and the two Zhang Men points is indicated. The Zhang Men point is located on the lateral side, directly outside the navel, at the edge of the ribcage below the left and right armpits. The child should lie sideways, bend one leg up and extend the other down, raising the arm to access the points. The Zhong Wan point is one inch below the upper abdominal point, four inches above the navel, located between the heart&#39;s covering bones and the navel itself. After finding the appropriate points, apply moxibustion seven times in total on the area around the navel and the mid-spine, without exception. </p>
<p>The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Jian&quot; explains that for phlegm treatment, the moxibustion points are in the center of the child&#39;s back, starting from the tailbone and feeling along the spine for two points where the blood vessels are active. For each point, place a three-wen copper coin on it and burn mugwort in the coin&#39;s hole, moxibustion seven times. These are the root points for phlegm, where blood flows. If moxibustion is applied properly, lesions will appear and effects can be seen; if it does not reach the blood vessels, then lesions will not appear and the treatment will be ineffective.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>Qian Yi in &quot;Pediatric Direct Method&quot; states: Cao Xuande&#39;s son, three years old, had a yellow complexion, intermittent fevers, lacked appetite while excessively drinking water, and could not stop vomiting after drinking milk. Various doctors believed it to be tidal fever and treated it with cattle bile pills and musk pills without improvement. When using a thirst-quenching decoction, he vomited. Qian concluded: &quot;A white cake should be given to clear the body, and then tonify the spleen.&quot; So, he ground up digestion pills, determining it was a form of accumulation. Eventually, the child recovered. Why? The lack of food and excessive drinking caused food to stagnate in the intestines, leading to intermittent fevers. Vomiting after taking thirst-quenching medicine happened due to the medicine clashing with the spleen; once purged, recovery followed.</p>
<p>Luo Tianyi in &quot;Precious Mirror of Health&quot; mentions: The overall governor of Zhen Ding, Dong Gong&#39;s eldest grandson, aged eleven, suffered from accumulation and hard masses under the left rib, a distended abdomen with visible veins, fevers, warm skin, coughing with spontaneous sweating, particularly severe in the afternoon, foul breath from dental issues, bleeding gums, and fatigue in the limbs, with reduced appetite; the illness was quite critical. The imperial physician Liu Zhong&#39;an was summoned for treatment and estimated recovery in about a hundred days. He was first given a dose of agarwood and sea sand pills, which expelled two or three bowel movements; the next day, he took a flatulence pill; after ten days, he repeated the agarwood and sea sand pills for relief, followed by another dose of the flatulence pills. This interchange continued for over a month, with the accumulation halving, and within a hundred days, he was fully recovered. In recent years, this ailment has become more common, and many have recovered; it is recorded to aid future patients.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>&quot;The Young Child&#39;s Formulas&quot; states: The young lady of Deputy Minister Zhang from the Ministry of Revenue has suffered from a long-standing accumulation of stagnation and blockages. She experiences a distended abdomen with strong heat, constipation, and a loss of appetite. All the doctors diagnosed her with a condition of deficient heat and fever. Some attributed her symptoms to a cold stomach, suggesting treatments for loss of appetite. However, her lack of eating naturally resulted in less urination and defecation. They considered treating her with remedies for malnutrition, but after trying various medicines without success, her condition had become dire, prompting them to request my assistance. Upon being asked which medicines should be taken, I advised them to use Gan Sui and Da Huang. They were alarmed, saying that previous doctors had only prescribed tonics. This young woman had not eaten or drunk for a long time; thus, it was not appropriate to stimulate her intestines and stomach. I replied, &quot;Those who trust me will live; those who oppose me will die.&quot; Zhang then inquired if there were alternative recipes without Gan Sui. I instructed them to administer the Da Cheng Qi Decoction immediately. After two doses, she recovered. The next day, upon examination, there was still some residual blockages, and it was certain that within a few days, the condition would reoccur. She needed to take the previous medicine again to eliminate the root cause. A few days later, when she indeed faced blockage again, with a distended abdomen and hardness, after taking the medicine once more, she was completely cured.</p>
<p>&quot;The Golden Mirror of Infant Care&quot; states: A child exhibited a pale yellow complexion and burped sour gas. After administering a dose of Ping Wei San, the accumulated food was rapidly digested. I mentioned that there was no need for many medicines, just regulate their diet for recovery. However, not believing this, they caused further food injuries, resulting in burping and sourness. They used other medicines to combat the stagnation, leading to increased vomiting and diarrhea, ultimately resulting in a critical situation. Such a pity!<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>A young child ate too much and vomited. After taking a remedy, there was blood in the vomit, and then he had bloody stools. His lips were pale and sometimes blue. When asked for the reason, I said: &quot;This is due to the deficiency of the spleen, which is overpowered by the liver.&quot; I instructed him to take the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; on an empty stomach. After a while, use &quot;Yigong Powder&quot; to regulate and nourish the middle energy, allowing the fluids and blood to return to their source and heal.</p>
<p>The &quot;Tirén Huibian&quot; states: &quot;Once there was a person who came from Guizhou and contracted malaria. The couple died one after the other, leaving behind two sons who were both ill, with lumps in their abdomen like melons, suffering painfully. I used rhubarb wine to wash it, combined with slightly roasted pepper, ground them into a fine powder and mixed them equally, forming honey pills the size of tung seeds. Each dose consisted of fifty pills, taken with musk water on an empty stomach. After ten doses, all the gas lumps disappeared. For children, smaller pills were used, while adults used larger ones. Initially, fifty pills were consumed, and afterward only twenty or thirty pills daily were taken. Avoid excessive doses; once 80% of the illness was alleviated, stop taking to allow complete recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Records&quot; notes: &quot;A young child had overeaten, developed a fever, and unusual lip movements. Remedies like &#39;Stomach Nourishing Decoction&#39;, bitter orange, coptis, and hawthorn were used, but the child experienced further abdominal bloating and afternoon fevers. Upon examination, the abdomen wasn’t painful. I believed that while previous medicines might have digested food, they harmed the spleen and stomach. I administered several doses of &#39;Liu Jun Zi Decoction&#39; and he recovered.&quot;<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>A small child had a food injury, experiencing wind-heat vomiting, with lips and mouth twitching. After taking a digestive and heat-clearing medicine, the food had digested, but the heat remained unchanged. I said: this is due to deficient stomach qi and excess heat. I used Four Gentlemen Decoction, Shengma, and Chaihu, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another small child had a pale face and suddenly showed slight movements of the lips. At times, the complexion turned yellow and green. After a long while, the lips, mouth, hands, and feet also showed slight movements. This was due to spleen deficiency being insulted by the liver. I used Wuwu Yigong Powder with added Diaoteng and Bai Fuzhi, and the complexion improved slightly. After two more doses, the movements of the lips and mouth ceased. I then used Yigong Powder with Shengma and Chaihu and achieved recovery.</p>
<p>For a small child with abdominal distension, I initially gave Erchen Tang, Zhi Shi, and Huang Lian, but the distension worsened. I diagnosed a deficiency of blood in the spleen. I used Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Dang Gui, and after several doses, the stomach qi gradually recovered. Then, in the morning, I used Yigong Powder with Shengma, and in the evening, I used Yigong Powder with Dang Gui, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A small child under one year old experienced shortness of breath and wheezing, had a poor appetite for milk, and occasionally vomited it. The child appeared emaciated, indicating spleen damage and food accumulation. I first used Six Gentlemen Decoction with Shan Zha and Zhi Shi, and the child gradually improved. Later, milk and food injuries caused vomiting and diarrhea with thirst. After waiting two days without relief, I first gave Wei Ling Gao to treat the vomiting and diarrhea, followed by Qi Wei Bai Zhu San to generate stomach qi, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>A young child suffered from a distended belly and took medicine to eliminate stagnation. I believed that when both the physical and pathological qi are excessive, purging should be done, not tonifying; when both are deficient, tonifying should be done, not purging. The previous symptoms indicated a deficiency in both the physical and pathological aspects, and merely tonifying the middle qi would not lead to recovery. Disbelieving this, they continued to attack the condition, resulting in a depletion of original qi, leading to virtual heat rising, causing gum erosion and submandibular nodules. I used a large dose of herbs like Dahuang and others, and the child soon recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had a loss of appetite accompanied by fever, took herbs such as Qiong and Lian, but their food intake decreased daily, leading to abdominal distension and emaciation. I noted that the spleen was weak and food was stagnating, resulting in further damage to the original qi. I first used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding a few doses of Muscone and other ingredients, which gradually improved the condition. I then used Liujun Decoction and fried ginger for regulation and stabilization.</p>
<p>A child who loved to eat meat experienced abdominal pain with irregular bowel movements. After half a year, their abdomen swelled, and a hard lump formed in the right side, occasionally shifting. Three months later, another lump formed in the left side, and there was abdominal distension, with sore gums and thirst. Their urine was either reddish and thin or clear, and their stool color was inconsistent and foul. After another half year, three to five nodules appeared under the jaw. They took medicines to dissolve lumps and eliminate stagnation, depleting their original qi further and worsened the lumps. I used the Si Wei Fei Er Wan and Wu Wei Yi Gong San, adjusting treatment according to the symptoms, which gradually alleviated the thirst and heat. After about a month, the abdominal distension began to decrease, and I added Jiu Wei Lu Hui Wan, leading to gradual healing of the gums. Finally, I used Si Jun Zi Tang as the main prescription, supplemented with Wutou Wan among other herbs, resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>A young child has irregular eating habits, sometimes experiencing diarrhea, abdominal pain, or bloating, with a hard lump in the abdomen and irregular bowel movements. The child feels thirsty with a fever, and has swollen gums and bad breath. The treatment of using digestive aids only exacerbates the prior symptoms, leading to further weight loss. I remarked: the complexion is yellow with a hint of green, indicating depletion of the spleen and insult from the liver. The method should be to harmonize and replenish the central qi while calming the liver to strengthen the spleen’s qi, thus naturally relieving the fire of deficiency and allowing all symptoms to heal. Consequently, herbal formulas such as the Monthly Harmonizing Decoction and Large Artemisia Decoction were administered, and the child was indeed cured.</p>
<p>Another young child presented with lower abdominal distension and difficulty urinating, especially worse in the morning. A decoction to replenish the central qi and boost energy was prescribed, adding costus as well as a morning formula, while a modified version of Five-Flavored Decoction with added Cimicifuga and Bupleurum was given at night. After over two months, the child recovered. However, after a loss of dietary regulation, the child experienced abdominal bloating and sour belching, for which Five-Flavored Decoction and Four-Ingredient Euonymus Pill were used, leading to a cure. Later, after a marriage, the child fell ill again with similar symptoms, compounded by severe cold, abdominal chill, clear frequent urination, and unsettled stools, with cold hands and feet. The treatment involved the Replenishing Central Qi Decoction and Eight-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, which soon brought recovery.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>A young child experienced abdominal distension from overeating, with a feeling of fullness in the chest and phlegm present. I administered Yigong San, and he recovered. Later, after overeating again, he suffered abdominal distension with pain. Even with medication taken to purge, although the pain ceased, the distension worsened and he experienced further wheezing. This indicated damage to the spleen&#39;s energy affecting the lungs, so I used Liu Jun, with Jie Geng for nourishment, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child had abdominal distension, aversion to food, cold and heat sensations, and nausea, resembling an exterior wind attack. I noted that the pulse at the qi point was larger than at Renying, indicating stagnation of food and drink. I prescribed a dose of Baohe Wan, and all symptoms promptly receded. However, the abdominal distension persisted, so I treated with Yigong San, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child suffering from a cold had a cough with phlegm. I treated him with Liu Jun, Jie Geng, Sang Pi, and Xing Ren, leading to recovery. Subsequently, he experienced stagnation of food and had symptoms of diarrhea, distension, and pain. I added Shan Zha and Hou Po to Liu Jun, which provided relief. When he then experienced vomiting from food stoppage, taking medication for purging worsened his cough. I suggested that this indicated a deficiency in both the spleen and lungs and needed adjustment and nourishment. He thought it was a slow treatment, so he took diaphoretic and purgative medicines instead, which exacerbated the previous symptoms and led to increased shaking of the head. I then used Tianma San, significantly adding Diaoteng Hook and Yigong San, and he ultimately recovered.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>A child experiences abdominal swelling and pain, alternating between cold and heat, and cries when pressure is applied to the abdomen; this is due to food stagnation. First, administer a dose of Baohe Wan, and the symptoms will improve. If there is increased thirst and pressing on the abdomen does not cause crying, this indicates that the food has been eliminated but the spleen&#39;s qi has not yet recovered. Treat with Wuwei Yigong San, adding Chaihu, and the child will improve.</p>
<p>Another child has food stagnation and takes medication to dissolve it. Once the food has been digested, the heat has not yet subsided, indicating deficiency heat in the stomach channel. Use Liujunzi Tang with added Chaihu and Shengma for four doses to alleviate the condition.</p>
<p>A child who initially had food stagnation took medication to counteract it, but experienced increased abdominal pain; pressing stops the pain. The remaining treatment is with Liujunzi Decoction to achieve recovery. Later, there is renewed food injury; administer Baohe Wan along with Sanleng and Binglang. If there is increased heaviness in the abdomen with favorable belching, this points to deficient spleen qi leading to descent. Continue treating with the previous decoction, adding Shengma and Chaihu for recovery.</p>
<p>A child has a pale complexion, difficulty digesting food, and frequent diarrhea. Using medications for dissolving accumulation and transforming phlegm does not yield results over time. I suggest it is due to spleen and stomach weakness; use Liujunzi Tang to gradually improve. Some believe it to be food accumulation needing expulsion, which leads to diarrhea, phlegm, and spasms. I say the spleen qi is further harmed, unable to nourish the lungs, and the deficiency in the lungs cannot pacify the liver, causing these symptoms. First, use Liujunzi with added Diaoteng Gou, and restrict food intake; further use Wuwei Yigong San with added Shengma will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>A young child suffered from abdominal pain due to heat accumulation, took a purgative, but continued to have a fever and undigested stools. Upon examination, there was no pain when pressing the abdomen, and the child refused cold water. This indicated that the food stagnation had resolved, but the spleen&#39;s energy was weak. A combination of the Five-Flavor Formula was prescribed with added Angelica and Cimicifuga, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child had abdominal distension and took areca nut, dragon&#39;s blood, bitter orange, and coptis, which aggravated the distension. I said: This is due to deficiency in the spleen and blood stagnation; it should not be attacked directly. The Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Angelica was prescribed. After several doses, the stomach energy gradually recovered, and symptoms improved. In the morning, the Five-Flavor Formula with added Cimicifuga and Bupleurum was used, with the same formula plus Angelica and Peony in the evening, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A different young child had a persistent abdominal blockage, became emaciated, and developed a growing abdomen, experienced chills and fever, was lethargic, and craved water. The main treatment was a formula based on Atractylodes, supplemented with Four-Flavor Fat Child Pills. After a month, various symptoms gradually improved.</p>
<p>Lastly, one child had abdominal blockage, felt hot like fire, exhibited various symptoms too extensive to detail, was treated with the Five-Flavor Formula in the morning and Four-Flavor Fat Child Pills in the evening. After a month, symptoms slightly improved; with the addition of Rehmannia Pills, the child could possibly walk. Consequently, Rehmannia Pills were used in the morning, and the Five-Flavor Formula along with Shrimp (or insect herb) Pills in the evening. After several doses, the child was cured.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　小儿直诀 【宋　钱乙】</p>
<p>　　　　　癖</p>
<p>　　若腹中有癖不食，但饮乳是也，当渐用白饼子下之。盖小儿病此，良由乳食不消，伏于腹中，乍冷乍热，饮水过多，即荡涤肠胃，亡失津液，脾胃虚弱，不能传化水谷，以致四肢羸瘦，肚腹渐大而成疳矣。　　【注　按前证或因小儿乳食过多，致伤脾胃，或乳食起居，七情六淫失宜所致，必先调补元气为主，佐以消散之剂。若除之不以渐，则必有颠复之患。常治食积既去而热不退，或作呕吐少食，用五味异功散。胁胀少食，善怒泻青，用六君子汤加升麻、柴胡。少食体倦泻黄，用补中益气汤；手足冷加炮姜、木香；如不应，佐用四神丸。体瘦潮热口干，大便不调，用肥儿丸。若兼颈项结核，口齿腐烂，当参前疳条主之。】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　　　儒门事亲 【元　张从政】</p>
<p>　　　　　小儿肌热</p>
<p>　　小儿身瘦肌热，面黄腹大，或吐泻，腹有青筋，两胁结硬如碗之状，名乳痈癖，俗呼曰奶癖是也。乳痈得之绵帛太厚，乳食伤多，太热则病生于肌，太饱则必伤于肠胃。生于肌表者，赤眼丹瘤，疥癣痈疖，眉炼赤白，口疮牙疳宣烂，及寒热往来，此乳母抱不下怀，积热熏蒸之故，两手脉浮而数也。伤于肠胃者，吐泻惊疳，哽气腹胀，肌瘦面黄，肚大筋青，喜食泥土，揉鼻窍头发作穗，乳瓣不化，此皆太饱之致然也。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>久而不愈，则成乳痈，两手脉沉而紧，此其辨也。已上诸证，皆乳母怀抱奉养过度之罪。癖之疾，可以丁香化癖散；取过数服，牛黄通膈丸、甘露散、益黄散等药磨之。如不愈者，有揉癖一法。　　呪曰：日精月华，助吾手法，勑斩减消，驱毒勑摄！　　右用法之人，每念一遍，望日取气一口，吹在手心自揉之。如小儿病在左胁上，用法之人亦左手揉之；在右胁上，以右手揉之。亦吹在乳癖上，令母揉之。男孩儿用单日，女孩儿用双日。大忌风雨阴晦孝子见之。用法之时，宜于日中前，晴明好日色则可矣。<br>　　　　平治会萃 【元　朱震亨】</p>
<p>　　　　　食积</p>
<p>　　小儿食积痰热伤乳为病，大概肝与脾病多，肝只是有余，脾只是不足。<br>　　　　婴童百问 【明　鲁伯嗣】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　腹中有癖</p>
<p>　　癖者，血膜包水侧僻于胁旁，时时作痛也。惟癖为能发潮，为能生寒热，故疟家多蓄黄水，日久而复结癖于中脘，寒热不已，有是疾者以此。小儿脏腑和平，荣卫调畅，则津液自然流通，纵使多饮水浆，不能为病。惟乳哺失调，三焦关格，以致水饮停滞，肠胃不能宣通，如冷气搏之，则结聚而成癖，轻者用积滞木香丸，重者用取癖丸。仲阳云：腹中有癖，不食但饮乳是也，当渐用白饼子下之。如不早治，则不能食，脾胃虚弱，四肢不举，诸邪遂生，羸瘦而成疳矣。<br>　　　　　痞结</p>
<p>　　痞者，塞也。结者，实也。热气蕴于胸膈之间，留饮聚于腹胁之内，于是荣卫不能流行，脏腑不能宣通，由胀满而致痞结，势使然耳，此实热之证也。时或发为壮热，圣惠甘遂散主之。此药治小儿痞结，虽服汤药时，暂得利而滞实不去，心下坚胀，按之即啼，内有伏热诸候，并成此疾，宜疏利大便，破结散气，后宜常服进食丸。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　积痛</p>
<p>　　仲阳云：积痛口中气温，面色黄白，目无精光，或白睛多，及多睡畏食，或大便酸臭者，当磨积而痛自除，宜消积丸，甚者白饼子下之。后胃气不和，用白朮散、小沉香丸、感应丸治之。又有食积肚痛有热者，芍药甘草汤加干葛。吐者，加半夏、生姜，或加枳实亦效。<br>　　　　　积滞</p>
<p>　　小儿有积滞，面目黄肿，肚热胀痛复睡多困，酷啼不食，或大肠闭濇，小便如油，或便利无禁，粪白酸臭，此皆积滞也。然有乳积食积，须当明辨之。吐乳泻乳，其气酸臭，此由啼叫未已，便用乳儿，停滞不化而得之，是为乳积。肚硬带热，渴泻或呕，此由饮食无度，多餐过饱，饱后即睡得之，是为食积。腹痛啼叫，利如蟹渤，此由触忤其气，荣卫不和，淹延日久得之，是为气积。合用木香丸主之，槟榔丸亦可用。大小便闭者神芎丸妙。甚是斋推气亦佳。冷证下积，五珍丸亦可用。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　食积冷热</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：夫宿食不消者，脾胃冷故也。小儿乳哺饮食，取冷过度，冷气积于脾胃，胃为水谷之海，脾气磨而消之，胃气调和则乳哺消化，脾伤于冷则宿食不消。脉沉者，伤食不化故也。亦有伤乳伤食而身热者，惟肚腹之热尤甚。人之伤积肚热，粪极臭酸，而夜间有热，伤积之明验，人所未晓也。冷者消食丸、木香丸。夜间有热，天明复凉，乃是伤寒夹食失解故也，当服白饼子，先与微利，次与参苏饮；发热，地骨皮饮、秦艽散退热而安。有实热者，大柴胡汤去大黄亦可服。《伤寒论》：人病有宿食，何以别之？师曰：寸口脉浮而大，按之反濇，故知有宿食，当下之，宜大承气汤。其喘而发热者，紫霜丸主之。冷证用进食丸尤佳。亦治食厥，乃四肢逆冷面色青黑是也，或当吐而苏。有痰者温胆汤加减服，痰定而呕自痊。冷证丁香丸可服，白饼子下痰亦可。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　　胃气不和虚冷</p>
<p>　　仲阳云：胃气不和，面光白无精光，口中气冷，不思食，吐水，肌瘦虚弱，腹痛，当补脾，益黄散主之。凡人以胃气为本，惟治病亦然。胃气有实有虚，实者则有痞满内热之证，虚则有呕吐不食之证。虚者益之，实者损之，欲得其平则可矣。平胃散、观音散、银白散壮胃之剂，不可缺也。<br>　　　　伤寒六书 【明　陶华】</p>
<p>　　　　　伤食</p>
<p>　　海藏云：伤食宜以药下之者，当详其所伤何物，生硬寒热不等，不可遽用巴豆之类大毒之药下之。升麻葛根汤，太阳阳明也。惺惺散，风热，咽不利，脾不和，少阳渴，小便不利也。小柴胡汤，往来寒热，胸胁微痛，少阳也。然欲知其经，当以脉别之。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　保婴撮要 【明　薛铠】</p>
<p>　　　　　不乳食</p>
<p>　　经曰：胃为水谷之海，六腑之大源也。人身气血腑脏，俱由胃气而生，故东垣之法，一以脾胃为主，所谓补肾不若补脾，正此意也。在小儿虽得乳食，水谷之气未全，尤仗胃气，胃气一虚，则四脏俱失所养矣。故丹溪谓小儿多肝脾之疾也。若面色晃白，目无精光，口中气冷，不食吐水，肌瘦腹疼，此胃气虚寒之证，用五味异功散或六君子汤主之。若大便不实，兼脾虚也，加干姜温之。中满不利，脾不运也，加木香开之。喜冷便秘，胃实热也，用泻黄散凉之。命门火衰，不能生土者，用八味丸补之。禀赋胃气不足，亦用此丸。盖下焦真阳充盛，则上生脾元，自能温蒸水谷矣。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　　　古今医鉴 【明　龚信】</p>
<p>　　　　　癖疾论</p>
<p>　　天地气运，固有南北之殊；小儿病患，亦有彼此之异。北方小儿患癖疾者，十恒八九；南方小儿患癖疾者，百无二三。是何谓而致之？盖南方水土薄弱，饮食柔软，易于克化，厥疾少矣。北方水土厚实，面食坚硬，难于运动，厥疾生焉，亦由脾胃之不和也。故东垣以脾胃为人之主，脾胃和一疾不生，亏则百病生焉。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>小儿脾胃本自柔脆，脏腑尚且娇嫩，为之母者，多不知调护之法，惟务姑息之爱，不问咸酸甘肥之味，瓜果生冷之物，及糍粽湿面油腻煎炙之类，诸般稠粘干硬难化之物，顺其所欲，食之过多，损伤脾胃，脾胃既伤，则不能消化水谷，水谷不化则停滞而发热，发热既久则耗伤元气，元气虚则不能运动其血，血遂不行而停滞不散，留于胁肋之间，遂成血块，居于皮里膜外，不能动移，始则有如钱大，发热则日渐长，其形如龟、如蛇、如猪肝肺者，长短大小之不一也。内有血孔贯通，外有血筋盘固，其筋直通背脊之下，与脐相对之间，有动脉之外，乃癖疾之根。夫人身之血脉，则昼夜循环无端，一周流及，此其血则贯入筋内，由筋入孔，由孔入癖。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>盖癖得血养而渐长，邪得血助而渐盛，于是正气愈惫而血愈枯矣。发为潮热，以致诸疾，或头出虚汗，或胸前项下跳动，或肚大青筋，毛焦发竖，或面黄肌瘦，四肢干枯。淹延日久，则毒气发出，变生诸证。有变为牙疳口臭，宣露出血者；有变为头面肿大，口鼻溃烂者；有变为一切疮毒流脓出血者，有变为肢体浮肿，腹胀气喘者；有变为寒热往来，似疟非疟者；有变为痰嗽喘热，衄吐下血者，有变为呕吐泻痢，脱肛下坠者；有变为心腹疼痛，疝气偏坠者，皆癖毒攻出之所致也。<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>变证多端，难以悉举，乃九死一生之病，非一方一法所能愈也。　　治之先宜针灸之法以断其根，使血不贯入筋内，则癖无血所养，癖即自败矣。外以膏药贴之，内以汤丸攻之。大抵宜补脾养气以治其本，清热消块以治其标，标本兼济。又当执其权衡，以量儿之壮弱，病之轻重。若壮而轻者，则治标之药多于治本之剂；若弱而重者，则治本之剂多于治标之药。大概肥儿丸、乌金丸、阿魏丸、千金保童丸之类，乃半攻半补平和之剂，宜对证选用，于针灸之后，可收十全之功也。医斯疾者，宜详究之！<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　　　古今医统 【明　徐春甫】</p>
<p>　　　　　积滞</p>
<p>　　《活幼心书》云：小儿所患之证，皆因乳哺不节，过食生冷坚硬之物，脾胃不能克化，停积中脘；外为风寒所伤，或因夜卧失盖，致头疼面黄，身热，眼泡微肿，腹痛膨胀，足冷肚热，喜睡神昏，不思饮食。或呕哕噫气，吞酸，大便腥臭，此为陈积所伤；但有时时泄下清水如生草汁，是受惊而后有积，烦闷啾唧，常似生嗔，名为惊积。小儿医者，亦惟因其轻重虚实而治之可也。<br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Comprehensive Illustrated Collection of Books from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 441</strong><br><strong>Children&#39;s Eating Disorders</strong><br><strong>Direct Methods for Treating Children</strong> 【Song Dynasty, Qian Yi】</p>
<p><strong>Eating Disorders</strong></p>
<p>If there are disorders in the abdomen resulting in refusal to eat but only drinking milk, gradually use white cakes to alleviate it. This condition in children arises from undigested milk and food stagnating in the abdomen, becoming alternatingly cold and hot. Excessive drinking of water may wash away the essential fluids in the intestines and stomach, leading to weakness of the spleen and stomach, which cannot transform and transport food and fluids, resulting in emaciation of the limbs and a gradually enlarging abdomen, ultimately leading to malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is noted that this may be due to excessive intake of milk and food causing harm to the spleen and stomach, or inappropriate lifestyle factors from emotional disturbances. It is essential to first nourish the vital energy as the primary method, supplemented with dispersing agents. If the disorder is not gradually treated, relapses are likely. Common treatments for food accumulation when heat persists include methods for vomiting with reduced appetite, using a mixture of various flavors. For side bloating and reduced appetite, with irritability and diarrhea, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additional ingredients like angelica and bupleurum. For reduced appetite, fatigue, and yellow diarrhea, use the Tonic for Strengthening the Center and Benefiting Qi; for cold hands and feet, add roasted ginger and cardamom; if there are no improvements, use the Four Spirits Pill. If there is emaciation with tidal fever and dry mouth, accompanied by irregular bowel movements, use the Fat Child Pill. If concurrent issues include swollen neck glands and decayed teeth, refer to the preceding guidelines for malnutrition.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<h4>Young Child with Fever</h4>
<p>A young child with a thin body and fever, yellowish face, and a large abdomen may experience vomiting and diarrhea. There are blue veins on the abdomen, and the sides are hard as if in the shape of a bowl. This condition is known as &quot;breast carbuncle&quot; or commonly referred to as &quot;milk blemish.&quot; The breast carbuncle arises from overly thick cotton or silk, excessive consumption of milk, and if there is too much heat, illness develops in the muscles; if too full, it inevitably harms the gastrointestinal system. </p>
<p>Symptoms appearing on the skin include red eyes, reddish lumps, skin conditions, sores in the mouth, and dental problems. Additionally, there can be alternating chills and fever. This is due to the milk nurse holding the child too tightly, causing internal heat to accumulate. The pulse in both hands feels floating and rapid.</p>
<p>When the gastrointestinal tract is harmed, symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, distress, distended abdomen, thin body, yellowish complexion, a large belly with visible green veins, a preference for eating dirt, a habit of rubbing the nose and hair into clumps, and undigested milk, all resulting from overeating.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If not healed for a long time, it will turn into a breast abscess. The pulse is deep and tight in both hands, which is the distinction. All the aforementioned symptoms are due to the excessive indulgence of nursing mothers. For the ailment of accumulation, one can use a formula made from cloves; take it several times, along with medications like beef bile for clearing the phlegm, sweet dew powder, and beneficial yellow powder, ground together. If it does not improve, there is a method of massaging. The incantation is: &quot;Sun essence and moonlight, assist my technique; command, sever, reduce, and dispel the poison!&quot; </p>
<p>For those using this method, each time they recite it, they should take a breath of energy from the sun and blow into their palms to massage. If the child&#39;s ailment is on the left side, the user should massage with the left hand; if on the right, with the right hand. They should also blow on the breast lump for the mother to massage. Boys should be treated on odd days, and girls on even days. It is a grave taboo for a filial child to witness this during wind, rain, or dreary days. The method should ideally be performed before noon on clear and sunny days.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulation of Food</strong></p>
<p>Infantile accumulation of food, phlegm, and heat harming nursing indicates primarily problems with the liver and spleen. The liver is merely excessive, while the spleen is insufficient.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Abdominal Mass</strong></p>
<p>An abdominal mass refers to a blood membrane encapsulating water, located near the sides, causing intermittent pain. This mass can trigger tidal waves of discomfort and produce intermittent cold and heat symptoms, which is why those with malaria often accumulate yellow fluid over time, leading to a recurrence of the mass in the middle abdomen. Such individuals suffer from continuous cold and heat symptoms. If children have balanced organs and their health is regulated, bodily fluids will circulate naturally, and even if they drink a lot of water, they will not feel ill. However, when nursing is not well regulated, and the three burners are obstructed, fluid will stagnate. If cold air interacts with it, a mass will form. For mild cases, a wooden herb pill for accumulation should be used; for severe cases, a pill to dissolve the mass is necessary. Zhong Yang stated: when there is an abdominal mass, one should avoid food and only drink milk gradually, and begin taking white dumplings to flush it out. If not treated early, inability to eat can lead to a weak spleen and stomach, leading to weakness in the limbs, and the emergence of various ailments, resulting in emaciation and wasting.</p>
<p><strong>Chest Oppression and Distension</strong></p>
<p>Oppression indicates blockage. Distension signifies fullness. When heat accumulates between the chest and diaphragm, and fluid gathers in the abdomen and sides, the flow of vital energy becomes obstructed, and the organs can’t function properly. This leads to a distended fullness and subsequently causes oppression, which is a clear sign of actual heat. At times, this can result in intense heat. Sheng Hui&#39;s Gan Sui powder is the remedy for this. This medicine treats the oppression in children, and even when taking decoctions, the stagnation may not relieve, leaving a firm and bloated feeling in the chest that causes crying when pressed. Internal hidden heat accumulates, leading to this ailment. It’s essential to promote bowel movements, break the mass, and disperse the energy. Subsequently, regular consumption of pills for digestion should be encouraged.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Accumulated Pain</h3>
<p>Zhongyang said: Accumulated pain is characterized by warm breath in the mouth, pale yellow complexion, lack of brightness in the eyes, possibly excessive dryness in the white of the eyes, excessive sleepiness with aversion to food, or smelly, sour stools. In such cases, the accumulation should be ground away and the pain will subside. It is advisable to use &quot;Xiao Ji Wan&quot; (a herbal pill for resolving accumulation); in severe cases, &quot;Bai Bing Zi&quot; (white cakes) should be administered. If the stomach qi is not harmonious afterward, &quot;Bai Zhu San&quot; (Atractylodes powder), &quot;Xiao Chen Xiang Wan&quot; (small cardamom pill), and &quot;Gan Ying Wan&quot; (pills for harmonious response) can be used. In cases of food accumulation leading to abdominal pain with heat signs, &quot;Shao Yao Gan Cao Tang&quot; (Peony and Licorice Decoction) should be taken, adding &quot;Ban Xia&quot; (Pinellia), &quot;Sheng Jiang&quot; (fresh ginger), or even &quot;Zhi Shi&quot; (bitter orange) for effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Accumulated Stagnation</h3>
<p>For infants with accumulation and stagnation, characterized by a yellow and swollen face, heat and swelling in the abdomen, increased sleepiness, excessive crying, refusal to eat, or constipation with oily urine, or loose stools being white and foul-smelling, this is all due to stagnation. However, distinguish clearly between milk accumulation and food accumulation. If there is vomiting or diarrhea of milk with a sour smell, this is due to the infant’s previous cries and feeding, resulting in a stagnation that fails to transform; this is termed milk accumulation. A hard belly with heat, thirst, diarrhea, or vomiting results from indulgent eating habits, excessive meals, and sleeping immediately afterward; this is known as food accumulation. Abdominal pain with crying, and diarrhea that is like gravel indicates a disturbance of qi leading to disharmony of the protective and nourishing aspects, which develops over time; this is classified as qi accumulation. The remedy should include &quot;Mu Xiang Wan&quot; (wood aromatic pills) or &quot;Ping Lang Wan&quot; (betel nut pills). For constipation, &quot;Shen Qiong Wan&quot; is effective. The same applies to conditions with cold-induced accumulation; &quot;Wu Zhen Wan&quot; (Five Treasures Pills) may also be utilized.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Food Accumulation and Cold</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi said: The inability to digest food is due to the coldness of the spleen and stomach. Infants, when fed, often intake excessive coldness, leading to cold energy accumulating in the spleen and stomach. The stomach is the sea for water and grains; when the spleen&#39;s energy is hindered, digestion is impaired. If the stomach&#39;s energy is harmonious, then milk and food can be digested, but cold damages the spleen, resulting in undigested food. A deep pulse indicates that the food is not transforming. There are also cases where the body heats up due to the harm from milk and food; the heat in the abdomen is particularly severe, causing extremely foul and sour stools, especially pronounced at night—a manifestation of accumulation that many do not understand.</p>
<p>For cold conditions, one can use digestion pills or lignum aloes pills. If there is heat at night and it cools down by morning, this is due to a combination of cold damage and food stagnation; one should take white pancakes, starting with a small quantity, followed by ginseng and perilla drink. For fevers, one can use earth bone skin decoction or Qin Jiao powder to reduce heat and calm the body. In cases of excess heat, Da Chai Hu decoction, minus the rhubarb, can also be used. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot;: When a person is ill with undigested food, how can it be distinguished? The teacher said: The pulse at the wrist is floating and large; when pressed, it feels hollow, indicating the presence of undigested food, which should be purged using Da Chengqi decoction. For wheezing and fever, Zi Shuang pills are the main treatment. For cold conditions, digestion pills are especially effective. This also treats food stagnation, where the limbs feel cold and the complexion appears bluish-black; it may require vomiting to recover. For those with phlegm, Wen Dan decoction can be modified and taken; once the phlegm is settled, spontaneous vomiting leads to recovery. For cold conditions, clove pills may be taken; white pancakes are also effective at relieving phlegm.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>Zhong Yang said: When the stomach qi is imbalanced, the face appears pale and lacks vitality, there is a cold sensation in the mouth, no appetite, possible vomiting of water, weakness and thinness of the body, and abdominal pain. One should tonify the spleen and use Yihuang San to remedy this. For everyone, the stomach qi is fundamental; treating diseases is the same. Stomach qi can be either deficient or excessive; in excess, there can be symptoms of distention and internal heat, while deficiency can present as vomiting and lack of appetite. Treat deficiencies with tonics, and excesses with reductions; to achieve balance is the goal. Ping Wei San, Guanyin San, and Yinbai San are important formulas for strengthening the stomach and should not be neglected.</p>

Xing Xing San is for wind-heat conditions, with difficulties in the throat, disharmony in the spleen, dryness, and difficulty in urination, correlating to the shaoyang. Xiao Chai Hu Tang should be used when there are alternating chills and fever, slight pain in the chest and flanks, indicating the shaoyang phase.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials for Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Xue Kai)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Not Feeding</strong>  </p>
<p>The classics say: The stomach is the sea of water and grains, and the major source of the six bowels. The energy, blood, and organs of the human body all arise from the energy of the stomach, hence the methods of Dongyuan emphasize the spleen and stomach as paramount. This is to say that nourishing the kidneys is not as effective as nourishing the spleen, reflecting this principle. In infants, even if they receive milk and food, the energy from water and grains is not fully complete; they rely primarily on the stomach&#39;s energy. If the stomach&#39;s energy is deficient, then all four organs will lack nourishment. Therefore, Danxi asserts that children often suffer from diseases of the liver and spleen. Symptoms include pale complexion, lack of luster in the eyes, cool breath in the mouth, refusal to eat and vomiting water, emaciation, and abdominal pain; these indicate deficiency and coldness of the stomach&#39;s energy. The treatment is to use Wuwei Yigong San or Liu Junzi Decoction. If the stool is not firm and there is also spleen deficiency, add dried ginger for warmth. If there is fullness and discomfort in the middle, indicating poor spleen function, add costus to disperse it. If the infant prefers cold and has constipation, this indicates excess heat in the stomach; use Xie Huang San to cool it down. If the fire of the life gate is weak and unable to nourish the earth, use Bawei Wan to supplement it. For congenital deficiency of stomach energy, this pill is also used. It is vital that when the true yang of the lower body is abundant, it naturally generates the spleen&#39;s essence above, thus effectively warming and steaming the water and grains.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Habitual Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The movement of the energies of heaven and earth has notable distinctions between the north and south; likewise, the illnesses of children vary in these regions. In the north, it is common for children to suffer from habitual illnesses, with a rate of about eighty to ninety percent; whereas in the south, the occurrence is only a few percent at most. What causes this difference? It is mainly because the water and soil in the south are weak, and the diet is soft and easy to digest, resulting in fewer illnesses. In contrast, the water and soil in the north are rich and solid, and the staple food is hard, making digestion more difficult, which leads to the emergence of such illnesses, often due to disharmony of the spleen and stomach. Therefore, Dongyuan emphasized that the spleen and stomach are crucial to a person&#39;s health; when they are harmonious, no illness arises, but if they are deficient, a multitude of diseases can manifest.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Children&#39;s spleen and stomach are naturally delicate; their organs are still tender. Many mothers are unaware of the methods to care for them, focusing only on indulgent love without considering the flavors of salty, sour, sweet, or fatty foods. They disregard cold fruits and vegetables, sticky rice balls, and greasy fried foods, allowing children to satisfy their desires and eat excessively, which harms the spleen and stomach. Once the spleen and stomach are damaged, they cannot digest grains and water; undigested food then stagnates and causes fever. If the fever persists too long, it drains the vital energy. When vital energy is deficient, it cannot circulate the blood, leading to blood stagnation and accumulation, which may manifest as clots lodged between the ribs. These can grow larger with time, assuming shapes like coins, turtles, snakes, or even organs like liver or lungs, varying in length and size. Internally, there are blood vessels connected, and externally, the blood tends to coil. These vessels lead directly to the lower back, opposite the navel, coexisting with an artery, which is the root of the ailment. The blood circulation in a person&#39;s body is continuous, flowing day and night. Blood circulates through the muscles, entering through pores and leading to stagnation.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p>The spleen governs stagnation; when it is functional, there is stagnation with heat and thirst, while when it is deficient, it leads to vomiting and diarrhea, giving rise to wind. Spleen disease presents as stagnation, drowsiness, and diarrhea, with a lack of appetite.</p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, the face appears pale, the eyes lack vitality, the breath from the mouth and nose is cold, the body is thin and weak, there is water regurgitation and abdominal pain, and there is disinterest in dairy and food. Use Yi Huang San to nourish the spleen, and after that, use Tiao Zhong Wan for regulation. </p>
<p>In cases where there is a cold sensation in the hands and feet due to wind, it indicates spleen deficiency. First, use Yi Huang San to replenish the spleen, and then use Dai Qing Gao to disperse the wind. </p>
<p>Spleen diseases manifest in all four seasons and should be treated similarly to other organs. A right condition is easy to treat, while a wrong one is difficult to treat. Spleen deficiency manifests with a red face and yellowish eyes. The five organs interact oppositely, thus treatment should be according to the symptoms.</p>
<p>The spleen governs dampness, leading to excessive diarrhea and drowsiness, and a heavy body feeling. When the spleen suffers from damp, bitter foods should be consumed to dry it out. </p>
<p>If there is excessive diarrhea with red and yellow, sleep with eyes closed, use Xie Huang San. If there is deficiency, resulting in white diarrhea and sleep with eyes open, use Bai Zhu San. </p>
<p>If the liver invades the spleen, it may lead to wind, diarrhea, and vomiting; use Fu Ling Ban Xia Tang for treatment. When the heart invades the spleen, it presents as deficiency causing heat and heavy body resulting in diarrhea; use Qiang Huo Huang Qin Cang Zhu Gan Cao Tang. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Weak Spleen Leads to Fatigue</p>
<p>The spleen possesses the tranquil virtue of the Earth, yet operates with the vigorous energy of the Heaven. The stomach, being yang, governs qi; the spleen, being yin, governs blood. The stomach absorbs and receives, while the spleen facilitates transformation and transportation. One absorbs and one transforms, generating essence and qi, with the clear energy rising and the turbid matter descending. It absorbs the five grains and transforms them into fluids; the clear essence nourishes, while the turbid matter protects. When yin and yang are thus balanced, it is referred to as the key. Therefore, in Dongyuan&#39;s view, the spleen and stomach are the foundation of the five organs. When the spleen qi is weak, the commands of vigorous operation do not manifest, and the function of transformation and generation is hindered, leading to excessive sleeping and fatigue. One should warm and tonify the spleen; when the spleen qi is robust, the clear yang energy of the viscera rises, facilitating movement, thereby eliminating fatigue. The Haizang method uses the Four Gentlemen Decoction, adding patchouli, cardamom, and pinellia, with doubled white atractylodes, and decocted with ginger and jujube, which is indeed a good method. If the spleen is deficient and sleep is excessive with many dreams, it indicates deficiency of heart blood and excess fire.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>宿食 (Accumulated Food)</strong></p>
<p>In cases of fever from cold damage, the heat from ingested food is particularly severe in the abdomen, accompanied by extremely sour and foul-smelling feces, and a humid heat at night, which notably indicates the harm from retained accumulation. For infants with undigested food, their stomach receives water and grains, but their spleen lacks the strength to process it due to their young age and inability to moderate intake, resulting in stagnation. Substances like Shenqu (a fermentation starter) and malt are known to harm the generation of vital energy in the stomach, let alone advancing to more potent substances like Sanleng (Rhizoma Sparganii) and Ezhum (Curcuma), or even stronger ones like Qianniuzi (Vigna unguiculata), Dahuang (Rhubarb), and Baduzi (Semen Crotonis). When the spleen&#39;s energy is first harmed by food, followed by more damage from medicine, and the energy has already escaped through purgation, how much is left to sustain? Therefore, medicines intended to expel food should not be used excessively; especially, those meant to purge accumulated substances must be carefully considered regarding whether the condition truly necessitates purging or not before use. According to Qian (Qian&#39;s) discussion on undigested food, it is due to cold in the spleen and stomach preventing digestion, thus support for the spleen and the primary benefits of Yi Huang San (a remedy) should be emphasized.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Accumulation of Cold and Heat from Food</h3>
<p>When a child has food accumulation, it is due to the spleen and stomach being deficient and cold, causing milk and food to not be digested, resulting in accumulation over time. The symptoms manifest as fever at night and coolness by morning, accompanied by abdominal pain and distension. There may be vomiting with sour belching, cold feet with a hot belly, a preference for sleep, and lethargy, with foul-smelling stools. If there are prior symptoms along with cold and heat, it is termed food accumulation with cold and heat. If the food is located above the stomach, it should be vomited; if it is below the stomach, it should be expelled. Abdominal pain and distension that worsen upon pressing should be purged. If the pain persists after purging, but stops upon pressing, it requires tonification. </p>
<p>If there is a combination of food injury and cold, it should first be resolved with Ginseng and Perilla Decoction. If there is severe heat leading to constipation, it should first be resolved with Major Bupleurum Decoction. If there is no external invasion, but only food injury that is not severe, it can be treated with Baohe Pills. The spleen is the organ of absolute yin, thus conditions affecting the spleen show heat at night; if heat is accompanied by cold, it indicates a situation where the stronger defeats the weaker. If undigested food is resolved, the cold and heat will cease; if the food is already digested and then tonified, the cold and heat will heal. </p>
<p>If both hands and feet are cold and there is a desire for warm food and drink, this indicates cold in the central region and requires warming. If there is an urge to defecate but nothing comes out, it suggests spleen qi deficiency that needs to be uplifted. If diarrhea occurs at night or in the early morning, both the spleen and kidneys are deficient and can be treated with Four Divine Pills. When hands and feet are hot and there is thirst for water, it indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, treated with Xie Huang San. For constipation, use Major Bupleurum Decoction. When hands and feet are hot, but there is no thirst and the stools are not hard, use Bai Zhu San. Additionally, treat abdominal pain and distension, and the accumulation of pain and stagnation.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Accumulated Illness Can Be Treated: Nine Cases</p>
<p>Facial swelling indicates accumulation. Accumulation relates to the spleen. The spleen governs the flesh of the body, so it reflects on the face, indicating it is a spleen-related accumulation. The spleen corresponds to the earth; earth has no fixed form, which is why swelling varies at different times of the day. If swelling appears mainly in the morning, it suggests that during sleep the spleen is not functioning well, leading to facial swelling. If this condition follows an illness, it indicates an accumulation of deficiency, which requires remedies to regulate the spleen, resolve the accumulation, and promote Qi.</p>
<p>When the face is flat against the ground while lying down, it suggests accumulation. Why is it flat against the ground? The accumulation is in the spleen and is of a cold nature. Why do we know this? The spleen thrives in earth, indicating it is spleen-related. The cold nature is associated with Yin, suggesting that cold, hard food has caused it, thus requiring warming remedies to resolve the accumulation and Qi.</p>
<p>Abdominal distension is an accumulation, and it is located in the lungs. How do we know this? The lungs govern Qi and should receive the accumulation; when Qi turns cold, abdominal distension arises along with fullness and urgent discomfort, indicating it resides in the lungs. Thus, addressing Qi regulation first is appropriate, followed by further Qi adjustments.</p>
<p>When urine resembles oil, it indicates accumulation situated in the small intestine. How do we know this? The accumulation involves the spleen, which should connect to the heart. If the heart is unimpeded, it flows into the small intestine, which is the organ of the heart; hence, it is known to be in the small intestine, resulting in turbid urine resembling rice washing or oily substances.</p>
<p>Yellowing of the skin indicates accumulation, which signifies accumulated Qi harming the heart.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart governs the blood vessels and influences the hair on the entire body. If it is affected by accumulated qi, the hair will turn yellow, indicating an injury to the heart. It is advisable to administer a cooling laxative and prescribed medicinal herbs. This individual is bound to have intermittent fevers.</p>
<p>Red and white dysentery results from accumulation in the lungs, caused by external factors affecting the intestines and possibly due to cold injuries. How do we know this? The lungs belong to the west, governed by the metal element (geng and xin), which appears white first, followed by red; this indicates external pathogens. Thus, we know the lungs transmit to the intestines, leading to red and white dysentery. It is appropriate to administer herbs for regulating qi afterward.</p>
<p>When both eyes are yellow and red with a blue tint, it indicates accumulation in the liver. How do we know this? The liver is associated with the east, governed by the wood element (jia and yi), which is blue, yet affected by accumulated qi that manifests as yellow and red. The blue tint in the eyes indicates they are connected to the five organs, with the liver being the main source. If there is accumulation affecting the spleen, it causes the eyes to appear blue, reflecting the liver&#39;s vitality. If it affects the gallbladder, the person may experience a bitter taste and should avoid food; it is advisable to use cooling herbs to alleviate this.</p>
<p>Generalized swelling throughout the body indicates accumulation, but not in the organs—only in the bowels. How do we know this? The swelling occurs when the accumulation was previously affected; upon administering medicine, it does not involve the organs, thus swelling manifests beneath the skin. It is best to use herbal laxatives to address the accumulation and then restore balance.</p>
<p>Frequent watery diarrhea with white stools indicates accumulation due to cold in the spleen. How do we know this? The spleen is responsible for transformation, and when affected by cold, it leads to accumulation in the spleen that results in cold, watery diarrhea producing white stools. Thus, we identify it in the spleen, and it is advisable to first warm the area and afterward use restorative herbs.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Accumulation</p>
<p>In children, accumulation arises from stagnation of visceral qi, gathering in one place and thus termed accumulation. The heart is the upper support, located above the navel, where it attacks the heart from above and the stomach from below; the spleen creates stagnation in the upper stomach; the liver generates fat qi to the left of the navel; the lungs cause breathing difficulties to the right of it; and the kidneys create disturbances below the navel. Each has its movements; these are not formed by food but by the accumulation of qi. The organs are related to yin, hence they remain in one place without movement. </p>
<p>Accumulation refers to the gathering of qi in the six bowels. The bowels are associated with the intestines, where the yang qi flows continuously, which is why its accumulation does not remain fixed, leading to abdominal pain. Signs of accumulation include a pale, thin, poor complexion, difficulty gaining muscle, swelling, and a tense abdomen, often due to water qi.</p>
<p>For accumulations within vacuity, any sudden fright leads to further accumulation, resulting in dark and foul feces. Accumulation in vacuity occurs due to overeating, which leads to both diarrhea and vomiting; hence the condition gradually worsens, and the illness remains unresolved, thus termed accumulation in vacuity. Moreover, if there is accumulation that shifts frequently but does not fully resolve, it leads to further latent conditions, being likewise termed accumulation within vacuity. If fright prompts a purge, the feces follow the fright and turn dark. Similarly, food accumulation forms feces into lumps. </p>
<p>In cases of malnutrition (dysentery), the vacuity causes accumulation, as the illness leads to diarrhea but does not resolve the malnutrition, resulting in pale-colored feces.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

Finally, use Yun Qi San to adjust and replenish.</p>
<p>In cases of stagnation, it&#39;s essential to distinguish between deficiency and excess. Moreover, children vary in constitution—thin or plump, short or tall, dark or light—across different regions and times, and thus cannot be treated uniformly. My approach is that those with substantial conditions may take the Jin Shi Wan, while those who are weak, pale, and emaciated should use the Fei Er Wan.</p>
<p>At the onset, when the vital energy is not yet depleted, if there is abdominal distension or pain and difficulty with urine and bowel movements, first administer Bai Bing Zi or Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the heat does not recede, and there are symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea with loss of appetite, it indicates a harm to the spleen and stomach, treated with Six Gentlemen Decoction. If the hands and feet are cold and there is a preference for hot soup, this indicates a deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, to which add roasted ginger and costus. If the complexion is pale yellow, with no brightness in the eyes, both the spleen and lungs are weak, and the treatment is Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. For abdominal pain with diarrhea or dysentery, or difficulty in urination, use Si Ni San. If there is fever with evening chills or ongoing diarrhea, it indicates a sinking of spleen qi; with thirst, unbalanced bowel movements, and a desire for a transformation of the disease, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, combined with Fei Er Wan. The classics state: where evil gathers, its qi must be deficient; if it lingers, the disease becomes tangible. Attention must be given to regulating the spleen as the primary measure, supported by dispersing and guiding methods. This aligns with the ancient saying about nourishing the righteous to eliminate what is unwanted.</p>
<p>As for milk accumulation:</p>
<p>The signs are simply vomiting and regurgitating milk with a foul smell, due to excessive crying; hastily feeding the infant leads to stagnation. Mr. Mao first used Clove Powder to regulate the stomach, then employed Niu Huang Pill to remove the milk accumulation, followed by Yun Qi San; regular use of Jian Pi San leads to recovery. </p>
<p>In cases of milk lumps, the signs are a bluish-yellow complexion, intense thirst and heat, frequent vomiting of milk, development of sores in the mouth while gradually becoming yellow and thin, and internal abdominal masses that do not disperse. This results from the wet nursing mother having irregular eating and drinking habits, excessive drunkenness or fullness, which impacts the infant; or if the nursing mother consistently lies in one position, preventing the infant from turning, and the child also falls asleep, leading to the milk stagnating, predominantly on the side, resulting in blockages that become painful.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Food Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The belly feels hard and hot compared to other areas, and may cause diarrhea or vomiting due to overeating and sleeping right after a meal. Mr. Mao uses Niu Huang Wan to eliminate the accumulation, then employs Yun Qi San for adjustment, and regularly takes Wan Ling Wan for recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms include a yellow-white complexion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, crying in distress, and diarrhea resembling crab paste. This is due to the disharmony of Ying and Wei, and the discord between the two energies, which develops over time. Mr. Mao uses Wan Ling Wan, Yun Qi San, Xing Pi San, and Jian Pi San, among others, for combined treatment. The &quot;Secret Records&quot; states: to treat children&#39;s Qi disorders, take San Leng San and make it into porridge with rice flour for the nursing mother to consume. For children under ten years old and infants less than a hundred days old, regardless of issues like convulsions or other ailments, this treatment is remarkably effective.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>The complexion appears yellowish like soil, or with a pallid and swollen appearance. There may be slight pain above the navel, a hot belly, reduced appetite, and pain in the navel and abdomen immediately after eating, with undigested food and slight feverishness in the head. This is due to having eaten hard or cold substances, injuring the spleen. To treat this, first use Qing Jin Wan to clear the accumulation in the spleen, then apply Yun Qi San and Xing Pi San for adjustment. Regularly taking Jian Pi San and Wan Ling Wan leads to recovery.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Shock Accumulation</h3>
<p>Sometimes clear water spills like raw rice juice, which occurs due to injury and leads to accumulation. It causes agitation and frequent annoyance, often arising from innate anger, referred to as shock accumulation. First, alleviate the shock, then address the accumulation. For shock, use Wuling Powder or Baijie Powder; for accumulation, use Sanleng Powder or Wuxi Pill, along with Sanjie Powder, brewed with fried Shenqu and ginger decoction. Xingspi Powder and Chenxiang Biling Pill can calm the shock and transform the accumulation, strengthening the energy and harmonizing the stomach. Additionally, avoid cold milk, and natural balance will follow.</p>
<h3>Virtual Accumulation</h3>
<p>Symptoms include slight heat throughout the body, lack of appetite, dullness, a sensation of being half-asleep, and a feeling of warmth in the abdomen with cold feet. This often arises after severe vomiting, diarrhea, or illness. Mr. Mao first uses Qingjin Pill to remove the accumulation, then employs Yungqi and Xingspi Powder for regulation. Regularly taking Wanling Pill and Baotong Pill will lead to recovery.</p>
<h3>Real Accumulation</h3>
<p>Symptoms include constipation, wind poison abscesses, throat closure, mumps, and gurgling saliva in the throat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Xuān Pǐ</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Máo discusses conditions in children aged five months to seven years who have masses in the abdomen, resembling the size of apricot kernels or eggs, that cause intermittent pain. These conditions are classified as follows: pain under the left rib is called &quot;Xuān Qì,&quot; while pain under both ribs is known as &quot;Pǐ Qì.&quot; Treating with a combination of Pēng É Zhú San and Jiàn Pí Yǐn will lead to recovery. If one observes dark complexion, direct gaze, black stool, cold nose and mouth, cold hands and feet, and refusal to eat, this is often fatal.</p>
<p>Mr. Qi states that in children, conditions such as Pǐ are due to undigested food, lingering in the abdomen, compounded by fluctuations in temperature, drinking water, or wheezing and coughing, resembling intermittent fever. If not treated early, it may lead to more severe conditions. Because of the involvement of Pǐ, children refuse to eat, resulting in weak spleen and stomach, causing heat to arise. Excessive drinking then washes out the intestines and stomach, leading to loss of fluids, which hinders the proper transformation of food, with a pulse that is deep and thin; the lack of food weakens the spleen and stomach, leading to inability to lift limbs, and various ailments can arise, resulting in wasting and further complications.</p>
<p>Rén Zhāi states: Pǐ is a membrane encasing fluid, lodged at the sides near the ribs, causing intermittent pain. Pǐ can trigger fevers and can produce chills and heat; thus, those suffering from malaria often accumulate yellow fluid in the abdomen, eventually resulting in Pǐ, and persistent chills and fevers can lead to this ailment. When a child&#39;s organs are balanced and harmonious, with proper flow of nutrients, even with excess water intake, they do not become ill.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is a disorder in breastfeeding, with the three burners being obstructed, this leads to stagnation of fluids, and the intestines and stomach are unable to function properly. If cold air attacks, it can gather and form a mass. For mild cases, use the Daodi Mu Xiang Pills, and for severe cases, use the Qu Pi Pills. </p>
<p>Zeng says: When infants are born, their endowments are not yet complete. If there is a lack of care in swaddling and a lack of regulation in breastfeeding, coupled with external injuries from the six excesses and internal weakness of the five organs, cold accumulates and stagnates in the spleen, unable to transform, leading to the formation of masses. These masses may protrude beneath the ribs, either to the left or right. The ailments arise from accumulated stagnation, causing cold and heat symptoms, abdominal pain, or cooler days and warmer nights.</p>
<p>The treatment method: For those with excess qi, it is necessary to warm and correct the stomach qi before administering Wu Xi Pills or Crystal Pills. After about three doses, stop with thin porridge and wait until the symptoms disappear before using tonifying agents. For those with qi deficiency, first regulate the spleen and stomach, stabilize the true essence, and slightly correct the complexion. Increase food intake and use the previous method for treatment. If there is severe deficiency, gradually dissolve with San Leng Powder or Hua Pi Pills, accommodating yin and yang, aiming for balance. However, first support, then drain, following the method of receiving and expelling to eliminate cold stagnation.</p>
<p>If the face is yellow, lips white, hair stands up, and the body is emaciated, this indicates extreme deficiency, and one should not hastily drain but rather use medicine slowly for digestion and regulation. If the child is small, ensure the wet nurse regularly consumes Ho Xiang decoction, allowing the medicine to pass through the milk, which is also of slight assistance.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>This phlegm is inside the abdomen and differs from the phlegm below the heart; it is advisable to take food pills regularly. However, since food pills contain croton seeds, can they be taken frequently? Gansui is highly toxic and causes diarrhea as if the rivers are breaking through; unless one is extremely robust, in a very dangerous state, or has a great amount of excess fluid—these three conditions must all be met—it should not be used lightly. Those who consider it a primary treatment for phlegm accumulation are mistaken. </p>
<p>If phlegm has persisted for a long time, appetite will decrease, causing a deficiency in the spleen and qi. If left untreated for a long time, the focus must first be on strengthening the stomach qi, so that effective nourishment can eliminate the accumulation by itself. If one desires to attack the accumulation directly, not only can it not be effectively removed, but it may also damage the spleen and earth, leading to various other symptoms due to the depletion of the spleen. Each case should be treated according to various symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Dietary Accumulation in Infants</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of accumulation in infants differ. Accumulation is caused by qi; it should not be treated lightly. When the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, food cannot be digested properly, and if breast milk is not administered appropriately, it leads to harm. Symptoms include a healthy body that feels warm, a warm breath in the mouth, a pale face, a swollen abdomen, dull eyes, excessive white in the eyes, a tendency to sleep, limbs that are limp, aversion to food, foul-smelling stools, or vomiting and diarrhea, indicating that food cannot be digested. Stabilizing medications should be used to resolve these issues; one should not hastily resort to strong medications. </p>
<p>In infants with strong qi and a robust spleen and stomach, digestive recovery can occur gradually. However, those with weak qi and a frail spleen and stomach will easily incur harm with even slight disruptions in nourishment.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<p>This remedy treats children suffering from chest and abdominal blockages, accumulation of phlegm and water. Even with the consumption of decoctions, the condition may temporarily improve but the masses remain, leading to a hard and bloated feeling beneath the heart. If pressed, the child cries, indicating underlying heat causing the blockage.</p>
<p>Take Gan Sui, processed to a yellow color, two and a half qian; combined with an equal amount of Qing Pi, Huang Qin, and Chuan Da Huang, each half a liang. Grind these into a coarse powder. Administer one qian with a bowl of water, decoct until reduced to two-thirds, discard the residue, and serve warm.

<p><strong>Jin Shi Wan for Food Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>This remedy treats undigested dairy food, resulting in bloating of the heart and abdomen, severe heat, wheezing, vomiting of phlegm, rumbling intestines, and diarrhea, especially with undigested grains. It also addresses conditions like dysentery with red and white stools, abdominal pain with a heavy feeling afterward, and issues like milk swellings and congested qi.</p>
<p>When there is heat and fullness in a child’s chest, retention of fluids in the abdomen leads to stagnation of the protective and nutritive qi, causing the gas in the abdomen to accumulate, resulting in bloating or excessive heat. For such conditions, one should clear and facilitate bowel movements regularly and break up accumulated qi.</p>
<p>The ingredients include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ba Dou Shuang, one qian</li>

<p><strong>Recipe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liqing Heat-clearing Decoction</strong> [from &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot;]</p>
<p>Used for treating children&#39;s food accumulation with stagnation heat, manifesting on the skin with alternating fever. It primarily regulates the interior and clears the heat of the yangming.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fried Atractylodes - 1 qian</li>
<li>Hawthorn - 1 qian</li>
<li>Fried White Peony - 1 qian</li>
<li>Fried Coptis - 7 fen</li>
<li>Fried Bitter Orange - 7 fen</li>
<li>Chuanxiong - 7 fen</li>
<li>Fried Cyperus - 7 fen</li>
<li>Shengma - 7 fen</li>
<li>Pueraria - 1 qian 2 fen</li>
<li>Honey-fried Licorice - 3 fen</li>
<li>Licorice - 3 fen</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare by decocting with ginger water. If the food accumulation is resolved but the alternating fever persists, reduce Hawthorn, Bitter Orange, Cyperus, and Chuanxiong, and add 5 fen each of Ginseng, Astragalus, and Dried Tangerine Peel, along with an additional 2-3 fen of Atractylodes. If there is phlegm, add 6 fen of Pinellia.</p>
<p>Xue Ji states: If the symptoms indicate that the food accumulation is resolved but the heat does not recede, use Wuwei Yigong Powder to replenish stomach qi. If there are symptoms of vomiting and reduced appetite, use Si Junzi Decoction with Agastache and Pinellia to stabilize the qi in the stomach. If diarrhea occurs and lacks appetite, it’s advisable to use Liu Junzi Decoction with Shengma and Chaihu to tonify spleen qi. If diarrhea persists for a long time, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to boost yang qi.</p>
<p>For deficiencies and coldness, add roasted Ginger and Muxiang; if ineffective, assist with Sishen Pill to tonify spleen and kidney. If the body is thin with alternating fever, thirst, and irregular bowel movements, use Fei’er Pill to resolve dietary accumulation. </p>
<p>If the distinction between spleen qi deficiency and food accumulation is unclear, it is advisable to avoid any measures that cold or clear heat, as they may further harm the spleen and stomach, leading to challenging conditions to treat.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ginseng Stomach Tranquil Powder</strong></p>
<p>This formula is used to treat weakness of the spleen and stomach, damage from excessive heat in milk and food, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ginseng: 1 qian</li>
<li>Astragalus: 2 qian</li>
<li>Raw licorice: 0.5 qian</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice: 0.5 qian</li>
<li>White peony root (stir-fried in wine): 0.7 qian</li>
<li>White poria: 0.4 qian</li>
<li>Aged orange peel: 0.3 qian</li>
<li>Stir-fried coptis: 0.2 qian</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind all ingredients into a powder. Dose: 2 qian each time, decocted in water.</p>
<p>Xue Ji says: According to Dongyuan, the Yi Huang Powder includes the spicy heat of clove and green tangerine peel, which is meant to counteract cold water&#39;s invasion of earth. If heat-damaging medicines like cassia seed cause harm to the spleen and stomach, or if summer heat injures the intake of milk and food leading to vomiting and diarrhea with a hot wind in the mouth and nose causing prolonged fright, this formula should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Yi Huang Powder</strong></p>
<p>This formula treats spleen deficiency leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite, with poor digestion of grains, fatigue, low energy, night-time bowel movements, wasting with night sweats, and drooling at the corners of the mouth.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aged orange peel: 1 liang</li>
<li>Clove: 2 qian</li>
<li>Haritaki (roasted and peeled): 0.5 liang</li>
<li>Green tangerine peel: 0.5 liang</li>
<li>Licorice (honey-fried): 0.5 liang</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind all ingredients into a powder. Dose: 1 qian each time, decocted in water.</p>
<p>Xue Ji says: In previous cases, if the spleen is deficient and cold or if cold water overcomes earth leading to vomiting and diarrhea, or if hands and feet are cold, or if phlegm rises with eyes half-open during sleep and there is a lack of desire for milk and food, this formula should be used. If the vomiting and diarrhea are due to spleen deficiency, use Six Gentleman Decoction with Chai Hu. If there is no response, or if the hands and feet are cold, it indicates true cold, and one should add wood fragrance and roasted ginger. If the issue arises from a wet nurse’s spleen deficiency and liver insult, one must treat with the previous formulas.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the wet nurse is extremely angry, it can lead to the child suffering from symptoms of illness. The mother should take a modified Gui Pi decoction. Wang Kentang said: Dongyuan states that Yan Xiaozhong compiled the Qian family&#39;s prescriptions to enhance Huang San for nourishing the earth. He also mentioned that when wind is strong, it must overcome the spleen&#39;s earth, so one must first strengthen the spleen. Those in ignorance do not discern the cold and heat within the spleen, treating all cases uniformly with spleen-nourishing medicines; they also fail to recognize that medicines containing cloves and citrus peels are pungent and warm, severely draining the lung&#39;s metal. How can one reverse the outflow in a case of spleen deficiency? It turns the cold water against the earth, causing cold-related vomiting, abdominal pain, greenish or white diarrhea, and a cold sensation in the mouth and nose. Huang San is the appropriate remedy for this condition. If, however, the illness arises from taking excessive hot medicines like ba dou, which harm the spleen and stomach, or if it is due to the heat accumulated during hot weather, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, with a hot sensation in the mouth and nose resulting in a state of chronic fright, it should not be used. Therefore, Ren Shen An Wei San should be prescribed.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>Preparation: Grind into a fine powder after lightly frying with honey wine. The dosage is one to two grams, to be decocted in water. </p>
<p>Xue Ji states: Based on the symptoms, if there is thirst with a preference for cold drinks, sleeping with eyes closed, and hands and feet feeling very hot, or if there is general yellowing of the body, it belongs to excess heat in the stomach channel, and Xiehuang Powder is appropriate. If there is thirst with a preference for soup, sleeping with eyes open, and hands and feet cold, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the stomach channel, appropriate for Yi Gong Powder. If the face is pale and the person frequently craves milk food, this suggests liver overacting on the spleen, and the remedy is the Secret Formula to Tonify the Spleen Decoction. If there is a red face with anxiety, body heat, and drowsiness, it indicates heart overacting on the spleen, appropriate for the Secret Formula to Calm the Spirit Pill. If the face is pale with wheezing, fatigue in the limbs, this indicates lung overacting on the spleen, appropriate for the Restore the Middle and Augment Qi Decoction. If there is blackened lips with diarrhea, and cold in the hands and feet, this indicates kidney overacting on the spleen, suitable for the Benefit Yellow Powder. After illness, if there is insufficient body fluids, dry mouth, and thirst, the Seven Flavor Bai Zhu Powder is recommended. If a nursing mother consumes rich foods that cause internal heat from emotional distress, her condition should be examined and treated.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

<p>For a child’s disorder, take the peeled Li Ren (apricot kernel) and double kernels, remove the skin, and pound them together with dry flour. Form into cakes; if too dry, mix with plain water, shaping them to the size of the patient’s palm to make two cakes. Lightly roast them until they are yellow, but do not let them cook completely. Eat one on an empty stomach; it should be effective. If not effective, eat another one. Drinking hot congee can also aid efficiency. Efficiency is the measure. If by afternoon the condition doesn&#39;t improve, stop with vinegar rice. After passing, the patient should feel weak. If the illness has not fully resolved, based on what can be tolerated, take an additional dose after one or two days, limiting it to the end of the illness. For children, also gauge as needed. They must avoid eating dairy and beef or horse meat, as there will be no benefit. For those with severe illness, reduce the amount of Li Ren with flour; for lighter cases, adjust accordingly while still measuring strength. With repeated trials, efficacy is guaranteed, achieving remarkable results.</p>

This is because when fruits are combined with musk, they drop, and wood combined with cinnamon becomes brittle.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a child experiences abdominal fullness and is unable to eat or drink, the treatment involves using moxibustion on the Xuan Zhong point. </p>
<p>The &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; states: To treat children with intestinal issues, perform moxibustion three times an inch below each nipple. The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Tong&quot; mentions that for children with phlegm issues, apply moxibustion on the Zhang Men and along the spine; for accumulation and diarrhea issues, perform moxibustion seven times on both sides near the lower part of the eleventh vertebra, about one and a half inches apart. </p>
<p>Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng&quot; states that if a child&#39;s phlegm condition does not resolve after a long time, moxibustion seven times each on the Zhong Wan point and the two Zhang Men points is indicated. The Zhang Men point is located on the lateral side, directly outside the navel, at the edge of the ribcage below the left and right armpits. The child should lie sideways, bend one leg up and extend the other down, raising the arm to access the points. The Zhong Wan point is one inch below the upper abdominal point, four inches above the navel, located between the heart&#39;s covering bones and the navel itself. After finding the appropriate points, apply moxibustion seven times in total on the area around the navel and the mid-spine, without exception. </p>
<p>The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Jian&quot; explains that for phlegm treatment, the moxibustion points are in the center of the child&#39;s back, starting from the tailbone and feeling along the spine for two points where the blood vessels are active. For each point, place a three-wen copper coin on it and burn mugwort in the coin&#39;s hole, moxibustion seven times. These are the root points for phlegm, where blood flows. If moxibustion is applied properly, lesions will appear and effects can be seen; if it does not reach the blood vessels, then lesions will not appear and the treatment will be ineffective.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

<p>Qian Yi in &quot;Pediatric Direct Method&quot; states: Cao Xuande&#39;s son, three years old, had a yellow complexion, intermittent fevers, lacked appetite while excessively drinking water, and could not stop vomiting after drinking milk. Various doctors believed it to be tidal fever and treated it with cattle bile pills and musk pills without improvement. When using a thirst-quenching decoction, he vomited. Qian concluded: &quot;A white cake should be given to clear the body, and then tonify the spleen.&quot; So, he ground up digestion pills, determining it was a form of accumulation. Eventually, the child recovered. Why? The lack of food and excessive drinking caused food to stagnate in the intestines, leading to intermittent fevers. Vomiting after taking thirst-quenching medicine happened due to the medicine clashing with the spleen; once purged, recovery followed.</p>
<p>Luo Tianyi in &quot;Precious Mirror of Health&quot; mentions: The overall governor of Zhen Ding, Dong Gong&#39;s eldest grandson, aged eleven, suffered from accumulation and hard masses under the left rib, a distended abdomen with visible veins, fevers, warm skin, coughing with spontaneous sweating, particularly severe in the afternoon, foul breath from dental issues, bleeding gums, and fatigue in the limbs, with reduced appetite; the illness was quite critical. The imperial physician Liu Zhong&#39;an was summoned for treatment and estimated recovery in about a hundred days. He was first given a dose of agarwood and sea sand pills, which expelled two or three bowel movements; the next day, he took a flatulence pill; after ten days, he repeated the agarwood and sea sand pills for relief, followed by another dose of the flatulence pills. This interchange continued for over a month, with the accumulation halving, and within a hundred days, he was fully recovered. In recent years, this ailment has become more common, and many have recovered; it is recorded to aid future patients.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Young Child&#39;s Formulas&quot; states: The young lady of Deputy Minister Zhang from the Ministry of Revenue has suffered from a long-standing accumulation of stagnation and blockages. She experiences a distended abdomen with strong heat, constipation, and a loss of appetite. All the doctors diagnosed her with a condition of deficient heat and fever. Some attributed her symptoms to a cold stomach, suggesting treatments for loss of appetite. However, her lack of eating naturally resulted in less urination and defecation. They considered treating her with remedies for malnutrition, but after trying various medicines without success, her condition had become dire, prompting them to request my assistance. Upon being asked which medicines should be taken, I advised them to use Gan Sui and Da Huang. They were alarmed, saying that previous doctors had only prescribed tonics. This young woman had not eaten or drunk for a long time; thus, it was not appropriate to stimulate her intestines and stomach. I replied, &quot;Those who trust me will live; those who oppose me will die.&quot; Zhang then inquired if there were alternative recipes without Gan Sui. I instructed them to administer the Da Cheng Qi Decoction immediately. After two doses, she recovered. The next day, upon examination, there was still some residual blockages, and it was certain that within a few days, the condition would reoccur. She needed to take the previous medicine again to eliminate the root cause. A few days later, when she indeed faced blockage again, with a distended abdomen and hardness, after taking the medicine once more, she was completely cured.</p>
<p>&quot;The Golden Mirror of Infant Care&quot; states: A child exhibited a pale yellow complexion and burped sour gas. After administering a dose of Ping Wei San, the accumulated food was rapidly digested. I mentioned that there was no need for many medicines, just regulate their diet for recovery. However, not believing this, they caused further food injuries, resulting in burping and sourness. They used other medicines to combat the stagnation, leading to increased vomiting and diarrhea, ultimately resulting in a critical situation.

I used rhubarb wine to wash it, combined with slightly roasted pepper, ground them into a fine powder and mixed them equally, forming honey pills the size of tung seeds. Each dose consisted of fifty pills, taken with musk water on an empty stomach. After ten doses, all the gas lumps disappeared. For children, smaller pills were used, while adults used larger ones.

Avoid excessive doses; once 80% of the illness was alleviated, stop taking to allow complete recovery.&quot;</p>

<p>Another small child had a pale face and suddenly showed slight movements of the lips. At times, the complexion turned yellow and green.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from a distended belly and took medicine to eliminate stagnation. I believed that when both the physical and pathological qi are excessive, purging should be done, not tonifying; when both are deficient, tonifying should be done, not purging. The previous symptoms indicated a deficiency in both the physical and pathological aspects, and merely tonifying the middle qi would not lead to recovery. Disbelieving this, they continued to attack the condition, resulting in a depletion of original qi, leading to virtual heat rising, causing gum erosion and submandibular nodules. I used a large dose of herbs like Dahuang and others, and the child soon recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had a loss of appetite accompanied by fever, took herbs such as Qiong and Lian, but their food intake decreased daily, leading to abdominal distension and emaciation. I noted that the spleen was weak and food was stagnating, resulting in further damage to the original qi. I first used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding a few doses of Muscone and other ingredients, which gradually improved the condition. I then used Liujun Decoction and fried ginger for regulation and stabilization.</p>
<p>A child who loved to eat meat experienced abdominal pain with irregular bowel movements. After half a year, their abdomen swelled, and a hard lump formed in the right side, occasionally shifting. Three months later, another lump formed in the left side, and there was abdominal distension, with sore gums and thirst. Their urine was either reddish and thin or clear, and their stool color was inconsistent and foul. After another half year, three to five nodules appeared under the jaw. They took medicines to dissolve lumps and eliminate stagnation, depleting their original qi further and worsened the lumps. I used the Si Wei Fei Er Wan and Wu Wei Yi Gong San, adjusting treatment according to the symptoms, which gradually alleviated the thirst and heat. After about a month, the abdominal distension began to decrease, and I added Jiu Wei Lu Hui Wan, leading to gradual healing of the gums.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child has irregular eating habits, sometimes experiencing diarrhea, abdominal pain, or bloating, with a hard lump in the abdomen and irregular bowel movements. The child feels thirsty with a fever, and has swollen gums and bad breath. The treatment of using digestive aids only exacerbates the prior symptoms, leading to further weight loss. I remarked: the complexion is yellow with a hint of green, indicating depletion of the spleen and insult from the liver. The method should be to harmonize and replenish the central qi while calming the liver to strengthen the spleen’s qi, thus naturally relieving the fire of deficiency and allowing all symptoms to heal. Consequently, herbal formulas such as the Monthly Harmonizing Decoction and Large Artemisia Decoction were administered, and the child was indeed cured.</p>
<p>Another young child presented with lower abdominal distension and difficulty urinating, especially worse in the morning. A decoction to replenish the central qi and boost energy was prescribed, adding costus as well as a morning formula, while a modified version of Five-Flavored Decoction with added Cimicifuga and Bupleurum was given at night. After over two months, the child recovered. However, after a loss of dietary regulation, the child experienced abdominal bloating and sour belching, for which Five-Flavored Decoction and Four-Ingredient Euonymus Pill were used, leading to a cure. Later, after a marriage, the child fell ill again with similar symptoms, compounded by severe cold, abdominal chill, clear frequent urination, and unsettled stools, with cold hands and feet. The treatment involved the Replenishing Central Qi Decoction and Eight-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, which soon brought recovery.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child experienced abdominal distension from overeating, with a feeling of fullness in the chest and phlegm present. I administered Yigong San, and he recovered. Later, after overeating again, he suffered abdominal distension with pain. Even with medication taken to purge, although the pain ceased, the distension worsened and he experienced further wheezing. This indicated damage to the spleen&#39;s energy affecting the lungs, so I used Liu Jun, with Jie Geng for nourishment, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child had abdominal distension, aversion to food, cold and heat sensations, and nausea, resembling an exterior wind attack. I noted that the pulse at the qi point was larger than at Renying, indicating stagnation of food and drink. I prescribed a dose of Baohe Wan, and all symptoms promptly receded. However, the abdominal distension persisted, so I treated with Yigong San, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child suffering from a cold had a cough with phlegm. I treated him with Liu Jun, Jie Geng, Sang Pi, and Xing Ren, leading to recovery. Subsequently, he experienced stagnation of food and had symptoms of diarrhea, distension, and pain. I added Shan Zha and Hou Po to Liu Jun, which provided relief. When he then experienced vomiting from food stoppage, taking medication for purging worsened his cough. I suggested that this indicated a deficiency in both the spleen and lungs and needed adjustment and nourishment. He thought it was a slow treatment, so he took diaphoretic and purgative medicines instead, which exacerbated the previous symptoms and led to increased shaking of the head. I then used Tianma San, significantly adding Diaoteng Hook and Yigong San, and he ultimately recovered.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child experiences abdominal swelling and pain, alternating between cold and heat, and cries when pressure is applied to the abdomen; this is due to food stagnation. First, administer a dose of Baohe Wan, and the symptoms will improve. If there is increased thirst and pressing on the abdomen does not cause crying, this indicates that the food has been eliminated but the spleen&#39;s qi has not yet recovered. Treat with Wuwei Yigong San, adding Chaihu, and the child will improve.</p>
<p>Another child has food stagnation and takes medication to dissolve it. Once the food has been digested, the heat has not yet subsided, indicating deficiency heat in the stomach channel. Use Liujunzi Tang with added Chaihu and Shengma for four doses to alleviate the condition.</p>
<p>A child who initially had food stagnation took medication to counteract it, but experienced increased abdominal pain; pressing stops the pain. The remaining treatment is with Liujunzi Decoction to achieve recovery. Later, there is renewed food injury; administer Baohe Wan along with Sanleng and Binglang. If there is increased heaviness in the abdomen with favorable belching, this points to deficient spleen qi leading to descent. Continue treating with the previous decoction, adding Shengma and Chaihu for recovery.</p>
<p>A child has a pale complexion, difficulty digesting food, and frequent diarrhea. Using medications for dissolving accumulation and transforming phlegm does not yield results over time. I suggest it is due to spleen and stomach weakness; use Liujunzi Tang to gradually improve. Some believe it to be food accumulation needing expulsion, which leads to diarrhea, phlegm, and spasms. I say the spleen qi is further harmed, unable to nourish the lungs, and the deficiency in the lungs cannot pacify the liver, causing these symptoms. First, use Liujunzi with added Diaoteng Gou, and restrict food intake; further use Wuwei Yigong San with added Shengma will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from abdominal pain due to heat accumulation, took a purgative, but continued to have a fever and undigested stools. Upon examination, there was no pain when pressing the abdomen, and the child refused cold water. This indicated that the food stagnation had resolved, but the spleen&#39;s energy was weak. A combination of the Five-Flavor Formula was prescribed with added Angelica and Cimicifuga, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child had abdominal distension and took areca nut, dragon&#39;s blood, bitter orange, and coptis, which aggravated the distension. I said: This is due to deficiency in the spleen and blood stagnation; it should not be attacked directly. The Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Angelica was prescribed. After several doses, the stomach energy gradually recovered, and symptoms improved. In the morning, the Five-Flavor Formula with added Cimicifuga and Bupleurum was used, with the same formula plus Angelica and Peony in the evening, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A different young child had a persistent abdominal blockage, became emaciated, and developed a growing abdomen, experienced chills and fever, was lethargic, and craved water. The main treatment was a formula based on Atractylodes, supplemented with Four-Flavor Fat Child Pills. After a month, various symptoms gradually improved.</p>
<p>Lastly, one child had abdominal blockage, felt hot like fire, exhibited various symptoms too extensive to detail, was treated with the Five-Flavor Formula in the morning and Four-Flavor Fat Child Pills in the evening. After a month, symptoms slightly improved; with the addition of Rehmannia Pills, the child could possibly walk. Consequently, Rehmannia Pills were used in the morning, and the Five-Flavor Formula along with Shrimp (or insect herb) Pills in the evening. After several doses, the child was cured.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>
