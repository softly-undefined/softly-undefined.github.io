<p><strong>Ear Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Vital Energy Connecting to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>The yang energy expands when overworked, becoming depleted, and obstructs accumulation in the summer, causing people to suffer heatstroke, resulting in blindness and inability to see, and ear closure leading to incapacity to hear, feeling dazed as if the city is collapsing, and gushing continuously without stopping. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This indicates that overwork injures the yang energy. The essence of yin and yang lies in yang being dense and stable. Overwork causes the yang energy to spread outward, preventing yin from obtaining the warmth and stability of yang, thus the essence escapes and becomes depleted internally. In autumn and winter, the yang energy is stored internally, while in summer it expands outward, hence leading to increased deficiency and heatstroke. With the essence and energy being deficient, blindness occurs, preventing sight, and ear closure leads to inability to hear.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is said: If the yang cannot overcome its yin, then the energies of the five organs contend, and the nine orifices will be blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The five organs represent yin, while the nine orifices are vessels that receive the energy. If the yin is excessive and the yang cannot overcome it, then the energies of the five organs clash internally, causing the nine orifices to be obstructed.</p>
<p><strong>Jinkui&#39;s True Words Treatise</strong></p>
<p>The southern region is red, entering and connecting to the heart, opening up to the ears.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The section on diseases of the organs states: the separate energy flows to the ears to create hearing. The separate energy is governed by the heart&#39;s energy. Hence, it is said that the heart opens up to the ears.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>On the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The north brings cold; in the organs, it relates to the kidneys; in the orifices, it relates to the ears. </p>
<p><em>Note: The qi of the kidneys communicates with the ears; when the kidneys are harmonious, the ears can hear the five tones. Thus, the qi of the kidneys opens to the ears.</em> </p>
<p>At the age of fifty, a person&#39;s body becomes heavy, and the ears and eyes no longer perceive clearly. </p>
<p><em>Note: At fifty, both the essence and blood become deficient. When deficient, they cannot ascend, leading to unclear hearing and sight.</em> </p>
<p>The wise possess surplus energy; with surplus energy, the ears and eyes become perceptive. </p>
<p><em>Note: With surplus energy, the yang is abundant, hence the clarity of the ears and eyes.</em> </p>
<p>The heavens are insufficient in the northwest, therefore the northwest is considered yin; and the right ear and eye of a person are not as bright as the left. </p>
<p><em>Note: The insufficiency of the heavens in the northwest indicates a deficiency of yin among the yang. In humans, the left side represents yang, while the right side represents yin. When yin is deficient above, the right ear and eye are not as bright as the left.</em> </p>
<p>The east is yang; that which is yang gathers essence above. When it gathers essence above, the upper part thrives while the lower part becomes deficient, resulting in perceptive ears and eyes, but the hands and feet are not as agile. The west is yin; that which is yin gathers essence below. When it gathers essence below, the lower part thrives while the upper part is deficient, resulting in unclear ears and eyes but agile hands and feet. Hence, when subjected to pathogens, the affliction is more pronounced in the right if affected above, and more pronounced in the left if affected below. This is something that cannot be entirely fulfilled by the yin and yang of heaven and earth, hence pathogens reside there. </p>
<p><em>Note: This indicates that the yin and yang of heaven, earth, and the human body’s left and right sides cannot be entirely fulfilled. Therefore, humans ought to align with heaven and earth to nourish their heads and feet, and not allow pathogens to reside.</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Those afflicted with confusion and turmoil suffer from blurred vision and hearing loss. The lower portion is full while the upper portion is empty, leading to stagnation in the lesser yang and the jueyin, which may even extend to the liver.<br>[Note: The jueyin liver is connected to the eyes, and the lesser yang channel extends to the ears. When there is excess at the lower portion, the vital energy cannot ascend, resulting in blurred vision and hearing loss. The deficiency above causes movement in sight to become dim and confused, creating great disruption. This initially injures the vital energy and leads to a deficiency above, with subsequent worsening of the excess below.]</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion of the Essentials of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the lesser yang is exhausted, hearing loss occurs, and all joints become slack. Vision becomes utterly disconnected. When this disconnection happens, death is imminent in a day and a half. In death, the complexion first turns blue and white, and thereafter one passes away.<br>[Note: The channels of the lesser yang in the hands and feet trace to the ears, hence the hearing loss when the vital energy is cut off. The lesser yang governs the bones, and since all joints relate to bones, slackness in all joints occurs when the lesser yang energy is exhausted. The lesser yang channel reaches the sharp corners of the eyes, and when it is finished, it pulls at the eyes, causing startled and distorted vision. The lesser yang is associated with the kidney, which houses the will; if the connection to the eyes is severed, the will is lost first, leading to imminent death within a day and a half. The blue color represents the energy of wood, while the white color signifies the internal loss of the essence of the triple burner.] </p>
<p><strong>On the True Organ of the Jade Mechanism</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When the spleen is insufficient, it causes the nine orifices to become obstructed, leading to a condition known as &quot;heavy strength.&quot; The commentary states: if the five organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices will not be unblocked. Now that the energy of the spleen is insufficient, the energies of the five organs are also not harmonious. The stomach, as the Yang of the earth, has strong energy, while the spleen, as the Yin of the earth, has weak energy. When the spleen is weak and unable to take in the essential energies from food and water, the stomach&#39;s energy becomes even stronger; hence, it is called &quot;heavy strength.&quot; This means the spleen&#39;s deficiency prevents it from transporting fluids for the stomach. The stomach is strong while the spleen is weak, resulting in disharmony between the organs.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden faintness and deafness, where there is obstruction and inability to communicate internally, the internal energy must be greatly diminished. This does not arise from wind-induced conditions inside or outside; therefore, the patient is left weak. The commentary notes: faintness and deafness arise from reversed energy rising upwards, obstructing the upper orifices. When there is blocking and stagnation below, reversed energy descends, resulting in the obstruction of the lower orifices. This indicates both internal and external afflictions leading to obstructed orifices. If one does not succumb to internal worries and anger or external wind leading to severe illness or early demise, it results from physical weakness and diminished energy, causing a thin frame and delicate skin.</p>
<p>Disharmony among the five organs leads to blocking within the six hollow organs. Symptoms like headaches and tinnitus arise from the obstruction of the nine orifices, which in turn is produced by issues in the stomach and intestines. The commentary clarifies: when the energies of the five organs are long-term reversed and thus remain unharmonized, it produces blockages in the six hollow organs. When the six hollow organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices will not function properly. The interrelatedness of Yin and Yang within the organs is such that external symptoms reflect internal troubles; thus, blockages within give rise to obstructions in the orifices.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>Hot Discussions</h3>
<p>For three days of the cold damage, the lesser yang is affected. The lesser yang governs the gallbladder, and its pulse runs along the side and connects at the ear; hence, there is chest and side pain along with deafness. After nine days, the lesser yang illness weakens, and the deafness is faintly discernible. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The energy of the lesser yang governs the pivot and the gallbladder; when the gallbladder&#39;s energy rises, all the yang energies rise correspondingly, as if prompted by cold that seeks to move the pivot. All yang energies emerge from the pivot and sides to the skin surface. The greater yang governs the exterior, the yangming governs the muscles, and the lesser yang governs the chest and flanks. Chest and flank pain combined with deafness indicates a disease in the energy manifesting as tangible symptoms. </p>
<p>When the disease is affected by cold in both aspects, after three days, both the lesser yang and the jueyin become ill, leading to deafness, retraction of the pouch and cold extremities, inability to ingest liquids, and unconsciousness, resulting in death on the sixth day.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lesser yang and jueyin are interrelated; thus, the manifestation of deafness in the lesser yang corresponds with the retraction and cold extremities in the jueyin. Inability to ingest liquids indicates a complete loss of digestive energy. Unconsciousness suggests damage to the spirit energy. When all organs and viscera are afflicted and the protective and nutritive energies fail to circulate, the exhaustion of energy leads to death.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The reverse of the hand Taiyang leads to deafness, tears flow, and the neck cannot turn while the waist cannot bend or straighten; this treats the diseases of the master.</p>
<p>(Note: The diseases born from the hand Taiyang involve deafness. The small intestine governs fluids, hence the reversal leads to tears. The heart governs blood vessels, while the small intestine governs fluids and represents the heart externally. If the qi of the small intestine reverses, then the fluids cannot nourish the meridians, which is why the neck cannot turn and the waist cannot bend or straighten. The area between the waist and neck is where the major pathways of the meridians converge.)</p>
<p>The reversal of Shaoyang leads to sudden deafness, swelling and heat in the cheeks, side pain, and the ankle cannot move.</p>
<p>(Note: The meridian of the foot Shaoyang begins at the corner of the eye, travels behind the ear into the ear canal, descends to the jaw, runs through the chest and sides, exits at the outer knee, and follows along the foot. Therefore, the reversal leads to sudden deafness, cheek swelling, side pain, and the foot ankle cannot move.)</p>
<hr>
<p>The so-called tinnitus of Taiyang arises from the exuberance of yang energy, which makes everything thrive and leap, hence the ringing in the ears.</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the increased vitality of yang energy. In spring, during the third month, what is referred to as spring emergence occurs when heaven and earth give birth, and all things flourish. Thus, the energy of heaven and earth thrives and leaps upwards. Likewise, the yang energy in humans also flourishes upwards, leading to congestion in the meridians and causing tinnitus.)</p>
<p>The so-called floating deafness of Taiyang is entirely due to qi.</p>
<p>(Note: This clarifies the differentiations of meridian qi. The ringing, where yang energy is exuberant and leads to tinnitus, is due to qi affecting the meridians. However, the so-called floating deafness is entirely due to qi.)<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p>
<h3>Commentary on the Prohibition of Assassins</h3>
<p>The assassin&#39;s master improperly collapses the central meridian, causing internal leakage and deafness.<br><em>[Note: This suggests that if the assassin&#39;s master over-indulges, he mistakenly affects the internal collapse of the meridian, resulting in leakage and deafness in the ears.]</em></p>
<h3>Needle Release Chapter</h3>
<p>The five senses of hair, teeth, ears, and eyes respond to the five sounds, corresponding to the five notes and six scales.<br><em>[Note: Hair, teeth, ears, and eyes total six, while teeth alone count for six, and the number of hairs cannot be counted. The mathematical system of rhythms can extend infinitely; hence, its number surpasses even ten thousand, illustrating the endless interconnections between heaven, earth, and humanity.]</em></p>
<h3>Great Discussion on Qi Transformation</h3>
<p>In a year with excessive fire, intense heat circulates, afflicting the lungs (metal) with malevolent influences, causing the people to suffer from malaria with low energy, coughs and wheezing, blood overflow and profuse bleeding, dry throat and deafness.<br><em>[Note: In a year where fire is overly dominant, it overwhelms metal, hence the lungs are afflicted. The lungs are the origin of water; excessive heat damages metal and depletes this source. The kidneys open to the ears, thus kidney deficiency leads to deafness.]</em> </p>
<p>In a year with excessive metal, dry air circulates, affecting the liver (wood). The people suffer from pain in the sides and lower abdomen, eye redness and painful sores, and are unable to hear.<br><em>[Note: In years dominated by metal, the prevalence of dry air causes liver ailments, resulting in deafness due to liver deficiency.]</em><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Five Constant Virtues</strong></p>
<p>The Yin aspect governs heaven; the wind and air descend, the spleen&#39;s energy rises. The body feels heavy, muscles weaken, appetite decreases, and the mouth feels dry; the eyes shift, and there is ringing in the ears. 【Note: The shifting of the eyes and ringing in the ears is due to the influence of wind above.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Six Fundamentals</strong></p>
<p>The Shao Yang governs heaven; people suffer from deafness and dimness of vision. 【Note: Deafness and dimness are due to the internal influence of wind and heat.】 The Yin aspect governs heaven; the energy of the Three causes ringing in the ears and dizziness. 【Note: Ringing in the ears and dizziness arise from wind-related illness above.】 When wood is obstructed, it becomes severe; thus, ears ring and dizziness occurs. 【Note: Ringing in the ears and dizziness are the result of wind energy causing illness.】 For the Shao Yang, this leads to throat blockage, ear ringing, and vomiting. 【Note: This is a common illness in autumn.】 When wood is obstructed, people suffer from pain in the stomach and pericardium, discomfort in the upper sides, blockage in the diaphragm and throat, inability to ingest food and drink; in severe cases, there is ringing in the ears and dizziness, and one cannot recognize others, often collapsing. 【Note: This results from the influence of the heavenly principle at the spring, leading to extreme obstruction, retaliating against its seasonal energy. For example, in the Ding Mao and Ding You years, the minor wood energy rises to meet the Yang Ming; in the Ren Zi and Ren Wu years, the major wood energy rises while the Yang Ming is at the spring, leading to extreme wood energy. This causes blockage in the stomach, diaphragm, and throat, preventing food and drink intake, with wood overwhelming and harming earth. Discomfort in the upper sides and ringing and dizziness in the ears follow. The inability to recognize people indicates a wind-related illness.】<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Primordial Truth</strong></p>
<p>When the Liver (Taiyin) excels, it causes ringing in the ears and dizziness.<br>[Note: The influence of the external wind and wood elements surpasses above, hence the ear ringing and dizziness.] When the Liver excels, it leads to ear ringing, head dizziness, nausea, and a sensation of cold in the stomach.<br>[Note: Ear ringing and head dizziness arise because the wood element is excessive above. Nausea and a cold sensation in the stomach indicate a stomach disorder.] When the Gallbladder (Shaoyang) excels, it brings heat to the stomach, causing restlessness, heart pain, reddened eyes, nausea, sour vomiting, a good appetite, ear pain, red urine, fright, delirium, and lower abdominal pain with darkened or light-colored discharge. The treatment involves using warming and cold herbs, complemented by sweet and salty flavors to facilitate drainage.<br>[Note: The influence of the Gallbladder excels in the Triple Warmer, hence the heat affecting the stomach. The essence of the Triple Warmer originates from the stomach. The Triple Warmer and the heart are closely connected, causing restlessness and heart pain. The channels of the Triple Warmer ascend to the ears and connect to the eyes, which is why excessive influence manifests as ear pain.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when it is afflicted, symptoms include sneezing, stiffness in the neck, heat in the shoulders and back, headaches, shortness of breath, fever, deafness, and closed eyes. </p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yin governing the heavens corresponds to the energy associated with the Jueyin wood of wind, where deafness indicates an excess of Jueyin energy.)</p>
<p>The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; when it is afflicted, it results in external rashes and sores, vomiting, throat obstruction, headaches and throat swelling, deafness, bleeding, and internal conditions of convulsions. When there is excess, it leads to fullness in the chest, cough, and possibly blood.</p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yang governing the heavens corresponds to the initial phase of the three energies, being the dual fires of the monarch and minister. Symptoms like deafness are indicative of diseases caused by wind and fire.)</p>
<p>In years of the Greater Yin, people suffer from deafness, disorientation, and throat swelling and obstruction.</p>
<p>(Note: The Greater Yin corresponds to the years of Chen and Xu. The afflictions of deafness are linked to diseases of the Sanjiao meridian.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Lingshu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Pathological Symptoms of Organs from Evils</strong></p>
<p>When the heart meridian is slightly obstructed, it causes tinnitus.<br>[Note: The red color associated with the southern region enters the heart and opens the orifice to the ears. A slight obstruction in the heart meridian indicates a deficiency in heart qi, leading to tinnitus.] The twelve meridians and three hundred sixty-five collaterals all have blood and qi that rise to the face and traverse the hollow orifices; their associated qi travels to the ears to facilitate hearing.<br>[Note: The associated qi refers to the heart and kidney qi that go to the ears and enable hearing.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The small intestine hand taiyang is responsible for diseases arising from bodily fluids, leading to hearing loss, jaundice, and facial swelling. The triple burner hand shaoyang, when activated, causes hearing loss, dizziness, swelling of the throat, and throat obstruction.<br>[Note: All of these are ailments corresponding to the pathways of the meridians.] The hand yangming collaterals connect to the ears, resulting in deafness.<br>[Note: This is due to qi stagnation causing the deafness.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Tendons</strong></p>
<p>The tendon of the hand taiyang has branches that enter the ear and a straight pathway that extends above and below the ear; the corresponding ailment results in ringing in the ears and pain that radiates to the jaw.<br>[Note: This illness arises from the path traversed by the taiyang tendon.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Pulse Measurement</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The kidney&#39;s vitality is connected to the ears; when the kidneys are harmonious, the ears can perceive the five sounds. If the five organs are not in harmony, then the seven orifices are not open. </p>
<p>In the section on heat illnesses, when one does not know the source of pain, and experiences deafness and cannot hear oneself, along with dryness of the mouth and excessive yang heat—if there is also considerable cold from yin, then the heat is within the marrow, leading to death if not treated.  </p>
<p>In the section of inquiries, the Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What energy causes ringing in the ears?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;In the ears, there is a concentration of the ancestral vessels. When the stomach is empty, the ancestral vessels become deficient; when they are deficient, energy flows downwards, leading to a depletion of the pulse, and hence the ringing in the ears.&quot; </p>
<p>The lungs are related to the hundred pulses, and the ancestral vessels are the root of these hundred pulses, governed by the lungs. The ears are where the ancestral vessels gather. The blood and energy of the hundred pulses are produced by food and water. Therefore, when the stomach is empty, the ancestral vessels are deficient, causing the energy of the pulses to flow downwards. When the blood and energy within the pulse are depleted, it leads to ringing in the ears. Additionally, if the upper qi is insufficient, the ears suffer from painful ringing.</p>
<p>This indicates that the bladder lacks sufficient fluids and cannot moisten the empty orifices, resulting in insufficient righteous qi and the emergence of strange and evil diseases.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Teacher&#39;s Transmission Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys govern the external, enabling distant hearing. Observe the qualities of the ears to understand their nature.</p>
<p><strong>Deciding Qi Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If essence is depleted, hearing loss occurs; if fluid is deficient, bones are unable to bend or extend properly, complexion fades, brain marrow diminishes, shins ache, and the ears ring frequently. </p>
<p><strong>Sea Discussion</strong></p>
<p>If the sea of marrow is insufficient, there will be dizziness and ringing in the ears.</p>
<p><strong>Five Views and Five Functions Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The ears are the organ of the kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>Organs Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Small and dark ears indicate weak kidneys, coarse ears imply strong kidneys; high ears suggest high kidneys, while sunken ears indicate lower kidney function; firm ears show strong kidneys, whereas thin and soft ears suggest weak kidneys; ears that sit forward show correct kidney alignment, while ears that are placed high indicate a tilt in kidney position.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Wei Qi</strong></p>
<p>The sign of the foot Shaoyang is located in front of the ear orifice and emerges from the street of head Qi. The ear orifice refers to the ear.</p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on Yin and Yang with Twenty-Five Individuals</strong></p>
<p>Above the hand Shaoyang, when blood Qi is abundant, the color of the ear is pleasing; when blood Qi is deficient, the ear appears dark and unattractive. </p>
<p><strong>The Difficulties of Bian Que’s Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reason Ears Can Hear Sounds</strong></p>
<p>In the fortieth difficulty, it is said: the lung governs sound, the ear is the opening of the kidney and is able to hear sounds; what does this signify? Indeed. The kidney corresponds to the water of the northern direction. Water is born in Shen, and Shen corresponds to the western metal; metal corresponds to the lung, which governs sound, thus allowing the ear to hear sounds. The lung is metal, and sounds arise from metal; hence, the lung governs sound. Although the nose belongs to the lung and cannot hear sounds, the ear belongs to the kidney and is able to hear. How is this possible? The kidney corresponds to the northern water and the branches of Shen, You, and Xu. Shen is the place where metal is exalted. Metal in the viscera is the lung, which governs sound. Although the ear belongs to the kidney—water—it is derived from the position of the lung, which is metal, thus enabling the ear to hear sounds.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The Classic of the Hidden Writings by Hua Tuo</p>

<p>The kidney is the residence of the spirit and the root of life, externally connected to the ears.</p>
<p><strong>Deafness</strong></p>
<p>If liver qi is counterflowing, it causes headaches and deafness with a flushed face. The pulse is deep and rapid, or floating and rapid. If the ears are unable to hear and the pulse is floating, large, and slack, it indicates impending death.</p>
<p><strong>Ominous Signs of Ear Conditions</strong></p>
<p>If black color appears in the ears and eyes, gradually entering the mouth, it signifies death. If red color is seen in the ears, eyes, and forehead, death occurs within five days. If there is dryness in the ears due to kidney deficiency, death follows in six days.</p>
<p><strong>The Classic of the Primordial Yin by Huangfu Mi</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Connection of the Kidney and the Ear</strong></p>
<p>The kidney qi connects to the ears; when the ears are harmonious, one can hear the five sounds. The classic states, &quot;The kidney manifests in the orifices as the ear.&quot; Thus, kidney qi ascends to the ears and descends to the yin.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Burning and Dryness</strong></p>
<p>If the ears are burnt and dry due to dust and filth, the illness resides in the bones.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Instruction of the Ren Zhai by Yang Shiying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deafness</strong><a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The kidneys connect to the ears, and they govern essence. When essence and vital energy are balanced and kidney energy is abundant, the ears are able to hear clearly. However, if excessive labor injures the blood and vital energy, or if wind pathogens attack a weakened state, causing the essence to dissipate and the kidneys to weaken, then hearing may turn to deafness. There are also cases of deafness caused by qi obstruction, by wind invasion, or by labor damage. The twelve meridians converge at the ears; when the yin and yang channels intersect appropriately, the organ energy may reverse and lead to obstruction, which then affects the ears—this is known as obstructive deafness, and dizziness may accompany it at times.</p>
<p>The ears are connected to the governing vessel; if the vessel is vacuous and wind pathogens invade, wind enters the channels of the ears, obstructing the normal flow of energy—this is referred to as wind deafness, often accompanied by headaches. If excessive labor damages blood and energy, and indulgent desires deplete essence, resulting in emaciation and fatigue, this is called labor deafness. If one can properly maintain balance, with blood and energy harmonized, the deafness may temporarily lessen. If labor injury and wind stagnation persist, this leads to chronic deafness. </p>
<p>Moreover, if the ear is assaulted by wind pathogens and collides with qi, the resulting sound may be noisy, and one might perceive flashes before the eyes, indicating phantom sounds. If heat energy accumulates in a vacuous state and follows the channels into the ears without dispersing, resulting in pus discharge, it is known as ear pus. There is fluid between the ears; if light, it poses no harm, but if attacked by wind-heat, the fluids can coagulate, creating a blockage in the ear, leading to sudden deafness known as cerumen impaction.</p>
<p>The aforementioned conditions can be inferred from the kidney channels: wind can be superficial and abundant, heat can be surging and substantial, while a vacuous state can be thin and moist. Wind disperses, heat clears and facilitates, and a vacuous state requires nourishment. When the pathogenic qi retreats, one can then use remedies to open the ears, adjust the qi, and soothe the kidneys.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers</strong><br><strong>By Jin Dou Hanqing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ear Wind Poison</strong></p>
<p>Ear wind poison affects the heart meridian, caused by kidney energy not circulating, stagnating in the heart meridian, resulting in damage to the ear. The five types of ear ailments—ear abscess, ear fungus, ear boil, ear dampness, and ear rot—can be treated with a liver-clearing flow drink, followed by a pain-relieving descending qi decoction. If encountering ear abscess or ear fungus, first prick and rupture with a needle, then apply red jade ointment. For ear swelling and pain, drip tiger ear grass juice into the ear, and the pain will cease. For ear boils, drip strong liquor on the boil’s root to relieve it, then wash with bitter tea to counteract the alcohol poison.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Gate Boil</strong></p>
<p>Ear gate boil affects the liver meridian, with toxic energy causing blood stagnation. This is a malevolent condition and should be treated with boiled medicines.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Ear Root Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The ear root abscess affects the kidney meridian, caused by anger harming the heart, stagnating the liver meridian, and the accumulation of wind-heat leading to toxicity. It should be treated with eyebrow wind medicine, or with the Clear Liver Qi Flowing Decoction for relief.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>The sore arises near the ear and is also called a hot toxin abscess. Within five or six days, it grows resembling a beehive, and if the skin appears purple, it is hot, with sensations like being burned, causing unbearable pain, and can be punctured after ten days. If no pus is present, death may occur after eleven days. If the sore is soft and white pus is seen, it will not be fatal; if yellow pus emerges, it will not result in death. Continuous fresh blood or red pus signifies mortality. Those who cannot taste food or tell lies may also die. Between twenty days, signs of fortune or misfortune will appear. When preparing medicine, use the Qianjin Neituo Powder, adjusting as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Stone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Although similar to stone boils, stone abscesses show deep cold residing in the meridian, with blood and qi accumulating and not dispersing, hidden under the skin, and swollen to the touch like stone. This poison connects to the neck, internal decay occurs first, before breaking through the skin. If the marrow appears at the neck, it results in death. Use methods to drain pus and internally replenish with the Ten Xuan Powder, waiting until the pus is fully expelled, then supplement internally; for persistent heat, use Frankincense Heart Protection Powder, applying golden silk ointment, adding five flavors, tianhua fen, dry kudzu, maidenhair, and black plum if there is extreme thirst. At the onset, moxibustion on the affected area with moxa fire for thirty or forty times is necessary. If occurring on the forehead or face, it is untreatable. </p>
<p><strong>Jisheng Formula</strong> (Song Dynasty, Yan Yonghe)<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Ear</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the organ of the kidneys; the kidneys are where essence is stored. When kidney energy is sufficient, the vital essence rises and one can hear the five tones clearly. However, if one becomes overly fatigued and the vital essence is deficient, then external influences such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness can invade, and emotional disturbances like joy, anger, worry, and thought can cause internal injury, leading to deafness. Tinnitus, heat accumulation, along with bleeding or pus formation, can result in problems deep within the ear. If the complexion of the cheeks and temples is dark, it indicates deafness. There are cases where the lesser yang meridian is blocked and causes deafness, manifesting as a fiery sensation inside the ear. Conversely, if the greater yang meridian is blocked and causes deafness, there is fullness of energy in the ear. Generally, deafness due to energy blockage is relatively easier to treat, while deafness due to the loss of vital essence is harder to remedy with medicine. Different symptoms correspond to various treatment methods.</p>
<p>The ear reflects the state of the kidneys. The kidneys gather the essence, which flows to the ear. When kidney energy is balanced, one can hear the five tones clearly. When kidney energy is unbalanced, the ear suffers illness. Medical texts state that kidney energy connects to the ears. The heart resides in the ear; external factors like wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and heat impact the kidneys, while internal sources of distress such as worry and contemplation can create sores, resulting in deafness or swelling.</p>
<p>The six climatic factors harm the kidneys, and the seven emotions affect the heart. The method of treatment involves calming the heart and regulating energy. To ensure the energy flows smoothly and the heart is tranquil, the ear will respond with clarity. One should use a formula called &quot;Miao Xiang San,&quot; preparing it with calamus to brew a decoction to harmonize the heart&#39;s energy. Herbs like ginseng, dan, honey, and sand should be used to calm the heart. Additionally, medicines for regulating the kidneys, such as Cistanche, should be incorporated.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>The Six Books of Hejian</strong> <em>(by Liu Wansuo)</em></p>
<p><strong>Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness is considered a disease, and common physicians often treat it with harsh and aggressive remedies, claiming it is due to the deficiency of kidney water and coldness. But do they not understand the balance of yin and yang between water and fire, the cold and heat of the heart and kidneys, the flourishing and declining of nourishment and defense? It is a matter of balance: when one side rises, the other must fall. This is the principle of harmonious regulation.</p>
<p>The heart fire is inherently hot; if it is deficient, it turns cold. The kidney water is inherently cold; if it diminishes, it turns hot. If the kidney water is already low, how can it result in cold illness? The classic texts state: &quot;When the kidney water of the lesser yin is deficient, it leads to fullness in the abdomen, heaviness in the body, watery diarrhea, ulcers that ooze, pain in the lower back and hips, stiffness in the joints and knees, anxiety, weakness in the legs, lack of joy, difficulty in bowel movements, a sense of fear as if being pursued, a bitter mouth, dry tongue, swelling in the throat, dry throat and pain, heart trouble and chest pain, jaundice, bowel discomfort with blood, pain in the spine, buttocks, and back of the thighs, weakness and desire to lie down, and heat and pain in the feet.&quot; From this, it is evident that the symptoms of kidney deficiency are all signs of heat.</p>
<p>The texts further state: &quot;If one travels far and is exhausted, and encounters extreme heat and thirst, thirst will lead to the inner consumption of yang energy, which refers to the consumption of the yin energy within the stomach; water cannot withstand fire, leading to heat remaining in the kidneys.&quot; The texts also mention: &quot;Bone weakness arises from extreme heat.&quot; Moreover, it states: &quot;Kidney heat causes dark complexion and brittle teeth.&quot; Generally, individuals with a dark complexion and brittle teeth will also be thin and have overheated ears.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The principle is this: when water is deficient, fire is abundant and hot. Excess leads to harm; thus, one must regulate it. Therefore, one counteracts the blackness of water. When kidney water is weak and scarce, it cannot moisten, resulting in dryness and withering. The teeth and ears are associated with the kidneys, hence their severity. If sores or ulcers become extremely hot with no moisture, the flesh becomes dry and blackened. Thus, when water is weak, heat clearly arises; how can one then claim it is cold? </p>
<p>Hence, the &quot;Immortal Classic&quot; states that the breath corresponds to the six-character qi, which corresponds to the six energies of the three yin and three yang organs. In reality, it manifests as the fundamental transformations leading to expulsion; when weakened, it follows the path of dominance consistent with expulsion to eliminate its obstructions. The so-called six-character qi includes liver hissing, heart exhaling, fire’s sighing, spleen calling, lung&#39;s breathing, and kidney’s blowing. Thus, by blowing away the cold from the kidneys, heat is generated; and by exhaling away the heart’s heat, cold is produced. </p>
<p>It is said that in spring, one does not blow; in summer, one does not exhale; in autumn, one does not hiss; in winter, one does not breathe out; throughout the four seasons, there are constant sighs, indicating the three burners are never insufficient; if the eight seasons cannot be blown, it means the kidneys find it hard to be robust. Observing through blowing, when the cold emotions of kidney water are expelled, the yang heat surges, and one experiences blurring of vision and dizziness. Weakness gives proof of heat. How can one then reverse this and use heating medicines to nourish water? Moreover, if water is scarce, it cannot overcome fire, and taking hot medicine, would it not be damaging? The classics state to treat heat with cold—this means cooling to curb fire and to treat cold with heat—this means heating to help fire and exhaust water.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The text discusses the relationship between heat and cold in medical treatment. It states that although some may argue that heat can be treated by heat, the idea is derived from the notion that a patient&#39;s heat condition is severe and cold medicine is hard to administer; therefore, one may take heat-inducing remedies to follow the nature of the illness. Once the heat dissipates, the cold nature will emerge, leading to recovery from the heat illness.</p>
<p>It further explains that similar principles apply in the treatment of cold diseases. The text refers to the principle that cold is used to treat heat and heat to treat cold, emphasizing that these are still methods for treating heat-related conditions. The essence of treatment lies in reducing excess and nourishing deficiencies, achieving balance.</p>
<p>There is a caution against mistakenly categorizing heat as a manifestation of fire and cold as a manifestation of water, particularly in the context of kidney deficiency viewed as cold. The author warns against using cold medicine out of fear; instead, mistakenly opting for warming tonics before meals to counteract an overwhelming heat from the heart, only to take slightly cooling medicines post-meal to reduce heat. However, one might not realize that such approaches do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a disease essentially originates from heat and one consumes heating medicines, the condition can worsen despite later attempts to consume cold medicines. The wrong approach can lead to further complications. It highlights that the proper method does not support the idea of nurturing water to dampen fire.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it emphasizes that the balance of the five internal organs is the goal. This principle stands irrespective of the specific dynamics of each organ&#39;s functions and imbalances. Ultimately, the discussion revolves around the fluctuations in yang energy and the idea that if the lower body is cold, it indicates a deficiency of fire energy in the lower region; thus, heating remedies are used not to support kidney water, as deficient water cannot turn into cold.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Diseases arise not solely from the decline or changes in the internal organs but rather from the harm inflicted by internal and external evils. Hence, they lead to illness. Generally, when treating diseases, one must identify the source. If the illness is in the upper part, treat the upper; if in the lower, treat the lower; this applies to all internal organs, channels, and collaterals. If the pathogenic energy is heat, then eliminate the heat; if it is cold, then dispel the cold; the same principle applies to the six qi. Differentiate between excess and deficiency, expel evils and nourish the right, maintain balance, and this is the way of medicine. It is unwise to see a condition characterized by heat and then apply heat remedies while claiming to nourish water to overcome heart fire. This can be seen as seeking the path nearby while looking far away, pursuing ease while seeking difficulty, and it should be cautioned against! Thus, when it is said that kidney deficiency results in cold in the lower part, it does not imply that kidney water is deficient. It is said that there are two kidneys; the classics state that beside the seventh vertebra, there is a small heart located within. Yang Shangshan annotates &quot;Tai Su&quot; stating: the human spine has twenty-one segments, with the left side of the seventh segment being the kidney and the right being the Mingmen, which refers to the small heart. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; mentions that the origin of the heart emerges from the Tai Ling, and the Tai Ling point belongs to the Hand Jueyin and is associated with the fire of the small heart. The &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; states that needling the Tai Ling point is to drain the fire originating from the small heart. Therefore, the right kidney and Mingmen correspond to the small heart, which is connected to the Hand Jueyin’s fire. The &quot;Xian Jing&quot; states: the right kidney represents the male, and the left kidney represents the female. This is because the male is associated with Yang fire and the female with Yin water. To claim that a woman&#39;s left kidney is the Mingmen is a mistake.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that the right kidney is the gate of life; for men, it stores essence, whereas for women, it connects to the womb. Can these be contrary? However, the right kidney, as the gate of life, is closely associated with the hand&#39;s Jueyin organ, thus forming a relationship with the hand&#39;s Shaoyang Sanjiao in terms of interior and exterior, sharing the same divine pulse, as seen in the right wrist. Both channels represent the fire of the sovereign and minister, hence it is called the gate of life. Therefore, the &quot;Xianjing&quot; states: the heart is the sovereign fire, and the kidney is the minister fire. This indicates that the right kidney belongs to fire and not to water; thus, a deficiency of fire in the right kidney leads to cold illness. Although the sovereign and minister are two types of fire, in terms of the theory of the five elements, they are one in heat. </p>
<p>In the theory of the five elements, there is yin within yang and yang within yin; lonely yin does not thrive and alone yang does not persist. Only when a being fully encompasses the five elements and mutually nourishes one another can there be peace. Interactions leading to overcoming and destruction signify rise and fall. Disruption and deviation from the norm give rise to disasters. Thus, when water is scarce and fire abundant, there is yang excess and yin deficiency, causing illness from heat; when there is an abundance of water and scarcity of fire, there is yin excess and yang deficiency, causing illness from cold. Hence, using heat-inducing medicines to nourish the kidney and overpower the heart fire is misguided.</p>
<p>Whether due to indulgence leading to illness or prolonged conditions resulting in sickness, it is mistakenly considered that it is due to a deficiency of the original qi causing cold illness. However, the disturbances and strains are largely transformations of yang fire, with numerous cases of over-excitement and chaotic qi resulting in heat illness. Thus, the classics mention the ailments of heat and those related to the transformations of yin and yang and the exhausting of sexual energy.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Therefore, when fever has not yet receded, and in cases of excessive drunkenness leading to rapid calamity, it is because yang heat can easily become violent. The essence of Taiyi, the true original qi, is neither yin nor yang, neither cold nor hot. Hence, the essence produces qi, and qi gives rise to spirit, with the spirit able to control its form. Thus, essence is the root of spirit and qi, and provides substance to the body. When strong, it is difficult for various pathogens to harm, but when weak, numerous diseases can easily invade. Why then does one say that original qi is deficient and becomes cold? Thus, in the elderly, qi declines, leading to many ailments such as dizziness, tinnitus, or deafness, shortness of breath, coughing, thick and sticky saliva, bitter mouth and dry tongue, difficulty in the throat, weakness in limbs, muscular atrophy, and dryness inside and outside, with constipation or urinary issues. These are all symptoms of heat due to yin deficiency and yang excess. Commonly, it is said that the elderly and weak are deficient in cold and lack heat.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Even though it is said that the manifestation of heat becomes less effective with a deficiency of water, and that the deficiency of kidney water is regarded as cold, this misunderstanding is prevalent worldwide. One must discern the interplay of yin and yang, of deficiency and excess, at the right time to avoid unwarranted suffering. One must be cautious not to recklessly use heating medicines to nourish one&#39;s true energy, for how can true energy be generated then? Thus, the &quot;Western Mountain Records&quot; states: if one consumes golden stones, there will be the danger of swift demise. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says that stone medicines cause madness, as they are born of excessive heat. If one wishes to use warming medicines for supplementation, the texts indicate that accumulated warmth leads to heat diseases; therefore, medications should not be taken recklessly. The method of nourishing true energy relies on a balanced diet, regular living habits, and avoiding undue labor to prevent harm, with a harmonious balance of yin and yang. This alone is beneficial. Although the &quot;Immortal Classics&quot; mention the consumption of elixirs, they are not suitable for everyone. Moreover, it is crucial to harmonize with substances that are neutral and non-toxic, simply to regulate one&#39;s energy.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>A true practitioner of the Dao regards internal affairs as the essence of achievement and external affairs as the means of conduct; they do not rely on elixirs while hoping to attain the Dao. Therefore, the &quot;Immortal Classics&quot; further states that if one takes elixirs without preparing the five flavors and four energies and instead focuses on a single type, over time, the internal organs will be misaligned, leading to illness. How could one mistakenly take a hot remedy and expect benefits? It is said that deafness arises from the decline of water and the fullness of fire, with heat blocking the pathways, thus obstructing the entrance to the audible. What is observed is that when one closes their ears with both hands, it resembles the sound of a drum; this is called the celestial drum. The vital energy circulates and is blocked in the ears, leading to sound within, hence the ability to hear. If there is obstruction, the celestial drum is faintly heard. If the celestial drum is inaudible, then the entrance to hearing is completely closed, resulting in deafness where nothing is heard. Thus, one method involves soaking needle, sand, and wine, applying a magnet to the ear, intending to guide the energy to unblock it. </p>
<p>If someone asks: Since deafness relates to heat, why is it that taking spicy hot things like dried scorpion, ginger, aconite, and strong liquor sometimes leads to recovery? The answer is: They aim to open the entrance and allow the stagnant energy within the ears to flow out. Therefore, in the practice of preserving health, using medicinals with effective results can be likened to hearing a symphony of joyous sounds, as yang energy opens the pathways. In treating deafness, one must tailor their approach; if the heat condition has subsided yet deafness remains, then spicy and warming remedies should be used to stimulate. If a few doses do not yield results, it should not be continued for long, as excessive heat may lead to other ailments. If deafness is associated with a hot condition, it is advisable to use cooling remedies that dispel wind and clear heat to achieve recovery. However, if the deafness is severely blocked, it becomes quite difficult to treat.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>One must be cautious not to attack too aggressively, as it may harm the vital energy. If it is not the correct illness, do not administer the remedy. Dietary principles should be followed: what is appropriate must not be taken to excess, or it will backfire against the vital energy. When the illness is gone, cease the medications. To seek health without harm is all that is needed. Therefore, regarding the treatment of serious poisons, ten methods eliminate six; for minor poisons, ten methods eliminate seven; for chronic poisons, ten methods eliminate eight; for non-poisons, ten methods eliminate nine. Nourish with grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables, and do not exceed, lest the vital energy be harmed. Practices should not be continued indefinitely, returning to the appropriate methods. Thus it is said: one must first account for seasonal influences, avoiding disturbance to the heavenly harmony. Do not have substance without emptiness, nor emptiness without substance, to prevent calamity for humankind. Do not invite evil, nor lose the proper way, which would cut off longevity. </p>
<p>Exhaustion of the Yang energy accumulates in summer, causing heat syncope, resulting in blindness and deafness. Ginseng powder serves as its remedy. </p>
<p>The ears are not singular. In terms of perception, they are associated with water; in terms of sound, with metal. In terms of channels, both the lesser Yang of the hands and feet converge here. If there are sounds from within that cannot be heard, it relates to the master; if there are sounds from outside that cannot be perceived, it relates to the channels. There are sounds like cicadas, like chiming bells, or like roaring flames, each corresponding to the channels, and one must discern between the virtual and the actual. If one assumes that deafness relates to the kidneys, what then is the treatment for the lungs? The lungs govern sound; nasal congestion pertains to the lungs. What then is the treatment for the heart? The heart governs smell. By applying this method, all begins with the reception of energy. The kidneys receive energy at the hour of Si, the heart at the hour of Hai, the liver at the hour of Shen, the lungs at the hour of Yin, and the spleen governs all four seasons. This method is the way to longevity.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus involves sound, and it is not mere imagination. The ear is the orifice of the kidneys and connects with the channels of the hand&#39;s yang, the lesser yang, and the foot&#39;s lesser yin and lesser yang. When the water is deficient and the fire is excessive, with heat rising significantly and invading its channels, it strikes the auditory organs, producing sounds corresponding to the subtle variations in the pulse. The classics say that yang rises, causing things to flourish, hence the tinnitus.</p>
<p><strong>Sound of the Ear Pipe</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is deficient and evil winds combine, one hears false sounds like the sound of an ear pipe. The gallbladder and the channels of the triple warmer emerge from the ear. The &quot;Copper Man&quot; states: needling the Guanchong point produces blood and drains the Zhigou point. The pulse is floating, large, and string-like; start with a small dose of Chaihu Decoction followed by a larger dose of Chaihu Decoction. This condition indicates an illness involving the greater yang and lesser yang, with the pre-existing condition acting as the host and the later condition as the guest.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Tinnitus and Deafness</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: Headache and tinnitus arise when the nine orifices are not functioning properly; this is generated by the intestines and stomach. When the stomach qi is deficient, the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose will all suffer. The classics further state: Yang qi, when overworked, expands; if it exhausts in summer, it leads to extreme weakness, resulting in blindness and deafness, as if the body is collapsing. Therefore, the essence of Heaven values clarity and purity, while Yang qi despises overwork. Diseases arising from the spleen and stomach are one such issue. </p>
<p>The pulse is taut, rapid, and deep. When one presses down, if there is a significant change, the symptom of tinnitus and deafness indicates the use of the &quot;Regulate Middle and Nourish Qi Decoction.&quot; The classics say: Headache and tinnitus arise when the nine orifices are not functioning properly; this is due to a weak stomach that cannot nourish the Hand-Taiyang Small Intestine and Hand-Yangming Large Intestine, leading to these symptoms. However, it results solely from the weakness of the stomach. Thus, the sages speak broadly of the generation from the intestines and stomach. </p>
<p>Some say: Is there evidence for what you claim regarding the generation from the intestines and stomach? I respond: The classics state that when the spleen is insufficient, it causes the nine orifices to be blocked, suggesting the spleen is a dead yin that receives the Yang qi of the stomach. It is able to elevate the qi of food and fluids to the lungs, filling the skin and dispersing into the four organs. Now, if the spleen cannot receive and transport qi to the organs, this leads to the mentioned symptoms. This is called the spleen deficiency causing the nine orifices to be closed. Although it is said to be a spleen deficiency, it is also caused by the inadequacy of the stomach.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The ears are associated with the kidneys and serve the function of the lungs.</p>
<p>The ears connect to the upper airflow and are the orifice of the kidneys, serving the function of the lungs. The lungs are said to thrive within the offspring, which is the abode of the kidneys, thus enabling hearing sounds. Therefore, when essence is depleted, deafness occurs. This indicates that clear energy is received from the heavens, while exhaustion of the heart and depletion of the kidneys allow pathogens to enter.</p>
<p>Deafness is primarily attributed to heat. In cases of greater heat in the Shaoyang and Jueyin, one should use remedies like the opening phlegm dispersant, the Wind-Heat Tongsheng Powder, and the Rolling Phlegm Pills. For deafness following a severe illness, one should use the Four Substance Decoction to lower fire. </p>
<p>Deafness caused by Yin deficiency and active fire should also be treated with the Four Substance Decoction. </p>
<p>If deafness is due to stagnation, use the Tongsheng Powder refined with Da Huang wine, then stir-fry with wine three times before adding other herbs to be stir-fried with wine. For deafness, the use of Longhui Pills is essential, along with the Four Substance Decoction to nourish Yin.</p>
<p>For damp phlegm, one may use Shenxiong Pills or Betel Nut Pills.</p>
<p>Tinnitus </p>
<p>Tinnitus caused by alcohol repression requires a large dose of Tongsheng Powder, supplemented with Zhiqiao, Chaihu, Da Huang, Gancao, Nanzheng, Jiegeng, Qingpi, and Jingjie; if it does not resolve, the wonderful Four Substance Decoction should be applied. </p>
<p>For tinnitus, the use of Longhui Pills is essential and should be taken after meals.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>To treat a solidified condition in the body, use betel nut and Shenxiong pills. A roaring sound in the ears indicates a deficiency in Yin or may also suggest a blockage of Qi; this is often due to heat causing the disturbance, leading to ringing in the ears.</p>
<p>For swelling and pain in the ears, a mixture of Qianghuo, Jingjie, and Fangfeng with wine-processed Dahuang and Huangqin, combined with a little musk, should be taken. If there is dampness, use dried alum for blowing.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Huangdi Acupuncture Classic,&quot; if the essence is depleted, it results in deafness. The kidneys are the root of the foot&#39;s Lesser Yin channel and store essence. They connect to the ears, which are where the main channels accumulate. When essence and Qi harmonize, the kidneys are robust, allowing one to hear the five tones. However, fatigue can injure Qi and blood, and together with wind and cold, can damage the kidneys, leading to essence depletion and subsequent deafness. The five organs, six viscera, and twelve meridians connect to the ears. When the Yin-Yang energies are disturbed, it leads to a condition known as &quot;Jue Qi&quot; that causes disturbances in the ear channels, resulting in deafness. If the deafness is due to kidney essence depletion, the complexion around the cheeks and cheekbones will appear dark. If the pulse of the Lesser Yang pathway is reversed, leading to deafness, you will observe a bright, shining sensation within the ears. If it’s the Taiyang pathway causing deafness, there will be fullness in the ear; in such cases, treatment with Shujing Powder is appropriate.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Sudden Deafness</p>
<p>Sudden deafness is caused by a deficiency of kidney qi, which allows wind evil to invade and strike the meridians. It rises through the blood vessels to the ears, where the righteous qi clashes with the evil qi, resulting in sudden deafness. It should be treated with cattail pollen ointment.</p>
<p>Ear Inflammation</p>
<p>The ear is where the meridians converge and is connected to the kidney qi, belonging to the foot&#39;s lesser yin channel. If labor exhausts the qi and blood, and the heat qi enters through the deficiency in the meridian, the evil follows the blood and qi to the ear. When heat accumulates, it generates pus, which is termed ear inflammation.</p>
<p>Ear Sores</p>
<p>Ear sores arise because the foot&#39;s lesser yin channel connects to the ear. If this channel is deficient, wind and heat can invade, following the pulse into the ear. The clash between qi and blood causes sores to form within the ear.</p>

<p>Tinnitus</p>
<p>Tinnitus is primarily due to insufficient kidney essence and the movement of fire from yin deficiency. In cases of phlegm and fire, the ringing is pronounced; in cases of kidney deficiency, it is faint. Treatment should include kidney tonifying pills, astragalus pills, restorative pills, kidney nourishing and qi promoting decoction, or six-ingredient pill with rehmannia.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Efficacy of Excellent Formulas</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Tinnitus and Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness is associated with the Lesser Yin of the foot; the kidneys reside in the ears. The essence, governed by the kidneys, is essential; when the essence and vitality are harmonized and the kidney energy is sufficient, the ears will naturally be clear. Moreover, the causes of deafness are varied. There are those who suffer from exhaustion of vital energy and blood, where wind becomes combined with heat, leading to the essence’s depletion and resulting in fatigue and deafness; those who suffer from wind-induced deafness; and those whose labor has led to damage and deafness. The twelve meridians connect to the ears, and when these channels intersect adequately, the organ energies may rise in reverse, causing blockage that enters the ears, resulting in a condition known as wind deafness. </p>
<p>The ears are attached to the primary vessels; when the pulse is weak and wind evil invades, the wind enters the ears, obstructing the channel energies, causing wind deafness. Labor exhausts the blood and energies, and unrestrained desires consume the vital essence, leading to weakness and fatigue, producing symptoms of labor-induced deafness. Some individuals are adept at maintaining their health; their energies and blood remain balanced, and without excessive exertion, their condition gradually improves. Others fail to avoid exertion, and damage to their essence and spirit from labor and wind stagnation leads to persistent deafness. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases where wind evil comes into contact with the ears, clashing with the energies, resulting in a clamor of sounds, with the eyes possibly seeing flashes as a manifestation of phantom sounds. When there is hot energy invading through a weakness, entering the ears with the pulse, if heat accumulates without dispersing, it leads to a condition termed “ear pus.” Common practitioners often use harsh, drying, and heating medicines to address this issue, but this may frequently result from the deficiency of kidney water and the presence of cold. The heart fire is inherently hot; when deficient, it turns cold; the kidney water is inherently cold; when weakened, it can become hot.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>When kidney qi is insufficient, how can it lead to illness? Therefore, one method involves soaking needle sand in wine for a day until evening, then taking out the needle sand and holding the wine in the mouth. Use a piece of magnet wrapped in cotton to block the ears, placing it on the left ear for the left side and the right ear for the right side, to guide the qi and promote its flow. </p>
<p>Someone asked, since deafness is caused by heat, how can taking hot substances like dry scorpion, ginger, prepared aconite, or strong wine sometimes lead to improvement? The answer is that these are used to open the source and relieve the obstruction in the ears. </p>
<p>In treating deafness, one must adapt to the appropriate methods. If the heat signs have diminished but the deafness persists, one should use spicy and warming medicinals to disperse it, stopping immediately when improvement occurs and avoiding prolonged use, lest excessive heat lead to other illnesses. If deafness is accompanied by heat signs, it is advisable to use methods to dispel wind and clear heat, thus resolving the blockage and achieving recovery. </p>
<p>However, if deafness is extremely severe, it can be very difficult to treat. Care must be taken not to attack it too aggressively, as it may harm the vital qi. If it is not the appropriate condition, do not take the medicine. The same principle applies to diet; moderation is crucial, as excess can damage the vital qi. Once the illness is resolved, discontinue the medicine. To seek health is merely to avoid harm. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said that the elderly tend to be weak and often sick, experiencing symptoms like dizziness, tinnitus, or respiratory difficulties. These are all signs of excess yang and deficiency of yin. The common saying is that the old and weak are deficient, cold, and without heat. Even if heat signs are present, it is often said that insufficient kidney water cannot withstand excessive fire, implying that deficient kidney water leads to coldness. This reflects the misunderstanding prevalent in society.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise: Ear Disease</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: The kidneys are the organs of strength, and skills emanate from them. It also says: The ears are the external manifestation of the kidneys. Furthermore, it says: The kidneys are connected to the ears. It is well known that the kidneys are a water organ. The heavens produce water, thus at the beginning of life, there are two kidneys formed, with one hidden yin within, and there is also the fire of vitality residing in the gate of life. This vital fire often carries the momentum of the sovereign fire, thereby overpowering what cannot be defeated, as the text states, &quot;one water cannot overcome two fires.&quot; This condition may arise from excessive desires, overexertion, or after middle age, following a severe illness; when kidney water depletes, the yin fire flares up, resulting in constant ear itch and ringing. Sometimes it resembles the noise of cicadas, at other times like the sound of bells and drums, which can be extremely annoying. If untreated, it may gradually lead to senility, which is indeed lamentable! The treatment method should focus on draining the fire from the south and replenishing the water from the north; there is no one who is not unsettled by this. Qian Zhongyang said: &quot;The kidneys have nourishing but no draining; is this not profound?&quot;<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis Method</strong></p>
<p>The left pulse is strong, indicating fire rising; when both pulses are strong, it suggests phasic fire. Such a person is likely to experience nocturnal emissions and may have tinnitus or hearing loss.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</p>
<p><strong>Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The ears are the orifices of the kidneys, and all ear diseases pertain to the kidneys. Due to kidney deficiency, there may be sounds like waves or cicadas in the ears, or rapid deafness. One should use Minglong San, or chew beeswax with wine, and consume yellow wax porridge. If kidney deficiency persists and there are continuous sounds like waves or cicadas, leading to impaired hearing, it is advised to tonify the kidneys with Zhangqi and take Zhengyuan Decoction, along with Heixidan and An Shen Wan. If ear pus arises due to wind and toxins, it is called “Teng Ear.”</p>
<p><strong>Medical Summary</strong><br>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</p>
<p><strong>Eyes and Ears Receive Yang Qi for Clarity</strong></p>
<p>The human ears and eyes, like the essence of the moon, can only gain brightness with sunlight. Similarly, the ears and eyes must receive yang energy to achieve clarity. Therefore, when the yin blood of the ears and eyes is deficient, they cannot absorb yang energy, resulting in impaired sight and hearing. When the yang energy of the ears and eyes is deficient, the yin blood cannot sustain its function, leading to a loss of clarity as well. Thus, the clarity of the ears and eyes necessitates the mutual support of blood and qi to enable vision and hearing.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Ear Diseases are Related to the Kidney and Liver</strong></p>
<p>The ear, in terms of orifices, is associated with the kidney’s water. The classic text states: the kidney governs the ears; within the organs, it is the kidney, and in terms of orifices, it is the ear. It also states: the kidney&#39;s energy connects to the ear. When the kidney is harmonious, the ear is able to hear the five tones. Furthermore, it is said that if essence is depleted, deafness occurs. Therefore, Luo Qianfu suggested that with essence depletion leading to deafness, the complexion should be dark around the cheekbones. The classic text states: if the liver is deficient, the eyes cannot see and the ears cannot hear, leading to great fear. Treatment uses the Four Substance Decoction, adding additional ingredients such as Fangfeng, Qianghuo, Chaihu, Changpu, and Fushen in equal portions, boiled and taken for over twenty doses. Then use a remedy of Duorenjiang and Xie powder. If the liver is deficient, ginger is used to replenish it.</p>
<p><strong>There are Four Causes of Deafness</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is: dampness evil injures the kidneys leading to deafness in the Sanjiao. The classic text states, &quot;the greater yin resides in the springs; dampness overcomes it, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness where the sound is unclear.&quot; Treatment for this is with bitter and warming remedies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is: dryness evil injures the liver leading to deafness. The classic text states, &quot;the yearly metal is excessive; as dry air circulates, the liver wood is affected, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness where nothing can be heard.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third is: fire evil injures the lungs leading to deafness. The classic text states, &quot;the yearly fire is excessive; as summer heat circulates, the lung metal is affected, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fourth is: wind heat disturbance above leads to deafness. The classic text states, &quot;the lesser yang governs heavenly affairs; wind and heat intermix, causing chaos and boiling clouds, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness and disturbance; with the arrival of the three energies, summer heat leads to inner heat deafness, which is treated with cold remedies.&quot;<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Tinnitus and Ear Pain are Related to Wind and Heat</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The classic text states: The liver governs heaven; the wind moves through the void, causing clouds and objects to sway, leading to eye movements and ear ringing. When the three energies align, the heavens distribute their governance, and the energy rises at the right time, resulting in the people suffering from ear ringing. It also states that when the liver&#39;s energy is strong, ear ringing and dizziness occur. Furthermore, the lesser yang&#39;s influence causes ear ringing and is treated with warming herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Pain is Related to Heat</strong></p>
<p>The classic text states: When the lesser yang&#39;s energy is strong, ear pain arises, which should be treated with warming herbs.</p>
<p><strong>The Distinction Between New and Old Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness must be categorized as new or old. New deafness is often due to heat, arising from an abundance of lesser yang and yangming fire, so it is advisable to disperse wind-heat and administer remedies to resolve phlegm obstructing the channels. Old deafness is often due to deficiency, as the kidney is commonly weak, so it is advisable to nourish and simultaneously open the channels. The pulse patterns indicate that the kidney is predominant; a slow, thin pulse indicates deficiency, a floating pulse indicates heat, a large floating pulse indicates wind, a deep and thick pulse indicates air, and a rapid, solid pulse indicates heat.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>There are three types of deafness.</p>
<p>When rich flavors stimulate the stomach fire, both ears become deaf; when anger stirs the gall bladder fire, the left ear becomes deaf; when lust stimulates the heart fire, the right ear becomes deaf. Among these, anger is the most prevalent.</p>
<p>Deafness can vary due to phlegm fire, wind, dampness, Qi blockage, exhaustion, or loss of essence and Qi. </p>
<p>Phlegm fire: Caused by rich foods heating the stomach, resulting in ringing in the ears; it can progress to Qi blockage and gradual deafness with fiery tears. For this, use Er Chen Tang with Huangbo, Mutong, Bianxu, and Qumai; if caused by alcohol, employ Tongsheng San with Nnoxing, Zhikua, and Dahuang, or consider Guo Phlegm Wan.</p>
<p>Wind deafness: Elicited by wind evils entering the ear, leading to itchiness, often accompanied by headaches due to wind heat, or can be due to stagnation. Use Fangfeng Tongsheng San, first stew Dahuang with wine, then stir-fry with other herbs in wine three times before decoction. For those with wind blockage affecting clarity, use Qingshen San; for those with wind deficiency, consider Paifeng Tang, Guixiang Yin, or Qiuzhi San.</p>
<p>Damp deafness: Resulting from exposure to rain, which leads to internal swelling and pain; use Liangge San with Qianghuo and Fangfeng, prepared with wine; or apply Wuling San with Chenpi, Zhikua, Zisuan, and Shengjiang. For damp phlegm, use Shenqiung Wan. If there is blockage accompanied by dizziness, the treatment for those with excess from anger is Danggui Longhui Wan; for those weak from worry, use Miaoxiang San; for stagnation due to sadness, consider Liuqi Yinzi with Changpu; and for those with excess above and deficiency below, utilize Mijuan Jiangqi Tang with Changpu.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Deafness from Deficiency:</strong> This occurs after prolonged diarrhea or severe illness, where wind pathogens enter the ear through a weakened state and clash with the vital energy, resulting in a noisy ringing. If there are also symptoms of visual disturbances, such as seeing dark flowers, the prescription may include Siwu Decoction with additions of Rhizoma Acori and Polygala, or Shenqi Pill with additions of magnetite, medicated leaven, Cuscuta seed, and Huangbo. For those with Yang deficiency, Bamei Pill, Yishen Powder, or Magnetite Decoction are recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Deafness from Overuse:</strong> Characterized by a dull and heavy sensation, along with emaciation and weakness. This results from overexertion depleting vital energy, requiring Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Rhizoma Acori; if there is heat, add Rhizoma Zhi, Huangbo, and Poria; in cases of sexual exhaustion, Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction with Rhizoma Zhi, Huangbo or Bugu Zhi Pill should be used. If there is prolonged deafness due to a weak kidney and absolute qi deficiency leading to complete inability to hear, treatment is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Main Points:</strong> Harmonizing qi and opening the auditory orifices are essential. The kidney&#39;s water pathways influence the ears’ ability to hear, as water generates from metal. The lungs control the qi, which flows throughout the body to the ears, thereby enabling sound perception. In all cases of deafness, one should first harmonize qi and alleviate stagnation, intermittently using magnetism and Yang Kidney Pill to open the orifices. Generally, deafness is due to phlegm and fire stagnation; unless magnetism weighs down and disperses the phlegm and fire, with the use of spices like cinnamon and pepper, along with Rhizoma Acori, it remains difficult to clear the old phlegm and heat. However, this approach can also be overpowering, so after treatment, using Tong Sheng Powder for harmonization is advisable.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus is the gradual onset of deafness; when the energy is blocked, there is often no sound leading to deafness. For tinnitus caused by wind-heat, one can use Detox Decoction with raw Rehmannia and Anemarrhena, or Tong Sheng Powder. If phlegm-heat is severe, use Dang Gui Long Hui Pills. If accompanied by dampness, use Shen Xiong Pills or Qing Mu Xiang Pills. For slight ringing due to kidney deficiency, use Zi Shen Pills; for qi deficiency, take Si Jun Zi Decoction; for blood deficiency, Si Wu Decoction; for yin deficiency, use Hu Qian Pills.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Inflammation, Purulent Ear, Ear Pain</strong></p>
<p>Ear inflammation and pain are typically due to wind-heat. The ear contains oil and liquid, which can become bound by wind-heat into a mass, causing ringing or deafness. For treatment, externally apply a mixture of pig fat, earthworm, and pot coal, forming them into balls with ginger juice, the size of jujube pits, wrapped in cotton and inserted into the ear to moisten and remove impurities. In severe cases, take Chai Hu Cong Er Decoction internally. For purulent ear infection with wind-heat obstructing upward, externally use five parts dried alum, two parts each of burnt tangerine peel and rouge, and half a part of musk, ground into powder to blow into the ear; for severe cases, take Xi Jiao Yin Zi internally. For pain that feels like insects crawling, it is due to excessive wind; if it is dry pain, this may indicate wind-heat or deficiency fire; if there is blood and water, it indicates wind-dampness. Externally, use burnt snake skin powder, or blowing in dried alum powder can also work; for severe pain, use Wu Yu, Aconite tips, and rhubarb to grind into powder to apply to the feet; in severe cases, take Dong Yuan Shu Nian Zi Decoction internally.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the orifice of the kidneys, and its diseases can be classified into several types: there are those who are deaf due to wind obstruction, those who suffer deafness from laborious exertion, those who are deaf from heat and pathogens entering the ear, and those who have purulent ear conditions resulting from wind and heat obstructing bodily fluids, causing sudden deafness and a buzzing sensation. Additionally, there are people who are deaf in the left ear, those deaf in the right ear, and those deaf in both ears; it is essential to distinguish these for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods</strong><br>For those deaf in the left ear, excessive anger stirs the lesser yang gallbladder fire, so treatment begins on the left side using Longhui Pills. For those deaf in the right ear, excessive desire stimulates the greater yang bladder fire, thus treatment begins on the right side using Liuwei Dihuang Pills. For those deaf in both ears, excessive consumption of rich foods and alcohol incites the stomach fire of the foot yangming, so treatment is approached from the center using Tongsheng Powder and Guo Phlegm Pills. Notably, left ear deafness is more common among women due to their propensity for anger, while right ear deafness is more prevalent in men due to excessive desire. Those deaf in both ears often come from affluent households because of their indulgence in rich flavors. Overall, among these three, anger is the most common cause of deafness.</p>
<p>When phlegm and fire rise, causing both ears to buzz and gradually lead to deafness, it is advisable to modify the Longhui Pills, along with needles, sand wine, and Tongyong Liqi Decoction and FucHong Decoction.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Return of Health from Ten Thousand Diseases</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Gong Tingxian]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deafness and Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For left ear deafness, use Longdan Decoction. For right ear deafness, use Nourishing Yin and Rehmannia Decoction. For deafness in both ears, use Jiu Zhi Tong Sheng San and Qing Cong Hua Tan Wan. For kidney deficiency causing deafness, use Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills, adding Yuan Zhi, Chao Pu, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu, stir-fried with saltwater, which also treats deafness caused by Yin deficiency and rising fire. In cases of ear disease with kidney deficiency, the pulse is slow and wet. A floating pulse indicates wind, while a surging pulse suggests fire excess. A sinking and thick pulse indicates phlegm obstruction with heat accumulation. In cases of prolonged deafness, the focus is on kidney responsibility. In acute conditions, a floating and surging pulse should feel the same at both wrists. If both wrists pulse strongly, it indicates Yin fire surging upwards.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Ear Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Standards Synopsis Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi)</strong><br><strong>General Discourse on Tinnitus and Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus and hearing loss must be classified by their onset—whether sudden or chronic, and their nature—whether due to deficiency or excess. Sudden deafness or ringing resulting from intense anger or drunkenness is attributed to phlegm and fire, distinguishable by their severity. </p>
<p>For middle-aged individuals or those with a deficiency, or for those who experience this after illness, all are deemed deficient. It is vital to differentiate between qi (vital energy) and blood in relation to the ear. </p>
<p>Ancient prescriptions include using mouse bile, cat urine, and vine flowers to make drops for the ear; skinning almonds, adding salt, steaming, and then applying oil drops; skinning castor seeds, mixing with a jujube, mashing, and wrapping with cotton to seal the ear; hollowing garlic cloves, filling them with fried and cooked medicinal beans, and wrapping with cotton to seal; mixing realgar and medicinal beans with scallion juice and rolling in paper to seal the ear; and using Sichuan pepper, medicinal beans, calamus, and resin, formed into a tube to seal the ear. </p>
<p>Moreover, incorporating xixin (wild ginger), puhuang (cattail pollen), curcuma, and almonds into a pellet to block the ear is also noted. When adding dragon&#39;s brain and peppercorn, these are primarily warming and dispersing methods, intended for promoting and unblocking the orifices, which may yield results if the condition arises abruptly. </p>
<p>However, if the original qi is insufficient, and kidney yin is depleted, with deficient fire carrying phlegm rising and blocking the orifices leading to deafness and ringing, then even repeated applications or insertions will be powerless—as futile as ants shaking a rock.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>It is necessary to greatly replenish Qi and blood, nourish Yin and control fire, so that the great Qi rises and fills the head, ensuring that the nine orifices are unobstructed and hearing issues are eliminated. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;Kidney Qi is connected to the ears; when the ears are harmonious, one can discern the five tones.&quot; If the Kidney Qi does not flow to the ears, then the ears are disharmonious and one becomes deaf. If it can connect upward to the ears, then the ears will be harmonious and hearing will be acute. Observing this, the distinction between deficiency and excess is evident.</p>
<p>In cases of Kidney deficiency, when there is a constant sound of water or cicadas in the ears, hindering hearing, one should replenish Qi and nourish the Kidneys with Zhengyuan Decoction and Black Lead Pill, intermittently taking Anshen Pills. If there is heat, Longchi San should be used. For wind in the Kidneys causing ear ringing and a drum-like sound at night, with aching in the limbs, and a strange itching sensation in the ears as if blown by wind, Huangqi Pills are advisable.</p>
<p>The ears are known to belong to the Kidneys. However, the Shaoyang Gallbladder meridian connects to the ears; thus, when cold evil transmits to the Shaoyang, ear deafness and lateral pain occur. If women experience prolonged depression, lumps may form in front of and behind the ears; if they are overtaken by sudden anger, they may suddenly go deaf—this is due to fire invading the primary channels, not solely the Kidneys.</p>
<p>For ear deafness and ringing, there may be phlegm and heat, Qi deficiency, Yin deficiency, or Liver fire. In youth, it is mostly due to phlegm and heat, while in middle age, it is primarily Yin deficiency.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Yin Deficiency and Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>A pulse of two inches, either the left pulse is strong or the left pulse is weak and large, with a thin body and dark complexion. If accompanied by dry mouth, dry intestines, and tinnitus or deafness, the palms and soles will be warm, indicating yin deficiency. Six-Flavor Pill and Kanli Pill are indicated for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Obstruction and Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>Hearing loss that arises from irritation requires methods to unblock and disperse. One should take equal amounts of fennel, costus root, ginseng, Corydalis yanhusuo, dried tangerine peel, and sweet flag, each a penny; and five parts each of Notopterygium, silkworm, Sichuan lovage, and cicada slough, with two pennies of pangolin and half a penny of licorice ground into fine powder. Each dose is three pennies, taken with warm wine.</p>
<p><strong>Liver Fire and Hearing Loss</strong><a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The left pulse is tense, rapid, and belongs to liver fire. Such a person is likely to be easily angered, and may experience tinnitus or deafness. It is advisable to calm the liver and reduce wood; take Longdan Porridge to purge the liver. If it does not improve, use Longhui Pills.<br>              Phlegm-fire deafness</p>
<p>The right pulse is slippery and rapid, indicating phlegm-fire stagnating in the upper jiao. It is advisable to clear phlegm and reduce fire, using Erchen Decoction, Jiuqin Lian, Chaihu, Zhuhuang, or Bamboo Juice and Ginger Juice with Rolling Phlegm Pills.<br>              Qi deficiency deafness</p>
<p>The right pulse is large and weak, or moist and thin, combined with symptoms of fatigue and lack of taste, indicating qi deficiency. This is often seen in hard-working individuals or those who have suffered from illness in middle age. It is advisable to modify Yiqi Congming Decoction.<br>              Wind-heat deafness</p>
<p>If the root of the ear is swollen and painful, it corresponds to wind-heat in the upper jiao, affecting the Yangming and Shaoyang channels. One should clear the stomach and combine with cooling herbs. Ingredients include Sheng, Chai, Zhi, Qiao, Jing, Fang, Bohe, Gan, Juzi, Zhike, Jiuqin Lian, Yuanshen, Huafen, Chisha, and Shuzan, taken frequently in intervals. If the condition is severe, add wine-steamed Dahuang. If swelling subsides but discharge of pus continues, use red powder to blow into the ear. For ulcers at the ear gate, mouse glue decoction is effective.  </p>
<p>If there is sudden severe pain in the ear as if a bug is moving inside, or if there is blood or watery discharge, or intolerable dry pain, burn snake skin and blow into the ear with a goose feather tube to stop the pain immediately. After a serious illness or overexertion leading to deafness or tinnitus, one should adopt a treatment focusing on deficiency, addressing both qi and blood, nourishing yin and benefiting qi.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p>
<h3>Hearing Loss</h3>
<p>Ear discharge of pus or tinnitus, associated with wind-heat in the upper body, can be treated with a formula of Virgate Honeysuckle. The prescription includes Virgate Honeysuckle, Fresh Rehmannia, Red Peony, Sweet Chrysanthemum, Mulberry Bark, Akebia, Ophiopogon, Herba Spike, Radix Notopterygii, Honey-fried Licorice, and Red Poria, boiled with ginger and jujube for consumption. </p>
<p>Both tinnitus and hearing loss are caused by the movement of fire due to Yin deficiency; remedies such as Kidney Nourishing Pill, Tiger Hidden Pill, or Yin Nourishing Hundred Supplements Pill are suitable.</p>
<h3>Liver Fire Hearing Loss</h3>
<p>The pulse is string-like and moist or rapid, and the individual often drinks alcohol, related to wind-heat in the liver meridian. The remedy is a formula of Patchouli and Areca. Tinnitus that extends to the neck or swelling predominantly on the left side, with a stringy and rapid pulse, is indicative of liver fire, commonly seen in women, thus it is necessary to soothe the liver and reduce fire, as well as relieve depression. Medications include Bupleurum, Green Peel, Cyperus, Angelica, Gardenia, Wine-Soaked Scutellaria, Lianqiao, Rehmannia, Peony, Fritillaria, and ye jiao. If there is swelling and fever, with exterior symptoms, the primary remedy is Jingfang Baidu Powder. If a hard and swollen lump persists below the ear, exacerbated by irritability, it is related to depression, and the remedy is the Yao Jue Pill.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu]</p>
<p><strong>Six Types of Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>Various books discuss six types of deafness: Qi deafness, Fire deafness, Wind deafness, Syncope deafness, Labor deafness, and Yin deafness; additionally, there are symptoms of ear noise and purulent ears. Generally, the ear is associated with the Kidney channel of the Lesser Yin of the foot, as the Kidney connects to the ear. The Kidney governs the essence, and when the essence and Qi are in harmony, the Kidney Qi is sufficient, allowing the ear to hear clearly. However, if one overexerts and damages the Blood and Qi, leading to loss of essence and weakness of the Kidney, deafness is inevitable. Furthermore, the twelve meridians connect to the ear; when the Yin and Yang channels intersect and the organ energies flow into the ear causing syncope, this is called syncope deafness, often accompanied by dizziness. The ear is connected to the ancestral channel; if the channel is weak and Wind evil takes advantage, the Qi becomes stagnant and cannot be expressed, which is termed Wind deafness, typically leading to headaches. If labor exhausts Qi and Blood, and indulging in desires depletes essence, resulting in fatigue and muddled senses, this is Labor deafness, often accompanied by additional signs of weakness—common in those with Kidney deficiency due to excessive desires. If Phlegm Fire ascends, becoming trapped in the ear and causing ringing, along with fever entering the ear, leading to pus formation, this is termed purulent ears. Sometimes there may be fluid in the ears; when Wind and Heat strike, it hardens into a blockage, leading to sudden deafness, which is called ear noise. All the aforementioned conditions should be attributed to Kidney issues. Wind is superficial, Heat is abundant, and deficiency is weak and subtle. Treat Wind with dispersals, Heat with cleansing, Kidney deficiency with tonics, and Phlegm Fire with cooling and descending methods. Each should be treated accordingly; is there not a way to restore hearing?<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Hearing loss and tinnitus due to heat are common</p>
<p>It is often said that elderly people predominantly have deficiency and coldness rather than heat, which is a misconception of this world. In general, the elderly have declining vitality and many ailments, experiencing dizziness, tinnitus or hearing loss, shortness of breath and coughing, thick and sticky saliva, bitter mouth and dry tongue, muscle weakness and rapid pulse, and constipation. These are all signs of yin deficiency with excess yang. Therefore, the classics state: by the age of forty, the yin energy is already half, leaving only the solitary yang to flourish, which is evidenced by signs of heat. If heat-inducing medicines are administered, it only increases the fire. Hence, cooling medicines are inappropriate, and one must instead rely on warm and balanced treatments that thoroughly address the issue. </p>
<p>Hearing loss due to qi deficiency should be seen after major illnesses.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>After a serious illness, if a person becomes deaf, it is often due to Qi deficiency. If an elderly person experiences gradual hearing loss, it is also due to Qi deficiency. If the deafness is severe and accompanied by a ringing in the ears, there may also be phlegm present, and one should not use strong tonics.</p>
<p>Deafness should primarily focus on unblocking Qi and alleviating stagnation.</p>
<p>The condition of deafness arises from blocked Qi pathways and the accumulation of phlegm-fire, leading to obstruction. When using medicines to clear phlegm and reduce fire, they must also include pungent herbs to move Qi and open the orifices; this is key to the treatment method. Ancient formulas involved soaking needle sand in alcohol for a day, then removing the sand and holding the alcohol in the mouth while using a tightly wrapped magnetic stone to plug the ear: the left ear for left deafness, and the right ear for right deafness, aimed at guiding the Qi to relieve the obstruction. If strong phlegm-fire medications are used, they can harm the spleen and stomach, worsening the blockage. If one rushes to tonify Qi deficiency, it can exacerbate fire and also fail to relieve the obstruction. It is only through the previous method, using phlegm-fire medicines combined with gently warming herbs to gradually balance the treatment, that natural recovery occurs. I have seen that overzealous treatment can harm the righteous Qi and lead to other illnesses; this should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>The treatment for deafness should aim to drain from the south and tonify the north.</p>
<p>Worry and overthinking damage the heart, leading to heart deficiency and blood loss, which inevitably results in deafness and tinnitus. Excessive sexual activity damages the kidneys, resulting in kidney deficiency and depletion, which likewise results in deafness and tinnitus. The treatment should focus on draining from the south and tonifying from the north, with an emphasis on nourishing yin and reducing fire. For heart deficiency, calming the heart and smoothing Qi should be prioritized, utilizing selections like Chen Sha Miao Xiang San or Ping Bu Zhen Xin Dan. For kidney deficiency, one should benefit from essence and tonify the kidneys with Rou Cong Rong Wan.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>The symptom of tinnitus may sound like a cicada, occurring in either ear, and can often feel blocked. Many people mistakenly treat it as kidney deficiency, not realizing that it is caused by phlegm-fire rising and becoming trapped in the ears. When the obstruction is severe, it becomes blocked. In such cases, one should examine whether there has been a history of heavy drinking and rich food, which can lead to accumulation of phlegm-fire in the upper body. The treatment should focus on clearing phlegm and reducing fire. Generally, this condition arises when phlegm-fire is already present in the upper body and is aggravated by anger, causing the qi to rise, with the lesser yang fire affecting the ears. If the tinnitus is due to kidney deficiency, the sound will be less severe, and the person will often exhibit symptoms of desire, fatigue, or similar signs.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the previous condition involves blood deficiency and heat, one should use the Four Substance Decoction with added Gardenia and Bupleurum. If it is due to weak central qi, one should use the Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction. If both blood and qi are deficient, the Eight Treasure Decoction with added Bupleurum should be used. If anger leads to deafness or ringing, it pertains to excess in the liver and gallbladder channels, treated with the Small Bupleurum Decoction plus Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Gardenia. For deficiency, use the Eight Treasure Decoction with Gardenia. If the tinnitus is more pronounced in the morning, it indicates excess yang heat, requiring the Small Bupleurum Decoction with Coptis and Gardenia. If yang qi is deficient, use the Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction with Bupleurum and Gardenia. If it worsens in the afternoon, it suggests a deficiency of yin blood, treated with the Four Substance Decoction plus Atractylodes and Poria. If kidney deficiency leads to heat or if there is excessive phlegm causing thirst, the use of Rehmannia Pills is essential. It is stated: headache and tinnitus arise from the nine orifices not functioning properly, which is caused by issues with the intestines and stomach. If the spleen and stomach are deficient, the eyes and ears may also be affected.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Ear Sores</strong></p>
<p>Ear sores are associated with the hand Shaoyang Sanjiao channel or the foot Jueyin Liver channel, caused by blood deficiency with wind-heat, or dryness and wind-heat of the Liver channel, or deficiency fire of the Kidney channel. If there are symptoms of heat and burning pain, it belongs to Shaoyang and Jueyin wind-heat, treated with Chaihu Zhizi San. If there is internal heat with itching and pain, it relates to the wind-heat of the Liver channel, treated with Xiao Chaihu Tang plus Shan Zhi and Chuan Xiong. If there is internal heat with dryness of the mouth, it pertains to deficient fire of the Kidney channel, treated with Jia Wei Di Huang Wan; if ineffective, use Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan. Other treatments should be determined according to the specific symptoms.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the orifice of the kidneys, governing the Lesser Yin of the feet. Among the twelve meridians in the human body, all but the Taiyang of the feet and the Jueyin of the hands connect with the ear. Therefore, in treating ear conditions, the kidneys are the primary focus. Some say that the heart also opens to the ear; why is this? This is because the heart’s orifice is originally in the tongue, and since the tongue has no openings, it is hence reliant on the ear. Thus, the kidney is the master of the ear orifice, while the heart is merely a guest. The five organs correspond to the five orifices, classified in terms of yin and yang. The kidneys and liver belong to yin, hence the ear and eyes are governed by yin essence; while the heart, spleen, and lungs belong to yang, hence the mouth, nose, and tongue are governed by yang essence. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: kidney energy connects to the ear, and when the kidney is harmonious, one can hear the five tones. If the five organs are not harmonious, the seven orifices remain blocked. Thus, any one meridian or channel whose essence enters the ear is enough to disrupt its clarity and lead to deafness. This refers to sudden deafness. However, for chronic deafness, there is also a distinction in the essence and energy of the kidneys. The left kidney governs yin and essence, while the right kidney governs yang and qi. If essence is insufficient but qi is abundant, the deafness is of a deficient nature. If an individual is thin and dark in color, with strong muscles and bones, this indicates an excess of both essence and energy, resulting in closure and blockage, hence the deafness is of a solid nature, which may signal longevity.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Both conditions arise from innate endowments and do not require treatment. There are also sudden cases of deafness; the texts say that those who do not understand the harmony of the seven losses and eight benefits face premature decline. If one is under fifty years old and has become heavy and less perceptive of hearing and sight, that is frightening. If there is deafness accompanied by dark facial complexion, it indicates exhaustion of the essence and kidney. One should use An Shen Wan, Ba Wei Wan, Cong Rong Wan, or Shu Yu Wan, selecting according to the situation. If there is kidney deficiency and excessive fire, with a flushed face, dry mouth, and phlegm indicating internal heat, Liu Wei Wan is to be used. This discusses cases of yin deficiency. As for yang deficiency, there can also be hearing loss. The texts say that clear yang emerges from the upper orifices. The energy of the stomach is the clear and source energy, the energy of spring ascent, sharing the same origin yet different names. Nowadays, people are burdened by diet and fatigue, leading to a deficiency in spleen and stomach energy, which cannot rise and flows down to the kidneys and liver. Thus, the yang energy becomes obstructed, and the earthly energy impedes clarity, causing detrimental effects on the orifices, leading to unclear hearing and vision. This yang deficiency deafness should be treated with Dong Yuan’s Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If one can nourish appropriately and achieve balance in qi and blood, the deafness will gradually lighten; if one does not know moderation and exacerbates fatigue daily, it will lead to prolonged deafness. Additionally, there are also cases of deafness caused by external pathogens due to deficiency, such as when the cold pathogen enters the Shaoyang, which requires treatment tailored for each channel.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>There are also conditions such as ear pain, tinnitus, itchy ears, ear discharge, and ear sores, which should be treated according to the differentiation of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess in the Shaoyin meridian. One should not solely rely on treating fire and external pathogens. If tinnitus stops when pressed by hand or lessens slightly, it indicates deficiency; if it worsens when pressed, it indicates excess. Wang Jiezai states that if the tinnitus sounds like cicadas, occurring intermittently on one side or the other, many people mistakenly treat it as kidney deficiency, which is ineffective. They fail to realize that it arises from phlegm-heat ascending and obstructing the ear, potentially leading to more severe blockage. Those who frequently consume alcohol and rich foods often have phlegm-heat in the upper jiao, and should simply treat by clearing phlegm and descending fire. Generally, this condition often arises from pre-existing phlegm-heat in the upper body, which, when combined with anger, causes qi to rise, with the lesser yang fire being present in the ear. If the tinnitus is due to kidney deficiency, it will not be severe, and the individual will likely exhibit symptoms of excessive desires, fatigue, or weakness. Xue Li Zhai provides a detailed classification, stating that if there is blood deficiency with heat, one should use the Four Substance Decoction plus Mountain Gardenia and Bupleurum. If there is weakness of the middle qi, use the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Benefit Qi. If both blood and qi are deficient, use the Eight Treasure Decoction plus Bupleurum. If there is deafness or tinnitus caused by anger, it belongs to the liver and gallbladder meridian&#39;s qi excess, and one should use the Small Bupleurum Decoction plus Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Mountain Gardenia; if deficient, use the Eight Treasure Decoction plus Mountain Gardenia.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>If there is severe discomfort in the morning, it indicates that the Yang Qi is strong and hot; one should use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Huang Lian and Shan Zhi. If the Yang Qi is weak, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi. If the discomfort worsens in the afternoon, it suggests that the Yin Blood is deficient; use Si Wu Decoction with Bai Zhu and Fu Ling. </p>
<p>In cases of kidney deficiency with active fire, or if there is excessive phlegm causing thirst, it is necessary to use Di Huang Wan. When there is a ringing in the ears, it indicates a lack of Yin; if there is fluid leakage, it signifies depletion of the brain marrow, with soreness in the legs and frequent ear ringing, Di Huang Wan is recommended. </p>
<p>For kidney deficiency accompanied by continuous sounds in the ears, hindering hearing, it is essential to replenish Qi and nourish the kidneys, using Zheng Yuan Decoction, Yan Hei Xi Dan intermittently, along with An Shen Wan. When there is wind-related ear ringing, especially when sleeping feels tumultuous like drums, and there is pain in the limbs, along with peculiar itching and the sensation of wind in the ears, Huang Qi Wan should be employed. </p>
<p>The kidneys are the source of the veins, and the ears are their openings; when blood and Qi are insufficient, the veins become weak, allowing wind pathogens to invade the ears, causing ear ringing when Qi interacts with it. First, use Sheng Liao Wu Ling San with Zhi Qiao, Ju Hong, Zi Su, and Sheng Jiang boiled together; swallow Qing Mu Xiang Wan to disperse the pathogenic wind and descend Qi, following up with Xiong Gui Decoction for nourishment. </p>
<p>For earwax, ear ringing, and deafness due to internal stagnant blood, Chai Hu Cong Er Tang should be used. Other symptoms like ear pain, itching, swelling, and cracking should reference the discussions by Xue Shi in conjunction with these treatments.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Ear Sores</strong></p>
<p>Luo Qianfu said: Sores inside the ear are related to the Foot Shaoyin (Kidney) channel. Its energy communicates with the ear; if this channel is deficient, wind and heat can invade it, following the pulse into the ear and clashing with the qi, causing sores at the ear gate. The formula Zeng Qing San is used for treatment, and Huang Lian San can also be applicable, along with the internal administration of Shu Nian Zi Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Purulent Ear (Otitis)</strong></p>
<p>Pus in the ear is known as &quot;rong ear.&quot; Use Hong Mian San and She Xiang San; for internal use, prescribe Chai Hu Cong Er Decoction and Tong Qi San. In cases of vigorous individuals where accumulated heat attacks upward, and pus does not heal, it is inappropriate to use Hong Mian San and She Xiang San, as they may overly astringe. Three Huang San is recommended in this scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong>  [Ming Dynasty - Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Ear</strong></p>
<p>The ear belongs to the Foot Shaoyin Kidney channel. The &quot;Zhong Zang Jing&quot; states: The kidney is the dwelling of the spirit, the root of life, and externally connects to the ear. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The kidney opens in the ear; when the kidney is harmonious, it can perceive the five sounds. It further states: The kidney governs external hearing, perceiving the ear&#39;s preferences to infer its nature. Thus, if the ear appears to sit forward towards the teeth, the kidney is upright. Note: The &quot;tooth car&quot; refers to the Jia Che acupoint, located in the groove under the jaw beneath the ear. If one ear is higher, the kidney on that side is tilted; if the ear is high, the kidney is high; if the ear has a depression, the kidney is low; if the ear is firm, the kidney is firm; if the ear is thin and not firm, the kidney is fragile. The &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; states: If the ear is thin and black or white, the kidney is failing. Additionally, it is also associated with the Hand Shaoyin Heart channel.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The south is red, which connects to the heart and opens the orifices to the ears. It also mentions that the channels of the hand&#39;s shaoyin converge in the ears. Additionally, it relates to the hand taiyin lung meridian.</p>
<p>Li Dongyuan said: The ears are fundamentally governed by the kidneys, yet they are able to hear sounds because sound corresponds to metal, indicative of the presence of lung within the ears, since water and earth originate from the shen. Wang Taifu noted that the channels of the hand taiyin lung converge in the ears. When the lungs are deficient, there is insufficient qi, leading to an inability to respond to sounds, hence the condition of deafness. This also pertains to the foot jueyin liver meridian.</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: In cases of liver disease with reversed qi, deafness occurs. Zhu Danxi indicated that deafness is associated with heat, primarily involving the lesser yang and jueyin heat. It also connects with the hand and foot shaoyang sanjiao and gallbladder, as well as the hand taiyang small intestine channels.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; notes: The lesser yang roots in the qiao yin and converges in the window cage; the window cage refers to the interior. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that one yang solely howls as the lesser yang&#39;s destiny, resulting in deafness at the end. Howling refers to the sound echoing in the ears. The gallbladder and sanjiao channels both enter the ears; therefore, if qi reverses upwards, a ringing in the ears occurs. It further states that the lesser yang governs the gallbladder, its channel winding at the ribs towards the ears; thus, after three days of cold damage, if the lesser yang is affected, pain in the chest and ribs ensues alongside deafness; after nine days of a weakened lesser yang, deafness becomes minimally perceived. Additionally, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions that diseases arising from the hand taiyang lead to deafness and jaundiced eyes. This also correlates with the hand and foot yangming large intestine and stomach channels.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Headache and tinnitus arise from the dysfunction of the nine orifices, originating in the intestines and stomach. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; explains: For deafness accompanied by pain, treat the hand&#39;s Yangming; for deafness without pain, treat the foot&#39;s Shaoyang. It also says: The ears are where the ancestral channel gathers; when the stomach is empty, the ancestral channel is weak, leading to a downward flow, causing a depletion in the channels and resulting in tinnitus. Furthermore, it is linked to the Foot Taiyang Bladder channel.</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; further states: The Taiyang&#39;s concept of tinnitus arises because the Yang qi is abundant and surges upward, hence the ear ringing. It is also connected to the Hand and Foot Shaoyin Heart and Kidney, Taiyin Lung and Spleen, and the Foot Yangming Stomach channels.</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; notes that all five channels are related to the ear, with the upper channel affecting the left ear and causing illness when disturbed by pathogens. The area in front of the ear is connected to the Hand and Foot Shaoyang Sanjiao and Gallbladder, and the Foot Yangming Stomach channels.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the &quot;Su Wen,&quot; the arteries entering the area before the ear are located in the depression just in front of the ear. The movement corresponds to the hand, as it is where the qi of the hand&#39;s Shaoyang circulates. Behind the ear, it pertains to the gathering of the Hand and Foot Shaoyang Sanjiao and Gallbladder channels.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Li Dongyuan said: &quot;The Shaoyang refers to the area slanting out from the front and back of the ear.&quot; Below the ear, the curved cheek belongs to the convergence of the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder and Yangming Large Intestine Channels, and also pertains to the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine Channel. </p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: &quot;The Hand Taiyang is at the curved cheek.&quot; The front part of the curved cheek corresponds to the convergence of the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder and Yangming Large Intestine Channels, while the area about an inch in front pertains to the Hand Yangming Large Intestine Channel. The back of the curved cheek belongs to the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Channel.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; notes: &quot;The Foot Shaoyang is behind the curved cheek beneath the ear.&quot; Zhao Yide remarked: &quot;The ear is the orifice of the kidneys, governed by the Foot Shaoyin Channel. However, the heart also has its orifice in the ear. Among the twelve channels in the human body, except for the Foot Taiyang and Hand Jueyin, the other ten channels all connect to the ear. The kidneys manage the internal yin, while the heart governs the external yang; combined, they reflect the way of heaven and earth, with essence and energy interconnected everywhere. Therefore, the pure and bright energy goes upwards to the orifices, allowing the ear to receive it and attain hearing. Thus, the ear belongs to the orifices of two organs.</p>
<p>In this way, the various channels embody their yin, yang, and five elements; those that are pure and bright all ascend into this. Hence, the five sounds of Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zheng, and Yu can be distinguished from this. The classic states: &quot;Accumulation of yang is heaven; accumulation of yin is earth. Clear yang emerges from the upper orifices.&quot; If the two energies are unbalanced, then communication does not manifest, hence yang energy becomes obstructed and earth energy becomes muddled.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The blockage of Yang Qi may stem from fatigue causing Yin deficiency and Qi floating, or from Wei Qi not descending, circulating and accumulating above. It could arise from the simultaneous presence of external wind and Yang, or excessive heat, or the isolated brilliance of the fire of the Sanjiao. This results in muddiness and turbidity in the ears, possibly caused by heat accumulation in the organs, or due to great anger causing Qi to rise without descending. All these conditions are due to the disharmony of the heart&#39;s Qi; if it is deficient, it cannot govern Yang, and if it is excessive, it relies solely on the strength of Yang, cutting off Yin. The classics say: “The ultimate Yin’s deficiency leads to the cessation of the heavenly Qi.” </p>
<p>As for the invasion of Earth Qi by brightness, it may be due to unresolved sorrow causing closure of Yin Qi, which does not connect with Yang, or due to internal and external dampness obstructing the Qi, preventing it from rising or falling, thus also resulting in muddiness and turbidity in the ears, or the depletion of kidney essence. If the essence is depleted due to a heat illness, complete loss of both pulse indicators signifies death. </p>
<p>An ear condition due to disharmony of the two Qi can result in a blockage from accumulating earwax. All these issues arise from disharmony in kidney Qi; when deficient, Yin Qi is weak and cannot ascend to meet Yang, and when excessive, Yin Qi rises against Yang, rejecting it. </p>
<p>The condition of sudden deafness is not severed from the separation of Yin and Yang; the channels desire to flow but are not open. If they are struck and agitated internally, stimulating the auditory orifice, and depending on the subtlety of the Qi, various sounds like a tumultuous wind and rain may emerge. Thus, one can treat the condition by following the evil, supplementing the deficiency, and draining the excess, striving for Yin and Yang&#39;s harmony. Naturally, the clear and pure Qi will ascend to the ears, restoring hearing.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>It is said: If what you express indicates that water and fire open this orifice equally, how can the &quot;Original Disease Formulas&quot; not be considered warming and strengthening? It is said: The heart is connected to the orifice as the tongue; since the tongue is not an orifice, the orifice is related to the ears, thus the kidneys are the master of the ear orifice, and the heart is a guest of the ear orifice. The five organs open their orifices to the face, distinguishing between yin essence and yang qi. The kidneys and liver reside in yin, hence the ear and eye orifices are governed by yin essence; the heart, lungs, and spleen reside in yang, hence the mouth, tongue, and nose orifices are governed by yang qi. Therefore, those in charge of yin essence value clarity and coolness while rejecting heat and disturbance; those in charge of yang qi value warmth while rejecting coldness and chill. The ancient elders had such discussions, believing that the ears and eyes cannot be warmed and strengthened. </p>
<p>For deafness due to wind deficiency, use solutions such as Wind-Dispelling Decoction, Cinnamon Star Powder, Lamb Kidney Soup, Fish Brain Ointment, Magnetic Stone Pill, and Ginger Scorpion Powder. </p>
<p>For deafness due to wind heat, use remedies such as Rhinoceros Horn Decoction, Peony Powder, Rhinoceros Horn Powder, and Poria Powder. </p>
<p>For ear deafness arising from depression, for mild cases, take the Returning Elixir; for severe cases, take the Nurturing Right Elixir. For all treatments of ear deafness, it is essential to regulate qi. </p>
<p>There are three types of ear deafness due to reversed qi: those related to the liver, the hand taiyang, and the shaoyang. The classics state: When liver qi is reversed, it causes headaches, deafness, and facial swelling. It further states: When the taiyang is said to be &quot;floating,&quot; it is all about qi.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Luo Qianfu said: When the hand of the Taiyang channel experiences a blockage of qi causing deafness, the symptom is fullness of air in the ear; when the hand of the Shaoyang channel experiences a blockage of qi causing deafness, the symptom is a sensation of muddiness and confusion in the ear. All of these conditions arise from reversed qi leading to deafness. The treatment methods should include the Four Substance Decoction, the Longhui Pill for reducing fire, and the Recovery and Circulation Powder to regulate qi.</p>
<p>For those with deafness accompanied by a dark complexion on the cheeks, this indicates loss of essence and kidney deficiency. Luo Qianfu states: As the classics say, loss of essence leads to deafness. The kidneys belong to the Foot Shaoyin channel and store essence while the qi flows to the ears. The ears are where the ancestral vessels converge. If essence and qi are harmonized, the kidneys are strong, and one can hear the five tones. However, if one exhausts qi and blood through overwork, combined with invasion of wind pathogens damaging the kidneys, leading to loss of essence, then deafness occurs. </p>
<p>In this regard, all five organs, six bowels, and the twelve meridians that connect to the ears have their yin and yang qi mutually interacting; when they do interact, the organ’s qi may reverse, which is termed &quot;jué&quot; (blockage). When the qi of blockage collides and enters the meridian of the ear, it leads to deafness. In the case of kidney-related deafness with loss of essence, the characteristic is a blackish hue on the cheeks. In the case of the movement of the hand in the Shaoyang meridian causing blockage and deafness, the symptom is a muddled sensation in the ear. For the hand of the Taiyang channel experiencing blockage and deafness, the symptom is deafness along with fullness of inner qi; thus, it is appropriate to use the Shao Shen San to address it. </p>
<p>The Shao Shen San, Yi Shen San, Bu Shen Wan, Cong Rong Wan, Rou Cong Rong Wan, and Sang Piao Xiao Decoction are suitable for those with kidney deficiency and cold. The Ben Shi Di Huang Decoction is suitable for those with kidney deficiency and heat.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Deafness with little energy and a dry throat indicates lung deficiency. Dongyuan states: According to the theory of organ qi, when the lungs are deficient, there is insufficient energy to breathe, leading to deafness and a dry throat. The commentary explains that the lung&#39;s meridian connects to the ears, hence the deafness. However, this explanation is inadequate. In fact, when qi is deficient, it must be cold; if excessive, both qi and blood stagnate and fail to circulate. The ears are associated with the primordial qi; if lung qi does not circulate, deafness results. It is advisable to take Shengmai San and chew down wax pills. For labor-related deafness, one should use Yiqi Congming Tang.</p>
<p>For unclear vision and head fog, use Qingshen San.</p>
<p>For obstructed qi that does not flow, use Tongqi San, and add Xuanfu to Mijuan Jiangqi Tang.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Ear Furuncle</strong></p>
<p>Some ask what it means when a furuncle grows on the auricle. It is called &quot;ear furuncle,&quot; related to the hand Shaoyang Sanjiao meridian, caused by wind and heat. After six or seven days, it gradually swells like a walnut, or takes on the shape of a honeycomb, either red or purple, hot like fire, with pain piercing the heart. If, after ten days, yellowish-white pus can be drained, the patient is likely to survive; if there is no pus, but fresh blood sometimes flows, and the patient cannot eat and shows signs of confusion and delirium, they may die. It is said that in children, if a furuncle grows beside the ear canal, it is attributed to pointing at the moon, but this may not be strictly true. Generally, wind, dampness, heat, and toxin congeal to form sores, hence it is called &quot;lunar erosion sore.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ear Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Some ask what happens when there is a toxic condition inside the ear. It is noted that conditions within the ear differ but are all due to wind and heat obstructing the foot Shaoyin and hand Shaoyang meridians. The symptoms can be classified into five types: </p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Tinnitus,&quot; also known as ear dampness, which frequently discharges yellow pus.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear wind toxin,&quot; which discharges red pus.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear entanglement,&quot; which discharges white pus.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear ulcer,&quot; associated with foul sores.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear tremor,&quot; characterized by a hollow ringing inside the ear, often discharging clear pus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though there are five types, they share a common root and none are associated with cold or heat. Conditions like ear fungus or ear hemorrhoids do not produce pus, are neither warm nor cold, and do not have swelling, but rather, there is a blockage in the ear. If these conditions persist, they can lead to deafness. Treatment involves drinks like &quot;Vitality Drink&quot; or &quot;Huanglian Detoxifying Drink.&quot; If there are alternating cold and heat symptoms, with internal and external redness and swelling, and increasing pain, it is classified as ear abscess. In such cases, &quot;Vitality Drink,&quot; combined with herbs like Shengma, Jiegeng, Zijingdan, and Wujindan, should be used. For strong patients, a single pill of gold pill can be administered. If there is severe cold and heat, with unbearable pain, it indicates a boil, which should be treated as such.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>Ear Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about an abscess that forms one inch and three tenths behind the ear, which in ancient times was said to be a sign of not needing treatment. Now, there is a person aged twenty-four, with a lump the size of a fist behind the ear, the color of flesh, and not very painful. What if he does not eat for seven days? It was replied: This is called an ear poison, not a goiter. Use garlic for moxibustion, and the Huoxiang Zhengqi Decoction with Chaihu, Jiegeng, and Shengma. After taking the Bazhensi powder, he recovers.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Root Poison</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about a nodule at the root of the ear. It was replied: This is called ear root poison, resembling a phlegm nodule, immovable upon pressing with slight pain. It pertains to the Gallbladder Meridian of the Lesser Yang and is caused by wind-heat from the Sanjiao Meridian. Use Huoxiang Zhengqi Decoction with Shengma and Chaihu, decocted in water and wine; or use Wujin San to induce sweating. For those who are strong, one pill of Jindan will cause sweating; for the old and weak, use Huangqi Neishu San and Shixuan San to assist.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Formulas Examined</h3>
<h4>On Ear Diseases</h4>
<p>The ear is responsible for hearing; if it cannot hear, it becomes deaf. A gentleman who has the responsibility of listening wisely would not allow this to happen. Thus, I examine the formulas. </p>
<p>For kidney heat, where there is pus and blood in the ear and one cannot hear human voices, the &quot;Thousand Gold Kidney Heat Decoction&quot; is the main treatment. The ear is an opening of the kidneys; therefore, when there is kidney heat, it causes ear ailments, leading to pus and bleeding, and one cannot hear. This formula uses magnetite to draw the metallic energy of the lungs down to the kidneys, allowing the kidneys to receive the maternal energy, which naturally clears the heat and improves the condition. The juices of raw rehmannia, Ophiopogon, and white peony root are used to nourish kidney yin and drain kidney heat. The green onion white parts are to guide the kidney energy upwards to the ears. The oyster is salty and cold, capable of softening hardness and breaking up stagnation. When combined with the green onion and applied to the ear, it opens the auditory passages and eliminates pus and blood. The rhizome of white atractylodes, licorice, and jujubes are ingredients that strengthen the spleen to nourish the maternal source of all, enhance earth energy, and control kidney evil. </p>
<p>For deafness due to labor, qi stagnation, wind, deficiency, toxins, prolonged conditions, and tinnitus, the &quot;Thousand Gold Kidney Tonifying Pill&quot; is the main remedy. Labor deafness occurs due to labor fire affecting the auditory passages; qi deafness results from stagnation in these passages; wind deafness arises when wind-heat obstructs the auditory pathways; deficiency deafness occurs from the exhaustion of qi and blood, leading to a lack of sensory responsiveness; toxic deafness results when pus and blood obstruct the auditory pathways; prolonged deafness ensues from illness persisting for a long time, causing evil energy to accumulate. Generally, any instance of deafness is likely accompanied by tinnitus; thus, it all relates back to the condition of tinnitus.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The sweet-flavored substances can replenish deficiency and also dispel labor: ginseng, astragalus, sheep kidney, cornel, dried rehmannia, dodder, baijie, cortex cynomorii, alisma, peony, angelica, poria, and licorice—all are sweet-tasting items capable of treating qi deficiency and fatigue-induced deafness. The pungent-flavored substances can drive away wind and also regulate qi: saposhnikovia, asarum, calamus, polygala, moutan, and dendrobium—all are pungent items able to treat wind-induced deafness. Toxic substances can open blockages and also heal chronic numbness: cnidium, cinnamon heart, fuzi, and dried ginger—all are mildly toxic items that can treat toxic and long-standing deafness.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>For thirty years, I have been deaf. I used thirty pounds of old iron, soaked in seven dou of water for three days, to extract the juice, and added it to seven dou of rice for brewing, following the usual method of making wine. After it ripens, I took one pound of magnetite, ground it into powder, and soaked it in the wine for three days. Then, I drank it to become intoxicated, wrapped the magnetite in cotton, placed it in my ear, and lay down with my head covered. When I sobered up, I removed the magnetite, and my hearing was restored. It is said that magnetite attracts iron, and this reflects the mutual influence of similar substances. The nature of metals and stones is cold, which can dispel internal heat; their heavy nature can help calm and expel qi. By brewing it in the wine, it is desired that there is no place it does not affect. After drinking the wine, placing the magnetite in the ear aims for a mutual interaction of internal and external sensations, allowing hearing to resume. </p>
<p>For treating ear pus, one can use ash from burned human hair. Each time, a small amount is blown into the ear to effect a cure. This is to dry out moisture, and it must be human hair, as it is derived from the body and thus self-sufficient. Other substances like white alum, red stone resin, and pigeon droppings can also be used as dry powders.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Ear diseases are caused by the erratic movement of liver wind in the three burners. In adults, there is a distinction between deficiency heat and excess heat; in children, there is a difference between fetal heat and fetal wind. Deficiency heat manifests as a ringing sensation in the ear, possibly accompanied by hearing loss, itching due to fluid discharge, with no swelling externally; this indicates errant movement of deficiency heat. One should treat this with Four Substance Decoction plus peony root, sweet flag, and Kidney Qi Pill. Excess heat presents as swelling in the ear root and ear canal, and can lead to alternating chills and fever, with persistent pain; it is advisable to treat this with Chai Hu Qing Gan Decoction. If there is a blockage in the ear canal causing continuous pain, one should use Gardenia Qing Gan Decoction for treatment, and externally insert a yellow line medicine beside the blocked tissue until it is resolved. For children with fetal heat, bathing or washing water entering the ear canal can also cause ear pain and pus formation; initially, there is no need to apply medicine for early stages, and if swelling occurs in the neck, one should wait for the toxin to subside naturally. If it does not heal by the end of the month, it should be treated with Hong Mian San, and all will be well.</p>
<p><strong>Insects Entering the Ear</strong></p>
<p>Insects entering the ear happen occasionally, such as flies or small worms. To remove them, place a few drops of sesame oil into the ear canal; the insect will die and can be extracted. For larger insects like centipedes that enter, heat fragrant meat near the ear; the insect will emerge due to the smell. If an insect enters in the dark at night, do not panic or shout, as this may push the insect further in. Instead, sit upright, light a lamp, and direct the light toward the ear canal; the insect, seeing the light, will come out. If there is someone else present, the insect may not come out.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>Black Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>The black carbuncle occurs within the ear canal, appearing as a black hard lump that decays and bleeds. It causes pain in the jaw and cheek. It is advisable to first use a needle to pierce it, followed by inducing sweating, while still treating it according to carbuncle guidelines.<br>— Medical Texts of the Medical Profession [Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang]</p>
<p><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>The human body has nine orifices: seven are yang orifices—namely the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth; two are yin orifices—these are the front and rear openings. When yang energy moves outward through the orifices and descends to the yin areas, symptoms such as urinary issues and abdominal sounds arise. Conversely, when yin energy moves downward through the orifices and rises to the yang areas, symptoms such as blocked ear ringing occur. </p>
<p>After the age of fifty, kidney energy gradually weakens; this often causes a reversal of yang energy. Since the kidney orifice opens to the ears and ear hearing is governed by the kidneys, which are responsible for storage and do not wish to leak externally, the liver, as the mother of wood, disperses the motherly energy outward. Thus, when thoughts and emotions cause an upsurge of fire and the yin energy reverses upwards, the ear orifice becomes blocked and unclear. Therefore, one can still hear without obstruction but may find distant sounds slightly impaired. Generally, this occurs in older individuals. </p>
<p>In contrast to deafness, which is more profound, deafness involves a membrane in the orifice that blocks external air from entering. Thus, the primary treatment is to open the orifices, with formulas containing ingredients like Acorus gramineus and musk, as well as external and internal remedies, designed specifically for this issue.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>Regarding old age, the yin energy does not naturally gather and is said to overflow from the upper orifices; no one has mentioned this principle. Instead, treatments for the hearing of the young and for dispersing energy are applied, combined with remedies for yin deficiency, resulting in almost no effectiveness. They do not realize that the yin energy reaching the upper orifices is also separated by a membrane and cannot escape outside, only producing sounds within, akin to the croaking of frogs or the buzzing of mosquitoes, incessantly reverberating. Thus, external sounds mix with internal sounds, rendering the hearing unclear. If the energy slightly does not reverse upwards, the hearing becomes somewhat clearer; if the energy does not reverse upwards at all, the hearing becomes entirely clear. If one understands this principle, there can be extraordinary results in treating the upward reversing energy of the elderly. The essence of the treatment involves using magnetism as the main focus, as it can effectively pull downwards and suppress the upward aspect of the liver&#39;s wood energy. Additionally, it employs herbs like rehmannia and tortoise shell to support yin, along with the sourness of schisandra and cornelian cherry to gather it, ensuring that the yin energy thrives in its source without ascending to disturb the yang orifices, thus remaining unobstructed. Just as ears receive sound like valleys absorbing echoes, even amidst various sounds, one can still listen carefully; how could one struggle to hear distant human voices? This is indeed the underlying truth, but those with shallow medical knowledge cannot comprehend it.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>Try to observe that when a person collects their sight, it becomes clearer, and when they return to listen, they become more astute; then one can understand that these words are not mere speculation. Although the orifices of the two kidneys open at the ears, the kidney energy rises to the ear&#39;s edge, blocked by a membrane, preventing it from exceeding the ear&#39;s boundaries. It is confined below the roots of the ears, producing faint sounds if little and loud sounds if much, to the extent that the muscles around the ear may twitch as if piercing through the outer ear; nevertheless, it cannot actually escape. If the yin energy could exit the ears and traverse the yang orifices, then yin and yang would be mixed, which contradicts the principles of the Three Powers. Thus, the function of the ears is remarkably subtle; they are empty and receptive. The external energies vary in size; when they reach the ears, they encounter no obstruction, but the internal energies resonate audibly, hence the external energies only penetrate halfway. If the fire of pent-up anger stirs, the internal energy increases, blending with the external energy; then the internal energy gradually flows downward, restoring the upper orifices to their empty and receptive state, allowing sounds to enter clearly and unobstructed.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The classical text indicates that the ailments related to the lesser yang gallbladder and the jueyin liver channels are largely due to excess heat, particularly affecting the left ear. However, the qi of the lesser yang can ascend to the orifices, with its acupoints all connecting to the crown of the head. There is no reason to conflate it with the jueyin. The Tongsheng Powder, which is used for sweating and purging, is a method for treating vigorous fire. Danxi&#39;s herbal choices are not clearly documented; however, the Rolling Phlegm Pill, particularly effective for the young, uses rhubarb, Scutellaria, and sandalwood which are not bitter but can descend qi effectively. The weight of calamine stone is somewhat analogous to the use of a magnet. Chang refrains from using this remedy because it significantly damages the spleen and stomach and depletes the vital energy within the chest. </p>
<p>As for ear ringing due to kidney deficiency, it is linked to the bladder&#39;s fire rising, where yang fire can infiltrate the orifices and cause the ringing. This is further unsupported in Danxi&#39;s claims. The Book of Changes states there is fire within water, implying that the true fire is a small point of genuine yang within the K’an. For elderly individuals, kidney water is prone to depletion, making genuine fire easier to reveal, and thus the qi within the kidneys tends to escape and is hard to gather again. One might question whether the jueyin’s offspring could assist in this. It is optimal to strengthen the water element to control the yang fire, akin to adding oil to a lamp to keep the flame small; this is indeed a good method. If there are claims about ineffective treatments for kidney deficiency, it is clear that these are generalized observations and not specifically applicable to the elderly. Gathering and securing kidney qi are fundamentally the priorities for the elderly, so would Danxi, known for his wisdom, truly engage in such discussions?<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Book of Jingyue</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jieben)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Regarding deafness, although various schools have discussed it, in my view, there are primarily five types of symptoms: Fire Closure, Qi Stagnation, Pathogenic Closure, Orifice Closure, and Deficiency Closure. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Fire Closure</strong> arises from the obstruction of the clear pathways by the fire element in the channels. Its symptoms include a sensation of roaring or heat, swelling, tightness, agitation, or warmth, potentially accompanied by redness in the face. For this condition, treatment should focus on clearing the fire, as clearing the fire will naturally resolve the closure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Qi Stagnation</strong> typically results from the rebellious flow of liver and gallbladder qi, characterized by symptoms that are neither deficient nor fiery, often stemming from anger or melancholy, leading to qi stagnation. The treatment should aim to regulate the qi, as smooth qi will relax the heart and lead to the resolution of the closure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pathogenic Closure</strong> is caused by external factors such as wind or cold affecting the body&#39;s protective mechanisms. Treatment should focus on dispersing these pathogenic influences to restore normal function.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Orifice Closure</strong> usually occurs due to trauma or injury, such as lacerations or damage from loud noises, or persistent ear issues leading to discharge and deterioration of the orifice. This condition should be addressed with methods that promote opening and restoration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these types requires a specific approach to treatment based on their underlying causes and characteristics.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Those who suffer from deafness may do so due to aging, illness, or excessive fatigue, leading to the depletion of essence and kidney deficiency, which results in gradual hearing loss. It is essential to strengthen the foundation in order to remedy this condition. </p>
<p>Generally, there are cases where the problem cannot be reached externally, and the illness resides within the channels; in contrast, some cases cannot be resolved internally, indicating a problem with the organs. Each should be treated according to its specific nature, and there will inevitably be cures. However, sudden deafness is often easier to treat, while long-lasting deafness is much more challenging to remedy.</p>
<p>The condition of deafness is generally due to obstructed qi not reaching the ears. Indeed, various pathogenic factors like fire or wind can cause qi stagnation, leading to obstruction. Anger causes qi to rebel, which also leads to obstruction. Injury to the orifices can obstruct qi, consequently resulting in closure. Weakness leads to insufficient qi circulation, and insufficient flow leads to obstruction. In general, real obstruction occurs when pathogenic factors are prevalent and qi is rebelling, while virtual obstruction occurs when qi is insufficient. However, true obstruction is rare, while virtual obstruction is common. Furthermore, any condition associated with strong pathogenic influence typically causes deafness and, if the proper qi is robust, it should not reach this point.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>Only when the vital energy is insufficient can the evil energy seize it; this is precisely where the true and the false converge, and this energy must be regarded as empty. Therefore, even when the illness manifests as deafness and closure due to real evil, it still carries the appearance of deficiency. Thus, in treating this condition, it is unwise to forcefully attack it, similar to the ancient methods that use Tongsheng San, Shen Xiong Wan, Liang Ge San, and Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan; these should not be used lightly. This is because attacking may not necessarily lead to recovery and could harm the spleen and stomach, resulting in further complications. In treating this, any fire obstruction above should be cleared and lowered; for those with yin deficiency, it should also be supplemented, as this is the treatment for yang conditions. If there is no fire evil, but only qi obstruction, one may either supplement or open up, but one must include warming and pungent remedies to facilitate passage; this is the treatment for yin conditions. Nonetheless, both approaches should be gradually adjusted, avoiding haste, to achieve the best outcomes.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>Tinnitus should be discerned between the true and the false: Generally, loud and abrupt sounds are often due to excess, while soft and gradual sounds are more likely due to deficiency. For younger individuals with heat in the body, it tends to be excess; for those in middle age with no heat, it tends to be deficiency. Drinking rich alcoholic beverages and having thick flavors often leads to phlegm and heat, indicating excess, while having a clear quality and fine pulse often points to fatigue and deficiency. Additionally, the ears are the orifice of the kidneys, where the ancestral essence converges. When the vital energy is balanced and kidney energy is sufficient, the ears and eyes are sharp; if labor exhausts the blood and energy, leading to a depletion of essence and weakness of the kidneys, deafness will inevitably result. Therefore, after middle age, many people experience tinnitus that resembles the sound of wind, rain, cicadas, or tides, which is indicative of the decline of yin and deficiency of the kidneys. The classics state: &quot;At forty, the yin energy is already half, which signifies decline.&quot; Furthermore, referring to the &quot;I Ching,&quot; its symbolism is particularly relevant. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;Kan represents the ear,&quot; suggesting that the yang of Kan dwells in the center, and the clarity of the ear resides within, hence their correspondence. Nowadays, elderly individuals often have ears that do not hear internally but sound externally, which is precisely a sign of weakened kidney essence and gradually diminishing yang energy. Seeking recovery is indeed difficult, yet merely finding a way to ease the situation would be fortunate. Ultimately, proper nourishment and daily cultivation of the fundamentals are essential.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>When there is a strong fire resulting in tinnitus and ear blockage, one should carefully assess the nuances of the fire&#39;s intensity and the strength or weakness of the body, and then correspondingly clear or subdue it. For excessive fire, one should use methods such as withdrawing fuel, administering large quantities of clearing drinks, or employing formulas like Danggui Longhui Pills. For mild fire, shifting to lighter drinks is appropriate; if there is also a deficiency in yin, one should add or reduce with a Yin Decoction or Clearing Transformation Drink; if phlegm is present, a Clearing Barrier Drink should be used.</p>
<p>If there is upward-acting qi causing blockage, one should use Liu&#39;an Decoction with the addition of Xiangfu, Danpi, Houpo, and Zhi Ke. In cases where qi is reversed along with fire, the addition of Shan Zhi, Longdancao, or Tianhuafen is advisable. If there is upward qi combined with wind and cold, one should add Chuanxiong, Xixin, Suye, Changpu, Manjingzi, and Chaihu.</p>
<p>For exogenous cold damage leading to fever, headache, and unrelieved deafness, one should examine and treat according to the cold damage category, as resolving the pathogen will lead to the natural healing of the ears. However, deafness from cold damage, although classified under the Shaoyang syndrome, must arise from deficiency; thus, Zhongjing also acknowledged it as a deficiency of yang energy.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>Therefore, whenever encountering this syndrome, one must focus on nourishing the vital energy. If there are pathologies present, they should also dissipate the pathogenic factors, and one can assess the condition&#39;s progression based on the heaviness or lightness of the deafness. If the hearing gradually improves, the illness will likely recover; if the deafness worsens, the condition will certainly deteriorate. If there is complete deafness with no sound perceived at all, it indicates the essence of the kidneys has been utterly exhausted, which is an extremely ominous sign.</p>
<p>In the case of deafness due to deficiency, all twelve meridians have their respective influences, but the liver and kidneys are the most crucial. For the elderly who are weak or those with congenital Yin deficiency, it is advisable to use tonifying formulas such as &quot;Great Nourishing Yuan Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Left Return Pill,&quot; &quot;Right Return Pill,&quot; &quot;Cistanche Pill,&quot; or &quot;Decoction of Complete Nutrients&quot; to treat them. </p>
<p>If the deafness arises from excessive worry and contemplation, it is appropriate to use calming remedies like &quot;Calming the Heart Pill&quot; or &quot;Mercury and Aromatic Powder.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is Yang deficiency in the upper body, formulas such as &quot;Middle Tonifying and Qi Invigorating Decoction&quot; or &quot;Returning the Spleen Decoction&quot; should be used. Among various tonics, one may consider adding herbs like Chuanxiong, Acorus, Polygala, Asarum, Schizonepeta, or Bupleurum as needed. However, when the deficiency and blockage have persisted for a long time, recovery is difficult.</p>
<p>In cases of blockage affecting the orifices, the disease results from issues with Qi and blood, and treatment should aim to unblock these pathways.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness is a disease of the kidney meridian. In principle, it should be treated with Liuwei Dihuang Wan (Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill), adding five qian of Chaihu (Bupleurum), two liang each of Ganju (sweet chrysanthemum) and Baishao (white peony), three liang each of Danggui (angelica) and Gouqi (goji berries), and three qian of Beiwuweizi (five-flavored) as well. However, instead of this, one uses a rat&#39;s gallbladder, one piece, along with one fen each of Longchi (dragon tooth), Bingpian (borneol), Musk, and Zhushā (cinnabar), half a fen each of Ruxiang (frankincense) and Chaosha (amber). Grind them into an extremely fine powder, form into pills the size of a nut using human milk, and wrap them in silk wadding. They should not be too large and must be inserted deep into the ear until it can no longer be tolerated. After three days, remove them, and the hearing will be restored, never to be deaf again; three pills are not necessary. </p>
<p>However, acquiring the rat&#39;s gallbladder is quite difficult. One should find a large rat, first raise it in a bamboo cage, then use paper to create a box that lures it to hide inside, placing food inside so it eats. After some time, suddenly strike it on the head to kill it, and immediately obtain the gallbladder; it is located in the liver, otherwise, it cannot be acquired again. If it is dried, it can still be used; just dissolve it in water, and mix it into the medicinal powder. This method is indeed effective for those with true deafness. </p>
<p>Additionally, one can use a grain of pearl, with one fen of Longgu (dragon bone) powdered, mixed with honey to form a pill over the pearl, wrapping it in powdered cinnabar before inserting it; this is also a miraculous method. After a month, take it out and then use a dose of Liuwei Dihuang Wan to ensure that one will never be deaf again.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p>
<h3>Itchy Ears</h3>
<p>When one experiences itchiness in the ears, using a wooden splinter is not sufficient to soothe the itch. One must use an iron tool to pierce it deeply, producing a clear sound, before one can feel relief; otherwise, the itch can be unbearably intense. This is due to the fire from the kidneys and liver, which forms an iron-like substance in the ears, and cannot be treated with simple herbal remedies. I have devised a prescription: use one qian of dragon bone, one stalk of soap pod, burn them to ash while retaining their properties, three fen of borneol, and one male mouse gall. First, grind the initial ingredients into a fine powder, then mix with the mouse gall in water, and finally blend with human milk until it resembles thick paste. This mixture should be thoroughly applied into the ear canal; the itch will be overwhelming, and one must have someone hold their hands down until the itch subsides and self-healing occurs. After recovery, one may take thirty jin of Liuwei Wan.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>Hearing the sounds of ants battling in the ears is not a spirit affliction; rather, it is caused by the depletion of kidney water, further exacerbated by anger harming the liver. The prescription includes three qian each of Chai Hu, Bai Jie Zi, and Zhi Zi, along with three liang each of Shu Di, Shan Zhu Yu, and Bai Shao, one liang of Mai Dong, boiled in water for consumption. This formula contains purely tonic ingredients for nourishing the kidneys and soothing the liver. After a few days of taking it, the battling sounds will gradually fade, and one month of use will lead to recovery.</p>

<p>For long-term deafness, severe cases require three to two doses; mild cases respond with just one application: Break the shinbone of a donkey&#39;s front leg, let the marrow drip out in the sunlight, collect it in a porcelain container, and use a small amount of cotton to place it in the ear. Lie on the side and wait for the medicine to take effect. Do not use too much marrow. The white marrow is the best; yellow marrow is not suitable. </p>
<p>Another method: Take the marrow from the shinbone of a donkey&#39;s front leg, mix one part with two parts of water for ten days, then take a little clear water, mix it with the marrow, and drop a small amount into the ear.

<li>For insects in the ear: Apply axle grease to allow them to exit naturally.</li>
<li>For longstanding deafness, the recipe from &quot;The Household Treasure of Hygiene&quot; is better than Golden Transparent Pass Powder: Use a live rat, tie it down, soak it in hot soup until it dies, then break its throat to obtain the gall bladder; the reddish one is the good one. Take one piece of Chuan Wu-tou, remove the skin after frying, and two qian of Huayin Xi Xin, half qian of gallium carbonate, grind to a fine powder, mix with half a letter of musk, and blow into the ear using a goose feather quill; hold tea water in the mouth, twice daily, and see results in ten days, effectively removing the problem permanently.</li>

<li>From the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;: In the waters of Xianyi, there are many yuan turtles, which resemble turtles but have bird heads and snake tails, called spinning turtles, and their sound is like the breaking of water; wearing it prevents deafness.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Translation of the Classical Chinese text:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;The Classic of the Western Mountains: On the mountain of Fuyu, there is a tree named Wenjing, whose fruit is like a jujube and can cure deafness. </p>
<p>In the midst of Yin Mountain, there are many hawthorns, whose leaves resemble those of elm and are square-shaped, and whose fruit is like red beans; eating them can also cure deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When deafness occurs due to a sudden disturbance, the eyes and ears become unclear; use sky windows. </p>
<p>Pathogenic factors on the Yangming meridian of the hand can cause ear deafness, making one unable to hear sounds. Insert needles into the fingernail of the index finger and the thumb, removing the needle as one would with chive leaves, puncturing each once for effectiveness; if there is no immediate effect, insert into the fingernail of the middle finger where it meets the flesh for immediate effect. If there is still no response, do not insert again. If wind is generated in the ear, use the same method of puncturing several times, moving from left to right, then right to left. To alleviate ear deafness through the Yangming meridian, if not resolved, puncture the pathway leading to the front of the ear.</p>
<p>Pathogenic factors affecting the Taiyin and Shaoyin of the hands and feet are related to the Yangming meridian; these five meridians all converge in the ear, with connections to the left angle. When all five meridians become blocked, it causes the body’s qi to stir, leaving one in a state of unawareness, resembling a corpse, or some may say, a state of corpse-like stupor. Puncture the inner side of the toenail of the big toe, leaving it punctured as one would with chive leaves; then puncture the center of the foot; next, puncture the toenail of the middle toe, each once; then puncture the inner side of the thumb, as one would with chive leaves; finally, puncture the heart point of the Shaoyin where the sharp bone ends, each once, for immediate effect; if still unresolved, blow into both ears with a bamboo tube, take one inch of hair from the left angle, burn it, and drink a cup of fine wine. If one cannot drink, administer it forcefully for immediate effect.&quot;<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>Individuals with liver disease, when deficient, cannot see with their eyes or hear with their ears, are often fearful, as if someone is about to catch them. One should treat using the channels of Jueyin and Shaoyang; if the qi is rebellious, symptoms include headaches, deafness, and facial swelling, and one should draw blood.</p>
<p>For those with lung disease, if deficient, there is shortness of breath, an inability to exhale fully, deafness, and a dry throat; one should treat using the channels of Taiyin, on the foot of Shaoyang externally, and Jueyin internally to draw blood.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When there is ringing in the ears, what qi causes this? Qibo replied: The ears are where the ancestral vessels gather. Therefore, when the stomach is empty, the ancestral vessels become deficient, and if deficient, they flow downwards, leading to a deficiency in the vessels, hence the ringing in the ears. Nourish both the host and the guest; it is at the junction of the thumb&#39;s nail and flesh.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said: When there is insufficient upward qi, the ears suffer from distressing ringing; nourish it at the location below the outer ankle.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>It is also said: When the marrow sea is deficient, the brain turns and the ears ring. Carefully observe the flow and regulate the deficiency and excess. It is also said: The hand&#39;s sun channel affects the shoulder, hip, and neck, causing pain and ringing in the ears. If the pain twists the muscles, treatment lies in the moxibustion and needling based on knowledge and pain. Diseases arising from the hand&#39;s sun meridian manifest as deafness, yellowing of the eyes, and swollen cheeks. Adjust for excessive heat or cold that is deficient and sinking. In cases of febrile illness with heaviness, bone pain, deafness, and desire for sleep, target the bones with the fourth needle, using fifty-nine punctures. Bone ailments that prevent eating, with enamel-like ears deepening to green, seek the bones in the kidneys, but refrain from drawing from the earth; scholars correspond to the spleen. The &quot;Jia Yi Classic&quot; states: Hand sun counterflow causes deafness; treat the root of the issue. If there is dryness in the ears, do not apply moxibustion. </p>
<p>If there is pus in the ear canal, do not apply moxibustion. </p>
<p>For neck pain and inability to turn, with unclear vision, the wind pool controls it. Severe shoulder and back pain leading to sudden deafness, with obstructed hearing and vision, the heavenly window regulates it. In cases of fever where sweat does not emerge, resulting in ringing in the ears and deafness, the yang valley controls it. </p>
<p>Deafness and ringing in the ears are managed by the lower orifice. </p>
<p>In sudden illness with headache and body heat, muscle twitching leads to deafness; the bound bone controls it. For a headache with pain behind the ears, the completed bone regulates it.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>The condition of deafness often involves complaints of tinnitus, yet in reality, it is a form of deafness governed by the Pathway of the Fen. Tinnitus is linked to the arterial movement in front of the ear. </p>
<p>For deafness without pain, focus on the Lesser Yang at the foot; for deafness with pain, the Yangming at the hand is indicated. Tinnitus is governed by points like Baihui, Yanyan, Lusi, Tiankuang, Daling, Pianli, Qianggu, and Houxi. Ear pain with deafness is related to Shangguan, with the admonition to not pierce deeply.</p>
<p>For deafness and tinnitus, the points Xiaguan alongside Yangxi, Guanchong, Yumen, and Yanggu should be considered. If deafness and tinnitus coincide with pain in the head or jaw, the point Ermen is significant. </p>
<p>Should there be heaviness in the head and pain in the jaw, drawing to the ear, with sounds like chirping or buzzing, the Hejiao point is of relevance. </p>
<p>In cases of deafness with sounds resembling wind or frenzy in the ear, the Tinghui point should be applied. If there is an emptiness in hearing that feels as if nothing is heard, leading to a continuous noise akin to cicadas, the Tingong point should be noted, with the emphasis on the lower jaw much like a broken sound piercing through this condition.</p>
<p>For deafness without hearing, focus on the Tianshu point. If there is clamor without discernible hearing, Tiansheng is the place of focus.</p>
<p>When wind arises within the ear, leading to both tinnitus and deafness during non-hearing times, focus on the Shangyang point. For conditions of deafness and blockage within the ear, the Hegu point is to be utilized.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>Deafness with pain in both temples is managed by the point Zhongzhu. </p>
<p>When hearing is muddled and there is no sound perception, the point Waiguan is used.</p>
<p>For sudden deafness, the points Sidu are applicable. </p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Recipe&quot; states: for ear pain or deafness with a buzzing sound, use the points Shangguan, Xiaguang, Sibai, Baihui, Luxi, Yifeng, Ermen, Hanyan, Tiankuang, Yangxi, Guanchong, Yumen, and Zhongzhu. Deafness with a buzzing sound like that of cicadas can be addressed with points Tianrong, Tinghui, and Tinggong. </p>
<p>For sudden deafness, use Tianyou and Sidu. </p>
<p>For pain in front of the ear, the point Shaoshang is indicated. </p>
<p>For ear pain, use Quqi. </p>
<p>When hearing is muddled and there is total deafness, apply the points Waiguan and Huizong. For tinnitus, the points Qiangu and Houxi should be considered. Additionally, apply Pieli and Daling. </p>
<p>For ear pain radiating to the ear, with a buzzing sound where there is no hearing, consider Wangu, Yanggu, Jianzheng, Qiaoyin, and Xiaxi. </p>
<p>For wind-related deafness buzzing, utilize Shangyang, inserting a needle to a depth of one portion, leaving one breath, and moxibustion three times. Alternate sides as if eating. </p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: for deafness and tinnitus, with either pain or itchiness, or a feeling of fullness, use the point Tinghui. The acupoint is located in the depression at the front of the ear lobe, apply eight draining and suction techniques. </p>
<p>For the point Yifeng, insert the needle half an inch deep with seven draining and suction techniques; you may also use Hegu or Sanli. </p>
<p>Another method: Yifeng is located in the depression before the ear, pressing it helps draw the sensation inward. Instruct the patient to first hold twenty-four coins in their mouth while lying on their side and use needles to pierce, asking the patient to keep their mouth closed and shake their head, releasing the anger through the ear. </p>
<p>For the points Tinghui, Zhongzhu, and Linqi, use the same needle technique as previously mentioned.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>Ear buzzing and ringing can be treated at the points of Shen Shu and Tai Xi. </p>
<p>For sudden deafness, use a moxa stick on the ear with the herb Atractylodes, cut into seven parts—one end flat and the other pointed. Insert the pointed end into the ear and moxa the flat end for seven times; if the condition is severe, do it for fourteen times. When you feel heat inside the ear, it is effective. The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; says that for wind-related deafness, moxa seven times at the point Shang Xing to allow the qi to flow into the ear, which can lead to recovery. </p>
<p>For ear deafness and pain, use moxa seven times. For deafness, moxa at He Gu point seven times; or at Wai Guan, Ting Gong, Shen Shu, and Pian Li. The &quot;Treasure Mirror of Eastern Medicine&quot; states that for ear buzzing, select points such as Ye Men, Er Men, Zhong Zhu, Shang Guan, Wan Gu, Lin Qi, Yang Gu, Qian Gu, Hou Xi, Yang Xi, Pian Li, He Gu, Da Ling, Tai Xi, and Jin Men. </p>
<p>For ear deafness, use points Zhong Zhu, Wai Guan, He Liao, Ting Hui, Ting Gong, He Gu, Shang Yang, and Zhong Chong. </p>
<p>Regarding guidance, the &quot;Book of Nurturing Life&quot; suggests massaging the ear rim without limitation on the number of times. This is to strengthen kidney qi and prevent deafness. To maintain hearing strength, one should always feel full.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: Engage in deep breathing to block distractions, clench your teeth, press your nostrils tightly with two fingers, and open your eyes wide, allowing your breath to connect your ears and clear your passages. You may feel a buzzing sound inside; practice this for two or three days until your passages are open. Regularly listen with both ears in order to return to a quiet state. You can also hold your breath, closing your mouth and nostrils, and imagine the breath coming out of your ears, then draw your focus back; your ears will naturally become sharp. For ear ailments, rub the palms of your hands together fifty times, applying heat to the ear to open it, and continue this rubbing and observing for six repetitions. Symptoms will improve, and with ongoing practice, results will be evident. Use mental focus to disperse heat; for men, gather it back between the kidneys, and for women, draw it back beneath the breasts or to the ears. You can press the ear area, and if you hear a buzzing, swallow saliva to calm the energy within. </p>
<p>For ear pain, visualize fire burning the kidneys, and cleanse it with kidney water; press the ear several times to stimulate sound, swallow saliva, and breathe down until you feel at ease. For ear problems, use your mind to scatter the heat, drawing it back and storing it within the kidneys, or if something is lodged in the ear, mentally remove it. </p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jing Yue&quot; states: If the ear passages are damaged, blocked, or injured, leading to sudden deafness or persistent buzzing, gently press your fingertip against the ear opening, pushing and releasing in rhythm. This should be done several times; the air will flow, and when it does, the passage will naturally open. If these conditions occur, failing to take timely action may result in gradual blockage, ultimately leading to complete ear closure.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Danqian Xulu,&quot; Wang Wanli suffered from ear pain at that time. Wei Wenjing Gong advised him to take a potion made of blue salt and deer antler decoction. He mentioned that this medicine was not for consumption due to deficiency, and asked why one shouldn’t consider the &quot;I Ching,&quot; where &quot;Kan&quot; corresponds to the ear. The Kan water resides in the kidney, opening the orifice at the ear. In terms of emotion, it relates to fear; fear injures the kidney, hence the ear pain. The movement of Qi Yang is always evident, while the flow of Blood Yin is often hidden. Blood, like water between heaven and earth, leads to Kan being the hexagram of blood, indicating disease is already documented in the classics. In the end, after taking it, he was cured.</p>
<p>Shen Cunzhong stated: When I was an inspection official in Hebei, I suffered from red eyes for more than forty days. The black part of my eyes was darkened and developed sores, causing pain day and night. Various treatments failed to heal me. The gentleman Qiu Ge, upon seeing my condition, asked if my ears had been itchy. If they were itchy, it would indicate kidney wind. There is a formula called Si Sheng San to treat kidney wind, and it typically takes two or three doses to heal, known locally as the &quot;sacred powder.&quot; I transmitted the formula and took it as directed: one dose at noon and one before sleeping. My eyes began to hurt greatly, and I could only sleep at the second watch; upon waking, my eyes had slightly improved and were no longer painful. After taking three or four more doses, I returned to normal health. At that time, Scholar Sun Hefu was in charge and, upon hearing me, was overjoyed, saying: &quot;I now know how to treat the eyes myself.&quot; Earlier, suffering from a long-term eye ailment, I once heard Lu Jifu, a political advisor, say that after a prolonged eye illness, he healed himself by taking the Tou Bing Dan (Icing Pill). Following his recommendation, I tried taking two or three dozen doses, and my eyes were cured, leading me to realize that the Tou Bing Dan also treats kidney wind in the ears.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>&quot;The Sacred Benefit&quot; states: If someone experiences itchy ears that occur daily, it is a cause for concern. Poking at it until it bleeds may bring slight relief. This indicates kidney deficiency, leading to a floating toxin ascending, which is not easily treated by conventional methods. It is advisable to take &#39;Ice-Clear Pill&#39; and avoid alcohol and damp vegetables, chicken, and pork for at least a month for the best results; if one cannot abstain, treatment will be ineffective.</p>
<p>&quot;Notes from Ink Visitors&quot;: Creatures that can enter the ear are not just earwigs; such as wall lice, fireflies, head-banging bugs, and soap pods can also cause harm. I have a distant relative who had a bug enter his ear, convinced he would surely die, and thus squandered his family&#39;s resources over several years, leading to his financial ruin. When the bug came out, he discovered it was a head-banging bug. Another individual had an earwig enter his ear; in a peak moment of distress, he unconsciously banged his head against a pillar, causing him to bleed without realizing it, claiming the itch was unbearable. Earwigs often consume marrow and can breed in the winter. For any bug in the ear, the best remedy is to flush it out with raw oil.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: The late emperor once had a bug crawl into his ear while sleeping, causing intense pain. He took ginger and rubbed it on a cat&#39;s nose, and its urine came out. He then dripped that urine into his ear, and the bug came out, resulting in a cure. Zhang Jin, a hundred households, said to me: When there is a sore in the ear that causes periodic severe pain, one may feel as though they want to die, yet when the pain subsides, it feels the same as before, and upon diagnosing the pulse, all seems calm. I deduced it was not a sore. Suddenly, the pain arose, and I suspected a bug had entered the ear. I instructed him to turn back, quickly took the cat&#39;s urine and dripped it into the ear, which caused a stinky bug to come out, and thereafter there was no more pain. Some use hemp oil to drip in, but the bug dies and is hard to remove. Others use fried sesame to treat it, and the bug also comes out, but neither method is as quick as using cat urine.</p>
<p>Wen Xuan’s Yao Haishan had a red swollen ear root with cold and hot pains, indicating wind heat from the sanjiao. However, with pre-existing deficiency of the central qi, I added Gardenia fruit, fried Scutellaria, and Burdock seed to tonify the middle and benefit qi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A scholar, due to anger, experienced pain in the ear accompanied by fluid discharge. Using wind-dispersing medicine caused muscle spasms and pain, and limbs felt constrained. This was a result of liver fire injuring the blood. I used the Six Flavor Pill, and after several doses, he recovered.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>A scholar, Mao Shifeng, at the age of twenty, experienced water discharge or pain in his ear for over a year. His pulse was rapid and strong, especially at the left wrist. This was attributed to the deficiency heat of the liver and kidney. A dose of the modified Eight-Flavor Pill cured him.</p>
<p>A man would feel itching or experience a discharge in his ear every time he entered a room. He often probed with a silver hairpin, finding great pleasure in the coolness. This was attributed to heat in the kidney channel. He was cured with the modified Eight-Flavor Pill.</p>
<p>A woman, after a fit of anger, experienced pus discharge from both ears and pain at the temples during her menstrual cycle. Pressing on it would slightly relieve the pain, but anger caused swelling and pain in the chest, sides, and breasts, along with alternating chills and fever, frequent urination, and abdominal distension. These symptoms were due to liver fire and blood deficiency. She was first treated with two doses of the Gardenia Liver-Clearing Powder, followed by several doses of the modified Free and Easy Wanderer Powder, which alleviated all symptoms; she then fully recovered with the Middle-Away Qi-Boosting Decoction enhanced with five-flavor ingredients.</p>
<p>A woman, after her menstrual cycle, became ill with chills and fever due to anger and labor, experiencing ear pain. I considered her blood deficiency as related to her menstrual cycle and treated her with the Eight-Treasure Decoction supplemented with Bupleurum; the anger indicated liver fire, treated with the modified Free and Easy Wanderer Powder; the labor indicated qi injury, treated with the Middle-Away Qi-Boosting Decoction enhanced with gardenia, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>A woman experienced ear pain, swelling, and alternating chills and fever. Her complexion was pale yellow, but it would turn red during her menstrual cycle. I attributed this to anger damaging the liver and stagnation injuring the spleen, treating her with the modified Return to Spleen Decoction and the modified Free and Easy Wanderer Powder, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>A woman had swelling and pain in her ear, experiencing chills and fever, with a bitter taste in her mouth, ear discharge, and a hot sensation radiating to her neck, along with reduced appetite and thought. This indicated severe liver fire damaging the spleen. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added San Zhi (gardenia fruit) and Mu Dan Pi (peony root), which brought slight improvement. Then I used Jia Wei Xiao Yao San and Ba Zhen Tang, with additional Chai Hu, San Zhi, and Mu Dan Pi, to regulate and nourish the liver and spleen, resulting in full recovery.</p>
<p>A widow had pain in her ear, or exterior ear pain, or a hard lump on the side of her neck, with internal heat characterized by afternoon fevers, irregular menstruation, little saliva and phlegm, and hindered chest. I believed that repressed anger harmed her liver and spleen. In the morning, I prescribed Gui Pi Tang to relieve spleen depression and enhance spleen energy; in the evening, I used Jia Wei Xiao Yao San to clear liver fire and nourish liver blood, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>Taiqing Wei Zhuang Qu, in the winter of the year Gui Mao, had ear pain, with the left pulse being large and slippery. I said: this is due to kidney essence depletion, unable to nourish the liver wood, so it is necessary to moisten the source of transformation. He did not believe this and continued to mix other tonifying medicines. I told his son-in-law Lu Shi Ruo that if Zhuang Qu could not nourish kidney essence, he would surely not survive until spring. The following year, on the 18th day of late spring, he sought treatment again. He was lethargic and unable to speak, with pus already forming in the audiophore, and also had reduced bowel movements. Only then did he believe my words. He sought treatment but was unable to. I used Liu Wei Wan, which is a remedy, and his penis retracted, his urination decreased from ten to six or seven times, and his mind quickly regained clarity. I said: if we let the pus out, we might extend a few days for the continuation of descendants; otherwise, if the pus comes from the ear, death is imminent. Some said that if we don’t let it out, he might survive, so I excused myself and left. The next day, pus indeed came from his ear, and by the 21st day of the Jiwei Fire day, he passed away.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>In the winter of the Gui-Mao year, the assistant Jiang Shichuan had a rapid pulse at the right wrist and phlegm, with the sensation of sores in the mouth. I said: This is fire from the stomach transferring to the lungs; one should eat lightly and be careful in daily activities to combat it. In the autumn of the Jia-Chen year, his pulse was strong and rapid but lacked strength. I said: This indicates that the lung&#39;s metal is unable to nourish the kidney&#39;s water—rootless fire is rising. It is advisable to calm and nurture, supporting the source of transformation to treat it. He mentioned that his throat and ears were occasionally dry and painful, and his limbs would sometimes feel hot—indeed, it was rootless fire, without a doubt leading to his demise. Later, when meeting Liu Guxia, he confirmed: Jiang&#39;s condition was as I had assessed, and I urged him to go see him. The throat was indeed swollen and ulcerated, and the pulse was increasingly vigorous. Mistakenly thinking it to be a toxic sore, he administered bitter cold remedies. He passed away on the twenty-eighth day of late spring; it was the medicine that hastened his death; otherwise, he could have lasted until mid-summer.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>A man had swelling and pain behind his ear, with the flesh color unchanged and a weak, rapid pulse. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with the addition of Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Platycodon for four doses, and the swelling subsided. Then I used Tori Xiaodu San for several doses; the pulse became slippery and rapid, indicating that pus had formed. It was advisable to use acupuncture, but he was afraid and unwilling. Only after the pain became severe did I insert the needle, yielding about a bowl of pus, and after using the Tori medicine for over two months, he began to recover. </p>
<p>For sores that do not break, one must provoke them to burst; if they do not form pus, one must nourish to encourage formation, preventing internal damage. Pus that has formed must be punctured promptly; recovery can occur within a few days. Patients often fear the pain of needles and hesitate to use them, also worrying about injuring healthy flesh, yet they do not realize that although sores may occur in thin flesh, once pus has formed, the swelling can be over an inch high, and the skin of the sore is thick. The needle should not go deeper than two tenths of an inch. If the swelling is on the back, it can rise three to four inches, with needle insertion limited to about an inch, especially since the flesh at the affected site is already damaged—what pain is there to fear? What harm to anticipate? </p>
<p>Cowardly individuals, particularly those with bone abscesses, often wait for pus to drain naturally, leading to major rupture, and many cannot contain their vital energy and blood, ultimately leading to death.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: When a person is exhausted and experiences a swelling under the ears, chills, fever, headache, and thirst, with a large and soft pulse on the right, they should take the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction.&quot; If they mistakenly take medicines that disperse, it may lead to vomiting, which confirms the diagnosis. I used &quot;Liu Junzi Decoction&quot; and then administered &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction,&quot; resulting in recovery. Generally, internal injuries to the nourishments of the body lead to the failure to defend against wind and cold; without the energy to nourish the skin, one cannot withstand such external influences. If the stomach&#39;s qi sinks, yang fire will surge upwards, causing wheezing, fever, and a large pulse. This is insufficient evidence for an external condition; treating it as an external pathogen may lead to harmful consequences of deficiency. Dongyuan states: A large pulse on the right indicates internal injury, while a large pulse on the left indicates external invasion, and this distinction should be made accordingly.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>A woman had swelling and pain under her ear, with chills and fever. After four doses of Jingfang Baidu San, the symptoms retreated; then, with several doses of Sanfu Guojian Tang, the swelling reduced significantly. Finally, after four doses of Shenxiao Guo Luo San, she was well.</p>
<p>Another person had wind-heat in the liver channel, with swelling and pain under the ear, and a rapid floating pulse. It was treated with Bohe Dan, which resolved the issue.</p>
<p>A woman, due to anger, experienced pain and swelling under her ear. She was treated with Jingfang Baidu San, adding Lianqiao and Huangqin. After four doses, she recovered. I had previously treated a similar case where the swelling did not subside after ten days; using tonics for qi and blood along with Yan Zhi wine was effective. If there was no pus, it would resolve on its own; if there was pus, it would rupture.</p>
<p>A woman, due to anger, had painful swelling under her ear, headaches, and chills and fever. After administering Jingfang Baidu San with added Huangqin, her superficial symptoms retreated. However, she experienced reduced appetite and intermittent fever. Dongyuan noted that, despite having false heat, one should not attack too vigorously; as the heat recedes, the cold may arise. Hence, I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang with a mixture of Digupi, Xiong, Gui, Ling, Su, and Chenpi, which cured her after more than ten doses. The following spring, she had recurring firm swelling that did not rupture. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with additional Xiangfu, Chaihu, Digupi, and Jiegeng, continuing for six or seven doses. As a result of prolonged treatment, she became increasingly weakened and was also administered Liuqi Yin. She then experienced night sweats, fever, dry mouth, and reduced appetite. By autumn, she sought further consultation, presenting severe qi and blood deficiency. I declined to treat her, and she eventually passed away.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>When a person becomes angry, they may experience swelling under the ear or pain in the side. Using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Qingpi, Honghua, and Taoren can bring recovery.</p>
<p>A woman who is quick to anger often has swelling and pain under the ear, with alternating chills and fever, and tightness in the liver pulse. Administering Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Qingpi, Burdock Seed, Jingjue, and Fangfeng can alleviate the chills and fever. Additionally, several doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with Siwu Decoction will reduce the swelling. Her father wanted to eliminate the root of the illness, and I advised that the liver is responsible for storing blood internally and nourishing the tendons externally. If anger causes qi to rebel, it can damage the liver, which governs the tendons, resulting in swelling and knots. She needs to manage herself to avoid further issues. Otherwise, the rebelling liver will fail to store blood, and blood deficiency makes recovery difficult. Later, she did not take precautions and developed three lumps; despite frequent treatment, they persisted and eventually led to her demise.</p>
<p>A man who had traveled far, experiencing fatigue and fever, with a weak and large pulse and swelling under the ear, suffered from labor-induced damage. He should have taken the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; to naturally reverse the heat and reduce swelling. However, he did not listen and instead took antipyretic medicines and strong dispersants, ultimately leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and death from not eating. Fatigue depletes qi, and when qi is weak, fire becomes strong, leading to fatigue and heat; this is an injury to the original qi. Danxi stated that one should replenish the physical qi and regulate the meridians, allowing wounds to resolve on their own; one should not sweat or purge. If one does not carefully assess the pulse and symptoms related to meridian illnesses but hastily uses harsh remedies, the risk of danger is significant.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>At the hairline behind the ear, there was a swelling without a head, flesh-colored with slight pain upon pressure. I believed it to be phlegm causing a soft pulse appearing intermittently. The classics state that a pulse that is rapid yet does not appear intermittently indicates a sore rather than phlegm. Zhongjing says that a weak pulse denotes a deficiency in both blood and qi, and that there is insufficient essence and form. It further states that a sinking, slow, and weak pulse should all be treated with tonics. Thus, I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, Sichuan lovage, and fried licorice to tonify, adding a little honeysuckle, white peony, and platycodon to dispel toxins. They disagreed, suggesting internal consumption to clear heat and resolve phlegm, and applying cooling medicines externally; however, they felt chilled to the bone while the affected area was very hot, leading to increasing heaviness in the head and decreasing appetite. Upon further consultation, I prescribed Four Gentlemen Decoction with added aromatic cardamom and toasted dried ginger over several doses, gradually increasing food intake. When pus formed, it was needled, and then I applied Ten Full Great Tonic Decoction minus cassia, and moxibustion with fermented soybean cake, eventually leading to recovery after over a month.</p>
<p>Luo Zongbo experienced painful swelling behind the ear with a rapid pulse. I treated him with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction enhanced with platycodon, burdock seeds, and honeysuckle over four doses, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another individual had a toxic infection over an inch behind the ear, with a solid pulse indicating a need for internal Huanglian Decoction; however, due to the severe winter, he refused cold medicines and ultimately did not recover.</p>
<p>A third individual had a toxic infection at the edge of the hair approximately an inch behind the ear, diagnosed as a sharp sore, causing burning pain and alternating chills and fevers, along with restlessness and a preference for coolness. This was due to heat stagnating in the gallbladder channel. Initially, I prescribed Shenxian Huo Ming Decoction, which reduced the intensity significantly by two-thirds. However, given the mid-winter conditions, he was wary of using cooling agents and instead took ten doses of the tonifying medicine, leading to a worsening condition; pus erupted in the ear, the throat became swollen and obstructed, and he was unable to swallow the medicine, resulting in death.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>The &quot;Meaningful Grasses&quot; states: Wang Yu originally experienced a感证 (a sensation or feeling) many years ago, and due to poor treatment, all the bodily fluids were consumed by evil heat. After more than ten years, the heat had not dissipated, and the right ear canal was often blocked. This summer, he fell ill again, enduring for more than fifty days with swelling of the face and feet, unable to sleep peacefully. Air from the ear was in contact with the outside, indicating that new heat had combined with old heat, making the situation more troublesome, therefore difficult to eliminate from the body. The physicians did not observe the binding and entangled nature of his condition, and their treatment was ineffective. As autumn deepened, with the cold of metal and water, the illness started to recede. However, while mild symptoms may retreat, severe ones cannot quickly dissipate. The swelling of the face and feet indicates that the lung&#39;s metal energy is obstructed by heat, losing its ability to descend and clear. Inability to sleep peacefully indicates that the fluids in the stomach are dry, unable to nourish the spirit. The gas striking out from the ear suggests a long-blocked canal, with air coming without sensation. Now, with the body weak and emaciated, there is no obstruction, and the gas reverses and surges upwards, making him aware of it. Although the external illness may have improved, internal adjustments through diet and medicine still occupy half of the condition. Especially focusing on two matters, the general principle is that those who become ill must understand the methods for post-illness recovery. It is necessary to realize that after falling ill, the body&#39;s vital energy has already weakened, and the evil heat within has not cleared. Thus, to restore the deficiency, the heat cannot be eliminated; and to clear the heat, the deficiency cannot be sustained. Therefore, if one aims for half to tonify deficiency and half to clear heat, it ultimately leads to confusion, lacking clear understanding. However, apart from tonifying deficiency and clearing heat, there is no other method, and one must carefully discern this. There are two methods of tonifying deficiency: one is to tonify the spleen, and the other is to tonify the stomach.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>After the weakness of the spleen and qi following malaria or dysentery, if digestion is impeded, it is advisable to tonify the spleen; after an illness like typhoid, when the stomach&#39;s fluids have been depleted for a long time and new fluids have not yet been generated, it is necessary to tonify the stomach. The differences between these two cases are as vast as the sky and the earth. There are also two methods to clear heat: in the initial stages of illness, the heat is classified as excess heat, and it is appropriate to use bitter and cold herbs to clear it; however, after a severe illness, the heat becomes deficiency heat, so sweet and cold herbs should be used to clear it. Again, the distinctions between these two are as vast as the sky and the earth. The body&#39;s vital essence resides entirely in the stomach; if the fluids are insufficient, it indicates deficiency. Generating fluids indicates tonification, so remedies that generate fluids are combined with sweet and cold herbs that drain heat, which treats the deficiency heat following an illness. Herbs such as Ophiopogon root, Rehmannia root, Moutan bark, ginseng, pear juice, and bamboo sap are all appropriate for this purpose. Zhang Zhongjing frequently used Tianshui powder to clear deficiency heat, specifically selecting talc and licorice, which embodies the principle of one sweet and one cold.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>If we use herbs like Shen, Qi, Ling, and Bai Zhu, which are meant to tonify the spleen as supplements, don’t we risk supplementing while concurrently aggravating external heat? When it comes to dietary supplements, we should focus on their essence rather than their flavor. For instance, the essence of the five grains nourishes the body, while the essence of the five vegetables enhances it. After each meal, one would feel refreshed, and the accumulated internal heat can gradually be expelled through the pores—how delightful! Many do not understand this principle; they rush to use rich and sweet flavors for supplementation. Although one may appear robust and vibrant in the moment, they fail to realize that the oily and greasy elements obstruct the meridians, preventing external heat from being released. Over time, this solidifies the internal constitution, with no prospect of release. The ancients recognized this and preferred to consume plain vegetables, knowing it would temporarily weaken the body, making it easier for pathogenic factors to exit—that should be regarded as valuable wisdom. In the case of edema linked to the spleen, using Ling and Bai Zhu is appropriate; for insomnia due to heart issues, one would use Suan Zao Ren and Fu Shen. Ultimately, the aim of tonifying deficiencies while clearing heat has not been well understood, hence the detailed discussion.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　耳聋属足少阴，肾寄窍于耳，而肾之所主者精，精气调和，肾气充足，则耳自聪矣。且耳聋所感不一，有劳伤气血，风邪乘热使精脱肾惫而聋者；有挟风而聋者；有劳损而聋者。盖十二经脉上络于耳，其诸经适有交并，则脏气逆而为厥，厥气搏入于耳为厥聋。耳者宗脉之所附，脉虚而风邪乘之，风入于耳，使经气否而不宣，为风聋。劳役伤于血气，淫欲耗其精元，瘦悴力疲，昏昏聩聩，为劳聋。或人善调养，气血和平，不妄作劳，其证渐愈。或不能谨避，劳伤精气神，风邪停滞，则为久聋之证。又有耳触风邪，与气相搏，其声嘈嘈，眼或见光为虚鸣。有热气乘虚，随脉入耳，聚热不散，脓汁出焉，为脓耳。俗医多用慓悍燥热之药制之。往往为肾水虚冷故也。夫心火本热，虚则寒矣；肾水本寒，衰则热矣。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>肾水既少，岂能反为病耶？故一法用酒浸针砂，一日至晚，去针砂将酒含口中，用磁石一块，绵裹塞耳，在左塞左，左右塞右，欲导其气而通泄也。或问曰：聋既为热，或服干蝎、生姜、附子、醇酒之类性热之物而或愈者，何也？答曰：欲以开发元府，而令耳中郁滞通泄也。凡治聋者，适其所宜。若热证退而聋不已者，当以辛热之剂发散，疾止即已，不可久服，恐热极而成他病尔。若聋有热证相兼者，宜以退风散热调之，退结散热而愈。然聋甚闷绝，亦为难已。慎不可攻之过极，反伤正气。若非其病，不可服其药。饮食同法。当所宜者，过度则反伤正气。病已即止药。欲求不病，无损而已矣。又言老人之气衰多病，头目昏眩，耳鸣或聋上气等证，此皆阳实阴虚之证也。俗言老弱为虚，冷而无热也。纵有热证，或云少水不胜多火，而反言肾水虚则为寒。此乃举世受悞之由者也。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>　　　　医学正传 【明　虞抟】</p>

<p>　　火盛而耳鸣耳闭者。当察火之微甚，及体质之强弱而清之降之。火之甚者宜抽薪饮、大分清饮、当归龙荟丸之类主之。火之微者宜徙薪饮；兼阴虚者，宜加减一阴煎、清化饮之类；兼痰者宜清膈饮主之。　　气逆而闭者，宜六安煎加香附、丹皮、厚朴、枳壳之类主之。　　气逆兼火者，宜加山栀、龙胆草、天花粉之类主之。　　气逆兼风寒者，加川芎、细辛、苏叶、菖蒲、蔓荆子、柴胡之类主之。　　伤寒外感，发热头痛不解而聋者，当于伤寒门察证治之，邪解而耳自愈也。但伤寒耳聋，虽属少阳之证，然必因虚所以有之，故仲景亦以为阳气虚也。<a id="orig-81p" href="#trans-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>是以凡遇此证，必当专顾元气，有邪者兼以散邪，且可因耳之轻重以察病之进退。若因治而聋渐轻者，其病将愈；聋渐甚者，病必日甚也。其有聋闭至极而丝毫无闻者，此其肾气已绝，最是大凶之兆。　　虚闭证，凡十二经脉皆有所主，而又惟肝肾为最。若老年衰弱及素禀阴虚之人，皆宜以大补元煎，或左归、右归丸、肉苁蓉丸，或十全大补汤之类主之。　　若忧愁思虑太过而聋者，宜平补镇心丹、辰砂妙香散之类主之。　　若阳虚于上者，宜补中益气汤、归脾汤之类，凡诸补剂中，或以川芎、石菖蒲、远志、细辛、升麻、柴胡之类，皆可随宜加用，但因虚而闭或已久者，终不易愈。　　窍闭证韭因气血之咎而病在窍也，当用法以通之。<a id="orig-82p" href="#trans-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>
<p>　　　　　耳聋</p>
<p>　　耳聋者，肾经病也。论理该用六味地黄丸，内加柴胡五钱，甘菊、白芍各二两，当归、枸杞、麦冬各三两，北五味三钱。今不用此而用鼠胆一枚，龙齿、冰片、麝香、朱砂各一分，乳香、潮脑各半分，各研为绝细末，以人乳为丸，如梧子大，外用丝绵裹之，不可太大，塞入耳之深处，至不可受而止。塞三日取出，即耳聪，永不再聋，不必三丸。但鼠胆最难得，觅一大鼠，先以竹笼养之，后以纸为匣子，引其藏身，内用果品，令其自食，久之忽然用棒椎击死，立时取胆，则胆在肝中也，否则再不可得也。干者可用，只消用水调化，俱入药末中，则一样也。实耳聋者，亦用此方神效。又方用珍珠一粒，外用龙骨末一分，以蜜调之，丸在珠上，外用丹砂为衣，绵裹塞其中即愈，神方也。一月后取出，再用六味地黄丸一料，永不再聋。<a id="orig-83p" href="#trans-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>　　　　　耳痒</p>
<p>　　耳中作痒，以木刺之，尚不足以安其痒，必以铁刀刺其底，铮铮有声，始觉快然，否则痒极欲死。此肾肝之火，结成铁底于耳中，非汤药可救。予立一方，用龙骨一钱，皂角刺一条，烧灰存性，冰片三分，雄鼠胆一枚，先将前药为末，后以鼠胆水调匀，而后以人乳再调，如厚糊一般，将此药尽抹入耳孔内，必然痒不可当，必须人执其两手，痒定而自愈矣。愈后服六味丸三十斤可也。<a id="orig-84p" href="#trans-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>　　　　　耳鸣</p>

<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Vital Energy Connecting to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>The yang energy expands when overworked, becoming depleted, and obstructs accumulation in the summer, causing people to suffer heatstroke, resulting in blindness and inability to see, and ear closure leading to incapacity to hear, feeling dazed as if the city is collapsing, and gushing continuously without stopping. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This indicates that overwork injures the yang energy. The essence of yin and yang lies in yang being dense and stable. Overwork causes the yang energy to spread outward, preventing yin from obtaining the warmth and stability of yang, thus the essence escapes and becomes depleted internally. In autumn and winter, the yang energy is stored internally, while in summer it expands outward, hence leading to increased deficiency and heatstroke. With the essence and energy being deficient, blindness occurs, preventing sight, and ear closure leads to inability to hear.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is said: If the yang cannot overcome its yin, then the energies of the five organs contend, and the nine orifices will be blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The five organs represent yin, while the nine orifices are vessels that receive the energy. If the yin is excessive and the yang cannot overcome it, then the energies of the five organs clash internally, causing the nine orifices to be obstructed.</p>
<p><strong>Jinkui&#39;s True Words Treatise</strong></p>
<p>The southern region is red, entering and connecting to the heart, opening up to the ears.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The section on diseases of the organs states: the separate energy flows to the ears to create hearing. The separate energy is governed by the heart&#39;s energy. Hence, it is said that the heart opens up to the ears.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The north brings cold; in the organs, it relates to the kidneys; in the orifices, it relates to the ears. </p>
<p><em>Note: The qi of the kidneys communicates with the ears; when the kidneys are harmonious, the ears can hear the five tones. Thus, the qi of the kidneys opens to the ears.</em> </p>
<p>At the age of fifty, a person&#39;s body becomes heavy, and the ears and eyes no longer perceive clearly. </p>
<p><em>Note: At fifty, both the essence and blood become deficient. When deficient, they cannot ascend, leading to unclear hearing and sight.</em> </p>
<p>The wise possess surplus energy; with surplus energy, the ears and eyes become perceptive. </p>
<p><em>Note: With surplus energy, the yang is abundant, hence the clarity of the ears and eyes.</em> </p>
<p>The heavens are insufficient in the northwest, therefore the northwest is considered yin; and the right ear and eye of a person are not as bright as the left. </p>
<p><em>Note: The insufficiency of the heavens in the northwest indicates a deficiency of yin among the yang. In humans, the left side represents yang, while the right side represents yin. When yin is deficient above, the right ear and eye are not as bright as the left.</em> </p>
<p>The east is yang; that which is yang gathers essence above. When it gathers essence above, the upper part thrives while the lower part becomes deficient, resulting in perceptive ears and eyes, but the hands and feet are not as agile. The west is yin; that which is yin gathers essence below. When it gathers essence below, the lower part thrives while the upper part is deficient, resulting in unclear ears and eyes but agile hands and feet. Hence, when subjected to pathogens, the affliction is more pronounced in the right if affected above, and more pronounced in the left if affected below. This is something that cannot be entirely fulfilled by the yin and yang of heaven and earth, hence pathogens reside there. </p>
<p><em>Note: This indicates that the yin and yang of heaven, earth, and the human body’s left and right sides cannot be entirely fulfilled. Therefore, humans ought to align with heaven and earth to nourish their heads and feet, and not allow pathogens to reside.</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Those afflicted with confusion and turmoil suffer from blurred vision and hearing loss. The lower portion is full while the upper portion is empty, leading to stagnation in the lesser yang and the jueyin, which may even extend to the liver.<br>[Note: The jueyin liver is connected to the eyes, and the lesser yang channel extends to the ears. When there is excess at the lower portion, the vital energy cannot ascend, resulting in blurred vision and hearing loss. The deficiency above causes movement in sight to become dim and confused, creating great disruption. This initially injures the vital energy and leads to a deficiency above, with subsequent worsening of the excess below.]</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion of the Essentials of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the lesser yang is exhausted, hearing loss occurs, and all joints become slack. Vision becomes utterly disconnected. When this disconnection happens, death is imminent in a day and a half. In death, the complexion first turns blue and white, and thereafter one passes away.<br>[Note: The channels of the lesser yang in the hands and feet trace to the ears, hence the hearing loss when the vital energy is cut off. The lesser yang governs the bones, and since all joints relate to bones, slackness in all joints occurs when the lesser yang energy is exhausted. The lesser yang channel reaches the sharp corners of the eyes, and when it is finished, it pulls at the eyes, causing startled and distorted vision. The lesser yang is associated with the kidney, which houses the will; if the connection to the eyes is severed, the will is lost first, leading to imminent death within a day and a half. The blue color represents the energy of wood, while the white color signifies the internal loss of the essence of the triple burner.] </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen is insufficient, it causes the nine orifices to become obstructed, leading to a condition known as &quot;heavy strength.&quot; The commentary states: if the five organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices will not be unblocked. Now that the energy of the spleen is insufficient, the energies of the five organs are also not harmonious. The stomach, as the Yang of the earth, has strong energy, while the spleen, as the Yin of the earth, has weak energy. When the spleen is weak and unable to take in the essential energies from food and water, the stomach&#39;s energy becomes even stronger; hence, it is called &quot;heavy strength.&quot; This means the spleen&#39;s deficiency prevents it from transporting fluids for the stomach. The stomach is strong while the spleen is weak, resulting in disharmony between the organs.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden faintness and deafness, where there is obstruction and inability to communicate internally, the internal energy must be greatly diminished. This does not arise from wind-induced conditions inside or outside; therefore, the patient is left weak. The commentary notes: faintness and deafness arise from reversed energy rising upwards, obstructing the upper orifices. When there is blocking and stagnation below, reversed energy descends, resulting in the obstruction of the lower orifices. This indicates both internal and external afflictions leading to obstructed orifices. If one does not succumb to internal worries and anger or external wind leading to severe illness or early demise, it results from physical weakness and diminished energy, causing a thin frame and delicate skin.</p>
<p>Disharmony among the five organs leads to blocking within the six hollow organs. Symptoms like headaches and tinnitus arise from the obstruction of the nine orifices, which in turn is produced by issues in the stomach and intestines. The commentary clarifies: when the energies of the five organs are long-term reversed and thus remain unharmonized, it produces blockages in the six hollow organs. When the six hollow organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices will not function properly. The interrelatedness of Yin and Yang within the organs is such that external symptoms reflect internal troubles; thus, blockages within give rise to obstructions in the orifices.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Hot Discussions</h3>
<p>For three days of the cold damage, the lesser yang is affected. The lesser yang governs the gallbladder, and its pulse runs along the side and connects at the ear; hence, there is chest and side pain along with deafness. After nine days, the lesser yang illness weakens, and the deafness is faintly discernible. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The energy of the lesser yang governs the pivot and the gallbladder; when the gallbladder&#39;s energy rises, all the yang energies rise correspondingly, as if prompted by cold that seeks to move the pivot. All yang energies emerge from the pivot and sides to the skin surface. The greater yang governs the exterior, the yangming governs the muscles, and the lesser yang governs the chest and flanks. Chest and flank pain combined with deafness indicates a disease in the energy manifesting as tangible symptoms. </p>
<p>When the disease is affected by cold in both aspects, after three days, both the lesser yang and the jueyin become ill, leading to deafness, retraction of the pouch and cold extremities, inability to ingest liquids, and unconsciousness, resulting in death on the sixth day.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lesser yang and jueyin are interrelated; thus, the manifestation of deafness in the lesser yang corresponds with the retraction and cold extremities in the jueyin. Inability to ingest liquids indicates a complete loss of digestive energy. Unconsciousness suggests damage to the spirit energy. When all organs and viscera are afflicted and the protective and nutritive energies fail to circulate, the exhaustion of energy leads to death.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The diseases born from the hand Taiyang involve deafness. The small intestine governs fluids, hence the reversal leads to tears. The heart governs blood vessels, while the small intestine governs fluids and represents the heart externally.

<p>(Note: The meridian of the foot Shaoyang begins at the corner of the eye, travels behind the ear into the ear canal, descends to the jaw, runs through the chest and sides, exits at the outer knee, and follows along the foot.

<p>In the section of inquiries, the Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What energy causes ringing in the ears?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;In the ears, there is a concentration of the ancestral vessels. When the stomach is empty, the ancestral vessels become deficient; when they are deficient, energy flows downwards, leading to a depletion of the pulse, and hence the ringing in the ears.&quot; </p>
<p>The lungs are related to the hundred pulses, and the ancestral vessels are the root of these hundred pulses, governed by the lungs. The ears are where the ancestral vessels gather. The blood and energy of the hundred pulses are produced by food and water. Therefore, when the stomach is empty, the ancestral vessels are deficient, causing the energy of the pulses to flow downwards. When the blood and energy within the pulse are depleted, it leads to ringing in the ears. Additionally, if the upper qi is insufficient, the ears suffer from painful ringing.</p>

<p><strong>The Reason Ears Can Hear Sounds</strong></p>
<p>In the fortieth difficulty, it is said: the lung governs sound, the ear is the opening of the kidney and is able to hear sounds; what does this signify? Indeed. The kidney corresponds to the water of the northern direction. Water is born in Shen, and Shen corresponds to the western metal; metal corresponds to the lung, which governs sound, thus allowing the ear to hear sounds. The lung is metal, and sounds arise from metal; hence, the lung governs sound. Although the nose belongs to the lung and cannot hear sounds, the ear belongs to the kidney and is able to hear. How is this possible? The kidney corresponds to the northern water and the branches of Shen, You, and Xu. Shen is the place where metal is exalted. Metal in the viscera is the lung, which governs sound. Although the ear belongs to the kidney—water—it is derived from the position of the lung, which is metal, thus enabling the ear to hear sounds.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The kidneys connect to the ears, and they govern essence. When essence and vital energy are balanced and kidney energy is abundant, the ears are able to hear clearly. However, if excessive labor injures the blood and vital energy, or if wind pathogens attack a weakened state, causing the essence to dissipate and the kidneys to weaken, then hearing may turn to deafness. There are also cases of deafness caused by qi obstruction, by wind invasion, or by labor damage. The twelve meridians converge at the ears; when the yin and yang channels intersect appropriately, the organ energy may reverse and lead to obstruction, which then affects the ears—this is known as obstructive deafness, and dizziness may accompany it at times.</p>
<p>The ears are connected to the governing vessel; if the vessel is vacuous and wind pathogens invade, wind enters the channels of the ears, obstructing the normal flow of energy—this is referred to as wind deafness, often accompanied by headaches. If excessive labor damages blood and energy, and indulgent desires deplete essence, resulting in emaciation and fatigue, this is called labor deafness. If one can properly maintain balance, with blood and energy harmonized, the deafness may temporarily lessen. If labor injury and wind stagnation persist, this leads to chronic deafness. </p>
<p>Moreover, if the ear is assaulted by wind pathogens and collides with qi, the resulting sound may be noisy, and one might perceive flashes before the eyes, indicating phantom sounds. If heat energy accumulates in a vacuous state and follows the channels into the ears without dispersing, resulting in pus discharge, it is known as ear pus. There is fluid between the ears; if light, it poses no harm, but if attacked by wind-heat, the fluids can coagulate, creating a blockage in the ear, leading to sudden deafness known as cerumen impaction.</p>
<p>The aforementioned conditions can be inferred from the kidney channels: wind can be superficial and abundant, heat can be surging and substantial, while a vacuous state can be thin and moist. Wind disperses, heat clears and facilitates, and a vacuous state requires nourishment. When the pathogenic qi retreats, one can then use remedies to open the ears, adjust the qi, and soothe the kidneys.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Ear</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the organ of the kidneys; the kidneys are where essence is stored. When kidney energy is sufficient, the vital essence rises and one can hear the five tones clearly. However, if one becomes overly fatigued and the vital essence is deficient, then external influences such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness can invade, and emotional disturbances like joy, anger, worry, and thought can cause internal injury, leading to deafness. Tinnitus, heat accumulation, along with bleeding or pus formation, can result in problems deep within the ear. If the complexion of the cheeks and temples is dark, it indicates deafness. There are cases where the lesser yang meridian is blocked and causes deafness, manifesting as a fiery sensation inside the ear. Conversely, if the greater yang meridian is blocked and causes deafness, there is fullness of energy in the ear. Generally, deafness due to energy blockage is relatively easier to treat, while deafness due to the loss of vital essence is harder to remedy with medicine. Different symptoms correspond to various treatment methods.</p>
<p>The ear reflects the state of the kidneys. The kidneys gather the essence, which flows to the ear. When kidney energy is balanced, one can hear the five tones clearly. When kidney energy is unbalanced, the ear suffers illness. Medical texts state that kidney energy connects to the ears. The heart resides in the ear; external factors like wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and heat impact the kidneys, while internal sources of distress such as worry and contemplation can create sores, resulting in deafness or swelling.</p>
<p>The six climatic factors harm the kidneys, and the seven emotions affect the heart. The method of treatment involves calming the heart and regulating energy. To ensure the energy flows smoothly and the heart is tranquil, the ear will respond with clarity. One should use a formula called &quot;Miao Xiang San,&quot; preparing it with calamus to brew a decoction to harmonize the heart&#39;s energy. Herbs like ginseng, dan, honey, and sand should be used to calm the heart. Additionally, medicines for regulating the kidneys, such as Cistanche, should be incorporated.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>Deafness is considered a disease, and common physicians often treat it with harsh and aggressive remedies, claiming it is due to the deficiency of kidney water and coldness. But do they not understand the balance of yin and yang between water and fire, the cold and heat of the heart and kidneys, the flourishing and declining of nourishment and defense? It is a matter of balance: when one side rises, the other must fall. This is the principle of harmonious regulation.</p>
<p>The heart fire is inherently hot; if it is deficient, it turns cold. The kidney water is inherently cold; if it diminishes, it turns hot. If the kidney water is already low, how can it result in cold illness? The classic texts state: &quot;When the kidney water of the lesser yin is deficient, it leads to fullness in the abdomen, heaviness in the body, watery diarrhea, ulcers that ooze, pain in the lower back and hips, stiffness in the joints and knees, anxiety, weakness in the legs, lack of joy, difficulty in bowel movements, a sense of fear as if being pursued, a bitter mouth, dry tongue, swelling in the throat, dry throat and pain, heart trouble and chest pain, jaundice, bowel discomfort with blood, pain in the spine, buttocks, and back of the thighs, weakness and desire to lie down, and heat and pain in the feet.&quot; From this, it is evident that the symptoms of kidney deficiency are all signs of heat.</p>
<p>The texts further state: &quot;If one travels far and is exhausted, and encounters extreme heat and thirst, thirst will lead to the inner consumption of yang energy, which refers to the consumption of the yin energy within the stomach; water cannot withstand fire, leading to heat remaining in the kidneys.&quot; The texts also mention: &quot;Bone weakness arises from extreme heat.&quot; Moreover, it states: &quot;Kidney heat causes dark complexion and brittle teeth.&quot; Generally, individuals with a dark complexion and brittle teeth will also be thin and have overheated ears.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The principle is this: when water is deficient, fire is abundant and hot. Excess leads to harm; thus, one must regulate it. Therefore, one counteracts the blackness of water. When kidney water is weak and scarce, it cannot moisten, resulting in dryness and withering. The teeth and ears are associated with the kidneys, hence their severity. If sores or ulcers become extremely hot with no moisture, the flesh becomes dry and blackened. Thus, when water is weak, heat clearly arises; how can one then claim it is cold? </p>
<p>Hence, the &quot;Immortal Classic&quot; states that the breath corresponds to the six-character qi, which corresponds to the six energies of the three yin and three yang organs. In reality, it manifests as the fundamental transformations leading to expulsion; when weakened, it follows the path of dominance consistent with expulsion to eliminate its obstructions. The so-called six-character qi includes liver hissing, heart exhaling, fire’s sighing, spleen calling, lung&#39;s breathing, and kidney’s blowing. Thus, by blowing away the cold from the kidneys, heat is generated; and by exhaling away the heart’s heat, cold is produced. </p>
<p>It is said that in spring, one does not blow; in summer, one does not exhale; in autumn, one does not hiss; in winter, one does not breathe out; throughout the four seasons, there are constant sighs, indicating the three burners are never insufficient; if the eight seasons cannot be blown, it means the kidneys find it hard to be robust. Observing through blowing, when the cold emotions of kidney water are expelled, the yang heat surges, and one experiences blurring of vision and dizziness. Weakness gives proof of heat. How can one then reverse this and use heating medicines to nourish water? Moreover, if water is scarce, it cannot overcome fire, and taking hot medicine, would it not be damaging? The classics state to treat heat with cold—this means cooling to curb fire and to treat cold with heat—this means heating to help fire and exhaust water.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the relationship between heat and cold in medical treatment. It states that although some may argue that heat can be treated by heat, the idea is derived from the notion that a patient&#39;s heat condition is severe and cold medicine is hard to administer; therefore, one may take heat-inducing remedies to follow the nature of the illness. Once the heat dissipates, the cold nature will emerge, leading to recovery from the heat illness.</p>
<p>It further explains that similar principles apply in the treatment of cold diseases. The text refers to the principle that cold is used to treat heat and heat to treat cold, emphasizing that these are still methods for treating heat-related conditions. The essence of treatment lies in reducing excess and nourishing deficiencies, achieving balance.</p>
<p>There is a caution against mistakenly categorizing heat as a manifestation of fire and cold as a manifestation of water, particularly in the context of kidney deficiency viewed as cold. The author warns against using cold medicine out of fear; instead, mistakenly opting for warming tonics before meals to counteract an overwhelming heat from the heart, only to take slightly cooling medicines post-meal to reduce heat. However, one might not realize that such approaches do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a disease essentially originates from heat and one consumes heating medicines, the condition can worsen despite later attempts to consume cold medicines. The wrong approach can lead to further complications. It highlights that the proper method does not support the idea of nurturing water to dampen fire.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it emphasizes that the balance of the five internal organs is the goal. This principle stands irrespective of the specific dynamics of each organ&#39;s functions and imbalances. Ultimately, the discussion revolves around the fluctuations in yang energy and the idea that if the lower body is cold, it indicates a deficiency of fire energy in the lower region; thus, heating remedies are used not to support kidney water, as deficient water cannot turn into cold.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Diseases arise not solely from the decline or changes in the internal organs but rather from the harm inflicted by internal and external evils. Hence, they lead to illness. Generally, when treating diseases, one must identify the source. If the illness is in the upper part, treat the upper; if in the lower, treat the lower; this applies to all internal organs, channels, and collaterals. If the pathogenic energy is heat, then eliminate the heat; if it is cold, then dispel the cold; the same principle applies to the six qi. Differentiate between excess and deficiency, expel evils and nourish the right, maintain balance, and this is the way of medicine. It is unwise to see a condition characterized by heat and then apply heat remedies while claiming to nourish water to overcome heart fire. This can be seen as seeking the path nearby while looking far away, pursuing ease while seeking difficulty, and it should be cautioned against! Thus, when it is said that kidney deficiency results in cold in the lower part, it does not imply that kidney water is deficient. It is said that there are two kidneys; the classics state that beside the seventh vertebra, there is a small heart located within. Yang Shangshan annotates &quot;Tai Su&quot; stating: the human spine has twenty-one segments, with the left side of the seventh segment being the kidney and the right being the Mingmen, which refers to the small heart. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; mentions that the origin of the heart emerges from the Tai Ling, and the Tai Ling point belongs to the Hand Jueyin and is associated with the fire of the small heart. The &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; states that needling the Tai Ling point is to drain the fire originating from the small heart. Therefore, the right kidney and Mingmen correspond to the small heart, which is connected to the Hand Jueyin’s fire. The &quot;Xian Jing&quot; states: the right kidney represents the male, and the left kidney represents the female. This is because the male is associated with Yang fire and the female with Yin water. To claim that a woman&#39;s left kidney is the Mingmen is a mistake.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that the right kidney is the gate of life; for men, it stores essence, whereas for women, it connects to the womb. Can these be contrary? However, the right kidney, as the gate of life, is closely associated with the hand&#39;s Jueyin organ, thus forming a relationship with the hand&#39;s Shaoyang Sanjiao in terms of interior and exterior, sharing the same divine pulse, as seen in the right wrist. Both channels represent the fire of the sovereign and minister, hence it is called the gate of life. Therefore, the &quot;Xianjing&quot; states: the heart is the sovereign fire, and the kidney is the minister fire. This indicates that the right kidney belongs to fire and not to water; thus, a deficiency of fire in the right kidney leads to cold illness. Although the sovereign and minister are two types of fire, in terms of the theory of the five elements, they are one in heat. </p>
<p>In the theory of the five elements, there is yin within yang and yang within yin; lonely yin does not thrive and alone yang does not persist. Only when a being fully encompasses the five elements and mutually nourishes one another can there be peace. Interactions leading to overcoming and destruction signify rise and fall. Disruption and deviation from the norm give rise to disasters. Thus, when water is scarce and fire abundant, there is yang excess and yin deficiency, causing illness from heat; when there is an abundance of water and scarcity of fire, there is yin excess and yang deficiency, causing illness from cold. Hence, using heat-inducing medicines to nourish the kidney and overpower the heart fire is misguided.</p>
<p>Whether due to indulgence leading to illness or prolonged conditions resulting in sickness, it is mistakenly considered that it is due to a deficiency of the original qi causing cold illness. However, the disturbances and strains are largely transformations of yang fire, with numerous cases of over-excitement and chaotic qi resulting in heat illness. Thus, the classics mention the ailments of heat and those related to the transformations of yin and yang and the exhausting of sexual energy.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when fever has not yet receded, and in cases of excessive drunkenness leading to rapid calamity, it is because yang heat can easily become violent. The essence of Taiyi, the true original qi, is neither yin nor yang, neither cold nor hot. Hence, the essence produces qi, and qi gives rise to spirit, with the spirit able to control its form. Thus, essence is the root of spirit and qi, and provides substance to the body. When strong, it is difficult for various pathogens to harm, but when weak, numerous diseases can easily invade. Why then does one say that original qi is deficient and becomes cold? Thus, in the elderly, qi declines, leading to many ailments such as dizziness, tinnitus, or deafness, shortness of breath, coughing, thick and sticky saliva, bitter mouth and dry tongue, difficulty in the throat, weakness in limbs, muscular atrophy, and dryness inside and outside, with constipation or urinary issues. These are all symptoms of heat due to yin deficiency and yang excess. Commonly, it is said that the elderly and weak are deficient in cold and lack heat.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Even though it is said that the manifestation of heat becomes less effective with a deficiency of water, and that the deficiency of kidney water is regarded as cold, this misunderstanding is prevalent worldwide. One must discern the interplay of yin and yang, of deficiency and excess, at the right time to avoid unwarranted suffering. One must be cautious not to recklessly use heating medicines to nourish one&#39;s true energy, for how can true energy be generated then? Thus, the &quot;Western Mountain Records&quot; states: if one consumes golden stones, there will be the danger of swift demise. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says that stone medicines cause madness, as they are born of excessive heat. If one wishes to use warming medicines for supplementation, the texts indicate that accumulated warmth leads to heat diseases; therefore, medications should not be taken recklessly. The method of nourishing true energy relies on a balanced diet, regular living habits, and avoiding undue labor to prevent harm, with a harmonious balance of yin and yang. This alone is beneficial. Although the &quot;Immortal Classics&quot; mention the consumption of elixirs, they are not suitable for everyone. Moreover, it is crucial to harmonize with substances that are neutral and non-toxic, simply to regulate one&#39;s energy.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A true practitioner of the Dao regards internal affairs as the essence of achievement and external affairs as the means of conduct; they do not rely on elixirs while hoping to attain the Dao. Therefore, the &quot;Immortal Classics&quot; further states that if one takes elixirs without preparing the five flavors and four energies and instead focuses on a single type, over time, the internal organs will be misaligned, leading to illness. How could one mistakenly take a hot remedy and expect benefits? It is said that deafness arises from the decline of water and the fullness of fire, with heat blocking the pathways, thus obstructing the entrance to the audible. What is observed is that when one closes their ears with both hands, it resembles the sound of a drum; this is called the celestial drum. The vital energy circulates and is blocked in the ears, leading to sound within, hence the ability to hear. If there is obstruction, the celestial drum is faintly heard. If the celestial drum is inaudible, then the entrance to hearing is completely closed, resulting in deafness where nothing is heard. Thus, one method involves soaking needle, sand, and wine, applying a magnet to the ear, intending to guide the energy to unblock it. </p>
<p>If someone asks: Since deafness relates to heat, why is it that taking spicy hot things like dried scorpion, ginger, aconite, and strong liquor sometimes leads to recovery? The answer is: They aim to open the entrance and allow the stagnant energy within the ears to flow out. Therefore, in the practice of preserving health, using medicinals with effective results can be likened to hearing a symphony of joyous sounds, as yang energy opens the pathways. In treating deafness, one must tailor their approach; if the heat condition has subsided yet deafness remains, then spicy and warming remedies should be used to stimulate. If a few doses do not yield results, it should not be continued for long, as excessive heat may lead to other ailments. If deafness is associated with a hot condition, it is advisable to use cooling remedies that dispel wind and clear heat to achieve recovery. However, if the deafness is severely blocked, it becomes quite difficult to treat.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One must be cautious not to attack too aggressively, as it may harm the vital energy. If it is not the correct illness, do not administer the remedy. Dietary principles should be followed: what is appropriate must not be taken to excess, or it will backfire against the vital energy. When the illness is gone, cease the medications. To seek health without harm is all that is needed. Therefore, regarding the treatment of serious poisons, ten methods eliminate six; for minor poisons, ten methods eliminate seven; for chronic poisons, ten methods eliminate eight; for non-poisons, ten methods eliminate nine. Nourish with grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables, and do not exceed, lest the vital energy be harmed. Practices should not be continued indefinitely, returning to the appropriate methods. Thus it is said: one must first account for seasonal influences, avoiding disturbance to the heavenly harmony. Do not have substance without emptiness, nor emptiness without substance, to prevent calamity for humankind. Do not invite evil, nor lose the proper way, which would cut off longevity. </p>

<p>The ears are not singular. In terms of perception, they are associated with water; in terms of sound, with metal. In terms of channels, both the lesser Yang of the hands and feet converge here. If there are sounds from within that cannot be heard, it relates to the master; if there are sounds from outside that cannot be perceived, it relates to the channels. There are sounds like cicadas, like chiming bells, or like roaring flames, each corresponding to the channels, and one must discern between the virtual and the actual. If one assumes that deafness relates to the kidneys, what then is the treatment for the lungs? The lungs govern sound; nasal congestion pertains to the lungs. What then is the treatment for the heart? The heart governs smell. By applying this method, all begins with the reception of energy. The kidneys receive energy at the hour of Si, the heart at the hour of Hai, the liver at the hour of Shen, the lungs at the hour of Yin, and the spleen governs all four seasons.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tinnitus and Deafness</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: Headache and tinnitus arise when the nine orifices are not functioning properly; this is generated by the intestines and stomach. When the stomach qi is deficient, the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose will all suffer. The classics further state: Yang qi, when overworked, expands; if it exhausts in summer, it leads to extreme weakness, resulting in blindness and deafness, as if the body is collapsing. Therefore, the essence of Heaven values clarity and purity, while Yang qi despises overwork. Diseases arising from the spleen and stomach are one such issue. </p>
<p>The pulse is taut, rapid, and deep. When one presses down, if there is a significant change, the symptom of tinnitus and deafness indicates the use of the &quot;Regulate Middle and Nourish Qi Decoction.&quot; The classics say: Headache and tinnitus arise when the nine orifices are not functioning properly; this is due to a weak stomach that cannot nourish the Hand-Taiyang Small Intestine and Hand-Yangming Large Intestine, leading to these symptoms. However, it results solely from the weakness of the stomach. Thus, the sages speak broadly of the generation from the intestines and stomach. </p>
<p>Some say: Is there evidence for what you claim regarding the generation from the intestines and stomach? I respond: The classics state that when the spleen is insufficient, it causes the nine orifices to be blocked, suggesting the spleen is a dead yin that receives the Yang qi of the stomach. It is able to elevate the qi of food and fluids to the lungs, filling the skin and dispersing into the four organs. Now, if the spleen cannot receive and transport qi to the organs, this leads to the mentioned symptoms. This is called the spleen deficiency causing the nine orifices to be closed. Although it is said to be a spleen deficiency, it is also caused by the inadequacy of the stomach.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ears are associated with the kidneys and serve the function of the lungs.</p>
<p>The ears connect to the upper airflow and are the orifice of the kidneys, serving the function of the lungs. The lungs are said to thrive within the offspring, which is the abode of the kidneys, thus enabling hearing sounds. Therefore, when essence is depleted, deafness occurs. This indicates that clear energy is received from the heavens, while exhaustion of the heart and depletion of the kidneys allow pathogens to enter.</p>
<p>Deafness is primarily attributed to heat. In cases of greater heat in the Shaoyang and Jueyin, one should use remedies like the opening phlegm dispersant, the Wind-Heat Tongsheng Powder, and the Rolling Phlegm Pills. For deafness following a severe illness, one should use the Four Substance Decoction to lower fire. </p>
<p>Deafness caused by Yin deficiency and active fire should also be treated with the Four Substance Decoction. </p>
<p>If deafness is due to stagnation, use the Tongsheng Powder refined with Da Huang wine, then stir-fry with wine three times before adding other herbs to be stir-fried with wine. For deafness, the use of Longhui Pills is essential, along with the Four Substance Decoction to nourish Yin.</p>
<p>For damp phlegm, one may use Shenxiong Pills or Betel Nut Pills.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat a solidified condition in the body, use betel nut and Shenxiong pills. A roaring sound in the ears indicates a deficiency in Yin or may also suggest a blockage of Qi; this is often due to heat causing the disturbance, leading to ringing in the ears.</p>
<p>For swelling and pain in the ears, a mixture of Qianghuo, Jingjie, and Fangfeng with wine-processed Dahuang and Huangqin, combined with a little musk, should be taken. If there is dampness, use dried alum for blowing.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Huangdi Acupuncture Classic,&quot; if the essence is depleted, it results in deafness. The kidneys are the root of the foot&#39;s Lesser Yin channel and store essence. They connect to the ears, which are where the main channels accumulate. When essence and Qi harmonize, the kidneys are robust, allowing one to hear the five tones. However, fatigue can injure Qi and blood, and together with wind and cold, can damage the kidneys, leading to essence depletion and subsequent deafness. The five organs, six viscera, and twelve meridians connect to the ears. When the Yin-Yang energies are disturbed, it leads to a condition known as &quot;Jue Qi&quot; that causes disturbances in the ear channels, resulting in deafness. If the deafness is due to kidney essence depletion, the complexion around the cheeks and cheekbones will appear dark. If the pulse of the Lesser Yang pathway is reversed, leading to deafness, you will observe a bright, shining sensation within the ears. If it’s the Taiyang pathway causing deafness, there will be fullness in the ear; in such cases, treatment with Shujing Powder is appropriate.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<p>The ear is where the meridians converge and is connected to the kidney qi, belonging to the foot&#39;s lesser yin channel.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable Efficacy of Excellent Formulas</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Tinnitus and Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness is associated with the Lesser Yin of the foot; the kidneys reside in the ears. The essence, governed by the kidneys, is essential; when the essence and vitality are harmonized and the kidney energy is sufficient, the ears will naturally be clear. Moreover, the causes of deafness are varied. There are those who suffer from exhaustion of vital energy and blood, where wind becomes combined with heat, leading to the essence’s depletion and resulting in fatigue and deafness; those who suffer from wind-induced deafness; and those whose labor has led to damage and deafness. The twelve meridians connect to the ears, and when these channels intersect adequately, the organ energies may rise in reverse, causing blockage that enters the ears, resulting in a condition known as wind deafness. </p>
<p>The ears are attached to the primary vessels; when the pulse is weak and wind evil invades, the wind enters the ears, obstructing the channel energies, causing wind deafness. Labor exhausts the blood and energies, and unrestrained desires consume the vital essence, leading to weakness and fatigue, producing symptoms of labor-induced deafness. Some individuals are adept at maintaining their health; their energies and blood remain balanced, and without excessive exertion, their condition gradually improves. Others fail to avoid exertion, and damage to their essence and spirit from labor and wind stagnation leads to persistent deafness. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases where wind evil comes into contact with the ears, clashing with the energies, resulting in a clamor of sounds, with the eyes possibly seeing flashes as a manifestation of phantom sounds. When there is hot energy invading through a weakness, entering the ears with the pulse, if heat accumulates without dispersing, it leads to a condition termed “ear pus.” Common practitioners often use harsh, drying, and heating medicines to address this issue, but this may frequently result from the deficiency of kidney water and the presence of cold. The heart fire is inherently hot; when deficient, it turns cold; the kidney water is inherently cold; when weakened, it can become hot.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When kidney qi is insufficient, how can it lead to illness? Therefore, one method involves soaking needle sand in wine for a day until evening, then taking out the needle sand and holding the wine in the mouth. Use a piece of magnet wrapped in cotton to block the ears, placing it on the left ear for the left side and the right ear for the right side, to guide the qi and promote its flow. </p>
<p>Someone asked, since deafness is caused by heat, how can taking hot substances like dry scorpion, ginger, prepared aconite, or strong wine sometimes lead to improvement? The answer is that these are used to open the source and relieve the obstruction in the ears. </p>
<p>In treating deafness, one must adapt to the appropriate methods. If the heat signs have diminished but the deafness persists, one should use spicy and warming medicinals to disperse it, stopping immediately when improvement occurs and avoiding prolonged use, lest excessive heat lead to other illnesses. If deafness is accompanied by heat signs, it is advisable to use methods to dispel wind and clear heat, thus resolving the blockage and achieving recovery. </p>
<p>However, if deafness is extremely severe, it can be very difficult to treat. Care must be taken not to attack it too aggressively, as it may harm the vital qi. If it is not the appropriate condition, do not take the medicine. The same principle applies to diet; moderation is crucial, as excess can damage the vital qi. Once the illness is resolved, discontinue the medicine. To seek health is merely to avoid harm. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said that the elderly tend to be weak and often sick, experiencing symptoms like dizziness, tinnitus, or respiratory difficulties. These are all signs of excess yang and deficiency of yin. The common saying is that the old and weak are deficient, cold, and without heat. Even if heat signs are present, it is often said that insufficient kidney water cannot withstand excessive fire, implying that deficient kidney water leads to coldness. This reflects the misunderstanding prevalent in society.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

The heavens produce water, thus at the beginning of life, there are two kidneys formed, with one hidden yin within, and there is also the fire of vitality residing in the gate of life. This vital fire often carries the momentum of the sovereign fire, thereby overpowering what cannot be defeated, as the text states, &quot;one water cannot overcome two fires.&quot; This condition may arise from excessive desires, overexertion, or after middle age, following a severe illness; when kidney water depletes, the yin fire flares up, resulting in constant ear itch and ringing. Sometimes it resembles the noise of cicadas, at other times like the sound of bells and drums, which can be extremely annoying. If untreated, it may gradually lead to senility, which is indeed lamentable! The treatment method should focus on draining the fire from the south and replenishing the water from the north; there is no one who is not unsettled by this.

<p><strong>Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The ears are the orifices of the kidneys, and all ear diseases pertain to the kidneys. Due to kidney deficiency, there may be sounds like waves or cicadas in the ears, or rapid deafness. One should use Minglong San, or chew beeswax with wine, and consume yellow wax porridge. If kidney deficiency persists and there are continuous sounds like waves or cicadas, leading to impaired hearing, it is advised to tonify the kidneys with Zhangqi and take Zhengyuan Decoction, along with Heixidan and An Shen Wan. If ear pus arises due to wind and toxins, it is called “Teng Ear.”</p>
<p><strong>Medical Summary</strong><br>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</p>
<p><strong>Eyes and Ears Receive Yang Qi for Clarity</strong></p>
<p>The human ears and eyes, like the essence of the moon, can only gain brightness with sunlight. Similarly, the ears and eyes must receive yang energy to achieve clarity. Therefore, when the yin blood of the ears and eyes is deficient, they cannot absorb yang energy, resulting in impaired sight and hearing. When the yang energy of the ears and eyes is deficient, the yin blood cannot sustain its function, leading to a loss of clarity as well. Thus, the clarity of the ears and eyes necessitates the mutual support of blood and qi to enable vision and hearing.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ear Diseases are Related to the Kidney and Liver</strong></p>
<p>The ear, in terms of orifices, is associated with the kidney’s water. The classic text states: the kidney governs the ears; within the organs, it is the kidney, and in terms of orifices, it is the ear. It also states: the kidney&#39;s energy connects to the ear. When the kidney is harmonious, the ear is able to hear the five tones. Furthermore, it is said that if essence is depleted, deafness occurs. Therefore, Luo Qianfu suggested that with essence depletion leading to deafness, the complexion should be dark around the cheekbones. The classic text states: if the liver is deficient, the eyes cannot see and the ears cannot hear, leading to great fear. Treatment uses the Four Substance Decoction, adding additional ingredients such as Fangfeng, Qianghuo, Chaihu, Changpu, and Fushen in equal portions, boiled and taken for over twenty doses. Then use a remedy of Duorenjiang and Xie powder. If the liver is deficient, ginger is used to replenish it.</p>
<p><strong>There are Four Causes of Deafness</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is: dampness evil injures the kidneys leading to deafness in the Sanjiao. The classic text states, &quot;the greater yin resides in the springs; dampness overcomes it, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness where the sound is unclear.&quot; Treatment for this is with bitter and warming remedies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is: dryness evil injures the liver leading to deafness. The classic text states, &quot;the yearly metal is excessive; as dry air circulates, the liver wood is affected, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness where nothing can be heard.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third is: fire evil injures the lungs leading to deafness. The classic text states, &quot;the yearly fire is excessive; as summer heat circulates, the lung metal is affected, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fourth is: wind heat disturbance above leads to deafness. The classic text states, &quot;the lesser yang governs heavenly affairs; wind and heat intermix, causing chaos and boiling clouds, leading to the people&#39;s illness of deafness and disturbance; with the arrival of the three energies, summer heat leads to inner heat deafness, which is treated with cold remedies.&quot;<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p>

It also states that when the liver&#39;s energy is strong, ear ringing and dizziness occur. Furthermore, the lesser yang&#39;s influence causes ear ringing and is treated with warming herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Pain is Related to Heat</strong></p>
<p>The classic text states: When the lesser yang&#39;s energy is strong, ear pain arises, which should be treated with warming herbs.</p>
<p><strong>The Distinction Between New and Old Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness must be categorized as new or old. New deafness is often due to heat, arising from an abundance of lesser yang and yangming fire, so it is advisable to disperse wind-heat and administer remedies to resolve phlegm obstructing the channels. Old deafness is often due to deficiency, as the kidney is commonly weak, so it is advisable to nourish and simultaneously open the channels. The pulse patterns indicate that the kidney is predominant; a slow, thin pulse indicates deficiency, a floating pulse indicates heat, a large floating pulse indicates wind, a deep and thick pulse indicates air, and a rapid, solid pulse indicates heat.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are three types of deafness.</p>
<p>When rich flavors stimulate the stomach fire, both ears become deaf; when anger stirs the gall bladder fire, the left ear becomes deaf; when lust stimulates the heart fire, the right ear becomes deaf. Among these, anger is the most prevalent.</p>
<p>Deafness can vary due to phlegm fire, wind, dampness, Qi blockage, exhaustion, or loss of essence and Qi. </p>
<p>Phlegm fire: Caused by rich foods heating the stomach, resulting in ringing in the ears; it can progress to Qi blockage and gradual deafness with fiery tears. For this, use Er Chen Tang with Huangbo, Mutong, Bianxu, and Qumai; if caused by alcohol, employ Tongsheng San with Nnoxing, Zhikua, and Dahuang, or consider Guo Phlegm Wan.</p>
<p>Wind deafness: Elicited by wind evils entering the ear, leading to itchiness, often accompanied by headaches due to wind heat, or can be due to stagnation. Use Fangfeng Tongsheng San, first stew Dahuang with wine, then stir-fry with other herbs in wine three times before decoction. For those with wind blockage affecting clarity, use Qingshen San; for those with wind deficiency, consider Paifeng Tang, Guixiang Yin, or Qiuzhi San.</p>
<p>Damp deafness: Resulting from exposure to rain, which leads to internal swelling and pain; use Liangge San with Qianghuo and Fangfeng, prepared with wine; or apply Wuling San with Chenpi, Zhikua, Zisuan, and Shengjiang. For damp phlegm, use Shenqiung Wan. If there is blockage accompanied by dizziness, the treatment for those with excess from anger is Danggui Longhui Wan; for those weak from worry, use Miaoxiang San; for stagnation due to sadness, consider Liuqi Yinzi with Changpu; and for those with excess above and deficiency below, utilize Mijuan Jiangqi Tang with Changpu.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Deafness from Deficiency:</strong> This occurs after prolonged diarrhea or severe illness, where wind pathogens enter the ear through a weakened state and clash with the vital energy, resulting in a noisy ringing. If there are also symptoms of visual disturbances, such as seeing dark flowers, the prescription may include Siwu Decoction with additions of Rhizoma Acori and Polygala, or Shenqi Pill with additions of magnetite, medicated leaven, Cuscuta seed, and Huangbo. For those with Yang deficiency, Bamei Pill, Yishen Powder, or Magnetite Decoction are recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Deafness from Overuse:</strong> Characterized by a dull and heavy sensation, along with emaciation and weakness. This results from overexertion depleting vital energy, requiring Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Rhizoma Acori; if there is heat, add Rhizoma Zhi, Huangbo, and Poria; in cases of sexual exhaustion, Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction with Rhizoma Zhi, Huangbo or Bugu Zhi Pill should be used. If there is prolonged deafness due to a weak kidney and absolute qi deficiency leading to complete inability to hear, treatment is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Main Points:</strong> Harmonizing qi and opening the auditory orifices are essential. The kidney&#39;s water pathways influence the ears’ ability to hear, as water generates from metal. The lungs control the qi, which flows throughout the body to the ears, thereby enabling sound perception. In all cases of deafness, one should first harmonize qi and alleviate stagnation, intermittently using magnetism and Yang Kidney Pill to open the orifices. Generally, deafness is due to phlegm and fire stagnation; unless magnetism weighs down and disperses the phlegm and fire, with the use of spices like cinnamon and pepper, along with Rhizoma Acori, it remains difficult to clear the old phlegm and heat. However, this approach can also be overpowering, so after treatment, using Tong Sheng Powder for harmonization is advisable.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p>Tinnitus is the gradual onset of deafness; when the energy is blocked, there is often no sound leading to deafness. For tinnitus caused by wind-heat, one can use Detox Decoction with raw Rehmannia and Anemarrhena, or Tong Sheng Powder. If phlegm-heat is severe, use Dang Gui Long Hui Pills. If accompanied by dampness, use Shen Xiong Pills or Qing Mu Xiang Pills. For slight ringing due to kidney deficiency, use Zi Shen Pills; for qi deficiency, take Si Jun Zi Decoction; for blood deficiency, Si Wu Decoction; for yin deficiency, use Hu Qian Pills.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Inflammation, Purulent Ear, Ear Pain</strong></p>
<p>Ear inflammation and pain are typically due to wind-heat. The ear contains oil and liquid, which can become bound by wind-heat into a mass, causing ringing or deafness. For treatment, externally apply a mixture of pig fat, earthworm, and pot coal, forming them into balls with ginger juice, the size of jujube pits, wrapped in cotton and inserted into the ear to moisten and remove impurities. In severe cases, take Chai Hu Cong Er Decoction internally. For purulent ear infection with wind-heat obstructing upward, externally use five parts dried alum, two parts each of burnt tangerine peel and rouge, and half a part of musk, ground into powder to blow into the ear; for severe cases, take Xi Jiao Yin Zi internally. For pain that feels like insects crawling, it is due to excessive wind; if it is dry pain, this may indicate wind-heat or deficiency fire; if there is blood and water, it indicates wind-dampness. Externally, use burnt snake skin powder, or blowing in dried alum powder can also work; for severe pain, use Wu Yu, Aconite tips, and rhubarb to grind into powder to apply to the feet; in severe cases, take Dong Yuan Shu Nian Zi Decoction internally.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the orifice of the kidneys, and its diseases can be classified into several types: there are those who are deaf due to wind obstruction, those who suffer deafness from laborious exertion, those who are deaf from heat and pathogens entering the ear, and those who have purulent ear conditions resulting from wind and heat obstructing bodily fluids, causing sudden deafness and a buzzing sensation. Additionally, there are people who are deaf in the left ear, those deaf in the right ear, and those deaf in both ears; it is essential to distinguish these for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods</strong><br>For those deaf in the left ear, excessive anger stirs the lesser yang gallbladder fire, so treatment begins on the left side using Longhui Pills. For those deaf in the right ear, excessive desire stimulates the greater yang bladder fire, thus treatment begins on the right side using Liuwei Dihuang Pills. For those deaf in both ears, excessive consumption of rich foods and alcohol incites the stomach fire of the foot yangming, so treatment is approached from the center using Tongsheng Powder and Guo Phlegm Pills. Notably, left ear deafness is more common among women due to their propensity for anger, while right ear deafness is more prevalent in men due to excessive desire. Those deaf in both ears often come from affluent households because of their indulgence in rich flavors. Overall, among these three, anger is the most common cause of deafness.</p>
<p>When phlegm and fire rise, causing both ears to buzz and gradually lead to deafness, it is advisable to modify the Longhui Pills, along with needles, sand wine, and Tongyong Liqi Decoction and FucHong Decoction.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ear Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Standards Synopsis Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi)</strong><br><strong>General Discourse on Tinnitus and Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus and hearing loss must be classified by their onset—whether sudden or chronic, and their nature—whether due to deficiency or excess. Sudden deafness or ringing resulting from intense anger or drunkenness is attributed to phlegm and fire, distinguishable by their severity. </p>
<p>For middle-aged individuals or those with a deficiency, or for those who experience this after illness, all are deemed deficient. It is vital to differentiate between qi (vital energy) and blood in relation to the ear. </p>
<p>Ancient prescriptions include using mouse bile, cat urine, and vine flowers to make drops for the ear; skinning almonds, adding salt, steaming, and then applying oil drops; skinning castor seeds, mixing with a jujube, mashing, and wrapping with cotton to seal the ear; hollowing garlic cloves, filling them with fried and cooked medicinal beans, and wrapping with cotton to seal; mixing realgar and medicinal beans with scallion juice and rolling in paper to seal the ear; and using Sichuan pepper, medicinal beans, calamus, and resin, formed into a tube to seal the ear. </p>
<p>Moreover, incorporating xixin (wild ginger), puhuang (cattail pollen), curcuma, and almonds into a pellet to block the ear is also noted. When adding dragon&#39;s brain and peppercorn, these are primarily warming and dispersing methods, intended for promoting and unblocking the orifices, which may yield results if the condition arises abruptly. </p>
<p>However, if the original qi is insufficient, and kidney yin is depleted, with deficient fire carrying phlegm rising and blocking the orifices leading to deafness and ringing, then even repeated applications or insertions will be powerless—as futile as ants shaking a rock.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is necessary to greatly replenish Qi and blood, nourish Yin and control fire, so that the great Qi rises and fills the head, ensuring that the nine orifices are unobstructed and hearing issues are eliminated. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;Kidney Qi is connected to the ears; when the ears are harmonious, one can discern the five tones.&quot; If the Kidney Qi does not flow to the ears, then the ears are disharmonious and one becomes deaf. If it can connect upward to the ears, then the ears will be harmonious and hearing will be acute. Observing this, the distinction between deficiency and excess is evident.</p>
<p>In cases of Kidney deficiency, when there is a constant sound of water or cicadas in the ears, hindering hearing, one should replenish Qi and nourish the Kidneys with Zhengyuan Decoction and Black Lead Pill, intermittently taking Anshen Pills. If there is heat, Longchi San should be used. For wind in the Kidneys causing ear ringing and a drum-like sound at night, with aching in the limbs, and a strange itching sensation in the ears as if blown by wind, Huangqi Pills are advisable.</p>
<p>The ears are known to belong to the Kidneys. However, the Shaoyang Gallbladder meridian connects to the ears; thus, when cold evil transmits to the Shaoyang, ear deafness and lateral pain occur. If women experience prolonged depression, lumps may form in front of and behind the ears; if they are overtaken by sudden anger, they may suddenly go deaf—this is due to fire invading the primary channels, not solely the Kidneys.</p>
<p>For ear deafness and ringing, there may be phlegm and heat, Qi deficiency, Yin deficiency, or Liver fire. In youth, it is mostly due to phlegm and heat, while in middle age, it is primarily Yin deficiency.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

Medications include Bupleurum, Green Peel, Cyperus, Angelica, Gardenia, Wine-Soaked Scutellaria, Lianqiao, Rehmannia, Peony, Fritillaria, and ye jiao. If there is swelling and fever, with exterior symptoms, the primary remedy is Jingfang Baidu Powder. If a hard and swollen lump persists below the ear, exacerbated by irritability, it is related to depression, and the remedy is the Yao Jue Pill.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu]</p>
<p><strong>Six Types of Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>Various books discuss six types of deafness: Qi deafness, Fire deafness, Wind deafness, Syncope deafness, Labor deafness, and Yin deafness; additionally, there are symptoms of ear noise and purulent ears. Generally, the ear is associated with the Kidney channel of the Lesser Yin of the foot, as the Kidney connects to the ear. The Kidney governs the essence, and when the essence and Qi are in harmony, the Kidney Qi is sufficient, allowing the ear to hear clearly. However, if one overexerts and damages the Blood and Qi, leading to loss of essence and weakness of the Kidney, deafness is inevitable. Furthermore, the twelve meridians connect to the ear; when the Yin and Yang channels intersect and the organ energies flow into the ear causing syncope, this is called syncope deafness, often accompanied by dizziness. The ear is connected to the ancestral channel; if the channel is weak and Wind evil takes advantage, the Qi becomes stagnant and cannot be expressed, which is termed Wind deafness, typically leading to headaches. If labor exhausts Qi and Blood, and indulging in desires depletes essence, resulting in fatigue and muddled senses, this is Labor deafness, often accompanied by additional signs of weakness—common in those with Kidney deficiency due to excessive desires. If Phlegm Fire ascends, becoming trapped in the ear and causing ringing, along with fever entering the ear, leading to pus formation, this is termed purulent ears. Sometimes there may be fluid in the ears; when Wind and Heat strike, it hardens into a blockage, leading to sudden deafness, which is called ear noise. All the aforementioned conditions should be attributed to Kidney issues. Wind is superficial, Heat is abundant, and deficiency is weak and subtle. Treat Wind with dispersals, Heat with cleansing, Kidney deficiency with tonics, and Phlegm Fire with cooling and descending methods. Each should be treated accordingly; is there not a way to restore hearing?<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Hearing loss and tinnitus due to heat are common</p>
<p>It is often said that elderly people predominantly have deficiency and coldness rather than heat, which is a misconception of this world. In general, the elderly have declining vitality and many ailments, experiencing dizziness, tinnitus or hearing loss, shortness of breath and coughing, thick and sticky saliva, bitter mouth and dry tongue, muscle weakness and rapid pulse, and constipation. These are all signs of yin deficiency with excess yang. Therefore, the classics state: by the age of forty, the yin energy is already half, leaving only the solitary yang to flourish, which is evidenced by signs of heat. If heat-inducing medicines are administered, it only increases the fire. Hence, cooling medicines are inappropriate, and one must instead rely on warm and balanced treatments that thoroughly address the issue. </p>
<p>Hearing loss due to qi deficiency should be seen after major illnesses.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After a serious illness, if a person becomes deaf, it is often due to Qi deficiency. If an elderly person experiences gradual hearing loss, it is also due to Qi deficiency. If the deafness is severe and accompanied by a ringing in the ears, there may also be phlegm present, and one should not use strong tonics.</p>
<p>Deafness should primarily focus on unblocking Qi and alleviating stagnation.</p>
<p>The condition of deafness arises from blocked Qi pathways and the accumulation of phlegm-fire, leading to obstruction. When using medicines to clear phlegm and reduce fire, they must also include pungent herbs to move Qi and open the orifices; this is key to the treatment method. Ancient formulas involved soaking needle sand in alcohol for a day, then removing the sand and holding the alcohol in the mouth while using a tightly wrapped magnetic stone to plug the ear: the left ear for left deafness, and the right ear for right deafness, aimed at guiding the Qi to relieve the obstruction. If strong phlegm-fire medications are used, they can harm the spleen and stomach, worsening the blockage. If one rushes to tonify Qi deficiency, it can exacerbate fire and also fail to relieve the obstruction. It is only through the previous method, using phlegm-fire medicines combined with gently warming herbs to gradually balance the treatment, that natural recovery occurs. I have seen that overzealous treatment can harm the righteous Qi and lead to other illnesses; this should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>The treatment for deafness should aim to drain from the south and tonify the north.</p>
<p>Worry and overthinking damage the heart, leading to heart deficiency and blood loss, which inevitably results in deafness and tinnitus. Excessive sexual activity damages the kidneys, resulting in kidney deficiency and depletion, which likewise results in deafness and tinnitus. The treatment should focus on draining from the south and tonifying from the north, with an emphasis on nourishing yin and reducing fire. For heart deficiency, calming the heart and smoothing Qi should be prioritized, utilizing selections like Chen Sha Miao Xiang San or Ping Bu Zhen Xin Dan. For kidney deficiency, one should benefit from essence and tonify the kidneys with Rou Cong Rong Wan.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>The symptom of tinnitus may sound like a cicada, occurring in either ear, and can often feel blocked. Many people mistakenly treat it as kidney deficiency, not realizing that it is caused by phlegm-fire rising and becoming trapped in the ears. When the obstruction is severe, it becomes blocked. In such cases, one should examine whether there has been a history of heavy drinking and rich food, which can lead to accumulation of phlegm-fire in the upper body. The treatment should focus on clearing phlegm and reducing fire. Generally, this condition arises when phlegm-fire is already present in the upper body and is aggravated by anger, causing the qi to rise, with the lesser yang fire affecting the ears. If the tinnitus is due to kidney deficiency, the sound will be less severe, and the person will often exhibit symptoms of desire, fatigue, or similar signs.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the previous condition involves blood deficiency and heat, one should use the Four Substance Decoction with added Gardenia and Bupleurum. If it is due to weak central qi, one should use the Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction. If both blood and qi are deficient, the Eight Treasure Decoction with added Bupleurum should be used. If anger leads to deafness or ringing, it pertains to excess in the liver and gallbladder channels, treated with the Small Bupleurum Decoction plus Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Gardenia. For deficiency, use the Eight Treasure Decoction with Gardenia. If the tinnitus is more pronounced in the morning, it indicates excess yang heat, requiring the Small Bupleurum Decoction with Coptis and Gardenia. If yang qi is deficient, use the Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction with Bupleurum and Gardenia. If it worsens in the afternoon, it suggests a deficiency of yin blood, treated with the Four Substance Decoction plus Atractylodes and Poria. If kidney deficiency leads to heat or if there is excessive phlegm causing thirst, the use of Rehmannia Pills is essential. It is stated: headache and tinnitus arise from the nine orifices not functioning properly, which is caused by issues with the intestines and stomach. If the spleen and stomach are deficient, the eyes and ears may also be affected.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the orifice of the kidneys, governing the Lesser Yin of the feet. Among the twelve meridians in the human body, all but the Taiyang of the feet and the Jueyin of the hands connect with the ear. Therefore, in treating ear conditions, the kidneys are the primary focus. Some say that the heart also opens to the ear; why is this? This is because the heart’s orifice is originally in the tongue, and since the tongue has no openings, it is hence reliant on the ear. Thus, the kidney is the master of the ear orifice, while the heart is merely a guest. The five organs correspond to the five orifices, classified in terms of yin and yang. The kidneys and liver belong to yin, hence the ear and eyes are governed by yin essence; while the heart, spleen, and lungs belong to yang, hence the mouth, nose, and tongue are governed by yang essence. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: kidney energy connects to the ear, and when the kidney is harmonious, one can hear the five tones. If the five organs are not harmonious, the seven orifices remain blocked. Thus, any one meridian or channel whose essence enters the ear is enough to disrupt its clarity and lead to deafness. This refers to sudden deafness. However, for chronic deafness, there is also a distinction in the essence and energy of the kidneys. The left kidney governs yin and essence, while the right kidney governs yang and qi. If essence is insufficient but qi is abundant, the deafness is of a deficient nature. If an individual is thin and dark in color, with strong muscles and bones, this indicates an excess of both essence and energy, resulting in closure and blockage, hence the deafness is of a solid nature, which may signal longevity.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Both conditions arise from innate endowments and do not require treatment. There are also sudden cases of deafness; the texts say that those who do not understand the harmony of the seven losses and eight benefits face premature decline. If one is under fifty years old and has become heavy and less perceptive of hearing and sight, that is frightening. If there is deafness accompanied by dark facial complexion, it indicates exhaustion of the essence and kidney. One should use An Shen Wan, Ba Wei Wan, Cong Rong Wan, or Shu Yu Wan, selecting according to the situation. If there is kidney deficiency and excessive fire, with a flushed face, dry mouth, and phlegm indicating internal heat, Liu Wei Wan is to be used. This discusses cases of yin deficiency. As for yang deficiency, there can also be hearing loss. The texts say that clear yang emerges from the upper orifices. The energy of the stomach is the clear and source energy, the energy of spring ascent, sharing the same origin yet different names. Nowadays, people are burdened by diet and fatigue, leading to a deficiency in spleen and stomach energy, which cannot rise and flows down to the kidneys and liver. Thus, the yang energy becomes obstructed, and the earthly energy impedes clarity, causing detrimental effects on the orifices, leading to unclear hearing and vision. This yang deficiency deafness should be treated with Dong Yuan’s Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If one can nourish appropriately and achieve balance in qi and blood, the deafness will gradually lighten; if one does not know moderation and exacerbates fatigue daily, it will lead to prolonged deafness. Additionally, there are also cases of deafness caused by external pathogens due to deficiency, such as when the cold pathogen enters the Shaoyang, which requires treatment tailored for each channel.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also conditions such as ear pain, tinnitus, itchy ears, ear discharge, and ear sores, which should be treated according to the differentiation of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess in the Shaoyin meridian. One should not solely rely on treating fire and external pathogens. If tinnitus stops when pressed by hand or lessens slightly, it indicates deficiency; if it worsens when pressed, it indicates excess. Wang Jiezai states that if the tinnitus sounds like cicadas, occurring intermittently on one side or the other, many people mistakenly treat it as kidney deficiency, which is ineffective. They fail to realize that it arises from phlegm-heat ascending and obstructing the ear, potentially leading to more severe blockage. Those who frequently consume alcohol and rich foods often have phlegm-heat in the upper jiao, and should simply treat by clearing phlegm and descending fire. Generally, this condition often arises from pre-existing phlegm-heat in the upper body, which, when combined with anger, causes qi to rise, with the lesser yang fire being present in the ear. If the tinnitus is due to kidney deficiency, it will not be severe, and the individual will likely exhibit symptoms of excessive desires, fatigue, or weakness. Xue Li Zhai provides a detailed classification, stating that if there is blood deficiency with heat, one should use the Four Substance Decoction plus Mountain Gardenia and Bupleurum. If there is weakness of the middle qi, use the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Benefit Qi. If both blood and qi are deficient, use the Eight Treasure Decoction plus Bupleurum. If there is deafness or tinnitus caused by anger, it belongs to the liver and gallbladder meridian&#39;s qi excess, and one should use the Small Bupleurum Decoction plus Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Mountain Gardenia; if deficient, use the Eight Treasure Decoction plus Mountain Gardenia.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on the Ear</strong></p>
<p>The ear belongs to the Foot Shaoyin Kidney channel. The &quot;Zhong Zang Jing&quot; states: The kidney is the dwelling of the spirit, the root of life, and externally connects to the ear. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The kidney opens in the ear; when the kidney is harmonious, it can perceive the five sounds. It further states: The kidney governs external hearing, perceiving the ear&#39;s preferences to infer its nature. Thus, if the ear appears to sit forward towards the teeth, the kidney is upright. Note: The &quot;tooth car&quot; refers to the Jia Che acupoint, located in the groove under the jaw beneath the ear. If one ear is higher, the kidney on that side is tilted; if the ear is high, the kidney is high; if the ear has a depression, the kidney is low; if the ear is firm, the kidney is firm; if the ear is thin and not firm, the kidney is fragile. The &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; states: If the ear is thin and black or white, the kidney is failing. Additionally, it is also associated with the Hand Shaoyin Heart channel.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The south is red, which connects to the heart and opens the orifices to the ears. It also mentions that the channels of the hand&#39;s shaoyin converge in the ears. Additionally, it relates to the hand taiyin lung meridian.</p>
<p>Li Dongyuan said: The ears are fundamentally governed by the kidneys, yet they are able to hear sounds because sound corresponds to metal, indicative of the presence of lung within the ears, since water and earth originate from the shen. Wang Taifu noted that the channels of the hand taiyin lung converge in the ears. When the lungs are deficient, there is insufficient qi, leading to an inability to respond to sounds, hence the condition of deafness. This also pertains to the foot jueyin liver meridian.</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: In cases of liver disease with reversed qi, deafness occurs. Zhu Danxi indicated that deafness is associated with heat, primarily involving the lesser yang and jueyin heat. It also connects with the hand and foot shaoyang sanjiao and gallbladder, as well as the hand taiyang small intestine channels.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; notes: The lesser yang roots in the qiao yin and converges in the window cage; the window cage refers to the interior. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that one yang solely howls as the lesser yang&#39;s destiny, resulting in deafness at the end. Howling refers to the sound echoing in the ears. The gallbladder and sanjiao channels both enter the ears; therefore, if qi reverses upwards, a ringing in the ears occurs. It further states that the lesser yang governs the gallbladder, its channel winding at the ribs towards the ears; thus, after three days of cold damage, if the lesser yang is affected, pain in the chest and ribs ensues alongside deafness; after nine days of a weakened lesser yang, deafness becomes minimally perceived. Additionally, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions that diseases arising from the hand taiyang lead to deafness and jaundiced eyes. This also correlates with the hand and foot yangming large intestine and stomach channels.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Headache and tinnitus arise from the dysfunction of the nine orifices, originating in the intestines and stomach. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; explains: For deafness accompanied by pain, treat the hand&#39;s Yangming; for deafness without pain, treat the foot&#39;s Shaoyang. It also says: The ears are where the ancestral channel gathers; when the stomach is empty, the ancestral channel is weak, leading to a downward flow, causing a depletion in the channels and resulting in tinnitus. Furthermore, it is linked to the Foot Taiyang Bladder channel.</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; further states: The Taiyang&#39;s concept of tinnitus arises because the Yang qi is abundant and surges upward, hence the ear ringing. It is also connected to the Hand and Foot Shaoyin Heart and Kidney, Taiyin Lung and Spleen, and the Foot Yangming Stomach channels.</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; notes that all five channels are related to the ear, with the upper channel affecting the left ear and causing illness when disturbed by pathogens. The area in front of the ear is connected to the Hand and Foot Shaoyang Sanjiao and Gallbladder, and the Foot Yangming Stomach channels.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the &quot;Su Wen,&quot; the arteries entering the area before the ear are located in the depression just in front of the ear. The movement corresponds to the hand, as it is where the qi of the hand&#39;s Shaoyang circulates. Behind the ear, it pertains to the gathering of the Hand and Foot Shaoyang Sanjiao and Gallbladder channels.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li Dongyuan said: &quot;The Shaoyang refers to the area slanting out from the front and back of the ear.&quot; Below the ear, the curved cheek belongs to the convergence of the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder and Yangming Large Intestine Channels, and also pertains to the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine Channel. </p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: &quot;The Hand Taiyang is at the curved cheek.&quot; The front part of the curved cheek corresponds to the convergence of the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder and Yangming Large Intestine Channels, while the area about an inch in front pertains to the Hand Yangming Large Intestine Channel. The back of the curved cheek belongs to the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Channel.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; notes: &quot;The Foot Shaoyang is behind the curved cheek beneath the ear.&quot; Zhao Yide remarked: &quot;The ear is the orifice of the kidneys, governed by the Foot Shaoyin Channel. However, the heart also has its orifice in the ear. Among the twelve channels in the human body, except for the Foot Taiyang and Hand Jueyin, the other ten channels all connect to the ear. The kidneys manage the internal yin, while the heart governs the external yang; combined, they reflect the way of heaven and earth, with essence and energy interconnected everywhere. Therefore, the pure and bright energy goes upwards to the orifices, allowing the ear to receive it and attain hearing. Thus, the ear belongs to the orifices of two organs.</p>
<p>In this way, the various channels embody their yin, yang, and five elements; those that are pure and bright all ascend into this. Hence, the five sounds of Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zheng, and Yu can be distinguished from this. The classic states: &quot;Accumulation of yang is heaven; accumulation of yin is earth. Clear yang emerges from the upper orifices.&quot; If the two energies are unbalanced, then communication does not manifest, hence yang energy becomes obstructed and earth energy becomes muddled.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The blockage of Yang Qi may stem from fatigue causing Yin deficiency and Qi floating, or from Wei Qi not descending, circulating and accumulating above. It could arise from the simultaneous presence of external wind and Yang, or excessive heat, or the isolated brilliance of the fire of the Sanjiao. This results in muddiness and turbidity in the ears, possibly caused by heat accumulation in the organs, or due to great anger causing Qi to rise without descending. All these conditions are due to the disharmony of the heart&#39;s Qi; if it is deficient, it cannot govern Yang, and if it is excessive, it relies solely on the strength of Yang, cutting off Yin. The classics say: “The ultimate Yin’s deficiency leads to the cessation of the heavenly Qi.” </p>
<p>As for the invasion of Earth Qi by brightness, it may be due to unresolved sorrow causing closure of Yin Qi, which does not connect with Yang, or due to internal and external dampness obstructing the Qi, preventing it from rising or falling, thus also resulting in muddiness and turbidity in the ears, or the depletion of kidney essence. If the essence is depleted due to a heat illness, complete loss of both pulse indicators signifies death. </p>
<p>An ear condition due to disharmony of the two Qi can result in a blockage from accumulating earwax. All these issues arise from disharmony in kidney Qi; when deficient, Yin Qi is weak and cannot ascend to meet Yang, and when excessive, Yin Qi rises against Yang, rejecting it. </p>
<p>The condition of sudden deafness is not severed from the separation of Yin and Yang; the channels desire to flow but are not open. If they are struck and agitated internally, stimulating the auditory orifice, and depending on the subtlety of the Qi, various sounds like a tumultuous wind and rain may emerge. Thus, one can treat the condition by following the evil, supplementing the deficiency, and draining the excess, striving for Yin and Yang&#39;s harmony. Naturally, the clear and pure Qi will ascend to the ears, restoring hearing.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: If what you express indicates that water and fire open this orifice equally, how can the &quot;Original Disease Formulas&quot; not be considered warming and strengthening? It is said: The heart is connected to the orifice as the tongue; since the tongue is not an orifice, the orifice is related to the ears, thus the kidneys are the master of the ear orifice, and the heart is a guest of the ear orifice. The five organs open their orifices to the face, distinguishing between yin essence and yang qi. The kidneys and liver reside in yin, hence the ear and eye orifices are governed by yin essence; the heart, lungs, and spleen reside in yang, hence the mouth, tongue, and nose orifices are governed by yang qi. Therefore, those in charge of yin essence value clarity and coolness while rejecting heat and disturbance; those in charge of yang qi value warmth while rejecting coldness and chill. The ancient elders had such discussions, believing that the ears and eyes cannot be warmed and strengthened. </p>
<p>For deafness due to wind deficiency, use solutions such as Wind-Dispelling Decoction, Cinnamon Star Powder, Lamb Kidney Soup, Fish Brain Ointment, Magnetic Stone Pill, and Ginger Scorpion Powder. </p>
<p>For deafness due to wind heat, use remedies such as Rhinoceros Horn Decoction, Peony Powder, Rhinoceros Horn Powder, and Poria Powder. </p>
<p>For ear deafness arising from depression, for mild cases, take the Returning Elixir; for severe cases, take the Nurturing Right Elixir. For all treatments of ear deafness, it is essential to regulate qi. </p>
<p>There are three types of ear deafness due to reversed qi: those related to the liver, the hand taiyang, and the shaoyang. The classics state: When liver qi is reversed, it causes headaches, deafness, and facial swelling. It further states: When the taiyang is said to be &quot;floating,&quot; it is all about qi.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Luo Qianfu said: When the hand of the Taiyang channel experiences a blockage of qi causing deafness, the symptom is fullness of air in the ear; when the hand of the Shaoyang channel experiences a blockage of qi causing deafness, the symptom is a sensation of muddiness and confusion in the ear. All of these conditions arise from reversed qi leading to deafness. The treatment methods should include the Four Substance Decoction, the Longhui Pill for reducing fire, and the Recovery and Circulation Powder to regulate qi.</p>
<p>For those with deafness accompanied by a dark complexion on the cheeks, this indicates loss of essence and kidney deficiency. Luo Qianfu states: As the classics say, loss of essence leads to deafness. The kidneys belong to the Foot Shaoyin channel and store essence while the qi flows to the ears. The ears are where the ancestral vessels converge. If essence and qi are harmonized, the kidneys are strong, and one can hear the five tones. However, if one exhausts qi and blood through overwork, combined with invasion of wind pathogens damaging the kidneys, leading to loss of essence, then deafness occurs. </p>
<p>In this regard, all five organs, six bowels, and the twelve meridians that connect to the ears have their yin and yang qi mutually interacting; when they do interact, the organ’s qi may reverse, which is termed &quot;jué&quot; (blockage). When the qi of blockage collides and enters the meridian of the ear, it leads to deafness. In the case of kidney-related deafness with loss of essence, the characteristic is a blackish hue on the cheeks. In the case of the movement of the hand in the Shaoyang meridian causing blockage and deafness, the symptom is a muddled sensation in the ear. For the hand of the Taiyang channel experiencing blockage and deafness, the symptom is deafness along with fullness of inner qi; thus, it is appropriate to use the Shao Shen San to address it. </p>
<p>The Shao Shen San, Yi Shen San, Bu Shen Wan, Cong Rong Wan, Rou Cong Rong Wan, and Sang Piao Xiao Decoction are suitable for those with kidney deficiency and cold.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Deafness with little energy and a dry throat indicates lung deficiency. Dongyuan states: According to the theory of organ qi, when the lungs are deficient, there is insufficient energy to breathe, leading to deafness and a dry throat. The commentary explains that the lung&#39;s meridian connects to the ears, hence the deafness. However, this explanation is inadequate. In fact, when qi is deficient, it must be cold; if excessive, both qi and blood stagnate and fail to circulate. The ears are associated with the primordial qi; if lung qi does not circulate, deafness results. It is advisable to take Shengmai San and chew down wax pills.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ear Furuncle</strong></p>
<p>Some ask what it means when a furuncle grows on the auricle. It is called &quot;ear furuncle,&quot; related to the hand Shaoyang Sanjiao meridian, caused by wind and heat. After six or seven days, it gradually swells like a walnut, or takes on the shape of a honeycomb, either red or purple, hot like fire, with pain piercing the heart. If, after ten days, yellowish-white pus can be drained, the patient is likely to survive; if there is no pus, but fresh blood sometimes flows, and the patient cannot eat and shows signs of confusion and delirium, they may die. It is said that in children, if a furuncle grows beside the ear canal, it is attributed to pointing at the moon, but this may not be strictly true. Generally, wind, dampness, heat, and toxin congeal to form sores, hence it is called &quot;lunar erosion sore.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ear Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Some ask what happens when there is a toxic condition inside the ear. It is noted that conditions within the ear differ but are all due to wind and heat obstructing the foot Shaoyin and hand Shaoyang meridians. The symptoms can be classified into five types: </p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Tinnitus,&quot; also known as ear dampness, which frequently discharges yellow pus.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear wind toxin,&quot; which discharges red pus.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear entanglement,&quot; which discharges white pus.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear ulcer,&quot; associated with foul sores.</li>
<li>&quot;Ear tremor,&quot; characterized by a hollow ringing inside the ear, often discharging clear pus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though there are five types, they share a common root and none are associated with cold or heat. Conditions like ear fungus or ear hemorrhoids do not produce pus, are neither warm nor cold, and do not have swelling, but rather, there is a blockage in the ear. If these conditions persist, they can lead to deafness. Treatment involves drinks like &quot;Vitality Drink&quot; or &quot;Huanglian Detoxifying Drink.&quot; If there are alternating cold and heat symptoms, with internal and external redness and swelling, and increasing pain, it is classified as ear abscess. In such cases, &quot;Vitality Drink,&quot; combined with herbs like Shengma, Jiegeng, Zijingdan, and Wujindan, should be used. For strong patients, a single pill of gold pill can be administered. If there is severe cold and heat, with unbearable pain, it indicates a boil, which should be treated as such.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Medical Formulas Examined</h3>
<h4>On Ear Diseases</h4>
<p>The ear is responsible for hearing; if it cannot hear, it becomes deaf. A gentleman who has the responsibility of listening wisely would not allow this to happen. Thus, I examine the formulas. </p>
<p>For kidney heat, where there is pus and blood in the ear and one cannot hear human voices, the &quot;Thousand Gold Kidney Heat Decoction&quot; is the main treatment. The ear is an opening of the kidneys; therefore, when there is kidney heat, it causes ear ailments, leading to pus and bleeding, and one cannot hear. This formula uses magnetite to draw the metallic energy of the lungs down to the kidneys, allowing the kidneys to receive the maternal energy, which naturally clears the heat and improves the condition. The juices of raw rehmannia, Ophiopogon, and white peony root are used to nourish kidney yin and drain kidney heat. The green onion white parts are to guide the kidney energy upwards to the ears. The oyster is salty and cold, capable of softening hardness and breaking up stagnation. When combined with the green onion and applied to the ear, it opens the auditory passages and eliminates pus and blood. The rhizome of white atractylodes, licorice, and jujubes are ingredients that strengthen the spleen to nourish the maternal source of all, enhance earth energy, and control kidney evil. </p>
<p>For deafness due to labor, qi stagnation, wind, deficiency, toxins, prolonged conditions, and tinnitus, the &quot;Thousand Gold Kidney Tonifying Pill&quot; is the main remedy. Labor deafness occurs due to labor fire affecting the auditory passages; qi deafness results from stagnation in these passages; wind deafness arises when wind-heat obstructs the auditory pathways; deficiency deafness occurs from the exhaustion of qi and blood, leading to a lack of sensory responsiveness; toxic deafness results when pus and blood obstruct the auditory pathways; prolonged deafness ensues from illness persisting for a long time, causing evil energy to accumulate. Generally, any instance of deafness is likely accompanied by tinnitus; thus, it all relates back to the condition of tinnitus.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For thirty years, I have been deaf. I used thirty pounds of old iron, soaked in seven dou of water for three days, to extract the juice, and added it to seven dou of rice for brewing, following the usual method of making wine. After it ripens, I took one pound of magnetite, ground it into powder, and soaked it in the wine for three days. Then, I drank it to become intoxicated, wrapped the magnetite in cotton, placed it in my ear, and lay down with my head covered. When I sobered up, I removed the magnetite, and my hearing was restored. It is said that magnetite attracts iron, and this reflects the mutual influence of similar substances. The nature of metals and stones is cold, which can dispel internal heat; their heavy nature can help calm and expel qi. By brewing it in the wine, it is desired that there is no place it does not affect. After drinking the wine, placing the magnetite in the ear aims for a mutual interaction of internal and external sensations, allowing hearing to resume. </p>
<p>For treating ear pus, one can use ash from burned human hair. Each time, a small amount is blown into the ear to effect a cure.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ear Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Ear diseases are caused by the erratic movement of liver wind in the three burners. In adults, there is a distinction between deficiency heat and excess heat; in children, there is a difference between fetal heat and fetal wind. Deficiency heat manifests as a ringing sensation in the ear, possibly accompanied by hearing loss, itching due to fluid discharge, with no swelling externally; this indicates errant movement of deficiency heat. One should treat this with Four Substance Decoction plus peony root, sweet flag, and Kidney Qi Pill. Excess heat presents as swelling in the ear root and ear canal, and can lead to alternating chills and fever, with persistent pain; it is advisable to treat this with Chai Hu Qing Gan Decoction. If there is a blockage in the ear canal causing continuous pain, one should use Gardenia Qing Gan Decoction for treatment, and externally insert a yellow line medicine beside the blocked tissue until it is resolved. For children with fetal heat, bathing or washing water entering the ear canal can also cause ear pain and pus formation; initially, there is no need to apply medicine for early stages, and if swelling occurs in the neck, one should wait for the toxin to subside naturally. If it does not heal by the end of the month, it should be treated with Hong Mian San, and all will be well.</p>
<p><strong>Insects Entering the Ear</strong></p>
<p>Insects entering the ear happen occasionally, such as flies or small worms. To remove them, place a few drops of sesame oil into the ear canal; the insect will die and can be extracted. For larger insects like centipedes that enter, heat fragrant meat near the ear; the insect will emerge due to the smell. If an insect enters in the dark at night, do not panic or shout, as this may push the insect further in. Instead, sit upright, light a lamp, and direct the light toward the ear canal; the insect, seeing the light, will come out. If there is someone else present, the insect may not come out.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Black Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>The black carbuncle occurs within the ear canal, appearing as a black hard lump that decays and bleeds. It causes pain in the jaw and cheek. It is advisable to first use a needle to pierce it, followed by inducing sweating, while still treating it according to carbuncle guidelines.<br>— Medical Texts of the Medical Profession [Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang]</p>
<p><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>The human body has nine orifices: seven are yang orifices—namely the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth; two are yin orifices—these are the front and rear openings. When yang energy moves outward through the orifices and descends to the yin areas, symptoms such as urinary issues and abdominal sounds arise. Conversely, when yin energy moves downward through the orifices and rises to the yang areas, symptoms such as blocked ear ringing occur. </p>
<p>After the age of fifty, kidney energy gradually weakens; this often causes a reversal of yang energy. Since the kidney orifice opens to the ears and ear hearing is governed by the kidneys, which are responsible for storage and do not wish to leak externally, the liver, as the mother of wood, disperses the motherly energy outward. Thus, when thoughts and emotions cause an upsurge of fire and the yin energy reverses upwards, the ear orifice becomes blocked and unclear. Therefore, one can still hear without obstruction but may find distant sounds slightly impaired. Generally, this occurs in older individuals. </p>
<p>In contrast to deafness, which is more profound, deafness involves a membrane in the orifice that blocks external air from entering. Thus, the primary treatment is to open the orifices, with formulas containing ingredients like Acorus gramineus and musk, as well as external and internal remedies, designed specifically for this issue.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Regarding old age, the yin energy does not naturally gather and is said to overflow from the upper orifices; no one has mentioned this principle. Instead, treatments for the hearing of the young and for dispersing energy are applied, combined with remedies for yin deficiency, resulting in almost no effectiveness. They do not realize that the yin energy reaching the upper orifices is also separated by a membrane and cannot escape outside, only producing sounds within, akin to the croaking of frogs or the buzzing of mosquitoes, incessantly reverberating. Thus, external sounds mix with internal sounds, rendering the hearing unclear. If the energy slightly does not reverse upwards, the hearing becomes somewhat clearer; if the energy does not reverse upwards at all, the hearing becomes entirely clear. If one understands this principle, there can be extraordinary results in treating the upward reversing energy of the elderly. The essence of the treatment involves using magnetism as the main focus, as it can effectively pull downwards and suppress the upward aspect of the liver&#39;s wood energy. Additionally, it employs herbs like rehmannia and tortoise shell to support yin, along with the sourness of schisandra and cornelian cherry to gather it, ensuring that the yin energy thrives in its source without ascending to disturb the yang orifices, thus remaining unobstructed. Just as ears receive sound like valleys absorbing echoes, even amidst various sounds, one can still listen carefully; how could one struggle to hear distant human voices? This is indeed the underlying truth, but those with shallow medical knowledge cannot comprehend it.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Try to observe that when a person collects their sight, it becomes clearer, and when they return to listen, they become more astute; then one can understand that these words are not mere speculation. Although the orifices of the two kidneys open at the ears, the kidney energy rises to the ear&#39;s edge, blocked by a membrane, preventing it from exceeding the ear&#39;s boundaries. It is confined below the roots of the ears, producing faint sounds if little and loud sounds if much, to the extent that the muscles around the ear may twitch as if piercing through the outer ear; nevertheless, it cannot actually escape. If the yin energy could exit the ears and traverse the yang orifices, then yin and yang would be mixed, which contradicts the principles of the Three Powers. Thus, the function of the ears is remarkably subtle; they are empty and receptive. The external energies vary in size; when they reach the ears, they encounter no obstruction, but the internal energies resonate audibly, hence the external energies only penetrate halfway. If the fire of pent-up anger stirs, the internal energy increases, blending with the external energy; then the internal energy gradually flows downward, restoring the upper orifices to their empty and receptive state, allowing sounds to enter clearly and unobstructed.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classical text indicates that the ailments related to the lesser yang gallbladder and the jueyin liver channels are largely due to excess heat, particularly affecting the left ear. However, the qi of the lesser yang can ascend to the orifices, with its acupoints all connecting to the crown of the head. There is no reason to conflate it with the jueyin. The Tongsheng Powder, which is used for sweating and purging, is a method for treating vigorous fire. Danxi&#39;s herbal choices are not clearly documented; however, the Rolling Phlegm Pill, particularly effective for the young, uses rhubarb, Scutellaria, and sandalwood which are not bitter but can descend qi effectively. The weight of calamine stone is somewhat analogous to the use of a magnet. Chang refrains from using this remedy because it significantly damages the spleen and stomach and depletes the vital energy within the chest. </p>
<p>As for ear ringing due to kidney deficiency, it is linked to the bladder&#39;s fire rising, where yang fire can infiltrate the orifices and cause the ringing. This is further unsupported in Danxi&#39;s claims. The Book of Changes states there is fire within water, implying that the true fire is a small point of genuine yang within the K’an. For elderly individuals, kidney water is prone to depletion, making genuine fire easier to reveal, and thus the qi within the kidneys tends to escape and is hard to gather again. One might question whether the jueyin’s offspring could assist in this. It is optimal to strengthen the water element to control the yang fire, akin to adding oil to a lamp to keep the flame small; this is indeed a good method. If there are claims about ineffective treatments for kidney deficiency, it is clear that these are generalized observations and not specifically applicable to the elderly. Gathering and securing kidney qi are fundamentally the priorities for the elderly, so would Danxi, known for his wisdom, truly engage in such discussions?<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Complete Book of Jingyue</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jieben)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Regarding deafness, although various schools have discussed it, in my view, there are primarily five types of symptoms: Fire Closure, Qi Stagnation, Pathogenic Closure, Orifice Closure, and Deficiency Closure. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Fire Closure</strong> arises from the obstruction of the clear pathways by the fire element in the channels. Its symptoms include a sensation of roaring or heat, swelling, tightness, agitation, or warmth, potentially accompanied by redness in the face. For this condition, treatment should focus on clearing the fire, as clearing the fire will naturally resolve the closure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Qi Stagnation</strong> typically results from the rebellious flow of liver and gallbladder qi, characterized by symptoms that are neither deficient nor fiery, often stemming from anger or melancholy, leading to qi stagnation. The treatment should aim to regulate the qi, as smooth qi will relax the heart and lead to the resolution of the closure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pathogenic Closure</strong> is caused by external factors such as wind or cold affecting the body&#39;s protective mechanisms. Treatment should focus on dispersing these pathogenic influences to restore normal function.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Orifice Closure</strong> usually occurs due to trauma or injury, such as lacerations or damage from loud noises, or persistent ear issues leading to discharge and deterioration of the orifice. This condition should be addressed with methods that promote opening and restoration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these types requires a specific approach to treatment based on their underlying causes and characteristics.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who suffer from deafness may do so due to aging, illness, or excessive fatigue, leading to the depletion of essence and kidney deficiency, which results in gradual hearing loss. It is essential to strengthen the foundation in order to remedy this condition. </p>
<p>Generally, there are cases where the problem cannot be reached externally, and the illness resides within the channels; in contrast, some cases cannot be resolved internally, indicating a problem with the organs. Each should be treated according to its specific nature, and there will inevitably be cures. However, sudden deafness is often easier to treat, while long-lasting deafness is much more challenging to remedy.</p>
<p>The condition of deafness is generally due to obstructed qi not reaching the ears. Indeed, various pathogenic factors like fire or wind can cause qi stagnation, leading to obstruction. Anger causes qi to rebel, which also leads to obstruction. Injury to the orifices can obstruct qi, consequently resulting in closure. Weakness leads to insufficient qi circulation, and insufficient flow leads to obstruction. In general, real obstruction occurs when pathogenic factors are prevalent and qi is rebelling, while virtual obstruction occurs when qi is insufficient. However, true obstruction is rare, while virtual obstruction is common. Furthermore, any condition associated with strong pathogenic influence typically causes deafness and, if the proper qi is robust, it should not reach this point.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Only when the vital energy is insufficient can the evil energy seize it; this is precisely where the true and the false converge, and this energy must be regarded as empty. Therefore, even when the illness manifests as deafness and closure due to real evil, it still carries the appearance of deficiency. Thus, in treating this condition, it is unwise to forcefully attack it, similar to the ancient methods that use Tongsheng San, Shen Xiong Wan, Liang Ge San, and Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan; these should not be used lightly. This is because attacking may not necessarily lead to recovery and could harm the spleen and stomach, resulting in further complications. In treating this, any fire obstruction above should be cleared and lowered; for those with yin deficiency, it should also be supplemented, as this is the treatment for yang conditions. If there is no fire evil, but only qi obstruction, one may either supplement or open up, but one must include warming and pungent remedies to facilitate passage; this is the treatment for yin conditions. Nonetheless, both approaches should be gradually adjusted, avoiding haste, to achieve the best outcomes.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Tinnitus should be discerned between the true and the false: Generally, loud and abrupt sounds are often due to excess, while soft and gradual sounds are more likely due to deficiency. For younger individuals with heat in the body, it tends to be excess; for those in middle age with no heat, it tends to be deficiency. Drinking rich alcoholic beverages and having thick flavors often leads to phlegm and heat, indicating excess, while having a clear quality and fine pulse often points to fatigue and deficiency. Additionally, the ears are the orifice of the kidneys, where the ancestral essence converges. When the vital energy is balanced and kidney energy is sufficient, the ears and eyes are sharp; if labor exhausts the blood and energy, leading to a depletion of essence and weakness of the kidneys, deafness will inevitably result. Therefore, after middle age, many people experience tinnitus that resembles the sound of wind, rain, cicadas, or tides, which is indicative of the decline of yin and deficiency of the kidneys. The classics state: &quot;At forty, the yin energy is already half, which signifies decline.&quot; Furthermore, referring to the &quot;I Ching,&quot; its symbolism is particularly relevant. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;Kan represents the ear,&quot; suggesting that the yang of Kan dwells in the center, and the clarity of the ear resides within, hence their correspondence. Nowadays, elderly individuals often have ears that do not hear internally but sound externally, which is precisely a sign of weakened kidney essence and gradually diminishing yang energy. Seeking recovery is indeed difficult, yet merely finding a way to ease the situation would be fortunate. Ultimately, proper nourishment and daily cultivation of the fundamentals are essential.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>When there is a strong fire resulting in tinnitus and ear blockage, one should carefully assess the nuances of the fire&#39;s intensity and the strength or weakness of the body, and then correspondingly clear or subdue it. For excessive fire, one should use methods such as withdrawing fuel, administering large quantities of clearing drinks, or employing formulas like Danggui Longhui Pills. For mild fire, shifting to lighter drinks is appropriate; if there is also a deficiency in yin, one should add or reduce with a Yin Decoction or Clearing Transformation Drink; if phlegm is present, a Clearing Barrier Drink should be used.</p>
<p>If there is upward-acting qi causing blockage, one should use Liu&#39;an Decoction with the addition of Xiangfu, Danpi, Houpo, and Zhi Ke. In cases where qi is reversed along with fire, the addition of Shan Zhi, Longdancao, or Tianhuafen is advisable. If there is upward qi combined with wind and cold, one should add Chuanxiong, Xixin, Suye, Changpu, Manjingzi, and Chaihu.</p>
<p>For exogenous cold damage leading to fever, headache, and unrelieved deafness, one should examine and treat according to the cold damage category, as resolving the pathogen will lead to the natural healing of the ears. However, deafness from cold damage, although classified under the Shaoyang syndrome, must arise from deficiency; thus, Zhongjing also acknowledged it as a deficiency of yang energy.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, whenever encountering this syndrome, one must focus on nourishing the vital energy. If there are pathologies present, they should also dissipate the pathogenic factors, and one can assess the condition&#39;s progression based on the heaviness or lightness of the deafness. If the hearing gradually improves, the illness will likely recover; if the deafness worsens, the condition will certainly deteriorate. If there is complete deafness with no sound perceived at all, it indicates the essence of the kidneys has been utterly exhausted, which is an extremely ominous sign.</p>
<p>In the case of deafness due to deficiency, all twelve meridians have their respective influences, but the liver and kidneys are the most crucial. For the elderly who are weak or those with congenital Yin deficiency, it is advisable to use tonifying formulas such as &quot;Great Nourishing Yuan Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Left Return Pill,&quot; &quot;Right Return Pill,&quot; &quot;Cistanche Pill,&quot; or &quot;Decoction of Complete Nutrients&quot; to treat them. </p>
<p>If the deafness arises from excessive worry and contemplation, it is appropriate to use calming remedies like &quot;Calming the Heart Pill&quot; or &quot;Mercury and Aromatic Powder.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is Yang deficiency in the upper body, formulas such as &quot;Middle Tonifying and Qi Invigorating Decoction&quot; or &quot;Returning the Spleen Decoction&quot; should be used. Among various tonics, one may consider adding herbs like Chuanxiong, Acorus, Polygala, Asarum, Schizonepeta, or Bupleurum as needed. However, when the deficiency and blockage have persisted for a long time, recovery is difficult.</p>
<p>In cases of blockage affecting the orifices, the disease results from issues with Qi and blood, and treatment should aim to unblock these pathways.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Deafness is a disease of the kidney meridian. In principle, it should be treated with Liuwei Dihuang Wan (Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill), adding five qian of Chaihu (Bupleurum), two liang each of Ganju (sweet chrysanthemum) and Baishao (white peony), three liang each of Danggui (angelica) and Gouqi (goji berries), and three qian of Beiwuweizi (five-flavored) as well. However, instead of this, one uses a rat&#39;s gallbladder, one piece, along with one fen each of Longchi (dragon tooth), Bingpian (borneol), Musk, and Zhushā (cinnabar), half a fen each of Ruxiang (frankincense) and Chaosha (amber). Grind them into an extremely fine powder, form into pills the size of a nut using human milk, and wrap them in silk wadding. They should not be too large and must be inserted deep into the ear until it can no longer be tolerated. After three days, remove them, and the hearing will be restored, never to be deaf again; three pills are not necessary. </p>
<p>However, acquiring the rat&#39;s gallbladder is quite difficult. One should find a large rat, first raise it in a bamboo cage, then use paper to create a box that lures it to hide inside, placing food inside so it eats. After some time, suddenly strike it on the head to kill it, and immediately obtain the gallbladder; it is located in the liver, otherwise, it cannot be acquired again. If it is dried, it can still be used; just dissolve it in water, and mix it into the medicinal powder. This method is indeed effective for those with true deafness. </p>
<p>Additionally, one can use a grain of pearl, with one fen of Longgu (dragon bone) powdered, mixed with honey to form a pill over the pearl, wrapping it in powdered cinnabar before inserting it; this is also a miraculous method. After a month, take it out and then use a dose of Liuwei Dihuang Wan to ensure that one will never be deaf again.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Itchy Ears</h3>
<p>When one experiences itchiness in the ears, using a wooden splinter is not sufficient to soothe the itch. One must use an iron tool to pierce it deeply, producing a clear sound, before one can feel relief; otherwise, the itch can be unbearably intense. This is due to the fire from the kidneys and liver, which forms an iron-like substance in the ears, and cannot be treated with simple herbal remedies. I have devised a prescription: use one qian of dragon bone, one stalk of soap pod, burn them to ash while retaining their properties, three fen of borneol, and one male mouse gall. First, grind the initial ingredients into a fine powder, then mix with the mouse gall in water, and finally blend with human milk until it resembles thick paste. This mixture should be thoroughly applied into the ear canal; the itch will be overwhelming, and one must have someone hold their hands down until the itch subsides and self-healing occurs. After recovery, one may take thirty jin of Liuwei Wan.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

First, boil the oil until bubbling, then add the disarrayed materials until dissolved; next, add the prepared powders and boil until golden brown, filtering out the residue multiple times with cotton, and simmer gently again. Finally, incorporate the frankincense and yellow wax, stirring to achieve the desired consistency, and store in a ceramic container. Apply using a goose feather.</p>
<p>Another formula: Use two taels each of the white bark from the mulberry, elm, and apricot, soaked in almond broth to remove the skins; one tael of licorice; and half a jin of sheep&#39;s brain marrow, all chopped. Boil the sheep&#39;s brain marrow until yellow and filter out the residue, storing in a ceramic container. Use a goose feather daily to dip into the medicine for application.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Translation of the Classical Chinese text:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Classic of the Western Mountains: On the mountain of Fuyu, there is a tree named Wenjing, whose fruit is like a jujube and can cure deafness. </p>
<p>In the midst of Yin Mountain, there are many hawthorns, whose leaves resemble those of elm and are square-shaped, and whose fruit is like red beans; eating them can also cure deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When deafness occurs due to a sudden disturbance, the eyes and ears become unclear; use sky windows. </p>
<p>Pathogenic factors on the Yangming meridian of the hand can cause ear deafness, making one unable to hear sounds. Insert needles into the fingernail of the index finger and the thumb, removing the needle as one would with chive leaves, puncturing each once for effectiveness; if there is no immediate effect, insert into the fingernail of the middle finger where it meets the flesh for immediate effect. If there is still no response, do not insert again. If wind is generated in the ear, use the same method of puncturing several times, moving from left to right, then right to left. To alleviate ear deafness through the Yangming meridian, if not resolved, puncture the pathway leading to the front of the ear.</p>
<p>Pathogenic factors affecting the Taiyin and Shaoyin of the hands and feet are related to the Yangming meridian; these five meridians all converge in the ear, with connections to the left angle. When all five meridians become blocked, it causes the body’s qi to stir, leaving one in a state of unawareness, resembling a corpse, or some may say, a state of corpse-like stupor. Puncture the inner side of the toenail of the big toe, leaving it punctured as one would with chive leaves; then puncture the center of the foot; next, puncture the toenail of the middle toe, each once; then puncture the inner side of the thumb, as one would with chive leaves; finally, puncture the heart point of the Shaoyin where the sharp bone ends, each once, for immediate effect; if still unresolved, blow into both ears with a bamboo tube, take one inch of hair from the left angle, burn it, and drink a cup of fine wine. If one cannot drink, administer it forcefully for immediate effect.&quot;<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p></div>

One should treat using the channels of Jueyin and Shaoyang; if the qi is rebellious, symptoms include headaches, deafness, and facial swelling, and one should draw blood.</p>
<p>For those with lung disease, if deficient, there is shortness of breath, an inability to exhale fully, deafness, and a dry throat; one should treat using the channels of Taiyin, on the foot of Shaoyang externally, and Jueyin internally to draw blood.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When there is ringing in the ears, what qi causes this? Qibo replied: The ears are where the ancestral vessels gather. Therefore, when the stomach is empty, the ancestral vessels become deficient, and if deficient, they flow downwards, leading to a deficiency in the vessels, hence the ringing in the ears. Nourish both the host and the guest; it is at the junction of the thumb&#39;s nail and flesh.</p>

It is also said: The hand&#39;s sun channel affects the shoulder, hip, and neck, causing pain and ringing in the ears. If the pain twists the muscles, treatment lies in the moxibustion and needling based on knowledge and pain. Diseases arising from the hand&#39;s sun meridian manifest as deafness, yellowing of the eyes, and swollen cheeks. Adjust for excessive heat or cold that is deficient and sinking. In cases of febrile illness with heaviness, bone pain, deafness, and desire for sleep, target the bones with the fourth needle, using fifty-nine punctures. Bone ailments that prevent eating, with enamel-like ears deepening to green, seek the bones in the kidneys, but refrain from drawing from the earth; scholars correspond to the spleen.

<p>For neck pain and inability to turn, with unclear vision, the wind pool controls it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of deafness often involves complaints of tinnitus, yet in reality, it is a form of deafness governed by the Pathway of the Fen. Tinnitus is linked to the arterial movement in front of the ear. </p>
<p>For deafness without pain, focus on the Lesser Yang at the foot; for deafness with pain, the Yangming at the hand is indicated. Tinnitus is governed by points like Baihui, Yanyan, Lusi, Tiankuang, Daling, Pianli, Qianggu, and Houxi. Ear pain with deafness is related to Shangguan, with the admonition to not pierce deeply.</p>
<p>For deafness and tinnitus, the points Xiaguan alongside Yangxi, Guanchong, Yumen, and Yanggu should be considered. If deafness and tinnitus coincide with pain in the head or jaw, the point Ermen is significant. </p>
<p>Should there be heaviness in the head and pain in the jaw, drawing to the ear, with sounds like chirping or buzzing, the Hejiao point is of relevance. </p>
<p>In cases of deafness with sounds resembling wind or frenzy in the ear, the Tinghui point should be applied. If there is an emptiness in hearing that feels as if nothing is heard, leading to a continuous noise akin to cicadas, the Tingong point should be noted, with the emphasis on the lower jaw much like a broken sound piercing through this condition.</p>
<p>For deafness without hearing, focus on the Tianshu point. If there is clamor without discernible hearing, Tiansheng is the place of focus.</p>
<p>When wind arises within the ear, leading to both tinnitus and deafness during non-hearing times, focus on the Shangyang point. For conditions of deafness and blockage within the ear, the Hegu point is to be utilized.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

<p>For ear pain radiating to the ear, with a buzzing sound where there is no hearing, consider Wangu, Yanggu, Jianzheng, Qiaoyin, and Xiaxi. </p>
<p>For wind-related deafness buzzing, utilize Shangyang, inserting a needle to a depth of one portion, leaving one breath, and moxibustion three times. Alternate sides as if eating. </p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: for deafness and tinnitus, with either pain or itchiness, or a feeling of fullness, use the point Tinghui. The acupoint is located in the depression at the front of the ear lobe, apply eight draining and suction techniques. </p>

<p>For sudden deafness, use a moxa stick on the ear with the herb Atractylodes, cut into seven parts—one end flat and the other pointed. Insert the pointed end into the ear and moxa the flat end for seven times; if the condition is severe, do it for fourteen times. When you feel heat inside the ear, it is effective. The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; says that for wind-related deafness, moxa seven times at the point Shang Xing to allow the qi to flow into the ear, which can lead to recovery. </p>
<p>For ear deafness and pain, use moxa seven times. For deafness, moxa at He Gu point seven times; or at Wai Guan, Ting Gong, Shen Shu, and Pian Li. The &quot;Treasure Mirror of Eastern Medicine&quot; states that for ear buzzing, select points such as Ye Men, Er Men, Zhong Zhu, Shang Guan, Wan Gu, Lin Qi, Yang Gu, Qian Gu, Hou Xi, Yang Xi, Pian Li, He Gu, Da Ling, Tai Xi, and Jin Men. </p>
<p>For ear deafness, use points Zhong Zhu, Wai Guan, He Liao, Ting Hui, Ting Gong, He Gu, Shang Yang, and Zhong Chong. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: Engage in deep breathing to block distractions, clench your teeth, press your nostrils tightly with two fingers, and open your eyes wide, allowing your breath to connect your ears and clear your passages. You may feel a buzzing sound inside; practice this for two or three days until your passages are open. Regularly listen with both ears in order to return to a quiet state. You can also hold your breath, closing your mouth and nostrils, and imagine the breath coming out of your ears, then draw your focus back; your ears will naturally become sharp. For ear ailments, rub the palms of your hands together fifty times, applying heat to the ear to open it, and continue this rubbing and observing for six repetitions. Symptoms will improve, and with ongoing practice, results will be evident. Use mental focus to disperse heat; for men, gather it back between the kidneys, and for women, draw it back beneath the breasts or to the ears. You can press the ear area, and if you hear a buzzing, swallow saliva to calm the energy within. </p>
<p>For ear pain, visualize fire burning the kidneys, and cleanse it with kidney water; press the ear several times to stimulate sound, swallow saliva, and breathe down until you feel at ease. For ear problems, use your mind to scatter the heat, drawing it back and storing it within the kidneys, or if something is lodged in the ear, mentally remove it. </p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jing Yue&quot; states: If the ear passages are damaged, blocked, or injured, leading to sudden deafness or persistent buzzing, gently press your fingertip against the ear opening, pushing and releasing in rhythm. This should be done several times; the air will flow, and when it does, the passage will naturally open. If these conditions occur, failing to take timely action may result in gradual blockage, ultimately leading to complete ear closure.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Danqian Xulu,&quot; Wang Wanli suffered from ear pain at that time. Wei Wenjing Gong advised him to take a potion made of blue salt and deer antler decoction. He mentioned that this medicine was not for consumption due to deficiency, and asked why one shouldn’t consider the &quot;I Ching,&quot; where &quot;Kan&quot; corresponds to the ear. The Kan water resides in the kidney, opening the orifice at the ear. In terms of emotion, it relates to fear; fear injures the kidney, hence the ear pain. The movement of Qi Yang is always evident, while the flow of Blood Yin is often hidden. Blood, like water between heaven and earth, leads to Kan being the hexagram of blood, indicating disease is already documented in the classics. In the end, after taking it, he was cured.</p>
<p>Shen Cunzhong stated: When I was an inspection official in Hebei, I suffered from red eyes for more than forty days. The black part of my eyes was darkened and developed sores, causing pain day and night. Various treatments failed to heal me. The gentleman Qiu Ge, upon seeing my condition, asked if my ears had been itchy. If they were itchy, it would indicate kidney wind. There is a formula called Si Sheng San to treat kidney wind, and it typically takes two or three doses to heal, known locally as the &quot;sacred powder.&quot; I transmitted the formula and took it as directed: one dose at noon and one before sleeping. My eyes began to hurt greatly, and I could only sleep at the second watch; upon waking, my eyes had slightly improved and were no longer painful. After taking three or four more doses, I returned to normal health. At that time, Scholar Sun Hefu was in charge and, upon hearing me, was overjoyed, saying: &quot;I now know how to treat the eyes myself.&quot; Earlier, suffering from a long-term eye ailment, I once heard Lu Jifu, a political advisor, say that after a prolonged eye illness, he healed himself by taking the Tou Bing Dan (Icing Pill). Following his recommendation, I tried taking two or three dozen doses, and my eyes were cured, leading me to realize that the Tou Bing Dan also treats kidney wind in the ears.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Sacred Benefit&quot; states: If someone experiences itchy ears that occur daily, it is a cause for concern. Poking at it until it bleeds may bring slight relief. This indicates kidney deficiency, leading to a floating toxin ascending, which is not easily treated by conventional methods. It is advisable to take &#39;Ice-Clear Pill&#39; and avoid alcohol and damp vegetables, chicken, and pork for at least a month for the best results; if one cannot abstain, treatment will be ineffective.</p>
<p>&quot;Notes from Ink Visitors&quot;: Creatures that can enter the ear are not just earwigs; such as wall lice, fireflies, head-banging bugs, and soap pods can also cause harm. I have a distant relative who had a bug enter his ear, convinced he would surely die, and thus squandered his family&#39;s resources over several years, leading to his financial ruin. When the bug came out, he discovered it was a head-banging bug. Another individual had an earwig enter his ear; in a peak moment of distress, he unconsciously banged his head against a pillar, causing him to bleed without realizing it, claiming the itch was unbearable. Earwigs often consume marrow and can breed in the winter. For any bug in the ear, the best remedy is to flush it out with raw oil.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: The late emperor once had a bug crawl into his ear while sleeping, causing intense pain. He took ginger and rubbed it on a cat&#39;s nose, and its urine came out. He then dripped that urine into his ear, and the bug came out, resulting in a cure. Zhang Jin, a hundred households, said to me: When there is a sore in the ear that causes periodic severe pain, one may feel as though they want to die, yet when the pain subsides, it feels the same as before, and upon diagnosing the pulse, all seems calm. I deduced it was not a sore. Suddenly, the pain arose, and I suspected a bug had entered the ear. I instructed him to turn back, quickly took the cat&#39;s urine and dripped it into the ear, which caused a stinky bug to come out, and thereafter there was no more pain. Some use hemp oil to drip in, but the bug dies and is hard to remove. Others use fried sesame to treat it, and the bug also comes out, but neither method is as quick as using cat urine.</p>
<p>Wen Xuan’s Yao Haishan had a red swollen ear root with cold and hot pains, indicating wind heat from the sanjiao. However, with pre-existing deficiency of the central qi, I added Gardenia fruit, fried Scutellaria, and Burdock seed to tonify the middle and benefit qi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A scholar, due to anger, experienced pain in the ear accompanied by fluid discharge. Using wind-dispersing medicine caused muscle spasms and pain, and limbs felt constrained. This was a result of liver fire injuring the blood. I used the Six Flavor Pill, and after several doses, he recovered.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a></p></div>

Pressing on it would slightly relieve the pain, but anger caused swelling and pain in the chest, sides, and breasts, along with alternating chills and fever, frequent urination, and abdominal distension.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had swelling and pain in her ear, experiencing chills and fever, with a bitter taste in her mouth, ear discharge, and a hot sensation radiating to her neck, along with reduced appetite and thought. This indicated severe liver fire damaging the spleen. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added San Zhi (gardenia fruit) and Mu Dan Pi (peony root), which brought slight improvement.

<p>A widow had pain in her ear, or exterior ear pain, or a hard lump on the side of her neck, with internal heat characterized by afternoon fevers, irregular menstruation, little saliva and phlegm, and hindered chest.

<p>Taiqing Wei Zhuang Qu, in the winter of the year Gui Mao, had ear pain, with the left pulse being large and slippery. I said: this is due to kidney essence depletion, unable to nourish the liver wood, so it is necessary to moisten the source of transformation. He did not believe this and continued to mix other tonifying medicines. I told his son-in-law Lu Shi Ruo that if Zhuang Qu could not nourish kidney essence, he would surely not survive until spring. The following year, on the 18th day of late spring, he sought treatment again. He was lethargic and unable to speak, with pus already forming in the audiophore, and also had reduced bowel movements. Only then did he believe my words. He sought treatment but was unable to. I used Liu Wei Wan, which is a remedy, and his penis retracted, his urination decreased from ten to six or seven times, and his mind quickly regained clarity. I said: if we let the pus out, we might extend a few days for the continuation of descendants; otherwise, if the pus comes from the ear, death is imminent. Some said that if we don’t let it out, he might survive, so I excused myself and left. The next day, pus indeed came from his ear, and by the 21st day of the Jiwei Fire day, he passed away.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with the addition of Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Platycodon for four doses, and the swelling subsided. Then I used Tori Xiaodu San for several doses; the pulse became slippery and rapid, indicating that pus had formed. It was advisable to use acupuncture, but he was afraid and unwilling. Only after the pain became severe did I insert the needle, yielding about a bowl of pus, and after using the Tori medicine for over two months, he began to recover. </p>
<p>For sores that do not break, one must provoke them to burst; if they do not form pus, one must nourish to encourage formation, preventing internal damage. Pus that has formed must be punctured promptly; recovery can occur within a few days. Patients often fear the pain of needles and hesitate to use them, also worrying about injuring healthy flesh, yet they do not realize that although sores may occur in thin flesh, once pus has formed, the swelling can be over an inch high, and the skin of the sore is thick. The needle should not go deeper than two tenths of an inch. If the swelling is on the back, it can rise three to four inches, with needle insertion limited to about an inch, especially since the flesh at the affected site is already damaged—what pain is there to fear? What harm to anticipate? </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person becomes angry, they may experience swelling under the ear or pain in the side. Using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Qingpi, Honghua, and Taoren can bring recovery.</p>
<p>A woman who is quick to anger often has swelling and pain under the ear, with alternating chills and fever, and tightness in the liver pulse. Administering Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Qingpi, Burdock Seed, Jingjue, and Fangfeng can alleviate the chills and fever. Additionally, several doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with Siwu Decoction will reduce the swelling. Her father wanted to eliminate the root of the illness, and I advised that the liver is responsible for storing blood internally and nourishing the tendons externally. If anger causes qi to rebel, it can damage the liver, which governs the tendons, resulting in swelling and knots. She needs to manage herself to avoid further issues. Otherwise, the rebelling liver will fail to store blood, and blood deficiency makes recovery difficult. Later, she did not take precautions and developed three lumps; despite frequent treatment, they persisted and eventually led to her demise.</p>
<p>A man who had traveled far, experiencing fatigue and fever, with a weak and large pulse and swelling under the ear, suffered from labor-induced damage. He should have taken the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; to naturally reverse the heat and reduce swelling. However, he did not listen and instead took antipyretic medicines and strong dispersants, ultimately leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and death from not eating. Fatigue depletes qi, and when qi is weak, fire becomes strong, leading to fatigue and heat; this is an injury to the original qi. Danxi stated that one should replenish the physical qi and regulate the meridians, allowing wounds to resolve on their own; one should not sweat or purge. If one does not carefully assess the pulse and symptoms related to meridian illnesses but hastily uses harsh remedies, the risk of danger is significant.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the hairline behind the ear, there was a swelling without a head, flesh-colored with slight pain upon pressure. I believed it to be phlegm causing a soft pulse appearing intermittently. The classics state that a pulse that is rapid yet does not appear intermittently indicates a sore rather than phlegm. Zhongjing says that a weak pulse denotes a deficiency in both blood and qi, and that there is insufficient essence and form. It further states that a sinking, slow, and weak pulse should all be treated with tonics. Thus, I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, Sichuan lovage, and fried licorice to tonify, adding a little honeysuckle, white peony, and platycodon to dispel toxins. They disagreed, suggesting internal consumption to clear heat and resolve phlegm, and applying cooling medicines externally; however, they felt chilled to the bone while the affected area was very hot, leading to increasing heaviness in the head and decreasing appetite. Upon further consultation, I prescribed Four Gentlemen Decoction with added aromatic cardamom and toasted dried ginger over several doses, gradually increasing food intake. When pus formed, it was needled, and then I applied Ten Full Great Tonic Decoction minus cassia, and moxibustion with fermented soybean cake, eventually leading to recovery after over a month.</p>
<p>Luo Zongbo experienced painful swelling behind the ear with a rapid pulse. I treated him with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction enhanced with platycodon, burdock seeds, and honeysuckle over four doses, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another individual had a toxic infection over an inch behind the ear, with a solid pulse indicating a need for internal Huanglian Decoction; however, due to the severe winter, he refused cold medicines and ultimately did not recover.</p>
<p>A third individual had a toxic infection at the edge of the hair approximately an inch behind the ear, diagnosed as a sharp sore, causing burning pain and alternating chills and fevers, along with restlessness and a preference for coolness. This was due to heat stagnating in the gallbladder channel. Initially, I prescribed Shenxian Huo Ming Decoction, which reduced the intensity significantly by two-thirds. However, given the mid-winter conditions, he was wary of using cooling agents and instead took ten doses of the tonifying medicine, leading to a worsening condition; pus erupted in the ear, the throat became swollen and obstructed, and he was unable to swallow the medicine, resulting in death.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Meaningful Grasses&quot; states: Wang Yu originally experienced a感证 (a sensation or feeling) many years ago, and due to poor treatment, all the bodily fluids were consumed by evil heat. After more than ten years, the heat had not dissipated, and the right ear canal was often blocked. This summer, he fell ill again, enduring for more than fifty days with swelling of the face and feet, unable to sleep peacefully. Air from the ear was in contact with the outside, indicating that new heat had combined with old heat, making the situation more troublesome, therefore difficult to eliminate from the body. The physicians did not observe the binding and entangled nature of his condition, and their treatment was ineffective. As autumn deepened, with the cold of metal and water, the illness started to recede. However, while mild symptoms may retreat, severe ones cannot quickly dissipate. The swelling of the face and feet indicates that the lung&#39;s metal energy is obstructed by heat, losing its ability to descend and clear. Inability to sleep peacefully indicates that the fluids in the stomach are dry, unable to nourish the spirit. The gas striking out from the ear suggests a long-blocked canal, with air coming without sensation. Now, with the body weak and emaciated, there is no obstruction, and the gas reverses and surges upwards, making him aware of it. Although the external illness may have improved, internal adjustments through diet and medicine still occupy half of the condition. Especially focusing on two matters, the general principle is that those who become ill must understand the methods for post-illness recovery. It is necessary to realize that after falling ill, the body&#39;s vital energy has already weakened, and the evil heat within has not cleared. Thus, to restore the deficiency, the heat cannot be eliminated; and to clear the heat, the deficiency cannot be sustained. Therefore, if one aims for half to tonify deficiency and half to clear heat, it ultimately leads to confusion, lacking clear understanding. However, apart from tonifying deficiency and clearing heat, there is no other method, and one must carefully discern this. There are two methods of tonifying deficiency: one is to tonify the spleen, and the other is to tonify the stomach.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>如疟痢后脾气衰弱，饮食不能运化，宜补其脾；伤寒后胃中津液久耗，新者未生，宜补其胃。二者有霄壤之殊也。清热亦有二法：初病之时，热为实热，宜用苦寒药清之；大病后之热为虚热，宜用甘寒药清之。二者亦霄壤之殊也。人身天真之气，全在胃口，津液不足即是虚，生津液即是补虚，故以生津之药，合甘寒泻热之药，而治感后之虚热，如麦门冬、生地黄、牡舟皮、人参、梨汁、竹沥之属皆为合法。仲景每用天水散以清虚热，正取滑石、甘草，一甘一寒之义也。<a id="orig-162p" href="#trans-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After the weakness of the spleen and qi following malaria or dysentery, if digestion is impeded, it is advisable to tonify the spleen; after an illness like typhoid, when the stomach&#39;s fluids have been depleted for a long time and new fluids have not yet been generated, it is necessary to tonify the stomach. The differences between these two cases are as vast as the sky and the earth. There are also two methods to clear heat: in the initial stages of illness, the heat is classified as excess heat, and it is appropriate to use bitter and cold herbs to clear it; however, after a severe illness, the heat becomes deficiency heat, so sweet and cold herbs should be used to clear it. Again, the distinctions between these two are as vast as the sky and the earth. The body&#39;s vital essence resides entirely in the stomach; if the fluids are insufficient, it indicates deficiency. Generating fluids indicates tonification, so remedies that generate fluids are combined with sweet and cold herbs that drain heat, which treats the deficiency heat following an illness. Herbs such as Ophiopogon root, Rehmannia root, Moutan bark, ginseng, pear juice, and bamboo sap are all appropriate for this purpose. Zhang Zhongjing frequently used Tianshui powder to clear deficiency heat, specifically selecting talc and licorice, which embodies the principle of one sweet and one cold.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we use herbs like Shen, Qi, Ling, and Bai Zhu, which are meant to tonify the spleen as supplements, don’t we risk supplementing while concurrently aggravating external heat? When it comes to dietary supplements, we should focus on their essence rather than their flavor. For instance, the essence of the five grains nourishes the body, while the essence of the five vegetables enhances it. After each meal, one would feel refreshed, and the accumulated internal heat can gradually be expelled through the pores—how delightful! Many do not understand this principle; they rush to use rich and sweet flavors for supplementation. Although one may appear robust and vibrant in the moment, they fail to realize that the oily and greasy elements obstruct the meridians, preventing external heat from being released. Over time, this solidifies the internal constitution, with no prospect of release. The ancients recognized this and preferred to consume plain vegetables, knowing it would temporarily weaken the body, making it easier for pathogenic factors to exit—that should be regarded as valuable wisdom. In the case of edema linked to the spleen, using Ling and Bai Zhu is appropriate; for insomnia due to heart issues, one would use Suan Zao Ren and Fu Shen. Ultimately, the aim of tonifying deficiencies while clearing heat has not been well understood, hence the detailed discussion.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>
