<p><strong>Evil Spirits Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Golden Prescriptions [Tang, Sun Simiao]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Flying Corpses and Ghost Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The disease of flying corpses refers to the corpse-related ailments among the five corpses, and is also associated with various malicious spirits causing harm. Its manifestations can vary greatly, ranging from thirty-six to as many as ninety-nine types. Generally, it causes chills and fevers, leading to a state of heaviness and silence, with the afflicted often unaware of their suffering while feeling pervasive malevolence. Over the years, this can accumulate and lead to a state of stagnation, ultimately resulting in death. After one dies, it may impact others to the extent of annihilating entire families. Those who suspect they are experiencing such symptoms should seek urgent treatment.</p>
<p>For any abdominal pain, if one consumes several hot medicinals and the abdomen remains still without relief, yet the breath quickens, this indicates a corpse ailment. One should first take one liter of licorice juice, and after a short while, take an entire dose of Jumei decoction. If one manages to have a bowel movement, they should feel somewhat relieved. This is effective for severe constipation, residual food stagnation, and for women suffering from unpredictable intense menstrual pain.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Ghost Attack</h3>
<p>The illness known as &quot;Ghost Attack&quot; occurs suddenly without warning, causing the person to feel as if pierced by a knife. There is acute, unbearable pain in the chest, sides, and abdomen that cannot be pressed or alleviated. The patient may cough up blood, have blood come from the nose and mouth, or experience internal bleeding; it is also referred to as &quot;Ghost Plague.&quot;</p>
<h3>Sudden Malady</h3>
<p>&quot;Sudden Malady&quot; is akin to being afflicted by evil spirits. It is similar to &quot;Ghost Attack,&quot; and the treatments for both are derived similarly.</p>
<h3>Being Afflicted by Evil</h3>
<p>The patient experiences sudden bloating and discomfort in the heart and abdomen, with either diarrhea or vomiting not occurring, resembling dry cholera. What people commonly refer to as being &quot;afflicted by evil&quot; arises from a lack of mental integrity and excessive fear, leading to an assault by evil spirits, which may attach themselves and cause silence and confusion, resulting in nonsensical speech, slander, and open criticism of others without regard for consequences. When good or bad fortunes are spoken of before they manifest, and the time arrives without any mishap, a person with awareness understands the cause. They may ascend heights or navigate dangers as if on level ground, or they may weep and moan, wishing to avoid others, appearing drunk or mad. Their symptoms can vary widely, but treatment should be tailored according to local customs and practices.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>The Five Corpses</strong></p>
<p>The flying corpse causes hair to gradually rise without reason, coming suddenly with a sensation of sharp pain in the abdomen and chest, along with shortness of breath and feeling of fullness. The hiding corpse lurks within the flesh and blood of a person; upon contact, it activates, causing the same sensations of abdominal fullness, sharp pain, shortness of breath, and can resurge after healing. The sinking corpse, at the time of onset, also causes abdominal cramping, fullness, and shortness of breath; even after rest, it remains lodged in the person&#39;s organs, resulting in pervasive discomfort. The wind corpse circulates in the four limbs and meridians, showing a cold and erratic presence, silently moving without pain and can be activated by wind. The lurking corpse conceals within the five organs, persisting for years without showing symptoms; once it manifests, it leads to sharp abdominal pain, fullness, and shortness of breath. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are those afflicted by residual corpses, which are the corpses left behind by the five corpses, combined with external malevolent energies that invade the body, causing chills and fever, occasionally abdominal pain and fullness, or lumps that rise, or tension in the back and waist, or a heavy feeling throughout the body, with muddled spirits, making one feel perpetually unwell. Every change in the seasons can lead to severe consequences, and over many years, this gradually leads to stagnation, ultimately resulting in death. After death, the affliction may pass to others, even leading to the extermination of a household, hence it is called corpse affliction. All can be addressed with honeysuckle vine leaves, finely crushed and boiled down to a concentrated juice for daily consumption, three times a day, to heal.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Historical and Contemporary Medical System (Ming - Xu Chunfu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discourse on Evil and Pestilence</strong></p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: When evil qi is excessive, it leads to solidity; when the righteous qi is lost, it results in vacuity. The “evil” referred to in the classics includes wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and excess of fiery evils; it is not like the ghosts and spirits that the common people speak of. Diseases may manifest as a sense of heart-related vacuity, causing fear and astonishment, resembling drunkenness or stupor, as though afflicted by evil spirits; or an excess of yangming may cause one to sing on high or run away without clothes, all stemming from phlegm and fire, not the delusion of ghostly phenomena. Although there were ancient prohibitions and charms, along with the incantations derived from Nāgārjuna, these were merely techniques to transform essence and qi, which can alleviate doubts and restore the mind to its rightful state; thus, how could evil and pestilence be dispelled? </p>
<p>Danxi said: Common saying refers to the “冲恶” (chong&#39;e) which means to repel and reject evil spirits resulting in illness. Those who suffer from this have, without exception, previously experienced depletion of qi and blood. Qi and blood are the spirit of the heart. When the spirit is already weakened, evil can enter; this is a plausible occurrence. When both blood and qi are depleted, and phlegm obstructs the heart and chest, preventing movement and circulation, it leads to the malfunctioning of the twelve organs; perception, speech, and actions become deluded. If one applies evil means to treat such conditions, that person is destined for death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Sickness Arises from the Heart</strong></p>
<p>In secluded places such as valleys and mountains, there may be spirits and apparitions, fox spirits and strange creatures, as well as animals like chickens and dogs that have transformed into demons over many years. Even if they are enchanting, they merely prey upon those whose vital energy is weakened and whose righteous spirit is faint. When the righteous spirit is weak, the heart becomes disturbed; a disturbed heart leads to delusions in seeing and hearing, to nonsensical words and actions—all are nothing but evil. It is only due to evil perceptions that such things exist. The righteous person, free from illness, cannot perceive these disturbances, and this can be examined. With a single correction of the heart, all evils will naturally withdraw; what suspicion remains of malevolent spirits?<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Prohibition of Evil Spells and Medicine for Combined Treatment</strong></p>
<p>To treat malevolent diseases, even though the prohibition of spells alleviates doubts, medication must carefully consider the balance of deficiency and fullness, phlegm, fire, and their intensity. Only through the unification of internal and external treatments can the illness be resolved swiftly. If one solely relies on sorcery without medicine, the illness cannot be eradicated, and there is no rationale for recovery. Conversely, if one only uses medicine without addressing doubts through sorcery, the healing will be delayed. Hence, a combined approach of internal and external treatment yields rapid effects, which is the foundation of this practice.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Indicators</strong></p>
<p>A pulse that is occasionally sparse and then rapid, sometimes large and then small, or irregularly hurried or knotted indicates evil pulses. A tense and urgent pulse signifies escaping spirits, while a slippery pulse indicates ghost affliction.</p>
<p><strong>Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br>【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Malevolent Influence</strong></p>
<p>Manifestations of malevolent influence occur due to offending unnatural energies, suddenly causing hands and feet to feel cold, skin to develop bumps, a darkening of the face, disorientation, or nonsensical speech, along with clenched jaws and silenced mouths. Sometimes, there’s dizziness, collapse, and an inability to recognize people. This includes sudden fainting, guest disturbance, spirit flight, ghostly strikes, mourning inquiries, temple visits, or tomb climbing—all indicating such ailments. Administer Suhe Xiang pills, observe as the patient slightly revives, and then give the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder, which is named the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shishi, Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>In case of possession</strong></p>
<p>For urgent treatment, one must not delay even for a moment. Just as possession in a person is indeed due to phlegm. The prescription includes three qian of ginseng, three qian of white atractylodes, and three qian of pinellia, along with one qian of coarse dried fruit and one qian of dried orange peel, to be decocted in water for oral administration. The brilliance of this formula lies in the coarse dried fruit, which can open up the orifices and allows the combined herbs to directly enter the heart, completely dispelling the stagnation caused by phlegm. Once the phlegm is expelled, what remains of the evil?</p>
<p><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Returning the Soul Decoction</strong> (from Zhang Zhongjing, same below)<br>For sudden death caused by spirit disturbance.<br>Two liang of ephedra without nodes, originally four liang.<br>Seventy pieces of peeled apricot kernels (double kernels).<br>One liang of roasted licorice.<br>The three ingredients above should be boiled in eight sheng of water until three sheng remain, then strain and divide for drinking. It broadly treats various disturbances.  </p>
<p><strong>Another formula</strong><br>A handful of chive roots,<br>Two pieces of black plum,<br>Half sheng of dried wild ginger, stir-fried.<br>Boil the three ingredients above in ten dou of water, and have the sick person taste the decanted liquid three times; if it floats, the person is alive, if it sinks, they are dead. Boil down to three sheng, strain and divide for drinking.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Wuzi Decoction</strong> </p>
<p>This treats sudden onset of wind-evil, ghostly influences, pain in the heart and abdomen, and bloating. </p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Da Huang (Rhubarb) and Gan Cao (Licorice) each 3 liang (approx. 180g)</li>
<li>Dang Gui (Angelica) and Shao Yao (Peony) each 2 liang (approx. 120g)</li>
<li>Wu Tou (Aconite) 10 pieces</li>
<li>Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) and Mi (Honey) each 1 jin (approx. 600g)</li>
<li>Gui Xin (Cinnamon Bark) 4 liang (approx. 240g)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:<br>Crush the above eight ingredients, separately soak the Da Huang in 9 sheng (approx. 2.25 liters) of water, boil to reduce to 3 sheng. Prepare the Wu Tou separately by stew with honey until reduced to 1 sheng, mix into the decoction, strain out the residue, and take in doses of 3 he (approx. 90ml). If one walks for thirty li (approx. 15km), take another dose, three times a day. Do not exceed four he.</p>
<p><strong>Centipede Decoction</strong></p>
<p>This treats severe wind-evil, fluctuating evil qi, pain that pierces through the back, or moves under the skin, and is variable, bitter and hot, with pain in the limbs and shortness of breath. </p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Centipede</li>
<li>Niu Huang (Bovine Bile) 1 fen (approx. 3g)</li>
<li>Da Huang 2 liang (approx. 120g)</li>
<li>Dan Sha (Cinnabar) and Ren Shen (Ginseng) each 3 fen (approx. 9g)</li>
<li>Xi Xin (Asarum), Gui Jiu (Ghost Pepper), Dang Gui, Gui Xin, Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) each 1 liang (approx. 60g)</li>
<li>Huang Qin (Scutellaria) and She Xiang (Musk) each half liang (approx. 15g)</li>
<li>Fu Zi (Aconite) 4 pieces</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:<br>Crush these thirteen ingredients, use 1 dou (approx. 10 liters) of water, boil to extract 3 sheng, strain out the residue, add the powdered Niu Huang and She Xiang, dividing it into three doses. </p>
<p><strong>Additional Recipe</strong><br>This treats sudden onset of wind-evil, cold invading the abdomen, painful cramps in bowel movements, or ghostly issues, manifesting without warning, resulting in searing pain in the chest and abdomen as if stabbed by a knife, accompanied by inability to speak.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Licorice, dried ginger, poria, dried rehmannia, sheep fat, angelica, and asarum each one tael; peony, wuzhuyu, and cinnamon heart each two taels; fifteen fresh gardenia seeds. The above eleven ingredients should be crushed and boiled in eight sheng of water until three sheng is obtained. Strain out the dregs, melt the fat completely, and divide into three doses. If purgation is desired, add three taels of rhubarb.</p>
<p>Another prescription for treating sudden onset of wind stroke, with the bowstring reflexively pulled back, or cases of flying corpses or escaping spirits, accompanied by cramping pain in the heart and abdomen: one tael each of dried rehmannia, poria, cyperi, angelica, and licorice; two taels each of wuzhuyu, cinnamon heart, dried ginger, and peony; fourteen fresh gardenia seeds. The above ten ingredients should be crushed and boiled in eight sheng of water until three sheng is obtained, divided into three doses. For severe cases, add two taels of sheep fat, and one tael each of angelica, ginseng, and peony. If the abdomen is hard and tight, add three taels of rhubarb.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Peach Skin Soup</strong>: Treats adverse qi in the middle, abdominal pain, fullness in the chest and flanks, and shortness of breath. Use one handful of peach white skin, one tael each of pearl and aconite, five jiao each of evodia and fermented soybean, fourteen pieces of gardenia fruit, three taels of angelica, and two taels of cinnamon heart. The eight ingredients (for the mouth) are to be chewed, boiled with five sheng of water, reduced to two sheng, strained, and then mixed with pearl powder, divided into two doses. If angelica, evodia, fermented soybean, and cinnamon heart are not available, a simpler formula can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Peach Slave Soup</strong>: Treats adverse reactions, various corpse and pestilential diseases, and sudden abdominal cramping pain. Use two taels each of peach slave, angelica, ginseng, and dried ginger, three taels each of liquorice and rhizome, one tael each of vermilion, musk, poria, rhinoceros horn, ghost-arrow feathers, and cinnamon heart. The twelve ingredients (for the mouth) are to be chewed, boiled with nine sheng of water, reduced to two and a half sheng, strained, and divided into two doses, to be taken before meals. For constipation with abdominal fullness, add three taels of rhubarb and two taels of Glauber&#39;s salt. If available, add one tael of realgar, but omit sand and rhizome.</p>
<p><strong>Small Attached Aconite Soup</strong>: Treats flying corpses and wind, sudden sharp pains not localized, where needling moves the pain, taking a day and a half to heal, with relapses in moments. Use one fen each of asarum, liquorice (can use wild liquorice), and tianxiong, three fen of cinnamon heart, one tael each of aconite, black cohosh, and dried ginger, half a tael each of realgar and pearl. The nine ingredients are to be treated through a fine sieve, taken with wine using a short spoon. Do not increase the amount too much, use as per the dosage. If available, four fen of Sichuan pepper can be used, but omit cinnamon heart and aconite.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Great Attached Decoction</strong> treats the five corpses and the obstructed evils, similar to the previous condition. Ingredients: Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis) - 1 tael; Youba (Dodder) - 1 tael; Jiao Mu (Peppercorn) - 1 tael; Xixin (Asarum) - 1 tael; Xiong Huang (Realgar) - 1 tael; Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) - 1 tael; Huang Lian (Coptis) - 1 tael; Zhen Zhu (Pearl) - 3 fen; Jin Ya (Golden Tooth) - 1 fen; Xi Jiao (Rhinoceros Horn) - 1 fen; She Xiang (Musk) - 1 fen; Niu Huang (Cattle Gall) - 1 fen; Tian Xiong (Asiatic Black Bear) - 0.5 tael; Gui Xin (Cinnamon Heart) - 0.5 tael; Wu Gong (Centipede) - 1 piece.

[Eating sickness refers to illnesses caused by consuming food.] Another treatment: take similar small amounts of the original food and wrap them in cloth, then burn them until the size of an apricot, consume with water.</p>
<p>To treat escaping corpses, spirit sickness, as well as pains in the heart, abdomen, and body, do not draw near: take mugwort, crush it into small pieces, apply to the painful area, thicker than an inch. Mix hot soup with ash to make it very hot, place it on the mugwort, and change it when it cools. This should cure in two to three applications.</p>
<p>To treat escaping corpses, flying corpses, and also for toxic swellings from violent winds flowing into limbs, head, and face: take one liter of white mustard seeds, steam them hot and pound, mix with two taels of yellow lead, divide into two parts, put them in a loose cloth bag and steam again, applying the hot bags to the pain, changing to keep them hot. Do this three to five times for definitive relief.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Pain in the skin is called &quot;zheng zha,&quot; and it can be treated with a mixture of vinegar and the earth from a nest of swallows.</p>

<p>For thirty years of &quot;qi zha&quot;: Take half a pound of fermented bean heart and one unit of fresh pepper, add two liters of water, and boil until reduced to half a liter. Apply it when warm or cool, ask the patient to lie on their side, and use a bamboo tube to inject the juice through a large hole, as harmful substances should be expelled after some time. This method has cured many near-fatal cases.</p>
<p>Regarding acupuncture:</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that when a person is worried or overly thoughtful, it harms the heart and can cause loss of vital essence due to shock, leading to sweating from the heart. If one encounters the influence of the lesser yin above, and the heavens do not provide sufficient support, it results in three deficiencies and a loss of spirit. The heart is the official of the sovereign, from which the spirit emanates. When the spirit is lost and cannot gather, it can lead to a fire that does not arrive in time, resulting in encounters with malevolent spirits that cause sudden death. The treatment involves needling the pathway of the hand&#39;s lesser yang, specifically at the Yang Pool point, and also needling the Heart Shu point for recovery.</p>
<p>In general, excessive eating, fatigue, or overindulgence harms the spleen; drinking to fullness can lead to sweating from the stomach, and drunken debauchery can cause sweating from the spleen. If one encounters the influence of the greater yin above, and the heavens do not provide adequate support, this results in the same three deficiencies and a loss of spirit. The spleen serves as the advisor, from which intention emerges. When the spirit is lost and cannot gather, it can lead to an encounter with earth that does not arrive in time, resulting in encounters with malevolent spirits that cause sudden death. Treatment can involve needling the pathway of the foot&#39;s greater yang, specifically at the Chong Yang point, and also needling the Spleen Shu point for recovery.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Prolonged sitting in damp areas and suddenly immersing oneself in water can harm the kidneys. If one then undertakes a long journey and sweats excessively, or encounters the sun when the celestial timing is unfavorable, one may suffer from the three voids, leading to the loss of vitality in the kidneys. The kidneys are essential for strength and vitality. When vitality is lost, the spirit cannot concentrate, and if one encounters insufficient water during drought years, malevolent spirits may cause sudden death. One can puncture the area where the solar energy passes, known as the Jinggu point, and also puncture the Shenshu point related to the kidneys for recovery.</p>
<p>Anger and resentment can damage the liver. If one then runs quickly in fear and sweats profusely, or encounters the Yin phase of the celestial timing, and the conditions are unfavorable, one again suffers from the three voids leading to lost vitality in the liver. The liver governs planning and strategy. When vitality is lost, the spirit cannot concentrate, and if one encounters insufficient wood during drought years, malevolent spirits may also cause sudden death. One can puncture the area where the Shaoyang energy passes, called the Qiuxu point, and also puncture the Gan Shu point related to the liver for recovery.</p>
<p>Chilling from cold drinks can harm the lungs. If one engages in strenuous activity afterwards and experiences breathlessness from the lungs, or encounters the Yangming phase of celestial timing when conditions are unfavorable, one suffers from the three voids leading to loss of vitality in the lungs.

<p>In cases of liver deficiency, encountering a white corpse ghost leads to sudden convulsions with loss of awareness. This condition, known as &quot;corpse death,&quot; presents with unchanging spirit in the eyes, cold limbs, yet warmth in the heart and abdomen, without saliva in the mouth, and the tongue not retracting. It can be revived through puncture.</p>
<p>In cases of heart deficiency, encountering a black corpse ghost leads to sudden convulsions with loss of awareness. The limbs are cold, yet the spirit in the eyes remains unchanged, the breath is constrained, and the tongue does not retract; revival is possible if punctured in time.</p>

The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: Tianfu relates to sudden illness caused by evil winds and energies, flying corpses, malevolent diseases, ghostly speech, and vanishing corpses. Fenglong corresponds to reversal of qi, sudden blue pain in the feet like a stab, abdominal pain as if cut by a knife, difficult bowel movements, anxiety, and seeing ghosts appear comically, with sudden pains in the face and limbs. The side court is located between the armpit and the ribs, aligning with the nipple, where the area two inches behind the nipple is depressed, commonly known as Zhushi. One should puncture five fen and apply moxibustion fifty times. This point addresses sudden illness, flying corpses, vanishing diseases, and fullness in the chest. Jiujun Zhongfu is located two inches below the Zhushi, punctured five fen and treated with moxibustion thirty times. This point addresses evil winds, malevolent energies, and vanishing corpses, with internal stagnation of blood. Baihui and Yuzhen deal with sudden illnesses that cause one to become stiff and collapse, accompanied by sensitivity to cold and wind. Tongtian and Luoxi pertain to temporary stiffness and collapse.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The Great Weaver governs stiffness and inability to stand for long, causing discomfort and restlessness. For middle ailments, apply moxibustion on the stomach and diaphragm with fifty cones, and recovery will follow.</p>

Additional moxibustion of three cones one inch below the heart.</p>
<p>For the elbow&#39;s pattern, do moxibustion according to the years of age. For all diseases related to food stagnation, moxibustion should be performed on the small finger of the hand, adjusted by age, with the left for men and the right for women. For the five poisons causing inability to eat or drink, use ten cones at the region three inches below the heart and diaphragm. </p>
<p>For water stagnation (excess saliva in the mouth): as the classics say, the lungs invade the kidneys, causing post-meal vomiting of water; perform moxibustion on the lung back point. Also, do moxibustion at the Three Yin Intersection.</p>
<p>Moreover, apply moxibustion on the period gate point, located between the second ribs under the breasts, to drain the lungs and nourish the kidneys, adjusting by age. For all stagnation, whether new or longstanding, first lie on your back and moxibustion three inches below both breasts in line with the third rib, with up to three hundred cones depending on the age. </p>
<p>For various qi disturbances, this is also called stagnant market. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Guidelines&quot; states: using the ghost moxibustion method from Qin Chengzu, treat all instances of fright, mania, and delusions, such as when one climbs over walls or roofs and shouts without regard for relatives. Bind the thumbs of the patient with fine hemp rope, placing a large moxa cone within, igniting the corners of the thumb and the sides. If one area does not catch fire, it will be ineffective; this should be done seven times for remarkable results.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Medical Case</p>
<p>&quot;The Heart Method of Danxi&quot; states: Diseases of deficiency and phlegm resemble sinister influences. The blood and qi are the spirit of the body; when the spirit becomes weak, evils can enter, which may logically occur. If both blood and qi are depleted and phlegm obstructs the middle burner, it hinders the ascending and descending processes, causing the twelve officials to lose their functions. Perception and actions become delusional, and treating it with evils will surely lead to death. </p>
<p>A young man, during the hot month, became extremely thirsty after excessive labor and indulged in plum juice. Furthermore, he experienced intense fright three or four times, speaking and seeing irrationally, with symptoms resembling evil spirits. The pulse on both hands was weak, thin, and rapid. I said: The rapid pulse indicates deficiency heat, while the thin pulse indicates fright. Additionally, the sour plum juice had stifled the middle jiao. Therefore, to nourish deficiency, clear heat, and guide out the phlegm stagnation, the illness could be stabilized. </p>
<p>I prescribed ginseng, atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, scutellaria, and lima bean, boiling them into a strong decoction, and added bamboo juice and ginger juice. After ten days, there was no effect, and everyone thought the prescription was unsuitable. I palpated the pulse and realized the deficiency remained unaddressed and phlegm had not been resolved, so I instructed to add ginger juice (jingli) to the previous formula. After taking it for another ten days, he then stabilized.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>After one man got drunk and full, he imagined he saw a spirit.

After drinking a bowl or two of salt water, he vomited one or two liters of phlegm, sweated profusely, and slept peacefully through the night.</p>
<p>The &quot;Precious Mirror of Health&quot; states: The envoy from Xiangzhou requested that I examine his pulse. Upon diagnosis, the pulse was sometimes strong, sometimes weak, sometimes short, sometimes long; this indicated an imbalance of blood and qi, with evil qi harming the vital energy. The official mentioned that while staying overnight at the Han-Dan inn, he dreamt of a woman in blue clothing, her face unseen, who struck him under the arm. He felt a sharp pain that persisted, accompanied by cold and heat, preventing him from eating, which he believed to be an attack by a ghost. I suggested he could take the Eight Poison Red Pill. I had previously read in the &quot;Record of Famous Physicians&quot; that Li Ziyu’s Eight Poison Red Pill was effective against ghost attacks, so I gave him three pills. He took them before sleeping, and by the next morning, he expelled two buckets of clear water as a result.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Recently in Huizhou, I attempted to prepare a medicinal pill known as Shenjing Dan.

The one in front asked, “Have you arrived?” The one behind replied, “I have arrived.” Upon striking down, there was a sudden explosive sound, and she was then plagued by a nightmare, waking to a sharp pain in her heart that was unbearable, feeling muddled for a time. I suddenly recalled that the Shenjing Dan was related to this incident, so I took three pills and made her take them, and shortly thereafter, she was free of illness. She remarked that after taking the medicine, the pain ceased, and she regained her senses, feeling as she normally would. In later encounters, if there was any evil spirit present, giving her one or two doses would always yield results. It is mentioned in &quot;Qianjin&quot; that the essential medicine for treating strokes is rare in recent times, with Qing and magnetic stones being difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Family Essential Readings&quot; says: When Zhang Zhongyu&#39;s daughter was in the pavilion, she was dazed and unaware of her surroundings. After being revived with Suhexiang Pills, she spoke wildly and could not stop rambling. I examined her left pulse, which was large and without order; her right pulse had three beats, faint and difficult to detect. This was indeed like having two different people for her hands, as this evil relied upon the pulse. I tied the two large toes together, and used moxa to apply heat to both for seven sessions; the evil spirit then wept and sought to leave. I prescribed a formula to regulate Qi and calm the stomach, adding Taonu, and within a few days, the affliction was eliminated.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Door of Sudden Death</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Internal Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Six Origins and Proper Governance</strong></p>
<p>The governance of Yangming in the heavens, under the influence of the dual energies, causes severe calamity, leading to the people dying suddenly. [Note: The dual energies refer to the two types of fire in the roles of ruler and minister, so during severe calamity, there is a tendency for sudden death.] The governance of Shaoyang in the heavens, influenced by the three energies, also leads to the people dying suddenly. [Note: The heavenly influence of time belongs to Shaoyang; when the two fires intersect, with both wind and heat arriving, sudden death is common.] When the heat is pent up, and the people fall ill severely, they become confused and distressed, leading to sudden death. [Note: Confusion and distress are illnesses of the lungs. Excessive heat harms the essence, contributing to sudden death.] When Shaoyang descends, it brings sudden conditions, spasms, and sudden death. [Note: This is a common issue in winter ailments.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Constant Principles</strong></p>
<p>Shaoyang governs the heavens, with wind spreading across the land, and its influence is sudden and swift. [Note: The influence of wind is rapid.] Jueyin governs the heavens, the fire is unleashed violently, and its manifestation is swift.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: In the realm of the厥阴 wind-wood controlling the heavens, the少阳 fire resides in the springs; wood and fire nurture each other, hence fire acts with violence. The少阳 governs the pivot, thus the mechanisms are swift.</p>
<p><strong>Great Theory of Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse is like panting, it is called violent厥. Violent厥 refers to the state of being unable to speak to others. <strong>Note</strong>: Like panting, the pulse is slippery and rapid; this indicates obstruction of phlegm and water.</p>
<p><strong>Essential Subtle Pulse Theory</strong></p>
<p>A pulse that is floating and scattered signifies dizziness and fainting. <strong>Note</strong>: This indicates the yin is counteracting the yang.</p>
<p><strong>Theory of True Organs of the Jade Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>When a sudden emptiness arises within the body, and the five organs are completely closed, the pulse pathways are blocked, and the qi cannot circulate, it is akin to falling into a pit; there can be no timeframe for this. <strong>Note</strong>: When wind and cold evils invade the body, the essence and qi are abruptly depleted, hence the sudden emptiness leads to the closure of the five organs&#39; qi, blocking the pulse pathways, so that qi cannot circulate, much like the urgency of falling into a pit; it is difficult to anticipate the time of occurrence. </p>
<p>If the pulse completely ceases to come, it resembles a person&#39;s one breath: The &quot;Essential Questions&quot; of the True Organs of the Jade Mechanism suggests: &quot;According to a person&#39;s one breath, the pulse arrives five or six times; why would this be deemed death? The character &#39;breath&#39; must be a mistake. It should be &#39;exhale.&#39;&quot; Five or six pulses may not show in the physical body, but even if the true organs are not visible, death can still occur. <strong>Note</strong>: In emergencies, when the pulse does not come, it signifies that the life force has been extinguished internally. Five or six pulses indicate that the evil qi is strong externally; even if the true organs are not visible, death may still happen.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What is the reason for those who suddenly die or fall ill? The Master of the Few replied: The three deficiencies cause sudden death and illness. When one possesses the three fullnesses, malevolent forces cannot harm a person. Being in a year of decline, encountering a month of emptiness, and missing the harmony of the season, one is harmed by the harmful winds; this is called the three deficiencies. In a year of abundance, meeting a full moon, and obtaining harmony with the season, even if faced with harmful winds or malevolent energies, one cannot be endangered. </p>
<p>[Note: To be in a year of decline implies that the six energies administered by heaven are insufficient. To encounter a month of emptiness happens at the time when the lunar territories are empty. Missing the harmony of the season means the energies of the four seasons are not aligned correctly. The protective energy interacts with heaven and earth, corresponds with the sun and moon; thus, a year of deficiency, a month of emptiness, and a discordant season all indicate the abnormality of protective energy. When this protective energy is deficient, the channels become loose, allowing malevolent energies to penetrate within, resulting in sudden illness and death.]<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Five Colors Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Thunder God said: How can we know a person has not been ill yet dies suddenly? The Yellow Emperor replied: When the great energy enters the internal organs, the person dies suddenly without having been ill. The Thunder God asked: How can we know a person appears to have recovered from a minor illness yet dies suddenly? The Yellow Emperor said: If red appears on both cheeks, as large as a thumb, although the illness seems minor, that person will surely die. If black appears on the courtyard, as large as a thumb, that person will die suddenly without being ill.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The great energy entering the organs is the external evil that enters the internal organs, hence death occurs without prior illness. The term &quot;not ill&quot; refers to the absence of external signs. When a person recovers from a minor illness yet dies, it indicates an internal disease where the organs interact. The five colors appearing on the face reflect the energies of the five organs. The accumulation of color externally visible indicates the true essence of the organs leaking out.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Jinkui Yaolüe</strong> (The Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Coffer) by Zhang Ji from the Han Dynasty</p>

<p><strong>Yixue Gangmu</strong> (Medical Codes) by Lou Ying from the Ming Dynasty</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Stroke and Collapse</strong></p>
<p>A sudden stroke refers to a condition where one suddenly loses consciousness, resembling a dead body, yet the breath does not cease, and the pulse remains active. Sometimes the pulse is chaotic, sometimes strong then weak, or fine but persistent, while the chest remains warm. In cases of heat stroke causing fainting, one must quickly support the person in a cool place, and avoid ice water. Instead, use a cloth dipped in warm soup to warm the abdomen and the area just below the navel. Continue with the warm soup to cover the abdomen until warmth is restored, which will gradually help the person regain consciousness. If hot soup is not available, it is preferable to scoop warm soil from the ground to apply on the abdomen, replacing it when it cools. The ancient method, without soup, involves scooping hot soil onto the navel and creating a hollow space for the person to urinate into, as a substitute for soup, and continue with bamboo leaf Baihu Decoction.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>If one experiences heatstroke, quickly chew a large piece of raw ginger and wash it down with cold water. If one feels disoriented and suffocated, chew a large clove of garlic and wash it down with cold water. If unable to chew, one can use water to grind it and drink it to regain consciousness. If in a hurry on the road and feeling extremely thirsty with no water available, quickly chew about two inches of green onion; the juice can compensate for two liters of water.</p>
<p>In general, a person may suddenly become as if dead, with no movement, unaware of their surroundings, eyes shut and unable to open, speechless, or only faintly aware of others, discomforted by sounds, and feeling dizzy; after some time, they may regain consciousness. This occurs due to excessive sweating, a deficiency of blood, and Qi stagnating in the blood, leading to Yang rising without descending and Qi being blocked. Hence, the body feels lifeless. Once Qi flows again and blood returns to normal, Yin and Yang are restored, and consciousness returns after a while. This condition is known as &quot;stagnant heat&quot; or &quot;blood stasis,&quot; and is common among women. Remedies include Bawei Decoction and Cangong Powder.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Sudden Death</strong>  </p>
<p>Bian Que and the &quot;Shoulder-Back Prescription&quot; mention that being struck by evil and sudden death are similar in nature, and treatments for both should be referred to and utilized. When one has died, pound fresh calamus roots, squeeze the juice, and administer it; recovery will be immediate. </p>
<p>For sudden stroke, cadaveric rigidity, distress due to obstruction, stroke, heatstroke, and similar conditions, all should be treated to induce evacuation. Zhongjing states: to resolve distress due to obstruction, one must induce profuse sweating; hence, the Return the Soul Decoction uses ephedra and cinnamon twig, while the Clear the Soul Decoction employs schizopepon, and various treatments for sudden strokes utilize soapberry and pinellia (for nasal inhalation), as well as cuminum and arsenic rubbed on the gums to expel phlegm. These methods aim to open the upper energizer, allowing the pathogenic factors on the surface to circulate. </p>
<p>For heatstroke, one should avoid cool water, as it may close the pore openings, which is aligned with this principle. In mountainous areas, for those stricken suddenly by evil, apply moxa to the navel where a hundred vital points converge; blow soapberry powder into the nostrils; or administer chives juice into the ears.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>&quot;The Ben Shi Fang states: It is said in the world that conditions related to Qi, although not found in medical texts, can occur due to sudden joy harming Yang, sudden anger harming Yin, and prolonged sadness or disappointment causing Qi to be excessive and counterflowing. Many ailments arise from these cases, leading to symptoms like excessive salivation, tightness of the jaw, and conditions resembling stroke. This can lead to fatal outcomes. In the year of the Yang wood in the Yuan You period, my mother suffered from such a misfortune, a lingering sorrow to this day. She had a vegetarian diet and was weak in Qi and blood, having grieved over the loss of her son. One day, she experienced Qi counterflow, tightness of the jaw and excessive salivation. A local doctor diagnosed it as a stroke, gave her a strong purge, and she died that evening. I have held this grief ever since. Whenever I encounter such symptoms, I quickly administer Su He Wan and she recovers, after which I adjust treatment according to the heat or cold without fail. </p>
<p>Qi disorders arise when Qi does not return to its source, resulting in conditions resembling stroke, leading to faintness and tight jaw, but without phlegm, so one must not mistakenly use wind-dispelling medications or laxatives. First, use ginger juice with warm decoction to adjust Su He Xiang Wan; next, apply Qi-clearing decoction or Da Liu Qi Yin, adding Shi Chang Pu to smooth the Qi for recovery; thereafter, use Zhong Ding Tang with Mu Xiang to harmonize the center and restore Qi to its path. If this does not adjust properly, it leads to Qi counterflow and the emergence of altered symptoms.&quot;<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Sudden Stroke and Convulsion</strong>  </p>
<p>The classics state: Sudden illness and death are all attributed to fire. Commentary notes: This is because the nature of fire is swift and fierce. Therefore, the initial treatment should use medications that are neither cold nor hot, neither descending nor ascending; in severe cases, they can indeed treat. Common distinctions include wind stroke, Qi disturbance, food stagnation, cold, heat, dampness, and adverse effects. However, if one suddenly collapses, is unconscious, has phlegm obstructing the throat making sounds, or exhibits crooked mouth and eyes, paralysis of limbs, hemiplegia, or the six pulses being sunken, or if there is swelling beneath the fingers, then sesame oil, ginger juice, and bamboo sap can be mixed with Suhexiang pills. If the mouth is closed, pry it open to administer, or use San Sheng drink one or two ounces, plus one ounce of ginseng, decocted and mixed with two or three cups of bamboo sap and a little ginger juice.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>If the obstruction cannot be relieved, do not administer the medication. Immediately take raw Pinellia and grind it into a powder, then blow it into the nostrils. Alternatively, use fine herbs like Asarum, Soapberry, or Acorus, grinding them into powder to blow into the nose until sneezing occurs, which can lead to recovery. This method can help assess the severity of the illness, thus determining if it is treatable. If the mouth is open and the hands are relaxed with involuntary urination, it indicates extreme deficiency and loss of Yang, requiring the immediate use of large quantities of ginseng and astragalus for nourishment, along with moxibustion on the lower abdomen.</p>
<p>For copious phlegm and drool, it is advisable to induce vomiting. An urgent remedy is the diluted salve: take four pieces of Soapberry that are plump and unblemished and remove the black skin; one tael of bright alum, finely powdered and mixed. Use five fen for light cases and three characters for heavier ones, dissolved in warm water and ingested. There is also the Bixia powder: select high-quality stone green, grind and sift, and further grind with water to fly away impurities. Take two to three qian of this, mix with three to four beans of borneol, and combine with fresh mint juice and warm wine for ingestion. Neither of these medicines should induce strong vomiting, but rather gently promote the flow of saliva from the corners of the mouth, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it is said that if the mouth is wide open and unable to close, the hands are relaxed and without coordination, the eyes are closed indicating liver dysfunction, involuntary urination indicating kidney dysfunction, and the voice resembles snoring indicating lung dysfunction, these are all signs of being untreatable. However, if not all five signs are present, taking ginseng and astragalus paste promptly, along with moxibustion on the lower abdomen, may still lead to survival.</p>
<p>If a patient exhibits symptoms of stiff posture, vomiting clear froth, shaking their head uncontrollably, flushed face, beads of sweat like pearls, or if the face is red-black, with closed eyes and an open mouth, panting and involuntary urination, these cases are untreatable. Among various patients, whether unconscious or conscious, whether the illness is recent or prolonged, those who vomit purple-red substances are likely fatal.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The &quot;Transmission of the Heart Formula&quot; states: To treat a man or woman who suddenly faints with a flow of saliva, one must immediately assist them into a warm room, help them to sit upright, and place a good vinegar and charcoal incense in front of them, allowing the vinegar&#39;s aroma to rush into their mouth and nose. After a while, the saliva that gathers in the heart will naturally return; those lightly affected will immediately regain consciousness, while those heavily affected will also awaken. However, one must not let even a drop of soup or water enter their throat. If they do consume soup or water, the saliva will remain in the heart&#39;s channels and cannot be expelled, inevitably leading to a state of debilitation.</p>
<p>In the case of a person afflicted by wind, the six pulses are often deeply suppressed, though there may be pulses that surge beneath the fingers in a vigorous manner. A floating and slow pulse is auspicious, a firm and large or urgent pulse is ominous. A floating and slow pulse indicates cold, a weak and large pulse indicates summer heat; if it&#39;s not summer heat, it indicates deficiency. A floating and muddy pulse indicates dampness, a floating and large pulse indicates wind, while a floating and rapid pulse without heat also indicates wind. </p>
<p>Furthermore, a thin and rapid, floating and tight, or sinking and slow pulse all reflect the condition of the Qi. Wind corresponds to the external response of the person, while Qi corresponds to the external Qi. A large and surging pulse indicates heat, and a slippery pulse indicates phlegm. Whether it is floating and slippery, sinking and slippery, or thin and deficient, these all indicate deficiency combined with phlegm. One must further observe the seasonal and monthly changes as well as the individual&#39;s daily habits, correlating these with clear signs to ascertain the primary condition for treatment.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Secret Methods of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sudden Death</strong></p>
<p>Treating death is like a person&#39;s sudden demise, unresponsive to worldly matters, unable to speak due to a stroke, or perhaps afflicted by the spirits, or confronted by mountain demons, collapsing at once, unresponsive to the world. Such ailments are caused by邪气 within, with phlegm clouding the heart&#39;s pathways. Strange illnesses often stem from phlegm; there is no need for panic. Treat the phlegm, and the illness will resolve itself. However, where邪 gathers, the vital energy must be weak; using phlegm-dissolving medicine and combining it with restorative ingredients will clear the illness as if swept away, and the deceased can be revived.</p>
<p>The formula uses five qian of white atractylodes, three qian each of ginseng, poria, pinellia, and tian nanxing, one qian of white mustard seed, five fen of fresh aconite, and a large piece of fresh ginger squeezed for juice, mixed with half water and half wine, totaling two bowls, boiled down to eight parts, then taken. Externally, use soapberry thorns ground into powder. When grinding the soapberry thorns, first take a piece of paper, completely wet it, and seal it over the nostrils of the person nearby; then grind it into a fine powder. Take a spoonful with an goose feather tube and blow it into the patient’s nostrils, which will surely induce sneezing. With the prior medicine administered, they will awaken and must expel phlegm, amounting to half a basin or a whole basin, resembling glue or broth, in colors of yellow, black, blue, or red. The person will naturally feel drowsy and should not be startled; let them sleep peacefully. Upon waking, administer one qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and white peony, five qian of white atractylodes, three qian each of poria and white mustard seed, five fen each of dried tangerine peel and licorice, boiled and taken as one dose for complete recovery. This is one method of treating sudden death.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>When a person is afflicted by evil influences, it is necessarily due to a deficiency of vital energy, allowing the evil to invade through the void. Therefore, ginseng is used to strengthen the righteous energy, while pinellia and white mustard seed are utilized to dispel evil and phlegm. Tian Nanxing is particularly effective at dispelling the heart&#39;s disturbances and expelling evil; with the potent action of aconite, it forcefully penetrates to drive the evil away, causing it to retreat immediately as it escapes upward from the mouth. However, once the evil has exited, it is essential to purely replenish the stomach’s energy; thus, phlegm-dispelling agents are not used, and instead, strengthening the spleen and nourishing the stomach is prioritized. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are treatments for fatal conditions, such as for the syndrome of corpse-like stagnation, which is also due to qi deficiency. For this, one should use one tael of ginseng, five qian each of atractylodes, pinellia, and poria, along with one qian of calamus and five fen of dried tangerine peel for treatment. Although the underlying issue is an evil influence, the former condition involves yang evil, while this pertains to encountering yin evil. Yang evil occurs during the day, whereas yin evil occurs at night. In the later formula, while ginseng is also used for supplementation, there is no use of Tian Nanxing or similar herbs, targeting directly the heart&#39;s interior.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>If one cannot speak, one can also use powdered soapberry and blow it. If the first two symptoms are accompanied by involuntary urination and excessive voiding, then it is often impossible to cure; otherwise, all can be treated with a single dose for revival. The above two symptoms are methods for treating death. By drawing parallels and understanding strategies, everything falls into place. Generally, the methods for eliminating pathogens are sufficient in two categories. Next, one should consider the severity of the illness and the amount of medicine used to determine the right approach.</p>
<p>If a person suddenly sees a ghost and collapses, whether in a shrine or beside a coffin, and accidentally encounters the chilly energy of a corpse, being afflicted by the ghostly influence and becoming unresponsive, one should use the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting. They will surely expel phlegm like a gushing spring, pouring out abundantly, and if the ghost runs away, that is sufficient. If after vomiting they still see the ghost, it indicates that the phlegm has not been completely expelled. Thus, use the gourd stem powder again until the ghost is no longer seen. </p>
<p>After that, take one tael of white atractylodes, five qian of poria, one qian each of white peony, shenchu, and powdered ginger, and five fen of dried tangerine peel, and decoct them in water to drink. This method can treat impoverished individuals.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p><strong>Red Rhinoceros Horn Powder</strong>: Treats sudden illness from atmospheric evil spirits, or from nighttime toilet trips, venturing into the wild, or visiting empty rooms, or places where humans do not usually go—suddenly encountering ghostly apparitions, inhaling evil air, and collapsing suddenly, with limbs cold, fists clenched, and clear blood coming from mouth and nose, life dwindling, and immediate rescue is essential. This condition resembles corpse rigidity, but the abdomen is not gurgling, and the heart and sides are warm. Do not move the person; rather, have someone surround them and burn musk or similar substances like benzoin, frankincense, and wormwood until they regain consciousness, after which they may be moved.</p>

Take pills the size of a little gourd, using water from a well, warm or cool as desired, dissolve four pills, elderly and children should take one pill, diluted in warm wine; it is also fine to take on an empty stomach. Wrap one pill, the size of a marble, in wax paper, place in a red silk bag, and keep close to the heart; all evil spirits will dare not approach.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Three-Item Urgent Pill [Zhongjing]</strong></p>
<p>Rhubarb, dried ginger, and the outer skin, tips, and heart of the cowherb seed—each one tael—must be finely prepared and fresh. First, crush the rhubarb and dried ginger into a powder, then grind the cowherb seed into the center; combine and pound together. Mix with honey to form pills, and store them in a container. </p>
<p>This remedy addresses various acute diseases affecting the heart and abdomen. If one suffers from the toxins of an evil presence, with abdominal distension and sudden pain like being stabbed by a needle, with difficulty breathing and unresponsive mouth, if a person suddenly collapses and dies, administer three to four pills with hot bitter wine. If they cannot swallow, lift their head and pour it in until they swallow, and shortly thereafter, they will recover. If they haven’t healed, give them three additional pills, and when the stomach gurgles, they will vomit and recover. If the mouth is unresponsive, you must break their teeth to administer it.</p>
<p><strong>Another Prescription</strong>: For anyone suffering from heat toxins wishing to die, taking this will immediately revive them. </p>
<p>One and a half liters of prepared half summer, boiled down and dried (four taels), cinnamon (peeled), red poria (each half tael), licorice (one tael), and white poria (one tael)—grind all into a powder. Use fresh ginger juice to make a paste and form pills the size of tung seeds. Each time, take fifty pills with hot water. I often carry this medicine in my box during summer travel to guard against various emergencies. Both I and my servants take it daily without suffering from heat-related illnesses, and it has proven remarkable repeatedly.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Fuzi Lijun Decoction</strong> treats cold in the five internal organs, stiffness of the limbs, inability to speak, and loss of voice.

<p><strong>Separate Prescription</strong></p>
<p>For those who have suffered from sunstroke and can’t be cooled down, cooling will lead to death. Use dried grass to tie around the navel of the sunstroke victim, and have two or three people urinate over it to warm it up. Hot mud mixed with the dried grass can also be applied; alternatively, place a warm bowl or press onto a vehicle&#39;s water tank to warm the sunstroke victim. You must ensure they urinate, as this is essential. If there is no decoction, the process must still be carried out to ensure warmth. Avoid allowing the urine or vehicle&#39;s tank to cool down, as that may cause harm. If the sunstroke occurred during the summer, hot mud and warm vehicle tanks can also be utilized.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>To save a soldier from death: pound garlic to extract its juice and pour it into the nose.</p>

If there is no moisture, take juice from something boiled until dry.</p>
<p>If the corpse’s limbs are stiff and the pulse is moving but there is no breath, the qi is blocked and not flowing, hence the death occurs quietly. Blow grass and sediment into the nostrils, and place cinnamon powder under the tongue. </p>
<p>Another method: Take a strand of hair from the left side, burn it to ash, mix it with alcohol, and administer it down the throat to help them stand up.</p>
<p>For treating heatstroke: Take hot dirt from the road and apply it to the heart area. If slightly cool, it can be easily removed and the qi will flow again. </p>

Draw 200 breaths from a cow onto the patient&#39;s nose, the cow will surely lick and heal. If the cow does not cooperate, apply salt juice on the face, and the cow will then be willing to lick.<br>Another recipe: Squeeze juice from cow or horse dung and have the patient drink it. If it is not fresh, mixing with water from the dried matter is also acceptable. The &quot;Zhou Hou Fang&quot; states: For dried matter, dissolve it in human urine.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>When suffering from heatstroke and feeling dizzy: use fresh water to drop on the two breasts and fan them; for severe cases, administer an infusion of earth paste to revive. If given water to drink, it will be fatal.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Ling Shu Jing&quot;: The sun is rooted in the utmost yin and is linked at the life gate. The life gate is the eye. The sun represents opening; when it is blocked, the flesh and joints become unraveled and sudden disease arises. Therefore, for sudden diseases, it is important to target the sun and observe excess or deficiency. The skin and flesh appear weak and fragile. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: If an evil guest invades the channels of the hands and feet of the lesser yin, greater yin, and the foot yangming, all five channels converge in the ear, with the upper channel in the left angle. If all five channels are exhausted, it causes the body’s pulses to move erratically and the body loses awareness, resembling a corpse; sometimes referred to as a stiff corpse. One should puncture the inner side of the big toe nail and the tip resembling a chive leaf. Then, puncture the sole of the foot, followed by the middle finger nail on each side. Next, puncture the inner side of the hand&#39;s big toe and the palm&#39;s heart at the tip of the lesser yin sharp bone, each punctured once, and it will be effective immediately. If it does not stop, blow into both ears with a bamboo tube, cut one inch of hair from the left angle, burn it, and drink a cup of good wine. If unable to drink, administer it immediately.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot;: In a case of corpse-like rigidity where the person does not recognize others, the pulse continues as usual; the hidden white and great dun points are to be targeted. In a dazed state of corpse-like rigidity with a headache, the midpoint and the foot-shen point are to be targeted. For sudden death resembling a corpse, the golden gate should be targeted.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; states: When the lesser yin pulse is absent, kidney energy is deficient, essence and blood rush uncontrollably, breath is short and forced, rising into the chest and diaphragm, the ancestral qi gathers abnormally, blood stagnates below the heart, yang energy retreats downward, heat returns to the yin aspects, interacting with yin, leading to loss of sensation in the body; this is referred to as &quot;corpse stiffness.&quot; In this case, one should acupuncture the Qi Men and Ju Que points.</p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: The Yin Bai and Da Dun points are pivotal for treating sudden corpse-like unconsciousness, where the pulse remains as usual. The Zhong Ji and Pu Shen points are key for treating dazed states, corpse-like unconsciousness, and pain or discomfort. The Jin Men point is crucial in cases of sudden death from corpse-like unconsciousness.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>In the inner chamber, if the limbs and extremities feel sluggish and this condition persists for a long time; if there is heat, pain in the shins, abdominal distension, or skin pain, one must hold pressure on the affected areas for an extended time. If a person suddenly dies without a pulse and no other signs manifest, this indicates the exhaustion of both yin and yang. One can use a heated iron to press under both armpits to treat corpse rigidity.</p>
<p>Using needles, one should manipulate for over a hundred breaths, then moxibust the philtrum under the nose, which is referred to as the &quot;ghost guest hall&quot;. The &quot;Zhouhou Fang&quot; states that this also treats corpse rigidity. The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; mentions that a fainting condition due to qi can be fatal. When treating at the quze point, insert the needle three tenths of an inch deep, first supplementing and waiting for the qi to recover before reducing; do not lift the hands away and avoid moxibustion. If there is no response, treat the navel as well. Additionally, moxibust the navel with seven strong applications, avoiding needles. These two acupoints can bring someone back to life.</p>
<p>Another method: for treating corpse rigidity, use the yuequan point at eight tenths, supplementing for ten breaths, then reducing once qi is obtained; at the yinbai point, insert the needle three tenths, first supplementing and then reducing, achieving a balance between supplementation and reduction; also apply heat to both sides of the ribs.</p>
<p>For ghost strikes: at the zhigou point, insert two tenths, first supplementing and then reducing, achieving a balance. At the sanli point, supplement for ten breaths, reducing for five. When needling these two points, if qi does not arrive, do not inquire about the number, but needle until qi is present, then withdraw the needle and do not reinsert it. The &quot;Proof of Treatment&quot; states that if someone suddenly has an inability to see due to eye swelling, moxibustion should be applied to the second cervical vertebra and the fifth cervical vertebra for seven strong applications, using small heated clay pellets about the size of half a jujube pit.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ru Men Shi Qin&quot; states: A man suffered from phlegm obstructing the channels, was unaware of his surroundings, and had tightly clenched teeth, rendering all medications ineffective. A physician asked the attendant if there was saliva in the patient&#39;s mouth. The attendant responded: Yes. The physician first prepared a decoction of Fangfeng and Lilu, mixed with powdered gourd stems, to administer it; however, the patient could not swallow it. Then, the physician took a long clam shell, ground off the sharp edges, wrapped its tip in paper, and administered it into the right nostril, causing a gurgling sound as it was swallowed. He repeated this for the left nostril, and the same result occurred. The physician said: It can be treated now. After a while, as no saliva was produced, he proceeded to insert one qian of arsenic into the nose, and suddenly the patient lay back, seemingly in pain. Soon after, he expelled a large amount of thick saliva and regained consciousness. Arsenic should not be used casually; due to the severity of his illness, no other remedy could stimulate him. However, without gourd stems, it should also not be used; it is advisable to treat gently.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Danxi said: &quot;Brother Zheng, nearing sixty, is one who relies on being nurtured and served. He has long suffered from stagnation below, and has also offended against the labor of intimacy. One evening, while ascending to the toilet, both hands became limp, both eyes opened without light, urine flowed uncontrollably, sweat poured like rain, his throat felt like it was being sawed, his breath was very shallow, the pulse was strong yet chaotic, and there was no clear location for the distress, which was extremely frightening. I urgently ordered ginseng paste to be prepared, and first applied moxibustion at the Qihai point, with moxa rolls the size of a little finger, to a total of eighty rolls. The right hand was able to move; after three more rolls, his lips slightly moved, and the ginseng paste was also completed, so I gave him one cup. After midnight, he finished two cups, his eyes could move, and he could only speak and ask for congee after consuming two pounds of it. After five pounds, the diarrhea stopped, and after consuming dozens of pounds, he felt stable.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Essential Readings of Medical Schools&quot; states: &quot;Madam Yang Fanghu suddenly collapsed, and the doctor treated her as if she had suffered a stroke, but it was ineffective. They invited me for a diagnosis. The left pulse was tight, while the right pulse was slippery, large, and soft, indicating a deficiency of the original qi, further aggravated by a pause in eating due to anger. I first used herbs to regulate qi and digest food, which helped release a few black stools. Urgently, I prescribed six gentleman’s herbs with ginger juice in four doses, and the distress facilitated. Furthermore, I used five qian of ginseng, three qian each of astragalus, poria, and pinellia, and two qian each of angelica and other herbs, adjusting and regulating them. After two months, she recovered. This condition is known as &#39;deficiency within,&#39; also combining with &#39;food stagnation.&#39;&quot;<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>In the town, there was a respected gentleman, Zhang Taigeng. In the sixth month of the Bingzi year, during the time just before the Yins, he suddenly lost consciousness, unaware of those around him. After some time had passed, he finally regained consciousness. This was due to excessive consumption of cold foods. When the family was startled, I used the powder from the soap pod, which can help one breathe. I then brought fresh water to irrigate him and subsequently burned sandalwood to fill the room with its fragrance to open his senses, and he eventually came to after a while. I administered a herbal infusion known as the &quot;Ten Flavor Xiangru&quot; to stabilize him. This was a case of heat coupled with deficiency.</p>
<p>Lady Qianxian, wife of Gan Huaiquan, first suffered from pain in her chest and abdomen, and the next day she suddenly collapsed, experiencing cold extremities. A physician suggested using a cow bile pill which was ground and ready for consumption. Upon examining her pulse, I found all six main pulses to be weak, with only slight fluctuations in the qi at the mouth of the pulse. This indicated a fullness in her chest, where yin and yang were obstructed, preventing the flow of qi. As a result, the pulse was weak, while the qi was detectable. I took one tael of dried tangerine peel and sand seeds, eight qian of ginger, and three qian of salt, boiled them into a decoction, and after administering it, she expelled five to six bowls of undigested food, and the six pulses were finally observable. The left guan pulse was prominent, and the pain in her chest and abdomen was severe, indicating that excessive anger had caused her condition. I prepared a decoction with muxiang (costus), green citrus peel, tangerine peel, white atractylodes, and cyperus, and administered two doses, which relieved her pain. For further balance, I used the “Four Gentlemen” formula, adding muxiang and wuyao (lindera) and treated her for over ten days until she recovered. This was a case of both food retention and qi stagnation.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《内经》曰：邪气盛则实，正气夺则虚。夫经之所谓邪者，风寒暑湿燥火，有余之淫邪尔，非若世俗所谓鬼神之妖怪也。病有心虚惊惕，如醉如痴，如有邪鬼所附；或阳明内实，以致登高而歌，弃衣而走，皆痰火之所为，实非鬼妖邪祟之所迷也。古虽有禁咒一科，及龙树咒法之治，皆移精变气之术，但可解疑释惑，以使心神之归正尔，何邪祟之可祛哉！　　丹溪曰：俗云冲恶者，谓冲斥邪恶鬼祟而病也。如病此者，未有不因气血先亏而致者。气血者，心之神也。神既衰乏，邪因而入，理或有之。血气两虚，痰塞心胸，妨碍升降，不得运行，以致十二官各失其职，视听言动，皆为虚妄，以邪治之，其人必死。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　病自心生</p>
<p>　　凡山谷幽隐处所，或有魍魉魑魅，狐精狸怪，及人间多年鸡犬，亦间有成妖，纵使迷人，则不过近于气血虚而正气弱者。正气弱即心邪，心邪则妄见妄闻，妄言妄走，无非邪也。惟邪见邪故有之矣。正人无病者，皆不得见，从可审矣。惟此心一正，则百邪俱避，何邪祟之疑哉！<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　禁咒服药兼治</p>
<p>　　治邪祟病，虽禁咒以释其疑，服药必详虚实痰火轻重调治，则内外合一，其病速愈。若只务巫而不用药，其病不能去，必无可愈之理。若只服药而不用巫以释疑，虽愈效迟。是故内外兼治，斯速效矣，此祝由之所由设也。<br>　　　　　脉候</p>

<p><strong>Flying Corpses and Ghost Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The disease of flying corpses refers to the corpse-related ailments among the five corpses, and is also associated with various malicious spirits causing harm. Its manifestations can vary greatly, ranging from thirty-six to as many as ninety-nine types. Generally, it causes chills and fevers, leading to a state of heaviness and silence, with the afflicted often unaware of their suffering while feeling pervasive malevolence. Over the years, this can accumulate and lead to a state of stagnation, ultimately resulting in death. After one dies, it may impact others to the extent of annihilating entire families. Those who suspect they are experiencing such symptoms should seek urgent treatment.</p>
<p>For any abdominal pain, if one consumes several hot medicinals and the abdomen remains still without relief, yet the breath quickens, this indicates a corpse ailment. One should first take one liter of licorice juice, and after a short while, take an entire dose of Jumei decoction. If one manages to have a bowel movement, they should feel somewhat relieved. This is effective for severe constipation, residual food stagnation, and for women suffering from unpredictable intense menstrual pain.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Ghost Attack</h3>
<p>The illness known as &quot;Ghost Attack&quot; occurs suddenly without warning, causing the person to feel as if pierced by a knife. There is acute, unbearable pain in the chest, sides, and abdomen that cannot be pressed or alleviated. The patient may cough up blood, have blood come from the nose and mouth, or experience internal bleeding; it is also referred to as &quot;Ghost Plague.&quot;</p>
<h3>Sudden Malady</h3>
<p>&quot;Sudden Malady&quot; is akin to being afflicted by evil spirits. It is similar to &quot;Ghost Attack,&quot; and the treatments for both are derived similarly.</p>
<h3>Being Afflicted by Evil</h3>
<p>The patient experiences sudden bloating and discomfort in the heart and abdomen, with either diarrhea or vomiting not occurring, resembling dry cholera. What people commonly refer to as being &quot;afflicted by evil&quot; arises from a lack of mental integrity and excessive fear, leading to an assault by evil spirits, which may attach themselves and cause silence and confusion, resulting in nonsensical speech, slander, and open criticism of others without regard for consequences. When good or bad fortunes are spoken of before they manifest, and the time arrives without any mishap, a person with awareness understands the cause. They may ascend heights or navigate dangers as if on level ground, or they may weep and moan, wishing to avoid others, appearing drunk or mad. Their symptoms can vary widely, but treatment should be tailored according to local customs and practices.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Five Corpses</strong></p>
<p>The flying corpse causes hair to gradually rise without reason, coming suddenly with a sensation of sharp pain in the abdomen and chest, along with shortness of breath and feeling of fullness. The hiding corpse lurks within the flesh and blood of a person; upon contact, it activates, causing the same sensations of abdominal fullness, sharp pain, shortness of breath, and can resurge after healing. The sinking corpse, at the time of onset, also causes abdominal cramping, fullness, and shortness of breath; even after rest, it remains lodged in the person&#39;s organs, resulting in pervasive discomfort. The wind corpse circulates in the four limbs and meridians, showing a cold and erratic presence, silently moving without pain and can be activated by wind. The lurking corpse conceals within the five organs, persisting for years without showing symptoms; once it manifests, it leads to sharp abdominal pain, fullness, and shortness of breath. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are those afflicted by residual corpses, which are the corpses left behind by the five corpses, combined with external malevolent energies that invade the body, causing chills and fever, occasionally abdominal pain and fullness, or lumps that rise, or tension in the back and waist, or a heavy feeling throughout the body, with muddled spirits, making one feel perpetually unwell. Every change in the seasons can lead to severe consequences, and over many years, this gradually leads to stagnation, ultimately resulting in death. After death, the affliction may pass to others, even leading to the extermination of a household, hence it is called corpse affliction. All can be addressed with honeysuckle vine leaves, finely crushed and boiled down to a concentrated juice for daily consumption, three times a day, to heal.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Historical and Contemporary Medical System (Ming - Xu Chunfu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discourse on Evil and Pestilence</strong></p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: When evil qi is excessive, it leads to solidity; when the righteous qi is lost, it results in vacuity. The “evil” referred to in the classics includes wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and excess of fiery evils; it is not like the ghosts and spirits that the common people speak of. Diseases may manifest as a sense of heart-related vacuity, causing fear and astonishment, resembling drunkenness or stupor, as though afflicted by evil spirits; or an excess of yangming may cause one to sing on high or run away without clothes, all stemming from phlegm and fire, not the delusion of ghostly phenomena. Although there were ancient prohibitions and charms, along with the incantations derived from Nāgārjuna, these were merely techniques to transform essence and qi, which can alleviate doubts and restore the mind to its rightful state; thus, how could evil and pestilence be dispelled? </p>
<p>Danxi said: Common saying refers to the “冲恶” (chong&#39;e) which means to repel and reject evil spirits resulting in illness. Those who suffer from this have, without exception, previously experienced depletion of qi and blood. Qi and blood are the spirit of the heart. When the spirit is already weakened, evil can enter; this is a plausible occurrence. When both blood and qi are depleted, and phlegm obstructs the heart and chest, preventing movement and circulation, it leads to the malfunctioning of the twelve organs; perception, speech, and actions become deluded. If one applies evil means to treat such conditions, that person is destined for death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p>In secluded places such as valleys and mountains, there may be spirits and apparitions, fox spirits and strange creatures, as well as animals like chickens and dogs that have transformed into demons over many years. Even if they are enchanting, they merely prey upon those whose vital energy is weakened and whose righteous spirit is faint. When the righteous spirit is weak, the heart becomes disturbed; a disturbed heart leads to delusions in seeing and hearing, to nonsensical words and actions—all are nothing but evil. It is only due to evil perceptions that such things exist. The righteous person, free from illness, cannot perceive these disturbances, and this can be examined.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Prohibition of Evil Spells and Medicine for Combined Treatment</strong></p>
<p>To treat malevolent diseases, even though the prohibition of spells alleviates doubts, medication must carefully consider the balance of deficiency and fullness, phlegm, fire, and their intensity. Only through the unification of internal and external treatments can the illness be resolved swiftly. If one solely relies on sorcery without medicine, the illness cannot be eradicated, and there is no rationale for recovery. Conversely, if one only uses medicine without addressing doubts through sorcery, the healing will be delayed. Hence, a combined approach of internal and external treatment yields rapid effects, which is the foundation of this practice.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Indicators</strong></p>
<p>A pulse that is occasionally sparse and then rapid, sometimes large and then small, or irregularly hurried or knotted indicates evil pulses. A tense and urgent pulse signifies escaping spirits, while a slippery pulse indicates ghost affliction.</p>
<p><strong>Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br>【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Malevolent Influence</strong></p>
<p>Manifestations of malevolent influence occur due to offending unnatural energies, suddenly causing hands and feet to feel cold, skin to develop bumps, a darkening of the face, disorientation, or nonsensical speech, along with clenched jaws and silenced mouths. Sometimes, there’s dizziness, collapse, and an inability to recognize people. This includes sudden fainting, guest disturbance, spirit flight, ghostly strikes, mourning inquiries, temple visits, or tomb climbing—all indicating such ailments. Administer Suhe Xiang pills, observe as the patient slightly revives, and then give the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder, which is named the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>In case of possession</strong></p>
<p>For urgent treatment, one must not delay even for a moment. Just as possession in a person is indeed due to phlegm. The prescription includes three qian of ginseng, three qian of white atractylodes, and three qian of pinellia, along with one qian of coarse dried fruit and one qian of dried orange peel, to be decocted in water for oral administration. The brilliance of this formula lies in the coarse dried fruit, which can open up the orifices and allows the combined herbs to directly enter the heart, completely dispelling the stagnation caused by phlegm. Once the phlegm is expelled, what remains of the evil?</p>
<p><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Returning the Soul Decoction</strong> (from Zhang Zhongjing, same below)<br>For sudden death caused by spirit disturbance.<br>Two liang of ephedra without nodes, originally four liang.<br>Seventy pieces of peeled apricot kernels (double kernels).<br>One liang of roasted licorice.<br>The three ingredients above should be boiled in eight sheng of water until three sheng remain, then strain and divide for drinking. It broadly treats various disturbances.  </p>
<p><strong>Another formula</strong><br>A handful of chive roots,<br>Two pieces of black plum,<br>Half sheng of dried wild ginger, stir-fried.<br>Boil the three ingredients above in ten dou of water, and have the sick person taste the decanted liquid three times; if it floats, the person is alive, if it sinks, they are dead.

<p>For treating sudden evil guests in soldiers, with five corpses entering the abdomen, and spirits stabbing spirits; for those afflicted by witchcraft, vomiting blood, passing blood, and experiencing sudden pain in the heart and abdomen, along with a full abdomen, and suffering from cold and heat toxins, illnesses lasting six to seven days.</p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Two taels each of realgar, cassia heart, and wild rue</li>
<li>Three fen of wild yam</li>
<li>One tael each of cinnabar and Sichuan pepper</li>
<li>One fen each of rhizome of veratrum and paradise seed </li>
<li>Five fen of aconite</li>
</ul>
<p>The nine ingredients above should be prepared as follows: treat the paradise seed separately, while the rest should be ground and sifted together. Combine with the paradise seed, pound them well together, and store in a copper container tightly sealed, keeping it from exposure. </p>
<p>For sudden illnesses, take five scoops of the mixture in water; it can be increased to half a scoop if needed, and reduce by half for the elderly or young. If the illness affects the head, it manifests as nosebleeds; if it is in the diaphragm, it leads to vomiting; if below the diaphragm, it results in diarrhea; if in the limbs, it causes sweating. This is akin to pouring water on snow—all symptoms should resolve effectively. It is advisable to keep this formula secret, as it should not be passed on casually.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the flying symptoms do not diminish, continue with the fire treatment as before. Use chicken feathers to sweep away, combine jujube paste and pills like millet grains, and take one pill on an empty stomach at dawn, gradually increasing to one more pill as needed. Previously, magnets and gold teeth were not used, but now they have been added. Those who take this will definitely vomit bile within five doses; if overdosed, it will self-regulate. Initially, the pill should be the size of millet, gradually increasing to the size of a small bean and stopping there, without exceeding this size. If the medicine causes discomfort, drink a decoction of stephania root, and it will soon resolve. If needing to antidote poison, eat undercooked, boiled fatty pork. For those with long-standing malaria turning into swellings and near death, take one pill to induce recovery, and the mother of malaria will also improve. For lumps and accumulations, take one pill washed down with porridge. For those feeling slight warmth in the heart and lower abdomen, open the mouth and use porridge to wash down a knife-shaped pill or powder. Store the knife-shaped powder in a crimson pouch and tie it on the left arm for men and the right arm for women; this is exceptionally effective to avoid miasma and epidemics.</p>
<p>The Evading Evil Pill treats clashes with malevolent spirits, strange plagues, and calamities caused by nine-tailed fox spirits in the mountains and valleys. Ingredients include: one tael each of ginseng, red poria, distant志, ghost arrow feathers, stone calamus, white atractylodes, and苍 atractylodes, five qian of peach wood, and three qian each of realgar and vermilion, and one qian each of cattle bile and musk. Grind these into a powder, mix with wine to form pills the size of longan, coat with gold leaf, and take each pill with wood fragrance decoction before sleep. No evil will dare approach the body; additionally, keeping five to seven pills stored in a crimson pouch suspended in the bed tent is particularly effective.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p>For thirty years of &quot;qi zha&quot;: Take half a pound of fermented bean heart and one unit of fresh pepper, add two liters of water, and boil until reduced to half a liter.

<p>Regarding acupuncture:</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that when a person is worried or overly thoughtful, it harms the heart and can cause loss of vital essence due to shock, leading to sweating from the heart. If one encounters the influence of the lesser yin above, and the heavens do not provide sufficient support, it results in three deficiencies and a loss of spirit. The heart is the official of the sovereign, from which the spirit emanates. When the spirit is lost and cannot gather, it can lead to a fire that does not arrive in time, resulting in encounters with malevolent spirits that cause sudden death. The treatment involves needling the pathway of the hand&#39;s lesser yang, specifically at the Yang Pool point, and also needling the Heart Shu point for recovery.</p>
<p>In general, excessive eating, fatigue, or overindulgence harms the spleen; drinking to fullness can lead to sweating from the stomach, and drunken debauchery can cause sweating from the spleen. If one encounters the influence of the greater yin above, and the heavens do not provide adequate support, this results in the same three deficiencies and a loss of spirit. The spleen serves as the advisor, from which intention emerges. When the spirit is lost and cannot gather, it can lead to an encounter with earth that does not arrive in time, resulting in encounters with malevolent spirits that cause sudden death. Treatment can involve needling the pathway of the foot&#39;s greater yang, specifically at the Chong Yang point, and also needling the Spleen Shu point for recovery.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>&quot;The Heart Method of Danxi&quot; states: Diseases of deficiency and phlegm resemble sinister influences. The blood and qi are the spirit of the body; when the spirit becomes weak, evils can enter, which may logically occur. If both blood and qi are depleted and phlegm obstructs the middle burner, it hinders the ascending and descending processes, causing the twelve officials to lose their functions. Perception and actions become delusional, and treating it with evils will surely lead to death. </p>
<p>A young man, during the hot month, became extremely thirsty after excessive labor and indulged in plum juice. Furthermore, he experienced intense fright three or four times, speaking and seeing irrationally, with symptoms resembling evil spirits. The pulse on both hands was weak, thin, and rapid. I said: The rapid pulse indicates deficiency heat, while the thin pulse indicates fright. Additionally, the sour plum juice had stifled the middle jiao. Therefore, to nourish deficiency, clear heat, and guide out the phlegm stagnation, the illness could be stabilized. </p>
<p>I prescribed ginseng, atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, scutellaria, and lima bean, boiling them into a strong decoction, and added bamboo juice and ginger juice. After ten days, there was no effect, and everyone thought the prescription was unsuitable. I palpated the pulse and realized the deficiency remained unaddressed and phlegm had not been resolved, so I instructed to add ginger juice (jingli) to the previous formula. After taking it for another ten days, he then stabilized.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

On the day of Gengshen, a woman from my family dreamed of two figures with gray hair, one in front and the other behind, each holding something. The one in front asked, “Have you arrived?” The one behind replied, “I have arrived.” Upon striking down, there was a sudden explosive sound, and she was then plagued by a nightmare, waking to a sharp pain in her heart that was unbearable, feeling muddled for a time. I suddenly recalled that the Shenjing Dan was related to this incident, so I took three pills and made her take them, and shortly thereafter, she was free of illness. She remarked that after taking the medicine, the pain ceased, and she regained her senses, feeling as she normally would. In later encounters, if there was any evil spirit present, giving her one or two doses would always yield results.

I examined her left pulse, which was large and without order; her right pulse had three beats, faint and difficult to detect. This was indeed like having two different people for her hands, as this evil relied upon the pulse. I tied the two large toes together, and used moxa to apply heat to both for seven sessions; the evil spirit then wept and sought to leave. I prescribed a formula to regulate Qi and calm the stomach, adding Taonu, and within a few days, the affliction was eliminated.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p>The governance of Yangming in the heavens, under the influence of the dual energies, causes severe calamity, leading to the people dying suddenly. [Note: The dual energies refer to the two types of fire in the roles of ruler and minister, so during severe calamity, there is a tendency for sudden death.] The governance of Shaoyang in the heavens, influenced by the three energies, also leads to the people dying suddenly.

[Note: Confusion and distress are illnesses of the lungs. Excessive heat harms the essence, contributing to sudden death.] When Shaoyang descends, it brings sudden conditions, spasms, and sudden death. [Note: This is a common issue in winter ailments.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: In the realm of the厥阴 wind-wood controlling the heavens, the少阳 fire resides in the springs; wood and fire nurture each other, hence fire acts with violence. The少阳 governs the pivot, thus the mechanisms are swift.</p>
<p><strong>Great Theory of Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse is like panting, it is called violent厥. Violent厥 refers to the state of being unable to speak to others. <strong>Note</strong>: Like panting, the pulse is slippery and rapid; this indicates obstruction of phlegm and water.</p>
<p><strong>Essential Subtle Pulse Theory</strong></p>
<p>A pulse that is floating and scattered signifies dizziness and fainting. <strong>Note</strong>: This indicates the yin is counteracting the yang.</p>
<p><strong>Theory of True Organs of the Jade Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>When a sudden emptiness arises within the body, and the five organs are completely closed, the pulse pathways are blocked, and the qi cannot circulate, it is akin to falling into a pit; there can be no timeframe for this. <strong>Note</strong>: When wind and cold evils invade the body, the essence and qi are abruptly depleted, hence the sudden emptiness leads to the closure of the five organs&#39; qi, blocking the pulse pathways, so that qi cannot circulate, much like the urgency of falling into a pit; it is difficult to anticipate the time of occurrence. </p>
<p>If the pulse completely ceases to come, it resembles a person&#39;s one breath: The &quot;Essential Questions&quot; of the True Organs of the Jade Mechanism suggests: &quot;According to a person&#39;s one breath, the pulse arrives five or six times; why would this be deemed death? The character &#39;breath&#39; must be a mistake. It should be &#39;exhale.&#39;&quot; Five or six pulses may not show in the physical body, but even if the true organs are not visible, death can still occur. <strong>Note</strong>: In emergencies, when the pulse does not come, it signifies that the life force has been extinguished internally. Five or six pulses indicate that the evil qi is strong externally; even if the true organs are not visible, death may still happen.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What is the reason for those who suddenly die or fall ill? The Master of the Few replied: The three deficiencies cause sudden death and illness. When one possesses the three fullnesses, malevolent forces cannot harm a person. Being in a year of decline, encountering a month of emptiness, and missing the harmony of the season, one is harmed by the harmful winds; this is called the three deficiencies. In a year of abundance, meeting a full moon, and obtaining harmony with the season, even if faced with harmful winds or malevolent energies, one cannot be endangered. </p>
<p>[Note: To be in a year of decline implies that the six energies administered by heaven are insufficient. To encounter a month of emptiness happens at the time when the lunar territories are empty. Missing the harmony of the season means the energies of the four seasons are not aligned correctly. The protective energy interacts with heaven and earth, corresponds with the sun and moon; thus, a year of deficiency, a month of emptiness, and a discordant season all indicate the abnormality of protective energy. When this protective energy is deficient, the channels become loose, allowing malevolent energies to penetrate within, resulting in sudden illness and death.]<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Thunder God said: How can we know a person has not been ill yet dies suddenly? The Yellow Emperor replied: When the great energy enters the internal organs, the person dies suddenly without having been ill. The Thunder God asked: How can we know a person appears to have recovered from a minor illness yet dies suddenly? The Yellow Emperor said: If red appears on both cheeks, as large as a thumb, although the illness seems minor, that person will surely die. If black appears on the courtyard, as large as a thumb, that person will die suddenly without being ill.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The great energy entering the organs is the external evil that enters the internal organs, hence death occurs without prior illness.

<p><strong>Sudden Stroke and Collapse</strong></p>
<p>A sudden stroke refers to a condition where one suddenly loses consciousness, resembling a dead body, yet the breath does not cease, and the pulse remains active. Sometimes the pulse is chaotic, sometimes strong then weak, or fine but persistent, while the chest remains warm. In cases of heat stroke causing fainting, one must quickly support the person in a cool place, and avoid ice water. Instead, use a cloth dipped in warm soup to warm the abdomen and the area just below the navel. Continue with the warm soup to cover the abdomen until warmth is restored, which will gradually help the person regain consciousness. If hot soup is not available, it is preferable to scoop warm soil from the ground to apply on the abdomen, replacing it when it cools. The ancient method, without soup, involves scooping hot soil onto the navel and creating a hollow space for the person to urinate into, as a substitute for soup, and continue with bamboo leaf Baihu Decoction.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Sudden Death</strong>  </p>
<p>Bian Que and the &quot;Shoulder-Back Prescription&quot; mention that being struck by evil and sudden death are similar in nature, and treatments for both should be referred to and utilized. When one has died, pound fresh calamus roots, squeeze the juice, and administer it; recovery will be immediate. </p>
<p>For sudden stroke, cadaveric rigidity, distress due to obstruction, stroke, heatstroke, and similar conditions, all should be treated to induce evacuation. Zhongjing states: to resolve distress due to obstruction, one must induce profuse sweating; hence, the Return the Soul Decoction uses ephedra and cinnamon twig, while the Clear the Soul Decoction employs schizopepon, and various treatments for sudden strokes utilize soapberry and pinellia (for nasal inhalation), as well as cuminum and arsenic rubbed on the gums to expel phlegm. These methods aim to open the upper energizer, allowing the pathogenic factors on the surface to circulate. </p>
<p>For heatstroke, one should avoid cool water, as it may close the pore openings, which is aligned with this principle. In mountainous areas, for those stricken suddenly by evil, apply moxa to the navel where a hundred vital points converge; blow soapberry powder into the nostrils; or administer chives juice into the ears.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Ben Shi Fang states: It is said in the world that conditions related to Qi, although not found in medical texts, can occur due to sudden joy harming Yang, sudden anger harming Yin, and prolonged sadness or disappointment causing Qi to be excessive and counterflowing. Many ailments arise from these cases, leading to symptoms like excessive salivation, tightness of the jaw, and conditions resembling stroke. This can lead to fatal outcomes. In the year of the Yang wood in the Yuan You period, my mother suffered from such a misfortune, a lingering sorrow to this day. She had a vegetarian diet and was weak in Qi and blood, having grieved over the loss of her son. One day, she experienced Qi counterflow, tightness of the jaw and excessive salivation. A local doctor diagnosed it as a stroke, gave her a strong purge, and she died that evening. I have held this grief ever since. Whenever I encounter such symptoms, I quickly administer Su He Wan and she recovers, after which I adjust treatment according to the heat or cold without fail. </p>
<p>Qi disorders arise when Qi does not return to its source, resulting in conditions resembling stroke, leading to faintness and tight jaw, but without phlegm, so one must not mistakenly use wind-dispelling medications or laxatives. First, use ginger juice with warm decoction to adjust Su He Xiang Wan; next, apply Qi-clearing decoction or Da Liu Qi Yin, adding Shi Chang Pu to smooth the Qi for recovery; thereafter, use Zhong Ding Tang with Mu Xiang to harmonize the center and restore Qi to its path. If this does not adjust properly, it leads to Qi counterflow and the emergence of altered symptoms.&quot;<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Sudden Stroke and Convulsion</strong>  </p>
<p>The classics state: Sudden illness and death are all attributed to fire. Commentary notes: This is because the nature of fire is swift and fierce. Therefore, the initial treatment should use medications that are neither cold nor hot, neither descending nor ascending; in severe cases, they can indeed treat. Common distinctions include wind stroke, Qi disturbance, food stagnation, cold, heat, dampness, and adverse effects. However, if one suddenly collapses, is unconscious, has phlegm obstructing the throat making sounds, or exhibits crooked mouth and eyes, paralysis of limbs, hemiplegia, or the six pulses being sunken, or if there is swelling beneath the fingers, then sesame oil, ginger juice, and bamboo sap can be mixed with Suhexiang pills. If the mouth is closed, pry it open to administer, or use San Sheng drink one or two ounces, plus one ounce of ginseng, decocted and mixed with two or three cups of bamboo sap and a little ginger juice.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the obstruction cannot be relieved, do not administer the medication. Immediately take raw Pinellia and grind it into a powder, then blow it into the nostrils. Alternatively, use fine herbs like Asarum, Soapberry, or Acorus, grinding them into powder to blow into the nose until sneezing occurs, which can lead to recovery. This method can help assess the severity of the illness, thus determining if it is treatable. If the mouth is open and the hands are relaxed with involuntary urination, it indicates extreme deficiency and loss of Yang, requiring the immediate use of large quantities of ginseng and astragalus for nourishment, along with moxibustion on the lower abdomen.</p>
<p>For copious phlegm and drool, it is advisable to induce vomiting. An urgent remedy is the diluted salve: take four pieces of Soapberry that are plump and unblemished and remove the black skin; one tael of bright alum, finely powdered and mixed. Use five fen for light cases and three characters for heavier ones, dissolved in warm water and ingested. There is also the Bixia powder: select high-quality stone green, grind and sift, and further grind with water to fly away impurities. Take two to three qian of this, mix with three to four beans of borneol, and combine with fresh mint juice and warm wine for ingestion. Neither of these medicines should induce strong vomiting, but rather gently promote the flow of saliva from the corners of the mouth, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it is said that if the mouth is wide open and unable to close, the hands are relaxed and without coordination, the eyes are closed indicating liver dysfunction, involuntary urination indicating kidney dysfunction, and the voice resembles snoring indicating lung dysfunction, these are all signs of being untreatable. However, if not all five signs are present, taking ginseng and astragalus paste promptly, along with moxibustion on the lower abdomen, may still lead to survival.</p>
<p>If a patient exhibits symptoms of stiff posture, vomiting clear froth, shaking their head uncontrollably, flushed face, beads of sweat like pearls, or if the face is red-black, with closed eyes and an open mouth, panting and involuntary urination, these cases are untreatable. Among various patients, whether unconscious or conscious, whether the illness is recent or prolonged, those who vomit purple-red substances are likely fatal.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Transmission of the Heart Formula&quot; states: To treat a man or woman who suddenly faints with a flow of saliva, one must immediately assist them into a warm room, help them to sit upright, and place a good vinegar and charcoal incense in front of them, allowing the vinegar&#39;s aroma to rush into their mouth and nose. After a while, the saliva that gathers in the heart will naturally return; those lightly affected will immediately regain consciousness, while those heavily affected will also awaken. However, one must not let even a drop of soup or water enter their throat. If they do consume soup or water, the saliva will remain in the heart&#39;s channels and cannot be expelled, inevitably leading to a state of debilitation.</p>
<p>In the case of a person afflicted by wind, the six pulses are often deeply suppressed, though there may be pulses that surge beneath the fingers in a vigorous manner. A floating and slow pulse is auspicious, a firm and large or urgent pulse is ominous. A floating and slow pulse indicates cold, a weak and large pulse indicates summer heat; if it&#39;s not summer heat, it indicates deficiency. A floating and muddy pulse indicates dampness, a floating and large pulse indicates wind, while a floating and rapid pulse without heat also indicates wind. </p>
<p>Furthermore, a thin and rapid, floating and tight, or sinking and slow pulse all reflect the condition of the Qi. Wind corresponds to the external response of the person, while Qi corresponds to the external Qi. A large and surging pulse indicates heat, and a slippery pulse indicates phlegm. Whether it is floating and slippery, sinking and slippery, or thin and deficient, these all indicate deficiency combined with phlegm. One must further observe the seasonal and monthly changes as well as the individual&#39;s daily habits, correlating these with clear signs to ascertain the primary condition for treatment.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Methods of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sudden Death</strong></p>
<p>Treating death is like a person&#39;s sudden demise, unresponsive to worldly matters, unable to speak due to a stroke, or perhaps afflicted by the spirits, or confronted by mountain demons, collapsing at once, unresponsive to the world. Such ailments are caused by邪气 within, with phlegm clouding the heart&#39;s pathways. Strange illnesses often stem from phlegm; there is no need for panic. Treat the phlegm, and the illness will resolve itself. However, where邪 gathers, the vital energy must be weak; using phlegm-dissolving medicine and combining it with restorative ingredients will clear the illness as if swept away, and the deceased can be revived.</p>
<p>The formula uses five qian of white atractylodes, three qian each of ginseng, poria, pinellia, and tian nanxing, one qian of white mustard seed, five fen of fresh aconite, and a large piece of fresh ginger squeezed for juice, mixed with half water and half wine, totaling two bowls, boiled down to eight parts, then taken. Externally, use soapberry thorns ground into powder. When grinding the soapberry thorns, first take a piece of paper, completely wet it, and seal it over the nostrils of the person nearby; then grind it into a fine powder. Take a spoonful with an goose feather tube and blow it into the patient’s nostrils, which will surely induce sneezing. With the prior medicine administered, they will awaken and must expel phlegm, amounting to half a basin or a whole basin, resembling glue or broth, in colors of yellow, black, blue, or red. The person will naturally feel drowsy and should not be startled; let them sleep peacefully. Upon waking, administer one qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and white peony, five qian of white atractylodes, three qian each of poria and white mustard seed, five fen each of dried tangerine peel and licorice, boiled and taken as one dose for complete recovery. This is one method of treating sudden death.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>盖人之中邪，必由元气之虚，邪遂乘虚而入，故用人参以助其正气，而以半夏、白芥子以祛邪与痰，天南星尤能人心而祛邪，用附子猛烈之将，单刀直入，邪自惊退，故一下口而邪即外越上涌出矣。然邪出之后，当纯补胃气，故又不用祛痰之剂，而竟用健脾补胃之品也。更有死证治法，如尸厥之证，亦是气虚，当用人参一两，白朮、半夏、茯苓各五钱，菖蒲一钱，陈皮五分治之。虽同是中邪，然前证是阳邪，此乃遇阴邪也。阳邪者日间遇之，阴邪者夜间遇之也。后方虽亦用人参以补正，而终不用南星之类，直入其心中也。<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person is afflicted by evil influences, it is necessarily due to a deficiency of vital energy, allowing the evil to invade through the void. Therefore, ginseng is used to strengthen the righteous energy, while pinellia and white mustard seed are utilized to dispel evil and phlegm. Tian Nanxing is particularly effective at dispelling the heart&#39;s disturbances and expelling evil; with the potent action of aconite, it forcefully penetrates to drive the evil away, causing it to retreat immediately as it escapes upward from the mouth. However, once the evil has exited, it is essential to purely replenish the stomach’s energy; thus, phlegm-dispelling agents are not used, and instead, strengthening the spleen and nourishing the stomach is prioritized. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are treatments for fatal conditions, such as for the syndrome of corpse-like stagnation, which is also due to qi deficiency. For this, one should use one tael of ginseng, five qian each of atractylodes, pinellia, and poria, along with one qian of calamus and five fen of dried tangerine peel for treatment. Although the underlying issue is an evil influence, the former condition involves yang evil, while this pertains to encountering yin evil. Yang evil occurs during the day, whereas yin evil occurs at night. In the later formula, while ginseng is also used for supplementation, there is no use of Tian Nanxing or similar herbs, targeting directly the heart&#39;s interior.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one cannot speak, one can also use powdered soapberry and blow it. If the first two symptoms are accompanied by involuntary urination and excessive voiding, then it is often impossible to cure; otherwise, all can be treated with a single dose for revival. The above two symptoms are methods for treating death. By drawing parallels and understanding strategies, everything falls into place. Generally, the methods for eliminating pathogens are sufficient in two categories. Next, one should consider the severity of the illness and the amount of medicine used to determine the right approach.</p>
<p>If a person suddenly sees a ghost and collapses, whether in a shrine or beside a coffin, and accidentally encounters the chilly energy of a corpse, being afflicted by the ghostly influence and becoming unresponsive, one should use the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting. They will surely expel phlegm like a gushing spring, pouring out abundantly, and if the ghost runs away, that is sufficient. If after vomiting they still see the ghost, it indicates that the phlegm has not been completely expelled. Thus, use the gourd stem powder again until the ghost is no longer seen. </p>
<p>After that, take one tael of white atractylodes, five qian of poria, one qian each of white peony, shenchu, and powdered ginger, and five fen of dried tangerine peel, and decoct them in water to drink. This method can treat impoverished individuals.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

If they cannot swallow, lift their head and pour it in until they swallow, and shortly thereafter, they will recover. If they haven’t healed, give them three additional pills, and when the stomach gurgles, they will vomit and recover. If the mouth is unresponsive, you must break their teeth to administer it.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fuzi Lijun Decoction</strong> treats cold in the five internal organs, stiffness of the limbs, inability to speak, and loss of voice. In ancient times, there was a warrior guarding the borders who fell ill outside his snowy tent. He was treated with this medicine in two doses and subsequently recovered. </p>
<p>Ingredients: Large Fuzi (processed, removing the skin and navel) equal parts of Ginseng, processed dried Ginger, roasted Licorice, and Bai Zhu.</p>
<p>Grind the above into a powder. Each dose is four large coins, mixed with one and a half cups of water, decocted until down to seven parts, then strain and take on an empty stomach. If the patient is unable to speak, administer it through the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Separate Prescription</strong></p>
<p>For those who have suffered from sunstroke and can’t be cooled down, cooling will lead to death. Use dried grass to tie around the navel of the sunstroke victim, and have two or three people urinate over it to warm it up. Hot mud mixed with the dried grass can also be applied; alternatively, place a warm bowl or press onto a vehicle&#39;s water tank to warm the sunstroke victim. You must ensure they urinate, as this is essential. If there is no decoction, the process must still be carried out to ensure warmth. Avoid allowing the urine or vehicle&#39;s tank to cool down, as that may cause harm. If the sunstroke occurred during the summer, hot mud and warm vehicle tanks can also be utilized.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the &quot;Ling Shu Jing&quot;: The sun is rooted in the utmost yin and is linked at the life gate. The life gate is the eye. The sun represents opening; when it is blocked, the flesh and joints become unraveled and sudden disease arises. Therefore, for sudden diseases, it is important to target the sun and observe excess or deficiency. The skin and flesh appear weak and fragile. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: If an evil guest invades the channels of the hands and feet of the lesser yin, greater yin, and the foot yangming, all five channels converge in the ear, with the upper channel in the left angle. If all five channels are exhausted, it causes the body’s pulses to move erratically and the body loses awareness, resembling a corpse; sometimes referred to as a stiff corpse. One should puncture the inner side of the big toe nail and the tip resembling a chive leaf. Then, puncture the sole of the foot, followed by the middle finger nail on each side. Next, puncture the inner side of the hand&#39;s big toe and the palm&#39;s heart at the tip of the lesser yin sharp bone, each punctured once, and it will be effective immediately. If it does not stop, blow into both ears with a bamboo tube, cut one inch of hair from the left angle, burn it, and drink a cup of good wine. If unable to drink, administer it immediately.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot;: In a case of corpse-like rigidity where the person does not recognize others, the pulse continues as usual; the hidden white and great dun points are to be targeted. In a dazed state of corpse-like rigidity with a headache, the midpoint and the foot-shen point are to be targeted. For sudden death resembling a corpse, the golden gate should be targeted.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the inner chamber, if the limbs and extremities feel sluggish and this condition persists for a long time; if there is heat, pain in the shins, abdominal distension, or skin pain, one must hold pressure on the affected areas for an extended time. If a person suddenly dies without a pulse and no other signs manifest, this indicates the exhaustion of both yin and yang. One can use a heated iron to press under both armpits to treat corpse rigidity.</p>
<p>Using needles, one should manipulate for over a hundred breaths, then moxibust the philtrum under the nose, which is referred to as the &quot;ghost guest hall&quot;. The &quot;Zhouhou Fang&quot; states that this also treats corpse rigidity. The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; mentions that a fainting condition due to qi can be fatal. When treating at the quze point, insert the needle three tenths of an inch deep, first supplementing and waiting for the qi to recover before reducing; do not lift the hands away and avoid moxibustion. If there is no response, treat the navel as well. Additionally, moxibust the navel with seven strong applications, avoiding needles. These two acupoints can bring someone back to life.</p>
<p>Another method: for treating corpse rigidity, use the yuequan point at eight tenths, supplementing for ten breaths, then reducing once qi is obtained; at the yinbai point, insert the needle three tenths, first supplementing and then reducing, achieving a balance between supplementation and reduction; also apply heat to both sides of the ribs.</p>
<p>For ghost strikes: at the zhigou point, insert two tenths, first supplementing and then reducing, achieving a balance. At the sanli point, supplement for ten breaths, reducing for five. When needling these two points, if qi does not arrive, do not inquire about the number, but needle until qi is present, then withdraw the needle and do not reinsert it. The &quot;Proof of Treatment&quot; states that if someone suddenly has an inability to see due to eye swelling, moxibustion should be applied to the second cervical vertebra and the fifth cervical vertebra for seven strong applications, using small heated clay pellets about the size of half a jujube pit.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

The physician first prepared a decoction of Fangfeng and Lilu, mixed with powdered gourd stems, to administer it; however, the patient could not swallow it.

He repeated this for the left nostril, and the same result occurred. The physician said: It can be treated now. After a while, as no saliva was produced, he proceeded to insert one qian of arsenic into the nose, and suddenly the patient lay back, seemingly in pain.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the town, there was a respected gentleman, Zhang Taigeng. In the sixth month of the Bingzi year, during the time just before the Yins, he suddenly lost consciousness, unaware of those around him. After some time had passed, he finally regained consciousness. This was due to excessive consumption of cold foods. When the family was startled, I used the powder from the soap pod, which can help one breathe. I then brought fresh water to irrigate him and subsequently burned sandalwood to fill the room with its fragrance to open his senses, and he eventually came to after a while. I administered a herbal infusion known as the &quot;Ten Flavor Xiangru&quot; to stabilize him. This was a case of heat coupled with deficiency.</p>
<p>Lady Qianxian, wife of Gan Huaiquan, first suffered from pain in her chest and abdomen, and the next day she suddenly collapsed, experiencing cold extremities. A physician suggested using a cow bile pill which was ground and ready for consumption. Upon examining her pulse, I found all six main pulses to be weak, with only slight fluctuations in the qi at the mouth of the pulse. This indicated a fullness in her chest, where yin and yang were obstructed, preventing the flow of qi. As a result, the pulse was weak, while the qi was detectable. I took one tael of dried tangerine peel and sand seeds, eight qian of ginger, and three qian of salt, boiled them into a decoction, and after administering it, she expelled five to six bowls of undigested food, and the six pulses were finally observable. The left guan pulse was prominent, and the pain in her chest and abdomen was severe, indicating that excessive anger had caused her condition. I prepared a decoction with muxiang (costus), green citrus peel, tangerine peel, white atractylodes, and cyperus, and administered two doses, which relieved her pain. For further balance, I used the “Four Gentlemen” formula, adding muxiang and wuyao (lindera) and treated her for over ten days until she recovered. This was a case of both food retention and qi stagnation.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

Its manifestations can vary greatly, ranging from thirty-six to as many as ninety-nine types. Generally, it causes chills and fevers, leading to a state of heaviness and silence, with the afflicted often unaware of their suffering while feeling pervasive malevolence. Over the years, this can accumulate and lead to a state of stagnation, ultimately resulting in death. After one dies, it may impact others to the extent of annihilating entire families. Those who suspect they are experiencing such symptoms should seek urgent treatment. For any abdominal pain, if one consumes several hot medicinals and the abdomen remains still without relief, yet the breath quickens, this indicates a corpse ailment. One should first take one liter of licorice juice, and after a short while, take an entire dose of Jumei decoction. If one manages to have a bowel movement, they should feel somewhat relieved. This is effective for severe constipation, residual food stagnation, and for women suffering from unpredictable intense menstrual pain."},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"### Ghost Attack The illness known as \"Ghost Attack\" occurs suddenly without warning, causing the person to feel as if pierced by a knife. There is acute, unbearable pain in the chest, sides, and abdomen that cannot be pressed or alleviated. The patient may cough up blood, have blood come from the nose and mouth, or experience internal bleeding; it is also referred to as \"Ghost Plague.\" ### Sudden Malady \"Sudden Malady\" is akin to being afflicted by evil spirits. It is similar to \"Ghost Attack,\" and the treatments for both are derived similarly. ### Being Afflicted by Evil The patient experiences sudden bloating and discomfort in the heart and abdomen, with either diarrhea or vomiting not occurring, resembling dry cholera. What people commonly refer to as being \"afflicted by evil\" arises from a lack of mental integrity and excessive fear, leading to an assault by evil spirits, which may attach themselves and cause silence and confusion, resulting in nonsensical speech, slander, and open criticism of others without regard for consequences. When good or bad fortunes are spoken of before they manifest, and the time arrives without any mishap, a person with awareness understands the cause. They may ascend heights or navigate dangers as if on level ground, or they may weep and moan, wishing to avoid others, appearing drunk or mad. Their symptoms can vary widely, but treatment should be tailored according to local customs and practices."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"**The Five Corpses** The flying corpse causes hair to gradually rise without reason, coming suddenly with a sensation of sharp pain in the abdomen and chest, along with shortness of breath and feeling of fullness. The hiding corpse lurks within the flesh and blood of a person; upon contact, it activates, causing the same sensations of abdominal fullness, sharp pain, shortness of breath, and can resurge after healing. The sinking corpse, at the time of onset, also causes abdominal cramping, fullness, and shortness of breath; even after rest, it remains lodged in the person's organs, resulting in pervasive discomfort. The wind corpse circulates in the four limbs and meridians, showing a cold and erratic presence, silently moving without pain and can be activated by wind. The lurking corpse conceals within the five organs, persisting for years without showing symptoms; once it manifests, it leads to sharp abdominal pain, fullness, and shortness of breath. Additionally, there are those afflicted by residual corpses, which are the corpses left behind by the five corpses, combined with external malevolent energies that invade the body, causing chills and fever, occasionally abdominal pain and fullness, or lumps that rise, or tension in the back and waist, or a heavy feeling throughout the body, with muddled spirits, making one feel perpetually unwell. Every change in the seasons can lead to severe consequences, and over many years, this gradually leads to stagnation, ultimately resulting in death. After death, the affliction may pass to others, even leading to the extermination of a household, hence it is called corpse affliction. All can be addressed with honeysuckle vine leaves, finely crushed and boiled down to a concentrated juice for daily consumption, three times a day, to heal."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**The Historical and Contemporary Medical System (Ming - Xu Chunfu)** **Discourse on Evil and Pestilence** The Inner Canon states: When evil qi is excessive, it leads to solidity; when the righteous qi is lost, it results in vacuity. The “evil” referred to in the classics includes wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and excess of fiery evils; it is not like the ghosts and spirits that the common people speak of. Diseases may manifest as a sense of heart-related vacuity, causing fear and astonishment, resembling drunkenness or stupor, as though afflicted by evil spirits; or an excess of yangming may cause one to sing on high or run away without clothes, all stemming from phlegm and fire, not the delusion of ghostly phenomena. Although there were ancient prohibitions and charms, along with the incantations derived from Nāgārjuna, these were merely techniques to transform essence and qi, which can alleviate doubts and restore the mind to its rightful state; thus, how could evil and pestilence be dispelled? Danxi said: Common saying refers to the “冲恶” (chong'e) which means to repel and reject evil spirits resulting in illness. Those who suffer from this have, without exception, previously experienced depletion of qi and blood. Qi and blood are the spirit of the heart. When the spirit is already weakened, evil can enter; this is a plausible occurrence. When both blood and qi are depleted, and phlegm obstructs the heart and chest, preventing movement and circulation, it leads to the malfunctioning of the twelve organs; perception, speech, and actions become deluded. If one applies evil means to treat such conditions, that person is destined for death."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"**Sickness Arises from the Heart** In secluded places such as valleys and mountains, there may be spirits and apparitions, fox spirits and strange creatures, as well as animals like chickens and dogs that have transformed into demons over many years. Even if they are enchanting, they merely prey upon those whose vital energy is weakened and whose righteous spirit is faint. When the righteous spirit is weak, the heart becomes disturbed; a disturbed heart leads to delusions in seeing and hearing, to nonsensical words and actions—all are nothing but evil. It is only due to evil perceptions that such things exist. The righteous person, free from illness, cannot perceive these disturbances, and this can be examined. With a single correction of the heart, all evils will naturally withdraw; what suspicion remains of malevolent spirits?"},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"**Prohibition of Evil Spells and Medicine for Combined Treatment** To treat malevolent diseases, even though the prohibition of spells alleviates doubts, medication must carefully consider the balance of deficiency and fullness, phlegm, fire, and their intensity. Only through the unification of internal and external treatments can the illness be resolved swiftly. If one solely relies on sorcery without medicine, the illness cannot be eradicated, and there is no rationale for recovery. Conversely, if one only uses medicine without addressing doubts through sorcery, the healing will be delayed. Hence, a combined approach of internal and external treatment yields rapid effects, which is the foundation of this practice. **Pulse Indicators** A pulse that is occasionally sparse and then rapid, sometimes large and then small, or irregularly hurried or knotted indicates evil pulses. A tense and urgent pulse signifies escaping spirits, while a slippery pulse indicates ghost affliction. **Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment** 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】 **Symptoms of Malevolent Influence** Manifestations of malevolent influence occur due to offending unnatural energies, suddenly causing hands and feet to feel cold, skin to develop bumps, a darkening of the face, disorientation, or nonsensical speech, along with clenched jaws and silenced mouths. Sometimes, there’s dizziness, collapse, and an inability to recognize people. This includes sudden fainting, guest disturbance, spirit flight, ghostly strikes, mourning inquiries, temple visits, or tomb climbing—all indicating such ailments. Administer Suhe Xiang pills, observe as the patient slightly revives, and then give the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder, which is named the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber** **By Chen Shishi, Qing Dynasty** **In case of possession** For urgent treatment, one must not delay even for a moment.

The brilliance of this formula lies in the coarse dried fruit, which can open up the orifices and allows the combined herbs to directly enter the heart, completely dispelling the stagnation caused by phlegm. Once the phlegm is expelled, what remains of the evil? **Formula** **Returning the Soul Decoction** (from Zhang Zhongjing, same below) For sudden death caused by spirit disturbance.

In the year of the Yang wood in the Yuan You period, my mother suffered from such a misfortune, a lingering sorrow to this day. She had a vegetarian diet and was weak in Qi and blood, having grieved over the loss of her son. One day, she experienced Qi counterflow, tightness of the jaw and excessive salivation. A local doctor diagnosed it as a stroke, gave her a strong purge, and she died that evening. I have held this grief ever since. Whenever I encounter such symptoms, I quickly administer Su He Wan and she recovers, after which I adjust treatment according to the heat or cold without fail. Qi disorders arise when Qi does not return to its source, resulting in conditions resembling stroke, leading to faintness and tight jaw, but without phlegm, so one must not mistakenly use wind-dispelling medications or laxatives. First, use ginger juice with warm decoction to adjust Su He Xiang Wan; next, apply Qi-clearing decoction or Da Liu Qi Yin, adding Shi Chang Pu to smooth the Qi for recovery; thereafter, use Zhong Ding Tang with Mu Xiang to harmonize the center and restore Qi to its path.

For copious phlegm and drool, it is advisable to induce vomiting. An urgent remedy is the diluted salve: take four pieces of Soapberry that are plump and unblemished and remove the black skin; one tael of bright alum, finely powdered and mixed.

Lady Qianxian, wife of Gan Huaiquan, first suffered from pain in her chest and abdomen, and the next day she suddenly collapsed, experiencing cold extremities. A physician suggested using a cow bile pill which was ground and ready for consumption. Upon examining her pulse, I found all six main pulses to be weak, with only slight fluctuations in the qi at the mouth of the pulse. This indicated a fullness in her chest, where yin and yang were obstructed, preventing the flow of qi. As a result, the pulse was weak, while the qi was detectable. I took one tael of dried tangerine peel and sand seeds, eight qian of ginger, and three qian of salt, boiled them into a decoction, and after administering it, she expelled five to six bowls of undigested food, and the six pulses were finally observable. The left guan pulse was prominent, and the pain in her chest and abdomen was severe, indicating that excessive anger had caused her condition. I prepared a decoction with muxiang (costus), green citrus peel, tangerine peel, white atractylodes, and cyperus, and administered two doses, which relieved her pain. For further balance, I used the “Four Gentlemen” formula, adding muxiang and wuyao (lindera) and treated her for over ten days until she recovered. This was a case of both food retention and qi stagnation."},{"anchor":"orig-1p","marker":"1p","type":"original","text":"古今图书集成医部全录卷三百二十八 中恶门 千金方 【唐 孙思邈】 飞尸鬼疰
