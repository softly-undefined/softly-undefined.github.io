<p>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen </p>
<p>Zangqi Methodology - Kinds of Discussion</p>
<p>In lung disease, there is wheezing, coughing, and reversed qi, along with shoulder and back pain, and sweating. In kidney disease, there is abdominal swelling, swollen shins, wheezing, coughing, and a heavy body.<br>(Note: The lungs govern the qi of the whole body, while the kidneys are the source of vital essence.)</p>
<p>Discussions on Regulating Menstruation</p>
<p>When qi is excessive, there will be wheezing and cough with ascending qi.<br>(Note: The lungs govern qi and control breathing, hence when excessive, they cause wheezing and cough with upward reversal.)</p>
<p>Yin and Yang Distinction Discussion</p>
<p>When yin struggles within and yang disturbs externally, if the corporeal soul&#39;s sweat is not contained, it rises and causes trouble, which in turn aggravates the lungs and leads to wheezing.<br>(Note: The corporeal soul&#39;s sweat pertains to the lungs. The vital essence returns to the lungs, which connect to the hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin. If the skin sweats while the essence and blood remain stored in yin, then if the corporeal soul&#39;s sweat is not contained, it drains and harms the essence and blood. If the yin fluids of the lungs leak outward, then the yins of the four organs also rise, creating upward disturbance in the lungs, causing rapid wheezing and hoarse voice.)</p>
<p>Diseases of the dual yang affect the heart and spleen, which cannot hide the curves; if women do not have their monthly cycle, it transmits as wind disappearance. If it transmits as hiccup, it leads to death without treatment.<br>(Note: The dual yang refers to the Yangming stomach. The disease arises from dual deficiency in essence and blood, with wind-heat interacting fiercely and fluids increasingly depleted. Fire destroys metal and leads to urgent wheezing and shoulder distress, resulting in death without treatment.)</p>
<p>Discussion on Healthy Person&#39;s Qi Observation</p>
<p>When the neck pulse moves, wheezing and coughing are known as water.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Notes: This observation reveals the condition of the illness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the lungs are unbalanced, there is wheezing and fullness in both sides.<br><strong>Note: The lungs govern respiration, hence the wheezing and fullness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Pulse Reactions</strong></p>
<p>What is called &quot;wheezing above due to water&quot; in the Yangming channel occurs when the Yin energy descends and then rises again. When it rises, the pathogens reside between the organs, resulting in water accumulation.<br><strong>Note: &quot;Yin energy descends and then rises&quot; refers to the winter solstice when Yang is first born, and the Yin energy descends, rising again in May. The Yin energy returns to the water organs, and when the rising Yin energy becomes stronger, water pathogens ascend with the Qi, thereby occupying the organs, leading to wheezing and water retention.</strong> </p>
<p>In the Shaoyin context, &quot;vomiting, coughing, and wheezing&quot; occur because the Yin energy is below and the Yang energy is above; all the Yang energies rise without a foundation to rely on, thus causing vomiting, coughing, and wheezing.<br><strong>Note: The cold water of Shaoyin is below, while the fire energy is above. When water and fire do not interact, the Yang energy rises and floats without support, leading to the upward reversal of Yang heat, which manifests as vomiting, cough, and wheezing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Reversal</strong></p>
<p>With Yangming Qi reversal, there is wheezing and coughing, body heat, anxiety, epistaxis, and vomiting blood.<br><strong>Note: The Qi reversal of Yangming leads to wheezing, and its upward movement causes coughing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Demonstrating Composure</strong></p>
<p>Wheezing and coughing are the result of water Qi combined with Yangming.<br><strong>Note: Wheezing and coughing occur due to the water Qi of the lower jiao combined with the Yangming channel.</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Excess Heat Affecting the Body</strong></p>
<p>Due to heat, one sweats and feels restless, leading to panting and drinking. In calmness, one speaks excessively. The body feels like burning coals, and sweat flows out and dissipates. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the evil heat is intense, it affects the body—heart governs the pulses, hence the heart feels troubled. The lungs are the cover of the heart, so when troubled, one pants and drinks. If not troubled and calm, this evil still resides in the qi division, causing harm to the spirit. When qi is deficient, one speaks excessively. The yang evil of heaven injures one&#39;s yang energy, and these two types of yang clash, causing the body to feel like burning coals. The evil of yang heat releases because of the yin fluids in the body, thus leading to sweating and dispersal.</p>
<p>Excessive sweetness leads to heart qi being full, causing dark coloration and imbalance in kidney qi.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Excessive sweetness solidifies the earth qi; when the earth is solid, the heart qi cannot transmit to the child (descendants), hence the fullness and panting. The kidneys govern water, which is black in color; excessive earth damages the kidneys, resulting in dark coloration and imbalance in kidney qi.</p>
<p><strong>The Large Theory of Yin and Yang Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>When yang prevails, the body feels hot, pores are closed, and panting is coarse. This causes a need to bend or look up; sweating does not occur, yet there is heat, and teeth feel dry. It leads to restlessness, abdominal fullness, and a sense of impending death—able to endure winter, but not summer. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The predominance of yang leads to the stress of fire and heat, thus causing body heat. When heat is on the surface, the pores are closed; when internal, it leads to coarse panting. When yin prevails in the abdomen, one bends down; when yang prevails in the back, one looks up. When yang is dominant throughout the body, sweating does not occur, thus leading to heat. This condition is a sign of the excess of yang heat and thus can prolong life in winter but cannot survive in summer.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, with a color that is not green; when ill, it is likely to be heavy like a battering pulse, due to blood accumulating beneath the ribs, causing the person to wheeze and inhale in distress. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the True Organs</strong></p>
<p>If the autumn pulse is insufficient, it causes wheezing, a weak breath, and coughing; in severe cases, there may be blood in the sputum, and one can hear the sounds of illness. The texts state: When the qi is blocked in the lungs, it causes anxiety; and when it is insufficient, it leads to qi deficiency, causing wheezing and a weak breath. If the qi is deficient and reversely ascends, then blood follows and rises; if the qi retreats downward, one hears the sounds of moans associated with illness. Severe decay in the bones and significant indentation in the flesh, coupled with fullness of qi in the chest, leads to discomfort in breathing; if the qi moves the body, death is expected within six months. When the true organ pulse is observed, it signifies the date of death. The commentary explains that due to yangming qi blockage, the breathing becomes hindered. The movement of qi within the body indicates heart disease that wishes to communicate with the lung. Since the lungs govern qi, excessive qi leads to motion in breathing. The true organ pulse is firm and pounding, resembling the bunched up grains of Job&#39;s tears. The date of death is expected during the midnight of the ren and gui days.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The large bones are dry and withered, the flesh has sunk down, the chest is full of air, breathing is difficult, there is internal pain radiating to the shoulders and neck, and death is expected in one month. </p>
<p>[Note: The internal pain indicates the lungs are affected. The lung&#39;s acupoint is on the shoulder and back, hence the pain radiates to the shoulders and neck. When the pulse is observed, it feels like a blade being struck, or like plucking the strings of a qin. The expected day of death is at dusk on the geng-xin day.]</p>
<p>The large bones are dry and withered, the flesh has sunk down, the chest is full of air, breathing is difficult, there is internal pain radiating to the shoulders and neck, the body is hot, and the flesh is decaying (as in a broken lunar month), the true pulse is visible, and death is expected within ten days. </p>
<p>[Note: The true pulse is large and weak, resembling the skin of a person within a feather. The illness has transferred to the heart, hence the prediction of death within ten days. It can be inferred that the heart is unaffected by the pathogen, thus the speed of death.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Meridians</h3>
<p>When walking at night, breathlessness arises from the kidneys, and indulgent energy harms the lungs.<br>[Note: The kidneys belong to the yin and are associated with storage and concealment. Walking at night causes the kidney energy to leak outward, hence breathlessness arises from the kidneys. The kidneys are the source, and the lungs are the end; the upward rebellion of kidney energy thus harms the lungs.]</p>
<p>When experiencing fear or falling, breathlessness arises from the liver, and indulgent energy damages the spleen.<br>[Note: Falling injures the tendons, which are associated with the liver, hence breathlessness arises from the liver. Wood overcomes earth, thus indulgent energy harms the spleen.]</p>
<p>When startled or frightened, breathlessness arises from the lungs, and indulgent energy injures the heart.<br>[Note: Startlement disrupts the qi, which causes breathlessness to arise from the lungs. The lungs cover the heart, hence indulgent energy injures the heart.]</p>
<p>Falling into water leads to breathlessness from the kidneys and bones.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>【Note: Falling leads to bone injury, and bones correspond to the kidneys, hence the breathlessness.】<br>The Taiyin and Yangming Chapter</p>
<p>Those who are afflicted by the evil of rebellious wind are harmed by yang. When yang is harmed, it enters the six fu organs; when it enters the six fu organs, the body experiences heat and cannot lie down properly, leading to wheezing. 【Note: Yangming qi stagnation causes wheezing above.】<br>The Yangming Pulse Explanation Chapter</p>
<p>When yangming is stagnant, it results in wheezing and lamentation; lamentation denotes aversion to others. 【Note: The heat of yangming rises against shaoyin, causing the balance of yin and yang to falter, leading to fear and aversion to others.】 Stagnation and reversal can lead to death if it involves the organs but can lead to life if it involves the meridians.<br>【Note: For example, if the heat evil stagnates upwards, disrupting the channels related to the heart and lungs, it causes wheezing and lamentation; disrupting the heart and lung organs leads to death.】<br>The Reversal Regulation Theory</p>
<p>Not being able to lie down but wheezing indicates the presence of water qi. Water flows along the channels of fluids; the kidneys are the water organ, governing the fluids, lying down, and wheezing. 【Note: Water fluids from the stomach flow down through the guan to the kidneys, which is a correct pathway. If yangming is obstructed and cannot descend properly to the kidneys, then the water qi of the kidneys flows back along the pathway of the fluids upwards towards the stomach, resulting in disharmony in the stomach and unrest in lying down. Hence it is said: the kidneys are the water organ, governing the storage of fluids and also governing lying down and wheezing.】<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pain</strong></p>
<p>Labour leads to panting and sweating; both internally and externally, there is excess, thus the vital energy is depleted.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Lung obstruction manifests as restlessness, panting, and vomiting. </p>
<p>Heart obstruction results in obstructed pulses, restlessness leads to a distended sensation below the heart, and sudden gasping occurs. The heart governs the pulse; hence obstruction causes the pulse to be unresponsive. The pathogens disturb the area below the heart, affecting the heart itself, resulting in restlessness and the distended sensation below the heart. The lungs cover the heart, and as the heart&#39;s pulse extends to the lungs, reversed energy surges upward, causing panting.</p>
<p>Intestinal obstruction involves frequent drinking without relief, internal energy contends, and occasional diarrhea occurs. </p>
<p>Intestinal obstruction refers to both the small and large intestines. The small intestine, being a subordinate of the heart, governs urination; obstruction affecting the small intestine leads to heat accumulation above causing frequent drinking, while below it results in retention of urination. The large intestine, a subordinate of the lungs, governs defecation; obstruction affecting the large intestine results in internal energy contention above, while below it leads to diarrhea.</p>
<p>Excessive energy produces panting, indicating obstruction in the lungs.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>If the quality of dampness accumulates and leads to wheezing, then the lung qi does not store properly, resulting in blockage in the lungs.</p>
<p>To puncture at the cavity of the chest allows the internal qi to escape, causing the person to wheeze and cough. The key to puncturing is that the qi arrives, producing an effect. If the pulse is sunken and the qi instead flows downward, it leads to counterproductive symptoms like coughing and wheezing. The classic states: when qi rises to the chest, one cannot stand for long due to wheezing; the illness pertains to the large intestine, as the large intestine is the organ coupled with the lungs. Puncturing in the center of the chest, thus, targets the lung in cases of wheezing and counterflow of breath.</p>
<p>The foot yangming channel meets in the center of the chest, and the lung channel also travels through the chest to the points Yunmen and Zhongfu. If the pulse at the center of the chest is sunken and penetrates deeply, affecting the pulse of the lung, it causes wheezing and counterflow of breath, likely due to unintentional injury.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Water and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Water diseases manifest as abdominal distension and edema below, and as shortness of breath and inability to lie down above; both the root and the branches of the disease are affected. Hence, the lungs are responsible for the shortness of breath, and the kidneys for the edema, while the lungs are in distress, causing the inability to lie down.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Transformation of Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the fire of the year is too excessive, the heat of summer circulates, affecting the lungs and causing the people to suffer from malaria, with symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. In years when metal (the lungs) is overly excessive, dry qi circulates, leading to shortness of breath and reversed qi in severe cases. When the cold qi of the year is excessive, it harms the heart&#39;s fire, resulting in severe coughs and shortness of breath. If water becomes too excessive and causes harm, it results in the rebellious rise of water qi and consequent coughing and shortness of breath.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>In the Lesser Yin season, the influence of heat overwhelms, causing the populace to suffer from discomfort in the chest, dry throat, fullness on the right side, skin pain, and chills with heat, leading to severe symptoms such as abdominal distension and wheezing. </p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yin governs the sky, marking the peak time of the year. All symptoms are related to lung metal, indicating that excessive heat injures the metal energy.)</p>
<p>In the same Lesser Yin period, heat&#39;s influence leads to ongoing abdominal rumbling, with energy ascending to the chest, causing difficulty in standing due to breathlessness. </p>
<p>(Note: Difficulty in standing due to breathlessness indicates heat overwhelming the lung metal.)</p>
<p>When the Lesser Yin oversees the sky, when the influence becomes severe, it results in swelling and bleeding, ulcers, and coughing with wheezing. </p>
<p>(Note: The triad of energy is governed by the fire of Lesser Yin, and coughing with wheezing signifies the overpowering of this energy.)</p>
<p>In the Greater Yin, when influences prevail, swelling appears on the head and face, leading to shortness of breath and wheezing. </p>
<p>(Note: Swelling in the head and face indicates excessive dampness above, while wheezing indicates dampness affecting the interior.)</p>
<p>In the Yangming period, when the influences are strong, chilling obstruction occurs in the intestines, affecting the chest, leading to breathlessness and inability to stand for long. </p>
<p>(Note: Chilling obstruction in the intestines rises and affects the lungs; severe breathlessness occurs when cold energy rises counter to the Yangming large intestine, impacting the lungs.)</p>

<p><strong>The Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Five Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Pure Qi resides in the Yin, while turbid Qi exists in the Yang; nourishing Qi flows smoothly through the channels, while defensive Qi moves in reverse. The interaction of pure and turbid causes disorder in the chest, which is called great disorder; when disordered in the lungs, there is difficulty in exhalation and inhalation, necessitating hand support for breathing.<br><em>[Note: The interaction of pure and turbid refers to the nourishing and defensive Qi corresponding to the Yin and Yang pathways. Hence, disorder in the chest and lungs results in conditions of great disorder, causing difficulty in breathing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The hand Taiyin meridian of the lungs, when in motion, causes lung distension, leading to fullness and wheezing cough.<br><em>[Note: When in motion, this results in lung distension, fullness, and wheezing cough, caused by the Qi of the arms reversing.]</em> The foot Shaoyin meridian of the kidneys, when in motion, causes a dryand wheezing cough, leading to a desire to rise while sitting.<br><em>[Note: Above the Shaoyin, the lordly fire is in control. When movement in the Shaoyin leads to symptoms of coughing and wheezing, it is because the vital Qi of the Shaoyin does not ascend to connect with the lungs, causing the lung Qi to rise inversely.]</em><a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on Fevers</strong></p>

Panting accompanied by recurrent heat suggests the evil has entered the interior, hence do not puncture the skin. Severe panting indicates strong evil within causing harm to yin, leading to death.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Distention</strong></p>

<p>A small lung leads to little drinking and does not cause panting or coughing; a large lung leads to excessive drinking and is prone to chest obstruction, throat obstruction, and adverse qi. A high lung indicates upward qi causing shoulder panting and coughing; a low lung suggests pressure on the lungs, resulting in pain beneath the ribs. A firm lung does not suffer from cough or panting, while a fragile lung is prone to huǐ (consumptive conditions) and injury. A properly aligned lung tends to be harmonious and resilient, while a tilted lung leads to localized chest pain.<br>[Note: The lungs reside in the chest, opening to the throat to regulate breathing. Thus, smaller lungs do not result in panting or coughing, while larger lungs can cause chest and throat obstructions. The lungs govern qi, so high lungs lead to upward qi disturbance, causing shoulder panting and coughing.]<br><strong>Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han - Zhang Ji)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Diagnosis and Treatment of Respiratory Illness</h3>
<p>The chapter on Damp diseases states: When afflicted by dampness, the body aches and has fever, the face becomes sallow and wheezing occurs, accompanied by headaches, nasal congestion, and restlessness. The pulse is large, yet the person can still eat and the abdomen feels comfortable. The ailment lies in cold dampness in the head, hence the nasal blockage. Administering internal medicine into the nose would alleviate this.</p>
<p>The chapter on Blood Stasis states: In men with a pale complexion, this indicates thirst and loss of blood, along with sudden palpitations; a floating pulse indicates internal deficiency. When the pulse is deep, weak, and slow, it is termed &quot;dispersed qi&quot;; such individuals experience shortness of breath while moving quickly, cold in the hands and feet, abdominal fullness, and in severe cases, diarrhea and undigested food.</p>
<p>The chapter on Lung Abscess and Lung Atrophy states: When asking about a cough that reverses, how can one determine it is a lung abscess? There should be purulent blood; expectorating it would signify death. What kind of pulse is it? The teacher said: The pulse at the inch is weak and rapid, weak indicates wind, rapid indicates heat; weak leads to sweating, rapid leads to aversion to cold. Wind affects the protective qi, causing breath to be obstructed; heat attacks the nourishing qi, causing inhalation to fail. Wind harms the skin and hair, heat damages the blood vessels. Wind resides in the lungs, causing cough, dry mouth, wheezing, fullness in the chest, dry throat without thirst, and excessive thick phlegm with occasional shivering. Where heat has passed, blood stagnates, leading to abscesses and pus, expectorating like rice porridge. It can be saved in its early stage; if pus has formed, it leads to death.</p>
<p>For upper respiratory issues with facial swelling and shoulder breathing, a floating and large pulse indicates it is untreatable; if combined with diarrhea, it is even worse.</p>
<p>For wheezing and restlessness, it pertains to lung distention, which can improve with sweating.</p>
<p>For severe upward qi obstruction with pharyngeal discomfort, stopping the reverse qi requires the prescription of Mai Men Dong Decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Lung abscess, inability to lie down due to wheezing, the formula &quot;Ting Li Da Zao Xie Fei Tang&quot; is indicated for it. </p>

<p>Cough with wheezing, indicating lung distension; if the person has wheezing, bulging eyes, and a floating, large pulse, the formula &quot;Yue Bi Jia Ban Xia Tang&quot; is indicated for it. </p>
<p>Cough and counterflow wheezing, often producing turbid saliva, unable to sit or sleep, the formula &quot;Zao Jia Wan&quot; is indicated for it. </p>
<p>For lung distension, with wheezing, agitation, floating pulse, and water under the heart, the formula &quot;Xiao Qing Long Jia Shi Gao Tang&quot; is indicated for it. </p>
<p>Lung abscess, fullness and swelling in the chest, entire body and face swollen, nasal blockage with clear discharge, inability to smell aromas or pungent scents, cough with counterflow wheezing, and wheezing that feels tight and obstructed, the formula &quot;Ting Li Da Zao Xie Fei Tang&quot; is indicated for it. </p>
<p>The chapter on chest obstruction says: &quot;The disease of chest obstruction includes wheezing, cough with sputum, pain in the chest and back, shortness of breath, the pulse at the wrist is deep and slow, while at the Guan pulse is tight and rapid; the formula &#39;Lu Xiao Bai Jiu Tang&#39; is indicated for it.&quot; </p>
<p>The chapter on wind and cold in the five organs states: &quot;Wind in the lungs results in dry mouth and wheezing, heaviness and swelling of the body.&quot; </p>
<p>The chapter on phlegm and fluid states: &quot;If phlegm is present above the diaphragm, there will be fullness, cough, and sputum expulsion, accompanied by chills and fever, back pain, aches in the waist, and tears from the eyes; the person may tremble and shake violently, indicating hidden fluids.&quot; </p>
<p>For patients who drink a lot of water, they will definitely suffer from wheezing fullness. In general, less food and more drink leads to water retention below the heart; in severe cases, this results in palpitations, while milder cases lead to shortness of breath. A double-string pulse indicates coldness, and they feel weak after major purging; a偏string pulse indicates fluids. </p>
<p>Lung fluids that are not string-like manifest as bitter wheezing and shortness of breath.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>When there is accumulation of fluid in the chest, one experiences shortness of breath and cannot lie down, accompanied by a weak pulse. If there is fluid accumulation between the diaphragm and the chest, the person breathes heavily, has a feeling of fullness under the heart, a firm and hard abdomen, and a dark complexion with a deep and tight pulse. If this condition persists for several days and treatment with vomiting or purging does not work, the prescription of Mufangji Decoction should be used. The weak will recover, but the strong may relaps for three days. If not cured, it is advisable to use Mufangji Decoction without gypsum and add Fuling Mangxia Decoction. </p>
<p>The Water Pathologies section states: In case of genuine water condition, the pulse is deep and slow, and the external signs are shortness of breath. </p>
<p>In cases of Taiyang disease, the treatment should focus on joint pain. If there is pain in the joints, along with cough and shortness of breath without thirst, this indicates spleen distension, appearing swollen, which will resolve with sweating. However, in all other diseases with thirst, diarrhea, and frequent urination, one should not induce sweating.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The Yellow Jaundice chapter states: When suffering from jaundice, with symptoms of fever, irritability, wheezing, fullness in the chest, and dryness in the mouth, it is due to the illness arising when fire consumes the sweat, leading to dual heat conditions.

<p>In jaundice, if the urine color does not change and there is a desire for relief, accompanied by abdominal fullness and wheezing, one cannot remove the heat; if the heat is removed, it will lead to hiccups. Hiccups are treated with Xiaoshanxia Decoction.</p>
<p>The Vomiting chapter states: If a patient feels a sensation of wheezing without actually wheezing, feels nausea without vomiting, or experiences hiccups without true hiccups, feeling lost and confused in the heart, they should take a decoction of ginger and Banxia.</p>
<p>For diarrhea, if the hands and feet are cold and there is no pulse, moxibustion will not warm them; if the pulse does not return and the patient is slightly wheezing, it indicates death. The condition of lesser yin oppressing greater yang is deemed proper.</p>

<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: all qi belongs to the lungs, and all wheezing also pertains to the lungs. Thus, a person&#39;s inhalation and exhalation is called breath. Between the breathing, the spleen receives this qi, circulating through the nourishing and protective energies, harmonizing yin and yang, flowing throughout the body, achieving balance. If one loses proper regulation, affected by the six excesses or the seven emotions, or due to falls, shocks, or overeating, or through exertion, it results in disharmony of internal qi, compromising the regularity of nourishing and protective energies, preventing the inhalation and exhalation that form breath, leading to pressure in the lungs, causing wheezing. Diagnosing a sliding pulse with warm extremities signifies life; a thin pulse with cold extremities indicates death, and a rapid pulse also signifies death, as it indicates a loss of form. Furthermore, there is also postpartum wheezing, which is particularly urgent, due to excessive bleeding after childbirth, leaving the nourishing blood violently depleted and the protective qi lacking control, aggregating solely in the lungs, thus causing urgent wheezing, referred to as isolated yang and extinguished yin, which is difficult to treat. The medical approach should address the causes, carefully discerning the deficiency, fullness, heat, and cold to treat accordingly. As for postpartum wheezing, it has already been documented in obstetrics, so it will not be elaborated upon again. Additionally, there can be phlegm stagnating in the gastric region, where phlegm clashes with qi, blocking the lung pathways, which also causes upper qi difficulties; this too must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Wheezing is caused by excessive heat in summer and deficiency due to winter cold. Hence, when suffering from cold, the qi is weak and the breath is shallow; when suffering from heat, the qi is strong and the breath is coarse. Cold water represents yin, which is associated with slowness; hot fire represents yang, which is associated with rapidity. Therefore, in cold conditions, the breath is slow and shallow, while in hot conditions, the breath is rapid, coarse, and results in wheezing.</p>
<p><strong>On Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>This should be understood according to classic texts: when the evil qi is excessive, it leads to fullness. Hua Tuo mentioned: when excessive, it causes wheezing; when diminished, it leads to dryness. Thus, the &quot;Living Person&quot; also states: those who wheeze have excess qi. When interpreting texts, one must grasp the underlying meaning. The idea that fullness leads to wheezing does not refer to excessive lung qi; wheezing due to excess lung qi also does not imply that the qi is actually surplus. Excess should be regarded as deficiency, and surplus should be interpreted as insufficient. If lung qi were truly excessive, and if there were surplus, it would naturally descend without causing wheezing, because fire would enter the lungs, leading to deficiency and insufficiency that result in wheezing. Therefore, stating fullness does not mean that lung qi is full; it means that the fire in the lungs is excessive. Saying there is surplus does not mean that lung qi is abundant; it refers to the excess fire in the lungs. Thus, using bitter cold remedies to purge the lungs does not actually purge the lungs, but rather purges the fire within the lungs, while genuinely nourishing lung qi. When in a calm state, the qi is harmonious; when in action, the qi causes wheezing, which pertains to the fire of the Chong meridian. The Kidney Nourishing Pill addresses this.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Asthma</strong></p>
<p>Asthma involves deficiency of qi, yin deficiency, and phlegm accumulation. </p>
<p>For prolonged asthma symptoms, when not yet manifested, the focus should be on supporting the righteous qi. If already manifested, the emphasis should be on expelling pathogens. When qi is deficient, leading to shortness of breath and wheezing, bitter and cold medicines should not be used because the heat is excessive; it is advisable to use Guo Tang with Qian Yin Tang. If phlegm is present, it can also lead to shortness of breath and wheezing. For those with yin deficiency, where heat from the lower abdomen rises and causes wheezing, one should suppress heart fire and replenish yin. For those with phlegm heat, it is necessary to clear lung heat and expel phlegm. </p>
<p>For shortness of breath and agitation, this indicates lung distension, which may lead to water retention; in such cases, inducing sweating can provide relief. If there is urgent wheezing with phlegm rising, the recipe from &quot;Da Quan&quot; with Qian Yin Tang is optimal, or Guo Tang combined with Qian Yin Tang can be used. For those with yin deficiency accompanied by phlegm and wheezing, use Si Wu Tang with Zhi Ke and Ban Xia to nourish yin and reduce fire. </p>
<p>For persistent wheezing, using a few doses of Jiao Yao can be effective. After addressing the condition, treat phlegm with phlegm remedies and fire with fire remedies. The Jiao Yao can consist of finely ground Jiao Mu mixed with a small amount of ginger decoction. Those with qi deficiency should not use this. </p>
<p>Another method: steam radish seeds as the main ingredient, using evenly burned Zao Jiao ash as powder, and making pill-sized rounds with ginger juice and honey. Taking five to seventy of these pills can help relieve the condition. </p>
<p>For those with qi deficiency, use ingredients like Ren Shen, honey-fried Huang Lian, Mai Men Dong, and Di Guo. </p>
<p>If asthma occurs due to excessive consumption of Huang Qi, use San Yao Tang to drain qi. </p>
<p>If the person is wheezing, they should use Ejiao.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>If one suffers from a long illness, with deficiency of qi leading to wheezing, one should supplement with Ejiao, ginseng, and schisandra. If it is a recent illness with excess qi causing wheezing, one should use mulberry bark and bitter herb to purge it. </p>
<p>The lungs rely on the clear yang energy that rises, residing above the five organs, connecting to the defensive and nutritive qi, harmonizing yin and yang, allowing for ascending and descending movements. Any excess or deficiency can lead to problems. Influences from external pathogens or emotional disturbances, overeating, physical activity, or disharmony in organ qi all interfere with breathing, resulting in wheezing. Those with weakness in both spleen and kidney can also experience wheezing. Additionally, improper management might lead to effects from wind, cold, heat, or dampness, causing the lung qi to swell and result in wheezing. Phlegm and qi can also lead to wheezing. </p>
<p>The treatment method must address the root cause; if affected by external pathogens, one should disperse them; if qi is stagnant, it must be regulated; for weakness in spleen and kidney, warming and regulating treatments are necessary. Furthermore, one should consider each type specifically. As a general guideline, if the pulse is slippery and the hands and feet are warm, the prognosis is good; if the pulse is thin and the limbs are cold, it indicates a grave condition. </p>
<p>For those affected by wind and cold, they will certainly experience urgent breathing, unable to lie down, with sounds in the throat, which may be suppressed. One may choose from San Ao Decoction, Huagai Powder, Jiubao Decoction, or Shenmi Decoction. </p>
<p>If dealing with phlegm-related wheezing, use Simora Decoction or Suzi Jiangqi Decoction.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>If there is shortness of breath, a weak pulse, a blue-black complexion, cold limbs, and frequent urination, use the Schisandra decoction from the &quot;Book of Reviving Lives,&quot; or the Four Molar Decoction. For treating both cough and wheezing, use more Schisandra. However, Schisandra comes in northern and southern varieties: for generating fluids, quenching thirst, moisturizing the lungs, and treating consumptive cough, the northern Schisandra is recommended; for wind evil in the lungs, the southern Schisandra is advisable.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Asthma</h3>
<p>Asthma must be treated with light, flavorful remedies that focus on phlegm, and it is advisable to induce a great expulsion. Medicinal ingredients should mainly include sweet flavors, avoiding cool ingredients. The medicine must often exude an exterior-dispelling quality, as this represents warmth encased in cold. There are also cases of deficiency where expulsion is not possible. One method is to use Er Chen Decoction with the addition of Atractylodes and Scutellaria to create a decoction, then administer it through Xiao Wei Dan. Treatment should be based on the evaluation of deficiency and excess.</p>
<h3>Important Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>Asthma manifests as a wheezing illness, with sounds reminiscent of a water chicken, pulling at the chest and back, causing difficulty in breathing, and restlessness in sitting or lying down. This is referred to as a cough with wheezing. If there is a long-standing root of the issue, exposure to cold can trigger it; sudden onset can also occur. In such cases, adding Mulberry Bark to cough medicine may help. Meanwhile, it’s good to take Yang Zheng Dan intermittently along with Qing Jin Dan. For wind-cold type wheezing, Jiu Bao Decoction is recommended. If there is wheezing without cough, regardless of duration, then Su Zi Jiang Qi Decoction or Shen Mi Decoction with Yang Zheng Dan should be used. In severe cases, Si Mo Drink or Liu Mo Drink with Ling Sha Dan, or Qing Meng Guan Yin Powder, and Yang Zheng Dan are particularly suitable. If asthma shows no effect from medication, draining and guiding might be necessary, ideally using Shen Bao Wan. If the stools are already loose, do not take these medicines.</p>
<p>For cases with no cough but with sudden breathlessness, there are two categories that need differentiation. If there is external evil forcing on the lungs causing breathlessness, the initial stage will present with immediate breath troubles, invariably accompanied by external signs; this is termed asthma. If depleting remedies are administered to eliminate the evil, the original qi will further diminish, leading to a more pronounced upward rush of breath; thus, one should seek remedies for breathlessness with phlegm. If there is pain between the diaphragm due to breathlessness, a differentiated drink for qi should be used.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Asthma Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In treating asthma, if there is no phlegm at the onset but phlegm is expectorated when recovery is approaching, it indicates that phlegm is blocked and inaccessible at the onset, causing severe asthma. At that time, one should open the phlegm pathways to ease the condition. Suitable treatments include single combinations like Platycodon root, Zhi Ke (bitter orange), Luo Shi Teng (trichosanthes fruit), apricot kernels, Perilla leaves, and Xuan Fu Hua (inula flower) to help expel phlegm. Once phlegm is out and asthma subsides, the treatment should adjust according to the condition of deficiency and excess. For deficiency, one can tonify with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. For excess, one should eliminate phlegm with formulas like the fragrant sinking round.</p>
<p>When asthma is triggered by cold, there are two diagnoses: the first involves both internal and external cold. The treatment includes Dongyuan’s Ginseng and Perilla Warm Lung Decoction, regulating the middle and augmenting the qi with added black currant decoction and Zijing Pill, for those who are affected by cold phlegm.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The second type is cold enclosing heat; the treatment methods are based on what Zhongjing and Danxi used, such as the formula with Yuè Bì and Banxià. In late summer or early autumn, before it gets cold, first use the Da Chenqi Decoction to expel the heat. By winter, when it is cold, there should be no heat to enclose, and thus it will not manifest. </p>
<p>In daily life, if the qi is harmonious, but upon movement it becomes rapid and leads to wheezing, this is also the fire of the Chong vessel. My cousin, who is over sixty, has a history of wheezing and occasionally spits out blood-streaked phlegm. When at rest, he does not wheeze, but upon slight exertion, he experiences rapid breathing. Taking Huangbai Zhi Mu Zi Ren Wan, about seventy or eighty pills on an empty stomach, has greatly reduced his symptoms. This is how Huangbai and Zhi Mu can drain the fire of the Chong vessel, producing such effects.</p>
<p>In cases of wheezing where lying down is difficult, if the pulse is floating and, upon pressure, feels weak and thin, this indicates yin deficiency, with imminent danger—do not administer purgatives, as that would be fatal. It is advisable to use Si Wu Tang with Tong Bian (child’s urine), Zhuli (bamboo juice), Qingdai, Mendan, Wuweizi, Zhike, and Suye.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma and Distention</strong> </p>
<p>Asthma and distention share the same symptoms, both must involve difficulty in urination. Asthma must lead to distention, while distention must lead to asthma; however, one must recognize the primary and secondary conditions. When asthma occurs before distention, it is centered in the lungs; when distention occurs before asthma, it is centered in the spleen. Why is this? The lungs govern descent and, externally, control the skin and hair. The Classic states: &quot;The lungs connect with the hundred vessels, regulating the pathways of water and draining to the bladder.&quot; It also states: &quot;The bladder is the official of the metropolis, where fluids are stored; when Qi transforms, they can be released.&quot; Thus, the passage of urine is dependent on the descending Qi of the lungs for transformation and distribution. If the lungs are affected by evils and one experiences asthma, they lose the command for descent, leading to a gradual reduction in urination, causing water to overflow into the skin and result in distention. Here, asthma is primary and distention is secondary; the treatment should focus on clearing metal and lowering fire as a main approach and then promoting water as a secondary measure.</p>
<p>The spleen, associated with earth, is adverse to dampness and externally governs the muscles. Earth can control water, but if the spleen is damaged and cannot restrain water, then excess moisture runs amok, saturating the muscles. When water overflows, it inversely invades the lungs, preventing Qi from descending and causing asthma. Here, distention is primary and asthma is secondary; the treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen and promoting water as a main approach, and then clearing metal as a secondary measure. </p>
<p>If one uses drying medications for lung conditions, the metal becomes dry and asthma worsens; if one uses clearing metal medications for spleen conditions, the spleen becomes cold and distention worsens. In recent times, treatments for these two conditions focus solely on strengthening the spleen and promoting water, without distinguishing between spleen and lung conditions, hence I write to clarify this.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>If there is lurking heat in the lungs that cannot generate fluid, leading to coughing and thirst, Huangqin Qingfei Decoction should be used to clear the lungs, alongside Wuling Powder to cleanse the small intestine. If there is weakness in the spleen and lungs that hampers the regulation of fluids, then Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be used to strengthen the original qi, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to replenish kidney water. If one consumes rich and heavy foods, resulting in excess heat in the spleen and lungs leading to coughing, Qingwei Powder should be used to treat the stomach, and Zhi Shen Wan to promote urination. If heart fire attacks lung metal preventing kidney water generation, then Ren Shen Ping Fei San should be used for the lungs, and Zi Yin Wan to nourish urination. If there is depletion of kidney yin and false fire damaging lung metal preventing urination, then Liu Wei Di Huang Wan should be used to replenish kidney water, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish spleen earth. If there is weakness of spleen qi that cannot control and results in coughing, then Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be used to raise the original qi, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to generate kidney water. If liver wood overcomes spleen earth, leading to uncontrolled coughing, then Liu Jun, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma should be used to nourish the original qi, along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to replenish kidney water. If there is cold deficiency in spleen and stomach leading to distension, then Ba Wei Wan should be used to strengthen spleen and lungs producing kidney water. If spleen and lung cold deficiency cannot regulate fluid pathways causing distension, then Jin Gui may be modified to strengthen spleen and lungs to produce kidney water. If excessive drinking damages the three yin leading to coughing, distension, phlegm accumulation, with irregular bowel movements causing pain, then the aforementioned pill should also be prescribed, as many benefit from it.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine [Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Wheezing is defined as rapid breathing, while a sound in the throat is referred to as wheeze. In cases of deficiency, the patient experiences weak energy and a cool body, with cold phlegm like ice; in cases of excess, there is strong energy and a full chest, with a hot body and constipation. </p>
<p>For fire conditions, the Classics state: &quot;All rebellious surges belong to fire.&quot; In deficiency fire, it is advisable to nourish and descend the qi; in excess fire, it is necessary to clear the lungs and drain the stomach. When fire inflames the lungs and stomach, breathing may alternate between improvement and worsening, easing with food but worsening with thick phlegm. Once food enters the stomach, it can exacerbate fire and phlegm, leading to significant wheezing; thus, it is useful to reduce fire, clear metal, and guide phlegm using decoctions with herbs such as Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, Apricot kernels, and Trichosanthes. If there is excess fire in the stomach with thick phlegm in the diaphragm, Water Guiding Pills should be used. </p>
<p>Phlegm wheezing is always accompanied by a phlegm sound. For wind phlegm, use Qianqian Decoction or combine with Phlegm Guiding Decoction. For phlegm and qi, use Suzi Decoction to descend qi or Si Mo Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>For food accumulation and phlegm, it is advisable to use Ermu San, Shenbao Wan, and Da Luozhao Wan. For shock and worry causing Qi stagnation, with a bubbling sensation in the throat, nasal congestion and wheezing, and shortness of breath without phlegm sounds, use Siqi Decoction, Zhiju Decoction, Fenqi Zisu Drink, and Simotan. If suffering from wheezing after taking supplements, use San&#39;ao Decoction. </p>
<p>For external pathogen invasion affecting the interior, if the interior is not affected and Qi reverses upwards, refer to the section on wheezing in cold damage. For general cold, with wind and cold affecting the lungs causing upset and wheezing, treat by dispelling wind according to the season using Jinfei Cao San or Mahuang Xingren Drink. For wind-induced wheezing, adjust San&#39;ao Decoction, add Huoxiang Zhengqi San with Schisandra and apricot kernels, or use Su Chen Jiubao Drink. In hot months, use Xiangge Decoction. For heat syndrome, use Xiaochaihu Decoction or Liange San. </p>
<p>For water-induced wheezing, characterized by a rolling sensation of water and audible anxiety, use Xiao Qinglong Decoction, Gu Tingzao San, or Baiqian Decoction.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Edema causes water to swell the lungs and lead to shortness of breath. However, shortness of breath will inevitably lead to swelling, and swelling will in turn cause shortness of breath; these two symptoms are interdependent and both result from poor urination. The lungs govern qi, so when shortness of breath occurs first followed by swelling, one should clear the metal element and reduce fire, and then move water. The spleen governs dampness; therefore, when swelling occurs first followed by shortness of breath, one should dry the spleen, move water, and then clear the metal element.</p>
<p>In cases of shortness of breath due to yin deficiency, if there is blood deficiency, yang will have no support and rise uncontrollably; one should use Si Wu Tang with increased quantities of white peony, plus ginseng and schizandra to settle it. If there is fire rising from the lower abdomen causing shortness of breath, one should reduce heart fire and nourish the true yin, using a combination of two herbs and Er Chen Tang plus honeysuckle, forsythia, zhi ke, and huang Qin.</p>
<p>For chronic illness where the person has shortness of breath that seems not to cease, one can use only ginseng decoction, Fu Pi Sheng Mai San, or Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Tang. For those exhausted from overexertion, use Xing Ren San. For heat-related dietary issues, use Ting Li San.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>For phlegm obstructing shortness of breath, use Phlegm-Dissolving Decoction. When turbid yin is above and clear yang is sinking, leading to cough, wheezing, and vomiting, add modified Xiebai Powder. If there is deficiency and cold in the lower source, where the kidney qi cannot return to its source, use Jiuwei Anshen Pill or Bawei Pill; in severe cases, use Heixi Dan to stabilize. If there is agitation with no pulse, body cold, and spirit foggy, it results in death.</p>
<p>Extreme stomach deficiency causes qi to rebel upwards, leading to elevation of shoulders and distention of the abdomen; treat with Shengmai Powder plus apricot kernel, tangerine peel, and white atractylodes, or use Li Zhong Wan with pepper for rescue. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states: Sweating like oil, perspiration emerging like beads but not flowing, shoulders raised, abdomen distended, wheezing without end, with prominent chest and scattered pulse, cold in hands and feet, and a scattered or rapid pulse indicate certain death. However, for women with wheezing, particularly after childbirth with depleted vitality and no protective qi, concentrated in the lungs leading to wheezing, the death is swift. </p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Blood deficiency should be replenished with blood, and qi deficiency should be replenished with qi, while also clearing the metal and lowering fire, harmonizing qi to transform phlegm. Coughing is not merely due to wind-cold invading the lungs; rather, phlegm and fire are making the lungs swell. Wind-cold should be expelled, and phlegm-fire should be guided out. However, if the fire is urgent, one should not rely solely on bitter herbs and should warm it to counteract. Use five to seven qian of powdered black pepper, taken with ginger soup. Once the cough stops, treat phlegm with phlegm and fire with fire. For persistent coughing, consider Xiao Luo Zao pills, Ding Xi biscuits, Han Qi pills, or Ding Chuan Hua Tan powder. For chronic cases, use Ren Shen Qing Fei drink with double the amount of glume.</p>
<p>For coughs caused by cold damage and shortness of breath, there are only the Taiyang and Yangming syndromes: the Taiyang syndrome presents without sweating but with coughing, and should be treated with sweating; the Yangming syndrome shows profuse sweating and coughing, and should be treated with purging. If Taiyang and Yangming syndromes combine, presenting with chest fullness and cough accompanied by aversion to cold, only sweating should be used, not purging. Therefore, it is said that slight coughing indicates that the exterior has not yet resolved. If coughing with fullness is not accompanied by aversion to cold, purging will cure it. There are also cases of coughing after sweating when water is retained, or after purging leading to coughing, or cases of severe cough due to yin deficiency—these require Fan Yin Pill. If the pulse is hidden, add the modified Sheng Mai powder. If the pulse is hidden with sweating and spontaneous moisture, the lung cannot be cured.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Medical Canon Must Read</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi】</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Asthma</strong></p>
<p>Asthma is characterized by quick, labored breathing, loud phlegm sounds, opening of the mouth and elevation of the shoulders, and a shaking of the body and abdomen. Shortness of breath occurs when the breathing is rapid but lacks continuity; it resembles asthma but without phlegm sounds, and the shoulders are not raised, indicating that the lungs are obstructed but not descending. Wheezing is similar to asthma but does not have the same volume of airflow; instead, it produces sounds like &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;xia.&quot; The &quot;xia&quot; sound occurs with an open mouth while the &quot;ya&quot; sound happens with a closed mouth. Both sounds result in the combined character for wheezing, indicating phlegm stuck in the throat connected to the breath, which is why these sounds emerge. The three symptoms must be clearly distinguished. According to the <em>Inner Canon</em>, asthma has many causes, but fundamentally it involves upward counterflow of fire, preventing the qi from descending. There are also several causes related to deficiency; whether it arises from familial entanglements or from enemies causing harm, impacting the lung&#39;s metal qi and preventing the heavenly way from providing nourishment and clarity, all can be attributed to the blame of fire. However, while fire is singular, deficiency and excess are distinct. Danxi said: Deficient fire can be supplemented, using items like ginseng and astragalus; excess fire can be drained, using herbs like coptis and scutellaria.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Whenever I encounter worldly issues and those who suffer from wheezing, a pure condition disrupts the qi. To those who are excessive in their condition, it is rightly so, but what about those who are deficient? I have discussed this and found that nineteen died from deficiency and eleven from excess. To treat excess effectively attacks the root, presenting no difficulty. However, to treat deficiency, supplementation may not yield immediate results; it requires a long-term approach, and the process of adjusting and progressing is not easy. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish symptoms quickly, especially wheezing symptoms. The Chao and Yan families only speak of excess fire, yet Wang Haizang claims: if lung qi is truly vigorous, it should clear and descend, how could it cause wheezing? All argue that fire consumes the true qi, leading to weakness and wheezing. What is referred to as vigorous is not lung qi but the fire within the lungs. This statement surpasses ancient wisdom; regrettably, it only touches the surface and lacks thorough explanation, so let us elaborate.</p>
<p>When qi is deficient and fire enters the lungs, one must first supplement qi, using formulas like Six Gentlemen Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If fire rides on the gold element, it is vital to strengthen water, using methods like Shen Wei Di Huang Wan. For wind-cold, expel the evil with San Ao Decoction or Hua Gai Powder. For dampness, facilitate the water with Shen Shi Decoction. For summer heat, clear the vexation with Bai Hu Decoction or Xiang Ru Decoction. For lung heat, clear the upper parts with Er Dong, Er Mu, Gan, Jiao, Zhi, and Qin. For phlegm obstruction, resolve it with Er Chen Decoction. For qi stagnation, disperse it with Si Qi Decoction. For stagnation of fluids, induce vomiting, but if vomiting does not cure, employ Mu Fang Ji Decoction.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Fire is indeed the element of clarity. Baihu Decoction, supplemented with Trichosanthes fruit, bitterorange peel, and Scutellaria, is effective. For lung abscesses causing wheezing, protect the gold and transform toxins with Coix seed, licorice root, Platycodon root, fritillaria, magnolia flower, honeysuckle, tangerine peel, and asparagine. For lung distension with wheezing, promote water and disperse pathogens. Symptoms of lung distension include coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, restlessness, eyes like bulging, and a floating pulse. In such cases, use the modified Guo Bi Decoction with Pinellia. If the pulse is floating and there&#39;s water under the heart, the Xiao Qing Long Decoction plus gypsum should be administered. For kidney deficiency with fire not returning to its pathway, direct the dragon to the sea with Eight Flavor Pill as the main remedy. For kidney deficiency with water evil overflowing, expel water downward with the Jin Kui Shenqi Pill. </p>
<p>For specific wheezing patterns that may resemble but are not true wheezing, characterized by noisy breathing and persistent sounds, the root cause may be phlegm-fire stagnation internally, with wind-cold constricting externally. This may arise from sitting or lying in dampness, from excess sour and salty food, or from accumulated fire steaming upwards. With deep and longstanding roots, complete eradication is difficult. Avoid wind and cold, and moderate rich flavors. </p>
<p>Do not use cooling agents, as they may obstruct the resolution of wind evils; avoid heating agents, as they may elevate phlegm-fire. Regulate Qi and disperse wind while not forgetting the fundamentals, for good treatment is achieved this way. Suitable herbs include Perilla seed, bitter orange peel, Platycodon root, magnolia flower, Pinellia, Trichosanthes fruit, Poria, and licorice.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>In the winter months, if the wind is fierce, add Mahuang; in the summer months, if there is a lot of phlegm, add Shigao; for those carrying cold, fresh ginger is often used. If wheezing occurs early in winter, it commonly starts in the late summer and early autumn before it turns cold. Utilize Da Chengqi to purge the heat, so that when winter arrives, there is no heat left to contain. This is an excellent method. The aforementioned points cover the broad outlines. If we consider the five organs, six bowels, seven emotions, and six energies, where do they not contribute to wheezing? One must understand that emphasizing one corner implies reflection on all three, to truly be considered insightful, which allows one to govern a person&#39;s fate.</p>
<p>In cases of exogenous cold with a lack of sweating and wheezing, or combined with Yangming syndrome leading to fullness in the diaphragm and wheezing, both call for Mahuang Decoction. If the pathogenic qi is confined and wheezing persists, even after sweating, it is necessary to induce further sweating using Mahuang, Xingzi, and Shigao. If there is misapplication of purging to the Taiyang leading to unending diarrhea, resulting in sweating, and a rapid pulse, use Ge Gen, Huang Lian, and Huang Qinq Decoction. After sweating in the Taiyang, if there is excessive drinking leading to water retention and wheezing, use Xiao Qinglong with the Mahuang removed and add Xingren; if there is fullness in the lower abdomen, add Fuling. If, after purging, there is slight wheezing and the exterior has not resolved, use Gui Zhi Decoction with Houpo and Xingren added. If water is retained under the heart, causing palpitations and wheezing due to kidney qi affecting the heart, use Wu Ling San. To resolve wheezing while the pulse remains depressed and reversed, use Li Zhong Tang and Si Ni Tang. For wheezing with rapid breathing and abdominal fullness, use Da Chai Hu Tang.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>In my view, wheezing and shortness of breath are different; shortness of breath is a manifestation of deficiency, while wheezing is a manifestation of excess. However, wheezing often indicates a deficiency, and shortness of breath can sometimes indicate an excess. New illnesses may also have underlying deficiencies; one should not hold rigid opinions on this matter. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; states that true wheezing arises when the lungs are overactive and obstructed, leading to difficulty in breathing due to blocked lung passages. If the pulse feels deep and firm, one should purge the lungs. Faint wheezing, on the other hand, indicates kidney deficiency, where one first feels short of breath, accompanied by fullness in the sides, with a weak left wrist pulse—this suggests kidney tonification is necessary. This kidney deficiency is not a sign of a new illness? </p>
<p>Lastly, wheezing due to pathogenic factors arises when evils invade the lungs, becoming lodged within, blocking the passages and causing difficulty in breathing. If the pulse is superficial and tight, this implies an external invasion.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>There are also cases in which the six organs are all subdued, and when it is necessary to disperse, the body heats up and the dyspnea subsides. This obstructive condition is difficult for people to recognize; is it not due to the excess in shortness of breath? In discussing the five organs of a person, all have upper qi, with the lungs being the master. They are situated above and form the canopy over the five organs, connecting with the defensive and nutritive qi, balancing yin and yang, allowing for ascent, descent, and movement without excess or deficiency. What illness can arise then? If invaded by wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness, the lung qi becomes distended, leading to dyspnea, rapid breathing, and restlessness in sitting and lying down. This may also arise from internal injury due to the seven emotions, causing stagnation and phlegm, or from deficiency in the spleen and stomach, which fail to nourish properly. Any phlegm in the body can cause dyspnea. </p>
<p>If one truly understands the presence of wind-cold, then use Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Qinglong Decoction. If one truly understands summer heat, then use Baihu Decoction. If one truly understands dampness, then use Shengshi Decoction. If one truly understands the stagnation of the seven emotions, then use Si Mo or Si Qi Decoction. Additionally, wood stagnation, fire stagnation, earth stagnation, metal stagnation, and water stagnation can all lead to dyspnea; the practitioner must discern these【all of the above fall under the category of excess conditions】.</p>
<p>Dongyuan says: In terms of pathological mechanisms, various kinds of atrophy, dyspnea, and vomiting all pertain to the upper body. It is further argued that those in the study of cold damage believe that dyspnea caused by fire heat indicates an excess evil present at the surface; cold transforms into heat, and excessive heart fire attacks the lungs, hence it pertains to the upper body. It is also suggested that people who indulge excessively in rich food or overly cherish their children can also accumulate heat above, leading to dyspnea, which should be treated with sweet and cooling remedies.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>When diet is not regulated, and emotions or labor occur at inappropriate times, the cold and heat of food and water can harm the six viscera, all due to insufficient vital energy. Symptoms like abdominal distension, cough, wheezing, vomiting, and inability to eat should be treated with warm, sweet, and pungent remedies. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: when the lungs are overflowing, there is coughing and shortness of breath, thirst and restlessness, fullness in the chest, and shortness of breath. These arise from the fire of the ren channel moving in the chest, linked to the lower burner, not belonging to the upper. Observations from Dongyuan’s discussions show there are conditions due to excess and the evil causing illnesses, while complex illnesses arise from deficiency. This clearly distinguishes between the root and branch of disease. When encountering primary illnesses, whether through sweating, vomiting, or purging, a single remedy may expel phlegm and relieve wheezing, producing immediate results. However, practitioners must be cautious with the successful outcomes and should not indiscriminately apply these remedies to deficient symptoms, as this could be dangerous. Liu Quanshan states: all methods for expelling phlegm and stopping wheezing work effectively on those who actually have phlegm. If a patient is deficient and has a floating, large pulse that feels empty upon pressure, it is contraindicated to purge; doing so would certainly worsen the condition and could be fatal. The classics say: all wheezing belongs to the upper. They also state: all counterflow belongs to fire.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Therefore, in Hejian, the wheezing condition is due to the heat below. Hua Tuo said: &quot;When the lung qi is abundant, there is wheezing.&quot; The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: &quot;Excess qi leads to wheezing.&quot; Later compilations of herbal evidence merely follow this. Only Wang Haizang argues that when qi is abundant, it should be recognized as qi being deficient; when there is excess, it should be understood as insufficient. If lung qi is indeed abundant and excessive, then the clear and descending actions should not lead to wheezing, right? Because the fire invades the lungs, scorching the true yin, the condition of deficiency arises as wheezing. What is described as abundance and excess is not the qi of the lungs, but the fire within them. Haizang&#39;s argument surpasses those before him, revealing the profound truths of all ages. It is regrettable that it only touches upon the beginnings without tracing the source of the fire. I foolishly believe that excess fire corresponds to insufficient water; excess yang corresponds to insufficient yin. All the fiery reversals arise from the lower jiao where the heartfire is emitted from the liver and kidneys, hence they are termed &quot;reversed.&quot; When kidney water is deficient and declining, the heartfire rises too strongly, consuming the lung metal. How can there be no wheezing? Danxi said: &quot;Wheezing has its roots in yin deficiency, with fire rising from the lower abdomen. It is suitable to use the Siwu Decoction with additions of Qingdai, Zhu Li, and Chen Pi, boiled with a child&#39;s urine for consumption.&quot;<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>If someone has a phlegm-ridden cough, they should take the Four Substances decoction with bitter orange and pinellia to nourish the yin and transform the phlegm. It is said that if the yin is deficient, it causes coughing, which is something that past practitioners did not realize. However, this method has led to misconceptions for future practitioners. The true deficiency lies in the essence of the kidneys; it is not simply about nourishing the blood with the Four Substances decoction. The fire that arises is from the lower burner, not something that can be suppressed by cold. Among patients, some have phlegm while others do not; the water rises with the wood and fire, and one cannot rely on bamboo sap, bitter orange, or pinellia to transform it. It is necessary to use the Six Flavor Rehmannia decoction with ophiopogon and a strong dose of five flavors to reinforce the water element, thus allowing the water to rise and the fire to descend, stabilizing the cough. This happens because the deficiency of the yin water generates fire; with fire, there is phlegm; with phlegm, there is coughing, which becomes more severe and leads to wheezing. This should be compared with the previously mentioned yin deficiency and its associated fire.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is another condition that resembles fire but is not fire, that resembles coughing but is not coughing. The classics state that the lesser yin refers to nausea, coughing, and wheezing; it occurs when the yin energy is below and the yang energy is above. When all the yang energies float without a place to settle, that is why there is wheezing.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The &quot;Huangdi Needle Classic&quot; states: If the stomach channels are not in harmony, wheezing occurs due to the rebellious qi of the Yangming. The qi of Yangming is supposed to descend, but now it rises upwards, hence the wheezing. When the True Yuan is depleted, wheezing issues arise from the kidney qi surging upwards. Such a person may not appear ill on ordinary days but feels short of breath, which is not actually true wheezing but qi that does not return to its origin. </p>
<p>Observing the external symptoms, the limbs are cold, the face is red, and there is irritability and aversion to heat, though it seems like fire, it is actually the fire of the True Yuan of the Mingmen, having left its palace without returning. Examining the pulse, though it feels large and rapid at the two-inch mark, at the two-foot mark it is weak and may feel present but is actually absent. Those who do not understand might think there is heat and use cooling herbs to clear it; thinking that the wheezing is urgent, they might assist with herbs like Si Mo to alleviate it. After swallowing, there seems to be slight improvement, but after a moment, it remains the same. </p>
<p>Little do they know that easing it by a little further depletes it even more. Indeed, seeing slight improvement, they mistakenly believe the medicine’s effect is insufficient and double the intake of cool, qi-promoting agents, immediately witnessing fatal results. Why is this? It is because when yin is deficient leading to wheezing, death is not far away. Fortunately, there is a thread of hope, tethered at the root of the Mingmen, lingering just a bit longer.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>A good ruler can seek the root cause and use remedies to assist in restoring the original state, allowing for a possible revival; however, this must not be done hastily. First, one should use compounds like the Eight-Treasure Pill, the Kidney-Calming Pill, and the Nourishing Essence Pill, along with ginseng and Shengmai Powder to help settle the energy. When the energy is somewhat stabilized, then a larger dose of ginseng and astragalus should be supplemented with additional ingredients like broken old paper, donkey-hide gelatin, and ox knee to calm the lower body. Additionally, the Eight-Treasure Pill should be combined with river vehicle to form pills, to be swallowed during bouts of hunger, day and night. Yet, this is still not sufficient; one must maintain separation from distractions and abstain from desires for many years to ensure preservation. Those who do not adhere to this prohibition will inevitably face demise. I express this for consideration, hoping that wise men will take preventive measures before illness strikes, rather than falling into this crisis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is another type of condition characterized by excessive heat, where all six pulses are weak, even submerged, with cold limbs that may lead to reverse coldness, breathlessness, and anxiety as if there is excess, yet the pulse is not tight. This indicates a long-standing accumulation of heat; the yang energy is impeded and cannot circulate to the surface, resulting in coldness of the body and a weak pulse, accompanied by confusion and breathlessness.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>At this time, one should not use cold herbs, nor should one use hot herbs. Only a blend of Xiao Yao San with substances like zhu and lian can disperse internal heat and promote sweating for recovery. After recovery, one should use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish yin and harmonize yang, which is best. This means that when fire is congested, it should be released, and when wood is distraught, it should be allowed to flow. This aligns with the &quot;Jin Kui&quot; which states that when the six pulses are depressed, they should be released so that heat recedes and breath stabilizes. The classic says: &quot;When fire is congested, people suffer from reduced energy, treated with cooling methods.&quot; </p>
<p>If asked why those with breath issues often cannot lie down, the &quot;Suwen&quot; indicates that those who cannot lie down and experience breathlessness are troubled by water qi. Water flows along the channels of body fluids. The kidneys are the water organ, governing body fluids, lying down, and breathing. Dong Yuan states that if a patient cannot lie down, but breathes heavily while lying down, it indicates that water qi is counteracting and affecting the lungs, causing the lungs to become waterlogged and preventing proper airflow. Zhongjing states that shortness of breath is associated with fluid retention. </p>
<p>The above discusses in detail the diagnosis and treatment of breathlessness due to yin deficiency. If breathlessness arises from yang deficiency, Dong Yuan has thoroughly covered this. For externally contracted breathlessness, Zhongjing has also addressed it completely. This is provided to establish foundational principles, hence additional emphasis is placed on Ba Wei and Liu Wei.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>On Breathlessness</strong></p>
<p>The disease of breathlessness is the most critical condition; if not treated correctly, it is rarely without consequence. To distinguish it, there are essentially two types. The first type is termed &quot;true breathlessness,&quot; and the second type is &quot;false breathlessness.&quot; These two types are opposites and should not be confused. </p>
<p>So how do we distinguish between them? True breathlessness is characterized by the presence of an external pathogen, while false breathlessness results from an absence of such a pathogen, relying instead on a deficiency of vital energy. In true breathlessness, the breath is prolonged and abundant; in false breathlessness, the breath is short and unsteady. </p>
<p>In true breathlessness, the chest feels swollen and the breath is coarse, the sound is loud and the panting is forceful, creating a sensation of fullness that can only be relieved by exhaling; in false breathlessness, the breath is quick and weak, the sound is low and the inhalation is short, creating a feeling of urgency as if the breath is about to stop, rising as if it cannot ascend, and swallowing as if it cannot connect, worsening with exertion and appearing hurriedly panting, only finding slight relief by extending a single breath.</p>
<p>Thus, one form is true breathlessness, and the other is mimic breathlessness. True breathlessness is attributed to the lungs, while mimic breathlessness is attributed to the kidneys.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>What is it? The lung is the master of qi, and the kidney is the root of qi. The lung governs the skin and hair and is located in the upper jiao. Thus, when pathogenic factors invade, qi in the upper jiao becomes congested, leading to wheezing. When qi is obstructed, it should be cleared and dispersed. The kidney governs essence and is located in the lower jiao. If true yin is deficient and essence cannot transform into qi, then there is an obstruction in the upward exchange, resulting in shortness of breath. Shortness of breath is the basis for distress. When qi is already short and further dissipated, it is like pressing on an egg. Moreover, when qi is abundant, the pulse will be slippery, rapid, and strong; whereas when qi is deficient with no pathogenic factors, the pulse will be weak and lacking spirit. This illustrates the difference in pulse conditions. If one sees a floating and surging pulse, or a greatly wide pulse that disappears with slight pressure, this indicates a pulse with no foundation. If the pulse fluctuates strongly and is exceedingly large and rapid, yet is entirely lacking in harmony, it signals a defeat of the stomach qi, both representing significant deficiency. However, the weakness of the pulse is easily recognized as true deficiency, while a floating and hollow pulse can be difficult to distinguish between true and false fullness. Nevertheless, the distinction in intensity can be observed here. The weak pulse is still manageable and easily treated, while the floating hollow pulse is the most perilous and variable. If the string-like pulse is excessively strong, it indicates a palpable disturbance in the zang organs and is not to be treated.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>All cases of wheezing are fundamentally due to qi deficiency. Among those with qi deficiency-induced wheezing, seven or eight out of ten show no external wind pathogens and no internal heat, indicating they are cases of weak wheezing. If the deficiency is in the spleen and lungs, it is confined to the upper jiao, where the transformation source is not yet depleted, making the condition relatively mild. However, if the deficiency is in the liver and kidneys, the illness arises from the lower jiao, affecting both root and branch, making the condition more severe. It is crucial to promptly address the root to support the true qi, thus allowing for recovery. In instances where the illness is prolonged and accompanied by worsening wheezing, or if chronic use of phlegm-resolving and qi-dispersing medications exacerbates the wheezing, or if there is wheezing above and diarrhea below, or if a woman experiences excessive blood loss after childbirth leading to a severe deficiency of nutritive qi, where the solitary yang is unsupported causing wheezing, this is termed the state of solitary yang devoid of yin, a condition of extreme depletion, which becomes difficult to treat. One must be wary of further depleting the surface.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>The condition of qi shortness, characterized by a person who shows no signs of cold or cough, suddenly experiences labored breathing. This may occur after slight exertion, during hunger, after seminal emission, after heavy sweating, or following urination or defecation. It may also worsen after a significant illness or for women after their menstrual period. If there is a sense of obstruction in the airways, making it seem as if the upper and lower parts are not connected, and if the condition seems critical, one should simply note that there are no external or internal pathogens, and the pulse is weak and feeble. In such cases, one should use the Zhengyuan decoction with adjustments as necessary, yielding divine results. Furthermore, preparations like Xiaoying decoction, Daying decoction, and Dabu Yuan decoction can also be selected for use. The classics state that if the liver feels tight, one should consume sweet foods to alleviate it, which is in line with this condition.</p>
<p>If there is diarrhea with coldness accompanying it, it is advisable to use the Right Returning Decoction, Right Returning Pill, or Shengzhu Decoction. If there is deficiency of spleen and lung qi, with slight heat and thirst in the upper burner causing wheezing, one should use the Shengmai Powder. If there is simply qi deficiency without heat, only Ginseng Decoction is appropriate. If the fire scorches the lung&#39;s metal element, and there is significant heat in the upper burner, frequent thirst, and sweating, leading to wheezing due to qi deficiency, one should use the Ren Shen Bai Hu Decoction. If fire resides in the yin aspects, one should use the Jade Woman Decoction. Nevertheless, this condition typically arises in summer; if yin deficiency causes fire from the lower abdomen to surge upwards and lead to wheezing, one should tonify yin and reduce fire, using the Liu Wei Di Huang Decoction with additions such as Huangbo and Zhimu. </p>
<p>Wheezing due to water disorders is linked to kidney evils affecting the lungs.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>However, if the water cannot transform, and the child suffers along with the mother, causing a failure of vital essence, how did it come to this? It is the vacuity that is nineteen parts, mixed within, but containing some solidity; thus, it may occasionally occur. Therefore, for treating water retention and wheezing, it is unwise to recklessly use aggressive medications. One should seek methods that target swelling; once the swelling subsides, the wheezing will stabilize on its own. The ancient method for treating water accumulation below the heart, which rises to the lungs causing wheezing and inability to lie down, is primarily to use the mysterious herbal formula. However, this formula predominantly addresses the vital energy aspect. If the water issue arises from Qi stagnation, it may be used. If it arises from Qi deficiency, one should employ the modified Shenqi Decoction. For the elderly and weak with prolonged illness leading to Qi deficiency and wheezing, one should primarily focus on nourishing the lungs. For those with excessive Yin, it is advisable to warm and nourish with ingredients such as ginseng, angelica, ginger, cinnamon, and licorice, or to include astragalus and poria. For those with excessive Yang, it is advisable to nourish with ingredients such as ginseng, cooked rehmannia, ophiopogon, ejiao, schisandra, pear jelly, and dairy products.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The evidence for the condition of “guan ge” manifested as breathlessness is described in the &quot;Treatise on the Six Meridians and Organ Symptoms.&quot; It states that when the &quot;renying&quot; pulse is strong at four levels or above, it indicates a yang condition, while when the &quot;cunkou&quot; pulse is strong at four levels or above, it indicates a yin condition. If both the renying and cunkou pulses are strong at four times above normal, it confirms the condition of guan ge. This diagnosis is based on the pulse rather than the illness itself. Currently, there are many individuals suffering from this condition, yet many remain unaware. Furthermore, recent practitioners of pulse diagnosis tend to focus exclusively on the cunkou pulse, disregarding the renying. If the pulses in both hands are excessively strong—floating and string-like to an extreme, four times or more—this indicates such a condition. The patient often experiences a restless, uneasy breathlessness, which is characterized by a feeling of pressure in the chest that can seem like swelling but is not truly swollen. The breath may feel short yet is not truly so, and even slight exertion or speaking can exacerbate the breathlessness. There may also be tremors throughout the body, along with feelings of anxiety and unrest. This condition is primarily due to emotional disturbances harming the yin, leading to a lack of foundational vital energy, resulting in a situation where the solitary yang is separated and chaotic. It is often difficult to treat.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>In the case of shortness of breath, if the pulse is weak and faint, it indicates a deficiency of yin within yang. If the pulse is floating, large, or hollow, and feels empty upon pressure, this indicates a deficiency of yin within yang. Generally, if the patient cannot lie down due to the difficulty in breathing and the pulse is of such nature, it signifies a severe deficiency of vital energy and is close to death. If one rashly administers draining treatments, it will only exacerbate the condition and lead to danger. The use of bitter cold or purgatives will certainly result in immediate death.</p>
<p>In the case of true shortness of breath, the pathogenic factor resides in the lungs. The pathogenic factor affecting the lungs is either wind-cold or fire. The wind-cold pathogen must be contracted from the surface of the skin, thus it enters the lungs and causes breathing difficulties. When fire is in excess, it injures metal (the lungs) and leads to shortness of breath as well. To treat wind-cold causing true shortness of breath, one should use warming and dispersing methods; to treat fire-heat causing true shortness of breath, one should use cooling methods.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>There is also a discussion on phlegm and wheezing. Previous experts all stated to treat phlegm, not knowing that phlegm cannot wheeze by itself, and that there must be a cause for the production of phlegm. Therefore, one should seek the root cause and treat it. Generally, when one is invaded by wind and cold from the outside, with obstruction in the lungs leading to cough and wheezing, one should use Liu&#39;an Decoction with a supplement of fine root or perilla leaves. If the invasion of wind and cold is severe in winter, one can add ephedra to the original formula, or use Xiao Qing Long Decoction, Hua Gai Powder, or San Ao Decoction types to address it. For cases with external wind and cold coupled with slight internal heat causing wheezing, Huang Qin Ban Xia Decoction should be used. If there is a combination of excessive Yangming fire and heat wrapped in cold, one should use cooling yet dispersing methods, such as Da Qing Long Decoction or Wu Hu Decoction, or Zhao Bi with Ban Xia Decoction types. If there is no external wind or cold, but only excessive fire causing wheezing, or even if there is slight cold but the emphasis is on fire, one should use Sang Bai Pi Decoction or Chou Xin Drink types to address it.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>When phlegm is abundant and causes wheezing, it is appropriate to treat the phlegm with formulas such as Erchen Decoction, Liu’an Decoction, Daotan Decoction, Qianqin Decoction, Gunphlegm Pill, or Baolong Pill, all of which can address wheezing caused by excessive phlegm. Formulas like Liu Jun Zi Decoction and Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction can treat wheezing due to deficient phlegm. However, phlegm itself is merely a symptom of an underlying condition, so there must be a source causing the phlegm. Therefore, if phlegm arises from heat, the heat must be treated first; if from cold, the cold must be expelled first. Additionally, phlegm can also be generated from repressed qi, wind pathogens, damp stagnation, or weakness in the spleen and kidneys. If any of these factors contribute, they can lead to phlegm formation. If one attempts to treat phlegm without addressing its root cause, then the phlegm will never be resolved, and the wheezing cannot be cured. </p>
<p>If the qi level is affected by pathogens, and there is excess qi in the upper jiao causing wheezing, or if emotional stress has caused liver injury, a robust person exhibiting fullness and a strong pulse can simply relieve the qi to self-recover from wheezing. In such cases, formulas like Kuaqing Yin, Sìchuāng Yin, Sìqī Decoction, Radish Seed Decoction, or Suzi Jiangqi Decoction are suitable. If there is stagnated qi in the Yangming channel leading to fullness, a mild purgative may be beneficial.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Asthma</strong></p>
<p>Asthma has its deep-rooted origins, and can be triggered by cold or exertion; it is also referred to as wheezing and asthma. When it is not manifesting, one should primarily focus on reinforcing the vital energy; when it does manifest, the main focus should be on eliminating the pathogenic factors. To reinforce the vital energy, one must differentiate between yin and yang. If there is deficiency, one should tonify yin; if there is yang deficiency, one should tonify yang. To eliminate pathogenic factors, one must assess the severity; one may need to dispel wind, warm cold, or clear phlegm and heat. However, in chronic cases, the vital energy is invariably deficient, so during the process of dispelling, it is advisable to cautiously add warmth and tonification, or to appropriately increase the dispersing methods within the tonification. In such instances, one should always focus on nourishing the original qi, ensuring that it gradually fills up, for this gives hope for gradual recovery. If one excessively attacks, there has never been a case where it does not lead to worsening and danger.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>For urgent treatment, one must not delay even for a moment. When a person suddenly catches a wind-imbalance, and cold enters the lung meridian, it can lead to immediate wheezing, raised shoulders, labored breathing, and difficulty in expelling phlegm, making it impossible to lie down. The prescription includes one cash each of Chai Hu, Dang Gui, Huang Qin, Gan Cao, Ban Xia, and She Gan, and two cash each of Jie Geng, Mai Dong, and Fu Ling, to be decocted and taken. This formula excels in using Chai Hu, She Gan, and Jie Geng to disseminate and release the lung&#39;s vital energy, employing Ban Xia to eliminate phlegm, and using Huang Qin to clear heat. When one is externally invaded by cold, it must internally transform into a heat syndrome; thus, Huang Qin is used for its cleansing and resolving properties. However, using only Huang Qin, while it is said to clear heat, may inadvertently suppress the fire energy. The brilliance lies in the combination of Jie Geng, She Gan, and Chai Hu, which are warming and dispersive, effectively extinguishing fire and eliminating the pathogen. This is one method for urgent treatment.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>When a person experiences breathlessness and cannot lie down, and their phlegm flows out like a spring, yet their tongue is not dry and the breathlessness is not severe, lying down exacerbates the condition. This is not due to external causative wind but rather the cold energy within the kidneys. When there is no fire in the kidneys, the water has nothing to nourish it, rising up and causing phlegm. The water in the stomach then assists this surging force and cannot be stopped. The proper treatment is to use the Six Flavor Pill Decoction with the addition of a large dose of aconite and cinnamon, which will heat the kidney palace, allowing the water to return. Once the water returns to the palace, the breathlessness will subside and the person can lie down peacefully. For a person to sleep, the kidney energy and lung energy must interact; only then can the pathway be smooth and free from chaos. In the prescription, nourishing kidney fire allows for peaceful sleep. It is important to note that the kidney is the mother of the lung; when the child is at peace, the mother is also tranquil. The lung&#39;s metallic energy can return to the kidney palace to nourish its dissipating energy. Hence, nourishing kidney fire is truly a means to also nourish the lung&#39;s metal.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Is the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan truly a miraculous remedy for nourishing kidney essence? It balances water and fire, providing stability to the lung&#39;s metal element; when the lungs and kidneys are harmonized, is there anyone who cannot sleep soundly yet feels very comfortable?</p>
<p>There are different types of wheezing; some are due to deficiency, while others are due to excess. For excess wheezing, if the symptoms appear heavy and are less pronounced, use two qian of Huang Qin, three qian of Mai Dong, five fen of Gan Cao, and one qian each of Chai Hu, Su Ye, Shan Dou Gen, Ban Xia, and Wu Yao. Decoction in water and consume; one dose will stop the wheezing, and no further doses are necessary. However, in cases of wheezing due to excess, the breath is often rapid, the throat makes noise, and the shoulders lift—unlike deficient wheezing, which is less urgent, with a silent throat and relaxed shoulders. Deficient wheezing indicates significant kidney deficiency, with the spleen’s energy on the verge of collapse, hence the urgent upward surges that struggle to break through but have not yet done so.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The formula to alleviate severe breathlessness contains the following ingredients: one tael each of ginseng and prepared rehmannia, three qian each of shan zhu yu and white mustard seed, five qian of ophiopogon, one qian each of schisandra and achyranthes. Brew with water and take. One dose may provide slight relief, two doses can stop wheezing, and ten doses can lead to full recovery. This condition is indeed a sign of imminent death; fortunately, a faint breath lingers in the upper and lower realms. If cool medicines are used to balance the fire, it hastens their demise. Similarly, using cinnamon and aconite to supplement the fire will also accelerate the end. When the vital energy approaches extinction, it should be gently supported, not urgently restored, just like a dying fire that still has a few embers—kindling it with firewood is advisable. If one abruptly throws sulfur or similar substances onto it, the fire will be extinguished. Moreover, using cold and cool substances to stir it leads to a rare chance of renewal. The brilliance of this formula lies in its combination of kidney and lung tonics. When used together with ginseng, it directly penetrates the very essence of yin, giving rise to kidney energy, which in turn generates lung energy, thus sustaining life in the realm of nothingness. Furthermore, ginseng nourishes the lungs to support the kidneys, promoting a mutual generation that can truly save one from death.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 284: Asthma Section</strong></p>

If there is deficiency, there will be little qi and inability to breathe out, ear deafness, and dryness in the throat, and need to take from the channels of the Taiyin, Yangming, and Jueyin.

<p>If the evil is in the lungs, it results in skin pain, alternating chills and fever, breathlessness, sweating, and coughing that affects the shoulders and back.

Also treat the area above the pubic bone to release it.</p>
<p>For fullness in the chest and breathlessness, puncture the tip of the big toe on the foot&#39;s Taiyin channel, marking slightly inside the nail like chive leaves. Retain it for cold and hasten in case of heat until the Qi descends and settles.</p>

To address Heavenly Appearance, one should not exceed one mile.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Classic&quot; states: headache and neck pain, sudden onset of stiffness, nasal obstruction and bleeding, wheezing that cannot be alleviated should be treated through the master of the heavens. Wind-related headaches, aversion to wind and cold, nasal bleeding and obstruction, and unrelieved wheezing are under the authority of the Spirit of Transcendence. Wheezing and nasal bleeding, pain in the inner shoulder blades making it difficult to look up or down, with pain and fullness in the lower abdomen pulling towards the side, is governed by Yi Xi.</p>

<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Conducting Filial Piety,&quot; it states: A man experienced wheezing and fullness in his chest and abdomen, often making sounds, unable to freely exhale or inhale. Initially, he was treated with the &quot;Dusheng Powder,&quot; which induced vomiting. After vomiting, he was given &quot;Daoshui Wan&quot; and &quot;Yugong San,&quot; with a mild purging of three to four bowel movements. When there was no improvement, he was given &quot;Lige Wan&quot; to purge further, ensuring the upper and lower parts were unblocked. Afterward, he took &quot;Pingwei San,&quot; &quot;Wuling San,&quot; and &quot;Sanhe San,&quot; using medicine to regulate the yin and yang and promote water passage, which ultimately led to recovery.</p>
<p>In &quot;Danxi&#39;s Heart Method,&quot; it mentions: I treated a woman over fifty years old who had a history of phlegm cough. Suddenly one day, she experienced severe wheezing, with phlegm coming out like a spring, sweating heavily, and her pulse was floating and surging, resembling a life-threatening condition. Being present at that time, I quickly used four qian of Ophiopogon, two qian of ginseng, and one qian and five fen of Schisandra, boiling them into a decoction for her to take. The wheezing settled, and the sweating stopped; after three doses, the phlegm gradually decreased. I then provided the previous formula, adding one qian and five fen of Trichosanthes fruit, and one qian each of Baiyuan, Angelica, Peony, and Scutellaria. After over twenty doses, she was stable. This was indeed due to the effects of Ophiopogon, Schisandra, and ginseng. If there were symptoms of spontaneous sweating along with abdominal fullness and a firm pulse, it indicates internal excess, and purging would be appropriate.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>A child aged fourteen years has a cough that flares up every ten days. This illness is located in the upper jiao and does not allow for sweat to be released. It arises at the transition of September to October, and is best treated with warm dispersal methods and Xiao Wei Dan for recovery. </p>
<p>A person suffering from breathlessness for six or seven months cannot lie down. This is a lung issue, treated with two qian of Ma Huang and Shi Gao, along with one qian each of Chai Hu, Sang Bai Pi, and Huang Qin, and five fen of Gan Cao. After taking this, a sweat is induced and the patient recovers. Afterward, Ren Shen, Wu Wei Zi, Sang Bai Pi, Huang Qin, and Gan Cao are used for stabilization.</p>
<p>Another person with excessive phlegm and urgent wheezing is treated with one liang each of Bai Zhu, Ban Xia, Cang Zhu, and Xiang Fu Zi, and half a liang each of Huang Qin and Xing Ren, formed into pills with ginger juice, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In the beginning of autumn of the Jiwei year, three days later, I received an imperial edict to go to Liupan Mountain. By mid-August, the continuous rain did not cease. I was tasked with treating the wife of General Yuan Shu, who was over fifty years old and overweight due to excessive consumption of alcohol and milk, resulting in abdominal distension and shortness of breath, with sounds heard outside the room, making it impossible to lie down comfortably. Her bowel movements were slow, with a bounding pulse that was twice the normal rate, while the Guan pulse was deep, slow, and powerful. I considered the dampness from the misty rain and the heat from her food, noting that the excess damp heat ascended to the lungs, causing chaotic energy, thus leading to breathlessness and fullness. When the evil qi is strong, it tends to be solid, and solid conditions should be treated with purgation. Therefore, I prepared Ping Qi San to purify and reduce it. After one dose, her condition improved by half, and after a second dose, her wheezing resolved, though she still had discomfort in the chest and stomach, feelings of heat and dryness in the mouth, and occasional coughing, which I treated with a modified Xie Bai San.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>The King of Zhen Ding, at nineteen years of age, suffered from a chronic illness. His left side was swollen like an overturned cup, his abdomen was distended like a drum, and he displayed many blue veins. He experienced shortness of breath and could not lie down. During the summer rains, he took laxatives to relieve his condition, and in the afternoon he felt feverish, while at night he had night sweats, prompting him to urgently seek help. I went to examine him, and found his pulse to be floating and rapid, with no strength upon pressure. I told the sick man: &quot;In treating accumulation, one should not strike at it with toxic medications.&quot; As stated in the &quot;Medical Compendium,&quot; there was once a military man captured by bandits, placed in a boat beneath the planks, and after several days he managed to escape. They gorged themselves when hungry, but after a long time, when they removed their clothes to scratch themselves for lice, the next day they fell ill with wind-cold, resulting in spontaneous sweating and difficulty in digestion. One doctor diagnosed it as food stagnation and prescribed purgatives, while another attributed it to exposure after removing clothing, treating it with sweating therapies. After several mixed treatments, the patient gradually felt more dazed and fatigued, and his breath became laborious. Upon diagnosis, I concluded it was a mild case of exterior syndrome with slight wheezing, and prescribed the Gui Zhi and Hou Po Xing Ren decoction, which is the method of Zhang Zhongjing. I instructed the physician to hastily administer the medicine; after one sip, his wheezing subsided, with another sip causing profuse sweating. By evening, his body was cool, and his pulse had stabilized. The physician remarked: &quot;In my lifetime, I have never used Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s formula, and I did not know it was so effective.&quot;<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>It should not be done. Now that the pulse is weak like this, how can we dare to treat it with ordinary methods? Therefore, we administered a formula to promote digestion and nutrition, and after a few doses, the bowel movements regulated themselves. By balancing the energies of yin and yang, and moderating food intake, the abdomen noticeably reduced, and the stomach&#39;s energy became slightly stable. We interspersed this treatment with lighter remedies, and in just under a month, there was significant improvement. My former teacher once said: &quot;The ancient sage Jiagu said: Nourishing the right will naturally lead to elimination of excess.&quot; Just like a gathering full of gentlemen, even with one lone scoundrel among them, there is no way he could thrive. Now, if we strengthen the true energy and the stomach&#39;s vitality, the excess will naturally be resolved. The words of Jiagu cannot be misleading! The texts say: &quot;When there is a great accumulation, consume most of it and then stop.&quot; Even when the center is full of accumulated energy, one must not overuse potent remedies; how much more so should we be cautious when there is accumulation in a weakened state? This is also a method for treating accumulation. It is essential to carefully discern between what is pathogenic and what is righteous, between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>The &quot;Essential Transmission of Medicine&quot; states: In Dongyang, there was a man of over fifty years who suffered from asthma. In September, he developed symptoms of fever and chills, with serious breathing difficulties. His pulse was strong and seemingly full. One physician diagnosed it as typhoid fever and treated it with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Zhi Ke and Chen Pi among other herbs. After six days, he wanted to apply a large action of purging. One physician said it was inappropriate and suggested treating it as food stagnation, recommending Zhi Shi Dao Zhi Wan. Unable to reach a conclusion, they summoned me for consultation. Both physicians insisted that the pulse was strong and the qi abundant, indicating the need for purging. After my examination, I explained that this was a strong pulse of heat, not a true fullness. Observing his shortness of breath, which was not sufficient for rest, I determined to apply a treatment for deficiency. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, and included three fen of Fu Zi. After decocting and administering two doses, the pulse began to constrict. After four doses, the illness had lightened, and after six doses, he was fully recovered and at ease.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Medicine&quot; states: When Zhu Ningyu from the Taixue was in charge, he experienced severe wheezing and excessive phlegm. He could sit but not lie down, could bend forward but not lean back, anxiously seeking treatment. I said: There is great fullness above and deficiency below. Therefore, I prescribed a dose of Di Huang Wan (Rehmannia Pill) weighing one liang, with three qian of Jie Geng (Platycodon), two qian of Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange), one qian of Gan Cao (Licorice), and one qian of Ban Xia (Pinellia). After brewing it as a decoction and administering it, he was soon at ease.</p>
<p>To the advisor Huang Jian&#39;an, suffering from severe deficiency of Qi, with fever and spontaneous sweating, and wheezing. Upon diagnosis, his pulse was large and rapid, yet felt absent upon palpation; this indicated true cold internally and false heat externally. He should have taken Li Zhong Tang (Regulating the Middle Decoction) to cool the body. However, the family had no leader and could not follow directions, only using a remedy to clear heat and transform phlegm, which eventually led to his death.</p>
<p>The wife of the regional official Ye Zhenying was wheezing with a feeling of fullness and oppression; her skin felt scorched and she sweated profusely, unable to close her eyes. Upon diagnosis, her six pulses were all large. It was precisely as described: sweating like oil, wheezing incessantly—a clear case of severe illness. She refused treatment and passed away three days later.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>The daughter of my friend Song Jingfu suffered from a deficiency of vital energy, having little appetite and feeling weak. At the beginning of spring, she suddenly experienced severe shortness of breath, losing consciousness and feeling cold in her hands and feet. Many believed she would die instantly. I said that her vital energy was extremely weak and the metal element (lung energy) was not clear and purifying, which impeded downward movement. Without a powerful warming tonic, there was no hope for recovery. I then administered one tael of ginseng, three qian of dried ginger, three qian of prepared aconite, and five qian of white atractylodes; after one dosage, she revived. Later, she took over seven jins of ginseng, and two jins each of ginger and aconite, and was completely cured without recurrence.</p>
<p>Another friend&#39;s daughter, Sun Fang, had a long-standing cough and wheezing. She had tried numerous remedies aimed at regulating qi, transforming phlegm, clearing heat, and descending fire, but none were effective. One day, when her wheezing became particularly severe and she felt very irritable, I examined her eyes, which were bulging; her nose, which was flaring; and her pulse, which was floating and large, indicating clear lung congestion. I then prescribed a modified Ban Xia Hou Po Tang, and after one dose, her condition improved; after a second dose, she recovered. I remarked that although she had recovered, it was still unreliable. She needed to use ginseng and atractylodes to replenish her essentials, nourish the metal energy, making the channels clear and functional. However, she neglected to regulate and nourish herself for about a month, and her condition recurred, becoming irreparable.</p>
<p>Literary figure Gu Minghua had suffered from a cough for ten years, trying hundreds of medicines to no avail. Upon examining his pulse, I found it thin and weak. I stated that the weakness was due to phlegm, fire, wind, and cold, having lingered for a long time and become deeply rooted. He needed to nourish his body for a month and utilize methods of purging and downward movement. In six months, after purging and downing ten times, and taking over a hundred herbal tonics, he was cured. Moreover, I advised him to take a tonic for replenishing Qi in the form of medicinal pills, adding quail eggs and autumn stones, which he took for over a year without relapse.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: In Liyang, a young boy of Hong Ji suffered from phlegm and wheezing, not nursing or eating for five days and nights. The doctor warned of a critical condition. His wife dreamed of Guanyin, who instructed her to give him a ginseng and walnut soup. Hong Ji quickly procured a small piece of Korean ginseng and one walnut kernel, boiling them into a soup and administering it; the wheezing stopped immediately. The next day, he used the soup after removing the walnut skin, but the wheezing returned. He then used it with the skin on, and after a night, he recovered. This formula is not recorded in books. It is believed that ginseng helps relieve wheezing, and the walnut skin can consolidate the lungs.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: There was a sturdy military man who usually did not have a lot of appetite and did not enjoy hot food; he experienced shortness of breath when walking, claiming he had a buildup of old phlegm. He took a medicine called Beiji Wan to address it, but his pulse was rapid and strong with no presence when pressed deeply. I thought his Mingmen fire was weakened, and he had deficiency and cold in the spleen and lungs. I combined it with Ba Wei Wan, which slightly alleviated the phlegm and wheezing. After several doses, the symptoms completely stopped, allowing him to enjoy hot drinks and food. This Beiji Wan, thought to be made by people from the Western Regions, is said to be effective because their environment is harsh, and their people do not wear protective clothing, making their bodies resilient against illness. Diseases arise from within, and thus should be treated with potent medications. From this perspective, it seems that it cannot be used indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The physician Lu Yizhai, who had little appetite, suddenly experienced phlegm obstructing his breathing, with his head shaking and eyes blinking, and he could not check his pulse properly. Observing his complexion, yellow with a hint of green, indicated that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen earth, resembling a child&#39;s chronic fright syndrome. First, he used Liu Jun, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma to calm him, followed by a Baizhong Yiqi addition with Ban Xia, leading to a full recovery.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　喘，火气甚为夏热，衰为冬寒。故病寒则气衰而息微，病热则气盛而息粗。又寒水为阴，主乎迟缓；热火为阳，主乎急数。故寒则息迟气微，热则息数气粗而为喘也。<br>　　　　东垣十书 【元　李杲】</p>

<p>　　此当以经言邪气盛则实断之。华佗云：盛则为喘，减则为枯。故《活人》亦云：发喘者，气有余也。凡看文字须会得本意。盛则为喘者，非肺气盛也；喘为肺气有余者，亦非气有余也。气盛当认作气衰，有余当认作不足。肺气果盛，又为有余，则当清肃下行而不喘，以其火入于肺，衰与不足而为喘焉。故言盛者，非言肺气盛也，言肺中之火盛也。言有余者，非言肺气有余也，言肺中之火有余也。故泻肺以苦寒之剂，非泻肺也，泻肺中之火，实补肺气也。平居则气和，行动则气喘者，属冲脉之火。滋肾丸主之。<br>　　　　丹溪心法 【元　朱震亨】<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p>

<p>　　急治者，不可须臾缓也。如人忽感风邪，寒入乎肺经，以致一时喘急，抬肩大喘，气逆痰吐不出，又不能卧是也。方用柴胡，当归、黄芩、甘草、半夏、射干各一钱，桔梗、麦冬、茯苓各二钱，水煎服。此方妙在用柴胡、射干、桔梗以舒发肺金之气，用半夏以祛痰，用黄芩以去火。盖外感寒邪，则内必变为热证，今用黄芩以清解之。然徒用黄芩，虽曰清火，转足以抑遏其火气，妙在用桔梗、射干、柴胡一派辛散之品，转足以消火灭邪，此急治之一法。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>　　凡人有气喘不得卧，吐痰如泉涌者，舌不燥而喘不甚，一卧则喘，如此非外感之风邪，乃肾中之寒气也。盖肾中无火，则水无所养，乃上泛而为痰，将胃中之水，尽助其汹涌之势，而不可止遏矣。法当用六味丸汤加附子、肉桂大剂饮之，则肾宫火热，而水有所归，水既归宫，喘逆之气，亦下安而可卧。盖人之卧，必得肾气与肺气相交，而后河车之路，平安无奔逆也。方中补其肾火，何以安然能卧？不知肾为肺之子，子安则母亦宁。肺金之气，可归于肾宫，以养其耗散之气矣，此所以补肾火，正所以养肺金也。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>况六味丸全是补肾水之神剂乎？水火同补，而肺金更安，肺肾相安，有不卧之而甚适者乎？　　喘证不同，有虚喘，有实喘。实喘看其证若重而实轻，用黄芩二钱，麦冬三钱，甘草五分，柴胡、苏叶、山豆根、半夏、乌药各一钱，水煎服，一剂喘止，不必再服也。然实证之喘气太急，喉必作声，肩必抬起，非若虚喘气少急而喉无声，肩不抬也。虚喘乃肾气大虚，而脾气又复将绝，故奔冲而上，欲绝尚未绝也。<a id="orig-60p" href="#trans-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>方用救绝止喘汤，人参、熟地各一两，山茱萸、白芥子各三钱，麦冬五钱，五味子、牛膝各一钱，水煎服。一剂轻，二剂喘止，十剂全愈。此病实死证也，幸几微之气，留连于上下之间，若用凉药以平火，是速其亡也。然用桂附以补火，亦速其亡。盖气将绝之时，宜缓续而不宜骤续，譬如炉中火绝，止存星星之火，宜用薪炭引之。若遽投之以硫黄之类，反灭其火矣。更以寒凉之物动之，鲜有生气矣。方中妙在一派补肾补肺之药，与人参同用，则直入于至阴之中而生其气，肾气生而肺气亦生，自能接续于无何有之乡。况人参又上生肺以助肾之母，子母相生，更能救绝也。<a id="orig-61p" href="#trans-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>古今图书集成医部全录卷二百八十四</p>

<p>Zangqi Methodology - Kinds of Discussion</p>
<p>In lung disease, there is wheezing, coughing, and reversed qi, along with shoulder and back pain, and sweating. In kidney disease, there is abdominal swelling, swollen shins, wheezing, coughing, and a heavy body.<br>(Note: The lungs govern the qi of the whole body, while the kidneys are the source of vital essence.)</p>
<p>Discussions on Regulating Menstruation</p>
<p>When qi is excessive, there will be wheezing and cough with ascending qi.<br>(Note: The lungs govern qi and control breathing, hence when excessive, they cause wheezing and cough with upward reversal.)</p>
<p>Yin and Yang Distinction Discussion</p>
<p>When yin struggles within and yang disturbs externally, if the corporeal soul&#39;s sweat is not contained, it rises and causes trouble, which in turn aggravates the lungs and leads to wheezing.<br>(Note: The corporeal soul&#39;s sweat pertains to the lungs. The vital essence returns to the lungs, which connect to the hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin. If the skin sweats while the essence and blood remain stored in yin, then if the corporeal soul&#39;s sweat is not contained, it drains and harms the essence and blood. If the yin fluids of the lungs leak outward, then the yins of the four organs also rise, creating upward disturbance in the lungs, causing rapid wheezing and hoarse voice.)</p>
<p>Diseases of the dual yang affect the heart and spleen, which cannot hide the curves; if women do not have their monthly cycle, it transmits as wind disappearance. If it transmits as hiccup, it leads to death without treatment.<br>(Note: The dual yang refers to the Yangming stomach. The disease arises from dual deficiency in essence and blood, with wind-heat interacting fiercely and fluids increasingly depleted. Fire destroys metal and leads to urgent wheezing and shoulder distress, resulting in death without treatment.)</p>

<p><strong>On Pulse Reactions</strong></p>
<p>What is called &quot;wheezing above due to water&quot; in the Yangming channel occurs when the Yin energy descends and then rises again.

The Yin energy returns to the water organs, and when the rising Yin energy becomes stronger, water pathogens ascend with the Qi, thereby occupying the organs, leading to wheezing and water retention.</strong> </p>
<p>In the Shaoyin context, &quot;vomiting, coughing, and wheezing&quot; occur because the Yin energy is below and the Yang energy is above; all the Yang energies rise without a foundation to rely on, thus causing vomiting, coughing, and wheezing.<br><strong>Note: The cold water of Shaoyin is below, while the fire energy is above. When water and fire do not interact, the Yang energy rises and floats without support, leading to the upward reversal of Yang heat, which manifests as vomiting, cough, and wheezing.</strong></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Excess Heat Affecting the Body</strong></p>
<p>Due to heat, one sweats and feels restless, leading to panting and drinking. In calmness, one speaks excessively. The body feels like burning coals, and sweat flows out and dissipates. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the evil heat is intense, it affects the body—heart governs the pulses, hence the heart feels troubled. The lungs are the cover of the heart, so when troubled, one pants and drinks. If not troubled and calm, this evil still resides in the qi division, causing harm to the spirit. When qi is deficient, one speaks excessively. The yang evil of heaven injures one&#39;s yang energy, and these two types of yang clash, causing the body to feel like burning coals. The evil of yang heat releases because of the yin fluids in the body, thus leading to sweating and dispersal.</p>
<p>Excessive sweetness leads to heart qi being full, causing dark coloration and imbalance in kidney qi.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Excessive sweetness solidifies the earth qi; when the earth is solid, the heart qi cannot transmit to the child (descendants), hence the fullness and panting. The kidneys govern water, which is black in color; excessive earth damages the kidneys, resulting in dark coloration and imbalance in kidney qi.</p>
<p><strong>The Large Theory of Yin and Yang Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>When yang prevails, the body feels hot, pores are closed, and panting is coarse. This causes a need to bend or look up; sweating does not occur, yet there is heat, and teeth feel dry. It leads to restlessness, abdominal fullness, and a sense of impending death—able to endure winter, but not summer. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The predominance of yang leads to the stress of fire and heat, thus causing body heat. When heat is on the surface, the pores are closed; when internal, it leads to coarse panting. When yin prevails in the abdomen, one bends down; when yang prevails in the back, one looks up. When yang is dominant throughout the body, sweating does not occur, thus leading to heat. This condition is a sign of the excess of yang heat and thus can prolong life in winter but cannot survive in summer.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, with a color that is not green; when ill, it is likely to be heavy like a battering pulse, due to blood accumulating beneath the ribs, causing the person to wheeze and inhale in distress. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the True Organs</strong></p>
<p>If the autumn pulse is insufficient, it causes wheezing, a weak breath, and coughing; in severe cases, there may be blood in the sputum, and one can hear the sounds of illness. The texts state: When the qi is blocked in the lungs, it causes anxiety; and when it is insufficient, it leads to qi deficiency, causing wheezing and a weak breath. If the qi is deficient and reversely ascends, then blood follows and rises; if the qi retreats downward, one hears the sounds of moans associated with illness. Severe decay in the bones and significant indentation in the flesh, coupled with fullness of qi in the chest, leads to discomfort in breathing; if the qi moves the body, death is expected within six months. When the true organ pulse is observed, it signifies the date of death. The commentary explains that due to yangming qi blockage, the breathing becomes hindered. The movement of qi within the body indicates heart disease that wishes to communicate with the lung. Since the lungs govern qi, excessive qi leads to motion in breathing. The true organ pulse is firm and pounding, resembling the bunched up grains of Job&#39;s tears. The date of death is expected during the midnight of the ren and gui days.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>When yangming is stagnant, it results in wheezing and lamentation; lamentation denotes aversion to others. 【Note: The heat of yangming rises against shaoyin, causing the balance of yin and yang to falter, leading to fear and aversion to others.】 Stagnation and reversal can lead to death if it involves the organs but can lead to life if it involves the meridians.<br>【Note: For example, if the heat evil stagnates upwards, disrupting the channels related to the heart and lungs, it causes wheezing and lamentation; disrupting the heart and lung organs leads to death.】<br>The Reversal Regulation Theory</p>

<p>Labour leads to panting and sweating; both internally and externally, there is excess, thus the vital energy is depleted.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Lung obstruction manifests as restlessness, panting, and vomiting. </p>
<p>Heart obstruction results in obstructed pulses, restlessness leads to a distended sensation below the heart, and sudden gasping occurs. The heart governs the pulse; hence obstruction causes the pulse to be unresponsive. The pathogens disturb the area below the heart, affecting the heart itself, resulting in restlessness and the distended sensation below the heart. The lungs cover the heart, and as the heart&#39;s pulse extends to the lungs, reversed energy surges upward, causing panting.</p>
<p>Intestinal obstruction involves frequent drinking without relief, internal energy contends, and occasional diarrhea occurs. </p>
<p>Intestinal obstruction refers to both the small and large intestines. The small intestine, being a subordinate of the heart, governs urination; obstruction affecting the small intestine leads to heat accumulation above causing frequent drinking, while below it results in retention of urination. The large intestine, a subordinate of the lungs, governs defecation; obstruction affecting the large intestine results in internal energy contention above, while below it leads to diarrhea.</p>

<p>To puncture at the cavity of the chest allows the internal qi to escape, causing the person to wheeze and cough. The key to puncturing is that the qi arrives, producing an effect. If the pulse is sunken and the qi instead flows downward, it leads to counterproductive symptoms like coughing and wheezing. The classic states: when qi rises to the chest, one cannot stand for long due to wheezing; the illness pertains to the large intestine, as the large intestine is the organ coupled with the lungs. Puncturing in the center of the chest, thus, targets the lung in cases of wheezing and counterflow of breath.</p>

<p>The governance of the low Yin aligns with the celestial; the ending Qi is dry, causing movement, while excess fire internally constrains, resulting in swelling above, leading to coughing and wheezing.<br><em>[Note: The ending Qi is governed by the Yangming dry metal, thus with dryness moving, heat internally constrains, causing coughing and blood-related symptoms.]</em></p>

<p>Pure Qi resides in the Yin, while turbid Qi exists in the Yang; nourishing Qi flows smoothly through the channels, while defensive Qi moves in reverse. The interaction of pure and turbid causes disorder in the chest, which is called great disorder; when disordered in the lungs, there is difficulty in exhalation and inhalation, necessitating hand support for breathing.<br><em>[Note: The interaction of pure and turbid refers to the nourishing and defensive Qi corresponding to the Yin and Yang pathways.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Diagnosis and Treatment of Respiratory Illness</h3>
<p>The chapter on Damp diseases states: When afflicted by dampness, the body aches and has fever, the face becomes sallow and wheezing occurs, accompanied by headaches, nasal congestion, and restlessness. The pulse is large, yet the person can still eat and the abdomen feels comfortable. The ailment lies in cold dampness in the head, hence the nasal blockage. Administering internal medicine into the nose would alleviate this.</p>
<p>The chapter on Blood Stasis states: In men with a pale complexion, this indicates thirst and loss of blood, along with sudden palpitations; a floating pulse indicates internal deficiency. When the pulse is deep, weak, and slow, it is termed &quot;dispersed qi&quot;; such individuals experience shortness of breath while moving quickly, cold in the hands and feet, abdominal fullness, and in severe cases, diarrhea and undigested food.</p>
<p>The chapter on Lung Abscess and Lung Atrophy states: When asking about a cough that reverses, how can one determine it is a lung abscess? There should be purulent blood; expectorating it would signify death. What kind of pulse is it? The teacher said: The pulse at the inch is weak and rapid, weak indicates wind, rapid indicates heat; weak leads to sweating, rapid leads to aversion to cold. Wind affects the protective qi, causing breath to be obstructed; heat attacks the nourishing qi, causing inhalation to fail. Wind harms the skin and hair, heat damages the blood vessels. Wind resides in the lungs, causing cough, dry mouth, wheezing, fullness in the chest, dry throat without thirst, and excessive thick phlegm with occasional shivering. Where heat has passed, blood stagnates, leading to abscesses and pus, expectorating like rice porridge. It can be saved in its early stage; if pus has formed, it leads to death.</p>
<p>For upper respiratory issues with facial swelling and shoulder breathing, a floating and large pulse indicates it is untreatable; if combined with diarrhea, it is even worse.</p>
<p>For wheezing and restlessness, it pertains to lung distention, which can improve with sweating.</p>
<p>For severe upward qi obstruction with pharyngeal discomfort, stopping the reverse qi requires the prescription of Mai Men Dong Decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Swelling in the upper body, rapid breath; the flowing pulse forms accordingly. Suddenly, the subtle response is hard to save, as the divine powers are exhausted, leaving no life. The breath is direct, and the lips are parched; the face is swollen and dark, making escape difficult.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: all qi belongs to the lungs, and all wheezing also pertains to the lungs. Thus, a person&#39;s inhalation and exhalation is called breath. Between the breathing, the spleen receives this qi, circulating through the nourishing and protective energies, harmonizing yin and yang, flowing throughout the body, achieving balance. If one loses proper regulation, affected by the six excesses or the seven emotions, or due to falls, shocks, or overeating, or through exertion, it results in disharmony of internal qi, compromising the regularity of nourishing and protective energies, preventing the inhalation and exhalation that form breath, leading to pressure in the lungs, causing wheezing. Diagnosing a sliding pulse with warm extremities signifies life; a thin pulse with cold extremities indicates death, and a rapid pulse also signifies death, as it indicates a loss of form. Furthermore, there is also postpartum wheezing, which is particularly urgent, due to excessive bleeding after childbirth, leaving the nourishing blood violently depleted and the protective qi lacking control, aggregating solely in the lungs, thus causing urgent wheezing, referred to as isolated yang and extinguished yin, which is difficult to treat. The medical approach should address the causes, carefully discerning the deficiency, fullness, heat, and cold to treat accordingly. As for postpartum wheezing, it has already been documented in obstetrics, so it will not be elaborated upon again. Additionally, there can be phlegm stagnating in the gastric region, where phlegm clashes with qi, blocking the lung pathways, which also causes upper qi difficulties; this too must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Wheezing is caused by excessive heat in summer and deficiency due to winter cold. Hence, when suffering from cold, the qi is weak and the breath is shallow; when suffering from heat, the qi is strong and the breath is coarse. Cold water represents yin, which is associated with slowness; hot fire represents yang, which is associated with rapidity. Therefore, in cold conditions, the breath is slow and shallow, while in hot conditions, the breath is rapid, coarse, and results in wheezing.</p>
<p><strong>On Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>This should be understood according to classic texts: when the evil qi is excessive, it leads to fullness. Hua Tuo mentioned: when excessive, it causes wheezing; when diminished, it leads to dryness. Thus, the &quot;Living Person&quot; also states: those who wheeze have excess qi. When interpreting texts, one must grasp the underlying meaning. The idea that fullness leads to wheezing does not refer to excessive lung qi; wheezing due to excess lung qi also does not imply that the qi is actually surplus. Excess should be regarded as deficiency, and surplus should be interpreted as insufficient. If lung qi were truly excessive, and if there were surplus, it would naturally descend without causing wheezing, because fire would enter the lungs, leading to deficiency and insufficiency that result in wheezing. Therefore, stating fullness does not mean that lung qi is full; it means that the fire in the lungs is excessive. Saying there is surplus does not mean that lung qi is abundant; it refers to the excess fire in the lungs. Thus, using bitter cold remedies to purge the lungs does not actually purge the lungs, but rather purges the fire within the lungs, while genuinely nourishing lung qi. When in a calm state, the qi is harmonious; when in action, the qi causes wheezing, which pertains to the fire of the Chong meridian. The Kidney Nourishing Pill addresses this.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Asthma</strong></p>
<p>Asthma involves deficiency of qi, yin deficiency, and phlegm accumulation. </p>
<p>For prolonged asthma symptoms, when not yet manifested, the focus should be on supporting the righteous qi. If already manifested, the emphasis should be on expelling pathogens. When qi is deficient, leading to shortness of breath and wheezing, bitter and cold medicines should not be used because the heat is excessive; it is advisable to use Guo Tang with Qian Yin Tang. If phlegm is present, it can also lead to shortness of breath and wheezing. For those with yin deficiency, where heat from the lower abdomen rises and causes wheezing, one should suppress heart fire and replenish yin. For those with phlegm heat, it is necessary to clear lung heat and expel phlegm. </p>
<p>For shortness of breath and agitation, this indicates lung distension, which may lead to water retention; in such cases, inducing sweating can provide relief. If there is urgent wheezing with phlegm rising, the recipe from &quot;Da Quan&quot; with Qian Yin Tang is optimal, or Guo Tang combined with Qian Yin Tang can be used. For those with yin deficiency accompanied by phlegm and wheezing, use Si Wu Tang with Zhi Ke and Ban Xia to nourish yin and reduce fire. </p>
<p>For persistent wheezing, using a few doses of Jiao Yao can be effective. After addressing the condition, treat phlegm with phlegm remedies and fire with fire remedies. The Jiao Yao can consist of finely ground Jiao Mu mixed with a small amount of ginger decoction. Those with qi deficiency should not use this. </p>
<p>Another method: steam radish seeds as the main ingredient, using evenly burned Zao Jiao ash as powder, and making pill-sized rounds with ginger juice and honey. Taking five to seventy of these pills can help relieve the condition. </p>
<p>For those with qi deficiency, use ingredients like Ren Shen, honey-fried Huang Lian, Mai Men Dong, and Di Guo. </p>
<p>If asthma occurs due to excessive consumption of Huang Qi, use San Yao Tang to drain qi. </p>
<p>If the person is wheezing, they should use Ejiao.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p>The lungs rely on the clear yang energy that rises, residing above the five organs, connecting to the defensive and nutritive qi, harmonizing yin and yang, allowing for ascending and descending movements. Any excess or deficiency can lead to problems. Influences from external pathogens or emotional disturbances, overeating, physical activity, or disharmony in organ qi all interfere with breathing, resulting in wheezing. Those with weakness in both spleen and kidney can also experience wheezing. Additionally, improper management might lead to effects from wind, cold, heat, or dampness, causing the lung qi to swell and result in wheezing. Phlegm and qi can also lead to wheezing. </p>
<p>The treatment method must address the root cause; if affected by external pathogens, one should disperse them; if qi is stagnant, it must be regulated; for weakness in spleen and kidney, warming and regulating treatments are necessary.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Methods for Asthma</h3>
<p>Asthma must be treated with light, flavorful remedies that focus on phlegm, and it is advisable to induce a great expulsion. Medicinal ingredients should mainly include sweet flavors, avoiding cool ingredients. The medicine must often exude an exterior-dispelling quality, as this represents warmth encased in cold. There are also cases of deficiency where expulsion is not possible. One method is to use Er Chen Decoction with the addition of Atractylodes and Scutellaria to create a decoction, then administer it through Xiao Wei Dan. Treatment should be based on the evaluation of deficiency and excess.</p>
<h3>Important Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>Asthma manifests as a wheezing illness, with sounds reminiscent of a water chicken, pulling at the chest and back, causing difficulty in breathing, and restlessness in sitting or lying down. This is referred to as a cough with wheezing. If there is a long-standing root of the issue, exposure to cold can trigger it; sudden onset can also occur. In such cases, adding Mulberry Bark to cough medicine may help. Meanwhile, it’s good to take Yang Zheng Dan intermittently along with Qing Jin Dan. For wind-cold type wheezing, Jiu Bao Decoction is recommended. If there is wheezing without cough, regardless of duration, then Su Zi Jiang Qi Decoction or Shen Mi Decoction with Yang Zheng Dan should be used. In severe cases, Si Mo Drink or Liu Mo Drink with Ling Sha Dan, or Qing Meng Guan Yin Powder, and Yang Zheng Dan are particularly suitable. If asthma shows no effect from medication, draining and guiding might be necessary, ideally using Shen Bao Wan. If the stools are already loose, do not take these medicines.</p>
<p>For cases with no cough but with sudden breathlessness, there are two categories that need differentiation. If there is external evil forcing on the lungs causing breathlessness, the initial stage will present with immediate breath troubles, invariably accompanied by external signs; this is termed asthma. If depleting remedies are administered to eliminate the evil, the original qi will further diminish, leading to a more pronounced upward rush of breath; thus, one should seek remedies for breathlessness with phlegm. If there is pain between the diaphragm due to breathlessness, a differentiated drink for qi should be used.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Asthma Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In treating asthma, if there is no phlegm at the onset but phlegm is expectorated when recovery is approaching, it indicates that phlegm is blocked and inaccessible at the onset, causing severe asthma. At that time, one should open the phlegm pathways to ease the condition. Suitable treatments include single combinations like Platycodon root, Zhi Ke (bitter orange), Luo Shi Teng (trichosanthes fruit), apricot kernels, Perilla leaves, and Xuan Fu Hua (inula flower) to help expel phlegm. Once phlegm is out and asthma subsides, the treatment should adjust according to the condition of deficiency and excess. For deficiency, one can tonify with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. For excess, one should eliminate phlegm with formulas like the fragrant sinking round.</p>
<p>When asthma is triggered by cold, there are two diagnoses: the first involves both internal and external cold. The treatment includes Dongyuan’s Ginseng and Perilla Warm Lung Decoction, regulating the middle and augmenting the qi with added black currant decoction and Zijing Pill, for those who are affected by cold phlegm.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma and Distention</strong> </p>
<p>Asthma and distention share the same symptoms, both must involve difficulty in urination. Asthma must lead to distention, while distention must lead to asthma; however, one must recognize the primary and secondary conditions. When asthma occurs before distention, it is centered in the lungs; when distention occurs before asthma, it is centered in the spleen. Why is this? The lungs govern descent and, externally, control the skin and hair. The Classic states: &quot;The lungs connect with the hundred vessels, regulating the pathways of water and draining to the bladder.&quot; It also states: &quot;The bladder is the official of the metropolis, where fluids are stored; when Qi transforms, they can be released.&quot; Thus, the passage of urine is dependent on the descending Qi of the lungs for transformation and distribution. If the lungs are affected by evils and one experiences asthma, they lose the command for descent, leading to a gradual reduction in urination, causing water to overflow into the skin and result in distention. Here, asthma is primary and distention is secondary; the treatment should focus on clearing metal and lowering fire as a main approach and then promoting water as a secondary measure.</p>
<p>The spleen, associated with earth, is adverse to dampness and externally governs the muscles. Earth can control water, but if the spleen is damaged and cannot restrain water, then excess moisture runs amok, saturating the muscles. When water overflows, it inversely invades the lungs, preventing Qi from descending and causing asthma. Here, distention is primary and asthma is secondary; the treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen and promoting water as a main approach, and then clearing metal as a secondary measure. </p>
<p>If one uses drying medications for lung conditions, the metal becomes dry and asthma worsens; if one uses clearing metal medications for spleen conditions, the spleen becomes cold and distention worsens. In recent times, treatments for these two conditions focus solely on strengthening the spleen and promoting water, without distinguishing between spleen and lung conditions, hence I write to clarify this.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Distinguishing Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>Wheezing is defined as rapid breathing, while a sound in the throat is referred to as wheeze. In cases of deficiency, the patient experiences weak energy and a cool body, with cold phlegm like ice; in cases of excess, there is strong energy and a full chest, with a hot body and constipation. </p>
<p>For fire conditions, the Classics state: &quot;All rebellious surges belong to fire.&quot; In deficiency fire, it is advisable to nourish and descend the qi; in excess fire, it is necessary to clear the lungs and drain the stomach. When fire inflames the lungs and stomach, breathing may alternate between improvement and worsening, easing with food but worsening with thick phlegm. Once food enters the stomach, it can exacerbate fire and phlegm, leading to significant wheezing; thus, it is useful to reduce fire, clear metal, and guide phlegm using decoctions with herbs such as Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, Apricot kernels, and Trichosanthes. If there is excess fire in the stomach with thick phlegm in the diaphragm, Water Guiding Pills should be used. </p>
<p>Phlegm wheezing is always accompanied by a phlegm sound. For wind phlegm, use Qianqian Decoction or combine with Phlegm Guiding Decoction. For phlegm and qi, use Suzi Decoction to descend qi or Si Mo Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

However, if the fire is urgent, one should not rely solely on bitter herbs and should warm it to counteract. Use five to seven qian of powdered black pepper, taken with ginger soup.

Therefore, it is said that slight coughing indicates that the exterior has not yet resolved. If coughing with fullness is not accompanied by aversion to cold, purging will cure it. There are also cases of coughing after sweating when water is retained, or after purging leading to coughing, or cases of severe cough due to yin deficiency—these require Fan Yin Pill.

<p><strong>Treatment of Asthma</strong></p>
<p>Asthma is characterized by quick, labored breathing, loud phlegm sounds, opening of the mouth and elevation of the shoulders, and a shaking of the body and abdomen. Shortness of breath occurs when the breathing is rapid but lacks continuity; it resembles asthma but without phlegm sounds, and the shoulders are not raised, indicating that the lungs are obstructed but not descending. Wheezing is similar to asthma but does not have the same volume of airflow; instead, it produces sounds like &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;xia.&quot; The &quot;xia&quot; sound occurs with an open mouth while the &quot;ya&quot; sound happens with a closed mouth. Both sounds result in the combined character for wheezing, indicating phlegm stuck in the throat connected to the breath, which is why these sounds emerge. The three symptoms must be clearly distinguished. According to the <em>Inner Canon</em>, asthma has many causes, but fundamentally it involves upward counterflow of fire, preventing the qi from descending. There are also several causes related to deficiency; whether it arises from familial entanglements or from enemies causing harm, impacting the lung&#39;s metal qi and preventing the heavenly way from providing nourishment and clarity, all can be attributed to the blame of fire. However, while fire is singular, deficiency and excess are distinct. Danxi said: Deficient fire can be supplemented, using items like ginseng and astragalus; excess fire can be drained, using herbs like coptis and scutellaria.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Whenever I encounter worldly issues and those who suffer from wheezing, a pure condition disrupts the qi. To those who are excessive in their condition, it is rightly so, but what about those who are deficient? I have discussed this and found that nineteen died from deficiency and eleven from excess. To treat excess effectively attacks the root, presenting no difficulty. However, to treat deficiency, supplementation may not yield immediate results; it requires a long-term approach, and the process of adjusting and progressing is not easy. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish symptoms quickly, especially wheezing symptoms. The Chao and Yan families only speak of excess fire, yet Wang Haizang claims: if lung qi is truly vigorous, it should clear and descend, how could it cause wheezing? All argue that fire consumes the true qi, leading to weakness and wheezing. What is referred to as vigorous is not lung qi but the fire within the lungs. This statement surpasses ancient wisdom; regrettably, it only touches the surface and lacks thorough explanation, so let us elaborate.</p>
<p>When qi is deficient and fire enters the lungs, one must first supplement qi, using formulas like Six Gentlemen Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If fire rides on the gold element, it is vital to strengthen water, using methods like Shen Wei Di Huang Wan. For wind-cold, expel the evil with San Ao Decoction or Hua Gai Powder. For dampness, facilitate the water with Shen Shi Decoction. For summer heat, clear the vexation with Bai Hu Decoction or Xiang Ru Decoction. For lung heat, clear the upper parts with Er Dong, Er Mu, Gan, Jiao, Zhi, and Qin. For phlegm obstruction, resolve it with Er Chen Decoction. For qi stagnation, disperse it with Si Qi Decoction. For stagnation of fluids, induce vomiting, but if vomiting does not cure, employ Mu Fang Ji Decoction.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Fire is indeed the element of clarity. Baihu Decoction, supplemented with Trichosanthes fruit, bitterorange peel, and Scutellaria, is effective. For lung abscesses causing wheezing, protect the gold and transform toxins with Coix seed, licorice root, Platycodon root, fritillaria, magnolia flower, honeysuckle, tangerine peel, and asparagine. For lung distension with wheezing, promote water and disperse pathogens. Symptoms of lung distension include coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, restlessness, eyes like bulging, and a floating pulse. In such cases, use the modified Guo Bi Decoction with Pinellia. If the pulse is floating and there&#39;s water under the heart, the Xiao Qing Long Decoction plus gypsum should be administered. For kidney deficiency with fire not returning to its pathway, direct the dragon to the sea with Eight Flavor Pill as the main remedy. For kidney deficiency with water evil overflowing, expel water downward with the Jin Kui Shenqi Pill. </p>
<p>For specific wheezing patterns that may resemble but are not true wheezing, characterized by noisy breathing and persistent sounds, the root cause may be phlegm-fire stagnation internally, with wind-cold constricting externally. This may arise from sitting or lying in dampness, from excess sour and salty food, or from accumulated fire steaming upwards. With deep and longstanding roots, complete eradication is difficult. Avoid wind and cold, and moderate rich flavors. </p>
<p>Do not use cooling agents, as they may obstruct the resolution of wind evils; avoid heating agents, as they may elevate phlegm-fire.

Utilize Da Chengqi to purge the heat, so that when winter arrives, there is no heat left to contain. This is an excellent method. The aforementioned points cover the broad outlines.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>In my view, wheezing and shortness of breath are different; shortness of breath is a manifestation of deficiency, while wheezing is a manifestation of excess. However, wheezing often indicates a deficiency, and shortness of breath can sometimes indicate an excess. New illnesses may also have underlying deficiencies; one should not hold rigid opinions on this matter. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; states that true wheezing arises when the lungs are overactive and obstructed, leading to difficulty in breathing due to blocked lung passages. If the pulse feels deep and firm, one should purge the lungs. Faint wheezing, on the other hand, indicates kidney deficiency, where one first feels short of breath, accompanied by fullness in the sides, with a weak left wrist pulse—this suggests kidney tonification is necessary. This kidney deficiency is not a sign of a new illness? </p>
<p>Lastly, wheezing due to pathogenic factors arises when evils invade the lungs, becoming lodged within, blocking the passages and causing difficulty in breathing. If the pulse is superficial and tight, this implies an external invasion.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also cases in which the six organs are all subdued, and when it is necessary to disperse, the body heats up and the dyspnea subsides. This obstructive condition is difficult for people to recognize; is it not due to the excess in shortness of breath? In discussing the five organs of a person, all have upper qi, with the lungs being the master. They are situated above and form the canopy over the five organs, connecting with the defensive and nutritive qi, balancing yin and yang, allowing for ascent, descent, and movement without excess or deficiency. What illness can arise then? If invaded by wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness, the lung qi becomes distended, leading to dyspnea, rapid breathing, and restlessness in sitting and lying down. This may also arise from internal injury due to the seven emotions, causing stagnation and phlegm, or from deficiency in the spleen and stomach, which fail to nourish properly. Any phlegm in the body can cause dyspnea. </p>
<p>If one truly understands the presence of wind-cold, then use Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Qinglong Decoction. If one truly understands summer heat, then use Baihu Decoction. If one truly understands dampness, then use Shengshi Decoction. If one truly understands the stagnation of the seven emotions, then use Si Mo or Si Qi Decoction. Additionally, wood stagnation, fire stagnation, earth stagnation, metal stagnation, and water stagnation can all lead to dyspnea; the practitioner must discern these【all of the above fall under the category of excess conditions】.</p>
<p>Dongyuan says: In terms of pathological mechanisms, various kinds of atrophy, dyspnea, and vomiting all pertain to the upper body. It is further argued that those in the study of cold damage believe that dyspnea caused by fire heat indicates an excess evil present at the surface; cold transforms into heat, and excessive heart fire attacks the lungs, hence it pertains to the upper body. It is also suggested that people who indulge excessively in rich food or overly cherish their children can also accumulate heat above, leading to dyspnea, which should be treated with sweet and cooling remedies.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When diet is not regulated, and emotions or labor occur at inappropriate times, the cold and heat of food and water can harm the six viscera, all due to insufficient vital energy. Symptoms like abdominal distension, cough, wheezing, vomiting, and inability to eat should be treated with warm, sweet, and pungent remedies. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: when the lungs are overflowing, there is coughing and shortness of breath, thirst and restlessness, fullness in the chest, and shortness of breath. These arise from the fire of the ren channel moving in the chest, linked to the lower burner, not belonging to the upper. Observations from Dongyuan’s discussions show there are conditions due to excess and the evil causing illnesses, while complex illnesses arise from deficiency. This clearly distinguishes between the root and branch of disease. When encountering primary illnesses, whether through sweating, vomiting, or purging, a single remedy may expel phlegm and relieve wheezing, producing immediate results. However, practitioners must be cautious with the successful outcomes and should not indiscriminately apply these remedies to deficient symptoms, as this could be dangerous. Liu Quanshan states: all methods for expelling phlegm and stopping wheezing work effectively on those who actually have phlegm. If a patient is deficient and has a floating, large pulse that feels empty upon pressure, it is contraindicated to purge; doing so would certainly worsen the condition and could be fatal. The classics say: all wheezing belongs to the upper. They also state: all counterflow belongs to fire.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, in Hejian, the wheezing condition is due to the heat below. Hua Tuo said: &quot;When the lung qi is abundant, there is wheezing.&quot; The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: &quot;Excess qi leads to wheezing.&quot; Later compilations of herbal evidence merely follow this. Only Wang Haizang argues that when qi is abundant, it should be recognized as qi being deficient; when there is excess, it should be understood as insufficient. If lung qi is indeed abundant and excessive, then the clear and descending actions should not lead to wheezing, right? Because the fire invades the lungs, scorching the true yin, the condition of deficiency arises as wheezing. What is described as abundance and excess is not the qi of the lungs, but the fire within them. Haizang&#39;s argument surpasses those before him, revealing the profound truths of all ages. It is regrettable that it only touches upon the beginnings without tracing the source of the fire. I foolishly believe that excess fire corresponds to insufficient water; excess yang corresponds to insufficient yin. All the fiery reversals arise from the lower jiao where the heartfire is emitted from the liver and kidneys, hence they are termed &quot;reversed.&quot; When kidney water is deficient and declining, the heartfire rises too strongly, consuming the lung metal. How can there be no wheezing? Danxi said: &quot;Wheezing has its roots in yin deficiency, with fire rising from the lower abdomen. It is suitable to use the Siwu Decoction with additions of Qingdai, Zhu Li, and Chen Pi, boiled with a child&#39;s urine for consumption.&quot;<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If someone has a phlegm-ridden cough, they should take the Four Substances decoction with bitter orange and pinellia to nourish the yin and transform the phlegm. It is said that if the yin is deficient, it causes coughing, which is something that past practitioners did not realize. However, this method has led to misconceptions for future practitioners. The true deficiency lies in the essence of the kidneys; it is not simply about nourishing the blood with the Four Substances decoction. The fire that arises is from the lower burner, not something that can be suppressed by cold. Among patients, some have phlegm while others do not; the water rises with the wood and fire, and one cannot rely on bamboo sap, bitter orange, or pinellia to transform it. It is necessary to use the Six Flavor Rehmannia decoction with ophiopogon and a strong dose of five flavors to reinforce the water element, thus allowing the water to rise and the fire to descend, stabilizing the cough. This happens because the deficiency of the yin water generates fire; with fire, there is phlegm; with phlegm, there is coughing, which becomes more severe and leads to wheezing. This should be compared with the previously mentioned yin deficiency and its associated fire.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is another condition that resembles fire but is not fire, that resembles coughing but is not coughing. The classics state that the lesser yin refers to nausea, coughing, and wheezing; it occurs when the yin energy is below and the yang energy is above. When all the yang energies float without a place to settle, that is why there is wheezing.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Huangdi Needle Classic&quot; states: If the stomach channels are not in harmony, wheezing occurs due to the rebellious qi of the Yangming. The qi of Yangming is supposed to descend, but now it rises upwards, hence the wheezing. When the True Yuan is depleted, wheezing issues arise from the kidney qi surging upwards. Such a person may not appear ill on ordinary days but feels short of breath, which is not actually true wheezing but qi that does not return to its origin. </p>
<p>Observing the external symptoms, the limbs are cold, the face is red, and there is irritability and aversion to heat, though it seems like fire, it is actually the fire of the True Yuan of the Mingmen, having left its palace without returning. Examining the pulse, though it feels large and rapid at the two-inch mark, at the two-foot mark it is weak and may feel present but is actually absent. Those who do not understand might think there is heat and use cooling herbs to clear it; thinking that the wheezing is urgent, they might assist with herbs like Si Mo to alleviate it. After swallowing, there seems to be slight improvement, but after a moment, it remains the same. </p>
<p>Little do they know that easing it by a little further depletes it even more. Indeed, seeing slight improvement, they mistakenly believe the medicine’s effect is insufficient and double the intake of cool, qi-promoting agents, immediately witnessing fatal results. Why is this? It is because when yin is deficient leading to wheezing, death is not far away. Fortunately, there is a thread of hope, tethered at the root of the Mingmen, lingering just a bit longer.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

<p>The disease of breathlessness is the most critical condition; if not treated correctly, it is rarely without consequence. To distinguish it, there are essentially two types. The first type is termed &quot;true breathlessness,&quot; and the second type is &quot;false breathlessness.&quot; These two types are opposites and should not be confused. </p>
<p>So how do we distinguish between them? True breathlessness is characterized by the presence of an external pathogen, while false breathlessness results from an absence of such a pathogen, relying instead on a deficiency of vital energy. In true breathlessness, the breath is prolonged and abundant; in false breathlessness, the breath is short and unsteady. </p>
<p>In true breathlessness, the chest feels swollen and the breath is coarse, the sound is loud and the panting is forceful, creating a sensation of fullness that can only be relieved by exhaling; in false breathlessness, the breath is quick and weak, the sound is low and the inhalation is short, creating a feeling of urgency as if the breath is about to stop, rising as if it cannot ascend, and swallowing as if it cannot connect, worsening with exertion and appearing hurriedly panting, only finding slight relief by extending a single breath.</p>
<p>Thus, one form is true breathlessness, and the other is mimic breathlessness. True breathlessness is attributed to the lungs, while mimic breathlessness is attributed to the kidneys.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is it? The lung is the master of qi, and the kidney is the root of qi. The lung governs the skin and hair and is located in the upper jiao. Thus, when pathogenic factors invade, qi in the upper jiao becomes congested, leading to wheezing. When qi is obstructed, it should be cleared and dispersed. The kidney governs essence and is located in the lower jiao. If true yin is deficient and essence cannot transform into qi, then there is an obstruction in the upward exchange, resulting in shortness of breath. Shortness of breath is the basis for distress. When qi is already short and further dissipated, it is like pressing on an egg. Moreover, when qi is abundant, the pulse will be slippery, rapid, and strong; whereas when qi is deficient with no pathogenic factors, the pulse will be weak and lacking spirit. This illustrates the difference in pulse conditions. If one sees a floating and surging pulse, or a greatly wide pulse that disappears with slight pressure, this indicates a pulse with no foundation. If the pulse fluctuates strongly and is exceedingly large and rapid, yet is entirely lacking in harmony, it signals a defeat of the stomach qi, both representing significant deficiency. However, the weakness of the pulse is easily recognized as true deficiency, while a floating and hollow pulse can be difficult to distinguish between true and false fullness. Nevertheless, the distinction in intensity can be observed here. The weak pulse is still manageable and easily treated, while the floating hollow pulse is the most perilous and variable. If the string-like pulse is excessively strong, it indicates a palpable disturbance in the zang organs and is not to be treated.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<p>All cases of wheezing are fundamentally due to qi deficiency. Among those with qi deficiency-induced wheezing, seven or eight out of ten show no external wind pathogens and no internal heat, indicating they are cases of weak wheezing. If the deficiency is in the spleen and lungs, it is confined to the upper jiao, where the transformation source is not yet depleted, making the condition relatively mild. However, if the deficiency is in the liver and kidneys, the illness arises from the lower jiao, affecting both root and branch, making the condition more severe. It is crucial to promptly address the root to support the true qi, thus allowing for recovery. In instances where the illness is prolonged and accompanied by worsening wheezing, or if chronic use of phlegm-resolving and qi-dispersing medications exacerbates the wheezing, or if there is wheezing above and diarrhea below, or if a woman experiences excessive blood loss after childbirth leading to a severe deficiency of nutritive qi, where the solitary yang is unsupported causing wheezing, this is termed the state of solitary yang devoid of yin, a condition of extreme depletion, which becomes difficult to treat.

If both the renying and cunkou pulses are strong at four times above normal, it confirms the condition of guan ge. This diagnosis is based on the pulse rather than the illness itself. Currently, there are many individuals suffering from this condition, yet many remain unaware. Furthermore, recent practitioners of pulse diagnosis tend to focus exclusively on the cunkou pulse, disregarding the renying. If the pulses in both hands are excessively strong—floating and string-like to an extreme, four times or more—this indicates such a condition. The patient often experiences a restless, uneasy breathlessness, which is characterized by a feeling of pressure in the chest that can seem like swelling but is not truly swollen. The breath may feel short yet is not truly so, and even slight exertion or speaking can exacerbate the breathlessness. There may also be tremors throughout the body, along with feelings of anxiety and unrest. This condition is primarily due to emotional disturbances harming the yin, leading to a lack of foundational vital energy, resulting in a situation where the solitary yang is separated and chaotic.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is also a discussion on phlegm and wheezing. Previous experts all stated to treat phlegm, not knowing that phlegm cannot wheeze by itself, and that there must be a cause for the production of phlegm. Therefore, one should seek the root cause and treat it. Generally, when one is invaded by wind and cold from the outside, with obstruction in the lungs leading to cough and wheezing, one should use Liu&#39;an Decoction with a supplement of fine root or perilla leaves. If the invasion of wind and cold is severe in winter, one can add ephedra to the original formula, or use Xiao Qing Long Decoction, Hua Gai Powder, or San Ao Decoction types to address it. For cases with external wind and cold coupled with slight internal heat causing wheezing, Huang Qin Ban Xia Decoction should be used. If there is a combination of excessive Yangming fire and heat wrapped in cold, one should use cooling yet dispersing methods, such as Da Qing Long Decoction or Wu Hu Decoction, or Zhao Bi with Ban Xia Decoction types. If there is no external wind or cold, but only excessive fire causing wheezing, or even if there is slight cold but the emphasis is on fire, one should use Sang Bai Pi Decoction or Chou Xin Drink types to address it.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When phlegm is abundant and causes wheezing, it is appropriate to treat the phlegm with formulas such as Erchen Decoction, Liu’an Decoction, Daotan Decoction, Qianqin Decoction, Gunphlegm Pill, or Baolong Pill, all of which can address wheezing caused by excessive phlegm. Formulas like Liu Jun Zi Decoction and Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction can treat wheezing due to deficient phlegm. However, phlegm itself is merely a symptom of an underlying condition, so there must be a source causing the phlegm. Therefore, if phlegm arises from heat, the heat must be treated first; if from cold, the cold must be expelled first. Additionally, phlegm can also be generated from repressed qi, wind pathogens, damp stagnation, or weakness in the spleen and kidneys. If any of these factors contribute, they can lead to phlegm formation. If one attempts to treat phlegm without addressing its root cause, then the phlegm will never be resolved, and the wheezing cannot be cured. </p>
<p>If the qi level is affected by pathogens, and there is excess qi in the upper jiao causing wheezing, or if emotional stress has caused liver injury, a robust person exhibiting fullness and a strong pulse can simply relieve the qi to self-recover from wheezing. In such cases, formulas like Kuaqing Yin, Sìchuāng Yin, Sìqī Decoction, Radish Seed Decoction, or Suzi Jiangqi Decoction are suitable. If there is stagnated qi in the Yangming channel leading to fullness, a mild purgative may be beneficial.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Asthma</strong></p>
<p>Asthma has its deep-rooted origins, and can be triggered by cold or exertion; it is also referred to as wheezing and asthma. When it is not manifesting, one should primarily focus on reinforcing the vital energy; when it does manifest, the main focus should be on eliminating the pathogenic factors. To reinforce the vital energy, one must differentiate between yin and yang. If there is deficiency, one should tonify yin; if there is yang deficiency, one should tonify yang. To eliminate pathogenic factors, one must assess the severity; one may need to dispel wind, warm cold, or clear phlegm and heat. However, in chronic cases, the vital energy is invariably deficient, so during the process of dispelling, it is advisable to cautiously add warmth and tonification, or to appropriately increase the dispersing methods within the tonification. In such instances, one should always focus on nourishing the original qi, ensuring that it gradually fills up, for this gives hope for gradual recovery. If one excessively attacks, there has never been a case where it does not lead to worsening and danger.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Wheezing</strong></p>
<p>For urgent treatment, one must not delay even for a moment. When a person suddenly catches a wind-imbalance, and cold enters the lung meridian, it can lead to immediate wheezing, raised shoulders, labored breathing, and difficulty in expelling phlegm, making it impossible to lie down. The prescription includes one cash each of Chai Hu, Dang Gui, Huang Qin, Gan Cao, Ban Xia, and She Gan, and two cash each of Jie Geng, Mai Dong, and Fu Ling, to be decocted and taken. This formula excels in using Chai Hu, She Gan, and Jie Geng to disseminate and release the lung&#39;s vital energy, employing Ban Xia to eliminate phlegm, and using Huang Qin to clear heat. When one is externally invaded by cold, it must internally transform into a heat syndrome; thus, Huang Qin is used for its cleansing and resolving properties. However, using only Huang Qin, while it is said to clear heat, may inadvertently suppress the fire energy. The brilliance lies in the combination of Jie Geng, She Gan, and Chai Hu, which are warming and dispersive, effectively extinguishing fire and eliminating the pathogen. This is one method for urgent treatment.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person experiences breathlessness and cannot lie down, and their phlegm flows out like a spring, yet their tongue is not dry and the breathlessness is not severe, lying down exacerbates the condition. This is not due to external causative wind but rather the cold energy within the kidneys. When there is no fire in the kidneys, the water has nothing to nourish it, rising up and causing phlegm. The water in the stomach then assists this surging force and cannot be stopped. The proper treatment is to use the Six Flavor Pill Decoction with the addition of a large dose of aconite and cinnamon, which will heat the kidney palace, allowing the water to return. Once the water returns to the palace, the breathlessness will subside and the person can lie down peacefully. For a person to sleep, the kidney energy and lung energy must interact; only then can the pathway be smooth and free from chaos. In the prescription, nourishing kidney fire allows for peaceful sleep. It is important to note that the kidney is the mother of the lung; when the child is at peace, the mother is also tranquil. The lung&#39;s metallic energy can return to the kidney palace to nourish its dissipating energy. Hence, nourishing kidney fire is truly a means to also nourish the lung&#39;s metal.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

It balances water and fire, providing stability to the lung&#39;s metal element; when the lungs and kidneys are harmonized, is there anyone who cannot sleep soundly yet feels very comfortable?</p>
<p>There are different types of wheezing; some are due to deficiency, while others are due to excess. For excess wheezing, if the symptoms appear heavy and are less pronounced, use two qian of Huang Qin, three qian of Mai Dong, five fen of Gan Cao, and one qian each of Chai Hu, Su Ye, Shan Dou Gen, Ban Xia, and Wu Yao. Decoction in water and consume; one dose will stop the wheezing, and no further doses are necessary. However, in cases of wheezing due to excess, the breath is often rapid, the throat makes noise, and the shoulders lift—unlike deficient wheezing, which is less urgent, with a silent throat and relaxed shoulders. Deficient wheezing indicates significant kidney deficiency, with the spleen’s energy on the verge of collapse, hence the urgent upward surges that struggle to break through but have not yet done so.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The formula to alleviate severe breathlessness contains the following ingredients: one tael each of ginseng and prepared rehmannia, three qian each of shan zhu yu and white mustard seed, five qian of ophiopogon, one qian each of schisandra and achyranthes. Brew with water and take. One dose may provide slight relief, two doses can stop wheezing, and ten doses can lead to full recovery. This condition is indeed a sign of imminent death; fortunately, a faint breath lingers in the upper and lower realms. If cool medicines are used to balance the fire, it hastens their demise. Similarly, using cinnamon and aconite to supplement the fire will also accelerate the end. When the vital energy approaches extinction, it should be gently supported, not urgently restored, just like a dying fire that still has a few embers—kindling it with firewood is advisable. If one abruptly throws sulfur or similar substances onto it, the fire will be extinguished. Moreover, using cold and cool substances to stir it leads to a rare chance of renewal. The brilliance of this formula lies in its combination of kidney and lung tonics. When used together with ginseng, it directly penetrates the very essence of yin, giving rise to kidney energy, which in turn generates lung energy, thus sustaining life in the realm of nothingness. Furthermore, ginseng nourishes the lungs to support the kidneys, promoting a mutual generation that can truly save one from death.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zi Jin Dan (The Purple Gold Pill)</strong></p>
<p><strong>From &quot;Entering the Door&quot;:</strong> For asthma that does not allow lying down, it can only be taken after three years. </p>
<ul>
<li>1 qian of arsenic powder  </li>
<li>1 liang of crushed plain fermented soybeans  </li>
<li>4 liang of finely chopped fresh pig&#39;s blood</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix these three ingredients, divide into three portions, wrap each portion in paper and clay, dry it in the oven until the clay is dry. Then, use charcoal fire to roast until the blue smoke is completely exhausted. Leave it on the ground overnight to expel the toxic smoke, then ground into powder. Soak in water to form dough, and make small pills the size of mung beans. After eating, wash down with cool tea. For adults, take 20 pills; for children, 7 pills. Avoid all salty foods and soups.</p>
<p><strong>From &quot;Returning to Spring&quot;:</strong> Whenever the weather threatens to rain, you may experience coughing and wheezing, making sitting or lying down uncomfortable, and loss of appetite. This indicates that there is cold phlegm accumulated in the lung orifices, which invades through the mouth and nose with the cold air from overcast weather, causing the lungs to expand with sound. This condition can cause lifelong suffering, and it may also be hereditary. Each episode should be treated promptly; after seven or eight instances, if the phlegm is foul-smelling and you expel white phlegm, this will eradicate the root of the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 qian of white arsenic, to be ground anew  </li>
<li>3 qian of burnt alum, to be ground anew  </li>
<li>1 liang of plain fermented soybeans, soaked in water, peeled, steamed, and ground into paste</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix the above powders, roll into pills the size of mung beans. Take 5 pills with cool tea; for severe cases, take 9 pills. The aim is to stop wheezing to be considered cured, and there is no need to take more. Long-term use will surely yield results.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Xiao Ying Jian</strong>: This formula treats deficiency of the blood and yin leading to wheezing. It has a neutral nature and flavor. Ingredients: 2 qian each of Angelica, Peony, and Fried Dioscorea, 2-3 qian of Cooked Rehmannia, 1 qian of Honey-fried Licorice, 2 sheng of water, decoct to 7 parts, take warm after a meal.</p>
<p><strong>Zhen Yuan Yin</strong>: This formula treats shortness of breath that resembles wheezing, with rapid and hurried breathing, difficulty in raising oneself, inability to swallow, and obstruction of the airways, especially in critical situations. People commonly misinterpret this as merely breathlessness; however, the root cause lies in the extreme deficiency of the Liver and Kidney. This is caused by the failure of the body’s essential forces to interact, resulting in qi collapse. It is particularly prevalent among women with constant blood deficiency. This formula should be used urgently for recovery—it&#39;s truly an extraordinary remedy. When diagnosing this condition, the pulse is surely weak and without vitality. If weak and simultaneously tense, the situation is even more serious.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the lung has long suffered from cold pathogens, the initial onset of wheezing will feel as if cold rises from the back, cold like ice and frost, gradually leading to urgent breathing, with no continuity of breath. Phlegm and saliva become obstructed, and one cannot expel them; sitting or lying down becomes impossible, leaving one unable to find relief. The shoulders rise and stiffen, the back curves, and the eyes strain, feeling exhausted as if wanting to die. It is advisable to take medicine. If the first dose is ineffective, taking it again will surely cure the condition, with results akin to magic.</p>
<p>The preparation should be made with a pound of crucian carp, without removing the scales or intestines, but making an opening near the head region. Place a small amount of mineral substance inside, ensuring it goes deep. Then, put the fish in a bamboo tube, coating the outside with a mixture of mugwort and salt to seal it. Heat the bamboo tube until it glows red, then allow it to cool, removing the mud to extract the fish. Simply grind this, not burning it, then mix in three taels of clam powder, grind until well combined, and form into pills the size of a mung bean. Coat them with vermilion.</p>
<p>Take three to five pills at bedtime, washed down with cold sugar water. Avoid hot substances. This remedy is suitable when experiencing acute wheezing; do not exceed the recommended number of pills. If you wish to test this medicine, take a pig&#39;s lung and inflate it, placing a few pills inside the lung, and shortly thereafter, it will gradually weaken, demonstrating its efficacy.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Conducting Filial Piety,&quot; it states: A man experienced wheezing and fullness in his chest and abdomen, often making sounds, unable to freely exhale or inhale. Initially, he was treated with the &quot;Dusheng Powder,&quot; which induced vomiting. After vomiting, he was given &quot;Daoshui Wan&quot; and &quot;Yugong San,&quot; with a mild purging of three to four bowel movements. When there was no improvement, he was given &quot;Lige Wan&quot; to purge further, ensuring the upper and lower parts were unblocked. Afterward, he took &quot;Pingwei San,&quot; &quot;Wuling San,&quot; and &quot;Sanhe San,&quot; using medicine to regulate the yin and yang and promote water passage, which ultimately led to recovery.</p>
<p>In &quot;Danxi&#39;s Heart Method,&quot; it mentions: I treated a woman over fifty years old who had a history of phlegm cough. Suddenly one day, she experienced severe wheezing, with phlegm coming out like a spring, sweating heavily, and her pulse was floating and surging, resembling a life-threatening condition. Being present at that time, I quickly used four qian of Ophiopogon, two qian of ginseng, and one qian and five fen of Schisandra, boiling them into a decoction for her to take. The wheezing settled, and the sweating stopped; after three doses, the phlegm gradually decreased. I then provided the previous formula, adding one qian and five fen of Trichosanthes fruit, and one qian each of Baiyuan, Angelica, Peony, and Scutellaria. After over twenty doses, she was stable. This was indeed due to the effects of Ophiopogon, Schisandra, and ginseng. If there were symptoms of spontaneous sweating along with abdominal fullness and a firm pulse, it indicates internal excess, and purging would be appropriate.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

Her bowel movements were slow, with a bounding pulse that was twice the normal rate, while the Guan pulse was deep, slow, and powerful. I considered the dampness from the misty rain and the heat from her food, noting that the excess damp heat ascended to the lungs, causing chaotic energy, thus leading to breathlessness and fullness. When the evil qi is strong, it tends to be solid, and solid conditions should be treated with purgation. Therefore, I prepared Ping Qi San to purify and reduce it. After one dose, her condition improved by half, and after a second dose, her wheezing resolved, though she still had discomfort in the chest and stomach, feelings of heat and dryness in the mouth, and occasional coughing, which I treated with a modified Xie Bai San.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

His left side was swollen like an overturned cup, his abdomen was distended like a drum, and he displayed many blue veins. He experienced shortness of breath and could not lie down. During the summer rains, he took laxatives to relieve his condition, and in the afternoon he felt feverish, while at night he had night sweats, prompting him to urgently seek help. I went to examine him, and found his pulse to be floating and rapid, with no strength upon pressure. I told the sick man: &quot;In treating accumulation, one should not strike at it with toxic medications.&quot; As stated in the &quot;Medical Compendium,&quot; there was once a military man captured by bandits, placed in a boat beneath the planks, and after several days he managed to escape. They gorged themselves when hungry, but after a long time, when they removed their clothes to scratch themselves for lice, the next day they fell ill with wind-cold, resulting in spontaneous sweating and difficulty in digestion. One doctor diagnosed it as food stagnation and prescribed purgatives, while another attributed it to exposure after removing clothing, treating it with sweating therapies. After several mixed treatments, the patient gradually felt more dazed and fatigued, and his breath became laborious. Upon diagnosis, I concluded it was a mild case of exterior syndrome with slight wheezing, and prescribed the Gui Zhi and Hou Po Xing Ren decoction, which is the method of Zhang Zhongjing. I instructed the physician to hastily administer the medicine; after one sip, his wheezing subsided, with another sip causing profuse sweating. By evening, his body was cool, and his pulse had stabilized. The physician remarked: &quot;In my lifetime, I have never used Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s formula, and I did not know it was so effective.&quot;<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It should not be done. Now that the pulse is weak like this, how can we dare to treat it with ordinary methods? Therefore, we administered a formula to promote digestion and nutrition, and after a few doses, the bowel movements regulated themselves. By balancing the energies of yin and yang, and moderating food intake, the abdomen noticeably reduced, and the stomach&#39;s energy became slightly stable. We interspersed this treatment with lighter remedies, and in just under a month, there was significant improvement. My former teacher once said: &quot;The ancient sage Jiagu said: Nourishing the right will naturally lead to elimination of excess.&quot; Just like a gathering full of gentlemen, even with one lone scoundrel among them, there is no way he could thrive. Now, if we strengthen the true energy and the stomach&#39;s vitality, the excess will naturally be resolved. The words of Jiagu cannot be misleading! The texts say: &quot;When there is a great accumulation, consume most of it and then stop.&quot; Even when the center is full of accumulated energy, one must not overuse potent remedies; how much more so should we be cautious when there is accumulation in a weakened state? This is also a method for treating accumulation. It is essential to carefully discern between what is pathogenic and what is righteous, between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

Both physicians insisted that the pulse was strong and the qi abundant, indicating the need for purging. After my examination, I explained that this was a strong pulse of heat, not a true fullness. Observing his shortness of breath, which was not sufficient for rest, I determined to apply a treatment for deficiency. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, and included three fen of Fu Zi. After decocting and administering two doses, the pulse began to constrict.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The daughter of my friend Song Jingfu suffered from a deficiency of vital energy, having little appetite and feeling weak. At the beginning of spring, she suddenly experienced severe shortness of breath, losing consciousness and feeling cold in her hands and feet. Many believed she would die instantly. I said that her vital energy was extremely weak and the metal element (lung energy) was not clear and purifying, which impeded downward movement. Without a powerful warming tonic, there was no hope for recovery. I then administered one tael of ginseng, three qian of dried ginger, three qian of prepared aconite, and five qian of white atractylodes; after one dosage, she revived. Later, she took over seven jins of ginseng, and two jins each of ginger and aconite, and was completely cured without recurrence.</p>
<p>Another friend&#39;s daughter, Sun Fang, had a long-standing cough and wheezing. She had tried numerous remedies aimed at regulating qi, transforming phlegm, clearing heat, and descending fire, but none were effective. One day, when her wheezing became particularly severe and she felt very irritable, I examined her eyes, which were bulging; her nose, which was flaring; and her pulse, which was floating and large, indicating clear lung congestion. I then prescribed a modified Ban Xia Hou Po Tang, and after one dose, her condition improved; after a second dose, she recovered. I remarked that although she had recovered, it was still unreliable. She needed to use ginseng and atractylodes to replenish her essentials, nourish the metal energy, making the channels clear and functional. However, she neglected to regulate and nourish herself for about a month, and her condition recurred, becoming irreparable.</p>
<p>Literary figure Gu Minghua had suffered from a cough for ten years, trying hundreds of medicines to no avail. Upon examining his pulse, I found it thin and weak. I stated that the weakness was due to phlegm, fire, wind, and cold, having lingered for a long time and become deeply rooted. He needed to nourish his body for a month and utilize methods of purging and downward movement. In six months, after purging and downing ten times, and taking over a hundred herbal tonics, he was cured. Moreover, I advised him to take a tonic for replenishing Qi in the form of medicinal pills, adding quail eggs and autumn stones, which he took for over a year without relapse.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: In Liyang, a young boy of Hong Ji suffered from phlegm and wheezing, not nursing or eating for five days and nights. The doctor warned of a critical condition. His wife dreamed of Guanyin, who instructed her to give him a ginseng and walnut soup. Hong Ji quickly procured a small piece of Korean ginseng and one walnut kernel, boiling them into a soup and administering it; the wheezing stopped immediately. The next day, he used the soup after removing the walnut skin, but the wheezing returned. He then used it with the skin on, and after a night, he recovered. This formula is not recorded in books. It is believed that ginseng helps relieve wheezing, and the walnut skin can consolidate the lungs.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: There was a sturdy military man who usually did not have a lot of appetite and did not enjoy hot food; he experienced shortness of breath when walking, claiming he had a buildup of old phlegm. He took a medicine called Beiji Wan to address it, but his pulse was rapid and strong with no presence when pressed deeply. I thought his Mingmen fire was weakened, and he had deficiency and cold in the spleen and lungs. I combined it with Ba Wei Wan, which slightly alleviated the phlegm and wheezing. After several doses, the symptoms completely stopped, allowing him to enjoy hot drinks and food. This Beiji Wan, thought to be made by people from the Western Regions, is said to be effective because their environment is harsh, and their people do not wear protective clothing, making their bodies resilient against illness. Diseases arise from within, and thus should be treated with potent medications. From this perspective, it seems that it cannot be used indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The physician Lu Yizhai, who had little appetite, suddenly experienced phlegm obstructing his breathing, with his head shaking and eyes blinking, and he could not check his pulse properly. Observing his complexion, yellow with a hint of green, indicated that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen earth, resembling a child&#39;s chronic fright syndrome. First, he used Liu Jun, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma to calm him, followed by a Baizhong Yiqi addition with Ban Xia, leading to a full recovery.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

(Note: The lungs govern the qi of the whole body, while the kidneys are the source of vital essence.) Discussions on Regulating Menstruation When qi is excessive, there will be wheezing and cough with ascending qi. (Note: The lungs govern qi and control breathing, hence when excessive, they cause wheezing and cough with upward reversal.) Yin and Yang Distinction Discussion When yin struggles within and yang disturbs externally, if the corporeal soul's sweat is not contained, it rises and causes trouble, which in turn aggravates the lungs and leads to wheezing. (Note: The corporeal soul's sweat pertains to the lungs. The vital essence returns to the lungs, which connect to the hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin. If the skin sweats while the essence and blood remain stored in yin, then if the corporeal soul's sweat is not contained, it drains and harms the essence and blood. If the yin fluids of the lungs leak outward, then the yins of the four organs also rise, creating upward disturbance in the lungs, causing rapid wheezing and hoarse voice.) Diseases of the dual yang affect the heart and spleen, which cannot hide the curves; if women do not have their monthly cycle, it transmits as wind disappearance. If it transmits as hiccup, it leads to death without treatment. (Note: The dual yang refers to the Yangming stomach.

When it rises, the pathogens reside between the organs, resulting in water accumulation. **Note: \"Yin energy descends and then rises\" refers to the winter solstice when Yang is first born, and the Yin energy descends, rising again in May. The Yin energy returns to the water organs, and when the rising Yin energy becomes stronger, water pathogens ascend with the Qi, thereby occupying the organs, leading to wheezing and water retention.** In the Shaoyin context, \"vomiting, coughing, and wheezing\" occur because the Yin energy is below and the Yang energy is above; all the Yang energies rise without a foundation to rely on, thus causing vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. **Note: The cold water of Shaoyin is below, while the fire energy is above. When water and fire do not interact, the Yang energy rises and floats without support, leading to the upward reversal of Yang heat, which manifests as vomiting, cough, and wheezing.** **On Reversal** With Yangming Qi reversal, there is wheezing and coughing, body heat, anxiety, epistaxis, and vomiting blood. **Note: The Qi reversal of Yangming leads to wheezing, and its upward movement causes coughing.** **On Demonstrating Composure** Wheezing and coughing are the result of water Qi combined with Yangming. **Note: Wheezing and coughing occur due to the water Qi of the lower jiao combined with the Yangming channel.**"},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**The Theory of Excess Heat Affecting the Body** Due to heat, one sweats and feels restless, leading to panting and drinking.

The lungs are the cover of the heart, so when troubled, one pants and drinks. If not troubled and calm, this evil still resides in the qi division, causing harm to the spirit. When qi is deficient, one speaks excessively. The yang evil of heaven injures one's yang energy, and these two types of yang clash, causing the body to feel like burning coals. The evil of yang heat releases because of the yin fluids in the body, thus leading to sweating and dispersal. Excessive sweetness leads to heart qi being full, causing dark coloration and imbalance in kidney qi. **Note**: Excessive sweetness solidifies the earth qi; when the earth is solid, the heart qi cannot transmit to the child (descendants), hence the fullness and panting. The kidneys govern water, which is black in color; excessive earth damages the kidneys, resulting in dark coloration and imbalance in kidney qi. **The Large Theory of Yin and Yang Manifestations** When yang prevails, the body feels hot, pores are closed, and panting is coarse. This causes a need to bend or look up; sweating does not occur, yet there is heat, and teeth feel dry. It leads to restlessness, abdominal fullness, and a sense of impending death—able to endure winter, but not summer. **Note**: The predominance of yang leads to the stress of fire and heat, thus causing body heat. When heat is on the surface, the pores are closed; when internal, it leads to coarse panting. When yin prevails in the abdomen, one bends down; when yang prevails in the back, one looks up.

If the qi is deficient and reversely ascends, then blood follows and rises; if the qi retreats downward, one hears the sounds of moans associated with illness.

The heart governs the pulse; hence obstruction causes the pulse to be unresponsive. The pathogens disturb the area below the heart, affecting the heart itself, resulting in restlessness and the distended sensation below the heart. The lungs cover the heart, and as the heart's pulse extends to the lungs, reversed energy surges upward, causing panting. Intestinal obstruction involves frequent drinking without relief, internal energy contends, and occasional diarrhea occurs. Intestinal obstruction refers to both the small and large intestines. The small intestine, being a subordinate of the heart, governs urination; obstruction affecting the small intestine leads to heat accumulation above causing frequent drinking, while below it results in retention of urination.

The classic states: when qi rises to the chest, one cannot stand for long due to wheezing; the illness pertains to the large intestine, as the large intestine is the organ coupled with the lungs.

Thus, a person's inhalation and exhalation is called breath. Between the breathing, the spleen receives this qi, circulating through the nourishing and protective energies, harmonizing yin and yang, flowing throughout the body, achieving balance. If one loses proper regulation, affected by the six excesses or the seven emotions, or due to falls, shocks, or overeating, or through exertion, it results in disharmony of internal qi, compromising the regularity of nourishing and protective energies, preventing the inhalation and exhalation that form breath, leading to pressure in the lungs, causing wheezing. Diagnosing a sliding pulse with warm extremities signifies life; a thin pulse with cold extremities indicates death, and a rapid pulse also signifies death, as it indicates a loss of form. Furthermore, there is also postpartum wheezing, which is particularly urgent, due to excessive bleeding after childbirth, leaving the nourishing blood violently depleted and the protective qi lacking control, aggregating solely in the lungs, thus causing urgent wheezing, referred to as isolated yang and extinguished yin, which is difficult to treat. The medical approach should address the causes, carefully discerning the deficiency, fullness, heat, and cold to treat accordingly. As for postpartum wheezing, it has already been documented in obstetrics, so it will not be elaborated upon again.

Hence, when suffering from cold, the qi is weak and the breath is shallow; when suffering from heat, the qi is strong and the breath is coarse. Cold water represents yin, which is associated with slowness; hot fire represents yang, which is associated with rapidity. Therefore, in cold conditions, the breath is slow and shallow, while in hot conditions, the breath is rapid, coarse, and results in wheezing. **On Wheezing** This should be understood according to classic texts: when the evil qi is excessive, it leads to fullness. Hua Tuo mentioned: when excessive, it causes wheezing; when diminished, it leads to dryness. Thus, the \"Living Person\" also states: those who wheeze have excess qi. When interpreting texts, one must grasp the underlying meaning. The idea that fullness leads to wheezing does not refer to excessive lung qi; wheezing due to excess lung qi also does not imply that the qi is actually surplus. Excess should be regarded as deficiency, and surplus should be interpreted as insufficient. If lung qi were truly excessive, and if there were surplus, it would naturally descend without causing wheezing, because fire would enter the lungs, leading to deficiency and insufficiency that result in wheezing. Therefore, stating fullness does not mean that lung qi is full; it means that the fire in the lungs is excessive. Saying there is surplus does not mean that lung qi is abundant; it refers to the excess fire in the lungs. Thus, using bitter cold remedies to purge the lungs does not actually purge the lungs, but rather purges the fire within the lungs, while genuinely nourishing lung qi.

This is referred to as a cough with wheezing. If there is a long-standing root of the issue, exposure to cold can trigger it; sudden onset can also occur.

In severe cases, Si Mo Drink or Liu Mo Drink with Ling Sha Dan, or Qing Meng Guan Yin Powder, and Yang Zheng Dan are particularly suitable. If asthma shows no effect from medication, draining and guiding might be necessary, ideally using Shen Bao Wan. If the stools are already loose, do not take these medicines. For cases with no cough but with sudden breathlessness, there are two categories that need differentiation. If there is external evil forcing on the lungs causing breathlessness, the initial stage will present with immediate breath troubles, invariably accompanied by external signs; this is termed asthma. If depleting remedies are administered to eliminate the evil, the original qi will further diminish, leading to a more pronounced upward rush of breath; thus, one should seek remedies for breathlessness with phlegm.

Suitable treatments include single combinations like Platycodon root, Zhi Ke (bitter orange), Luo Shi Teng (trichosanthes fruit), apricot kernels, Perilla leaves, and Xuan Fu Hua (inula flower) to help expel phlegm. Once phlegm is out and asthma subsides, the treatment should adjust according to the condition of deficiency and excess. For deficiency, one can tonify with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. For excess, one should eliminate phlegm with formulas like the fragrant sinking round. When asthma is triggered by cold, there are two diagnoses: the first involves both internal and external cold.

Asthma must lead to distention, while distention must lead to asthma; however, one must recognize the primary and secondary conditions. When asthma occurs before distention, it is centered in the lungs; when distention occurs before asthma, it is centered in the spleen. Why is this? The lungs govern descent and, externally, control the skin and hair. The Classic states: \"The lungs connect with the hundred vessels, regulating the pathways of water and draining to the bladder.\" It also states: \"The bladder is the official of the metropolis, where fluids are stored; when Qi transforms, they can be released.\" Thus, the passage of urine is dependent on the descending Qi of the lungs for transformation and distribution. If the lungs are affected by evils and one experiences asthma, they lose the command for descent, leading to a gradual reduction in urination, causing water to overflow into the skin and result in distention. Here, asthma is primary and distention is secondary; the treatment should focus on clearing metal and lowering fire as a main approach and then promoting water as a secondary measure. The spleen, associated with earth, is adverse to dampness and externally governs the muscles. Earth can control water, but if the spleen is damaged and cannot restrain water, then excess moisture runs amok, saturating the muscles. When water overflows, it inversely invades the lungs, preventing Qi from descending and causing asthma. Here, distention is primary and asthma is secondary; the treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen and promoting water as a main approach, and then clearing metal as a secondary measure. If one uses drying medications for lung conditions, the metal becomes dry and asthma worsens; if one uses clearing metal medications for spleen conditions, the spleen becomes cold and distention worsens.

Wheezing is similar to asthma but does not have the same volume of airflow; instead, it produces sounds like \"ya\" and \"xia.\" The \"xia\" sound occurs with an open mouth while the \"ya\" sound happens with a closed mouth. Both sounds result in the combined character for wheezing, indicating phlegm stuck in the throat connected to the breath, which is why these sounds emerge.

There are also several causes related to deficiency; whether it arises from familial entanglements or from enemies causing harm, impacting the lung's metal qi and preventing the heavenly way from providing nourishment and clarity, all can be attributed to the blame of fire.

However, to treat deficiency, supplementation may not yield immediate results; it requires a long-term approach, and the process of adjusting and progressing is not easy. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish symptoms quickly, especially wheezing symptoms.

All argue that fire consumes the true qi, leading to weakness and wheezing. What is referred to as vigorous is not lung qi but the fire within the lungs. This statement surpasses ancient wisdom; regrettably, it only touches the surface and lacks thorough explanation, so let us elaborate. When qi is deficient and fire enters the lungs, one must first supplement qi, using formulas like Six Gentlemen Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction.

Avoid wind and cold, and moderate rich flavors. Do not use cooling agents, as they may obstruct the resolution of wind evils; avoid heating agents, as they may elevate phlegm-fire.

If the pulse feels deep and firm, one should purge the lungs. Faint wheezing, on the other hand, indicates kidney deficiency, where one first feels short of breath, accompanied by fullness in the sides, with a weak left wrist pulse—this suggests kidney tonification is necessary.

Only Wang Haizang argues that when qi is abundant, it should be recognized as qi being deficient; when there is excess, it should be understood as insufficient. If lung qi is indeed abundant and excessive, then the clear and descending actions should not lead to wheezing, right? Because the fire invades the lungs, scorching the true yin, the condition of deficiency arises as wheezing. What is described as abundance and excess is not the qi of the lungs, but the fire within them. Haizang's argument surpasses those before him, revealing the profound truths of all ages. It is regrettable that it only touches upon the beginnings without tracing the source of the fire. I foolishly believe that excess fire corresponds to insufficient water; excess yang corresponds to insufficient yin. All the fiery reversals arise from the lower jiao where the heartfire is emitted from the liver and kidneys, hence they are termed \"reversed.\" When kidney water is deficient and declining, the heartfire rises too strongly, consuming the lung metal. How can there be no wheezing? Danxi said: \"Wheezing has its roots in yin deficiency, with fire rising from the lower abdomen.

The true deficiency lies in the essence of the kidneys; it is not simply about nourishing the blood with the Four Substances decoction. The fire that arises is from the lower burner, not something that can be suppressed by cold. Among patients, some have phlegm while others do not; the water rises with the wood and fire, and one cannot rely on bamboo sap, bitter orange, or pinellia to transform it. It is necessary to use the Six Flavor Rehmannia decoction with ophiopogon and a strong dose of five flavors to reinforce the water element, thus allowing the water to rise and the fire to descend, stabilizing the cough. This happens because the deficiency of the yin water generates fire; with fire, there is phlegm; with phlegm, there is coughing, which becomes more severe and leads to wheezing. This should be compared with the previously mentioned yin deficiency and its associated fire. Additionally, there is another condition that resembles fire but is not fire, that resembles coughing but is not coughing.

The kidney governs essence and is located in the lower jiao. If true yin is deficient and essence cannot transform into qi, then there is an obstruction in the upward exchange, resulting in shortness of breath. Shortness of breath is the basis for distress. When qi is already short and further dissipated, it is like pressing on an egg. Moreover, when qi is abundant, the pulse will be slippery, rapid, and strong; whereas when qi is deficient with no pathogenic factors, the pulse will be weak and lacking spirit. This illustrates the difference in pulse conditions. If one sees a floating and surging pulse, or a greatly wide pulse that disappears with slight pressure, this indicates a pulse with no foundation. If the pulse fluctuates strongly and is exceedingly large and rapid, yet is entirely lacking in harmony, it signals a defeat of the stomach qi, both representing significant deficiency.

Additionally, phlegm can also be generated from repressed qi, wind pathogens, damp stagnation, or weakness in the spleen and kidneys. If any of these factors contribute, they can lead to phlegm formation. If one attempts to treat phlegm without addressing its root cause, then the phlegm will never be resolved, and the wheezing cannot be cured. If the qi level is affected by pathogens, and there is excess qi in the upper jiao causing wheezing, or if emotional stress has caused liver injury, a robust person exhibiting fullness and a strong pulse can simply relieve the qi to self-recover from wheezing. In such cases, formulas like Kuaqing Yin, Sìchuāng Yin, Sìqī Decoction, Radish Seed Decoction, or Suzi Jiangqi Decoction are suitable. If there is stagnated qi in the Yangming channel leading to fullness, a mild purgative may be beneficial."},{"anchor":"trans-57p","marker":"57p","type":"translation","text":"**Treatment of Asthma** Asthma has its deep-rooted origins, and can be triggered by cold or exertion; it is also referred to as wheezing and asthma. When it is not manifesting, one should primarily focus on reinforcing the vital energy; when it does manifest, the main focus should be on eliminating the pathogenic factors. To reinforce the vital energy, one must differentiate between yin and yang. If there is deficiency, one should tonify yin; if there is yang deficiency, one should tonify yang. To eliminate pathogenic factors, one must assess the severity; one may need to dispel wind, warm cold, or clear phlegm and heat. However, in chronic cases, the vital energy is invariably deficient, so during the process of dispelling, it is advisable to cautiously add warmth and tonification, or to appropriately increase the dispersing methods within the tonification. In such instances, one should always focus on nourishing the original qi, ensuring that it gradually fills up, for this gives hope for gradual recovery.

When a person suddenly catches a wind-imbalance, and cold enters the lung meridian, it can lead to immediate wheezing, raised shoulders, labored breathing, and difficulty in expelling phlegm, making it impossible to lie down. The prescription includes one cash each of Chai Hu, Dang Gui, Huang Qin, Gan Cao, Ban Xia, and She Gan, and two cash each of Jie Geng, Mai Dong, and Fu Ling, to be decocted and taken. This formula excels in using Chai Hu, She Gan, and Jie Geng to disseminate and release the lung's vital energy, employing Ban Xia to eliminate phlegm, and using Huang Qin to clear heat. When one is externally invaded by cold, it must internally transform into a heat syndrome; thus, Huang Qin is used for its cleansing and resolving properties. However, using only Huang Qin, while it is said to clear heat, may inadvertently suppress the fire energy. The brilliance lies in the combination of Jie Geng, She Gan, and Chai Hu, which are warming and dispersive, effectively extinguishing fire and eliminating the pathogen. This is one method for urgent treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-59p","marker":"59p","type":"translation","text":"When a person experiences breathlessness and cannot lie down, and their phlegm flows out like a spring, yet their tongue is not dry and the breathlessness is not severe, lying down exacerbates the condition. This is not due to external causative wind but rather the cold energy within the kidneys. When there is no fire in the kidneys, the water has nothing to nourish it, rising up and causing phlegm. The water in the stomach then assists this surging force and cannot be stopped. The proper treatment is to use the Six Flavor Pill Decoction with the addition of a large dose of aconite and cinnamon, which will heat the kidney palace, allowing the water to return. Once the water returns to the palace, the breathlessness will subside and the person can lie down peacefully. For a person to sleep, the kidney energy and lung energy must interact; only then can the pathway be smooth and free from chaos. In the prescription, nourishing kidney fire allows for peaceful sleep. It is important to note that the kidney is the mother of the lung; when the child is at peace, the mother is also tranquil. The lung's metallic energy can return to the kidney palace to nourish its dissipating energy. Hence, nourishing kidney fire is truly a means to also nourish the lung's metal."},{"anchor":"trans-60p","marker":"60p","type":"translation","text":"Is the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan truly a miraculous remedy for nourishing kidney essence? It balances water and fire, providing stability to the lung's metal element; when the lungs and kidneys are harmonized, is there anyone who cannot sleep soundly yet feels very comfortable?

For excess wheezing, if the symptoms appear heavy and are less pronounced, use two qian of Huang Qin, three qian of Mai Dong, five fen of Gan Cao, and one qian each of Chai Hu, Su Ye, Shan Dou Gen, Ban Xia, and Wu Yao.

However, in cases of wheezing due to excess, the breath is often rapid, the throat makes noise, and the shoulders lift—unlike deficient wheezing, which is less urgent, with a silent throat and relaxed shoulders. Deficient wheezing indicates significant kidney deficiency, with the spleen’s energy on the verge of collapse, hence the urgent upward surges that struggle to break through but have not yet done so."},{"anchor":"trans-61p","marker":"61p","type":"translation","text":"The formula to alleviate severe breathlessness contains the following ingredients: one tael each of ginseng and prepared rehmannia, three qian each of shan zhu yu and white mustard seed, five qian of ophiopogon, one qian each of schisandra and achyranthes.

This condition is indeed a sign of imminent death; fortunately, a faint breath lingers in the upper and lower realms. If cool medicines are used to balance the fire, it hastens their demise. Similarly, using cinnamon and aconite to supplement the fire will also accelerate the end. When the vital energy approaches extinction, it should be gently supported, not urgently restored, just like a dying fire that still has a few embers—kindling it with firewood is advisable. If one abruptly throws sulfur or similar substances onto it, the fire will be extinguished. Moreover, using cold and cool substances to stir it leads to a rare chance of renewal. The brilliance of this formula lies in its combination of kidney and lung tonics. When used together with ginseng, it directly penetrates the very essence of yin, giving rise to kidney energy, which in turn generates lung energy, thus sustaining life in the realm of nothingness.

Observing his complexion, yellow with a hint of green, indicated that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen earth, resembling a child's chronic fright syndrome.
