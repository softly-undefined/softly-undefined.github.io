<p><strong>On Pestilence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Responses</strong></p>
<p>In winter, injury from the cold leads to illness in spring.<br>[Note: This refers to the transformation of severe Yin into Yang disease.]<br>Essence is the foundation of the body; therefore, those who store their essence do not suffer from spring illnesses.<br>[Note: If one can preserve their essence, then the blood and Qi are solid within, and evil influences do not invade from outside, thus they do not fall ill in spring.]</p>
<p><strong>On Water and Heat Points</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: When a person is injured by cold and manifests heat, why is this? Qibo replied: Extreme cold leads to heat.<br>[Note: Extreme cold generates heat; it is heat that arises from cold.]</p>
<p><strong>Zhong Zang Jing</strong> (Han Dynasty – Hua Tuo)</p>
<p><strong>On Death Pulses</strong></p>
<p>In warm diseases, if sweating has not occurred after three or four days and the pulse is too rapid, the person will die.<br>In warm diseases, if the pulse is fine and weak and does not come and go smoothly, and the chest feels blocked, the person will die.<br>In warm diseases with severe fever, if the pulse is unexpectedly small, the person will die.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>When the epidemic disease is severe, if the pulse fluctuates and is not regulated, the patient dies.<br>When the epidemic disease causes abdominal pain and diarrhea, the patient dies.<br>When the epidemic disease does not produce sweat, or if sweat does not reach the feet, the patient dies.</p>
<hr>
<p>Epidemic Disease</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the symptoms of illnesses among people of different ages often appear similar, and this is termed an epidemic disease. There are irregular influences in all seasons. Spring and summer can have cold and clear times, while autumn and winter may experience warm and hot periods. When people are affected by the harmful influences of the epidemic, illnesses occur similarly across ages during the year, described as the seasonal influence, commonly referred to as &quot;heavenly movement.&quot; </p>
<p>Old Master’s Divine Spirit Powder, Wu Chengzi’s Firefly Pills, Saint Powder, and Expel Toxin Powder are all used. If spring should be warm but clear energy is suppressed, then the evil is blamed on the liver; if summer should be hot but cold energy is suppressed, it is attributed to the heart; if autumn should be cool but strong heat is suppressed, it points to the lungs; if winter should be cold but strong warmth is suppressed, then it concerns the kidneys. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states: The poison of winter warmth differs greatly from that of cold damage. Indeed, cold damage arises from the influence of cold; winter warmth results from being affected by warm energy; cold epidemics are caused by sudden cold shocks, not due to exposure. Their treatment methods differ, as do the cold, heat, warmth, and coolness of the remedies applied. It cannot be strictly bound by days; sweating, vomiting, and purging must be executed according to symptoms. </p>
<p>In summary, treat heat with cold and administer warmth; treat warmth with clarity and apply coolness; treat cold with heat and administer coolness; treat clarity with warmth and apply heat. Aim for balance, without excess; this is the fundamental approach.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Warming Illness</strong></p>
<p>Before the summer solstice, if one experiences fever and aversion to cold, headache, and body aches, with a floating and tight pulse, this is called warming illness. If winter is hurt by the cold, those who are slightly affected can develop warming illness before the summer solstice, mainly due to the warm energy of spring. The treatment for warming illness differs from that for winter cold or summer heat illnesses, as the heat is lighter. Shengma Decoction, Jiejus Decoction, and Chaihu Guizhi Decoction are the best. For those with more heat, Xiao Chaihu Decoction is the main remedy; for those who are not thirsty but have slight heat, it is Xiao Chaihu plus Guizhi; for those with a cough, it is Xiao Chaihu plus Wuweizi. If there is restlessness, thirst, and fever, without aversion to cold and with virtual restlessness, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction, taken sequentially. Ma Huang, Guizhi, and Da Qinglong are used consistently in the northwest regions throughout all seasons, with no exceptions. In the warmer areas between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, the standard formulas should only be used in winter and early spring. From late spring to before the summer solstice, adjustments to Guizhi, Ma Huang, and Da Qinglong are necessary.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>On the Confucian Duty to One&#39;s Parents</strong><br><strong>by Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>The illnesses of spring, summer, autumn, and winter—such as the warm diseases of spring, heat diseases of summer, intermittent fevers and dysentery of autumn, and cold conditions and coughs of winter—are all caused by the improper seasonal influences collectively referred to as &quot;harmful cold.&quot; Those who toil and labor excessively may come into contact with these inappropriate seasonal winds, heat, and dampness, resulting in illness. When a person is harmed by cold, heat accumulates within; if this manifests mildly, it appears as spring warmth. If it does not arise in spring but is significantly affected by summer heat, it becomes a heat illness in summer; if unaddressed in summer and impacted by dampness, it transforms into intermittent fevers and dysentery in autumn; if not resolved in autumn and exposed to cold, it becomes harmful cold in winter. Thus, the harmful cold has the deepest effects. However, both harmful cold and warm heat first present with symptoms of fever and aversion to cold, along with pain in the head and neck and stiffness in the back, which occurs in one day of the solar period. Though the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that one day of the sun represents usual transmission, there are cases of solar symptoms that do not transmit and only present with sweating, such as with the use of medications like Shengma Decoction, Xiejia Decoction, Baiduxing Powder, and Wujisuan, which can promote dispersal and lead to recovery.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The patient has a severe fever; if treated with hot and spicy substances, the illness will certainly worsen. Recently, Mr. Liu Hejian has formulated a cooling remedy, combining Shengsheng and Yiyuan powders, each five to seven qian, with one bowl of water, adding more than ten slices of fresh ginger, over twenty scallion tops, and a pinch of fermented soybean. Boil until it reaches five or seven bubbles, then strain off the residue and divide into two doses. First, take most of it, then with a finger, stimulate the throat to induce vomiting, expelling the previous medicine. This initial purge opens the pores, causing sweating all over the body. Then, with the remaining medicine warmed up, take it again, also adding sour vinegar and spicy congee, which can lead to immediate recovery. </p>
<p>To alleviate the harm from cold and damp febrile diseases, two methods exist. During times of peace, when people are mostly calm and content without much labor, all that is still belongs to Yin. Even if warming agents are used to dispel exterior ailments and induce sweating, recovery can still be achieved. However, during chaotic times when disturbances are frequent, the comet behaves irregularly, military affairs arise, famine follows in succession, and the burdens are heavy, it is Yang. With internal heat also encroaching, if the physician does not understand the changes in the times and continues to use hot and spicy treatments, it deviates from human sentiment.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The remedy can utilize Liu Hejian&#39;s cooling agents. Within three days of treatment, ten out of nine patients recover. I have used this medicine for over forty years to treat conditions caused by cold, heat, summer heat, and hidden heat, the number of which is countless. This is not an exaggeration; rather, it is to caution future generations against misusing medicines. I have observed that some physicians use Rhubarb and Wujia to treat conditions caused by cold and warm epidemics, which often leads to delirium, nosebleeds, blood loss, wheezing, confusion, and distress. These symptoms do not only occur in cases of cold injury, but are all due to the inability to heal with warm agents, causing the heat to increase sharply. </p>
<p>When treating cold-induced ailments during epidemics, one should first consider the principles of temperature extremes in nature, turning to Ginseng. In regions with hot climates, it is advisable to use cooling agents; in regions with cold climates, warming agents are more suitable. In the months of midday and midday’s peak, where heat is prevalent, cooling remedies should be used; in the months of the Rat and Ox, where frost is common, warming remedies are advisable. Younger individuals with strong constitutions should use cooling agents; older individuals with weakened vitality should use warming agents.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If a patient falls ill from exposure to cold and eating raw food, they should be treated with warming spices; if they become ill from overwork in the heat, they should be treated with cooling spices. For patients with a hot and irritable temperament, cooling spices may be suitable; for those with a gentle and calm temperament, warming spices would be appropriate. If a patient has a large and floating pulse in both wrists, they can be treated with cooling spices; if the pulses are slow and weak, warming spices should be used. Such illnesses cannot be treated with a one-size-fits-all approach. One must be aware of the variations in heat, cold, and the use of warming or cooling remedies—they should not be applied rigidly. Just as the earth has its north and south directions, seasons have their cold and heat, individuals can be weak or strong, pulses can be floating or sinking, and the dosages of remedies should not be mistaken. Patients’ prohibitions and limitations must be understood. In the past, there was someone who fell ill during the spring season and contracted an epidemic; after traveling over a hundred miles in a donkey cart within three days, they became disoriented upon disembarking and died several days later. Another person consumed too much alcohol and suffered internal and external disturbances; they experienced headaches and fever that resembled typhoid. After being carried back home on a horse for sixty to seventy miles over three or four days, they arrived home in severe pain all over and died in confusion. I have witnessed these cases myself.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If it is of this sort, there is no need to elaborate further. In the case of plague, typhoid fever, febrile diseases, heatstroke, exposure to wind, or intoxication, one must be careful to avoid transportation by horse or carriage, which causes shaking and jostling—this is a major taboo. Motion is the transformation of fire, while stillness is the transformation of water. Stillness is yin, and motion is yang. Yang is heat, while yin is cold. When illness has already disrupted the internal balance, further external disturbances lead to aggravation, which is burdensome for the spirit—how can one endure that? Therefore, for those who fall ill on long journeys, it is advisable to float in a boat or lie on a bed, ensuring no external disturbances occur, so that the illness does not worsen. Additionally, if one experiences typhoid fever or plague and has not had a bowel movement for six or seven days, with hardness below the heart and tight fullness in the abdomen and sides, then one may administer a small dose of purgative decoction.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If the intestines and stomach are overheated, one must be careful not to use poisonous drugs like croton seeds or apricot kernels, as both are hot and very toxic. Even if one takes one or two pills, causing a laxative effect five or seven times, it will inevitably harm the yin energy, deplete the bodily fluids, and increase dryness and heat, leading to yellowing of the eyes, delirium, frantic movements, blood leakage, and disarray. In mild cases, it may lead to recovery from exhaustion, while in severe cases, it could be fatal, with only rare instances of recovery. Thus, one should not adopt this as a method. </p>
<p>Therefore, for those recently recovering from a cold, one must be careful not to eat pork, fish, mixed fruits, strong liquor, or engage in bathing or similar activities. If one violates this, the illness is sure to relapse. Those who care for their health must be vigilant. </p>
<p>Moreover, during the months of February and March, when the yang energy rises and epidemics are rampant, one will often first experience headaches or joint pains, resembling symptoms of cold, seasonal ailments, heatstroke, wind-damp conditions, or alcohol intoxication. One must be cautious not to use croton seeds, which are highly toxic, to treat such conditions. </p>
<p>In the spring of the first year of Yuan Guang, in the capital, a scholar named Li Pingshan contracted epidemic symptoms, including headache, fever, dry mouth, and dark, painful urination. He had a penchant for drinking, and the doctor mistakenly gave him a medicine meant for alcohol intoxication, which contained croton seeds, resulting in more than ten bowel movements. The next day, his headaches and other ailments persisted, yet the doctor was unaware and instead prescribed spicy warming remedies, and added that he should rest on a warm kang (bed stove), forcing him to consume scallion vinegar soup in hopes of inducing sweating. Unbeknownst to them, various heat-related conditions rapidly emerged together, leading to yellowing of the eyes, tidal fever, blood leakage, and severe shortness of breath. Although a purgative was later administered, it was already too late.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>To this day, those who discuss it are numerous, yet they still do not recognize the fault of using hot medicine, often solely blaming Chengqi Decoction. Those who use Chengqi Decoction are unaware that the illness is already critical, and still administer the medication because they misunderstand the texts. This can indeed be blamed. However, it is also blameworthy that the critics do not hold the wine symptom pill accountable. When dealing with epidemic symptoms on the surface, one should not purgative, let alone use the pill made from cowbane. If cowbane is not effective, how can one continue to use the warming and acrid agent? There must be a reason why Confucius and the esteemed Gongye Chang are not at fault. The non-straightforwardness of Wei Shenggao is also questionable; he ultimately refuses to dedicate several years to the arduous study of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; but instead follows the opinions and preferences of the crowd, thus earning both praise and criticism. Those like this are mere nonsensical critics. Failing to truly understand the principles, yet hastily attributing blame or praise, is not something a gentleman would do. In my opinion, there are six prohibitions regarding cold damage: at the onset of the illness, it resembles a case of food poisoning from drinking; thus, the first prohibition is against heavy purging. When sweating, one must carefully consider the current temperature and whether to use thick or light bedding, avoiding hot baths or heated kang beds, and being cautious with hot porridge and needles; this is the second prohibition.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>When sweating occurs, it is advisable to carefully examine the pulse for its slow rate and use cooling remedies, avoiding the reckless use of hot medicines—this is the first prohibition. At that moment, one should carefully consider the appropriate remedy, avoiding the use of Ba Dou (croton) and Silver Powder pills—this is the second prohibition. For patients who have come from afar, it is forbidden for them to be transported by cart or horse—this is the third prohibition. After significant sweating, one should avoid mixed foods and indulgent desires, as well as excessive worry and labor—this is the fourth prohibition. Therefore, for anyone with these issues, it is advisable to keep the room cool and the bed airy to prevent exposure to harmful heat; ensure the windows are bright and the room is well-lit, making it easy to observe changes in complexion. If the patient prefers cooling foods, then serve them cool; if they prefer warm foods, then serve them warm. Keep things clear without disturbance; allow them rest without exertion. If something can be treated with warming, use warming treatments; if cooling is needed, then apply cooling treatments. Observations must be very subtle without rigid restrictions. For those who desire water, be very cautious not to forbid it. However, after drinking, frequently massage their abdomen, which will help stimulate digestion. If one massages the middle area too long, pain will definitely occur, and if the patient experiences pain due to fluid accumulation, then they will hesitate to press on it. It is crucial to avoid what should be prohibited; if taken lightly, it may be dangerous, and in serious cases, it could lead to death. Likewise, if something is wrongly forbidden, the same applies.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> (Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p><strong>Epidemic Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epidemics are illnesses that affect many people, also referred to as seasonal epidemics. There are three treatment principles: to tonify, to disperse, and to lower. For severe heat, add three cups of children&#39;s urine and wine. The &quot;big head&quot; epidemic is caused by dampness at high altitudes, so do not use methods to lower it. Winter warmth as a disease means the presence of its qi out of season. During the severe cold of winter, a noble person should close up and contain, and release it externally, mainly using tonic medicines along with exterior-releasing medicines, such as those that tonify the middle and boost qi.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Collection</strong> (Ming - Tao Hua)</p>
<p><strong>Big Head Cold</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;big head&quot; refers to both seasonal poison and epidemic poison. It arises when the qi of the sky&#39;s epidemic poison affects people, leading to big head colds. If it begins with redness and swelling on the nose and forehead, resulting in a face that is highly swollen and unable to open, with red and swollen facial features, this is associated with the Yangming channel. If there is intense fever, shortness of breath, dry mouth, or swollen sore throat, and a rapid pulse, use the Pujixiaodu Decoction. If there is severe internal heat, use the Tongsheng Xiaodu Decoction. If it appears around the ears, both front and back, with redness and swelling of the head, this is associated with the Shaoyang channel. If there is daytime fevers, alternating chills and heat, bitter mouth, dry throat, eye pain, and fullness in the sides, use Lesser Chaihu Decoction with added Tianhuafen, Qianghuo, Jingjiao, Lianqiao, Qinqin, and Lian.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>If it manifests at the back of the neck and under the base of the skull, as well as redness and swelling behind the eyes, this belongs to the Taiyang category; it should be treated with Jingfang Baidu San. If all three Yang channels are affected, and the evil manifests in the head, face, ears, eyes, and nose, administer Puji Xiaodu Yin and apply Qingliang Jiuku San externally. Generally, the treatment should not be too harsh; if you attack too strongly, the pathogenic qi will not submit and will instead retaliate internally, certainly harming the patient. Furthermore, if the head and face are depleted, this emptiness will reach everywhere. The treatment should start gentle and then become more intense, so that the evil can be subdued. The initial gentle approach should focus on reducing heat and dispelling toxins, while also supporting the vital energy of the deficient person. For those with weak stomach qi and poor appetite, aid the stomach qi as well. If their stools are hot and constipated, use Dahuang to purge and expel the root of the toxin. This is the initial gentle method. This toxin first causes swelling of the nose, then the ears, and spreads from the ears to the head, linking to the back of the brain; when it forms a lump, it will not disperse and will certainly turn into pus.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Seasonal Illness</strong></p>
<p>Seasonal illness refers to the fierce influences of heavenly timing that flow through the human realm. Whenever the seasonal cycles are misaligned, this energy manifests. For example, if spring should be warm but instead is cold, if summer should be hot but instead is cool, if autumn should be cool but instead is hot, and if winter should be cold but instead is warm, then the air of improper timing is at play. </p>
<p>Such disruptive influences harm the true vital energy, akin to how a weak wall invites thieves. However, if true vitality is robust, it is difficult for evil forces to intrude. The ailments caused by this are similar to those of cold damage. Cold damage occurs due to cold weather, while seasonal illness arises from exposure to pestilential energies; thus, their treatments cannot be the same, although dispersing medicines can be common to both.</p>
<p>For all dispersing decoctions: </p>
<ul>
<li>In spring, if there is cold, and the evil is in the liver, use Shengma and Gekegen decoction. </li>
<li>In summer, if there is coolness, and the evil is in the heart, use Tiaozhong decoction. </li>
<li>In autumn, if there is heat, and the evil is in the lungs, use Cangzhu and Baihu decoction. </li>
<li>In winter, if there is warmth, and the evil is in the kidneys, use Weirui decoction.</li>
</ul>
<p>For pestilential disease and the dispelling of toxic energies, if the exterior does not recover, use Qianghuo Conghe decoction, Zhengqi powder, Conghe Qianghuo powder, or Xiong Su powder, selecting as needed.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Plague</strong></p>
<p>The Classics say: When the yang channels are weak and the yin channels are tight, and when one encounters the plague qi, it transforms into a plague. This is often caused by an initial cold damage; if the prior heat has not been resolved and one is exposed to the seasonal plague qi, it results in the plague. For treatment, it should be approached similarly to that of the plague and intermittent fevers.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>The cold epidemic is an illness caused by severe cold from the heavens. During the four seasons, if the heavens suddenly bring about extreme cold, and it leads to illness similar to a cold, it is called a cold epidemic. The symptoms are similar to those of standard cold damage, but the severe cold is milder. If the illness begins with headache, fever, aversion to cold, and tightness, or with nausea and vomiting, fullness in the middle, or food stagnation and lack of digestion, or abdominal pain: if there is no fever yet, one should use a modified Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San for treatment; if fever has already developed, then a Xin Wei Qiong Su San should promote sweating. If there is body pain, joint pain, and fever, Qiang Huo Chong He Tang with Zi Su should be the treatment. If sweating has occurred, do not induce sweating again, but use a modified Chong He Tang instead. If the evil heat does not dissipate and transforms into internal symptoms, one should treat it according to the principles for standard cold damage.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>Epidemics</strong></p>
<p>Epidemics are similar to ghostly afflictions, hence called epidemics, also referred to as seasonal illnesses. In spring, warmth should prevail but instead is clear; in summer, heat should dominate but instead is cool; in autumn, coolness should reign but instead there is great heat; in winter, cold is expected but instead there is excessive warmth. When these conditions arise out of season, those who are affected will show symptoms such as headaches, body aches, chills, and fever, regardless of age, all presenting similarly. </p>
<p>In cases that differ slightly from seasonal febrile illnesses: in spring, clear conditions involve the liver and are treated with Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction; in summer, heat involves the heart and is addressed with Er Xiang San or Tiao Zhong Decoction; in autumn, dampness affects the lungs and is treated with Bai Hu Decoction plus Cang Zhu Decoction or Yin Chen Wu Ling San; in winter, cold impacts the kidneys, treated with Wei Rui Decoction or Gan Ju Decoction. </p>
<p>When the earth is abundant across the four seasons, one should use remedies according to the classic texts. Treatments that are similar to those for febrile illnesses include Bai Du San for exterior syndromes, Xiao Chai Hu Tang for half-exterior cases, and Da Chai Hu Tang for interior conditions. For those suffering from internal injuries, the treatment should both replenish and disperse; Ren Zhong Huang Wan can be employed. The classics state: epidemic qi does not adhere to diagnosis, but rather should be understood through the nuances of seasonal changes.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Whenever entering a house affected by an epidemic, use sesame oil, or dip paper wicks in sesame oil along with powdered arsenic yellow and cinnabar, and insert them into the ears and nose; this is the best method to ward off the foul and toxic air that fills the countryside. Additionally, using the Ruyi pill is also excellent.</p>
<p>The classics say: Spring brings warmth, summer brings heat, autumn brings coolness, and winter brings bitterness. The toxic effects of cold damage come from their capacity to kill. When one is harmed by the four seasons&#39; qi, which meridian is affected, and what illness arises? Generally, if spring is harmed by wind, summer will certainly bring diarrhea; if summer is harmed by heat, autumn will surely bring fevers and dysentery; if autumn is harmed by dampness, winter will certainly bring coughs; if winter is harmed by cold, summer will certainly bring miasmic fever. Miasmic fever comes every other day; intermittent fever comes daily. Coughs resulting from autumn&#39;s dampness and winter&#39;s cold battling together produce phlegm and lead to coughing. If winter is harmed by cold, miasmic fever will arise, and with spring&#39;s warm air battling it, it will turn into a warm disease. Thus, the regular qi of the four seasons can also deviate in timing, all due to disturbances that push the source of illness backwards. It is not just the time of injury that forecasts today&#39;s illness; hence, there are times when lingering conditions dissipate without manifesting as illness. Should one simply adhere to one theory? However, if one feels some internal disturbance or discomfort in the heart and abdomen, do not change the formula of Jinxing Zhenqi powder; instead, adjust it to correct the stomach qi.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Cold Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>When the spring equinox arrives and extends to the autumn equinox, a sudden cold is termed as a cold epidemic, which is different from winter&#39;s cold damage. In March and April, there may be sudden cold; the yang energy is still weak, so the cold can cause illness, but the heat symptoms are still mild. In May and June, as yang energy becomes strong, the impact of cold leads to more severe heat symptoms. In July and August, as yang energy wanes, the cold causes only mild illness. </p>
<p>Those affected will exhibit symptoms similar to summer heat but with different treatments. This is because summer heat arises internally with the cold, while cold epidemic comes from external exposure. A regulated middle decoction should be the main remedy, adjusted according to the varying temperatures and conditions. Spicy cool or warm herbs can be added or reduced accordingly. The weakening occurs when the yang energy is suppressed, leading to heat. If the symptoms are mild and the yang energy is not significantly affected and hasn&#39;t yet developed into fever, one should look for remedies within the cold prevention medicines.</p>
<p>In spring, if one is afflicted by sudden heat, it is also referred to as a warm disease. If the cold harm from sweating and purging does not resolve the symptoms, it is likewise termed as warm disease. However, one should treat according to the specific channel symptoms, generally avoiding sweating and purging. For sudden warmth, remedies like Gardenia and Schizonepeta Decoction or the Nine-Flavor Qianghuo Decoction are suggested. For those with unresolved symptoms, a combination of Ginseng, Peony, and other herbal decoctions may be recommended.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>On Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;febrile disease&quot; refers to illnesses caused by the severe cold and lethal energies of winter. When these energies come into contact with a person, they may immediately fall ill, and this is termed &quot;febrile disease.&quot; If the illness does not manifest immediately, the cold toxin remains dormant in the skin and may transform into a febrile disease in spring or into a heat-related illness in summer. A heat-related illness is a more intense form of fever than a febrile disease. Once it has transformed into a febrile disease, it cannot be referred to as cold; those who do not despise cold yet experience thirst exemplify this. This is the essence of Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s teachings. </p>
<p>The herbs Ephedra and cinnamon twig are designated for the immediate illness of febrile diseases; what connection do they have with warmth and heat? Although the source of the illness is the same, the timing of the onset is different. Zhang Zhongjing treated these conditions with a distinct approach, which has been largely lost and remains unclear, leading to much debate among different schools of thought even today. Liu Shouzheng suggested that if one intends to use Ephedra and cinnamon twig, they must be combined with cooling herbs to prevent the onset of jaundice. Zhang Zihe&#39;s formula of Liu Shen Tong&#39;s dispersive powder, which incorporates gypsum, alongside Ephedra and Atractylodes, is also inappropriate. Ephedra and cinnamon twig are spicy and warm, and are suitable for dispersing cold pathogens in winter; they should not be used in spring or summer. Tao&#39;s notion that the Jiu Wei Qiang Huo Decoction could substitute for three different formulas is likewise incorrect.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Qianghuo Decoction, a formula created by Yi Lao, is designed to treat the inappropriate qi of the four seasons. For example, in spring it is suitable to be warm but instead it is cold; in summer it should be hot but instead it is warm; in autumn it should be cool but instead it is hot; in winter it should be cold but instead it is warm. Furthermore, during spring, summer, and autumn, there are instances of severe cold, which, although accompanied by symptoms of aversion to cold and fever, do not compare to the harshness of winter&#39;s sinister cold. Therefore, there is no need for Mahuang or Guizhi to disperse the cold; instead, it is better to use spicy and cool medicines to relieve both internal and external conditions. Moreover, this formula must be adjusted according to the principles of the six meridians and cannot be used in its entirety. It is better to use Xiaoyao Powder, which is particularly effective as one formula can replace three. If one wishes to treat warm diseases, what should be done? I have a method to explain. The classic states: if one does not dislike the cold and feels thirsty, this is the case. Not disliking the cold indicates that there is no cold evil on the surface; feeling thirsty suggests that the kidney&#39;s water is depleted. This is because such individuals have pre-existing fire; when exposed to cold qi in winter, though injured, it is not severe. The internal fire prevents the cold from penetrating deeply, which is why it does not produce immediate symptoms but instead hides beneath the skin. From winter into March or April, as time passes, the cold can stagnate within while the internal fire weakens, ultimately leading to the depletion of kidney water.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The wood element is associated with the spirit of yang, deriving its vitality from the water of the gui. When the kidney water becomes depleted, and at this time, the strong wood becomes vigorous without any source to nurture and moisten it, thus leading to heat and thirst, not due to an external cold invasion. Hai Zang states that new afflictions can provoke old ones, which is incorrect. If there is a new cold invasion, it will lead to aversion to cold. I use Liu Wei Di Huang to nourish the water, and Chai Hu, a cooling and acrid medicine, to relieve the stagnation of wood, responding flexibly to the body&#39;s needs; this method has brought many back to health. I also expand upon this principle. Generally, those who suffer from a cold during winter also exhibit symptoms of stagnant fire. If such a person has no fire, they are at the midpoint. Only when there is fire does it spread from skin and muscles to the internal organs. Nowadays, people say that cold pathogens penetrate inward, transforming into heat. If it is indeed a cold pathogen, why does it enter and then turn into heat? What causes it to transform into heat? It is unknown that it is the internal fire itself, trapped by cold, unable to vent, which then perpetuates itself. Over time, pure heat accumulates while cold dissipates. Therefore, I use San Huang to detoxify and resolve this fire.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Shengma and Gegeng are treatments for fire constraint, while the three承气 (Chengqi) formulas address earth constraint. Xiao Chaihu Decoction resolves wood constraint. This principle is very simple and easy to understand, but it has been obscured by the various interpretations found in the classics, leading to confusion. All mixed symptoms that include fever typically present with headaches, stiff necks, eye pain, dry noses, rib pain, and bitter mouths. There is no need to restrict the treatment to just typhoid fever and its specific formulas. In winter, when typhoid fever is prevalent, I alone treat with Mahuang and Guizhi formulas for cold constraint, while for those who do not share a dislike for the cold, I treat with fire constraint. This is not a foolish invention, and those who hear it are often astonished. Additionally, when reading Yu Tianmin’s &quot;Medical Correct Records&quot; in the section on typhoid fever, it states that an enlightened person passed down that transmitted fever is a constraint disease. Upon seeing this, I felt secretly pleased, believing this echoed my own thoughts. On examining the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the Emperor asks why people injured by cold manifest as heat. Qibo replies that the principle is that cold air condenses externally while causing internal constraint. The pores are tight and closed, so the qi cannot circulate freely, leading to the accumulation of dampness. Externally, cold pressure combined with internal constraint causes the heat to arise; thus, when a person is harmed by cold, it transitions into heat. If sweating occurs, recovery follows, which clarifies the principle of external condensation coupled with internal constraint. From this observation, it is clear that my view of typhoid fever as fire constraint is not without evidence.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;In winter, one is harmed by the cold; in spring, one is sure to fall ill from warmth,&quot; indicating that warm disease is indeed a result of cold injury. However, cold injury manifests differently in each season. For instance, if one contracts a cold infection in winter, it is true cold injury. If cold toxins invade internally before manifesting as illness, they will wait for the warming influence of spring, at which point the genuine yang is overwhelmed and the cold pathogens reassert themselves, leading to illness. Therefore, if someone encounters cold in spring, it manifests as warm disease; if they encounter cold in summer, it appears as heat disease. This is similar to how those injured by qi flare up upon encountering qi, and those injured by food react to food—the principles are the same. </p>
<p>However, cold-related epidemics often arise when the essence is not stored in winter, particularly among the hungry and overworked. Not storing essence in winter allows the evil qi to invade easily, while those suffering from hunger and fatigue are particularly vulnerable. Thus, after a great famine, there will inevitably be a significant epidemic, precisely for this reason. Once this epidemic qi becomes prominent, it will surely spread, first affecting the physically weak and unclean, and then gradually spreading to others, leading to illnesses that do not necessarily wait for winter&#39;s cold. Nevertheless, these diseases are fundamentally attributed to the cold nature dominating the qi.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>As for the changes in weather and climate, they vary with the seasons. Hence, during winter, when following spring protocols, one feels cold instead of warmth; during summer, following winter protocols, one feels heat instead of cold. The same applies to spring and autumn. This results in a situation where there is the influence of the seasons without being in their proper time. The strong remain unharmed, while the timid suffer; this extends beyond just winter cold, reflecting the harm of improper climatic influences, which one should be aware of and carefully avoid.</p>
<p>Epidemics are essentially diseases caused by external evils, primarily manifested in the form of febrile illnesses such as typhus. However, when one contracts these seasonal conditions, the symptoms may not always align, leading to what we term an epidemic. The ancients have said that epidemic conditions arise due to warm air in the spring, which leads to internal heat manifesting outwardly, and not necessarily from cold injuries to the surface. Thus, it&#39;s appropriate to use mild, warming remedies; treatment differs from that for typical cold injuries with ephedra. This notion certainly has its basis, but it is not always true. If an epidemic were not a surface condition, why would sweating be necessary for relief? Therefore, in my earlier discussions, I posited that one first succumbs to cold influences, then manifests the illness—a logical conclusion. However, during that time, cold and heat can exist, and symptoms may indicate either yin or yang. Treatments for yang and heat conditions can indeed be effective in winter, while treatments for yin and cold conditions can be applied in spring and summer. It is advisable to tailor treatment according to symptoms and conditions; stating that superficial cold injuries do not occur would not hold true.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In cases of illness from cold or epidemics, if the pulse is large, rapid, slippery, and also has a hint of weakness, it can be treated. If the pulse is large and rapid but excessively tense, it is critical. If the pulse is floating and large but lacks strength upon pressure, it is advisable to supplement and also address the exterior. If the body feels hot but the pulse is weak, the primary treatment should be plain supplementation, occasionally with slight warming dispersal. If the body is very hot and the pulse is deep, thick, fine, and the feet are cold, it is hard to treat. In cases of epidemic illness lasting four to five days, if there is fever, abdominal distention, and vomiting, with a pulse that is thin and string-like but strong, death occurs within twelve days. For epidemic illness lasting two to three days, with headache, abdominal distention, a straight and rapid pulse, death occurs within eight days. In cases of epidemic illness lasting eight to nine days, if there is no pain in the head or body, no change in color, but continuous diarrhea, with hardness under the heart and a pulse that is not bulging—sometimes strong—death occurs within seventeen days. If there is no sweating in epidemic illness, or if sweating does not reach the lower parts, death is imminent. In cases of epidemic illness with severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, death is expected. The above outlines conditions that lead to death, but other details should be referred to in the section on cold damage.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Six Essentials of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Since ancient times, the methods for treating cold-induced illnesses have been vast and profound. I have pondered this for a long time, and when I compiled these methods, I found that I did not always see the illness while encountering the symptoms, nor did I always match the methods to the conditions. This shows that diseases often change form and can be difficult to grasp. Therefore, it is essential to be flexible and understand the key principles. </p>
<p>Thus, in my commentary on the &quot;Classified Classics,&quot; I have outlined six important principles for treating cold-related illnesses: sweating, supplementation, warming, clearing, vomiting, and purging. However, these merely present an overview without going into detail. I now summarize all the methods here to address what is lacking in treating cold illnesses. If one seeks the core principles of Zhongjing, they should still read the foundational texts on cold-induced illnesses, to be able to cross-reference and substantiate each other, leading to a comprehensive understanding. In this way, one finds precision and completeness, and the essentials for saving lives should not go beyond this.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Sweating has six essentials and five prohibitions.</p>
<p>In the treatment of febrile diseases, I have already analyzed the six essentials; beyond these six, there are also five prohibitions. Why is this? Among the six methods, sweating is the primary one, as recovery from febrile illnesses invariably occurs through sweating. Thus, although there are six methods, sweating truly encompasses them all, and the five methods beyond sweating largely also aim to induce sweating. Typically, sweating is achieved by using pungent dispersing ingredients. However, why can the five methods also induce sweating? If the six essentials are present, why is there a need for distinctions regarding the five prohibitions? The reason is that sweating results from the liquefaction of fluids, emerging from yang and originating from yin. </p>
<p>If the skin is tightly closed and the nutrients (ying) and protective (wei) energies do not move, then without using pungent dispersants, the foundational forces cannot open, and sweating will not occur—this is the first reason. Secondly, if pathogenic heat burns internally, causing the blood to dry and bodily fluids to deplete, then without using cooling methods, the yin energy cannot nourish, and sweating will not occur—this is the second reason. Thirdly, if yin pathogens are firmly closed, preventing the passage of yang energy, then without employing pungent warming methods, the flow will be blocked, and sweating will not occur—this is the third reason. Fourthly, if the nutrients and protective energies are deficient and there is an internal deficiency, then without using strong tonics, blood and qi cannot be replenished and sweating will not occur—this is the fourth reason. Lastly, if the pathogen is located in the upper burner, obstructing the pathways for yang, then without inducing vomiting or purging, the clear qi cannot rise, and sweating will not occur—this is the fifth reason.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>If a邪 has entered the Yangming and the stomach qi is obstructed, then without promoting a downward flow, the turbid qi will not disperse and sweat will not be released; this is the sixth point. All of these pertain to the method of inducing sweat, which is what is known as the six essentials. What are the five taboos? First, if heat is on the surface but is not true fire within, one must avoid cold; cold causes the yin邪 to congeal and not disperse, which will deepen the邪 and worsen the yang, resulting in death if sweating cannot occur. Second, if the original qi is weak and cannot overcome邪, one must avoid depleting; depletion reduces the正氣, and without replenishment the邪 will strengthen, worsening the condition until sweating cannot happen, leading to death. Third, if there is a real邪 inside that has formed and there is internal fire inflammation, one must avoid warm tonics; warmth further dries and tonics strengthen the邪, causing death if sweating cannot happen. Fourth, if the center is deficient and the qi is weak, all rules regarding sweating should be heeded; one must avoid dispersion; dispersing causes the qi to escape, and if qi escapes, sweating cannot occur, leading to death. Fifth, if the disease is not due to real邪 in the Yangming, one must avoid purging; purging depletes yin, and if yin is deficient, yang邪 becomes deeply entrenched, resulting in death if sweating cannot occur. These are the five taboos. To know the six essentials and avoid the five taboos is the entirety of treating febrile diseases. However, there are many instances of false heat and few of true heat; only those with exceptional insight can detect subtle differences. My earnestness is also aimed at those who delve deeply into these principles.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Method of Inducing Sweating</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold and epidemic diseases, when the initial symptoms are present, it is crucial to induce sweating promptly; delay is not permissible. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing said: In general, when inducing sweating through medicinal decoctions, even if the prescription states to take it three times a day, if the illness is severe and does not resolve, one should take all three doses within half a day. If after taking one dose the symptoms persist, one should take the original decoction again. If there are those who refuse to sweat, they may need to take three doses before relenting. If sweating cannot be induced, it is considered a deadly condition. This is what is meant by not delaying the act of sweating. However, when inducing sweating, one must also observe the balance of the vital energy and the pathological condition. If the disease arises suddenly, and the exterior symptoms are present without the vital energy being depleted, then one should simply use pungent and neutral substances to disperse the pathogens directly. If there are mixed symptoms, one should assess the nature of the cold or heat and treat accordingly, rather than merely focusing on dispersing.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>If the body is very hot, the external symptoms are all present, yet the pulse is weak, it is necessary to avoid sweating. One must carefully investigate and apply methods to replenish the deficiency. If the distinction between superficial and fundamental conditions is not understood and strong remedies are applied indiscriminately, it can lead to exhaustion and death. </p>
<p>In cases of febrile disease, where there are only external symptoms without internal cold or heat, and the vital energy is intact, it is appropriate to primarily use the formula &quot;Zheng Chaihu Decoction.&quot; Additionally, formulas like &quot;Shishen Decoction&quot; and &quot;Shensu Decoction&quot; may also be considered. </p>
<p>If the disease is affecting the Yangming, one should use &quot;Shengma Gegen Decoction.&quot; In cases of seasonal epidemics causing body aches and fever, or in the presence of miasma, &quot;Baidu San&quot; or &quot;Jingfang Baidu San&quot; should be used. If the disease affects the three Yang channels, leading to headaches, nasal congestion, stiff neck, body aches, and cough, &quot;Shenzhusuan&quot; is advisable. For cases of wind-cold with fever and cough, &quot;Chai Chen Decoction&quot; or &quot;Jin Feicao San&quot; may be indicated, and in severe cases, &quot;Xiao Qinglong Decoction.&quot;<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>For those suffering from cold damage who should be treated with warming dispersions, this applies when the cold pathogen is predominant externally, and there is no internal heat, as well as when the original qi is intact and the qi is clear but affected by cold. In such cases, warming dispersions are appropriate, and the Er-Chai-Hu Decoction is the most suitable. If the cold is severe and the exterior is solid, the Ma-Gui Decoction is the most excellent choice, and there should be no doubt or fear. Additionally, formulas like Wu-Ji-San, Ma-Huang Decoction, Gui-Zhi Decoction, Xiao-Qing-Long Decoction, Ge-Gen Decoction, and Sheng-San-Zi can also be used as needed.</p>
<p>For those with cold damage who should be treated with cooling dispersions, this applies when there is external heat and internal heat, with a pulse presentation that is both vigorous and characterized by thirst and a preference for coolness, as well as when the original qi is strong and robust. In such cases, both cooling and dispersing approaches may be used, with the Er-Chai-Hu Decoction as the first choice, or alternatives like Jiu-Wei-Qiang-Huo Decoction, Chai-Ge-Jie-Ju Decoction, and in severe cases, Liu-Shen-Tong-Jie-San can also be used as needed. If there is heat both internally and externally leading to heat diarrhea, the Chai-Qin Decoction is recommended. If both the exterior and interior are hot and there are rashes, the Chai-Ge Decoction should be used.</p>
<p>For those with cold damage who require both nourishment and dispersion, this is due to insufficiency in the nutritive and protective qi and inadequate circulation of blood and qi.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Using medicine is like using troops; when the soldiers advance but the supplies are lacking, the troops will falter. Similarly, if we attack an illness but the vital energy is insufficient, the illness will relapse. Therefore, when treating the conditions caused by external pathogens, one must first address the root cause before the superficial symptoms; this is of utmost importance. </p>
<p>If the cold pathogen is within the nutritive level, with liver and spleen blood deficiency, and the pathogen&#39;s heat does not recede, one should use San Chai Hu Decoction or Gui Chai Decoction. If the cold pathogen is in the defensive level, with spleen and lung qi deficiency, and the exterior pathogen does not resolve, one should use Si Chai Hu Decoction. If there is insufficient spleen and stomach qi and blood, and the pathogen&#39;s heat does not resolve, one should use Wu Chai Hu Decoction. If the pathogenic influence is half-exterior and half-interior, with alternating cold and heat and slight qi deficiency, one should use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If there is extreme heat from warmth or summer, great thirst, with fluids depleted and unable to produce sweat due to yin deficiency, one should use Gui Ge Decoction. If the cold pathogen has penetrated deeply and the yang energy within the yin is insufficient, or there is severe cold in the back, it will be difficult to disperse; one must use a yin-cooking method. If there is great deficiency of central qi and extreme cold, with body heat and aversion to cold, or severe diarrhea with the exterior pathogen unresolved, one must use Da Wen Zhong Decoction.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p>
<h3>Method for Supplementing Deficiency</h3>
<p>Febrile diseases, like cold damage and epidemics, are both manifestations of external invasion; only those with internal excess can resist them. If one is affected but the evil cannot overcome the good, even in illness there’s no harm. The greatest fear lies with those who are internally deficient, for the good cannot withstand the evil, and the harmful influences will inevitably penetrate deeply, causing great damage. Thus it is said: &quot;Cold damage primarily harms the internally deficient.&quot; Furthermore, many people today are weak and deficient, while those who are strong and robust are few. If one were to encounter cold damage with underlying deficiency and not know to urgently address the root cause, the chance of survival is nearly nonexistent. Therefore, texts on cold damage state: &quot;Those with yang symptoms who have an阴脉 (yin pulse) will die,&quot; precisely because a yin pulse indicates deficiency. In distinguishing this, the pulse is primary, supplemented by physical signs, which ensures no error. Generally, when encountering cold damage or other heat-related symptoms, if the pulse appears weak, floating, and without strength upon pressure, this indicates deficiency; it is the most difficult to resolve and least appropriate to attack. Even if one wants to induce sweating, it is difficult for sweat to emerge. If some slight sweating occurs, it is merely forcing the skin to produce sweat, and it is certainly not something transformed through the nourishment of the ying and wei (nutritive and defensive) fluids. If one disregards the balance of deficiency and excess and pushes too hard, it will quickly exhaust the vital energy, leading to imminent danger. Thus, when treating deficiency, one must carefully observe the nuances of deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>If one is in a state of moderate deficiency, one must primarily focus on tonifying while also addressing the邪 (pathogenic factors). If one is in a state of severe deficiency, one should completely avoid treating the邪 and concentrate solely on restoring the fundamental essence. By focusing on the essence, one aims to preserve life; if life is sustained, the vital energy will gradually recover. It may take seven days, fourteen days, or even up to twenty days afterward for the vital energy to gain strength, and the邪 will naturally be defeated without any attack. When profuse sweating occurs, recovery will ensue. To understand the signs, one must also observe the pulse. If the weak becomes progressively stronger, the small becomes larger, the taut becomes smoother, and the tight becomes looser, then profuse sweating is imminent and a fortunate period is approaching. When employing tonification methods, one must observe the condition of the thorax and abdomen. If there is significant stagnation in the chest and abdomen, tonification should not be applied; if a person is young and has abundant energy, tonification should also be avoided. However, if the energy is inherently deficient and there is no stagnation in the chest and abdomen, one may boldly proceed with tonification.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>If there is no internal heat pathogen, it is advisable to use warmth. If there is a difficulty in the flow of Qi, then one must warm the stomach before it can recover. For to补 (tonify) is to acquire warmth and promote flow, while the pathogen, when warmed, disperses rapidly. One must not mix with depleting cold or cooling methods, as this would divide the strength of warming and tonification. If one is initially affected by a cold pathogen and shows true deficiency in pulse and symptoms indicating the pathogen is hard to disperse, then herbs like ginseng and cooked rehmannia should be used promptly—the sooner, the better. Delaying will only allow the thief (the pathogen) to delve deeper, making it harder to control. This is the best method for treating deficiency pathogens. I have used this method to save many lives. I have heard that some ignorant individuals avoid tonics for fear of cold damage, not realizing that tonification is meant to support the interior, which is indeed a great principle. Just as a cold pathogen comes from the outside like a thief, the vital essence is like citizens guarding the interior. Strong citizens enable a strong interior, and a strong interior is what guards against the external. To preserve the essential mechanism of life, this is the only key to protecting against pathogenic Qi. To insist on avoiding tonification is to mislead people, and nothing could be worse than this.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>I am therefore recounting this again here, as I have yet to fully grasp the methods for treating cold damage. Gradually using and becoming familiar with them, I am beginning to understand their subtleties. From now on, I know that there will be countless individuals who, without doubt, will accept my words and obtain life from me. </p>
<p>In cold damage, when the essence and blood are inherently weak, or when the yang energy within the yin is insufficient, the pulse is thin and weak, accompanied by a dislike of cold; one must greatly assist the true yin. Then, the yang will emerge from the yin, and the exterior pathogen can be rapidly resolved. It is best to prepare a formula that regulates the yin, adding ingredients like Chai Hu and Ma Huang, or adjusting according to the symptoms as needed. </p>
<p>If, after seven or eight days of cold damage, the pulse is rapid and weak, the spirit is cloudy, and there is fatigue, or restlessness and unease, if dispersing or clearing methods do not work and the pathogen cannot be resolved, then one should administer a large dose of a formula that regulates the yin, which is truly a revitalizing remedy. </p>
<p>If both qi and blood are deficient and the pathogen cannot be resolved, one should aim for a balanced tonification, primarily using the Five Blessings Drink, adjusting according to symptoms. Alternatively, one could use the Great Augmentation Decoction, Six Ingredients Decoction, or the Complete Great Tonifying Soup, all of which are permissible. </p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach qi is weak and the pathogen cannot be resolved, one should use a modified Si Jun Zi Decoction. If middle qi is weak, with cold in the spleen or accompanying nausea, and the pathogen cannot be resolved, one should consider the Five Jun Zi Decoction or Warm Stomach Drink. If fatigue damages the spleen, and cold pathogens invade, causing persistent fever, one should use the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction. If cold pathogens penetrate deeply, leading to yin deficiency and blood weakness that cannot manifest outwardly, but when ascending and dispersing is necessary, one should use the Yin-Supplementing and Qi-Boosting Decoction.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If there is yin deficiency with fever, a flushed face, thirst, restlessness, and a floating, rapid, and weak pulse, one should administer a large dose of Liu Wei Di Huang Tang, which can yield results after one dose. If there is a deficiency of central qi and the exterior pathogen does not resolve, or if one has developed a fear of medicine over time, or if various medicines have proven ineffective, then only Ren Shen Tang should be used. It may be thick or thin, hot or cold, according to the patient&#39;s preference, and it can be served as tea intermittently for consecutive days. This allows the nourishing qi to gradually recover, leading to the departure of pathogenic qi, resulting in significant restorative effects, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>The method of supplementation in treating cold damage differs from that of purging or dispersing. The purpose of purging and dispersing is to eliminate the substantial pathogen, demanding a forceful approach with swift effects; thus, when using herbs like Chai Hu or Ma Huang, results are expected within one to three doses, and with Da Huang or Mang Xiao, results can be seen after one dose. If there is no effect, it likely stems from improper use, and excessive application is unnecessary. In contrast, supplementation aims to restore deficiency, employing a gentler force with slower effects; thus, even if results are observed after one or two doses, it is common. However, if there is accumulated labor and severe deficiency of qi and blood, achieving restoration can be challenging. </p>
<p>One must observe whether taking supplements presents no issues, and if there is a slight correspondence between the pulse and symptoms, it indicates the power of supplementation is being obtained. For lighter cases, two to three doses may suffice, while for heavier cases, more than ten doses may be required to see results, leading to sweating and the retreat of pathogens for healing. If one does not understand this principle and expects immediate effects within one or two doses, it may lead to doubt and confusion, ultimately undermining the entire effort, which must be carefully considered.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Warming and Nourishing Method</strong></p>
<p>In treating febrile diseases such as typhoid, those methods that warm and nourish are appropriate because the cold evil stagnates, and Yang cannot overcome Yin. Without warmth, movement is not possible; without warmth, recovery cannot occur. If cold qi is in the channels, the evil is on the surface and a warming and dispersing method should be used, as previously described. If cold qi is in the organs, it indicates a deficiency of Yang; in this case, warming and nourishing should be applied, or simply warming in moderation. </p>
<p>However, when using warming methods, one must observe if the exterior feels hot while the interior is actually not warm; this signifies false heat, indicating a preference for warming over cooling. Even if the illness presents with heat, if the vital energy is deficient, it is still false heat, and thus, warmth is favored over coolness. True heat is easily recognized, but false heat is difficult to distinguish. If one suffers from false heat, failing to use sweet warmth will result in persistent fever, especially when true cold is also present, which is evident without further explanation. </p>
<p>Generally, true conditions often show true heat, while deficient conditions usually present false heat. Therefore, true ailments tend to be treated with cooling methods, while deficient ailments are commonly treated with warmth. Misidentifying the true and false forms of heat can lead to significant mistakes. Additionally, distinguishing between true cold and false heat entails recognizing that both true and false can manifest in cold and heat states.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If one says that all that is real is hot and all that is empty is cold, then they are mistaken. However, things that are real and cold should only be warmed and scattered, not necessarily nourished; things that are empty and hot should only be regulated and replenished, and are most afraid of cold. Cold is lifeless and can easily damage the vital energy. If one treats empty conditions with cold, then heat may not necessarily subside, and although it may be bearable temporarily, in the long run, it will surely harm the spleen and lead to danger. </p>
<p>Having already suffered from heat, it is also inappropriate to use cold; thus, it can be generally stated that it is a false heat, which is not excessive. In cases of cold damage with fever and a deficiency of the kidney’s yang, or experiencing aversion to cold, body ache, vomiting, or dysentery, with a weak pulse and qi deficiency that cannot resolve the exterior, one must use great warming middle decoction or treat with yin regulating ingredients. If the cold damage presents with body heat and the heart and lungs are cold, or with cough and vomiting, or abdominal fullness with wheezing, where there is merely cold evil without deficiency, small Qinglong decoction should be used. If there is cold damage with yin symptoms, presenting with deep pulse, body aches, fever, abdominal pain, and reverse cold, but only cold evil without deficiency of vital energy, warming medicine should be used, preferably with the Si Ni decoction. If there is cold in the Taiyin and symptoms including abdominal pain with vomiting and diarrhea, or bloating and reverse cold, with spleen and stomach deficiency and unresolved evil, then warming stomach decoction or regulating middle decoction should be used.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If typhoid lasts one or two days, with the pathogen in the Yangming or Shaoyin, accompanied by a severe cold in the back while the exterior remains unresolved, one should use the Fuzi Liyin decoction. In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s case, he employed the Fuzi Decoction. If there is wind-cold on the surface, with internal cold causing heat in the body, while internals are experiencing persistent diarrhea, possibly accompanied by vomiting or abdominal pain, this indicates that the vital energy is leaking out and the external pathogen is deeply entrenched, resulting in an inability to resolve the condition. In such cases, one should promptly use the Weiguan Decoction or a Great Warming Decoction. In all cases of typhoid accompanying significant Yin and Yang deficiency, with the vital energy on the brink of collapse and the pathogen remaining unresolved, the Liu Wei Hui Yang Decoction is essential. However, if there is merely a sense of major deficiency and cold, one should administer this immediately; waiting until defeat occurs may lead to irreversible consequences.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>When Yin is excessive and separates from Yang, resulting in true internal cold and false external heat, the symptoms will certainly be a red head and flushed face, possibly accompanied by dry thirst and a scorched tongue, mouth sores or throat pain, agitation and panting, body heat like fire, or the appearance of spots and mosquito bites all over the body, or the urine being yellow like gold. Although there are these external symptoms, the pulse will be weak and not strong, and there may be nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, a fear of cold in the back and abdomen, shortness of breath like panting, confusion and unconsciousness, anxiety and fear, or despite feeling hot there is no thirst, or even speaking in a delirious manner while breathing is shallow and faint, or the body may be agitated yet movements are weak; if controlled, they will stop. All of these are signs of internal deficiency with external excess, true cold and false heat, and treatment must include prescriptions to nourish Yin, such as the Six Flavor Rehmannia Decoction, Great Warming Middle Decoction, or Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction, in large doses for preservation. </p>
<p>If there is floating fire, with throat pain and a dry tongue that can&#39;t tolerate hot drinks, use water from a well to soak the herbs, and drink it cold. This employs the flavor of false cold to resolve the false heat of the upper burner and the true heat to salvage the true cold of the lower burner, a method to revive the Yang and restore life, truly magical. For those with a deficiency of blood and the vital energy, use nourishing strategies. However, if warming tonics are administered in excess and the illness becomes increasingly confused, along with restlessness and heat that is difficult to relieve, it indicates that the Yang evil is solely excessive and the Yin energy is not adequate, thus there is heat within the deficiency. </p>
<p>In this case, modify to nourish Yin, using Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction combined with Scutellaria and Ophiopogon, or a Chai Hu Decoction with Anemarrhena, among similar formulations. This method of ten remedies to nourish and one to clear is effective with just one dose, its efficacy is truly miraculous. It is crucial for physicians to be agile and knowledgeable in this.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p>
<h3>Principles of Purging</h3>
<p>In treating epidemic fever, it is essential to clear and purify, which is not limited to just one approach. Generally, if there is excess heat, it is advisable to clear the heat; if there is excess qi, it is appropriate to move the qi; if there is food stagnation, it is necessary to resolve the food; if there is phlegm accumulation, it should be transformed. All of these methods fall under the category of clearing and purging. When these issues are resolved, the stagnation dissipates, allowing the qi to flow and the external evils to resolve themselves. However, these methods should be employed primarily for excess conditions and are not suitable for deficiency syndromes. In cases where there is a combination of deficiency with some excess, it is acceptable to use them sparingly. The key lies in discerning the appropriate measure. If the condition is critical, there should be no room for error. If one inappropriately uses clearing methods when they should not be applied, it is akin to striking a dying flame. </p>
<p>For cases of high fever in epidemic fever, the treatment should be to clear and resolve. When heat enters the Yangming stage, causing thirst, agitation, and a strong pulse with persistent evil, it is appropriate to use the Chai Hu Bai Hu Decoction, or simply Bai Hu Decoction, Tai Qing Drink, or Yu Quan Powder; if there is still heat after sweating, these remedies should also be used. If there is thirst, agitation, and red spots, with a strong yet weak pulse, Ren Shen Bai Hu Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>If the cold pathogen is in the Taiyang (greater yang) stage, presenting with fever, headache, a surging pulse, and the exterior evil has not yet resolved, while internal heat is severe, one should use Chai Hu Decoction, or San Huang Shi Gao Decoction, or Liu Shen Tong Jie San. If the six channels are in a state of heat and the fire evil is unresolved, accompanied by manic rashes and restlessness, or a red face and dry mouth with a dark tongue, and a surging, static pulse, one should consider Chou Qin Decoction, or Huang Lian Jie Du Tang, or add Chai Hu. If the cold damage has penetrated into the blood chamber, resulting in vomiting, nosebleeds, yellow rashes, and blood heat and dryness, and the ability to sweat is lost while the evil persists, one should use the prescription of Xie Jiao Di Huang Decoction; if the heat is severe, use the Liang Fang Xie Jiao Di Huang Decoction. If heat evil obstructs the blood aspect, causing constipation and inability to resolve the evil, one should use the Ba Cui Xie Jiao Di Huang Decoction. If the Shaoyin water is depleted, Yangming fire is flourishing, leading to thirst, loss of blood, toothache, and constipation, with an empty pulse leading to wheezing while the evil cannot be resolved, one should use the Yu Nu Decoction. If the Yang evil of cold is excessive and the blood vessels are blocked, resulting in cold extremities, this is termed heat collapse; one should use Si Ni San.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>If during the hot months a plague arises, and both inside and outside are hot, one should use Qianghuo Shengma Decoction to clear and resolve it. If there is a chill plague causing hot blockage in the bladder with difficulty urinating, and the fire pathogen does not recede, or if there is accompanying heat diarrhea, one should use Dafen Qingyin, or Chaiqing Decoction, or Yiyuan Powder. If there is a chill plague with strong internal heat, difficulty urinating, and thirst accompanied by heat and yellow color, one should use Yinchendrink, or Dafen Qingyin. In cases of intense plague heat where thirst is uneasy, it is best to provide snow pear juice at intervals, as it is excellent for quenching thirst and reducing heat, far superior to Yiyuan Powder. Regarding cold water, which has a natural characteristic of heavenly quality, being sweet and not bitter, it is particularly effective at clearing heat, alleviating restlessness, nourishing yin, and strengthening fluids. In instances of intense fire causing depletion of fluids, leading to great thirst and blockage of defense and nutrition, where sweating cannot be induced, this would be most suitable.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Although symptoms of deficiency are not to be used, there are still cases that warrant treatment. One should observe if the throat is extremely hot, the lips and tongue are dry and scorched, and there is constipation along with a great thirst for cold. This indicates a deficiency of yin and a loss of fluids. In such cases, it is appropriate to use ginseng, cooked rehmannia, cinnamon, aconite, and dried ginger in combination for nourishing yin, which can be quite effective. However, if there is no constipation and only mild heat and slight thirst due to fatigue or yang deficiency, these remedies should be avoided. Misuse can lead to chills and worsened condition.</p>
<p>For cases of cold damage with mixed symptoms, the treatment should focus on harmonizing and clearing. For cold damage accompanied by wind, with fever, cough, and excessive phlegm, Chai-Chen Decoction is advised. If stagnation in food causes an obstruction in the stomach while the exterior remains unresolved, Da-Hua-Zhong drink with Chaihu should be used. If one is affected by the cold dampness of the seasons, leading to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, or symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating, Pingwei Powder is appropriate. If there is significant cold causing frequent vomiting, Hewei Drink is recommended. If externally contracted wind-cold leads to internal stagnation of food, accompanied by headaches, alternating chills and fever, or symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating, Huo-Xiang Zheng-Qi Powder should be administered. </p>
<p>For cases of seasonal cold dampness with fever, jaundice, body aches, and tight pulse, along with cold diarrhea and difficulty urinating, Chai-Ling Decoction is suitable. If there is a lack of cold but an abundance of fire internally, Chai-Ling Soup is indicated. For cases of heat from external injury causing cholera-like diarrhea, difficulty urinating, abdominal pain, and bloating with internal yin and exterior yang conditions, Wu-Ling Powder is the remedy. For external injury from cold and dampness resulting in pain throughout the body, Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction should be used.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p>
<h3>Vomiting Therapy</h3>
<p>For cases of febrile diseases where vomiting is advisable, it is essential that there is stagnation in the upper jiao, whether caused by food or phlegm, leading to a blockage in the chest and diaphragm, preventing the邪 (evil) from dispersing; in such cases, vomiting should be performed. If there is cold邪 and turbid qi penetrating into the diaphragm, resulting in distension or pain, vomiting should also be done. The act of vomiting inherently expresses a principle of dispersing. However, if there is a deficiency of middle qi with cold, a weak and powerless pulse, or symptoms of shortness of breath accompanied by restlessness, then vomiting must not be performed. </p>
<p>When using emetic medicines, one should stop at the moment the illness begins to improve; it is not necessary to expel everything. Ancient methods of emesis predominantly utilized the Dusheng Powder and tea adjustments. Any stagnation in the upper jiao can be treated with these. However, the new methods of vomiting are regarded as more efficient. Additionally, all medicines can be used for vomiting; one merely needs to prepare the medicinal decoction according to the symptoms, take it for a short while, then knead and vomit, allowing for a tailored approach based on severity and symptomatology, which is particularly effective.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Alternatives for Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage or epidemics where purging is indicated, it is essential that there is an obstruction in the Yangming channel due to excess in the bowels, leading to secreted accumulation and abdominal fullness, before initiating purgation. If the patient has inherently strong vital energy and a robust stomach, purging can also be considered. However, if there has been no bowel movement for several days, yet the abdomen is not distended, and there are no signs of constipation or blockage, and if the patient has not eaten for consecutive days but the abdomen remains relaxed and unobstructed, it indicates that the Yangming stomach and bowels are not truly obstructed by excess, and care must be taken to avoid reckless purging that could deplete the interior energy. Furthermore, the rules against purging in cases of cold damage should be heeded carefully, so as not to misapply treatment. Misjudgments in this regard can have particularly severe consequences. Although there may be instances where some physicians recklessly administer purgatives without causing death, it is likely because the patient’s vital energy is naturally strong enough to withstand the effects of purging. Relying on such examples as justification could result in fatal outcomes.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>If the cold evil enters the Yangming and there are symptoms of constipation, delirium, fullness in the abdomen, and a firm pulse, then it is advisable to use Da Cheng Qi Decoction or adjust it with Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Decoction. If the exterior symptoms of the cold have not been resolved but there is an urgency in the interior, and both the exterior and interior are firm, Da Chai Hu Decoction should be used. If there is a blockage of heat evil in the three jiaos and six meridians, with constipation and unresolved exterior symptoms, then the prescribed Liang Ge San should be administered. If the cold and heat evil has penetrated the interior leading to deficiency of both qi and blood, then Tao&#39;s Huang Long Decoction is appropriate. If the heat evil has penetrated the interior while there is blood deficiency causing blockage with abdominal distention and pain, and the evil cannot be resolved, then Wu Zhu San should be used. If there is a widespread epidemic causing heat with internal fire accumulation in the three jiaos, resulting in constipation and the evil cannot be dispelled, then Wu Wen Dan is recommended. If there is an epidemic causing fever, with floating heat on the surface and heat accumulation in the chest, Da Qing Wan should be used. For all conditions that require purging or laxation, one should follow the symptoms and administer Bai Shun Wan in quantities of one, two, or three qian, as it is the most swift and excellent remedy.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Differentiation and Treatment of Epidemic Heat Toxins</strong></p>
<p>Epidemics fundamentally correspond to typhoid fever, but they can have slight differences. They often occur in spring and summer, and due to the prevailing climate, they manifest similarly in severity. One must wait until the disease has run its course before sweating can alleviate it; this is the hallmark of an epidemic. Although ancient methods state that epidemic illnesses are more prevalent in the three yang channels and less so in the three yin, one should not be overly rigid in this classification. If one observes symptoms of yin and the pulse is yin, this indicates a three yin disease and should be clearly differentiated and treated.</p>
<p>For epidemics in the three yang channels, one must discern their respective pathways. If the pulse is floating, with a headache, fever, and body aches, this is a Taiyang syndrome; treat it with a modified version of the Nine-Flavor Qianghuo Decoction. If the pulse is long, the nose is dry, and there is insomnia with restlessness, this indicates a Yangming syndrome; treat it with Ge Gen Jie Mu Decoction or a modified version of the Ten-Flavor Ren Su Decoction. If the pulse is wiry and rapid, accompanied by chest and flank pain and deafness, this is a Shaoyang syndrome; treat it with a modified version of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. This approach to treating the three yang channels is a key aspect of ancient methods for addressing epidemics.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>However, this evidence of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess is all-encompassing, and it should still be treated as before, without being rigidly adhered to. When an epidemic first arises with symptoms of headache and body aches, aversion to cold and fever, a tight and rapid pulse, and no other symptoms, it is advisable to use Chai Hu Decoction, or Bai Du San, or Shi Shen Tang. If the epidemic begins with more yin and less yang, and the pulse shows no deficiency, Shen Zhu San should be used. If there is fullness and oppression in the chest due to the epidemic, Xiao Chai Hu Tang should be modified with Zhi Shi and Ju Hong; if there is internal heat, add Huang Lian. In hot months when epidemics occur, with both exterior and interior heat being severe, it is appropriate to use Qiang Huo Sheng Ma Decoction to clear heat and resolve toxins. If the epidemic exhibits strong fire symptoms, with a large and rapid pulse and severe agitation, San Huang Shi Gao Tang should be used. If the heat and toxins from the epidemic rise, causing swelling in the head and face, inability to open the eyes, dryness of the mouth and tongue, and difficulty swallowing, Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin is recommended. If the epidemic presents with a large and rapid pulse, causing agitation and thirst, Bai Hu Tang is suitable; or if there are accompanying symptoms of vomiting, use Zhong Jing Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>If the plague causes rampant delirium, with a pulse that is surging, large, and slippery, and if there is constipation, one should use the Da Cheng Qi Decoction or the Jizi Qing Drink. If the plague has both internal and external solid pathogens and there is constipation, one should use the Fang Feng Tong Sheng San to resolve conditions both inside and out. If the plague lingers for eight to nine days without resolving, with rashes and yellowing in the skin, but the pulse is neither weak nor floating and the abdomen feels distended, one should generally combine the Da Cheng Qi Decoction and the Wu Ling San to promote a bowel movement. If the plague presents with redness in the head and body, extreme heat in the limbs, and restlessness that is unbearable, one should use methods to resolve the plague&#39;s heat toxins, drink inner snow pear juice, or mix Jinghua water with Yuquan Powder, all of which are excellent. The above methods are tailored to the situation and symptoms, suitable for Yang patterns with solid pathogens.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>If the epidemic shows weak and powerless pulses, or appears solid externally but is empty internally, or if one dislikes cold drinks and experiences loose stools, it is not a yang condition. One must not hastily conclude it is fire due to fever and rapid pulse, even in the summer months. Treatments such as Li Zhong Tang, Li Yin Jian, Da Wen Zhong Yin, Da Bu Yuan Jian, and other warming methods should be applied according to the specific symptoms; this is the subtle method of adapting treatment to the condition rather than the time. Furthermore, summer months are particularly rife with hidden yin, so for every case of this nature, one must first assess yin and yang, and then distinguish between deficiency and fullness; this is essential. It is crucial to recognize this!</p>
<p>Xu Donggao said: If the epidemic does not resolve after six or seven days, and heat enters the blood chamber causing yellowing, the body feels as if it has been smoked, the eyes appear golden, the mouth is dry and hot with hardened stools, then one should use a needle to prick the cubital region to expel bad blood, along with using Tong Sheng San combined with a purgative, achieving sweating like yellow water and stools like black grease for recovery. This is what is referred to in the North as &quot;striking the cold.&quot; The method involves using the hand to stroke the upper arm to gather blood to the arm, securing it with a cloth, then using chopsticks to pinch the magnetic ridge, striking and pricking the large collaterals beside the elbow&#39;s curve, allowing the pathogenic toxins to exit alongside the bad blood; this is also the most effective method. The impoverished have found it highly effective, yet it is not specifically at the point of Qu Chi.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Big Head Pestilence</strong></p>
<p>The Big Head Pestilence is caused by the malevolent toxins of heaven affecting the channels of the three Yangs, resulting in a hatred of cold, fever, swelling of the head, neck, or throat, and even redness of the cheeks and face, with swelling of the shoulders and back, resembling a toad; hence it is also known as Toad Pestilence. Generally, this condition is mostly due to wind-heat, but there can be distinctions between superficial and internal deficiencies or excesses. There are also times when external toxic conditions manifest as this.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment methods for Big Head Toad Pestilence:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>When the illness is localized in the head and internal heat is not excessive, the first approach should be to disperse it, using Chai Hu decoction or Bai Du San. </li>
<li>If the throat is swollen and painful due to the current toxin, with moderate internal heat and smooth adjustments, Ge Gen Niu Bang Tang is appropriate. </li>
<li>When the external and internal heat are both present, with swelling in the head and neck, and clearance along with dispersion is needed, use Chai Ge Decoction. </li>
<li>If the current toxin in the Yangming is causing both external and internal heat with severe headaches and nasal dryness, a dispersing approach is suitable with Chai Ge Jie Ji Tang. </li>
<li>If the current toxin in the three Yangs is extremely hot and tumultuous, with swollen and painful throat, a combined approach of clearing and dispersing is recommended with Zhi Zi Ren Tang.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>If there is widespread toxicity causing邪热 to rise, resulting in swelling of the head and face and difficulty in the throat, the remedy is Puji Xiaodu Decoction. If the毒风热 gathers in the head and face, leading to elevation and dispersal issues, Rhinoceros Horn and Cimicifuga Decoction is recommended. If there is a prevailing气 that requires clearing heat and resolving toxicity, Qianghuo and Cimicifuga Decoction should be used. If there are symptoms of toxic blood heat, agitation, and red patches, you may use Rhinoceros Horn Powder or Ginseng and Baihu Decoction. If both internal and external toxicity are strong and a dual resolution is required, Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder is appropriate. If the toxicity causes burning, swelling, and pain, with a strong pulse and constipation, it’s necessary to clear the bowels with Wuli Dahuang Decoction, or use Leolu and Cimicifuga Decoction, or Lianqiao Xiaodu Powder. If the toxicity is severe but there is external strength and internal weakness, with a weak pulse and fatigue, any signs of deficiency should be addressed. You must support the interior, using Renqi Tori Powder or Tori Xiaodu Powder. If there is Yang deficiency posing as false heat, along with vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea, remedies like Liuwei Huayang Decoction are essential and should not be doubted. If the swelling and pain in the head and neck are severe and intolerable, use Qingliang Jiukushu Powder for external application, or prepare a paste from the juice of natural Platycladus leaves mixed with earthworm mud.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Initial Concepts of Treatment</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case of illness, whether due to cold, plague, or fever, there is invariably a rise in temperature. However, at the onset of an illness, when the pathogenic influence is still on the surface and has not penetrated inward or reached the state of congested heat, although there may be a fever at the surface, it is merely due to cold pathogens affecting the skin and layers without the presence of internal fire. How can this be considered a yang condition? At this time, one should only use warming and dispersing methods, perhaps also incorporating mild purging, with the medication tailored to the condition, and it will surely lead to immediate recovery. Yet, unfortunately, the conventional doctors of the time see a fever and immediately assume it to be fire, indiscriminately using herbs like qin, lian, and zhu, not realizing that there is no real heat within. How can such a method be appropriate? If cold pathogens are treated with cold medicines, both the exterior and interior become colder, and if there is no resolution, it will lead to an inward transmission of the cold within days. The reckless use of cold and cooling methods results in the continual decline of the vital yang, causing much loss of life. When this principle is not understood, one becomes oblivious to the conditions of the exterior and interior, as well as the order of treatment. Throughout their lives, they fail to recognize this, often leading others astray, and yet they dare to speak confidently about medicine. Can their hearts truly find peace in such arrogance?<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Dietary Recommendations and Prohibitions</p>
<p>In matters of diet, there are things that are advisable and things that should be avoided. For those suffering from a cold or fever who cannot stop eating, this indicates that external pathogens are still superficial and have not yet penetrated deeply. As the condition deepens and rests between the superficial and the interior, appetite gradually diminishes. Once the pathogens reach the chest and stomach, one may completely lose the desire to eat. If the pathogen resides in the stomach, one will not feel hungry; thus, in cases of cold, the lack of appetite may last for ten or even twenty days without significant concern, as the stomach’s qi is not depleted. However, if one does not wish to eat, they should not be forced; doing so will support the pathogen. After recovery, when the stomach qi is starting to awaken, it is especially important not to indulge in food, as overindulgence may lead to a relapse. These are all critical prohibitions. As for those who must avoid certain foods, such as individuals with internal injuries due to overwork who happen to catch a cold, they will also likely develop a fever; this is primarily due to damage to the middle qi and not from genuine internal invasion by an external cold pathogen. Therefore, although they may exhibit a fever, they often feel hunger and have a strong desire for food.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>How lamentable that the ignorant, upon sensing a fever, declare it to be merely hunger or a cold, without discerning the true nature of the illness, and they indiscriminately impose prohibitions against eating. Those who are hungry often find their requests unmet and are further subjected to harsh medicines that expel cold and dampness. Alas! The hungry bellies suffer, the weak become weaker, and with attacks from both inside and out, they endure suffering without recourse. When the stomach energy has already diminished, they no longer desire food. Even if one wishes to save them, it becomes impossible. </p>
<p>I often treat this condition by using food as medicine, having saved many lives, yet I have also witnessed many perish due to the prohibition of food, so I speak of this matter in detail. If a patient constantly feels hungry and seeks food, it indicates that the pathogen is not within the organs but rather that the stomach is empty; thus, it must not be prohibited, though it should not be indulged excessively. This is crucial for discerning the true condition of the patient and must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Chao said: In the case of those recovering from an epidemic illness, when the spleen and stomach are still weak and the energy of grains has not yet returned, engaging in excessive activity and consuming fatty meats such as pork, lamb, chicken, fish, as well as hard-to-digest fruits and starchy foods will lead to stagnation in the stomach and intestines, causing bloating and constipation, or severe vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in a recurrence of fever, making the illness incurable. </p>
<p>Avoidance of Epidemic Method.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Pestilence is the malevolent energy of heaven and earth. If a person&#39;s inner vital energy is strong and upright, then this malevolent force cannot interfere, and one will not be contaminated. Therefore, the method to avoid it lies in moderation in desires and fatigue. Particularly after sexual activity and fatigue, one should keep their distance and avoid enduring hunger to receive its energy; these are essential practices. </p>
<p>As for methods to repel malevolence, as mentioned in the discussion on puncturing, the heavenly energy should continuously return. The energy emanates from the brain, thus not touching the malevolence. The &quot;heavenly energy&quot; refers to the nose, which receives the energy of heaven, hence it is called the heavenly conduit. The energy comes empty and also wishes to leave empty; thus, the heavenly energy continuously returns. </p>
<p>Since energy communicates with the nose, and the nose connects to the brain, if poison enters the brain, it spreads throughout the channels, causing contamination. When energy issues from the brain, one can sneeze or open the nose to release it. If one absorbs energy from a room, then expels it outward while deeply inhaling fresh energy, the malevolent force will escape through the nose, dissipating the toxic energy; this is the method to repel malevolence externally. </p>
<p>Additionally, practices such as visualizing the mind as the sun belong to the Gallbladder, which is affiliated with the Lesser Yang, serving as the central and upright official. When the Lesser Yang energy is strong, the energy of the organs is similarly robust, and thus malevolence cannot enter; this is a method of forcefully resisting malevolence from within. </p>
<p>In all matters of visiting relatives or diagnosing ailments, should circumstances require action, just knowing these methods enables one to remain untroubled even in the dirtiest places. One remedy for dealing with seasonal ailments and strange phenomena in dwellings is to burn Zheng Zhen incense, which greatly dispels malevolence and filth. It is also effective for children to carry it, as it can resolve various evils.

<p>The signs of epidemics have no fixed origins, yet there are reasons behind their summoning. It may arise from disturbances in human affairs, deviations in the elemental forces of nature, the contamination from corpses, or the transformation and emission of toxic vapors—all of which can lead to epidemic diseases. Since the manifestations differ, the treatments cannot be unified. However, those afflicted by epidemics mostly harbor a heated energy; when contained within a household, the entire family suffers, when concentrated in a village, the whole community suffers, and when gathered in a marketplace, an entire city suffers; if amassed along roadways, countless distances may fall ill. Thus, while the symptoms vary, addressing the heated energy and minimizing the addition of products meant to expel evils and impurities has proven effective for all. </p>
<p>The formula employs five qian of Yuan Shen, three qian each of Da Huang, Mai Dong, Bai Shao, Hua Fen, two qian of Shi Gao, and one qian each of Chai Hu and Jing Jie, to be boiled in water for consumption. This formula can universally treat epidemic diseases, with adjustments made as needed, all effects are beneficial. The essence of this formula lies in using Da Huang to cleanse the evils from the chest and abdomen, employing Jing Jie and Chai Hu to disperse the mixed external and internal pathogenic energies, employing Tian Hua Fen to eliminate phlegm and resolve blockages, using Shi Gao to eliminate the fire within the stomach, and employing Bai Shao to calm the liver&#39;s wood energy, preventing it from overwhelming the spleen&#39;s earth energy, thereby sustaining the righteous energy and expelling the evil energy. This formula is the most suitable and miraculous for those treating epidemics, serving as a secret kept close.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Complete Collection of Medical Works from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 300</strong></p>

<p><strong>Recipe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tusu Wine</strong>: This is a recipe from “Qianjin Prescription.” It dispels pestilential energy, preventing one from contracting warm diseases and typhoid fever. On New Year&#39;s Day, make Tusu wine as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>15 zhū of rhubarb </li>
<li>18 zhū each of white atractylodes and cassia </li>
<li>50 zhū each of platycodon and Sichuan pepper </li>
<li>12 zhū of peony root </li>
<li>6 zhū of aconite</li>
</ul>
<p>The above seven ingredients are to be ground and placed in a red bag. On the night of the last day of the twelfth month, suspend this bag in a well until it becomes muddy. On the first day of the first month, retrieve the medicine early in the morning, and decoct it several times in the wine, then drink it in a room facing east. </p>
<p>For Tusu wine, start with a small quantity, adjusting the amount freely. If one person drinks, there will be no pestilence in that household; if an entire household drinks, there will be no pestilence in that neighborhood. If the medicated wine is consumed for three mornings, the dregs should be placed back in the well. If it is drunk again the following year, one can live without illness. </p>
<p>All wells inside and outside the home should be treated with this medicine to dispel pestilential energy. There is also an alternative recipe that includes one liang of siler.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Taiyi Liu Jin San dispels warm qi.<br>Xiong Huang (realgar) three taels, ci huang (orpiment), antelope horn burnt, each two taels; alum, ghost arrow feathers, each one and a half tael.

<p>In the second year of Han Jian Ning, when the Tai Sui was in the You month, a plague spread, and many people died. A scholar named Ding Jihui came from Qingcheng Mountain in Shu. Upon passing through Nanyang and entering through the west city gate, he saw many afflicted by the plague. He then took out medicine from his pouch and gave each person one pill. The miraculous medicine touched their lips, and there was no illness that did not heal. </p>
<p>In the market, there were hundreds of plague spirits; seeing the scholar administering medicine, they all fled in fear. Then a spirit king approached the scholar and sought to learn his method, moved by the way he dispensed the medicine that made the other spirits flee. The scholar replied: &quot;I have no special method, only the medicine in my pouch.&quot; Upon seeing the medicine, the spirit king grew alarmed, bowed his head, and fled for his life.</p>

<p>The Holy Powder is discussed by Su Neihan, who mentions a time he examined the “Thousand Gold,” which describes various powdered prescriptions and claims to have no limits in curing diseases. Sun Simiao particularly highlighted that this prescription uses medicinal materials with an unusual balance, effective in emergency situations and producing remarkable results.

<p>Historically, discussions on illness indicate that typhoid fever is the gravest threat; the signs and symptoms vary daily, and if treatment differs by a tiny margin, one may not survive. When poisons are in circulation, using the Holy Powder can address any illness without concern for yin or yang. It should be taken continuously without comparison to typhoid fever. When an outbreak occurs, at dawn, boil a pot, not discerning age or status, and use one large cup for everyone, so that none will be afflicted. If taken on an empty stomach during normal health, it ensures hearty meals and prevents all diseases, serving as a treasure for protecting lives and families.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The formula is one that is not known for its origin, yet the esteemed physician, Lord Chao, treasured it as a precious remedy for treating epidemics, achieving a remarkable success rate.

Initially, Lord Chao was very reluctant to share this formula, swearing an oath by the river and agreeing not to pass it on to others.

<p>Guidance</p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; the discussion on acupuncture methods addresses the prevention of transmission in an epidemic chamber. The Emperor said: I have heard that when five epidemics arrive, they easily transmit among each other, regardless of severity, and the symptoms are similar; if no treatment is applied, how can one avoid contagion? Qibo replied: To avoid contagion, one must preserve the righteous qi within, so that evil cannot invade, thus avoiding its toxic influence. The celestial essence has always existed and can return to its original state. </p>
<p>The qi emanates from the brain, preventing interference. When the qi flows from the brain, first focus your thoughts as if the heart were like the sun. When entering an epidemic chamber, first visualize the blue qi emanating from the liver, moving left towards the east, transforming into trees; next, visualize the white qi from the lungs, moving right towards the west, transforming into weaponry; then, visualize the red qi from the heart, moving south above, transforming into flames; next, visualize the black qi from the kidneys, moving north below, transforming into water; finally, visualize the yellow qi from the spleen, residing in the center, transforming into earth. By completing the protection of the five qís, visualize them above your head, like the brilliance of the Big Dipper, then one may enter the epidemic chamber.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　凡饮食有宜忌者，有不宜忌者。若病伤寒而食不断者，以邪犹在表，未深入也；及其稍深而在半表半里之间，则食渐减矣；再入胸膈胃口，则全不食矣。邪既在胃，则胃口不饥，所以伤寒不食者，或十日或二十日，皆无足虑者，亦以胃气不馁则不败也。但不欲食者，不可强食，强食则助邪。或新愈之后，胃气初醒，尤不可纵食，纵食则食复。此皆大忌也。至有不宜忌者，则如劳倦内伤之人，偶感寒邪，亦必发热，此多以劳伤中气，本非真正伤寒外邪内陷之病，所以外虽发热，而内则饥馁，每多思食。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>奈何庸昧之辈，但见发热则曰饿不死伤寒，不论虚实，一概禁之。常见欲食者，索之不得，而且加以克伐寒凉之药，嗟嗟！饥肠受剥，虚者益虚，内外夹攻，苦无所诉，及胃气既脱，反不欲食矣。即欲救之，已无可及。予常治此证，每借食为药，所活多人，而见禁食受毙者，亦已不少，故详言之。若病人时时觉饥而索食者，此其邪不在脏，胃中空虚而然，必不可禁，但不宜纵耳。且因此可察虚实，关系非小，不可忽也。　　巢氏曰：凡瘟疫病新瘥，脾胃尚虚，谷气未复，若作劳妄动伤力，并食猪羊鸡犬鱼脍、炙煿肥腻、生果面食硬濇难消之物，停积肠胃，膈闷腹胀便秘，或大吐大下，重复发热，病作不可救矣。<br>　　　　　避疫法<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p>
<p>　　瘟疫乃天地之邪气，若人身正气内固，则邪不可干，自不相染。故避之之法，惟在节欲节劳。或于房室劳倦之后，尤不可近，仍勿忍饥以受其气，皆要法也。至于却邪之法，则如刺法论所云：天牝从来，复得其往。气出于脑，即不干邪。盖天牝者鼻也，鼻受天之气，故曰天牝。气自空虚而来，亦欲其自空虚而去，即天牝从来，复得其往也。正以气通于鼻，鼻通于脑，毒入脑中，则流布诸经，令人相染矣。气出于脑，谓嚏之，或张鼻以泄之。或受气于室，则泄气于外，而大吸精气以易之，则邪从鼻出而毒气自散，此却邪于外之法也。又如想心如日等法，盖胆属少阳，为中正之官，少阳气壮则脏气赖以俱壮，而邪不能入，此强中御邪之法也。凡探亲诊疾，事有不容已者，但知此诸法，则虽入最秽之地，自可保其无虑。一方治天行时气，宅舍怪异，用降真香烧焚，大解邪秽，小儿带之，能解诸邪，最验。一法，以福建香茶饼不时噙口中，大辟伤寒瘴气秽恶。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>

<p>　　瘟疫之证，其来无方，然而召之亦有其故。或人事之错乱，或天时之乖违，或尸气之缠染，或毒气之变蒸，皆能成瘟疫之病也。证既不同，治难画一。然而瘟疫之人，大多火热之气，蕴蓄于房户则一家俱病，蕴蓄于村落则一乡俱病，蕴蓄于市廛则一城俱病，蓄畜于道路则千里皆病。故证虽多，但去其火热之气，而少加祛邪逐秽之品，未有不奏功效者也。方用元参五钱，大黄、麦冬、白芍、滑石、花粉各三钱，石膏二钱，柴胡、荆芥各一钱，水煎服。此方可通治瘟疫之病，出入加减，无不奏功。此方之妙，用大黄以荡涤胸腹之邪，用荆芥、柴胡以散其半表半里之邪气，用天花粉以消痰去结，用石膏以逐其胃中之火，用芍药以平肝木，不使来克脾土，则正气自存而邪气自出。此方最妥最神，治瘟疫者，以此为枕中秘。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>古今图书集成医部全录卷三百</p>

<p>Epidemic Disease</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the symptoms of illnesses among people of different ages often appear similar, and this is termed an epidemic disease. There are irregular influences in all seasons. Spring and summer can have cold and clear times, while autumn and winter may experience warm and hot periods. When people are affected by the harmful influences of the epidemic, illnesses occur similarly across ages during the year, described as the seasonal influence, commonly referred to as &quot;heavenly movement.&quot; </p>
<p>Old Master’s Divine Spirit Powder, Wu Chengzi’s Firefly Pills, Saint Powder, and Expel Toxin Powder are all used. If spring should be warm but clear energy is suppressed, then the evil is blamed on the liver; if summer should be hot but cold energy is suppressed, it is attributed to the heart; if autumn should be cool but strong heat is suppressed, it points to the lungs; if winter should be cold but strong warmth is suppressed, then it concerns the kidneys. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states: The poison of winter warmth differs greatly from that of cold damage. Indeed, cold damage arises from the influence of cold; winter warmth results from being affected by warm energy; cold epidemics are caused by sudden cold shocks, not due to exposure. Their treatment methods differ, as do the cold, heat, warmth, and coolness of the remedies applied. It cannot be strictly bound by days; sweating, vomiting, and purging must be executed according to symptoms. </p>
<p>In summary, treat heat with cold and administer warmth; treat warmth with clarity and apply coolness; treat cold with heat and administer coolness; treat clarity with warmth and apply heat. Aim for balance, without excess; this is the fundamental approach.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Warming Illness</strong></p>
<p>Before the summer solstice, if one experiences fever and aversion to cold, headache, and body aches, with a floating and tight pulse, this is called warming illness. If winter is hurt by the cold, those who are slightly affected can develop warming illness before the summer solstice, mainly due to the warm energy of spring. The treatment for warming illness differs from that for winter cold or summer heat illnesses, as the heat is lighter. Shengma Decoction, Jiejus Decoction, and Chaihu Guizhi Decoction are the best. For those with more heat, Xiao Chaihu Decoction is the main remedy; for those who are not thirsty but have slight heat, it is Xiao Chaihu plus Guizhi; for those with a cough, it is Xiao Chaihu plus Wuweizi. If there is restlessness, thirst, and fever, without aversion to cold and with virtual restlessness, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction, taken sequentially. Ma Huang, Guizhi, and Da Qinglong are used consistently in the northwest regions throughout all seasons, with no exceptions. In the warmer areas between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, the standard formulas should only be used in winter and early spring. From late spring to before the summer solstice, adjustments to Guizhi, Ma Huang, and Da Qinglong are necessary.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Confucian Duty to One&#39;s Parents</strong><br><strong>by Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>The illnesses of spring, summer, autumn, and winter—such as the warm diseases of spring, heat diseases of summer, intermittent fevers and dysentery of autumn, and cold conditions and coughs of winter—are all caused by the improper seasonal influences collectively referred to as &quot;harmful cold.&quot; Those who toil and labor excessively may come into contact with these inappropriate seasonal winds, heat, and dampness, resulting in illness. When a person is harmed by cold, heat accumulates within; if this manifests mildly, it appears as spring warmth. If it does not arise in spring but is significantly affected by summer heat, it becomes a heat illness in summer; if unaddressed in summer and impacted by dampness, it transforms into intermittent fevers and dysentery in autumn; if not resolved in autumn and exposed to cold, it becomes harmful cold in winter. Thus, the harmful cold has the deepest effects. However, both harmful cold and warm heat first present with symptoms of fever and aversion to cold, along with pain in the head and neck and stiffness in the back, which occurs in one day of the solar period. Though the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that one day of the sun represents usual transmission, there are cases of solar symptoms that do not transmit and only present with sweating, such as with the use of medications like Shengma Decoction, Xiejia Decoction, Baiduxing Powder, and Wujisuan, which can promote dispersal and lead to recovery.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

Recently, Mr. Liu Hejian has formulated a cooling remedy, combining Shengsheng and Yiyuan powders, each five to seven qian, with one bowl of water, adding more than ten slices of fresh ginger, over twenty scallion tops, and a pinch of fermented soybean. Boil until it reaches five or seven bubbles, then strain off the residue and divide into two doses. First, take most of it, then with a finger, stimulate the throat to induce vomiting, expelling the previous medicine. This initial purge opens the pores, causing sweating all over the body. Then, with the remaining medicine warmed up, take it again, also adding sour vinegar and spicy congee, which can lead to immediate recovery. </p>
<p>To alleviate the harm from cold and damp febrile diseases, two methods exist. During times of peace, when people are mostly calm and content without much labor, all that is still belongs to Yin. Even if warming agents are used to dispel exterior ailments and induce sweating, recovery can still be achieved. However, during chaotic times when disturbances are frequent, the comet behaves irregularly, military affairs arise, famine follows in succession, and the burdens are heavy, it is Yang. With internal heat also encroaching, if the physician does not understand the changes in the times and continues to use hot and spicy treatments, it deviates from human sentiment.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The remedy can utilize Liu Hejian&#39;s cooling agents. Within three days of treatment, ten out of nine patients recover. I have used this medicine for over forty years to treat conditions caused by cold, heat, summer heat, and hidden heat, the number of which is countless. This is not an exaggeration; rather, it is to caution future generations against misusing medicines. I have observed that some physicians use Rhubarb and Wujia to treat conditions caused by cold and warm epidemics, which often leads to delirium, nosebleeds, blood loss, wheezing, confusion, and distress. These symptoms do not only occur in cases of cold injury, but are all due to the inability to heal with warm agents, causing the heat to increase sharply. </p>
<p>When treating cold-induced ailments during epidemics, one should first consider the principles of temperature extremes in nature, turning to Ginseng. In regions with hot climates, it is advisable to use cooling agents; in regions with cold climates, warming agents are more suitable. In the months of midday and midday’s peak, where heat is prevalent, cooling remedies should be used; in the months of the Rat and Ox, where frost is common, warming remedies are advisable. Younger individuals with strong constitutions should use cooling agents; older individuals with weakened vitality should use warming agents.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a patient falls ill from exposure to cold and eating raw food, they should be treated with warming spices; if they become ill from overwork in the heat, they should be treated with cooling spices. For patients with a hot and irritable temperament, cooling spices may be suitable; for those with a gentle and calm temperament, warming spices would be appropriate. If a patient has a large and floating pulse in both wrists, they can be treated with cooling spices; if the pulses are slow and weak, warming spices should be used. Such illnesses cannot be treated with a one-size-fits-all approach. One must be aware of the variations in heat, cold, and the use of warming or cooling remedies—they should not be applied rigidly. Just as the earth has its north and south directions, seasons have their cold and heat, individuals can be weak or strong, pulses can be floating or sinking, and the dosages of remedies should not be mistaken. Patients’ prohibitions and limitations must be understood. In the past, there was someone who fell ill during the spring season and contracted an epidemic; after traveling over a hundred miles in a donkey cart within three days, they became disoriented upon disembarking and died several days later. Another person consumed too much alcohol and suffered internal and external disturbances; they experienced headaches and fever that resembled typhoid. After being carried back home on a horse for sixty to seventy miles over three or four days, they arrived home in severe pain all over and died in confusion.

In the case of plague, typhoid fever, febrile diseases, heatstroke, exposure to wind, or intoxication, one must be careful to avoid transportation by horse or carriage, which causes shaking and jostling—this is a major taboo. Motion is the transformation of fire, while stillness is the transformation of water. Stillness is yin, and motion is yang. Yang is heat, while yin is cold. When illness has already disrupted the internal balance, further external disturbances lead to aggravation, which is burdensome for the spirit—how can one endure that? Therefore, for those who fall ill on long journeys, it is advisable to float in a boat or lie on a bed, ensuring no external disturbances occur, so that the illness does not worsen. Additionally, if one experiences typhoid fever or plague and has not had a bowel movement for six or seven days, with hardness below the heart and tight fullness in the abdomen and sides, then one may administer a small dose of purgative decoction.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the intestines and stomach are overheated, one must be careful not to use poisonous drugs like croton seeds or apricot kernels, as both are hot and very toxic. Even if one takes one or two pills, causing a laxative effect five or seven times, it will inevitably harm the yin energy, deplete the bodily fluids, and increase dryness and heat, leading to yellowing of the eyes, delirium, frantic movements, blood leakage, and disarray. In mild cases, it may lead to recovery from exhaustion, while in severe cases, it could be fatal, with only rare instances of recovery. Thus, one should not adopt this as a method. </p>
<p>Therefore, for those recently recovering from a cold, one must be careful not to eat pork, fish, mixed fruits, strong liquor, or engage in bathing or similar activities. If one violates this, the illness is sure to relapse. Those who care for their health must be vigilant. </p>
<p>Moreover, during the months of February and March, when the yang energy rises and epidemics are rampant, one will often first experience headaches or joint pains, resembling symptoms of cold, seasonal ailments, heatstroke, wind-damp conditions, or alcohol intoxication. One must be cautious not to use croton seeds, which are highly toxic, to treat such conditions. </p>
<p>In the spring of the first year of Yuan Guang, in the capital, a scholar named Li Pingshan contracted epidemic symptoms, including headache, fever, dry mouth, and dark, painful urination. He had a penchant for drinking, and the doctor mistakenly gave him a medicine meant for alcohol intoxication, which contained croton seeds, resulting in more than ten bowel movements. The next day, his headaches and other ailments persisted, yet the doctor was unaware and instead prescribed spicy warming remedies, and added that he should rest on a warm kang (bed stove), forcing him to consume scallion vinegar soup in hopes of inducing sweating. Unbeknownst to them, various heat-related conditions rapidly emerged together, leading to yellowing of the eyes, tidal fever, blood leakage, and severe shortness of breath.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To this day, those who discuss it are numerous, yet they still do not recognize the fault of using hot medicine, often solely blaming Chengqi Decoction. Those who use Chengqi Decoction are unaware that the illness is already critical, and still administer the medication because they misunderstand the texts. This can indeed be blamed. However, it is also blameworthy that the critics do not hold the wine symptom pill accountable. When dealing with epidemic symptoms on the surface, one should not purgative, let alone use the pill made from cowbane. If cowbane is not effective, how can one continue to use the warming and acrid agent? There must be a reason why Confucius and the esteemed Gongye Chang are not at fault. The non-straightforwardness of Wei Shenggao is also questionable; he ultimately refuses to dedicate several years to the arduous study of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; but instead follows the opinions and preferences of the crowd, thus earning both praise and criticism. Those like this are mere nonsensical critics. Failing to truly understand the principles, yet hastily attributing blame or praise, is not something a gentleman would do. In my opinion, there are six prohibitions regarding cold damage: at the onset of the illness, it resembles a case of food poisoning from drinking; thus, the first prohibition is against heavy purging. When sweating, one must carefully consider the current temperature and whether to use thick or light bedding, avoiding hot baths or heated kang beds, and being cautious with hot porridge and needles; this is the second prohibition.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When sweating occurs, it is advisable to carefully examine the pulse for its slow rate and use cooling remedies, avoiding the reckless use of hot medicines—this is the first prohibition. At that moment, one should carefully consider the appropriate remedy, avoiding the use of Ba Dou (croton) and Silver Powder pills—this is the second prohibition. For patients who have come from afar, it is forbidden for them to be transported by cart or horse—this is the third prohibition. After significant sweating, one should avoid mixed foods and indulgent desires, as well as excessive worry and labor—this is the fourth prohibition. Therefore, for anyone with these issues, it is advisable to keep the room cool and the bed airy to prevent exposure to harmful heat; ensure the windows are bright and the room is well-lit, making it easy to observe changes in complexion. If the patient prefers cooling foods, then serve them cool; if they prefer warm foods, then serve them warm. Keep things clear without disturbance; allow them rest without exertion. If something can be treated with warming, use warming treatments; if cooling is needed, then apply cooling treatments. Observations must be very subtle without rigid restrictions. For those who desire water, be very cautious not to forbid it. However, after drinking, frequently massage their abdomen, which will help stimulate digestion. If one massages the middle area too long, pain will definitely occur, and if the patient experiences pain due to fluid accumulation, then they will hesitate to press on it. It is crucial to avoid what should be prohibited; if taken lightly, it may be dangerous, and in serious cases, it could lead to death. Likewise, if something is wrongly forbidden, the same applies.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Epidemic Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epidemics are illnesses that affect many people, also referred to as seasonal epidemics. There are three treatment principles: to tonify, to disperse, and to lower. For severe heat, add three cups of children&#39;s urine and wine. The &quot;big head&quot; epidemic is caused by dampness at high altitudes, so do not use methods to lower it. Winter warmth as a disease means the presence of its qi out of season. During the severe cold of winter, a noble person should close up and contain, and release it externally, mainly using tonic medicines along with exterior-releasing medicines, such as those that tonify the middle and boost qi.</p>

<p><strong>Big Head Cold</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;big head&quot; refers to both seasonal poison and epidemic poison. It arises when the qi of the sky&#39;s epidemic poison affects people, leading to big head colds. If it begins with redness and swelling on the nose and forehead, resulting in a face that is highly swollen and unable to open, with red and swollen facial features, this is associated with the Yangming channel. If there is intense fever, shortness of breath, dry mouth, or swollen sore throat, and a rapid pulse, use the Pujixiaodu Decoction. If there is severe internal heat, use the Tongsheng Xiaodu Decoction. If it appears around the ears, both front and back, with redness and swelling of the head, this is associated with the Shaoyang channel. If there is daytime fevers, alternating chills and heat, bitter mouth, dry throat, eye pain, and fullness in the sides, use Lesser Chaihu Decoction with added Tianhuafen, Qianghuo, Jingjiao, Lianqiao, Qinqin, and Lian.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

Generally, the treatment should not be too harsh; if you attack too strongly, the pathogenic qi will not submit and will instead retaliate internally, certainly harming the patient. Furthermore, if the head and face are depleted, this emptiness will reach everywhere. The treatment should start gentle and then become more intense, so that the evil can be subdued. The initial gentle approach should focus on reducing heat and dispelling toxins, while also supporting the vital energy of the deficient person. For those with weak stomach qi and poor appetite, aid the stomach qi as well. If their stools are hot and constipated, use Dahuang to purge and expel the root of the toxin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Seasonal Illness</strong></p>
<p>Seasonal illness refers to the fierce influences of heavenly timing that flow through the human realm. Whenever the seasonal cycles are misaligned, this energy manifests. For example, if spring should be warm but instead is cold, if summer should be hot but instead is cool, if autumn should be cool but instead is hot, and if winter should be cold but instead is warm, then the air of improper timing is at play. </p>
<p>Such disruptive influences harm the true vital energy, akin to how a weak wall invites thieves. However, if true vitality is robust, it is difficult for evil forces to intrude. The ailments caused by this are similar to those of cold damage. Cold damage occurs due to cold weather, while seasonal illness arises from exposure to pestilential energies; thus, their treatments cannot be the same, although dispersing medicines can be common to both.</p>
<p>For all dispersing decoctions: </p>
<ul>
<li>In spring, if there is cold, and the evil is in the liver, use Shengma and Gekegen decoction. </li>
<li>In summer, if there is coolness, and the evil is in the heart, use Tiaozhong decoction. </li>
<li>In autumn, if there is heat, and the evil is in the lungs, use Cangzhu and Baihu decoction. </li>
<li>In winter, if there is warmth, and the evil is in the kidneys, use Weirui decoction.</li>
</ul>
<p>For pestilential disease and the dispelling of toxic energies, if the exterior does not recover, use Qianghuo Conghe decoction, Zhengqi powder, Conghe Qianghuo powder, or Xiong Su powder, selecting as needed.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p>The cold epidemic is an illness caused by severe cold from the heavens. During the four seasons, if the heavens suddenly bring about extreme cold, and it leads to illness similar to a cold, it is called a cold epidemic. The symptoms are similar to those of standard cold damage, but the severe cold is milder. If the illness begins with headache, fever, aversion to cold, and tightness, or with nausea and vomiting, fullness in the middle, or food stagnation and lack of digestion, or abdominal pain: if there is no fever yet, one should use a modified Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San for treatment; if fever has already developed, then a Xin Wei Qiong Su San should promote sweating. If there is body pain, joint pain, and fever, Qiang Huo Chong He Tang with Zi Su should be the treatment.

The classics state: epidemic qi does not adhere to diagnosis, but rather should be understood through the nuances of seasonal changes.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

Additionally, using the Ruyi pill is also excellent.</p>
<p>The classics say: Spring brings warmth, summer brings heat, autumn brings coolness, and winter brings bitterness. The toxic effects of cold damage come from their capacity to kill. When one is harmed by the four seasons&#39; qi, which meridian is affected, and what illness arises? Generally, if spring is harmed by wind, summer will certainly bring diarrhea; if summer is harmed by heat, autumn will surely bring fevers and dysentery; if autumn is harmed by dampness, winter will certainly bring coughs; if winter is harmed by cold, summer will certainly bring miasmic fever. Miasmic fever comes every other day; intermittent fever comes daily. Coughs resulting from autumn&#39;s dampness and winter&#39;s cold battling together produce phlegm and lead to coughing. If winter is harmed by cold, miasmic fever will arise, and with spring&#39;s warm air battling it, it will turn into a warm disease. Thus, the regular qi of the four seasons can also deviate in timing, all due to disturbances that push the source of illness backwards. It is not just the time of injury that forecasts today&#39;s illness; hence, there are times when lingering conditions dissipate without manifesting as illness. Should one simply adhere to one theory? However, if one feels some internal disturbance or discomfort in the heart and abdomen, do not change the formula of Jinxing Zhenqi powder; instead, adjust it to correct the stomach qi.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cold Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>When the spring equinox arrives and extends to the autumn equinox, a sudden cold is termed as a cold epidemic, which is different from winter&#39;s cold damage. In March and April, there may be sudden cold; the yang energy is still weak, so the cold can cause illness, but the heat symptoms are still mild. In May and June, as yang energy becomes strong, the impact of cold leads to more severe heat symptoms. In July and August, as yang energy wanes, the cold causes only mild illness. </p>
<p>Those affected will exhibit symptoms similar to summer heat but with different treatments. This is because summer heat arises internally with the cold, while cold epidemic comes from external exposure. A regulated middle decoction should be the main remedy, adjusted according to the varying temperatures and conditions. Spicy cool or warm herbs can be added or reduced accordingly. The weakening occurs when the yang energy is suppressed, leading to heat. If the symptoms are mild and the yang energy is not significantly affected and hasn&#39;t yet developed into fever, one should look for remedies within the cold prevention medicines.</p>
<p>In spring, if one is afflicted by sudden heat, it is also referred to as a warm disease. If the cold harm from sweating and purging does not resolve the symptoms, it is likewise termed as warm disease. However, one should treat according to the specific channel symptoms, generally avoiding sweating and purging. For sudden warmth, remedies like Gardenia and Schizonepeta Decoction or the Nine-Flavor Qianghuo Decoction are suggested. For those with unresolved symptoms, a combination of Ginseng, Peony, and other herbal decoctions may be recommended.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;febrile disease&quot; refers to illnesses caused by the severe cold and lethal energies of winter. When these energies come into contact with a person, they may immediately fall ill, and this is termed &quot;febrile disease.&quot; If the illness does not manifest immediately, the cold toxin remains dormant in the skin and may transform into a febrile disease in spring or into a heat-related illness in summer. A heat-related illness is a more intense form of fever than a febrile disease. Once it has transformed into a febrile disease, it cannot be referred to as cold; those who do not despise cold yet experience thirst exemplify this. This is the essence of Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s teachings. </p>
<p>The herbs Ephedra and cinnamon twig are designated for the immediate illness of febrile diseases; what connection do they have with warmth and heat? Although the source of the illness is the same, the timing of the onset is different. Zhang Zhongjing treated these conditions with a distinct approach, which has been largely lost and remains unclear, leading to much debate among different schools of thought even today. Liu Shouzheng suggested that if one intends to use Ephedra and cinnamon twig, they must be combined with cooling herbs to prevent the onset of jaundice. Zhang Zihe&#39;s formula of Liu Shen Tong&#39;s dispersive powder, which incorporates gypsum, alongside Ephedra and Atractylodes, is also inappropriate. Ephedra and cinnamon twig are spicy and warm, and are suitable for dispersing cold pathogens in winter; they should not be used in spring or summer. Tao&#39;s notion that the Jiu Wei Qiang Huo Decoction could substitute for three different formulas is likewise incorrect.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Qianghuo Decoction, a formula created by Yi Lao, is designed to treat the inappropriate qi of the four seasons. For example, in spring it is suitable to be warm but instead it is cold; in summer it should be hot but instead it is warm; in autumn it should be cool but instead it is hot; in winter it should be cold but instead it is warm. Furthermore, during spring, summer, and autumn, there are instances of severe cold, which, although accompanied by symptoms of aversion to cold and fever, do not compare to the harshness of winter&#39;s sinister cold. Therefore, there is no need for Mahuang or Guizhi to disperse the cold; instead, it is better to use spicy and cool medicines to relieve both internal and external conditions. Moreover, this formula must be adjusted according to the principles of the six meridians and cannot be used in its entirety. It is better to use Xiaoyao Powder, which is particularly effective as one formula can replace three. If one wishes to treat warm diseases, what should be done? I have a method to explain. The classic states: if one does not dislike the cold and feels thirsty, this is the case. Not disliking the cold indicates that there is no cold evil on the surface; feeling thirsty suggests that the kidney&#39;s water is depleted. This is because such individuals have pre-existing fire; when exposed to cold qi in winter, though injured, it is not severe. The internal fire prevents the cold from penetrating deeply, which is why it does not produce immediate symptoms but instead hides beneath the skin. From winter into March or April, as time passes, the cold can stagnate within while the internal fire weakens, ultimately leading to the depletion of kidney water.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The wood element is associated with the spirit of yang, deriving its vitality from the water of the gui. When the kidney water becomes depleted, and at this time, the strong wood becomes vigorous without any source to nurture and moisten it, thus leading to heat and thirst, not due to an external cold invasion. Hai Zang states that new afflictions can provoke old ones, which is incorrect. If there is a new cold invasion, it will lead to aversion to cold. I use Liu Wei Di Huang to nourish the water, and Chai Hu, a cooling and acrid medicine, to relieve the stagnation of wood, responding flexibly to the body&#39;s needs; this method has brought many back to health. I also expand upon this principle. Generally, those who suffer from a cold during winter also exhibit symptoms of stagnant fire. If such a person has no fire, they are at the midpoint. Only when there is fire does it spread from skin and muscles to the internal organs. Nowadays, people say that cold pathogens penetrate inward, transforming into heat. If it is indeed a cold pathogen, why does it enter and then turn into heat? What causes it to transform into heat? It is unknown that it is the internal fire itself, trapped by cold, unable to vent, which then perpetuates itself. Over time, pure heat accumulates while cold dissipates. Therefore, I use San Huang to detoxify and resolve this fire.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Shengma and Gegeng are treatments for fire constraint, while the three承气 (Chengqi) formulas address earth constraint. Xiao Chaihu Decoction resolves wood constraint. This principle is very simple and easy to understand, but it has been obscured by the various interpretations found in the classics, leading to confusion. All mixed symptoms that include fever typically present with headaches, stiff necks, eye pain, dry noses, rib pain, and bitter mouths. There is no need to restrict the treatment to just typhoid fever and its specific formulas. In winter, when typhoid fever is prevalent, I alone treat with Mahuang and Guizhi formulas for cold constraint, while for those who do not share a dislike for the cold, I treat with fire constraint. This is not a foolish invention, and those who hear it are often astonished. Additionally, when reading Yu Tianmin’s &quot;Medical Correct Records&quot; in the section on typhoid fever, it states that an enlightened person passed down that transmitted fever is a constraint disease. Upon seeing this, I felt secretly pleased, believing this echoed my own thoughts. On examining the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the Emperor asks why people injured by cold manifest as heat. Qibo replies that the principle is that cold air condenses externally while causing internal constraint. The pores are tight and closed, so the qi cannot circulate freely, leading to the accumulation of dampness. Externally, cold pressure combined with internal constraint causes the heat to arise; thus, when a person is harmed by cold, it transitions into heat. If sweating occurs, recovery follows, which clarifies the principle of external condensation coupled with internal constraint. From this observation, it is clear that my view of typhoid fever as fire constraint is not without evidence.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;In winter, one is harmed by the cold; in spring, one is sure to fall ill from warmth,&quot; indicating that warm disease is indeed a result of cold injury. However, cold injury manifests differently in each season. For instance, if one contracts a cold infection in winter, it is true cold injury. If cold toxins invade internally before manifesting as illness, they will wait for the warming influence of spring, at which point the genuine yang is overwhelmed and the cold pathogens reassert themselves, leading to illness. Therefore, if someone encounters cold in spring, it manifests as warm disease; if they encounter cold in summer, it appears as heat disease. This is similar to how those injured by qi flare up upon encountering qi, and those injured by food react to food—the principles are the same. </p>
<p>However, cold-related epidemics often arise when the essence is not stored in winter, particularly among the hungry and overworked. Not storing essence in winter allows the evil qi to invade easily, while those suffering from hunger and fatigue are particularly vulnerable. Thus, after a great famine, there will inevitably be a significant epidemic, precisely for this reason. Once this epidemic qi becomes prominent, it will surely spread, first affecting the physically weak and unclean, and then gradually spreading to others, leading to illnesses that do not necessarily wait for winter&#39;s cold. Nevertheless, these diseases are fundamentally attributed to the cold nature dominating the qi.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the changes in weather and climate, they vary with the seasons. Hence, during winter, when following spring protocols, one feels cold instead of warmth; during summer, following winter protocols, one feels heat instead of cold. The same applies to spring and autumn. This results in a situation where there is the influence of the seasons without being in their proper time. The strong remain unharmed, while the timid suffer; this extends beyond just winter cold, reflecting the harm of improper climatic influences, which one should be aware of and carefully avoid.</p>
<p>Epidemics are essentially diseases caused by external evils, primarily manifested in the form of febrile illnesses such as typhus. However, when one contracts these seasonal conditions, the symptoms may not always align, leading to what we term an epidemic. The ancients have said that epidemic conditions arise due to warm air in the spring, which leads to internal heat manifesting outwardly, and not necessarily from cold injuries to the surface. Thus, it&#39;s appropriate to use mild, warming remedies; treatment differs from that for typical cold injuries with ephedra. This notion certainly has its basis, but it is not always true. If an epidemic were not a surface condition, why would sweating be necessary for relief? Therefore, in my earlier discussions, I posited that one first succumbs to cold influences, then manifests the illness—a logical conclusion. However, during that time, cold and heat can exist, and symptoms may indicate either yin or yang. Treatments for yang and heat conditions can indeed be effective in winter, while treatments for yin and cold conditions can be applied in spring and summer. It is advisable to tailor treatment according to symptoms and conditions; stating that superficial cold injuries do not occur would not hold true.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the treatment of febrile diseases, I have already analyzed the six essentials; beyond these six, there are also five prohibitions. Why is this?

Typically, sweating is achieved by using pungent dispersing ingredients. However, why can the five methods also induce sweating? If the six essentials are present, why is there a need for distinctions regarding the five prohibitions? The reason is that sweating results from the liquefaction of fluids, emerging from yang and originating from yin. </p>
<p>If the skin is tightly closed and the nutrients (ying) and protective (wei) energies do not move, then without using pungent dispersants, the foundational forces cannot open, and sweating will not occur—this is the first reason. Secondly, if pathogenic heat burns internally, causing the blood to dry and bodily fluids to deplete, then without using cooling methods, the yin energy cannot nourish, and sweating will not occur—this is the second reason. Thirdly, if yin pathogens are firmly closed, preventing the passage of yang energy, then without employing pungent warming methods, the flow will be blocked, and sweating will not occur—this is the third reason. Fourthly, if the nutrients and protective energies are deficient and there is an internal deficiency, then without using strong tonics, blood and qi cannot be replenished and sweating will not occur—this is the fourth reason. Lastly, if the pathogen is located in the upper burner, obstructing the pathways for yang, then without inducing vomiting or purging, the clear qi cannot rise, and sweating will not occur—this is the fifth reason.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a邪 has entered the Yangming and the stomach qi is obstructed, then without promoting a downward flow, the turbid qi will not disperse and sweat will not be released; this is the sixth point. All of these pertain to the method of inducing sweat, which is what is known as the six essentials. What are the five taboos? First, if heat is on the surface but is not true fire within, one must avoid cold; cold causes the yin邪 to congeal and not disperse, which will deepen the邪 and worsen the yang, resulting in death if sweating cannot occur. Second, if the original qi is weak and cannot overcome邪, one must avoid depleting; depletion reduces the正氣, and without replenishment the邪 will strengthen, worsening the condition until sweating cannot happen, leading to death. Third, if there is a real邪 inside that has formed and there is internal fire inflammation, one must avoid warm tonics; warmth further dries and tonics strengthen the邪, causing death if sweating cannot happen. Fourth, if the center is deficient and the qi is weak, all rules regarding sweating should be heeded; one must avoid dispersion; dispersing causes the qi to escape, and if qi escapes, sweating cannot occur, leading to death. Fifth, if the disease is not due to real邪 in the Yangming, one must avoid purging; purging depletes yin, and if yin is deficient, yang邪 becomes deeply entrenched, resulting in death if sweating cannot occur. These are the five taboos. To know the six essentials and avoid the five taboos is the entirety of treating febrile diseases. However, there are many instances of false heat and few of true heat; only those with exceptional insight can detect subtle differences.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Inducing Sweating</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold and epidemic diseases, when the initial symptoms are present, it is crucial to induce sweating promptly; delay is not permissible. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing said: In general, when inducing sweating through medicinal decoctions, even if the prescription states to take it three times a day, if the illness is severe and does not resolve, one should take all three doses within half a day. If after taking one dose the symptoms persist, one should take the original decoction again. If there are those who refuse to sweat, they may need to take three doses before relenting. If sweating cannot be induced, it is considered a deadly condition. This is what is meant by not delaying the act of sweating. However, when inducing sweating, one must also observe the balance of the vital energy and the pathological condition. If the disease arises suddenly, and the exterior symptoms are present without the vital energy being depleted, then one should simply use pungent and neutral substances to disperse the pathogens directly. If there are mixed symptoms, one should assess the nature of the cold or heat and treat accordingly, rather than merely focusing on dispersing.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Method for Supplementing Deficiency</h3>
<p>Febrile diseases, like cold damage and epidemics, are both manifestations of external invasion; only those with internal excess can resist them. If one is affected but the evil cannot overcome the good, even in illness there’s no harm. The greatest fear lies with those who are internally deficient, for the good cannot withstand the evil, and the harmful influences will inevitably penetrate deeply, causing great damage. Thus it is said: &quot;Cold damage primarily harms the internally deficient.&quot; Furthermore, many people today are weak and deficient, while those who are strong and robust are few. If one were to encounter cold damage with underlying deficiency and not know to urgently address the root cause, the chance of survival is nearly nonexistent. Therefore, texts on cold damage state: &quot;Those with yang symptoms who have an阴脉 (yin pulse) will die,&quot; precisely because a yin pulse indicates deficiency. In distinguishing this, the pulse is primary, supplemented by physical signs, which ensures no error. Generally, when encountering cold damage or other heat-related symptoms, if the pulse appears weak, floating, and without strength upon pressure, this indicates deficiency; it is the most difficult to resolve and least appropriate to attack. Even if one wants to induce sweating, it is difficult for sweat to emerge. If some slight sweating occurs, it is merely forcing the skin to produce sweat, and it is certainly not something transformed through the nourishment of the ying and wei (nutritive and defensive) fluids. If one disregards the balance of deficiency and excess and pushes too hard, it will quickly exhaust the vital energy, leading to imminent danger. Thus, when treating deficiency, one must carefully observe the nuances of deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is in a state of moderate deficiency, one must primarily focus on tonifying while also addressing the邪 (pathogenic factors). If one is in a state of severe deficiency, one should completely avoid treating the邪 and concentrate solely on restoring the fundamental essence. By focusing on the essence, one aims to preserve life; if life is sustained, the vital energy will gradually recover. It may take seven days, fourteen days, or even up to twenty days afterward for the vital energy to gain strength, and the邪 will naturally be defeated without any attack. When profuse sweating occurs, recovery will ensue. To understand the signs, one must also observe the pulse. If the weak becomes progressively stronger, the small becomes larger, the taut becomes smoother, and the tight becomes looser, then profuse sweating is imminent and a fortunate period is approaching. When employing tonification methods, one must observe the condition of the thorax and abdomen. If there is significant stagnation in the chest and abdomen, tonification should not be applied; if a person is young and has abundant energy, tonification should also be avoided. However, if the energy is inherently deficient and there is no stagnation in the chest and abdomen, one may boldly proceed with tonification.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is no internal heat pathogen, it is advisable to use warmth. If there is a difficulty in the flow of Qi, then one must warm the stomach before it can recover. For to补 (tonify) is to acquire warmth and promote flow, while the pathogen, when warmed, disperses rapidly. One must not mix with depleting cold or cooling methods, as this would divide the strength of warming and tonification. If one is initially affected by a cold pathogen and shows true deficiency in pulse and symptoms indicating the pathogen is hard to disperse, then herbs like ginseng and cooked rehmannia should be used promptly—the sooner, the better. Delaying will only allow the thief (the pathogen) to delve deeper, making it harder to control. This is the best method for treating deficiency pathogens. I have used this method to save many lives. I have heard that some ignorant individuals avoid tonics for fear of cold damage, not realizing that tonification is meant to support the interior, which is indeed a great principle. Just as a cold pathogen comes from the outside like a thief, the vital essence is like citizens guarding the interior. Strong citizens enable a strong interior, and a strong interior is what guards against the external. To preserve the essential mechanism of life, this is the only key to protecting against pathogenic Qi. To insist on avoiding tonification is to mislead people, and nothing could be worse than this.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

Gradually using and becoming familiar with them, I am beginning to understand their subtleties. From now on, I know that there will be countless individuals who, without doubt, will accept my words and obtain life from me. </p>
<p>In cold damage, when the essence and blood are inherently weak, or when the yang energy within the yin is insufficient, the pulse is thin and weak, accompanied by a dislike of cold; one must greatly assist the true yin. Then, the yang will emerge from the yin, and the exterior pathogen can be rapidly resolved. It is best to prepare a formula that regulates the yin, adding ingredients like Chai Hu and Ma Huang, or adjusting according to the symptoms as needed. </p>
<p>If, after seven or eight days of cold damage, the pulse is rapid and weak, the spirit is cloudy, and there is fatigue, or restlessness and unease, if dispersing or clearing methods do not work and the pathogen cannot be resolved, then one should administer a large dose of a formula that regulates the yin, which is truly a revitalizing remedy. </p>
<p>If both qi and blood are deficient and the pathogen cannot be resolved, one should aim for a balanced tonification, primarily using the Five Blessings Drink, adjusting according to symptoms. Alternatively, one could use the Great Augmentation Decoction, Six Ingredients Decoction, or the Complete Great Tonifying Soup, all of which are permissible. </p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach qi is weak and the pathogen cannot be resolved, one should use a modified Si Jun Zi Decoction. If middle qi is weak, with cold in the spleen or accompanying nausea, and the pathogen cannot be resolved, one should consider the Five Jun Zi Decoction or Warm Stomach Drink. If fatigue damages the spleen, and cold pathogens invade, causing persistent fever, one should use the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction. If cold pathogens penetrate deeply, leading to yin deficiency and blood weakness that cannot manifest outwardly, but when ascending and dispersing is necessary, one should use the Yin-Supplementing and Qi-Boosting Decoction.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is yin deficiency with fever, a flushed face, thirst, restlessness, and a floating, rapid, and weak pulse, one should administer a large dose of Liu Wei Di Huang Tang, which can yield results after one dose. If there is a deficiency of central qi and the exterior pathogen does not resolve, or if one has developed a fear of medicine over time, or if various medicines have proven ineffective, then only Ren Shen Tang should be used. It may be thick or thin, hot or cold, according to the patient&#39;s preference, and it can be served as tea intermittently for consecutive days. This allows the nourishing qi to gradually recover, leading to the departure of pathogenic qi, resulting in significant restorative effects, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>The method of supplementation in treating cold damage differs from that of purging or dispersing. The purpose of purging and dispersing is to eliminate the substantial pathogen, demanding a forceful approach with swift effects; thus, when using herbs like Chai Hu or Ma Huang, results are expected within one to three doses, and with Da Huang or Mang Xiao, results can be seen after one dose. If there is no effect, it likely stems from improper use, and excessive application is unnecessary. In contrast, supplementation aims to restore deficiency, employing a gentler force with slower effects; thus, even if results are observed after one or two doses, it is common. However, if there is accumulated labor and severe deficiency of qi and blood, achieving restoration can be challenging. </p>
<p>One must observe whether taking supplements presents no issues, and if there is a slight correspondence between the pulse and symptoms, it indicates the power of supplementation is being obtained. For lighter cases, two to three doses may suffice, while for heavier cases, more than ten doses may be required to see results, leading to sweating and the retreat of pathogens for healing. If one does not understand this principle and expects immediate effects within one or two doses, it may lead to doubt and confusion, ultimately undermining the entire effort, which must be carefully considered.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p>However, when using warming methods, one must observe if the exterior feels hot while the interior is actually not warm; this signifies false heat, indicating a preference for warming over cooling. Even if the illness presents with heat, if the vital energy is deficient, it is still false heat, and thus, warmth is favored over coolness. True heat is easily recognized, but false heat is difficult to distinguish. If one suffers from false heat, failing to use sweet warmth will result in persistent fever, especially when true cold is also present, which is evident without further explanation. </p>
<p>Generally, true conditions often show true heat, while deficient conditions usually present false heat. Therefore, true ailments tend to be treated with cooling methods, while deficient ailments are commonly treated with warmth. Misidentifying the true and false forms of heat can lead to significant mistakes. Additionally, distinguishing between true cold and false heat entails recognizing that both true and false can manifest in cold and heat states.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Principles of Purging</h3>
<p>In treating epidemic fever, it is essential to clear and purify, which is not limited to just one approach. Generally, if there is excess heat, it is advisable to clear the heat; if there is excess qi, it is appropriate to move the qi; if there is food stagnation, it is necessary to resolve the food; if there is phlegm accumulation, it should be transformed. All of these methods fall under the category of clearing and purging. When these issues are resolved, the stagnation dissipates, allowing the qi to flow and the external evils to resolve themselves. However, these methods should be employed primarily for excess conditions and are not suitable for deficiency syndromes. In cases where there is a combination of deficiency with some excess, it is acceptable to use them sparingly. The key lies in discerning the appropriate measure. If the condition is critical, there should be no room for error. If one inappropriately uses clearing methods when they should not be applied, it is akin to striking a dying flame. </p>
<p>For cases of high fever in epidemic fever, the treatment should be to clear and resolve. When heat enters the Yangming stage, causing thirst, agitation, and a strong pulse with persistent evil, it is appropriate to use the Chai Hu Bai Hu Decoction, or simply Bai Hu Decoction, Tai Qing Drink, or Yu Quan Powder; if there is still heat after sweating, these remedies should also be used. If there is thirst, agitation, and red spots, with a strong yet weak pulse, Ren Shen Bai Hu Decoction is recommended.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of cold damage or epidemics where purging is indicated, it is essential that there is an obstruction in the Yangming channel due to excess in the bowels, leading to secreted accumulation and abdominal fullness, before initiating purgation. If the patient has inherently strong vital energy and a robust stomach, purging can also be considered. However, if there has been no bowel movement for several days, yet the abdomen is not distended, and there are no signs of constipation or blockage, and if the patient has not eaten for consecutive days but the abdomen remains relaxed and unobstructed, it indicates that the Yangming stomach and bowels are not truly obstructed by excess, and care must be taken to avoid reckless purging that could deplete the interior energy. Furthermore, the rules against purging in cases of cold damage should be heeded carefully, so as not to misapply treatment. Misjudgments in this regard can have particularly severe consequences. Although there may be instances where some physicians recklessly administer purgatives without causing death, it is likely because the patient’s vital energy is naturally strong enough to withstand the effects of purging.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, this evidence of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess is all-encompassing, and it should still be treated as before, without being rigidly adhered to. When an epidemic first arises with symptoms of headache and body aches, aversion to cold and fever, a tight and rapid pulse, and no other symptoms, it is advisable to use Chai Hu Decoction, or Bai Du San, or Shi Shen Tang. If the epidemic begins with more yin and less yang, and the pulse shows no deficiency, Shen Zhu San should be used. If there is fullness and oppression in the chest due to the epidemic, Xiao Chai Hu Tang should be modified with Zhi Shi and Ju Hong; if there is internal heat, add Huang Lian. In hot months when epidemics occur, with both exterior and interior heat being severe, it is appropriate to use Qiang Huo Sheng Ma Decoction to clear heat and resolve toxins. If the epidemic exhibits strong fire symptoms, with a large and rapid pulse and severe agitation, San Huang Shi Gao Tang should be used. If the heat and toxins from the epidemic rise, causing swelling in the head and face, inability to open the eyes, dryness of the mouth and tongue, and difficulty swallowing, Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin is recommended. If the epidemic presents with a large and rapid pulse, causing agitation and thirst, Bai Hu Tang is suitable; or if there are accompanying symptoms of vomiting, use Zhong Jing Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>Xu Donggao said: If the epidemic does not resolve after six or seven days, and heat enters the blood chamber causing yellowing, the body feels as if it has been smoked, the eyes appear golden, the mouth is dry and hot with hardened stools, then one should use a needle to prick the cubital region to expel bad blood, along with using Tong Sheng San combined with a purgative, achieving sweating like yellow water and stools like black grease for recovery.

<p>The Big Head Pestilence is caused by the malevolent toxins of heaven affecting the channels of the three Yangs, resulting in a hatred of cold, fever, swelling of the head, neck, or throat, and even redness of the cheeks and face, with swelling of the shoulders and back, resembling a toad; hence it is also known as Toad Pestilence.

There are also times when external toxic conditions manifest as this.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment methods for Big Head Toad Pestilence:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>When the illness is localized in the head and internal heat is not excessive, the first approach should be to disperse it, using Chai Hu decoction or Bai Du San. </li>

<li>When the external and internal heat are both present, with swelling in the head and neck, and clearance along with dispersion is needed, use Chai Ge Decoction. </li>
<li>If the current toxin in the Yangming is causing both external and internal heat with severe headaches and nasal dryness, a dispersing approach is suitable with Chai Ge Jie Ji Tang. </li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Initial Concepts of Treatment</p>
<p>In any case of illness, whether due to cold, plague, or fever, there is invariably a rise in temperature. However, at the onset of an illness, when the pathogenic influence is still on the surface and has not penetrated inward or reached the state of congested heat, although there may be a fever at the surface, it is merely due to cold pathogens affecting the skin and layers without the presence of internal fire. How can this be considered a yang condition? At this time, one should only use warming and dispersing methods, perhaps also incorporating mild purging, with the medication tailored to the condition, and it will surely lead to immediate recovery. Yet, unfortunately, the conventional doctors of the time see a fever and immediately assume it to be fire, indiscriminately using herbs like qin, lian, and zhu, not realizing that there is no real heat within. How can such a method be appropriate? If cold pathogens are treated with cold medicines, both the exterior and interior become colder, and if there is no resolution, it will lead to an inward transmission of the cold within days. The reckless use of cold and cooling methods results in the continual decline of the vital yang, causing much loss of life. When this principle is not understood, one becomes oblivious to the conditions of the exterior and interior, as well as the order of treatment. Throughout their lives, they fail to recognize this, often leading others astray, and yet they dare to speak confidently about medicine. Can their hearts truly find peace in such arrogance?<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Dietary Recommendations and Prohibitions</p>
<p>In matters of diet, there are things that are advisable and things that should be avoided. For those suffering from a cold or fever who cannot stop eating, this indicates that external pathogens are still superficial and have not yet penetrated deeply. As the condition deepens and rests between the superficial and the interior, appetite gradually diminishes. Once the pathogens reach the chest and stomach, one may completely lose the desire to eat. If the pathogen resides in the stomach, one will not feel hungry; thus, in cases of cold, the lack of appetite may last for ten or even twenty days without significant concern, as the stomach’s qi is not depleted. However, if one does not wish to eat, they should not be forced; doing so will support the pathogen. After recovery, when the stomach qi is starting to awaken, it is especially important not to indulge in food, as overindulgence may lead to a relapse. These are all critical prohibitions. As for those who must avoid certain foods, such as individuals with internal injuries due to overwork who happen to catch a cold, they will also likely develop a fever; this is primarily due to damage to the middle qi and not from genuine internal invasion by an external cold pathogen. Therefore, although they may exhibit a fever, they often feel hunger and have a strong desire for food.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How lamentable that the ignorant, upon sensing a fever, declare it to be merely hunger or a cold, without discerning the true nature of the illness, and they indiscriminately impose prohibitions against eating. Those who are hungry often find their requests unmet and are further subjected to harsh medicines that expel cold and dampness. Alas! The hungry bellies suffer, the weak become weaker, and with attacks from both inside and out, they endure suffering without recourse. When the stomach energy has already diminished, they no longer desire food. Even if one wishes to save them, it becomes impossible. </p>
<p>I often treat this condition by using food as medicine, having saved many lives, yet I have also witnessed many perish due to the prohibition of food, so I speak of this matter in detail. If a patient constantly feels hungry and seeks food, it indicates that the pathogen is not within the organs but rather that the stomach is empty; thus, it must not be prohibited, though it should not be indulged excessively. This is crucial for discerning the true condition of the patient and must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Chao said: In the case of those recovering from an epidemic illness, when the spleen and stomach are still weak and the energy of grains has not yet returned, engaging in excessive activity and consuming fatty meats such as pork, lamb, chicken, fish, as well as hard-to-digest fruits and starchy foods will lead to stagnation in the stomach and intestines, causing bloating and constipation, or severe vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in a recurrence of fever, making the illness incurable. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Pestilence is the malevolent energy of heaven and earth. If a person&#39;s inner vital energy is strong and upright, then this malevolent force cannot interfere, and one will not be contaminated. Therefore, the method to avoid it lies in moderation in desires and fatigue. Particularly after sexual activity and fatigue, one should keep their distance and avoid enduring hunger to receive its energy; these are essential practices. </p>
<p>As for methods to repel malevolence, as mentioned in the discussion on puncturing, the heavenly energy should continuously return. The energy emanates from the brain, thus not touching the malevolence. The &quot;heavenly energy&quot; refers to the nose, which receives the energy of heaven, hence it is called the heavenly conduit. The energy comes empty and also wishes to leave empty; thus, the heavenly energy continuously returns. </p>
<p>Since energy communicates with the nose, and the nose connects to the brain, if poison enters the brain, it spreads throughout the channels, causing contamination. When energy issues from the brain, one can sneeze or open the nose to release it. If one absorbs energy from a room, then expels it outward while deeply inhaling fresh energy, the malevolent force will escape through the nose, dissipating the toxic energy; this is the method to repel malevolence externally. </p>
<p>Additionally, practices such as visualizing the mind as the sun belong to the Gallbladder, which is affiliated with the Lesser Yang, serving as the central and upright official. When the Lesser Yang energy is strong, the energy of the organs is similarly robust, and thus malevolence cannot enter; this is a method of forcefully resisting malevolence from within. </p>
<p>In all matters of visiting relatives or diagnosing ailments, should circumstances require action, just knowing these methods enables one to remain untroubled even in the dirtiest places. One remedy for dealing with seasonal ailments and strange phenomena in dwellings is to burn Zheng Zhen incense, which greatly dispels malevolence and filth. It is also effective for children to carry it, as it can resolve various evils. A particular method involves sucking on Fujian fragrant tea cakes intermittently to expel the cold and toxic energies.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<p>The signs of epidemics have no fixed origins, yet there are reasons behind their summoning. It may arise from disturbances in human affairs, deviations in the elemental forces of nature, the contamination from corpses, or the transformation and emission of toxic vapors—all of which can lead to epidemic diseases. Since the manifestations differ, the treatments cannot be unified. However, those afflicted by epidemics mostly harbor a heated energy; when contained within a household, the entire family suffers, when concentrated in a village, the whole community suffers, and when gathered in a marketplace, an entire city suffers; if amassed along roadways, countless distances may fall ill. Thus, while the symptoms vary, addressing the heated energy and minimizing the addition of products meant to expel evils and impurities has proven effective for all. </p>
<p>The formula employs five qian of Yuan Shen, three qian each of Da Huang, Mai Dong, Bai Shao, Hua Fen, two qian of Shi Gao, and one qian each of Chai Hu and Jing Jie, to be boiled in water for consumption. This formula can universally treat epidemic diseases, with adjustments made as needed, all effects are beneficial. The essence of this formula lies in using Da Huang to cleanse the evils from the chest and abdomen, employing Jing Jie and Chai Hu to disperse the mixed external and internal pathogenic energies, employing Tian Hua Fen to eliminate phlegm and resolve blockages, using Shi Gao to eliminate the fire within the stomach, and employing Bai Shao to calm the liver&#39;s wood energy, preventing it from overwhelming the spleen&#39;s earth energy, thereby sustaining the righteous energy and expelling the evil energy. This formula is the most suitable and miraculous for those treating epidemics, serving as a secret kept close.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Recipe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tusu Wine</strong>: This is a recipe from “Qianjin Prescription.” It dispels pestilential energy, preventing one from contracting warm diseases and typhoid fever. On New Year&#39;s Day, make Tusu wine as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>15 zhū of rhubarb </li>
<li>18 zhū each of white atractylodes and cassia </li>
<li>50 zhū each of platycodon and Sichuan pepper </li>
<li>12 zhū of peony root </li>
<li>6 zhū of aconite</li>
</ul>
<p>The above seven ingredients are to be ground and placed in a red bag. On the night of the last day of the twelfth month, suspend this bag in a well until it becomes muddy. On the first day of the first month, retrieve the medicine early in the morning, and decoct it several times in the wine, then drink it in a room facing east. </p>
<p>For Tusu wine, start with a small quantity, adjusting the amount freely. If one person drinks, there will be no pestilence in that household; if an entire household drinks, there will be no pestilence in that neighborhood. If the medicated wine is consumed for three mornings, the dregs should be placed back in the well. If it is drunk again the following year, one can live without illness. </p>
<p>All wells inside and outside the home should be treated with this medicine to dispel pestilential energy. There is also an alternative recipe that includes one liang of siler.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the second year of Han Jian Ning, when the Tai Sui was in the You month, a plague spread, and many people died. A scholar named Ding Jihui came from Qingcheng Mountain in Shu. Upon passing through Nanyang and entering through the west city gate, he saw many afflicted by the plague. He then took out medicine from his pouch and gave each person one pill. The miraculous medicine touched their lips, and there was no illness that did not heal. </p>
<p>In the market, there were hundreds of plague spirits; seeing the scholar administering medicine, they all fled in fear. Then a spirit king approached the scholar and sought to learn his method, moved by the way he dispensed the medicine that made the other spirits flee. The scholar replied: &quot;I have no special method, only the medicine in my pouch.&quot; Upon seeing the medicine, the spirit king grew alarmed, bowed his head, and fled for his life.</p>
<p>This medicine, when taken into the mountains, can fend off tigers, wolves, insects, and snakes; when entering water, it can dispel water monsters and creatures like the jiao and shen.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br>Realgar, orpiment, Cangqing (A kind of medicinal herb), Gui Duyou (a spirit), pearl, tiger bone, cinnabar, balloon flower root, white atractylodes, ligusticum, white angelica, ghost arrow feather, wild mustard, female Cangqing, ghost saucer, rhizoma of veratrum, sweet flag, and sapindus; each one tael.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Firefly Pills are meant to ward off pestilence and evil energies, as well as protect against all malevolent spirits, tigers, wolves, snakes, and various poisons, along with weapons and the harm caused by thieves. </p>
<p>To prepare, take one or two of the following: fireflies, the skin and feathers of ghost arrows, and spiny thorns; two drachmas each of realgar, orpiment, and alum, burned until juices are gone; one and a half drachmas of sheep horn; one and a half drachmas of ashes from a forge; and one and a half drachmas of burnt iron hammer handles. </p>
<p>Grind the nine ingredients into powder and mix them with the yolk of a chicken egg and the comb of a male rooster, forming pills the size of almonds. Shape these into three triangular silk pouches containing five pills each, then wear them on the left arm and hang another pouch at the door.</p>
<p>The Holy Powder is discussed by Su Neihan, who mentions a time he examined the “Thousand Gold,” which describes various powdered prescriptions and claims to have no limits in curing diseases. Sun Simiao particularly highlighted that this prescription uses medicinal materials with an unusual balance, effective in emergency situations and producing remarkable results. It shows that miraculous substances work effectively, unrestricted by common methods, and reveal profound truths beyond human understanding. What I refer to as the Holy Powder is akin to this. </p>
<p>Historically, discussions on illness indicate that typhoid fever is the gravest threat; the signs and symptoms vary daily, and if treatment differs by a tiny margin, one may not survive. When poisons are in circulation, using the Holy Powder can address any illness without concern for yin or yang. It should be taken continuously without comparison to typhoid fever. When an outbreak occurs, at dawn, boil a pot, not discerning age or status, and use one large cup for everyone, so that none will be afflicted. If taken on an empty stomach during normal health, it ensures hearty meals and prevents all diseases, serving as a treasure for protecting lives and families.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The formula is one that is not known for its origin, yet the esteemed physician, Lord Chao, treasured it as a precious remedy for treating epidemics, achieving a remarkable success rate. After acquiring it, I was exiled to Huangzhou, where I faced years of severe outbreaks, during which countless lives were saved. Initially, Lord Chao was very reluctant to share this formula, swearing an oath by the river and agreeing not to pass it on to others. I firmly insisted he divulge it to the Daoist master Pang Anchang of Qishui, as he was renowned for his medical expertise and skill in writing. Thus, it was given to him, ensuring that both Lord Chao&#39;s name and the formula would achieve lasting fame.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>During a time of cold damage: Pig fat like a ball, dissolve in warm water and take three times a day. </p>
<p>For ailments caused by climatic stress: A piece the size of a jujube pit, take one. </p>
<p>For fever-induced madness, running around like a madman, seeing ghosts, not sweating for a long time, and not knowing people or situations: Take human bile and place it in a large jar, mix with clay and bake for half a day to remove the fire toxins, grind into powder, and take three qians with freshly drawn water. If symptoms persist, take again.</p>
<p>For great head fevers: Use Qianghuo, yellow gentian, and large yellow (rhubarb) steamed with wine, then decoct in water to take. </p>
<p>Another formulation: There is a miraculous remedy for treating epidemics: one tael of dried silkworms and two large yellow (rhubarbs), mix with ginger juice into balls like pellets, and adjust with well water and honey for a refreshing effect. </p>
<p>For pestilential heat diseases with upper jiao (upper organ) obstruction or phlegm with food causing reversed qi: Crush radish seeds, mix with warm soup, and drink the diluted liquid slowly until you feel an urge to vomit. If vomiting is incomplete, it will be expelled from below. Alternatively, grind to powder and take with warm water, one spoonful, which is also effective.</p>
<p>Another formulation: Use a small amount of salt and roast until red in a pan, then add water, stirring until just before boiling, and test the taste until it is slightly bland, drink half a bowl at a time, gradually increasing the amount until vomiting occurs. Use the cessation of illness as a measure. </p>
<p>Another formulation: Various medicines can induce vomiting, but should be prepared as a decoction according to the symptoms to facilitate vomiting.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The celestial movement of epidemics: Take the clothing of an initial patient, steam it over a pot, and then the entire family will remain uninfected. </p>
<p>Another method: Use powdered excrement from peach borer insects, take a spoonful with water, and it will prevent contagion.</p>
<p>Another method: On the first day of May, take soil or bricks and stones, place them in a pottery vessel, bury them outside the doorsteps, and the entire household will not suffer from seasonal ailments.</p>
<p>Another method: On New Year’s Day, take bricks from ancient tombs, chant incantations, and hang them above the main door, ensuring a year without epidemics.</p>
<p>Guidance</p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; the discussion on acupuncture methods addresses the prevention of transmission in an epidemic chamber. The Emperor said: I have heard that when five epidemics arrive, they easily transmit among each other, regardless of severity, and the symptoms are similar; if no treatment is applied, how can one avoid contagion? Qibo replied: To avoid contagion, one must preserve the righteous qi within, so that evil cannot invade, thus avoiding its toxic influence. The celestial essence has always existed and can return to its original state. </p>
<p>The qi emanates from the brain, preventing interference. When the qi flows from the brain, first focus your thoughts as if the heart were like the sun. When entering an epidemic chamber, first visualize the blue qi emanating from the liver, moving left towards the east, transforming into trees; next, visualize the white qi from the lungs, moving right towards the west, transforming into weaponry; then, visualize the red qi from the heart, moving south above, transforming into flames; next, visualize the black qi from the kidneys, moving north below, transforming into water; finally, visualize the yellow qi from the spleen, residing in the center, transforming into earth. By completing the protection of the five qís, visualize them above your head, like the brilliance of the Big Dipper, then one may enter the epidemic chamber.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>
