      <div><p><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 424: Disorders of Infants</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infant Disorders Caused by External Influences</strong></p>
<p>It is said: The reason why young children experience disorders from external influences is due to the harmful breaths brought by outsiders, referred to as &#39;guests,&#39; thus causing disturbances. Even if they are family members, such as those from different houses; even if it’s the wet nurse or parents returning home, they may carry the rough and malevolent energies of ghosts, or the foul breaths of livestock, which can all lead to disturbances. Children exhibit wheezing, or experience feeding difficulties, all of which are signs of such disturbances. </p>
<p>A wet nurse who is drunk or fatigued may transmit the worst effects to a nursing infant, which can potentially be fatal—caution is imperative! </p>
<p>In general, if one rides horses, the foul sweat and odor from the horse, without proper washing or changing of clothing, should be avoided near infants, as it may allow the child to be afflicted by the harmful breath of the horse. If a child sees a horse coming, or hears its neigh, or is exposed to the clothing and horse breath, all these can contribute to external disturbances. Caution must be exercised, especially with infants aged one year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is essential that children’s garments do not contain any hair, nor should their shoes. Wearing white clothing with green sashes or green clothing with white sashes can also lead to these disturbances.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Whenever abnormal individuals and various objects come from outside, it can also alarm young children and cause illness. To prevent this, when there are people coming from outside or if strange objects enter the household, one should keep the child away and not let them see these things. If avoidance is not possible, burning cow dung to produce constant smoke in front of the house is beneficial. </p>
<p>For children suffering from external factors, this illness can occur at any time. And when all children fall ill at the beginning of autumn, is it truly the case that all children are affected by external factors? The reason children are less sick in spring and winter and more prone to illness in autumn and summer is that during autumn and summer, the Yang energy of children is on the outside, and their blood vessels are delicate and weak. In early autumn and late summer, morning and evening can often bring sudden cold, which easily injures the vulnerable children, thus harming their Yang. When Yang is constrained, it leads to fevers, and when the stomach is cold, it causes diarrhea. Therefore, in late summer and early autumn, children are more likely to experience fevers and diarrhea not necessarily due to external factors. It is recommended that during late summer and early autumn, one should pay attention to the change in weather and keep warm.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>There are those who suffer from severe cold, and in their youth, they are often plagued by strong heat and diarrhea. Care must be taken not to treat this with purging first; one must first kill the poison before proceeding with purgation. The &quot;Xuan Zhong Ji&quot; states: In the world, there is a female bird called Guo, also known as the Daughter of the Heavenly Emperor, the Hidden Flying Bird, the Night-Wandering Maiden, and the Star-Fishing Ghost. This bird delights in passing through on rainy nights, flying and calling out, drawing people into the villages. It is purely female with no male counterpart, does not reproduce, and is spawned from toxic yin energy. It enjoys shedding feathers in the courtyards of people and placing them in children&#39;s clothing, causing the child to develop convulsions, which leads to certain death, effectively transforming into its child. Thus, children must not have their clothing exposed until they are ten years old, and this is especially to be avoided in July and August. In general, when one suffers from its influence, they tend to vomit or have diarrhea with colors of green, yellow, and white, with food and liquids being expelled, leading to abdominal pain and distress.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The complexion changes, and the symptoms resemble convulsions, but the eyes do not turn upward nor are there any ear symptoms; the pulse is rapid and numbered. It is appropriate to give Longdan Decoction, adding ginseng and angelica in equal proportions to the Longdan. </p>
<p>For children with internal heat, urgently check their mouths for swelling on both sides, which will likely have dark and swollen areas as big as a mung bean, either red, blue, or white. In such cases, they should promptly be needled to release the pressure, or alternatively, it can be squeezed out, and the wound should be cleaned with cotton to stop the bleeding. </p>
<p>For young children suffering from illness, they may vomit and have diarrhea with green, yellow, red, or white fluid, experience abdominal pain, and lie to the side, breathing as if they have convulsions, but their eyes will not turn upward, and they may sleep little. The complexion changes in five colors, and the pulse is tight and rapid. If not treated in time, it will become difficult to cure. </p>
<p>For treatment, mix fermented soybeans with water until damp, and mash them until smooth, forming balls the size of a chicken egg. Rub this on the child&#39;s forehead and palms and soles five or six times. Then, apply it to the child&#39;s heart area and around the navel, moving in a circular motion. After eating, if there are fine hairs observed in the discharge, throw the ball into the path of the discharge, and the pain will stop. </p>
<p>— Pediatric Essentials, Ming Dynasty, Wanquan<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Guest Disturbance</strong></p>
<p>The heart is startled, the mind is concealed; a child&#39;s heart is timid and weak. If they hear a loud noise or see strange objects or unfamiliar people, there is none who does not become disturbed, which is called &quot;guest disturbance.&quot; Guest disturbance manifests as foaming at the mouth with green, yellow, or white froth, a mixture of water and food, changes in facial color, wheezing and abdominal pain, tossing and turning, resembling shock or epilepsy, but without the eyes rolling upward or the ears being affected. The treatment should focus on dispelling evil influences and restoring proper vital energy, calming the mind, with remedies such as Suhe pills and the Supreme Life Preservation Elixir.</p>
<p>Guest disturbance refers to the illness caused by external energies interfering with one&#39;s own vital energy. For instance, if the five evils enter through the nose, they disturb the heart and liver; if the five flavors enter through the mouth, they disturb the spleen and stomach. If there is fear, it disturbs the spirit; if there is retaliation, it disturbs the intention, which must be broadly investigated. Thus, it is said: When the heart sincerely seeks, even if not immediately found, it is not far off.</p>
<p>Children are stubborn by nature; anything they are fond of, be it people or toys, must not be lost; losing them leads to worry, and worry injures the spleen, causing lethargy and lack of appetite. If what they seek cannot be obtained, they become angry; anger injures the liver, resulting in endless crying, which disturbs the heart. As for unfamiliar persons or objects, they should not be allowed to be seen; if seen, they cause shock, which harms the heart. Generally, unfamiliar people should not be allowed to come close; proximity causes fear, which injures the kidneys and may lead to epilepsy in the child; all of these are symptoms of guest disturbance.</p>
<p>Today, as parents, one should address what the child fears to calm them, just as elders stop nightly crying as per tradition. When a child refuses to take medicine, a doctor may use needles to stimulate them or moxibustion to compel them, leading to illness in the child.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Infant Questions by Lu Bosi from the Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>Wind Symptoms: Wind Heat<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>In children, wind strokes occur because their blood and qi are not yet stabilized, and there is a disorder of cold and warmth. Internally, there is excess heat and stagnation, while externally, the pores are open and empty, allowing the wind evil to invade. They display symptoms of confusion and lack of awareness, with high fever and erratic movements, coarse breathing, and clenched mouths with excessive salivation.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the heart, the child cannot turn or adjust their position while lying down, experiences fever and loss of voice, and has a dry, red tongue. If the face is flushed and sweating, it can be treated by moxibustion at the heart point. If there are white, black, green, or yellow patches between the lips, it suggests heart damage caused by water; or if the face and eyes are dark and twitching frequently, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the liver, the individual cannot lower their head while sitting, feels pain on the left side, has tight and contracted muscles, and experiences anger and eye strain, with blueish eyes. If the area around the eyes or the forehead is slightly bluish and the lips and face are blue and yellow, it can be treated by moxibustion at the liver point. If the eyes are one yellow and one white without treatment, it’s ineffective.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the kidneys, one may sit with a swollen face and experience pain that radiates to the lower abdomen, with black ears. If there is no yellow discoloration present, it can be treated by moxibustion at the kidney point. If the side feels like yellow earth, or if the hair is straight and the teeth are yellow and red, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the lungs, the individual may lie down with a full chest, experience rapid breathing and coughing, agitation, and sweating, with a pale nose. If the areas under the eyes, around the nose, and the lips are all white, it can be treated by moxibustion at the lung point. If there is yellow discoloration, it indicates lung damage caused by blood, and treatment is ineffective.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the spleen, one may sit with a full abdomen and twitching skin and flesh, with limbs that cannot retract. If the lips are yellow, or if the body turns uniformly yellow and the mouth produces salty saliva, it can be treated by moxibustion at the spleen point. If the hands and feet are blue and cold, it should not be treated.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>When a person is afflicted by wind evil, it typically enters through the five zang organs from the back. If the wind penetrates between the jaw and cheek, the mouth becomes crooked and the teeth clench. If the wind blocks the sounds in the throat, speech becomes difficult and may be lost. When wind collides with qi, and qi is obstructed by phlegm, the throat sounds like snoring. This wind first enters the skin and pores, then reaches the meridians, and affects the channels. If the sinews are chilled, they become tight and painful; if they are heated, they relax and do not respond. Wind combined with cold evil causes cramping and tightness; wind combined with heat causes relaxation. A tight and cramping pulse will be floating and tense, while a relaxed pulse will be floating and surging. For cold conditions, one should use the Lesser Continuity Life Decoction; for heat conditions, use the Wind-Chasing Powder to eliminate toxins. A floating pulse indicates an exterior pattern, a firm pulse indicates an interior pattern, and a rapid pulse indicates an upper pattern. For exterior patterns, disperse them; for interior patterns, resolve them; for upper patterns, induce them to flow out.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If one feels emptiness and cold, then the likes of black nightshade should not be neglected. The ancient methods of treatment, although primarily based on moxibustion and similar practices, should also consider the balance of energy and dosage. However, both wind and cold, as well as heat and dampness, can affect individuals, especially when one is susceptible to stroke caused by changes in weather. </p>
<p>When a person suddenly falls ill, nothing is more urgent than addressing a stroke. In a rushed situation, if one is unable to diagnose precisely, it is also necessary to clear the lower energy and resolve phlegm, as strokes are often due to phlegm accumulation and energy stagnation. Begin by using Tong Guan San to relieve it quickly, and then urgently prepare a decoction of Nanxing (Rhizoma Arisaematis), ginger, and wood incense for administration.</p>
<p>If the teeth are clenched, apply ground Nanxing and Xixin, mix with musk and the flesh of black plum, and rub it in; the teeth will open on their own. After administering the medicine, if phlegm resolves and energy descends, and the patient&#39;s condition slightly improves, carefully examine the external symptoms of the five organs and regulate accordingly, preferably with Fengfeng Tang or Qianghuo San. </p>
<p>For serious cases, choose from Fengfeng Tongsheng San, Huafeng Dan, Niuhuang San, Diao Teng San, or Zhibao Dan, among other remedies.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles of Past and Present</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reactions to Stimuli</strong></p>
<p>Generally, children follow their nature and should not be forced against their will. Any beloved object should not be taken from them by force. If their desires are not fulfilled, their spirits may become unsettled, leading to a disconnection of mind and energy, causing refusal to eat or speak, and resulting in a state resembling drunkenness, with limbs limp and appearing ill. When a physician observes such symptoms, they often find themselves at a loss. In such cases, it is necessary to inquire with the mother and those nearby, align with the child’s desires, and only then administer medication to ensure comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Heatstroke in Children</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from heatstroke, symptoms may include fever, sweating, increased thirst, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; some may exhibit a weak pulse with cold extremities and intense thirst. Others may experience agitation and nausea, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, potentially resembling symptoms of typhoid fever. It is crucial not to hastily prescribe medications for fright or typhoid but to use Wuling Powder or Liuhe Banxia Decoction to provide comfort without fail. If symptoms lean towards either cold or heat, medications should be used in accordance with the situation; strict adherence to a singular treatment approach is strongly discouraged.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty – Wang Kentang</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stroke</strong></p>
<p>The formulas by Zhang Huan et al. discuss stroke remedies, but I find that children are never afflicted by this condition. However, many treatments involve aromatic and drying ingredients, which could lead to blood heat generating wind, resembling stroke symptoms. Misapplication could cause serious harm, so I have entirely omitted them. Xue noted that stroke symptoms are present in the northwest. In the southeast, due to warm气, the pores are loose, and those who suffer from it all exhibit symptoms resembling stroke. Moreover, children have insufficient vital energy and their skin is not firm; they are easily affected by both deficiency and excess. When external pathogens invade, they can manifest as severe heat convulsions, coarse breathing, and excessive saliva, even leading to confusion and a locked jaw, resembling stroke. Using treatments like Shenming Decoction could be fatal. If adults do not truly experience this condition, how much less so for children? Any prior evidence must be evaluated. If Yangming channel has deficient qi and wind pathogens invade, causing tense sinews, this is an external cause. If Liver fire is excessive and sinews are particularly tense, it is an internal cause. Weak spleen and lungs lead to loose pores, allowing external pathogens to enter, or excessive fright from harsh medicinal substances damages liver blood. Loss of fluid after vomiting or diarrhea can prevent nurturing of the liver, leading to symptoms like a tilted mouth and eyes, all indicating insufficient liver blood and internal wind, resembling stroke symptoms.<br><strong>Partial wind and locked jaw.</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The condition of children with偏风 (an imbalance due to wind), relates to the lesser yang and the jueyin liver and gallbladder meridians. The term &quot;噤&quot; refers to muscle spasm caused by wind. When wood becomes overly abundant and affects the spleen, it triumphs over dampness, leading to excessive dryness in metal, as dry metal is associated with contraction and tension. Furthermore, it is said that wind as a disease moves well and transforms frequently, either to the left or to the right, with a singular cause, thus treatment must be precise and medicinal intervention is required. </p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of qi in the foot yangming stomach channel and the wind pathogen affects it, leading to tense muscles and meridians, this is due to external causes. If the wind-heat affects the spleen in the foot jueyin channel and causes a similar tension, this is due to internal causes. If both the spleen and lungs are weak, the pores are not tight, and external pathogens invade; or if one takes harsh mineral medicines that deplete liver blood, or experiences vomiting and diarrhea that lead to loss of body fluids and the inability to nourish the spleen, these can result in symptoms such as facial and eye distortion or hemiplegia. These indicate a deficiency of liver blood and the generation of wind from liver fire, suggesting the need to nourish kidney water, replenish liver blood, and strengthen spleen earth.</p>
<p>Treatment methods: For wind led by spleen and stomach deficiency, add Chai Hu (Bupleurum root) and Diaolongou (a traditional herb) to Yigong San. For spleen and lung deficiency with invading pathogens, use Diaolong Drink. For dry liver fire, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills). For insufficient body fluids, use Baizhu San (Atractylodes Powder). If there are accompanying symptoms such as tightness in the eyes, alternating chills and fever, scanty urination, a greenish complexion, and lateral rib discomfort, these indicate foundational diseases of the liver channel. If there are further symptoms of facial distortion, abdominal pain, reduced appetite, puffy eyelids, a cyanotic-yellow complexion, and generalized fatigue, these indicate liver wood affecting the spleen. </p>
<p>One should carefully assess the interactions of the five organs and address them. Should one hastily apply wind medications without proper understanding of the presenting symptoms, the condition may worsen.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The middle person conflicts.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Mr. Mao said: When a newborn child is delivered, if the baby appears with a bluish-black face, eyes closed, vomiting, and is unable to nurse, it indicates that due to external circumstances, outsiders have observed and inquired about the infant. It may be due to external influences, such as the mother’s unclean condition during her menstrual period, or being touched by a malevolent spirit. This situation arises when the baby is fed with milk containing evil influences, leading to incomplete development. Additionally, if the child is struck by wind evil, this condition may occur. As for treatment, one should first apply vermilion ointment to the breasts to help with nursing. Afterwards, one can use calming pills along with a digestive powder, and the child will recover. If the child continues to refuse to nurse and has a hard belly, it indicates imminent death. Generally, after the birth of a son, no one in the family should allow outsiders into the room to inquire about the child; each family has its own protective spirits. There is also concern about the woman’s body odor and menstrual uncleanliness affecting the child, which could result in negative impacts. This is the method for raising children.</p>
<p>Regarding being harmed by evil spirits:<br>Cao said: If a child is harmed by evil spirits, it is the malevolent energy of a ghost that suddenly afflicts the person. Regardless of size, if the balance of yin and yang is maintained, and the protective energies are harmonized, then no evil will affect the uprightness. If the vital essence is weak, the child becomes susceptible to ghostly toxic influences, which initially show no other illness but can suddenly lead to acute abdominal pain, confusion, and a desire to die. Generally, if the abdomen is large and full, and the pulse is tight and large, the child will die; if the pulse is tight, thin, and weak, there is hope for survival. If the energy stagnates and does not flow well through the organs, it can lead to further illness. Treatment: First administer Suhexiang pills; if the person is not revived, use the powdered soap pod for the nose. Blowing in a decoction of sandalwood that reduces qi, combined with ginseng and Poria, can also dispel evil. Guests who provoke should also take this treatment.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Death</strong></p>
<p>The Nest clan says: When a child dies suddenly, it is due to the Three Vacuities encountering a malicious wind, hence there is no illness leading to a sudden death. The Three Vacuities are: the decline of the year (1); the emptiness of the month (2); and the loss of the harmony of timing (3). Some individuals, due to these Three Vacuities, are additionally harmed by the malicious wind, causing the yin energy to deplete within while the yang energy is obstructed outside, resulting in congestion and a failure to harmonize yin and yang, thus leading to abrupt death. If the internal organs have not fully depleted, there may be a recovery after a long while; however, those possessing mixed energies from spirits must also expel the pathogenic influences before recovery is possible. Generally, when individuals face oppression or suddenly succumb to malignancy, and the pathogenic qi is not completely cleared, it can linger in the heart and abdomen for a long time before manifesting, often turning into a form of illness.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao states: The signs of sudden death include closed eyes, grinding teeth, body feeling like cotton, face turning blue-black, and coolness in the mouth and nose. These signs arise from a body once heated either due to being born or from shock. If a physician has consistently treated the fever without addressing the accumulation of shock and milk, it leads to an accumulation resulting from pathogenic qi overwhelming the body. </p>
<p>In the preceding cases, the primary issue is to identify the root of the initial ailment and to immediately treat it with life-saving powders, alongside vomiting and purging of phlegm. Once the patient awakens, administer two doses of Harmonizing Qi Powder to nourish and cleanse, followed by Cinnabar Ointment and Tranquil Heart Pills. If there is underlying heat at the time, give Major Atractylodes Powder and regulate for two to three days for comfort. The previous signs merely reflect general regulation. Concerning signs of illness, if one hears the call of crows or experiences spasms, sweating like pearls, inability to sleep, and tears coming from the eyes, this signifies imminent death, which is untreatable.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>On Possession by Spirits</strong></p>
<p>Chao said: Infants are fragile and weak, their spirit and essence slightly depleted, and their souls are often held by ghosts. They appear sluggish and tend to be weak and pale, crying frequently with a persistently foul breath. The &quot;Song of Ghost Possession&quot; from the &quot;Treasure Mirror for Infants&quot; states: Infants are weak and destined for misfortune; their souls are often affected by ghostly possession. Symptoms include weakness and frequent crying; there is no need for medicine, just seek a master. The &quot;Song of Ghostly Energy&quot; states: Ghostly energy resides within the skin, transmitting through the organs. It causes swelling resembling water diseases and convulsions like fright-induced epilepsy. Heat spreads throughout the body, and the heart is constricted with pain. If an infant shows these symptoms, medication must be sought urgently.</p>
<p><strong>On Sudden Illness</strong></p>
<p>Chao explained: The term &quot;sudden illness&quot; refers to the wind and ghostly energy lingering within a person&#39;s body. Regardless of age, if one’s blood and energy are weak, yin and yang become imbalanced, allowing wind and ghostly energy to invade and remain between the muscles, causing stagnation within the organs. This can lead to skin twitching, erratic symptoms, piercing pain in the abdomen, or febrile swelling which can become fatal. Moreover, sudden illness can easily affect others, which is why it is termed &quot;sudden.&quot; Infants should avoid exposure to wind and cold, as they often come into contact with it when their wet nurses do not protect them from temperature changes during nursing, or when they are carried in and out during different times of day. Their weak spirits are thus harmed by ghostly energy, leading to illness.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Corpse Affliction</strong> </p>
<p>Chao said: The &quot;Corpse Affliction&quot; is one of the five types of corpse ailments. Regardless of size, every person harbors corpse insects within their abdomen. These insects are inherently resentful and often attract external evils, collectively causing harm. Children with weak blood energy experience a decline in spirit, resulting in the illness known as corpse affliction, which manifests as heaviness and lethargy, making it difficult to pinpoint the illness&#39;s location. They may exhibit symptoms of chills or fever, and as time passes, it can lead to death. Once they die, it is also easy for the affliction to affect others, hence the name &quot;Corpse Affliction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Poisonous Affliction</strong> </p>
<p>Chao said: People gather various snakes and insects, placing them in a vessel to allow them to consume one another. The remaining survivor is termed &quot;poison&quot; and possesses the ability to transform, or it may enter the body through food, consuming the five internal organs. If a child is affected, the symptoms are similar to those in adults; they may experience stabbing pain and discomfort in the heart and abdomen. Those in acute distress may die immediately, while those in a milder state will gradually weaken over time, ultimately exhausting their energy and blood. If the heart becomes rotten, death follows, and this condition can also easily affect others, hence the term &quot;Poisonous Affliction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Horse Spleen Wind</strong> </p>
<p>Sudden wheezing and abdominal bloating occur. Tian said: Sudden wheezing is commonly referred to as &quot;Horse Spleen Wind.&quot; If there are difficulties with urination and defecation, it is advisable to expel it urgently using a life-saving powder made from cattle bile, followed by Bai Hu Decoction for stabilization. Horse Spleen Wind occurring within a hundred days is untreatable.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Hygiene</strong> </p>
<p><strong>On Wind Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s blood and qi are soft and weak, and their muscles are fragile. If there is an imbalance of cold and heat, the skin may be attacked by wind pathogens, first affecting the acupoints and then following the flow of qi and blood into the internal organs. Depending on where they are affected, this can lead to illness. The only organs that wind can enter are the heart and lungs, which are located above the diaphragm and in the spaces above; therefore, it is easy for wind to penetrate these areas, resulting in symptoms such as confusion, inability to respond, seizures in the limbs, a feeling of fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating, all of which are particularly urgent. </p>
<p>In general, the other internal organs are located beneath the diaphragm and are more solid, with their acupoints also located below, making it more difficult for wind to invade these areas, which is why patients do not present with symptoms. When wind enters the meridians, there are many diseases that manifest, and we will now consider those with symptoms. </p>
<p>Wind convulsions (also called wind spasms) occur when wind pathogens damage the Yang Meridian. This can arise from exposure or from umbilical sores that have not healed, leading to sudden convulsions characterized by a closed mouth, a stiff neck and body, ringing pain in the ears, and persistent confusion. The pulse feels tight and straight. Although this may appear similar to shock or epilepsy, if the child can regain softness and responsiveness at times, it indicates epilepsy. However, if they remain stiff and unresponsive, it indicates wind convulsions. Sudden stiffness of the body can lead to death.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If one experiences a bow-like bending of the back due to the wind injuring the yang channels, it causes a reverse bend, making it impossible to bend forward, resembling the shape of a bow. This condition is somewhat similar to convulsions; however, in convulsions, the body is rigid, whereas in this condition, the body is bent, hence the difference. </p>
<p>In cases where the mouth is locked due to a stroke, the tendons of the hand&#39;s three yang channels connect to the jaw and cheeks, while the tendons of the foot&#39;s yangming channel pass up and connect to the mouth. The wind evil enters through the yang channels, causing the mechanisms to contract and become dysfunctional, thus rendering the mouth unable to open.</p>
<p>When the pulse is slow, it indicates a stroke with rigidity and lack of response. The wind evil, along with cold and heat, enters the meridians, impacting the tendons and vessels; the tendons are affected by the evil—when cold, the limbs contract, and when hot, they become relaxed and unresponsive. A pulse that is rapid and thin indicates the tendons are tense and contracted. If the spleen pulse is weak and slow, the limbs will not respond.</p>
<p>When a stroke causes the mouth and eyes to tilt or droop, this results from the wind evil entering the tendons of the jaw and cheeks, causing the pulse to be somewhat rapid, which leads to the distortion of the mouth and eyes, making it impossible to look straight or speak properly. If the pulse is floating and slow, it is treatable.</p>
<p>There is also a saying: when lying at night with an open ear, wind can enter the ear and cause the mouth to become twisted. In cases of stroke where the patient is unresponsive, it is due to the wind evil first invading the yin, affecting the five organs, presenting suddenly, leading to unawareness of surroundings, producing sounds from the throat, a stiff tongue preventing speech, sweating with soft body, and the areas beneath the eyes, sides of the nose, and along the philtrum showing a white color—this is treatable. If one side is black and the other red, or if there is excessive salivation, the condition is difficult to treat; if there is no sweating and the body remains rigid, it is fatal.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>On the Three Types of Childhood Illness</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of illness in children: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ghost Illness</strong>: This occurs when a child&#39;s spirit and energy are weak. Due to constant handling and exposure to external environments, they are affected by malicious ghostly energies. Symptoms include painful skin sensations, intermittent wandering of discomfort, or stabbing pain in the chest and abdomen, leading to confusion and distress. This is termed being afflicted by evil spirits. In severe cases, it can result in death; in milder cases, it prolongs suffering, leading eventually to death and afflicting those nearby. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>House Illness</strong>: This is caused by internal parasites known as corpus worms. Children have delicate blood and energy, making them susceptible to external malignant influences that linger in the body. The symptoms include a heavy, vague feeling, unclear locations of pain, alternating between cold and hot sensations, or discomfort in the chest and abdomen. Over time, this can lead to death, affecting those nearby. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Poisonous Illness</strong>: Among various poisonous creatures, there is one that consumes the rest, known as gu (sorcery). This illness can arise from human actions or through external influences, entering a child&#39;s body through food. Symptoms include sharp abdominal pain, overwhelming distress, irregular bowel movements, or blood in stools. In urgent cases, this can lead to immediate death, termed poison from gu. In less severe cases, prolonged suffering ensues until the organs fail, resulting in death and affecting those nearby.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Prescription for Enhancing and Extending Life</strong></p>

<p>To treat children affected by gu poison, who experience hard stomach pain, with a pale yellow complexion and rigid bones, and for whom the illness varies: use two taels of peach tree mistletoe, pound finely, and sieve for powder, to be taken like tea, four to five times a day.

Use a vine to touch their nose for two hundred breaths; if the cow licks, they will heal. If the cow does not wish to lick, apply salt water to their face, and the cow will then lick.</p>
<p>To treat death from a nightmare with unawareness, it is necessary to be careful with the lighting and avoid anyone moving their hands. Touch the cow gently above to awaken them. If they cannot speak, take the head of a chicken from the east gate, powder it, and take it with wine.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>To treat sudden death: crush leek juice and pour it into the nostrils; for severe cases, pour it into both ears.</p>
<p>The Gè family&#39;s &quot;Zhou Hou Fang&quot; states: When a child dies suddenly and the limbs are not retracting, if there are signs of defecation, burn points one inch below the heart, three inches above the navel, and four inches below the navel, each with a hundred moxibustions. For younger children, adjust according to their age. Also, moxibustion on the area below the nose, known as the ghost&#39;s guest hall, also treats corpse qi. Xu Chunfu&#39;s &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Canon&quot; mentions: if a child suffers from prolonged intermittent fever, use three needles on the Sanfen point, and apply five moxibustions. Sanfen is located three inches from the wrist between the two tendons, corresponding to the heart protector pulse. For children with fright or convulsions, needle the Yinbai point one minute, applying three moxibustions. Yinbai is located on the inner side of the big toe, just below the nail, representing the spleen pulse. Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: the Gè family&#39;s elbow-back moxibustion method involves wrapping a rope around the elbows and wrists of the deceased: left for males, right for females, extending the rope from the back down from the large vertebra. From this point, apply moxibustion along the sides. This method, applying three moxibustions at each of the three points, can revive. If not reviving, roll the hand and apply moxibustion below the head according to age. Additionally, three moxibustions in the nose and ten moxibustions in the area beneath the jaw called Chengjiang are highly effective. Furthermore, apply seven moxibustions at the base of the toenails of both big toes for efficacy. This is the method of Hua Tuo, which some say requires thirty-seven moxibustions. Also, a hundred moxibustions at the navel.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Zhu You (Blessing and Healing)</strong></p>
<p>Sun Simiao in &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; says: For treating a child who has been afflicted by a guest spirit and is vomiting uncontrollably, apply moxibustion to the palms, the main pulse points, the hidden white point, and the three yin intersections, each using three strong applications. You can use powdered pills made like fermented beans. Also use saliva, spitting while reciting a spell. The incantation is: &quot;Father of the family, Mother of the family, the child is suffering; this guest spirit began with me. Even though Bian Que is good, he is not as good as the effective use of saliva.&quot; After reciting the spell, discard the pill in the middle of the road. [According to &quot;Standards for Clear Treatment,&quot; the powder is made into pills like fermented beans; apply saliva and massage the child’s hands, feet, heart, and abdomen, while using the spell for the guest spirit, which can be used for both the host and guest.]</p>
<p>Another method: Take a knife and lay it horizontally over the stove, remove the child’s clothes, and uncover the abdomen. Hold the knife towards the child while reciting an incantation, spit, and then point the knife towards the heart and abdomen, saying: &quot;Shining sun, rising in the east, turning from shadow to light. Lord Ge, Lord Ge, I do not know which lord; the child comes but does not look, leaves without care, exceeding the affliction of a living person. Dust on the beam is the spirit&#39;s trace; earth beneath the door is where the ghost travels. Great knife and horn against the stove spirit, two sevens of spit, guest spirit relieve the child’s fright.&quot; Spit again. Repeat this for twice seven times, using the knife to direct it and reciting the spell three times to complete, take these pills, break them open to check for hair, and discard them in the middle of the road; the guest spirit will then be healed.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Study</strong></p>
<p>The Wan family&#39;s &quot;Pediatric Insights&quot; states: A child, half a year old, suddenly appeared gloomy and unhappy, was in a deep sleep, and would not nurse. I said: The child&#39;s complexion shows no illness. If we speculate that it is an external attack of wind or cold, there are no signs of such an attack; if we suspect internal damage from food or milk, there is no evidence of internal injury either. This child seems to have no worries; if there were worries, it would harm the spleen, which is why he is in deep sleep and not nursing. His parents realized: There is a little boy who has been accompanying him; I sent him away three days ago. The wet nurse also said: Since that little boy left, he has not been happy and has not eaten. The father urgently ordered him to be called back. Upon seeing the boy, the child smiled. The father said: Without the wise techniques of the elder, this would not be understood.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　婴孺客忤</p>
<p>　　论曰：少小所以有客忤病者，是外人来气息忤之，一名中人，是为客忤也。虽是家人，或别房异户；虽是乳母及父母，或从外还，衣服经履鬼神粗暴恶气，或牛马之气，皆为忤也。执作喘息，乳气未定者，皆为客忤。其乳母遇醉及房劳喘后乳儿最剧，能杀儿也，不可不慎！凡诸乘马行，得马汗气臭，未盥洗易衣装，便向儿边，令儿中马客忤。儿卒见马来，及闻马鸣惊，及马上衣物马气，皆令小儿中马客忤。慎擭之，特重一岁儿也。凡小儿衣布帛绵中不得有头发，履中亦尔。白衣青带，青衣白带，皆令中忤。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>凡非常人及诸物从外来，亦惊小儿致病。欲防之法，诸有从外来人，及有异物入户，当将儿避之，勿令见也。若不避者，烧牛屎，令常有烟气置户前则善。　　小儿中客为病者，无时不有此病也。而秋初一切小儿皆病者，岂是一切小儿悉中客邪？夫小儿所以春冬少病、秋夏多病者，秋夏小儿阳气在外，血脉嫩弱，秋初夏末，晨夕时有暴冷，小儿嫩弱，其外则易伤暴冷折其阳，阳结则壮热，胃冷则下痢，是故夏末秋初，小儿多壮热而下痢也，未必皆是中客及鬾也。若治少小法，夏末秋初，常宜候天气温凉也。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>有暴寒卒冷者，其少小则多患壮热而下痢也，慎不可先下之，皆先杀毒后下之尔。《玄中记》云：天下有女鸟，名曰姑获，一名天帝女，一名隐飞鸟，一名夜行游女，又名钓星鬼，喜以阴雨夜过，飞鸣徘徊人村里唤得来者是也。鸟纯雌无雄，不产，阴气毒化生，喜落毛羽于人中庭，置儿衣中，便令儿作癎病，必死，即化为其儿也。是以小儿生至十岁，衣被不可露也。七八月尤忌。　　凡中客忤之为病，类皆吐下青黄白色，水谷解离，腹痛夭糾[夭糾　原作「大纠」，据《千金》卷五改。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>]，面色变易，其候似癎，但眼不上插耳，其脉急数者是也。宜与龙胆汤下之，加人参、当归，各如龙胆秤分等多少也。小儿中客，急视其口中悬痈左右，当有青黑肿脉核如麻豆大，或赤或青或白，如此便宜用针速刺溃去之，亦可爪摘决之，并以绵缠钗头拭去血也。少小中客之为病，吐下青黄赤白汁，腹中痛及反倒偃侧，喘似癎状，但目不上插少睡耳。面变五色，其脉弦急。若失时不治，少久则难治矣。欲疗之方，用豉数合，水拌令湿，捣熟，丸如鸡子大，以摩儿顖上、手足心各五六遍毕，以丸摩儿心及脐上下行转摩之，食顷破视其中当有细毛，即掷丸道中，痛即止。<br>　　　　幼科发挥 【明　万全】<br><a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　客忤</p>
<p>　　心主惊，心藏神，儿心气怯弱，或闻大声，见异物异人，未有不动其神也，谓之客忤。　　客忤者，口中吐青黄白沫，水谷鲜杂，面色变异，喘息腹痛，反侧瘈瘲，状似惊癎，但眼不上窜耳。治法宜辟邪正气，散惊安神，苏合丸、至圣保命丹主之。　　客忤者，谓客气忤犯主气之病也。如五气之邪，自鼻而入，则忤其心肝；五味之邪，自口而入，则忤其脾胃。有所惊恐则忤其神，有所拂逆则忤其意，当博求之。故曰：心诚求之，虽不中，不远矣。　　儿性执拗，凡平日亲爱之人，玩弄之物，不可失也，失则心思，思则伤脾，昏睡不食；求人不得则怒，怒则伤肝，啼哭不止，此忤其心也。平日未亲爱之人，未见之物，不可使之见，见则惊，惊则伤心。凡未见之人，不可使之近，迫近则恐，恐则伤肾，令儿成癎，此皆客忤病也。今之为父母者，则称所畏者以止之，如长老止夜啼之故事，为医者因儿不服药，则持针以搏，灸以迫之，令儿生病。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　婴童百问 【明　鲁伯嗣】</p>

<p>　　小儿中风者，以其血气未定，寒温失调，内则盛热蕴蓄，外则腠理开虚，故风邪乘其外虚而暴中之，其状昏不知人，壮热狂澡，搐掣气粗，口噤涎潮是也。心中风，则偃卧不能倾侧，发热失音，其舌焦赤，若汗流唇赤者可治，灸心俞。或唇间白黑青黄，乃心坏为水；或面目青黑，时时竦动者，并不治。肝中风，则踞坐不得低头，左胁疼痛，诸筋挛急，头目转动，上视多怒，其目青，若绕两目，连额微青，唇青面黄者可治，灸肝俞。大段青无，其目一黄一白，不治。肾中风，则踞坐面浮，腰脊痛引小腹，其耳黑，若两者未有黄色起者可治，灸肾俞。或胁间如黄土，发直而齿黄赤者，不治。肺中风，则偃卧胸满，喘急咳嗽，躁闷汗出，其鼻白，若目下至鼻四围及唇口皆白色，可治，灸肺俞。或色带黄，乃肺坏为血，不治。脾中风，则踞坐腹满，皮肉瞤动，四肢不收，其唇黄，若一身通黄，口吐咸涎者，可治，灸脾俞。或手足青而厥冷者，不治。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>凡人为风邪所中，皆自背上五脏俞而入，风入于颔颊之间，则口喎而牙噤，风塞于咽喉声音之间，则语不出而失音，风与气搏，气与痰隔，则喉间如鼾(鼻合)之声向。是风也，始入于肤腠，次达于经络，而搏于经脉，筋得寒则拘急挛痛，得热则缓弛不随；风挟寒邪，即挛急也；风挟热气，即缓弛也。拘挛脉必浮紧，缓弛脉必浮洪。寒者小续命汤，热者追风銼毒散之类。脉浮者病在表，脉实者病在里，脉促者病在上。在表者散之，在里者利之，在上者涌之。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>若虚而寒者，则乌附之类又不可缺。古人治法，虽以灼艾之类为本，亦当消息权度而投剂焉。虽然，风寒暑湿，皆能中人，况又有因气而中风者。人之骤病，莫急于中风，仓卒之际，若未能精审，且与下气豁痰，盖中风皆因痰郁气滞而作，先用通关散以疏之，急以南星、生姜、木香煎汤，调苏合香丸灌下。牙紧者，南星、细辛末，人麝香、乌梅肉点擦，牙自开。进药之后，痰消气下，病势稍苏，即详审五脏外证而调理之，宜省风汤羌活散。势甚者，防风通圣散、化风丹、牛黄散、钓藤散、至宝丹等剂，可选而用之。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　　　古今医统 【明　徐春甫】</p>

<p>　　小儿伏中暑证，发热汗出引饮，或吐泻霍乱肠痛；又有脉虚手足微寒发渴口热者；又有烦热而呕，吐利不食，至成搐搦如惊，状似伤寒者。不可便作惊病及伤寒用药，只可与五苓散、六和半夏汤，消息之，万无一失。有偏寒偏热者，以意用药，甚不可执一也。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>
<p>　　　　　中风</p>
<p>　　张涣等方，有中风方论，今见小儿绝无患者，而用药多犯香燥，恐血热生风，类中风证，误用之则为害不浅，故一切削而不载。薛氏云：中风之证，西北方有之。东南气温，腠理疏泄，人患之者，皆类中风也。况小儿元气未充，皮毛不固，易虚易实，外邪乘之，则壮热抽掣，气粗涎涌，甚至昏愦口噤，即似中风，误以续命等汤投之，多至不救。大人且无真中，况小儿乎？凡有前证，当辨其因。若阳明经气虚，风邪所乘，筋脉拘急者，为外因。足厥阴肝火炽盛，筋脉偏急者，为内因。脾肺虚弱，腠理不密，外邪乘入，或惊风过服金石之剂，耗损肝血，或吐泻后内亡津液，不能养肝，致口眼喎斜者，皆肝血不足，肝火生风之类，中风之类证也。<br>　　　　　偏风口噤<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<p>　　小儿偏风者，属少阳厥阴肝胆二经证也。噤者，筋急中风。木太盛而乘于脾，以胜水湿则金太燥，然燥金主于收敛劲切故也。又曰：风之为病，善行而数变，或左或右，其因一也，治须审而药之。若足阳明胃经气虚，风邪所乘，其筋脉偏急者，属外因。若足厥阴所经风热乘脾，筋脉偏急者，属内因。若脾肺虚弱，腠理不密，外邪所乘，或服金石之剂，耗损肝血，或吐泻后内亡津液，不能养脾，致口眼歪斜，或半身不遂诸证，皆属肝血不足，肝火生风，宜滋肾水，养肝血，壮脾土。治法：脾胃虚而动风者，异功散加柴胡、钓藤钩。脾肺虚而外邪所乘者，用钓藤饮。肝火血燥者，用六味地黄丸。津液不足者，用白朮散。若兼目紧上视，寒热往来，小便淋漓，面色带青，两胁胀痛之类，皆肝经之本病也。或唇口歪斜，腹痛少食，目泡浮肿，面色青黄，肢体倦怠之类，皆肝木乘脾之证也，当审五脏相胜而主之。设执其见证，概投风药，反成坏证者有矣。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　　　　中人忤<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<p>　　茅先生曰：小儿生下，犯人噤候，面青黑，合两眼闭，吐逆，不下乳，此候因生下来不免外人看问，或有腋气，或因妇人月信不净，或外人带邪神触着，生下来夹故乳哺，使触异气之物，气血未就，又被风邪所击致此。治者，先用朱砂膏乳上吮下，后用镇心丸夹醒脾散与服，即愈。如见不下乳，眼视肚硬，死候。大凡初生下儿子，家中人不见，不可便与外人入房看问，人家各有神只。又恐妇人腋气及月信不净，触着恐中客忤，此即是养儿之法。<br>　　　　　中恶</p>
<p>　　巢氏曰：小儿中恶者，是鬼邪之气，卒中于人也。无问大小，若阴阳顺理，荣卫平调，神守强则邪不干正。若精气衰弱，则鬼毒恶气中之，其状先无他病，卒然心腹刺痛，闷乱欲死是也。凡中恶腹大而满，脉紧大而浮者死，紧细而微者生。余势不尽，停滞脏腑之间，更发后变为疰也。　　治法：先下苏合香丸；未醒，以皂角末搐鼻。吹服沉香降气汤加人参、茯苓，又能辟邪。客忤亦宜服。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　　　　卒死</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：小儿卒死者，是三虚而遇贼风，故无病仓卒而死也。三虚者，乘年之衰，一也；逢月之空，二也；失时之和，三也。有人因此三虚，复为贼风所伤，使阴气偏竭于内，阳气阻隔于外，而气壅闭，阴阳不通，故暴绝而死也。若脏腑未竭，良久乃苏，亦有兼挟鬼神气者，皆须邪退乃生也。凡中客忤，及中恶卒死，而邪气不尽，停蓄心腹，久乃发动，多变成疰也。　　茅先生云：率死候，眼合哜齿，遍身如绵，面青黑，口鼻冷，此候本因生下而遍身热，或因有惊患，医人一向退热，不曾下得惊积及奶积，遂积聚被邪气至此。　　右前件三　候都来，一般只是要辨元初受患根源，治之急下夺命散，与吐下风涎。　　醒后，便下匀气散二服补除，后下朱砂膏、镇心丸与服。如有伏热来时，即下大附散与调理二三日，安乐。前件三　形候，只是此一般调理。上件疾见鸦声上啼，偏搐，汗如珠，不得睡，眼障泪出，死候，不治。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　　鬼持</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：小儿神氟软弱，精爽微羸，而神魂被鬼所持，其状不觉有余，疾直尔痿黄，多大啼唤，口气常臭是也。　　《婴童宝鉴》小儿鬼持歌云：小儿气弱命中衰，魂魄多应被鬼持。其候痿黄多哭啼，不须用药可求师。　　鬼气歌云：鬼气皮肤里，相传脏腑间。肿虚如水病，瘈瘲似惊癎。热发浑身濇，心挛痛所攒。小儿还有此，服药急须看。<br>　　　　　疰病</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：疰之言住也，谓其风邪鬼气留人身内也。人无问大小，若血气虚衰，则阴阳失守，风邪鬼气因而客之，留住肌肉之间，连滞脏腑之内，或皮肤掣动，游易无常，成心腹刺痛，或体热皮肿，沉滞至死，死又疰易傍人，故为疰也。小儿不能触冒风邪，多因乳母解脱之时，不避温凉暑湿，或抱持出入早晚，其神魂软弱，而为鬼气所伤，故病也。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>　　　　　尸疰</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：尸疰者，是五尸之中，一尸疰也。人无问小大，腹内皆有尸虫，尸虫为性忌恶，多接引外邪，共为患害。小儿血气衰弱者，精神亦羸，故尸疰因而为病，其状沉嘿，不的知病之处，或寒热淋漓，涉引岁月，遂至于死，死又疰易傍人，故名之为尸疰也。　　张涣论小儿亦有疰病，与大人所病无异，久后疰易傍人，传染骨肉，如尸疰蛊毒之类是也。<br>　　　　　蛊疰</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：人聚蛇虫杂类，以器皿盛之，令相啖食，余一存者，即名为蛊，能变化，或随饮食入腹，食人五脏。小儿有中者，病状与大人老子无异，则心腹刺痛懊闷，急者即死，缓者涉历岁月，渐深羸困，食心脏，尽利血，心脏烂乃死，死又疰易傍人，故为蛊疰也。<br>　　　　　马脾风</p>
<p>　　暴喘而胀满也。<br>　　田氏云：暴喘，俗传为马脾风也。大小便哽，宜急下之，用牛黄夺命散，后用白虎汤平之。　　马脾风，在百日内者不治。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 424: Disorders of Infants</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infant Disorders Caused by External Influences</strong></p>
<p>It is said: The reason why young children experience disorders from external influences is due to the harmful breaths brought by outsiders, referred to as &#39;guests,&#39; thus causing disturbances. Even if they are family members, such as those from different houses; even if it’s the wet nurse or parents returning home, they may carry the rough and malevolent energies of ghosts, or the foul breaths of livestock, which can all lead to disturbances. Children exhibit wheezing, or experience feeding difficulties, all of which are signs of such disturbances. </p>
<p>A wet nurse who is drunk or fatigued may transmit the worst effects to a nursing infant, which can potentially be fatal—caution is imperative! </p>
<p>In general, if one rides horses, the foul sweat and odor from the horse, without proper washing or changing of clothing, should be avoided near infants, as it may allow the child to be afflicted by the harmful breath of the horse. If a child sees a horse coming, or hears its neigh, or is exposed to the clothing and horse breath, all these can contribute to external disturbances. Caution must be exercised, especially with infants aged one year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is essential that children’s garments do not contain any hair, nor should their shoes. Wearing white clothing with green sashes or green clothing with white sashes can also lead to these disturbances.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Whenever abnormal individuals and various objects come from outside, it can also alarm young children and cause illness. To prevent this, when there are people coming from outside or if strange objects enter the household, one should keep the child away and not let them see these things. If avoidance is not possible, burning cow dung to produce constant smoke in front of the house is beneficial. </p>
<p>For children suffering from external factors, this illness can occur at any time. And when all children fall ill at the beginning of autumn, is it truly the case that all children are affected by external factors? The reason children are less sick in spring and winter and more prone to illness in autumn and summer is that during autumn and summer, the Yang energy of children is on the outside, and their blood vessels are delicate and weak. In early autumn and late summer, morning and evening can often bring sudden cold, which easily injures the vulnerable children, thus harming their Yang. When Yang is constrained, it leads to fevers, and when the stomach is cold, it causes diarrhea. Therefore, in late summer and early autumn, children are more likely to experience fevers and diarrhea not necessarily due to external factors. It is recommended that during late summer and early autumn, one should pay attention to the change in weather and keep warm.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are those who suffer from severe cold, and in their youth, they are often plagued by strong heat and diarrhea. Care must be taken not to treat this with purging first; one must first kill the poison before proceeding with purgation. The &quot;Xuan Zhong Ji&quot; states: In the world, there is a female bird called Guo, also known as the Daughter of the Heavenly Emperor, the Hidden Flying Bird, the Night-Wandering Maiden, and the Star-Fishing Ghost. This bird delights in passing through on rainy nights, flying and calling out, drawing people into the villages. It is purely female with no male counterpart, does not reproduce, and is spawned from toxic yin energy. It enjoys shedding feathers in the courtyards of people and placing them in children&#39;s clothing, causing the child to develop convulsions, which leads to certain death, effectively transforming into its child. Thus, children must not have their clothing exposed until they are ten years old, and this is especially to be avoided in July and August. In general, when one suffers from its influence, they tend to vomit or have diarrhea with colors of green, yellow, and white, with food and liquids being expelled, leading to abdominal pain and distress.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>For children with internal heat, urgently check their mouths for swelling on both sides, which will likely have dark and swollen areas as big as a mung bean, either red, blue, or white. In such cases, they should promptly be needled to release the pressure, or alternatively, it can be squeezed out, and the wound should be cleaned with cotton to stop the bleeding. </p>
<p>For young children suffering from illness, they may vomit and have diarrhea with green, yellow, red, or white fluid, experience abdominal pain, and lie to the side, breathing as if they have convulsions, but their eyes will not turn upward, and they may sleep little.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guest Disturbance</strong></p>
<p>The heart is startled, the mind is concealed; a child&#39;s heart is timid and weak. If they hear a loud noise or see strange objects or unfamiliar people, there is none who does not become disturbed, which is called &quot;guest disturbance.&quot; Guest disturbance manifests as foaming at the mouth with green, yellow, or white froth, a mixture of water and food, changes in facial color, wheezing and abdominal pain, tossing and turning, resembling shock or epilepsy, but without the eyes rolling upward or the ears being affected. The treatment should focus on dispelling evil influences and restoring proper vital energy, calming the mind, with remedies such as Suhe pills and the Supreme Life Preservation Elixir.</p>
<p>Guest disturbance refers to the illness caused by external energies interfering with one&#39;s own vital energy. For instance, if the five evils enter through the nose, they disturb the heart and liver; if the five flavors enter through the mouth, they disturb the spleen and stomach. If there is fear, it disturbs the spirit; if there is retaliation, it disturbs the intention, which must be broadly investigated. Thus, it is said: When the heart sincerely seeks, even if not immediately found, it is not far off.</p>
<p>Children are stubborn by nature; anything they are fond of, be it people or toys, must not be lost; losing them leads to worry, and worry injures the spleen, causing lethargy and lack of appetite. If what they seek cannot be obtained, they become angry; anger injures the liver, resulting in endless crying, which disturbs the heart. As for unfamiliar persons or objects, they should not be allowed to be seen; if seen, they cause shock, which harms the heart. Generally, unfamiliar people should not be allowed to come close; proximity causes fear, which injures the kidneys and may lead to epilepsy in the child; all of these are symptoms of guest disturbance.</p>
<p>Today, as parents, one should address what the child fears to calm them, just as elders stop nightly crying as per tradition. When a child refuses to take medicine, a doctor may use needles to stimulate them or moxibustion to compel them, leading to illness in the child.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In children, wind strokes occur because their blood and qi are not yet stabilized, and there is a disorder of cold and warmth. Internally, there is excess heat and stagnation, while externally, the pores are open and empty, allowing the wind evil to invade. They display symptoms of confusion and lack of awareness, with high fever and erratic movements, coarse breathing, and clenched mouths with excessive salivation.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the heart, the child cannot turn or adjust their position while lying down, experiences fever and loss of voice, and has a dry, red tongue. If the face is flushed and sweating, it can be treated by moxibustion at the heart point. If there are white, black, green, or yellow patches between the lips, it suggests heart damage caused by water; or if the face and eyes are dark and twitching frequently, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the liver, the individual cannot lower their head while sitting, feels pain on the left side, has tight and contracted muscles, and experiences anger and eye strain, with blueish eyes. If the area around the eyes or the forehead is slightly bluish and the lips and face are blue and yellow, it can be treated by moxibustion at the liver point. If the eyes are one yellow and one white without treatment, it’s ineffective.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the kidneys, one may sit with a swollen face and experience pain that radiates to the lower abdomen, with black ears. If there is no yellow discoloration present, it can be treated by moxibustion at the kidney point. If the side feels like yellow earth, or if the hair is straight and the teeth are yellow and red, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>When there is wind in the lungs, the individual may lie down with a full chest, experience rapid breathing and coughing, agitation, and sweating, with a pale nose. If the areas under the eyes, around the nose, and the lips are all white, it can be treated by moxibustion at the lung point. If there is yellow discoloration, it indicates lung damage caused by blood, and treatment is ineffective.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person is afflicted by wind evil, it typically enters through the five zang organs from the back. If the wind penetrates between the jaw and cheek, the mouth becomes crooked and the teeth clench. If the wind blocks the sounds in the throat, speech becomes difficult and may be lost. When wind collides with qi, and qi is obstructed by phlegm, the throat sounds like snoring. This wind first enters the skin and pores, then reaches the meridians, and affects the channels. If the sinews are chilled, they become tight and painful; if they are heated, they relax and do not respond. Wind combined with cold evil causes cramping and tightness; wind combined with heat causes relaxation. A tight and cramping pulse will be floating and tense, while a relaxed pulse will be floating and surging. For cold conditions, one should use the Lesser Continuity Life Decoction; for heat conditions, use the Wind-Chasing Powder to eliminate toxins. A floating pulse indicates an exterior pattern, a firm pulse indicates an interior pattern, and a rapid pulse indicates an upper pattern. For exterior patterns, disperse them; for interior patterns, resolve them; for upper patterns, induce them to flow out.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Reactions to Stimuli</strong></p>
<p>Generally, children follow their nature and should not be forced against their will. Any beloved object should not be taken from them by force. If their desires are not fulfilled, their spirits may become unsettled, leading to a disconnection of mind and energy, causing refusal to eat or speak, and resulting in a state resembling drunkenness, with limbs limp and appearing ill. When a physician observes such symptoms, they often find themselves at a loss. In such cases, it is necessary to inquire with the mother and those nearby, align with the child’s desires, and only then administer medication to ensure comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Heatstroke in Children</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from heatstroke, symptoms may include fever, sweating, increased thirst, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; some may exhibit a weak pulse with cold extremities and intense thirst. Others may experience agitation and nausea, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, potentially resembling symptoms of typhoid fever. It is crucial not to hastily prescribe medications for fright or typhoid but to use Wuling Powder or Liuhe Banxia Decoction to provide comfort without fail. If symptoms lean towards either cold or heat, medications should be used in accordance with the situation; strict adherence to a singular treatment approach is strongly discouraged.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty – Wang Kentang</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stroke</strong></p>
<p>The formulas by Zhang Huan et al. discuss stroke remedies, but I find that children are never afflicted by this condition. However, many treatments involve aromatic and drying ingredients, which could lead to blood heat generating wind, resembling stroke symptoms. Misapplication could cause serious harm, so I have entirely omitted them. Xue noted that stroke symptoms are present in the northwest. In the southeast, due to warm气, the pores are loose, and those who suffer from it all exhibit symptoms resembling stroke. Moreover, children have insufficient vital energy and their skin is not firm; they are easily affected by both deficiency and excess. When external pathogens invade, they can manifest as severe heat convulsions, coarse breathing, and excessive saliva, even leading to confusion and a locked jaw, resembling stroke. Using treatments like Shenming Decoction could be fatal. If adults do not truly experience this condition, how much less so for children? Any prior evidence must be evaluated. If Yangming channel has deficient qi and wind pathogens invade, causing tense sinews, this is an external cause. If Liver fire is excessive and sinews are particularly tense, it is an internal cause. Weak spleen and lungs lead to loose pores, allowing external pathogens to enter, or excessive fright from harsh medicinal substances damages liver blood. Loss of fluid after vomiting or diarrhea can prevent nurturing of the liver, leading to symptoms like a tilted mouth and eyes, all indicating insufficient liver blood and internal wind, resembling stroke symptoms.<br><strong>Partial wind and locked jaw.</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of children with偏风 (an imbalance due to wind), relates to the lesser yang and the jueyin liver and gallbladder meridians. The term &quot;噤&quot; refers to muscle spasm caused by wind. When wood becomes overly abundant and affects the spleen, it triumphs over dampness, leading to excessive dryness in metal, as dry metal is associated with contraction and tension. Furthermore, it is said that wind as a disease moves well and transforms frequently, either to the left or to the right, with a singular cause, thus treatment must be precise and medicinal intervention is required. </p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of qi in the foot yangming stomach channel and the wind pathogen affects it, leading to tense muscles and meridians, this is due to external causes. If the wind-heat affects the spleen in the foot jueyin channel and causes a similar tension, this is due to internal causes. If both the spleen and lungs are weak, the pores are not tight, and external pathogens invade; or if one takes harsh mineral medicines that deplete liver blood, or experiences vomiting and diarrhea that lead to loss of body fluids and the inability to nourish the spleen, these can result in symptoms such as facial and eye distortion or hemiplegia. These indicate a deficiency of liver blood and the generation of wind from liver fire, suggesting the need to nourish kidney water, replenish liver blood, and strengthen spleen earth.</p>
<p>Treatment methods: For wind led by spleen and stomach deficiency, add Chai Hu (Bupleurum root) and Diaolongou (a traditional herb) to Yigong San. For spleen and lung deficiency with invading pathogens, use Diaolong Drink. For dry liver fire, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills). For insufficient body fluids, use Baizhu San (Atractylodes Powder). If there are accompanying symptoms such as tightness in the eyes, alternating chills and fever, scanty urination, a greenish complexion, and lateral rib discomfort, these indicate foundational diseases of the liver channel. If there are further symptoms of facial distortion, abdominal pain, reduced appetite, puffy eyelids, a cyanotic-yellow complexion, and generalized fatigue, these indicate liver wood affecting the spleen. </p>
<p>One should carefully assess the interactions of the five organs and address them. Should one hastily apply wind medications without proper understanding of the presenting symptoms, the condition may worsen.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Mao said: When a newborn child is delivered, if the baby appears with a bluish-black face, eyes closed, vomiting, and is unable to nurse, it indicates that due to external circumstances, outsiders have observed and inquired about the infant. It may be due to external influences, such as the mother’s unclean condition during her menstrual period, or being touched by a malevolent spirit. This situation arises when the baby is fed with milk containing evil influences, leading to incomplete development. Additionally, if the child is struck by wind evil, this condition may occur. As for treatment, one should first apply vermilion ointment to the breasts to help with nursing. Afterwards, one can use calming pills along with a digestive powder, and the child will recover. If the child continues to refuse to nurse and has a hard belly, it indicates imminent death. Generally, after the birth of a son, no one in the family should allow outsiders into the room to inquire about the child; each family has its own protective spirits. There is also concern about the woman’s body odor and menstrual uncleanliness affecting the child, which could result in negative impacts. This is the method for raising children.</p>
<p>Regarding being harmed by evil spirits:<br>Cao said: If a child is harmed by evil spirits, it is the malevolent energy of a ghost that suddenly afflicts the person. Regardless of size, if the balance of yin and yang is maintained, and the protective energies are harmonized, then no evil will affect the uprightness. If the vital essence is weak, the child becomes susceptible to ghostly toxic influences, which initially show no other illness but can suddenly lead to acute abdominal pain, confusion, and a desire to die. Generally, if the abdomen is large and full, and the pulse is tight and large, the child will die; if the pulse is tight, thin, and weak, there is hope for survival. If the energy stagnates and does not flow well through the organs, it can lead to further illness. Treatment: First administer Suhexiang pills; if the person is not revived, use the powdered soap pod for the nose. Blowing in a decoction of sandalwood that reduces qi, combined with ginseng and Poria, can also dispel evil. Guests who provoke should also take this treatment.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Death</strong></p>
<p>The Nest clan says: When a child dies suddenly, it is due to the Three Vacuities encountering a malicious wind, hence there is no illness leading to a sudden death. The Three Vacuities are: the decline of the year (1); the emptiness of the month (2); and the loss of the harmony of timing (3). Some individuals, due to these Three Vacuities, are additionally harmed by the malicious wind, causing the yin energy to deplete within while the yang energy is obstructed outside, resulting in congestion and a failure to harmonize yin and yang, thus leading to abrupt death. If the internal organs have not fully depleted, there may be a recovery after a long while; however, those possessing mixed energies from spirits must also expel the pathogenic influences before recovery is possible. Generally, when individuals face oppression or suddenly succumb to malignancy, and the pathogenic qi is not completely cleared, it can linger in the heart and abdomen for a long time before manifesting, often turning into a form of illness.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao states: The signs of sudden death include closed eyes, grinding teeth, body feeling like cotton, face turning blue-black, and coolness in the mouth and nose. These signs arise from a body once heated either due to being born or from shock. If a physician has consistently treated the fever without addressing the accumulation of shock and milk, it leads to an accumulation resulting from pathogenic qi overwhelming the body. </p>
<p>In the preceding cases, the primary issue is to identify the root of the initial ailment and to immediately treat it with life-saving powders, alongside vomiting and purging of phlegm. Once the patient awakens, administer two doses of Harmonizing Qi Powder to nourish and cleanse, followed by Cinnabar Ointment and Tranquil Heart Pills. If there is underlying heat at the time, give Major Atractylodes Powder and regulate for two to three days for comfort. The previous signs merely reflect general regulation. Concerning signs of illness, if one hears the call of crows or experiences spasms, sweating like pearls, inability to sleep, and tears coming from the eyes, this signifies imminent death, which is untreatable.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Possession by Spirits</strong></p>
<p>Chao said: Infants are fragile and weak, their spirit and essence slightly depleted, and their souls are often held by ghosts. They appear sluggish and tend to be weak and pale, crying frequently with a persistently foul breath. The &quot;Song of Ghost Possession&quot; from the &quot;Treasure Mirror for Infants&quot; states: Infants are weak and destined for misfortune; their souls are often affected by ghostly possession. Symptoms include weakness and frequent crying; there is no need for medicine, just seek a master. The &quot;Song of Ghostly Energy&quot; states: Ghostly energy resides within the skin, transmitting through the organs. It causes swelling resembling water diseases and convulsions like fright-induced epilepsy. Heat spreads throughout the body, and the heart is constricted with pain. If an infant shows these symptoms, medication must be sought urgently.</p>
<p><strong>On Sudden Illness</strong></p>
<p>Chao explained: The term &quot;sudden illness&quot; refers to the wind and ghostly energy lingering within a person&#39;s body. Regardless of age, if one’s blood and energy are weak, yin and yang become imbalanced, allowing wind and ghostly energy to invade and remain between the muscles, causing stagnation within the organs. This can lead to skin twitching, erratic symptoms, piercing pain in the abdomen, or febrile swelling which can become fatal. Moreover, sudden illness can easily affect others, which is why it is termed &quot;sudden.&quot; Infants should avoid exposure to wind and cold, as they often come into contact with it when their wet nurses do not protect them from temperature changes during nursing, or when they are carried in and out during different times of day. Their weak spirits are thus harmed by ghostly energy, leading to illness.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Corpse Affliction</strong> </p>
<p>Chao said: The &quot;Corpse Affliction&quot; is one of the five types of corpse ailments. Regardless of size, every person harbors corpse insects within their abdomen. These insects are inherently resentful and often attract external evils, collectively causing harm. Children with weak blood energy experience a decline in spirit, resulting in the illness known as corpse affliction, which manifests as heaviness and lethargy, making it difficult to pinpoint the illness&#39;s location. They may exhibit symptoms of chills or fever, and as time passes, it can lead to death. Once they die, it is also easy for the affliction to affect others, hence the name &quot;Corpse Affliction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Poisonous Affliction</strong> </p>
<p>Chao said: People gather various snakes and insects, placing them in a vessel to allow them to consume one another. The remaining survivor is termed &quot;poison&quot; and possesses the ability to transform, or it may enter the body through food, consuming the five internal organs. If a child is affected, the symptoms are similar to those in adults; they may experience stabbing pain and discomfort in the heart and abdomen. Those in acute distress may die immediately, while those in a milder state will gradually weaken over time, ultimately exhausting their energy and blood. If the heart becomes rotten, death follows, and this condition can also easily affect others, hence the term &quot;Poisonous Affliction.&quot;</p>

<p>Children&#39;s blood and qi are soft and weak, and their muscles are fragile. If there is an imbalance of cold and heat, the skin may be attacked by wind pathogens, first affecting the acupoints and then following the flow of qi and blood into the internal organs. Depending on where they are affected, this can lead to illness. The only organs that wind can enter are the heart and lungs, which are located above the diaphragm and in the spaces above; therefore, it is easy for wind to penetrate these areas, resulting in symptoms such as confusion, inability to respond, seizures in the limbs, a feeling of fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating, all of which are particularly urgent. </p>
<p>In general, the other internal organs are located beneath the diaphragm and are more solid, with their acupoints also located below, making it more difficult for wind to invade these areas, which is why patients do not present with symptoms. When wind enters the meridians, there are many diseases that manifest, and we will now consider those with symptoms. </p>
<p>Wind convulsions (also called wind spasms) occur when wind pathogens damage the Yang Meridian. This can arise from exposure or from umbilical sores that have not healed, leading to sudden convulsions characterized by a closed mouth, a stiff neck and body, ringing pain in the ears, and persistent confusion. The pulse feels tight and straight. Although this may appear similar to shock or epilepsy, if the child can regain softness and responsiveness at times, it indicates epilepsy. However, if they remain stiff and unresponsive, it indicates wind convulsions. Sudden stiffness of the body can lead to death.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one experiences a bow-like bending of the back due to the wind injuring the yang channels, it causes a reverse bend, making it impossible to bend forward, resembling the shape of a bow. This condition is somewhat similar to convulsions; however, in convulsions, the body is rigid, whereas in this condition, the body is bent, hence the difference. </p>
<p>In cases where the mouth is locked due to a stroke, the tendons of the hand&#39;s three yang channels connect to the jaw and cheeks, while the tendons of the foot&#39;s yangming channel pass up and connect to the mouth. The wind evil enters through the yang channels, causing the mechanisms to contract and become dysfunctional, thus rendering the mouth unable to open.</p>
<p>When the pulse is slow, it indicates a stroke with rigidity and lack of response. The wind evil, along with cold and heat, enters the meridians, impacting the tendons and vessels; the tendons are affected by the evil—when cold, the limbs contract, and when hot, they become relaxed and unresponsive. A pulse that is rapid and thin indicates the tendons are tense and contracted. If the spleen pulse is weak and slow, the limbs will not respond.</p>
<p>When a stroke causes the mouth and eyes to tilt or droop, this results from the wind evil entering the tendons of the jaw and cheeks, causing the pulse to be somewhat rapid, which leads to the distortion of the mouth and eyes, making it impossible to look straight or speak properly. If the pulse is floating and slow, it is treatable.</p>
<p>There is also a saying: when lying at night with an open ear, wind can enter the ear and cause the mouth to become twisted. In cases of stroke where the patient is unresponsive, it is due to the wind evil first invading the yin, affecting the five organs, presenting suddenly, leading to unawareness of surroundings, producing sounds from the throat, a stiff tongue preventing speech, sweating with soft body, and the areas beneath the eyes, sides of the nose, and along the philtrum showing a white color—this is treatable. If one side is black and the other red, or if there is excessive salivation, the condition is difficult to treat; if there is no sweating and the body remains rigid, it is fatal.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Three Types of Childhood Illness</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of illness in children: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ghost Illness</strong>: This occurs when a child&#39;s spirit and energy are weak. Due to constant handling and exposure to external environments, they are affected by malicious ghostly energies. Symptoms include painful skin sensations, intermittent wandering of discomfort, or stabbing pain in the chest and abdomen, leading to confusion and distress. This is termed being afflicted by evil spirits. In severe cases, it can result in death; in milder cases, it prolongs suffering, leading eventually to death and afflicting those nearby. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>House Illness</strong>: This is caused by internal parasites known as corpus worms. Children have delicate blood and energy, making them susceptible to external malignant influences that linger in the body. The symptoms include a heavy, vague feeling, unclear locations of pain, alternating between cold and hot sensations, or discomfort in the chest and abdomen. Over time, this can lead to death, affecting those nearby. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Poisonous Illness</strong>: Among various poisonous creatures, there is one that consumes the rest, known as gu (sorcery). This illness can arise from human actions or through external influences, entering a child&#39;s body through food. Symptoms include sharp abdominal pain, overwhelming distress, irregular bowel movements, or blood in stools. In urgent cases, this can lead to immediate death, termed poison from gu. In less severe cases, prolonged suffering ensues until the organs fail, resulting in death and affecting those nearby.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p>

<p>These nine ingredients, with the aconite treated separately like fat, should be crushed and mixed well, stored tightly in a copper container without leakage. In case of urgent illness, take a spoonful of the mixture with water, possibly increasing to half a spoonful; for smaller children, take only half. If pain is in the head, it may result in nosebleeds; if in the diaphragm above, it causes vomiting; if below, it leads to diarrhea. For limbs, it should result in sweating.

<p>For infants, whose qi and blood are not yet fully developed, their spirit is weak. Aside from the regular care provided by their parents and wet nurses, they should not be allowed to see living beings, be taken to other rooms or different houses, nor see cattle, horses, or other livestock. Relatives and family members returning home at night should also not see the child, for fear of encountering harsh and violent spirits which may harm the child. If affected, the child may vomit hollow fluids of green, yellow, red, and white, resembling symptoms of a convulsion but without eye rolling or a tight pulse; this is called &quot;Guest Obstruction.&quot;</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child with a flying corpse and running horse: Use two seeds each of kernelless ba dou (croton seed) and peeled almond, crush them finely, mix them together, add two cups of hot soup, and take the resulting white liquid. Should improve immediately. If not healed, take another dose, adjusting the amount based on the child&#39;s size. This is effective for trauma caused by spirits and can be kept for regular use. Avoid wild boar meat and asparagus.</p>
<p>When a child suddenly has a blue-black belly, it indicates a failure in blood circulation, with wind and cold entering, which is a dangerous sign. Grind big cyan and take it orally with wine.</p>
<p>For a child suffering from heat stroke, vomiting, diarrhea, and extreme thirst: Burn the herb gǔ jīng cǎo (rice paddy herb) to preserve its essence, cover it with a container, let it cool, grind it into powder, and take half a qian with cool rice drink.</p>
<p>To treat five types of poisonous curses in children: Grind the root of the horsebell vine into a fine powder; take one qian with a small cup of water, boil it for five minutes, and take it on an empty stomach in one go. The poison will come out immediately; if not, take another dose. Alternatively, take a piece of burnt drum skin, grind it into fine ash, mix one qian with plain porridge, and take it on an empty stomach. The patient should call out the name of the curse&#39;s master, and the condition will improve. Also: Take one liang of jì li (wild cress), grind it into powder, stir it into porridge to take one qian, and adjust dosage based on the child’s size.</p>
<p>For a child fearful of curses and feeling like they might die: Use half a liang of raw licorice, boil it with one medium cup of water until reduced by half, strain it, and divide into two doses to expel the curse.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If in life one anticipates being affected by poison (gu), it is advisable to prepare and boil honey-fried licorice, and take the juice. This will detoxify internally without causing vomiting, and is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>To treat children affected by gu poison, who experience hard stomach pain, with a pale yellow complexion and rigid bones, and for whom the illness varies: use two taels of peach tree mistletoe, pound finely, and sieve for powder, to be taken like tea, four to five times a day. Additionally, use half a coin’s worth of musk, finely ground, to be taken on an empty stomach with warm water, which will expel the gu poison; if ineffective, take again.</p>
<p>To treat a child suffering from gu poison with bleeding that threatens death: take the blood of a living red hen&#39;s wing and consume it for immediate effect. Also, there is the use of pounded indigo juice, to be frequently taken half mixed.</p>
<p>To treat nightmares and being unable to wake: blow the powdered liver of a dragon into the nose.</p>
<p>To revive someone suddenly dead with closed eyes: use the juice of chives pounded in front of their face and pour it into their ears. Additionally, to revive someone suddenly dead whose limbs do not retract and have lost their functions: take one sheng of cow dung, warm it, and pour it into their mouth. (Dung here refers to liquefied excrement.)</p>
<p>When someone has died without a pulse and shows no other signs, it is because both yin and yang have been depleted. Use a vine to touch their nose for two hundred breaths; if the cow licks, they will heal. If the cow does not wish to lick, apply salt water to their face, and the cow will then lick.</p>
<p>To treat death from a nightmare with unawareness, it is necessary to be careful with the lighting and avoid anyone moving their hands. Touch the cow gently above to awaken them. If they cannot speak, take the head of a chicken from the east gate, powder it, and take it with wine.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat sudden death: crush leek juice and pour it into the nostrils; for severe cases, pour it into both ears.</p>
<p>The Gè family&#39;s &quot;Zhou Hou Fang&quot; states: When a child dies suddenly and the limbs are not retracting, if there are signs of defecation, burn points one inch below the heart, three inches above the navel, and four inches below the navel, each with a hundred moxibustions. For younger children, adjust according to their age. Also, moxibustion on the area below the nose, known as the ghost&#39;s guest hall, also treats corpse qi. Xu Chunfu&#39;s &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Canon&quot; mentions: if a child suffers from prolonged intermittent fever, use three needles on the Sanfen point, and apply five moxibustions. Sanfen is located three inches from the wrist between the two tendons, corresponding to the heart protector pulse. For children with fright or convulsions, needle the Yinbai point one minute, applying three moxibustions. Yinbai is located on the inner side of the big toe, just below the nail, representing the spleen pulse. Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: the Gè family&#39;s elbow-back moxibustion method involves wrapping a rope around the elbows and wrists of the deceased: left for males, right for females, extending the rope from the back down from the large vertebra. From this point, apply moxibustion along the sides. This method, applying three moxibustions at each of the three points, can revive. If not reviving, roll the hand and apply moxibustion below the head according to age. Additionally, three moxibustions in the nose and ten moxibustions in the area beneath the jaw called Chengjiang are highly effective. Furthermore, apply seven moxibustions at the base of the toenails of both big toes for efficacy. This is the method of Hua Tuo, which some say requires thirty-seven moxibustions. Also, a hundred moxibustions at the navel.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zhu You (Blessing and Healing)</strong></p>
<p>Sun Simiao in &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; says: For treating a child who has been afflicted by a guest spirit and is vomiting uncontrollably, apply moxibustion to the palms, the main pulse points, the hidden white point, and the three yin intersections, each using three strong applications. You can use powdered pills made like fermented beans. Also use saliva, spitting while reciting a spell. The incantation is: &quot;Father of the family, Mother of the family, the child is suffering; this guest spirit began with me. Even though Bian Que is good, he is not as good as the effective use of saliva.&quot; After reciting the spell, discard the pill in the middle of the road. [According to &quot;Standards for Clear Treatment,&quot; the powder is made into pills like fermented beans; apply saliva and massage the child’s hands, feet, heart, and abdomen, while using the spell for the guest spirit, which can be used for both the host and guest.]</p>
<p>Another method: Take a knife and lay it horizontally over the stove, remove the child’s clothes, and uncover the abdomen. Hold the knife towards the child while reciting an incantation, spit, and then point the knife towards the heart and abdomen, saying: &quot;Shining sun, rising in the east, turning from shadow to light. Lord Ge, Lord Ge, I do not know which lord; the child comes but does not look, leaves without care, exceeding the affliction of a living person. Dust on the beam is the spirit&#39;s trace; earth beneath the door is where the ghost travels. Great knife and horn against the stove spirit, two sevens of spit, guest spirit relieve the child’s fright.&quot; Spit again. Repeat this for twice seven times, using the knife to direct it and reciting the spell three times to complete, take these pills, break them open to check for hair, and discard them in the middle of the road; the guest spirit will then be healed.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Wan family&#39;s &quot;Pediatric Insights&quot; states: A child, half a year old, suddenly appeared gloomy and unhappy, was in a deep sleep, and would not nurse. I said: The child&#39;s complexion shows no illness. If we speculate that it is an external attack of wind or cold, there are no signs of such an attack; if we suspect internal damage from food or milk, there is no evidence of internal injury either. This child seems to have no worries; if there were worries, it would harm the spleen, which is why he is in deep sleep and not nursing. His parents realized: There is a little boy who has been accompanying him; I sent him away three days ago. The wet nurse also said: Since that little boy left, he has not been happy and has not eaten. The father urgently ordered him to be called back. Upon seeing the boy, the child smiled. The father said: Without the wise techniques of the elder, this would not be understood.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>
