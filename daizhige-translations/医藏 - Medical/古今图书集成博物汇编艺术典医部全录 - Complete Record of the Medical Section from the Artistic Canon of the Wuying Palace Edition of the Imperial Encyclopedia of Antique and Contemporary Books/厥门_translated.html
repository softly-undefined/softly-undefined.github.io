<p><strong>Jue Men (Gate of Observance)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi Suwen (Huangdi&#39;s Simple Questions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Regulation of the Four Seasons and the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>In winter, during the three months, this is the time of closing and storing. The water freezes and the earth cracks; there should be no disruption to the Yang (positive energy). Sleep early and rise late, and wait for sunlight, allowing your will to be quiet and concealed, as if having private intentions or already possessing something. Avoid cold and seek warmth, preserving the skin from leakage, ensuring the energy does not escape suddenly. This is the proper response to winter energy, the way of nourishment and storage. To go against this will injure the kidneys, leading to atrophy and coldness in spring, making it hard for those who give life (i.e., caregivers) to have vitality. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: All things are collected and closed during winter; the Yang energy is stored, so do not disturb it by leaking out. Sleep early and rise late, following the nurturing and storing energy, and be sure to wait for sunlight to avoid cold evils. Keep your thoughts inward, without external distractions. If there are private intentions or if one feels content, the spirit and energy are kept within. Avoid cold and seek warmth to nurture the Yang; do not allow the skin&#39;s warmth to be leaked and its root energy to be suddenly taken away. All these are in accordance with winter energy and represent the way to nurture and store energy. To go against winter’s storing energy will injure the kidneys, leading to illness such as atrophy in spring and difficulties for caregivers.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Discussion on Shen</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes cold and heat to lead to Shen? Qi Bo replied: When Yang qi declines below, it results in cold Shen; when Yin qi declines below, it results in heat Shen. </p>
<p>(Note: When qi is reversed, it causes confusion, leading to dizziness or fainting, and one may suddenly lose awareness of others. This condition is termed Shen, which differs from a stroke. There are conditions of both cold and heat, and both Yin and Yang energy are involved. Both Yin and Yang qi rise from below; hence, the causes of cold and heat Shen arise from the decline of these energies below.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The heat of heat Shen certainly arises from below the feet, why is that? Qi Bo replied: Yang qi rises from the tips of the toes, while the Yin vessels gather below the feet and converge at the soles. Therefore, when Yang qi prevails, it generates heat below the feet.</p>
<p>(Note: When Yang qi dominates, Yin qi becomes deficient and Yang takes precedence, thus heat Shen originates from below the feet.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The cold of cold Shen certainly must ascend from the toes to the knees, why is that? Qi Bo replied: Yin qi rises from within the toes, gathers beneath the knees, and converges above the knees; hence, when Yin qi prevails, it results in cold rising from the toes to the knees. This cold is not from the outside, but entirely from within.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The note explains that the blood and energy of the Three Yin originate at the ends of the inner sides of the five fingers and gather below the knees, where the three Yin intersect above the ankles; when accumulated above the knees, the Three Yin meridians rise along the inner thigh. Thus, the cold comes not from the outside but rather from within.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What causes cold and convulsions?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The front Yin is where the Zong muscles converge, a meeting of the Tai Yin and Yang Ming. In spring and summer, Yang energy is abundant while Yin energy is sparse; in autumn and winter, Yin energy is strong while Yang energy declines. If a person is robust yet suffers from a loss during autumn and winter, their lower energy contends with the upper, failing to recover. Vital essence overflows downward, and evils rise with it. When the energy originates within, Yang energy weakens, failing to nourish the channels of the meridians. With diminishing Yang energy and only Yin remaining, the hands and feet become cold.&quot;</p>
<p>The note further elaborates that the root of the Zong muscles arises from within the womb, connecting inwardly to the kidneys. The dual energies of Yin and Yang are generated in the stomach and transmitted to the Tai Yin, stored in the kidneys. The gathering of Tai Yin and Yang Ming in the Zong muscles occurs between the middle and lower Jiao, combining in the region of the front Yin. During autumn and winter, when Yang energy is conserved and Yin energy is prominent, this condition leads to cold convulsions; the robust physical nature leads one to overexert, causing lower energy to contend with upper energy, thus failing to be contained below. When Yang energy escapes upward, the essence of the Yin organs likewise overflows downward.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Evil qi refers to the cold and dampness associated with the yin organs. The yang qi resides in the yin organs, and when the essence of yang emerges, the yin coldness rises along with it. Therefore, the yang produced in the middle burner also diminishes, unable to nourish the channels and collaterals. The qi in the upper and lower parts cannot mutually support one another, causing the yang qi to gradually deplete while the yin qi remains alone, hence the hands and feet become cold.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What about heat stroke, how does that occur?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When alcohol enters the stomach, the collaterals become full while the main channels are empty. The spleen is responsible for transporting the fluids of the stomach. When yin qi is deficient, yang qi intrudes; when yang qi intrudes, the stomach becomes unharmonious. If the stomach is unharmonious, the essence and qi are depleted; if the essence and qi are depleted, it cannot nourish the four limbs. This person must frequently get drunk, especially after indulging, as the qi accumulates in the spleen and cannot disperse. The qi of the alcohol mingles with the qi of the grains, creating excessive internal heat, which spreads throughout the body, leading to internal heat and red urine. The abundant alcohol qi is fierce, which gradually diminishes the kidney qi, allowing the yang qi to dominate, hence the hands and feet become hot.</p>
<p>Note: Wei qi is the vigorous qi of water and grains. Alcohol is also a vigorous and hot liquid derived from water and grains, therefore it follows the wei qi to surface on the skin and fills the collaterals, rather than moving through the channels alongside the spleen qi, resulting in full collaterals and empty channels. If it does not pass through the spleen qi to circulate in the channels, then yin qi is deficient.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>When the fierce heat rises from outside to within, the Yang energy enters. The Yangming is the organ of dryness and heat, which derives its essence from the Yin of the Taiyin. When the Yin energy is deficient and Yang heat enters, the stomach energy becomes unbalanced, leading to a depletion of the vital essences that cannot nourish the limbs. If one drinks alcohol excessively, the alcohol energy accumulates in the spleen; if one indulges excessively, the food energy remains trapped in the stomach, and the spleen cannot metabolize its essences. As the food energy accumulates and cannot disperse, the alcohol energy and food energy invade each other, resulting in excessive internal heat. The heat from the central region spreads to the surroundings, causing heat to pervade the body. If the food and drink entering the stomach cannot circulate the vital essences downward to the bladder, this results in internal heat and red urine. The kidneys, as the water organs, receive and store the essences of food and water. When the alcohol heat is strong and vigorous, the vital essences of the kidneys diminish daily, the Yin energy dwindles below, and the Yang energy prevails within, causing the hands and feet to become hot.</p>
<p>The Emperor then asked: Why do some experience abdominal fullness, some suddenly become unaware of their surroundings, and some may take half a day or even a whole day to regain awareness? Qibo replied: When Yin energy is strong above, the lower part becomes deficient, leading to abdominal fullness. When Yang energy is strong above, it causes the lower energy to press upwards, creating a reversal of evil energies. This reversal disrupts the Yang energy, and when the Yang energy is disordered, it results in a loss of awareness.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: When the yang is obstructed from knowing the person, there may suddenly arise confusion or fainting. The qi of half a day refers to the half cycle of qi circulation, while the qi of a whole day refers to the complete cycle of qi. When the yin qi is strong above, it indicates damage to the yang qi in the middle burner, with the yin qi alone prevailing above. When the yin is dominant above, the yang qi of the lower burner is also deficient, leading to yang deficiency below, which causes abdominal distension. The lower qi refers to the primordial yang of the lower burner, and the evil qi is the cold water of the kidneys. When the yang qi is strong above, it signifies that the yin qi is deficient and the yang qi prevails alone. When the yang is strong above, the lower qi rises up; if the lower qi ascends, cold evil follows and rises against it, disrupting the yang qi above and causing sudden confusion. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. I wish to hear about the conditions of the six meridians and the diseases they represent. Qibo replied: If there is blockage in the Greater Yang, the head becomes swollen and heavy, and the feet cannot move, leading to fainting or collapsing. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the yang of the feet is reversed upwards, it causes swelling in the head and head pain; if it reverses downwards, then the feet cannot move, both being diseases of the Greater Yang. When the spirit and qi become confused, it leads to dizziness and fainting, as the Greater Yang is the master of all yang energies. </p>
<p>If the yangming is blocked, it results in manic agitation, a desire to run and shout, abdominal fullness that prevents lying down, a red and hot face, and delusions of seeing and speaking falsely.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Mania, agitation, shouting, and delusional speech and sight are diseases of the yangming meridian.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Due to the reversal of qi, the abdomen is bloated, and if the stomach is not harmonious, one cannot sleep. The Yangming channel is the channel of dryness and heat; its qi emerges at the face, hence the face is red and hot. If the Shaoyang channel is in a state of reversal, there will be sudden deafness, swelling and heat in the cheeks, pain in the flanks, and the legs will be unable to move. </p>
<p>In the case of the Taiyin channel&#39;s reversal, there is abdominal fullness and swelling, difficulty with bowel movements, lack of appetite, and if one eats, there will be vomiting, preventing sleep. This is because, when food and drink enter the stomach, the spleen is responsible for transformation and transportation; if qi is reversed in the spleen, there will be difficulty with bowel movements. If the spleen does not transport and regulate, then the stomach will also not be harmonious, resulting in vomiting and inability to sleep.</p>
<p>In the event of the Shaoyin channel&#39;s reversal, there may be dry mouth, red urine, abdominal fullness, and heart pain. This occurs because the reversal of the meridian prevents the yin fluids from ascending, leading to dry mouth and heart pain. The lung channel cannot regulate smoothly downward, hence the red urine. The interaction of water and fire, yin and yang qi does not harmonize, resulting in abdominal fullness.</p>
<p>For the Jueyin channel&#39;s reversal, there will be swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, difficulty with urination, a tendency to sleep while bending the knees, swelling of the yin areas, and internal heat in the legs. The reversal causes swelling and pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal bloating, with difficulty in urination and swelling in the yin areas.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The liver governs the tendons, and the knee is where the tendons converge. When the meridians experience counterflow, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, thus leading to a tendency to lie down with the knees bent. The Jueyin wood and fire govern qi, causing counterflow and resulting in swelling and heat in the knee.</p>
<p>When there is excess, it should be drained; when there is deficiency, it should be replenished. When there is neither excess nor deficiency, it should be adjusted according to the meridian.</p>
<p>Note: Since the counterflow occurs in the meridians, treatment should follow the meridian. If the qi in the meridian is excessive, use needles to drain and disperse it. If the qi is deficient, use needles to tonify it. When there is neither excess nor deficiency, harmonizing movements of the primary meridian is termed &#39;meridian needling.&#39;</p>
<p>In the case of Taiyin counterflow, when the knee is cramping sharply, and there is pain in the heart radiating to the abdomen, it treats the main disease. </p>
<p>Note: The qi of the Central Plains governs the nourishment of surrounding areas. When the Foot Taiyin qi is in counterflow, it causes cramping in the knee. The spleen qi is counterflowing and cannot transport its essence, which leads to heart qi being deficient and causing pain radiating to the abdomen. This is a disease originating from the spleen, so it is necessary to treat the spleen qi directly.</p>
<p>In the case of Shaoyin counterflow, with fullness and vomiting, causing clear diarrhea, it treats the main disease.</p>
<p>Note: The qi of Shaoyin combines with Yangming from above to govern the transformation of food and fluids. The counterflow of Shaoyin qi leads to excessive fullness in the middle burner, resulting in vomiting. When the qi of water and fire does not transform properly, it results in clear, cold diarrhea.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The cold and reverse flow of the liver causes pain in the waist, fullness in the front, delirium, and treats the principal diseases. Note: &quot;Contraction&quot; is governed by the liver, the waist is the exterior of the liver, &quot;fullness&quot; means that food and qi cannot disperse the essence in the liver, and &quot;front closure&quot; indicates the liver governs smooth flow. The liver governs speech; delirium occurs when liver qi is stagnant.</p>
<p>When all three yin are reversed, movement in the front and back ceases, causing coldness in the hands and feet, leading to death in three days. Note: &quot;All three yin are reversed&quot; indicates a separation of yin and yang. When there is no movement in the front and back, the yin pertains to the lower body. Since all yang energy is born from yin, if all three yin are reversed, the life force is extinguished, resulting in cold hands and feet and death in three days.</p>
<p>The taiyang reverse flow causes stiffness, collapse, vomiting blood, and nosebleeds, treating the principal diseases. Note: The reverse flow of taiyang energy causes stiffness and collapse. When yang energy rises excessively, it causes vomiting of blood, and when yang heat is in the upper body, it causes nosebleeds.</p>
<p>The shaoyang reverse flow leads to dysfunction in the joints. When the joints are dysfunctional, the waist cannot move, and the neck cannot turn. Note: Shaoyang governs the joints; therefore, if shaoyang energy is in reverse, the joints are affected. The neck and nape signify the convergence of the three yang, and the waist and spine are significant joints in the body; thus, if the joints are dysfunctional, the waist cannot turn, and the neck cannot turn.</p>
<p>If there is an abscess in the intestines, it cannot be treated; death will occur if there is shock.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>【Note: The Lesser Yang fire governs Qi; when fire reverses internally, it leads to intestinal abscesses. Intestinal abscesses that cannot be treated indicate that the disease is within the Qi level and the abscess is internal, beyond the possibility of needling. If there is a shock, the toxic Qi invades the organs, thus leading to death.】 The Greater Yang presents with counterflow Qi, wheezing, cough, body heat, and tendency to bleed from the nose and vomit blood. 【Note: When Greater Yang Qi is counterflowing, it causes wheezing; when reversing, it leads to coughing. Greater Yang governs the muscles, so when it is counterflowing, the body feels warm. Greater Yang is essentially a fiercely hot Qi; when Qi reverses, it forces blood to move erratically, thus causing vomiting of blood.】 The Hand Taiyin exhibits counterflow with fullness and cough, prone to spitting up foam, leading to treatment of the main disease. 【Note: The Hand Taiyin lung governs Qi; when it reverses, it leads to fullness and cough; not able to freely distribute body fluids, it leads to spitting up foam. This refers to diseases originating from the lung, thus treating the lung Qi of the main illness.】 The Hand Shenyin presents with counterflow leading to heart pain radiating to the throat, body heat, and death that cannot be treated.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The hands represent the qi of the heart&#39;s pericardium and the heart itself. The pericardium acts as the sovereign fire, and when the two fires oppose each other, they will consume themselves, leading to an incurable death.</p>
<p>When there is a reversal in the hand&#39;s solar yang, it results in deafness, tears, inability to turn the neck, and the waist cannot bend up or down. These conditions are linked to the illness.</p>
<p>If an illness arises from the hand&#39;s solar yang, it causes deafness. The small intestine governs fluids; if it reverses, it causes tears that fail to nourish the meridians, hence the neck cannot be turned, and the waist cannot bend. The waist and neck are significant junctions of the meridian system.</p>
<p>When there is a reversal in the hand&#39;s yangming and shaoyang, it results in throat phlegm, swelling, and paralysis of the throat, indicating the illness.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s yangming corresponds to the lungs, while the hand&#39;s shaoyang relates to the pericardium and the sanjiao. The yangming governs the throat, and the lungs govern the voice; when the fire of the sanjiao is also in opposition, it causes throat phlegm and swelling. The yangming is a dry and hot channel, and the sanjiao is associated with the fire of thunder; when both heat and fire are in opposition, it leads to paralysis.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The Emperor said: If a person has a headache that persists for several years, how can this be explained? What is the name of this illness? Qi Bo replied: It is likely due to an exposure to extreme cold that has penetrated to the marrow. The marrow is governed by the brain. When the brain is affected, it causes headaches and also tooth pain; this illness is called &quot;Jue Ni.&quot; The Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
<p>Section on Major Anomalies</p>
<p>The two Yin conditions urgently cause seizures. The two Yin refers to the Lesser Yin. A seizure is characterized by fainting, collapsing, and being unaware of one’s surroundings. This is because the watery Qi is surging upon the heart, leading to an urgent pulse in the two Yin channels. When the pulse feels like panting, it is called &quot;Bao Jue.&quot; Bao Jue refers to one being unable to communicate with others during a fainting spell. This urgent and slippery pulse indicates phlegm and water obstructing, hence it feels urgent and slippery, referred to as Bao Jue. </p>
<p>Section on Pulse Analysis</p>
<p>The condition referred to as &quot;entering the center&quot; and becoming mute indicates that the Yang has become abundant and then declined, resulting in muteness. If the inner energy is depleted and leads to Jue, this indicates kidney deficiency. If the Lesser Yin does not arrive, it indicates Jue. &quot;Entering the center and becoming mute&quot; means the Yang has become abundant and then declined, resulting in a deficiency of the vital energy, leading to muteness. When Yang is abundant externally but its stored energy is depleted, it results in kidney deficiency. If Yang receives energy from the limbs but then declines, the extremities do not retract, resulting in lethargy. If the kidney energy is insufficient, it leads to muteness, preventing the Qi of the Lesser Yin from arriving, causing coldness in the hands and feet.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>On Regulating Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>When there is excess ambition, it leads to abdominal distension and diarrhea; when there is insufficiency, it results in cold extremities. </p>
<p><em>[Note: The kidneys are the gate of the stomach; if they are not functioning properly, water accumulates and causes abdominal distension and diarrhea. The kidneys are the origin of vital energy, thus insufficiency leads to coldness and counterflow.]</em> </p>
<p>The collateral vessels and sun vessels both connect to the meridians; when blood and qi are combined, it results in fullness. When blood and qi ascend together, it leads to great reversal, causing sudden death. If qi reverses back, there is life; if it does not reverse, there is death. </p>
<p><em>[Note: The blood and qi of the collateral vessels and sun vessels both connect to the meridians, thus blood and qi together are substantial.

<p><strong>On Vital Energy Connecting to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Yang energy, when overworked, expands and depletes, leading to accumulation in summer, resulting in heat exhaustion. </p>
<p><em>[Note: Overwork damages yang energy; in summer, yang energy rises exteriorly, thus increasing deficiency and causing heat exhaustion.]</em> </p>
<p>Great anger causes the physical energy to be severed and blood to accumulate above, leading to lightheadedness. </p>

<h3>Discussion on Yin and Yang</h3>
<p>The Three Yangs result in illness manifesting as cold and heat, leading to boils and swellings, as well as atrophy and numbness. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Three Yangs refer to the Taiyang, which governs the exterior. When an evil force penetrates, it starts at the skin and hair, clashing with the righteous qi, resulting in illnesses characterized by cold and heat. Taiyang governs opening; if illness prevents this, the evil qi obstructs the flesh, leading to boils and swellings. Taiyang is the master of all Yang qi and governs the tendons; if the tendons are harmed, it results in atrophy; if the qi is harmed, it leads to numbness.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Pulse and Its Subtleties</h3>
<p>Numbness leads to vertigo.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Numbness is the reversal of qi upwards. When qi solely reverses upwards, it transforms into a condition of the head.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Evaluation of Deficiency and Excess</h3>
<p>Jaundice, acute pain, epilepsy, and convulsive states are born from prolonged reversals.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Jaundice is due to damp heat accumulating internally, with the resulting discoloration appearing externally. Acute pain arises from an imbalance of qi within the five organs, resulting in sudden pain. Vertigo and convulsions are due to excess or deficiency of Yin and Yang manifesting as illness. All of these arise from prolonged disharmony of the Yin-Yang and the Five Elements.</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Yangming Pulse</h3>
<p>In Yangming deficiency, there is wheezing and lamentation; lamentation indicates aversion to people.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The Emperor asked: When there is a disease causing fever and sweating, yet the feeling of fullness and restlessness does not resolve with sweating, what is this illness? Qi Bo replied: Sweating and fever indicate wind, but when sweating does not relieve the feeling of fullness and restlessness, it is due to obstruction (jue). This illness is called wind obstruction.</p>
<p>The note explains: Wind is a yang pathogen that opens the skin and causes fluids to leak out; when wind-heat remains, it leads to fever. If wind-heat does not dispel, it can harm the kidney energy and cause it to reverse upward. When it reverses upwards, it induces heart restlessness; when it affects the spleen, it causes a feeling of fullness. The sickness is named wind obstruction because it arises from the wind pathogen causing the kidney energy to reverse.</p>
<p>The Emperor requested to hear more. Qi Bo continued: The great yang governs energy, so it is the first to receive pathogens. The lesser yin is its internal counterpart. If heat is present, it follows that the energy will become obstructed. The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: Treat both the exterior and interior by needling, and administer medicinal soup.</p>
<p>The note elaborates: The energy of the greater yang governs the exterior, while wind is a yang pathogen that injures human yang energy; the clash of two yangs results in heat illness. The lesser yin and greater yang correspond internally and externally; when yang heat is on the surface, the yin energy follows, resulting in obstruction. Needle the exterior to dispel the yang pathogen of wind-heat, and needle the interior to address the reversed energy of the lesser yin; give medicinal soup to assist with the fluid and sweat.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Needling</strong></p>
<p>When the evil influences are at the networks of the Foot Shaoyin, Taiyin, and Foot Yangming, all five networks converge at the ear. If these five networks are exhausted, all the arteries in the body begin to move, yet the body remains unaware, resembling a corpse, sometimes referred to as corpse syndrome. If one has cut the hair at the left ear by an inch and burns it, then drinks a cup of fine wine. If one cannot drink, pour it down their throat immediately. </p>
<p>[Note: All meridians originate in the Foot Shaoyin kidneys, are produced in the Foot Yangming stomach, conveyed through the Foot Taiyin spleen, governed by the Hand Shaoyin heart, and directed to the Hand Taiyin lungs; thus, the energy of the five meridians converges at the ear. The network at the left ear is linked to the liver, which rules blood and resides on the left, its energy rising to the crown. When all five networks are exhausted, the nourishment and defense do not circulate, causing the body’s arteries to tremble yet remain unaware, termed corpse syndrome. The reason one lives and moves is through the circulation of energy and blood; when blood and energy do not flow, the form becomes like a corpse. Needle the great toe at the hidden white point of the Foot Taiyin, needle the heart at the springing point of the Foot Shaoyin; needle the middle finger at the mouth of the Foot Yangming; needle the great finger at the lesser merchant point of the Hand Taiyin; needle the heart&#39;s master point of the Hand Shaoyin. This will clear the blood and energy, and the syndrome will cease. If it does not cease, use a bamboo tube to blow at both ears to clear the ancestral vessels, cut the hair at the left ear to clear the nourishing blood, and drink fine wine to clear the defensive energy.]<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Changes of Qi</strong></p>
<p>In years when water is excessive, cold qi flows, disturbing the heart fire and causing the people to suffer from yin collapse. </p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Five Constants</strong></p>
<p>When metal is insufficient, it is termed as following the changes. The period of transformation is called &quot;breaking and receiving.&quot; Its qi rises, its use is hasty and sharp, and its movement is like a clang that confuses and collapses. </p>
<p>When the lesser yang is in control of heaven, there is qi reversal. </p>
<p>The earth is in the center; if the diaphragm is not open, then there is a reversal of qi between above and below. When the greater yin is in control of heaven, the damp qi descends, and the kidney qi rises, causing a reversal of qi. </p>
<p>If the yang qi does not rise, then the hands and feet will experience qi reversal.</p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Correct Principles of the Six Origins</strong></p>
<p>When water is stagnant, the people tend to experience qi reversal. </p>
<p>The reversal of qi arises from the storage of yang qi below, which causes a blockage in the middle qi. </p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Most True Essentials</strong></p>
<p>When the yang brightness is at the spring, if it dominates excessively, there will be cold collapse in the intestines, surging upward to the chest, leading to severe breathlessness and an inability to stand for long. </p>
<p>The cold collapse in the intestines surges up to the chest, causing breathlessness, as the cold qi ascends against the yang brightness of the large intestine, reaching the lungs in the chest. When the sun prevails, if cold collapse enters the stomach, it leads to internal heart pain.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The one who reverses and enters the stomach, water insults the earth. The stomach channels connect upwards to the heart, hence the heartache. The return of the sun causes the counterflow of qi to rise.</p>
<p>This refers to the stagnant cold qi rising, which resembles the qi from a year and a half prior. All counterflows downward belong to the lower regions. When the yang qi above reverses, it causes counter-cold. The lesser yin is in the spring, ruling that when victorious, the counter qi rises causing heart pain.</p>
<p>The ascending counter qi is governed by cold water, which ascends above the ruler fire in spring.</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion on abundance and decline, the thunder god asked how to distinguish the amount of qi and which is contrary and which is following. The Yellow Emperor replied: yang moves from the left, yin from the right. The elderly move from above, the young from below. Thus, spring and summer returning to yang signifies life, while returning to autumn and winter signifies death. Conversely, returning to autumn and winter can signify life, hence the excessive qi that is contrary is all a counterflow. </p>
<p>The question arose: Is an excess considered a counterflow? The answer was: If rising without descending, then cold counterflow reaches the knees, leading to death in the young during autumn and winter while the elderly may live. When qi rises without descending, headaches occur and the crown of the head experiences illness. Seeking yang yields nothing, while seeking yin is unclear; the five regions are isolated without signs, akin to being in a wilderness or lying in an empty chamber, endlessly incomplete within the day. Therefore, the lesser qi’s counterflow leads to delusive dreams, reaching the ultimate state of confusion.</p>
<p>The comment on yang moving from the left indicates that the qi of spring and summer flows from the left to the right, and the yin from the right indicates that the qi of autumn and winter flows from the right to the left.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The energy of the elderly descends from above, like the autumn atmosphere gradually declining downwards; the energy of the young ascends from below, like the spring atmosphere flourishing upwards. Therefore, the energies of spring and summer return to the Yang, moving from left to right, which follows the natural order, hence this is the vitality; while the energies of autumn and winter return to the Yin, moving from right to left, which defies the order, thus this is the state of decline. Conversely, the autumn and winter energies returning to the Yin moving from right to left signify life, while returning to spring and summer moving from left to right signifies disorder. Thus, regardless of the amount of energy, anything contrary signifies stagnation. </p>
<p>One speaks of a single Yin energy. If it rises and does not descend, and the cold stagnation reaches the knees, this is the ascending of Yin energy according to the dictates of autumn and winter. Therefore, the elderly align with the natural order, while the young are contrary. The energy discussed here pertains to a single Yang energy. If it rises and does not descend, and headaches manifest, this represents Yang energy ascending directly to the crown. </p>
<p>If one is unaware of the way the heavens, earth, and humanity combine, seeking Yang without attaining the energy, or seeking Yin without discerning its subtleties, then one becomes cut off and lacks evidence. A deficiency in energy leads to the reversed ascension of energy.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Subtle Essence</strong></p>
<p>When the energies converge, the eyes are unable to see. In a person, the yang energy gathers above, and the yin energy gathers below. When yang gathers above, fire shines alone; when yin gathers below, the feet become cold, and cold feet lead to swelling. Water cannot withstand five fires, hence the eyes become blind. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The essence of the kidneys does not ascend and connect with the eyes, hence there is no vision. &quot;Convergence&quot; refers to the gathering of various yang energies above and various yin energies below. The heart is the sun among the yang, specializing in the five organs&#39; essence; thus, when yang gathers above without the harmonization of yin energy, fire shines alone above. The kidneys are the organ of water, storing the essence of the five organs, and the yin veins gather at the feet and concentrate at the soles. When yin gathers below without the harmonization of yang energy, the feet become cold, leading to cold organs and fullness diseases. The term &quot;water&quot; refers to the water of the sun, while &quot;five fires&quot; refers to the yang energies of the five organs. Therefore, when yin and yang are reversed, the eyes become blind. &quot;Blind&quot; refers to the two bright eyes of the sun, aligned with the heavens&#39; sun and moon.]</strong><a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Classic Text on the Spirit Pivot:</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Manifestations of Pathogenic Qi in the Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the heart pulse is weak and sluggish, it results in cessation of the limbs.<br><em>Note:</em> &quot;Cessation&quot; refers to the four limbs. The heart is the solar energy among the Yang organs, hence the hands and feet become cold. </p>
<p>When the kidney pulse is weak and rapid, it results in fainting or sudden anxiety.<br><em>Note:</em> The kidneys are the source of vital energy; when the upright qi is deficient and cold, it leads to fainting. The deficiency of qi reacting inversely causes sudden anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>On the Original Spirit</strong></p>
<p>When kidney qi is deficient, it leads to cessation.<br><em>Note:</em> The kidneys are the source of vital energy, therefore deficiency leads to cessation.</p>
<p><strong>On the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of the Lung&#39;s Hand Taiyin is characterized by severe movement leading to dizziness when the two hands cross, which indicates limb cessation. This pulse governs lung-related illnesses, causing pain and cessation in the inner and anterior areas of the upper arm.<br><em>Note:</em> Dizziness due to crossing the hands is caused by kidney qi rebounding. The pain and cessation in the upper arm represents the affected section of the meridian.</p>
<p>The pulse of the Heart&#39;s Hand Shaoyin, when in motion, causes dryness in the throat, heart pain, thirst, and the desire to drink, which indicates limb cessation; this pulse governs heart-related illnesses, resulting in pain and cessation in the inner and posterior areas of the upper arm.<br><em>Note:</em> The upper arm is the section governed by the central pulse.</p>
<p>The pulse of the Bladder&#39;s Foot Taiyang, when in movement, leads to headaches, bulging eyes, a stiff neck, back pain, waist discomfort, difficulty bending the hip, tightness in the knee, and sensation of rupture in the ankle, indicating ankle cessation.<br><em>Note:</em> This illness pertains to the energy of the Taiyang.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The pulse of the Kidney&#39;s Lesser Yin, when in motion, results in the illness of hunger with no desire for food, and the face appears like lacquered wood. When coughing and expectorating, there is blood; wheezing and gasping occur, sitting but wanting to rise, eyes cannot see anything, and the heart feels suspended as if in hunger. If the qi is insufficient, there is great fear; the heart feels restless as if one is about to be captured, which is termed bone deficiency. This indicates diseases originating from the Kidney, such as weakness and deficiency.</p>
<p>(Note: Above the Lesser Yin, the Ruler Fire governs. When the Lesser Yin is in motion, the qi of up and down does not communicate, hence the lack of desire for food and the heart feeling suspended as if in hunger. If qi is insufficient below, there will be great fear; if insufficient above, the heart feels restless as if one is about to be captured. The Lesser Yin belongs to the Kidney, which is linked above to the Lung, and the Kidney is the source of vital qi. When the face appears like lacquered wood, it indicates that the qi of the Lesser Yin does not rise. Coughing with blood and wheezing indicates that the vital qi of the Lesser Yin does not ascend and is instead rebellious in the Lung.)<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>To sit and desire to rise is a sign of agitation, indicating that the energy of the Lesser Yin is stagnant below and wishes to ascend. The essence of the bones is related to vision; if the eyes see nothing, it is because the essence does not rise. This represents the vital energy of the Lesser Yin kidneys that is obstructed below, resulting in various ailments, hence it is termed bone obstruction.</p>
<p>The gallbladder&#39;s channel, associated with the Greater Yang, manifests as bitterness in the mouth when it is agitated, along with sighing, pain in the chest and flanks, an inability to turn over, and in severe cases, a fine dust appears on the face, while the body lacks moisture, and there is external heat in the feet, which is termed Yang obstruction.</p>
<p>Note: When agitated, it causes bitterness in the mouth, frequent sighing, chest and flank pain, and an inability to turn over, indicating that the energy of the Greater Yang does not rise. The Greater Yang governs the initial energy of life, thus the gallbladder energy rises, and the energies of the eleven organs also ascend. When the energy of the Greater Yang moves abnormally, it obstructs and does not ascend, leading to symptoms such as fine dust on the face and a lack of moisture in the body. The fire energy of the Greater Yang governs the breath; when the feet are hot, it indicates fire is obstructed below, resulting from the reverse of Yang energy.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Five Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Clear qi resides in yin, while turbid qi is in yang. Nourishing qi flows smoothly through the channels, while defending qi moves against the current. When clear and turbid qi interfere, it causes chaos in the chest, which is known as great confusion. Therefore, when qi is in disorder in the limbs, it results in the four extremities being cold; when it is chaotic in the head, it leads to reversed flow, causing heaviness and dizziness in the head.</p>
<p><strong>Reversal and Order of Weight</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Why does the lesser yin pulse flow downward alone? Qi Bo replied: The chong vessel is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels; all are nourished by it. The upper part emerges from the temples, permeates the yang, and irrigates the essence; the lower part enters the great network of the lesser yin, emerging from the qi street, flowing along the inner thigh into the knee, lying within the skin of the calf, and descending to the back of the inner ankle. The lower section connects with the lesser yin channel and penetrates the three yin; the front part flows within the foot, descending along the ankle, entering between the big toe, nourishing the network and warming the muscles. Thus, when the network is obstructed, the ankle remains immobile; if it does not move, it results in cold extremities, which leads to disorder.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>If one is timid and frail, then the pathways of water will not be effective, and the energy will dissipate. The energy of the five organs and six bowels is all derived from the Chong channel. Those that rise from the head diffuse through the Yang and flow into the Yin; those that descend are connected to the Lesser Yin&#39;s major channel, exiting at the Qi Street. The blood and energy of the five organs and six bowels all pass through the Chong channel and permeate between the skin and meridians, responding to water and following Qi to operate on the surface. The Lesser Yin governs the primal water and fire, which are essence and energy. The Chong channel and the meridian of Lesser Yin permeate the three Yin channels, circulating through the ankles and entering between the big toes, radiating through the collaterals to warm the muscles. This essence and energy of the Lesser Yin flows out and operates beyond the channels and skin. Therefore, if the collaterals are obstructed, the energy of the Lesser Yin cannot circulate through the ankle, causing the ankle to become immobile. When it is immobile, it indicates that the energy of the Lesser Yin is stagnant within, leading to coldness.</p>
<p>The Thunder Lord said: Young ones, those who hear the wind are at the beginning of myriad illnesses; reversal indicates the onset of cold dampness. How does one differentiate? The Yellow Emperor replied: The regular phenomenon is that at the gate of the palace, thin moisture produces wind, turbid energy causes obstruction in the body, and on the ground it leads to reversal; these are the norms, each indicated by its corresponding color concerning the disease. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Ground&quot; refers to the Earth Pavilion. Wind represents the weather, thus regularly appearing at the palace courtyard. Cold dampness indicates the energy of the Earth, hence it is observed in the terrestrial area. Wind is a Yang pathology, hence its color is thin moisture. Cold dampness is a Yin pathology, hence its color is turbid energy.)<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p>

<p><strong>Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>If the illness is accompanied by delirium or nonsensical speech, there should be heat in the body, the pulse should be rapid and large; however, if the hands and feet are cold and the pulse is deep, thin, and weak, it indicates death.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials from the Golden Chamber</strong> (Han, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>In the section on internal organs, it is stated: A question is posed: When the pulse is deep, large, and slippery, the deepness indicates something real, while the slipperiness indicates Qi. When the real Qi clashes, it causes blood Qi to enter the internal organs, leading to death; if it enters the bowels, recovery occurs. This is known as sudden reversal. What does this mean? The teacher says: The lips and mouth may be blue, and the body cold, indicating entry into the internal organs, leading to death; if the body is warm and there is spontaneous sweating, it indicates entry into the bowels, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In the section on abdominal fullness: If there is abdominal pain with a tight, wiry pulse, the tightness indicates stagnation of defensive Qi, leading to aversion to cold; the wiriness indicates lack of appetite; when evil and correct Qi clash, it results in cold hernia. Cold hernia causes pain around the navel, and if it develops, a white fluid may be discharged, with hands and feet feeling cold; if the pulse is deep and tight, the decoction of Aconitum should be employed.</p>
<p>In the section on water Qi: If the pulse at the wrist is slow and thin, the slowness indicates coldness, while thinness indicates insufficient blood. The pulse at the foot yin position is weak and slow; weakness indicates Qi, slowness indicates cold, and insufficient cold Qi results in hands and feet feeling cold. If hands and feet are cold, the nourishing and guarding Qi is disturbed, leading to abdominal fullness and sounds in the sides that chase each other. When Qi reaches the bladder, both the nourishing and guarding Qi are exhausted.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>When the Yang energy is blocked, the body becomes cold; when the Yin energy is blocked, there is pain in the bones. When Yang energy flows first, there is aversion to cold; when Yin energy flows first, there is numbness and paralysis. When Yin and Yang complement each other, their energies circulate. When the vital energy changes, it disperses. If it is full, energy is lost; if it is deficient, there is incontinence, termed the energy division. </p>
<p>In the Vomiting chapter: for dry vomiting and retching, or when hands and feet are cold, the tangerine peel decoction is the main treatment. </p>
<p>In the Diarrhea chapter: when the Qi of the six bowels is blocked externally, the hands and feet become cold, the upper body qi is tight, and the feet shrink; when the Qi of the five organs is blocked internally, diarrhea occurs without restraint, and in severe cases, the hands and feet become numb. </p>
<p>For diarrhea with cold hands and feet and no pulse, if moxibustion is applied and it does not warm, and the pulse does not return, accompanied by slight wheezing, it indicates death. The lesser Yin&#39;s resistance to the Yang is considered proper. </p>
<p>For diarrhea with clear fluids, there must be accompanied sweating and resolution; the patient must exhibit slight syncope, because their face is warm, indicating a deficiency below. </p>
<p>For diarrhea accompanied by a cessation of the pulse, cold hands and feet, if the pulse returns at a later stage and the hands and feet are warm, there is life; if the pulse does not return, it indicates death.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>On Yang Illness</strong></p>
<p>Sudden winds and scorching heat, clouds and objects flying about, morning darkness to evening brightness, hot nights and cold days, responding to cold yet not cold, expecting rain yet no rain, water dried up and soil damaged, years of great drought, grass and trees withering, rivers running dry—this is the Yang illness of heaven and earth. </p>
<p>Violent blockages, sudden shortness of breath, limbs unable to move, the two bowels not functioning, deafness and blindness, dry throat and scorched mouth, sores on the throat and tongue, clear nasal discharge, flushed cheeks and restless heart, dizziness and heavy head, eyes like fire, whole body feeling burned, those who usually cannot suddenly able, those who usually do not want suddenly wanting, climbing high to sing and laugh, shedding clothes and running, speaking wildly and irrationally, unable to distinguish kin from stranger, doing things heedlessly, drinking water without rest, chest bloated, abdomen and sides full and uncomfortable, back ulcers and rotting flesh, restless and collapsing inward, food not entering the stomach, water not passing through the intestines, sudden swelling and fullness, shouting and becoming muddled, losing awareness, pain without a known location—this is the Yang illness in a person. </p>
<p>The pulse of Yang illness, strong when pressed, signifies life; absent signifies death.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>On Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Frost flies, hail runs; dawn and dusk bring haze. Clouds and rain drift, winds and dew are cold. The heat is not hot, while the cold arrives before it is cold. The weather is damp and stagnant, springs arise in fields, mountains crumble and earth splits, soil deteriorates and rivers overflow; the moon is obscured, and the sun dims. This is the manifestation of Yin and its cessation in heaven and earth. </p>
<p>When there is sudden and harsh cold, the body feels tight and constricted; the limbs are clenched, lips turn blue, face becomes dark, eyes are wide while the mouth is shut, the heart and abdomen feel fullness and pain, the head shakes and throbs, the waist and feet are heavy; speech becomes difficult, there is vomiting and diarrhea, there is numbness on both sides, bowel movements are uncontrollable, swallowing brings sourness. There is sorrow and distress; emotions fluctuate erratically — this is the manifestation of Yin and its cessation in a person.</p>
<p>The pulse of Yin and its cessation: if the pulse is weak when lifting the finger and strong when pressing it, life is present; if both lifting and pressing are absent, death occurs. If the whole body is cold and sweat appears on the forehead, that too signifies death. Illness of Yin and its cessation should not be treated for more than three days.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>When yang qi ascends and does not descend, it is called &quot;contrary.&quot; When yin qi descends and does not ascend, it is also called &quot;contrary.&quot; When yang qi descends and does not ascend, it is called &quot;blocked,&quot; and when yin qi ascends and does not descend, it is also called &quot;blocked.&quot; &quot;Contrary and blocked&quot; refers to the inability of yin and yang to correspond with each other. When yang rushes above, it causes burning, leading to jaundice from the spleen and lungs, which manifests as a yellow-red color, arising from the extreme of yang. When yin runs below, it causes freezing, leading to cold extremities from the kidneys and liver, which presents as a green-black color, arising from the extreme of yin. Jaundice refers to yellow jaundice, and cold extremities refer to cold extremities due to the obstruction and non-communication of yin and yang. For yang&#39;s burning, treat with water; for yin&#39;s cold extremities, assist with fire; thus, it is the way of mutual support between yin and yang.</p>
<p>Regarding moxibustion, if one should administer it but does not, it results in cold extremities and reverses the flow.</p>
<p>For illnesses that warrant moxibustion, it opens the yin to connect with yang. Failing to perform moxibustion leads to heavy condensations of cold qi, toxic yin accumulating internally, qi of cold extremities surging upwards, creating separation and obliteration.</p>
<p>Concerning fatal pulses:</p>
<p>For conditions of cold extremities, if the pulse is floating, large, and short, it is fatal.<br>For cold extremities, if one calls but there is no response, and the pulse is absent, it is fatal.<br>For fullness in the cold extremities, if the pulse is long, it is fatal.<br>For cold extremities with sweating, if the pulse is weak and slow, it is fatal.</p>
<p>Pulse Classic by Wang Shuhe:</p>
<p>Regarding pulse methods:</p>
<p>For simultaneous deficiency of liver and gallbladder: if in the right hand at the pulse position both yin and yang are deficient, it indicates deficiency in the foot&#39;s lesser yin and lesser yang channels. The patient suffers from confusion and is unable to recognize people, has hallucinations, feels weak and cannot speak, and is often startled. The governing channel illness presents with a strong spine and cold extremities.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>When entering, it is the yang riding on the yin. The symptoms include a cool body with cold limbs and a bad hot feeling, indicating external yin and internal yang; however, if one feels neither hot nor thirsty, that means both inside and outside are yin. Zhongjing states: if the cold is deep, the heat is also deep; if the cold is mild, the heat is mild too. Mouth sores that are rotten and red come from excessive sweating.</p>
<p><strong>On Yin and Yang, Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Intense yang leads to an intense yin, and an intense yin leads to an intense yang; this is the transformation of cold and heat. For instance, if the hands and feet are abnormally cold, accompanied by constipation and red urine, or black stool, with a pulse that is deep and slippery, this indicates a yang syndrome. For mild cases, use Baihu Decoction; for severe cases, use Chengqi Decoction. </p>
<p>In the case of cold damage and withdrawal, if blood and qi do not circulate, causing the limbs to become abnormally cold, this implies deep hidden heat, hence a deep state of cold. In such cases, urgently use a large dose of Chengqi Decoction with a supplementary laxative; immediate sweating will result. This aligns with Zhongjing&#39;s assertion that a cold state should be dealt with using laxatives. </p>
<p>Heat-induced cold (reversal of functions) is different from cold-induced cold. Heat-induced cold presents with slight reversal followed by fever. Conversely, in cold-induced cold, there is no fever but cold limbs with a greater feeling of chill, a deep and thin pulse, along with loose stools and urination. </p>
<p>Abnormal coldness in the hands and feet is referred to as &quot;reversal.&quot; Reversal indicates a lack of harmony between yin and yang, resulting in cold limbs. When yang energy weakens and yin energy strengthens, the yin prevails over the yang, causing the yang pulse to reverse and therefore blockage to the hands and feet, resulting in coldness.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>In cases of cold and heat in febrile diseases, when there is more cold and less heat, the illness is likely to recover; conversely, if there is more heat and less cold, the illness worsens. However, one must carefully distinguish between cold and heat-induced extremities. </p>
<p>Cold-induced extremities manifest as coldness in the limbs on the day of onset, with a pulse that is deep, weak, and not rapid. The feet often cramp, there is a preference for covering with clothing while lying down, a dislike for cold, or diarrhea with clear fluid, or a natural regulation of clear stools. Urination may be frequent, and external symptoms tend to be calm. If the pulse is deep and firm, but feels slow and weak upon pressure, it indicates cold-induced extremities. Appropriate remedies include Si Ni Decoction, Li Zhong Decoction, Tong Mai Si Ni Decoction, Dang Gui Si Ni Decoction, Dang Gui Si Ni with Fushen and Ginger Decoction, and Bai Tong with Pig Gall Bladder Decoction.</p>
<p>Heat-induced extremities, on the other hand, are characterized by fever and headache on the first day of illness, accompanied by other Yang symptoms. It typically takes two to five days for the extremities to become cold. In cases of mixed heat and cold extremities, cold will emerge within half a day, following the fever, as deep heat is necessary to induce extremities. This will usually manifest after two to three days.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>If the fainting leads to fever, it is due to the slight heat. Although the pulse is deep and concealed, upon palpation it is slippery, indicating internal heat. The person may fear the heat, drink water, or wave their hands and feet, feeling restless and unable to sleep, with constipation and red urine, and showing signs of confusion. This indicates heat fainting, and remedies like Bai Hu and Cheng Qi should be used accordingly. Zhongjing says that in cases of chills and fever lasting one to five days, fainting must occur, and if there was prior fever, fainting will follow. The deeper the fainting, the deeper the heat; the milder the fainting, the milder the heat. If fainting that requires purging instead induces sweating, the mouth must be severely damaged and ulcerated. Additionally, if all symptoms are present with the four extremities feeling cold, it indicates blood and qi stagnation after purging, leading to coldness in the limbs. If the physician misidentifies this as a condition of yin, and administers heat-inducing drugs, disaster will follow swiftly. Generally, in heat fainting, the pulse must be deep and slippery, with sweat on the head; even if the hands are cold, the fingertips may occasionally feel warm, and one should promptly apply Cheng Qi Decoction without hesitation. Any cold in the extremities pertains to fainting due to yin, and must not be purged or induced to sweat.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>When there is a need for warmth in the extremities or signs of sweat, it indicates that although the hands and feet feel cold and may occasionally warm up, the palms must be warm; this is not true reversal. This should be monitored. If the patient experiences chills and fever with a pale complexion, is unwell, and suddenly has no pulse in both hands or one hand, it is likely due to a real exhaustion of sweat. One should extensively wrap the hands and feet in cotton clothing to keep them warm and urgently take a recipe such as Schisandra decoction, or possibly a combination of Ephedra, Asarum, and Licorice decoction. At that time, there will likely be a significant sweat leading to relief.</p>
<p>When evil qi is trapped in the chest, it can also cause cold extremities, but recognizing a pulse that suddenly becomes blocked is key. Zang-exhaustion is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Inquiring about the Shaoyin Four-Reversal Decoction and the Four-Reversal Powder, one might ask why there is a distinction. The answer is that, generally, in Shaoyin illness, one should not hastily use warming medicines. Although there may be a surface heat in Shaoyin disease, which Zhang Zhongjing termed late-onset fever, one can still use combinations like Ephedra and Asarum to induce sweating without turning it into a true Shaoyin syndrome. In today’s cases, when the extremities are cold but there is internal heat, Zhang Zhongjing recommends the Four-Reversal Powder. The Four-Reversal Decoction employs Aconite and Dried Ginger, while the Four-Reversal Powder focuses on reversing the cold from the extremities; patients might cough, feel palpitations, have difficulty urinating, experience abdominal pain, or suffer from diarrhea and heavy stools—all of these are signs of heat conditions.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Fainting and Reversal</strong></p>
<p>The energy reverses and rushes upward due to the upward heat of fire. The bending and stretching are not convenient; thus, fainting and reversal are stubborn and fixed. The cold water (yin) leads to clarity, hence, when ill with cold, the limbs become cold and reverse, leading to a constraint that is solid and rigid, causing difficulty in stretching and bending. Therefore, in winter, the pulse is heavy, short, and firm, reflecting the symptoms of this illness. If an illness of cold is still mild and has not yet reached fainting and reversal, it cannot be mistaken for heat. Likewise, if there is severe heat leading to yang fainting, it should not be interpreted as cold. </p>
<p>For yin fainting, the original pulse and symptoms are all indicative of yin conditions: the body feels cool with no thirst, the pulse is slow, thin, and weak, with no evidence of yang conditions. For yang fainting, the original pulse and symptoms indicate yang conditions: extreme heat leads to reversal, and at times returns to warmth; even in fainting, there is agitation and thirst, with the body hot and pulse rapid. If yang fainting is very profound to the point of the body being cold with faint signs of a yin pulse that seems about to cease, it merely indicates extreme heat leading to a desire for death.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The common people mistakenly believe that transformation into a Yin disease occurs, claiming that the interplay of Yin and Yang, heat and cold, is unpredictable. They uphold the notion that Yang is associated with life while Yin corresponds to death, urgently applying fire and warming herbs to stimulate the surface and internal warmth, thus supporting Yang energy, resulting in a survival rate of one in ten. This leads to a widespread fear of Yin conditions, causing those with suspected Yin diseases to be urgently warmed, out of fear that failure to act will invite misfortune. Yet they overlook that those with severe heat illnesses rarely escape this condition. </p>
<p>They are unaware that the balance of Yin and Yang is what constitutes the Dao, while excess Yin or Yang results in illness. Yin and Yang achieve harmony through balance; imbalance causes disease. All things arise from the combination of Yin and Yang; therefore, excessive Yin cannot persist, and isolated Yang cannot thrive. When Yang energy is excessively strong and Yin energy is excessively weak, Yang becomes stagnant, leading to a tilt between Yin and Yang that prevents circulation. This results in cold extremities, known as Yang collapse. Thus, Zhang Zhongjing stated: &quot;When heat is profound, the collapse is likewise profound; when heat is slight, the collapse is slight.&quot; He also noted: &quot;Collapse should be addressed from below; once the heat inside is eliminated, the collapse will improve.&quot;<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Thus, when the disease heat is severe, there is a corresponding coldness. Moreover, if there is loss of lower energy, the heat worsens and manifests as a yin condition, not a transformation into a cold disease. The transmission and transformation of disease refer to the flow of pathological factors affecting the internal and external, upper and lower pathways of the body, rather than a mere reversal between cold and heat or yin and yang. The principle states: when yin and yang are balanced, there is harmony; when imbalanced, there is disease. For example, if yang is strong and yin is weak leading to heat, should it really transform into cold, it would be like when heat dissipates and cold arises, resulting in a balance of yin and yang which should lead to recovery. How could it become a cold disease? Although the discussion on malaria mentions that when yin prevails there is cold, and when yang prevails there is heat, it means that when interior energy and external heat are combined, there is yang predominance leading to fever; and when external energy and heat are combined, there is yin predominance leading to cold shivering. Due to superficial energy being weak and interior energy being hot, excess can be harmful, so counteractions are needed, hence the shivering. In general, it fundamentally stems from heat, not a cold disease.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>In cases of cold damage with alternating chills and fever, if the evil heat is superficial, it obstructs the right qi, hence the aversion to cold; if the evil heat is deep within, the evil is severe and unrestrained, leading to a disfavor of cold while the aversion turns toward heat. The interplay of exterior and interior continues, resulting in the alternation of chills and fever. This condition does not unify between exterior and interior, hence it differs from malaria where the chills and fever are mild; they arise from the transmission of heat to yin and yang on the surface, rather than a change in the yin and yang of the disease itself. Sometimes, if the disease is heat and the cold attack is excessive, the yang qi becomes weakened and yin qi increases excessively, leading to a subsequent condition of cold; this arises from overdosing on medication rather than natural fluctuations of cold and heat.</p>
<p>When the six qi become chaotic and manifest as disease, they do so by combining and coexisting as one illness. Wind, heat, and dryness often combine together, as do cold and dampness; however, it is rare for dissimilar natures to combine. When there is severe control leading to a combination, it is a manifestation of deficiency. For instance, when fire heat is extreme and water is used to control it, it may result in shivering; generally, this is due to excessive heat rather than cold qi, thus thirst arises indicating heat within, while shivering causes the desire to drink cold. Similarly, when fire refines metal and the heat is extreme leading to transformation into water, even though it becomes water, it is still fundamentally due to intense heat resulting in the essence of metal.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If there is excessive dryness and heat leading to stagnation in the intestines and stomach, or if drinking too much cold liquid causes obstruction and fullness, and retained fluids fail to transform and nourish due to extreme cold accumulating in the stomach, then excessive dryness and heat obstruct the chest and abdomen, causing bloating and incessant thirst, which in turn leads to cold pain in the stomach and chest, along with vomiting of watery substances, making it difficult to swallow. Attempting to quench thirst by drinking more water leads to increased fullness and pain and worsens the vomiting, yet the thirst remains unquenched. If one refrains from drinking, the unbearable thirst creates restlessness and distress, making one wish for death. Mismanagement can lead to death, and neglecting treatment is also quite difficult. </p>
<p>In such cases, we typically administer Da Chengqi Decoction hot to facilitate swallowing, which can relieve the stagnation in the intestines and stomach. This helps to transform and nourish the retained fluids, dispersing cold and dampness, thus allowing the stomach and intestines to regain moisture. As the heat subsides, the distress and thirst along with the bloating and vomiting cease, leading to quick relief. However, the causes of the illness must be understood. It is uncommon for a condition primarily caused by heat to transform into cold. Generally, when yang is strong, the pulse should be strong and rapid, accompanied by body heat and thirst; when heat becomes excessive, it leads to yang collapse.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>When it reaches the extreme, the body becomes cold and the pulse weakens, resembling symptoms of yin conditions, leading to a pulse cessation and death. Therefore, when a yang illness exhibits a yin pulse, it indicates the pulse is nearly gone, suggesting a fatal condition. Even if the illness is intensely hot, if it persists, there must be cold extremities and a weak pulse, eventually resulting in a cold body and pulse cessation followed by death. This could arise from the illness initially being too hot, from excessive treatment leading to worsening symptoms, from a loss of cold medicine for regulation, from improper treatment methods, or from mistakenly taking hot medicine or applying excessive heat, resulting in extreme heat causing yang collapse. In such cases, administering cold medicines like the Chaihu Decoction can reduce the heat and restore the balance, alleviating the collapse. It is crucial to avoid using harmful hot and toxic drugs like silver powder or croton seeds, as they will deplete yin energy and exhaust body fluids, exacerbating dry heat and causing serious complications such as breathlessness, abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, blood overflow, or various heat transformation symptoms. Such remedies are intended for breaking up hard accumulations, not for addressing heat or nourishing yin. The ancients noted that treating febrile diseases with hot, toxic preparations is akin to using a blade to harm someone.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>There was a case of excess yang where the person did not improve, resulting in a cold body and weak pulse, resembling a condition of yin. Mistakenly, hot medicines were administered, worsening the condition to the point that the body was cold, the pulse was weak and almost absent, with only a slight warmth in the chest and heart, leading to faintness and confusion, making the patient unable to speak. The doctor intended to use warming medicines to urgently revive the yang, fearing the disappearance of yang would lead to death. However, they did not realize this was caused by excessive heat disrupting the downward flow, and subsequently supplementing warmth exacerbated the issue. If more hot medicines were used to support the yang energy, the yin would suddenly deplete, resulting in the death of the yang energy as well; where would the yang energy be generated from then?</p>
<p>Some might ask: Why not urgently promote a downward flow? The answer is that if the yang is excessive and attacks the yin, leading the yin to deplete first, the yang will also be exhausted. At this moment, if one attempts to induce a downward flow, both yin and yang would cease, resulting in immediate death; thus, neglecting the situation would also lead to death. However, if the condition reaches a certain point, a gentle intervention can save them; in this case, one should use cold medicines to nourish the yin and slightly reduce the yang, making sure there is no violent purging. If the yin energy can gradually recover, salvation is possible. It is advisable to use a cooling remedy, as this can encourage the gradual recovery of yin energy. How can this be determined? It can be gauged by observing a gradual increase in warmth in the chest and heart, along with the gradual re-establishing of the pulse.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Throughout the day, there are three treatments; the pulse indicates a significantly deep and rapid state, the body surface is warm, yet there is a reversal of vital energy. There is a good tolerance for water, and sometimes responses to inquiries are delusional, with a strong tongue making it difficult to speak. By using the Decoction for Regulating the Stomach and Resolving Qi, one may achieve sweating and recovery. The so-called cold medicines can actually nourish the pulse and warm the body, because of a condition where yang is solid but yin is weak, leading towards death; the body turns cold and the pulse becomes faint. Now, by using cold medicines to nourish yin and reduce yang, one can avoid death. </p>
<p>Generally, when treating illness, it is essential to clarify the root and the branch. The branch is the initial symptom, while the root is the fundamental cause. Thus, the classics say that the initial illness is the root and subsequent illness is the branch; the root and branch are interrelated, and treatment should first address the urgent symptoms. It is also said that the six qi serve as the root, while the three yin and three yang are branches; thus, the pathogenic qi is the root, while the affected meridians and organs are branches. The subtlety of root and branch, treating them accordingly cannot be overlooked. Hence, the classics state that knowing what opposes and aligns is crucial; when the appropriate course is taken, there are no gaps.</p>
<p>To clearly understand root and branch ensures that all measures are apt. Ignorance of root and branch is called acting blindly. The interplay of yin and yang, and the relationship between root and branch is the pathway to knowledge. Is this not its principle? </p>
<p>In cases of one yang and one yin, if illness manifests with fright, back pain, and sighing, it is termed wind reversal. This is because the stomach (earth) and liver (wood) interact, as wood overcomes earth. When wind overcomes dampness and does not control kidney water, it causes a reversal upwards, with the herb Yuan Zhi identified as its chief remedy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Huang Liao</strong><br><strong>(By Jin Cheng Wuji)</strong>  </p>
<p>What explains the situation of the Four Reverses in Cold Damage? The &quot;Four Reverses&quot; refers to the limbs being reversed and not warm. Accumulated cold leads to coldness and accumulated warmth leads to heat; these conditions do not arise in just a day or night, but develop gradually over time. When Cold Damage first occurs, the evil is present in the skin. When the taiyang and yangming channels are affected, the whole body will feel hot; when the shaoyin and taiyin channels are impacted, the hands and feet will feel warm on their own, indicating the exterior evil has become milder and wishes to transmit inward. The classic states: &quot;In the case of Cold Damage, if after four or five days the hands and feet are warm and thirst arises, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be administered.&quot; This indicates that the evil in the taiyang has transmitted to the shaoyang. When the pulse is superficial and the hands and feet are warm on their own, it shows the condition is associated with the taiyin, meaning the shaoyang evil has transmitted to the taiyin. It is understood that when the evil energy is halfway between the exterior and interior, the hands and feet do not feel hot but remain warm. When the evil transmits to the shaoyin, it indicates that the interior condition is severe; even though it has not yet manifested as cold extremities, the hands and feet become even less warm, which is identified as the Four Reverses. If it reaches the jueyin stage, the hands and feet will feel cold.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The Classic text states: When a person has a condition characterized by cold limbs—whether by coughing, palpitations, difficulty urinating, abdominal pain, or severe diarrhea—this is diagnosed as a &quot;Four Reversals&quot; condition. The treatment is &quot;Four Reversal Powder,&quot; which consists of four ingredients: Chai Hu, Zhi Shi, Shao Yao, and Gan Cao. All of these are cold in nature yet specifically treat the Four Reversal illness, indicating that this condition is not merely a sign of excessive coldness. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are also &quot;Four Reversal Decoctions&quot; which treat the coldness in the hands and feet using warming herbs like Gan Jiang and Fu Zi, which is very effective against the illness. If the hands and feet generate warmth but then turn cold, this condition is caused by an internal disturbance, and the &quot;Four Reversal Powder&quot; shall treat it. If one begins to experience chilly hands and feet that do not warm up, this indicates that the Yin channels are afflicted and Yang Qi is insufficient; &quot;Four Reversal Decoction&quot; can be used to warm it. </p>
<p>It is crucial to recognize this to avoid misunderstandings. The conditions of Four Reversals and cold extremities are similar but not the same. The text states: &quot;Any severe case of Four Reversal cold should not be treated as diarrhea,&quot; indicating that Four Reversals and cold are distinctly different. Severe symptoms accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, and irritability suggest serious danger in the case of Four Reversals. Diagnosis should be conducted with care and thoroughness! </p>
<p>Regarding cold in febrile diseases, how can it be clarified? Cold indicates a worse condition than Four Reversals. The text notes: &quot;Coldness arises when Yin and Yang energies do not correspond effectively.&quot; Coldness manifests as reversing coldness in the hands and feet.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>It is said that when the yang energy sinks inward and the heat energy reverses and stagnates, the hands and feet become cold. The classics state that if one has a cold damage for one or two days and experiences reversal after four or five days, then fever must arise. The previous heat will inevitably be followed by reversal. The deeper the reversal, the deeper the heat; the milder the reversal, the milder the heat. Thus, it is known that when there is sinking inward, the hands and feet are in reversal. In lesser yin diseases, there is only reversal without sweating, and if one forces sweating, it will certainly move the blood, but one does not know through which channel it will exit, either through the mouth and nose or from the eyes. This is termed &quot;lower reversal with upper exhaustion,&quot; and it also refers to activating the heat. If the fever comes first and is followed by reversal, it means the heat is hidden within; if reversal comes first and is followed by fever, it means the yin has receded and the yang energy has recovered. If one initially experiences reversal, it signifies that the yang energy is insufficient while the yin energy is dominant. Generally, reversal is governed by the yin, and cold is prevalent, with distinctions of progress and retreat. The classic states: If one has reversal for five days, there will also be heat for five days. If after six days there is no reversal, recovery will occur. If fever lasts for four days and reversal lasts for three days, recovery will ensue if fever returns for four days with minimal reversal and much heat. If there is reversal for four days, fever for three days, followed by reversal for five days, the condition progresses.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>When cold is abundant and heat is scarce, it indicates the retreat of yang energy, thus leading to progression. If illness reaches the Jueyin, the meridians are completely exhausted. At such a time, yang energy prevails over yin; hence, there is little cold and much heat, and the illness improves. However, if yin energy exceeds, and yang cannot recover, there will be much cold and little heat, causing the illness to reverse. Cold is the arrival of yin energy, while heat represents the recovery of yang energy. When it comes to diarrhea, it is said that there will be cold first, then heat will emerge, and the diarrhea will surely stop, indicating that the cold must recover leading to the cessation of diarrhea. Cold is the manifestation of heat, as yang energy recovers, leading to the inevitable cessation of diarrhea. Heat, in turn, signifies the return of cold, implying that yin energy is once again prevailing, thus causing the recurrence of diarrhea. </p>
<p>The yang energies reside within the chest; when evil energies reside in the chest, stagnation occurs, preventing yang energy from dispersing, leading to coldness in the hands and feet. The texts state: &quot;When there is cold in the hands and feet, the pulse is intermittently tense, evil is obstructed in the chest, the heart feels full and distressed, and hunger does not allow for eating; illness in the chest should be expelled.&quot; This is the manifestation of excessive yin. If there is even worse cold leading to curling up, the yin energy is extremely strong and difficult to control. The texts say: &quot;In lesser yin disorders, if there is aversion to cold, curling of the body, diarrhea, and cold in the hands and feet, it is untreatable.&quot; This indicates that cold is a reversal; can divine elixirs create life?<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Attitude Towards Parents</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Condition of Syncope in Recent Times</strong> </p>
<p>Syncope describes a state where the hands and feet, as well as below the knees, can feel either cold or hot. The world generally holds that &quot;kicking leg disease&quot; is an ailment caused by cold and dampness, yet &quot;The Internal Classic&quot; does not mention this condition. Wang Taifu also stated that there was originally no such disease; it was later defined by &quot;The Book of Broad Treatments.&quot; In ancient texts, what we call &quot;kicking leg disease&quot; refers to the condition of syncope. However, syncope should be differentiated into two types, which are then subdivided into five organ categories. The two types are cold syncope and hot syncope. When yang energy is weak below, it leads to cold syncope; when yin energy is weak below, it results in hot syncope. Hot syncope manifests as hot hands and feet, while cold syncope manifests as cold hands and feet. Yang meridians originate from the surface of the toes, while yin meridians begin from the soles of the feet. When yang energy is strong, there is heat in the lower parts; when yin energy is strong, there is cold. Furthermore, it’s said that yang governs the exterior and syncope occurs in the interior, while yin governs the interior and syncope occurs in the exterior. This is because the energies of yin and yang are reversed and move upwards. In spring and summer, yang is abundant and yin is scarce; in autumn and winter, yin strengthens and yang weakens. People may rely on their vigor and indulge during autumn and winter, leading to a depletion of internal yang and a surplus of essence that flows downward, allowing evil energy to rise. When yang energy declines, true essence is also exhausted, which causes the body not to nourish; thus, yin energy operates alone, resulting in cold hands and feet, which is classified as cold syncope.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>When a person enters a room drunk and full, the energy accumulates in the spleen and stomach, dominating the flow of fluids. If the yin energy is weak and the yang energy enters, the stomach becomes unbalanced. If the stomach is unbalanced, the essence and vitality wither, and when the essence withers, the limbs are not nourished. The effects of alcohol and food gas combine to create internal heat, leading to red urine; the energy becomes robust yet reckless. When the kidney energy is weakened and yang energy prevails alone, the hands and feet become hot and lead to heat syncope. </p>
<p>There is also syncope that causes a person to feel abdominal fullness without awareness; some may regain awareness after one or two days, while others may suddenly become confused and lose consciousness, all due to chaos caused by external pathogens and rebellious yang energy, leading to insufficient motion in the shaoyin kidney meridian. When the kidney energy is minimal, the essence and blood scatter, forcing energy upwards into the chest cavity where the ancestral energy stagnates beneath the heart, and yang energy retreats downwards. The heat returns to the yin lower regions, assisting the yin and causing loss of sensation in the body. </p>
<p>Moreover, the five vessels converge in the ears; if all five are blocked, it causes bodily pulses to stir while the form remains oblivious, resembling a corpse, hence it is called corpse syncope. There may be drooling like a dragging saw, with sounds in the throat representing phlegm syncope. Twitching of the hands and feet indicates wind syncope. If this occurs due to intoxication, it is called alcohol syncope; if from sudden anger, it is termed qi syncope. Bone pain and nail brittleness represent bone syncope. Sudden cramping and inability to flex or extend the toes signify arm syncope. A body that is rigid like a plank represents liver syncope. Shortness of breath and lamentation, accompanied by frantic running or climbing, correspond to yangming syncope. All these result from rebellious energy.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Jue Men</p>

       Differentiation of Jue in Shao Han Si Ni

 Cheng WujI noted in his commentary on &quot;On Cold Damage&quot; that Si Ni refers to the coldness of the four limbs. Jue signifies cold hands and feet. When the cold pathogen affects the three Yang channels, the hands and feet are bound to feel hot; when it reaches the Tai Yin channel, the hands and feet will self-warm; but when it descends to the Shao Yin, the pathogen&#39;s heat intensifies, resulting in coldness of the four limbs, leading to even greater Jue. The classics state: in Shao Yin disease with Si Ni, a person may cough, experience palpitations, have difficulty urinating, suffer abdominal pain, or endure severe diarrhea. The treatment for Si Ni should use Si Ni San, which consists of Chai Hu, Zhi Shi, Shao Yao, and Gan Cao, all of which are cold substances specifically targeting the Si Ni condition, indicating that Si Ni is not solely a manifestation of empty cold. Si Ni and Jue are similar but distinct. The classics further state: various manifestations of Si Ni and Jue should not be treated with purgation, illustrating the differences between Si Ni and Jue.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a>

<p>Ah! This statement! Is it not supposed to indicate something very close to reason yet very confusing in truth? I have attempted to examine it; the words of Zhongjing regarding &quot;sijue&quot; and &quot;jue&quot; are not the same: some say &quot;sijue,&quot; some say &quot;jue,&quot; some say &quot;jue逆,&quot; some say &quot;jue冷,&quot; some say &quot;jue寒,&quot; some say &quot;hands and feet reverse cold,&quot; some say &quot;hands and feet jue逆,&quot; some say &quot;hands and feet jue冷,&quot; or &quot;hands and feet jue逆冷.&quot; Upon detailed examination, they all refer to cold. Therefore, the two words &quot;jue逆&quot; are often used interchangeably, and there has never been a distinction made where &quot;逆&quot; denotes warmth and &quot;厥&quot; denotes cold. However, the limbs and hands and feet should be distinguished. The addition of the character &quot;四&quot; (four) before &quot;逆&quot; refers broadly to general coldness in the hands and feet, while the addition of &quot;手足&quot; (hands and feet) to &quot;jue逆,&quot; &quot;jue冷,&quot; etc., refers specifically to hands and feet. Whenit states &quot;not warm,&quot; it indicates cold; what difference could there be? What Zhongjing refers to as various &quot;sijue&quot; and &quot;jue&quot; should not be mistaken for being treated differently; &quot;sijue&quot; denotes general cold in the four limbs and &quot;jue&quot; refers specifically to the cold in the hands and feet, while the arms and legs above are not cold. It does not imply there is a distinction between &quot;逆&quot; and &quot;厥&quot; regarding warmth and cold. Therefore, it is stated that &quot;jue&quot; means hands and feet reverse cold. This explains that &quot;逆冷&quot; and &quot;厥&quot; convey the same meaning; thus, &quot;逆&quot; is equivalent to &quot;厥,&quot; and &quot;厥&quot; to &quot;逆.&quot; Hence, the dictionaries state: &quot;厥&quot; means &quot;逆.&quot;<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>Although both types of counterflow are associated with cold, there are distinctions between yin and yang. When heat reaches its extreme and leads to counterflow, yang resembles yin; when cold reaches its extreme and leads to counterflow, there is only yin without yang. When yang resembles yin, one must use cold herbs; when there is only yin without yang, one must use hot herbs. Zhongjing treated the condition of four reversals with cold herbs using Si Ni San, which addresses the case where yang resembles yin. For those who do not use the hot herbs in Si Ni Tang to treat the four reversals, how can they be sure that it is not due to a loss of original balance? Moreover, the name &quot;Si Ni Tang&quot; derives from the coldness in the four limbs. Now, using Si Ni Tang to treat the cold hands and feet, is it not essentially the same as counterflow? Since &quot;Si Ni&quot; indicates the limbs are cold, and &quot;counterflow&quot; refers to hands and feet being particularly cold, why then is the medicine for counterflow not named &quot;Si Jue Tang&quot;? Cheng proposed in the context of treating four reversals that the condition is due to heat evil, and he also stated in the &quot;Ming Li Lun&quot; that four reversals are not signs of mere cold deficiency.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>As for the death signs in Shaoyin disease mentioned in the two sections below, it states that the condition of Sini (four reversals) indicates severe cold. If this is the case, can it not contradict its own argument? It is understood that Sini is similar to the condition of extremities being cold or hot, and it cannot be said that Sini is solely caused by evil heat. However, if all four limbs are uniformly cold, compared to just the hands and feet being cold, there is a difference. Thus, Zhongjing said: In Shaoyin disease, those who have vomiting, diarrhea, agitation, and Sini are to die. He also said: In Shaoyin disease, if there is Sini with aversion to cold, the body curled up, the pulse not present, and no agitation but restlessness, they will die. He further stated: In Shaoyin disease, if there is vomiting, diarrhea, and coldness in the hands and feet, with restlessness and a desire to die, Wuzhuyu decoction is the main treatment. Among these three statements, two indicate death and one indicates treatability; although they manifest through various symptoms, the death cases are described with Sini, while the treatable case refers to the coldness in the extremities. This shows a distinction in severity between Sini and the coldness of the hands and feet. If all four limbs are uniformly cold, the condition is severe; whereas if only the hands and feet are cold, the condition is light. Even women and children can understand this. Cheng argues, how can the condition of extremities be worse than the reversals? If one can understand the differences between Sini and the coldness of the extremities, it is evident that Sini refers specifically to the hands and feet, while the former encompasses the arms, legs, and above. Thus, it is unnecessary to create convoluted explanations about warmth and cold, and clarity will naturally be achieved.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reversal of Extremities</strong>  </p>
<p>Reversal of extremities refers to the hands and feet becoming cold due to reversed qi and blood. This condition mainly arises from qi deficiency, but can also be due to blood deficiency. In qi deficiency, the pulse is thin; in blood deficiency, the pulse is large. During heat reversal, the pulse is rapid; with external pathogens, the pulse is deep and strong; with phlegm, the pulse is wiry. For phlegm, use Atractylodes and bamboo sap; for qi deficiency, the Four Gentlemen Decoction; for blood deficiency, the Four Substances Decoction; for heat reversal, use the Major Order Decoction; for external pathogens, use the Double Relief Powder with ginger juice and wine. There are also yin reversal and yang reversal: when yin declines below, it causes heat; when yang declines below, it causes cold. Additionally, if there is numbness in the hands and feet, it indicates qi deficiency; if the hands and feet are stiff, it pertains to damp phlegm and stagnant blood; numbness in all ten fingers indicates damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach. </p>
<p>Reversal signifies severity, brevity, and opposition, where the hands and feet feel cold and reversed. The symptoms vary widely, and the methods for dispersing them are numerous; here, I will briefly summarize. For example, in cases of cold and heat reversal, it represents the dual reversals of yin and yang. Yang reversal occurs when heat is deep, as excessive yang leads to reversal; one must not treat this as a yin condition with heat remedies, as it could result in the spirit and essence being extinguished, leading to death. Urgently apply the Major and Minor Order Decoctions, adapting to the severity of the case.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>The term &quot;Yin Jue&quot; refers to a condition where the body becomes cold, the pulse is deep, the limbs are cold, the feet curl up while lying down, the lips and mouth appear blue, and there may be spontaneous diarrhea without thirst, with urination that is pale. These are the signs to observe. Treat it with warming medicines like Si Ni San and Li Zhong Wan, and promptly apply moxibustion to the lower abdomen a hundred times.</p>
<p>&quot;Shi Jue&quot;, &quot;Fei Shi&quot;, and &quot;Zuo Jue&quot; are symptoms that suggest a serious condition caused by invasion of malevolent qi. It can happen suddenly and may cause coldness in the hands and feet, the skin can become bumpy, the face may turn dark, the spirit may be disturbed, and the person could speak nonsensically, tighten their jaws, or become unconscious and disoriented. These symptoms may arise after exposure to funerals, entering temples, or ascending graves. Administer Su He Wan; if there is slight recovery, follow with Qiao Qi San or Ping Wei San, known as the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder.</p>
<p>&quot;Phlegm Jue&quot; occurs due to cold phlegm causing blockage, resulting in cold limbs. Ginger and Fu Zi Decoction is recommended, using raw Fu Zi instead of cooked.</p>
<p>&quot;Tai Jue&quot; results from cold in the stomach. The text states that &quot;Tai&quot; refers to a long worm. Coldness in the stomach can lead to the expulsion of tapeworms. Use Li Zhong Tang with five fried Sichuan peppers and half a penny of betel nut, swallowing with Wu Mei Wan for effect. Tapeworms are subdued by Sichuan peppers.</p>
<p>&quot;Qi Jue&quot; is similar to a stroke. How does one distinguish between them? In a wind stroke, the body feels warm, while with Qi Jue, the body feels cold. Use Ba Wei Shun Qi San or Qiao Qi San; if phlegm is present, administer Si Qi Decoction or Phlegm Resolving Decoction.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong><br><strong>By Luo Tianyi (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the yang is reversed, the hands and feet may feel cold, though at times they may be warm; the palms and soles will surely feel warm. The pulse may be deep and hidden, but upon pressing, it is slippery. Symptoms may include a fear of heat, thirst for water, restlessness with the desire to toss and turn, difficulty sleeping, constipation, and red urine. This condition is called heat reversal, which the ancients referred to as yang reaching its extreme and then reversing. For treatment, one can use Bai Hu Decoction, Da Cheng Qi Decoction, Shuang Jie San, and Liang Ge San, carefully selecting based on the severity of symptoms.</p>
<p>In contrast, for yin reversal, the limbs are cold, the body is not hot, there may be nausea, curling of the feet while lying down, or the inclination to cover oneself with clothes or blankets. There is often no thirst or diarrhea, or normal bowel movements may occur; the pulse is deep, faint, and not rapid; although it may be deep and solid, it is slow and weak upon palpation. This condition is called cold reversal. For treatment, one can use Tong Mai Si Ni Decoction, or Dang Gui Si Ni Decoction, or Bai Tong with pig gallbladder juice.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>If a patient experiences chills and fever with cold extremities, a dull complexion, sudden loss of pulse in both hands, or in one hand, this indicates the potential for a productive sweat.

It is also acceptable not to use medication to assist, as sweating will naturally occur.</p>
<p>For various ailments with cold and clammy hands and feet, or slightly elevated body temperature, and a pulse that is deep, thin, weak, and accompanied by restlessness, treat with Si Ni Tang plus green onion, or Bai Tong with pig gallbladder soup, or Ren Shen San Bai Tang with bamboo shavings, or Wu You San; choose among these methods as suitable. For cold hands and feet with a thin and weak pulse and incoherent speech, treat with Si Ni Tang; for a cool body with cold hands and feet and a weak sound, use Si Ni Tang; if the body is cold with cold extremities and hiccups, apply Si Ni Tang plus Ren Shen; if there is vomiting and slight body heat, or cold extremities or restlessness with weak pulse, use Si Ni Tang; if there is vomiting with cold hands and feet or restlessness, treat with Si Ni Tang. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In the section on Qi Counterflow from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: Counterflow is a reverse of Qi. Any shift from cold to heat, or if heat is deeply rooted and causes trembling, or if there is excessive cold leading to agitation, are all termed as counterflow, not limited to just cold hands and feet. The zong muscle corresponds to the yin vessels, with the liver and spleen meridians closely associated with the zong muscle. In cold counterflow, the yin contracts and the limbs are cold; in heat counterflow, the fluids dry up and fail to nourish the limbs, resulting in red urine and hot hands and feet. Thus, the counterflow of the six meridians is all unified under the liver and spleen. When the pathogenic factor from cold damage affects the three yang meridians, the limbs feel warm. If it’s half exterior and half interior, affecting the taiyin, the pathogen gradually penetrates inward, making the limbs warm. If it reaches the shaoyin counterflow, the pathogen enters deeply and remains embedded internally, leading to cold limbs. However, if heat leads to counterflow, it is heat counterflow through the channels, where mild cases can be treated with formulas like Si Ni San, Bai Hu Tang, or Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang, and severe cases may require Da Chai Hu Cheng Qi Decoction. If the pathogen abruptly clogs the chest, causing restlessness and lack of appetite along with counterflow, Guati San can help expel it.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Bai Wen,&quot; heat counterflow and cold counterflow are different. Heat counterflow is when there is mild counterflow alongside fever. In contrast, cold counterflow presents without fever, with cold limbs, a deep and thin pulse, loose stools, aversion to cold, and blue-tinted nails. Additionally, if there is failure to descend, resulting in blocked blood flow with cold limbs leading to counterflow, a physician might misinterpret it as yin counterflow, leading to disastrous consequences if treated with formulas for counterflow like Si Ni. Generally, heat counterflow has a deep and slippery pulse, sweat on the forehead, warm palms, and warm fingertips, and is appropriately treated with downward actions. This is the subtle intention of Zhongjing.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Hui Jue</p>
<p>The term &quot;Hui&quot; refers to the roundworm, and it is also called &quot;Jue.&quot; This condition belongs to the Jue Yin category of diseases, characterized by the extremities being cold and reversed. Patients typically have a history of consuming roundworms, or it may be due to illness and excessive hunger, where the worms ascend to the throat. If one excessively sweats, this leads to stomach coldness, allowing the worms to rise and attack the throat, causing a deficiency of stomach qi, resulting in an inability to eat even when hungry. When a person eats, if they vomit up the worms, it is because the worms detect the smell of food and emerge. </p>
<p>Externally, symptoms may fluctuate between calmness and agitation, indicating that the worms may be either active or at rest. There may also be diarrhea due to cold in the internal organs, which causes the worms to move upward into the throat. Thus, when the upper part of the body is hot while the middle and lower parts are cold, symptoms of agitation, heat, and thirst may arise, accompanied by constipation. It is unwise to quickly use cooling medicines in this case. One should first use Wu Mei pills or Li Zhong Decoction to calm the roundworms, and then adjust treatment according to the symptoms. If agitation and heat persist, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may be used. If there is significant heat, confusion, abdominal distension, constipation, or if the roundworms are restless and expelled with bowel movements, then Da Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Yin Jue</strong></p>
<p>Yin Jue refers to a condition where there is no headache, no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea before the onset of the attack, and there is a lack of thirst and a tendency to curl up; this occurs because the Yin pathogenic factor is predominant. The hands and feet are extremely cold, and this is governed by the Jue Yin, as the interaction of Yin and Yang qi does not harmonize, which is different from the gradual cooling seen in Sì Nì (Four Reverses). In cases of Tài Yīn Jue, where the hands and feet are slightly cold, the remedy is Lǐ Zhōng Tānɡ. In Shào Yīn Jue, if the shins are cold and the feet are cold, and if severe, the hands and arms are cold up to the knees; the remedies are Sì Nì Tāng or Tōnɡ Mài Sì Nì Tāng. In Jue Yīn Jue, if the entire body is cold, the appropriate remedy is Dāng Guī Sì Nì Tāng. If there is agitation and counterflow, it should not be treated. According to “Bǎi Wèn,” cold Jue initially presents with coldness in the limbs, a submerged and thin pulse, and restless legs while lying down, possibly accompanied by aversion to cold, bluish nails, self-covering with clothing, or clear diarrhea, or self-regulating clear stools, frequent urination, and external symptoms of clarity; this is cold Jue, for which Sì Nì Tāng or Sān Wèi Shēn Yú Tāng can be chosen. Generally, conditions with more heat and less Jue are easier to treat, while more Jue and less heat are harder to remedy. There is also blood Jue, treated with Sì Wù Tāng; qi Jue with Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng; summer Jue with Bái Hǔ Tāng; water Jue presents as palpitations below the heart, treated with Fú Líng Guì Gān Tāng; corpse Jue occurs due to toxin, caused by the offensive and improper atmosphere, and is treated with Mù Xiāng Yūn Qì Sǎn combined with Píng Wèi Sǎn or Zhuī Hūn Tāng. Worm Jue was mentioned earlier.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Yang Jue</p>
<p>Yang jue refers to the condition where, before the onset of a fit, there are symptoms such as headache, body heat, profuse sweating, constipation, thirst, and delirium. When the pathogen deeply infiltrates, it hides within and then leads to the fit. After a slight fit, within half a day, there is a recurrence of heat. If the heat descends, it results in abdominal pain, diarrhea with a feeling of heaviness, producing thick, sticky yellowish-red stools, likely containing pus and blood. If there is no blood in the stools, but heat rises, it will lead to a sore throat. Additionally, if the heat-induced fit persists for seven days without relief, there will inevitably be pus and blood in the stools. In the case of Yin jue, the symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea with clear stools, and not feeling thirsty; this reflects the specific nature of Yin jue, so one should refer back to the discussion on Yang jue.</p>
<p>External Invasion of Cold and Heat</p>
<p>Cold leading to blood and subsequent fits, with a pulse that is deep and weak, should be treated with Li Zhong Decoction or Si Ni Decoction. Heat that exhausts qi leading to fits, with a weak pulse, should be treated with Bai Hu Decoction or a modified Xiao Feng San with Qiang Huo. In summer, if labor commences which disturbs Yang Qi, leading to symptoms such as blindness and deafness, the Inner Canon refers to this as &quot;boiling fit,&quot; indicating the heat forces damaging the kidneys and bladder. The appropriate treatment is Si Jun Zi Decoction, plus Yuan Zhi, Fang Feng, Chi Shao, Mai Men Dong, and Chen Pi. For any external causes leading to fits, it is advisable to add ginger juice to the dispersing medicines.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p>
<h3>Internal Injuries from the Seven Emotions</h3>
<p>Internal causes of injuries from joy and anger harm the qi and impair aspiration. When qi reverses and does not flow downwards, blood accumulates in the heart and chest. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; refers to this as “slight collapse,” indicating an imbalance of yin and yang leading to turbulent qi and blood. In cases of severe cold from reversed qi, &quot;Suhexiang Pills&quot; and &quot;Eight Flavor Releasing Qi Powder&quot; can be applied. If anger causes intense reversal, resulting in vomiting blood or nosebleeds leading to collapse, modifications to &quot;Four Substances Decoction&quot; are made by removing Rehmannia and adding Red Poria, Ginseng, Platycodon, Aged Tangerine Peel, Ophiopogon, and Areca Nut, to be taken with ginger decoction, or &quot;Six Depression Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>For abundant anger causing sudden shouting and collapse, phlegm is blocking upwards while fire rises from below, hence the use of five qian of Cyperus, seven qian of Chuanxiong, and three qian of fresh Licorice, boiled in the urine of children with ginger juice. Additionally, Qingdai (Indigo) and Human Zhongbai along with Cyperus made into pills may provide some relief, combined with &quot;Phlegm Releasing Decoction&quot; plus Huanglian and Cyperus, or swallowing &quot;Angelica Dragon and Honey Pills.&quot;</p>
<p>Injuries from labor, drinking, or being startled causing collapse can be treated with &quot;Six Gentlemen Decoction&quot; adding Qin, Lian, Bamboo Juice, and ginger juice. </p>
<p>For internal injuries from phlegm-fire leading to collapse, a wiry and slippery pulse indicates the use of &quot;Erchen Decoction&quot; with Bamboo Juice. If there’s a cold condition, add fresh Aconite; if there’s a fiery condition, add Qin, Lian, Mountain Gardenia, and Bamboo Juice; for overweight individuals, add Ginseng and ginger juice. </p>
<p>All forms of collapse can result in dizziness, fainting spells, hallucinations, or abdominal distension with difficulty in urination and defecation, or vomiting or heart pain, all indicative of phlegm-fire obstructing qi.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Zang Jue</strong></p>
<p>Fever lasting seven to eight days, pulse thin, skin cold and restlessness, with vomiting or diarrhea, and no brief relief at any time—this is the true Qi of the Zang Yin exhausted, hence called Zang Jue. Zhongjing has no treatment, only the use of Si Ni Tang and cold drinks to rescue. In cases of Shao Yin Jue with vomiting, diarrhea, and restlessness, this is also not treated, but rescued with San Wei Shen Yu Tang.</p>
<p><strong>Caused by Alcohol and Lust</strong></p>
<p>Heat Jue occurs from excess drinking and indulgence, resulting in dampness stagnating in the Spleen Earth, unable to nourish the four limbs. Yang Qi is alone strong, thus causing palms and soles to feel hot. For this, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, Sheng Yang San Huo Tang, or Huo Yu Tang. </p>
<p>Cold Jue occurs from excessive desires draining essence, severely damaging the Yuan Yang, unable to nourish the meridians, with Yin Qi predominating, hence all limbs feel cold. For this, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Fu Zi, or Dang Gui Si Ni Tang. </p>
<p>When ordinary Qi deficiency causes Jue, use Si Jun Zi Tang; for blood deficiency Jue, use Si Wu Tang. If there is heat, add Zhi Mu or Huang Bai; if there is deficiency-cold, add Fu Zi. However, cold Jue often arises from being overpowered. For example, if Kidney cold invades the Spleen, it leads to cold Jue; if Heart heat invades the Kidney, it leads to heat Jue—this applies across the Six Meridians. </p>
<p>In acute discussions, Yang signs include thirst, delirium, and body heat; Yin signs show no thirst, lethargy, and coolness. This is similar to Yang Jue and Yin Jue in febrile diseases. Yet, mixed diseases often originate from alcohol, lust, and emotional disturbances, with few from external pathogens. Thus it is said that when Yang declines above, it causes cold Jue; when Yin declines below, it causes heat Jue. Yang extremes resemble Yin, and Yin extremes resemble Yang. Although the causes of febrile diseases differ, the variations in symptoms are also similar.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>Corpse Stiffness</strong> </p>
<p>When one encounters a case of hanging or a disease related to death, or enters a temple and ascends a tomb, if suddenly afflicted by external evil influences, and faces opposition from internal toxicities, the qi becomes obstructed and fails to circulate; the meridians and pulse are suppressed, leading to confusion and loss of awareness. Suddenly, the hands and feet become cold, the face turns dark blue, the jaw tightens, and one may faint abruptly, possibly speaking nonsensically. It is critical not to treat this as a form of wind illness. First, administer the Suhexiang pill to awaken the patient; once they regain consciousness, use a combination of mukxiang and Pingwei powder to harmonize and adjust the qi. </p>
<p>For those who are fundamentally weak, use five qian of sulfur and two qian of nitre, ground together into powder, and administer three doses prepared with a cup of aged wine, ensuring the sulfur is activated before pouring it into the cup to be taken warm, similar to a person walking five li and then taking another dose. If the previous medicines are unavailable, use the Ginseng and Aconite Decoction mixed with ginger juice and wine instead. Externally, perform moxibustion on the Baihui point with moxa the size of a mung bean for nine applications, and on the Qihai point for a hundred applications; if the body is warm, there&#39;s a chance for recovery. </p>
<p>For those who died suddenly, administer the Chasing Soul Decoction. </p>
<p><strong>Treatment principles</strong>: </p>
<p>When the yin and yang qi do not connect, it results in stiffness. For heat-induced stiffness, tonify the yin; for cold-induced stiffness, tonify the yang. The standard meridians indicate that supporting the dominant water calms the yang light, while enriching the source of fire dissipates the shadow of yin. </p>
<p>In cases of sudden stiffness that have yet to be diagnosed, first administer the Suhexiang pill to awaken the patient. If there is phlegm blocking the mouth, use Guadi powder to induce vomiting, or it may be expelled through the nose as well. In cases of severe heat, apply the Dachengqi Decoction or the Shuangjiesan to purge. </p>
<p><strong>Medical Classics Must Reads</strong> 【Ming, Li Zhongzi】<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Damp Injury</strong></p>
<p>Those suffering from damp injury are affected by dampness, feeling heavy and painful in the body, with spontaneous sweating, slight fever, coldness in the lower legs, heaviness in the limbs, and a sense of fullness and discomfort in the chest and abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In yang deficiency, the body is quiet, breathing is short, vision is blurred, breathing through the nose is difficult, difficulty in inhaling, fluids are not accepted, inability to control urination, the face appears pale and blackened as if scraped, or shows a preference for lying against a wall with closed eyes, not wanting to see anyone. The breath from the nose is cold, lips are not red, may appear white, blue, or purple, hands and feet are cold, nails are bluish or purplish, urine is white or light yellow, stools are loose, and upon pressing the stomach, there is heaviness without significant heat. If there is excessive yin, the cold may penetrate to the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>Yin toxicity arises from a deficiency of the kidney and coldness, possibly from consuming cold substances, exposure to cold evil, or from sweating, vomiting, or purging, developing into yin toxicity. Symptoms include headache, abdominal cramping pain, eye pain, fatigue without significant heat, coldness in the limbs, cold sweat on the forehead and backs of the hands, diffuse pain in the body, unceasing spontaneous sweating, retching sounds, weak and shallow pulse, or a weak pulse at the inch and strong at the cubit. It is treatable within five days, but after six or seven days, it becomes difficult to treat. If cold damage progresses to the three yin, expect coldness in the limbs, abdominal pain and vomiting, cold saliva, fear of cold with shivering, a face appearing as if scraped, curled up clothing, a slow and soft pulse, and immediate warming is necessary. For lighter cases, use the &quot;Regulating Middle Decoction&quot;; for heavier cases, use the &quot;Four Reverse Decoction.&quot; If the initial sickness does not present a fever but shows cold symptoms, it is termed a direct involvement of the yin channels and is similarly treated with these two decoctions.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Similar Symptoms of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms that resemble Yang but are actually Yin include irritability, flushed face, feverish body, sore throat and thirst, a floating and faint pulse, cold hands and feet, diarrhea, clear urination, and excessive drowsiness. Additionally, there may be a feverish feeling accompanied by a desire for clothing, no thirst, and darkening nails, indicating an internal excess of Yin with true Yang lost. </p>
<p>If there is syncope, sweating is not allowed.<br>For syncope with reverse symptoms, vomiting is not permitted.<br>In cases of reverse pulse that feels deep and thin, curled up with aversion to cold, covering oneself with clothes, not drinking water, and resulting in clear diarrhea, use Si Ni Tang. If the pulse is absent, use Tong Mai Si Ni Tang. If the pulse is slow and weak, use Li Zhong Tang. When hands and feet are slightly cold, it is termed &quot;clear,&quot; and Li Zhong Tang should be used. For syncope with heat, employ Huangqi Ren Shen Jian Zhong Tang. If there is thirst with syncope, use Bai Hu Tang. If there is palpitations, first treat the condition using Fuling Gan Cao Tang. If there is syncope with heat and sleeplessness accompanied by delirium, Bai Hu Tang is indicated. </p>
<p>When Yang is obstructed by evil in the chest, the Yang Qi fails to manifest, causing cold and reversal in the hands and feet, and the pulse becomes tense intermittently, leading to fullness and irritability in the heart, indicating a disease located in the chest. Zhongjing used Guadi San to induce vomiting. </p>
<p>If there is initial fever followed by syncope with symptoms such as raised hands and thrown feet, irritability, aversion to heat when drinking, constipation, and dark urination, it indicates deep heat and serious syncope, with a deep and slippery pulse, sweating on the head and face, and warm nails, all suggesting lurking heat, treated with Da Xia Cheng Qi Tang. </p>
<p>Severe Yin with vomiting and irritability leads to death from reverse symptoms.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>When experiencing cold limbs and diarrhea, one may be unable to eat; if they suddenly regain the ability to eat, this is called &quot;removing the center,&quot; and it leads to death. In lesser yin disease, if one experiences cold limbs, reverse pulse, and has no pulse, and is treated with Bai Tong pig bile soup, if the pulse suddenly reappears, it indicates death. Excessive drinking and eating, or exposure to wind-cold, or being provoked by anger can lead to a blockage in the chest, preventing stomach qi from moving properly, resulting in sudden cold limbs, confusion, inability to speak, and inability to lift limbs. If mistakenly treated for stroke, this will certainly lead to death. It is advisable to prepare a ginger and salt soup to induce vomiting; for wind-cold symptoms, use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi powder, and for qi stagnation, use Ba Wei Shun Qi powder. After vomiting, if there are no other symptoms, simply adjust with herbs like Cang Zhu, Bai Zhu, Chen Pi, Hou Po, and Gan Cao. </p>
<p>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment by Wang Kentang, Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>General Overview<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Luo Quanshan said: The Grand Guardian Wang stated that &quot;jue&quot; refers to a reversal of qi. In modern times, it is mistakenly referred to as &quot;foot disease,&quot; but upon reading this, one realizes that in ancient times, it was called foot disease. The texts say: In cold jue, the hands and feet are cold; in hot jue, the hands and feet are hot. In wei jue, there is a combination of atrophy and jue, leading to weak and powerless feet. In bi jue, there is a combination of bi illness and jue illness, resulting in stubborn numbness, swelling, and pain in the feet. Qi rebelling can be seen in prior cases of cold jue, hot jue, wei jue, bi jue, and wind jue, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, confusion, bloating, shortness of breath, numbness in the lower abdomen, or sudden loss of consciousness, which the world refers to as foot disease attacking the heart. Nowadays, people also consider sudden fainting and loss of consciousness as jue. When asked how to interpret cold hands and feet as jue, it is said, &quot;It is not.&quot; In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s discussion of typhoid fever, a hot jue is indicated by hot hands and feet, and a cold jue by cold hands and feet, with cold being referred to as reversing. It is stated that any jue occurs when yin and yang do not harmoniously connect. Jue is characterized by the hands and feet being reversely cold. Therefore, in cases of yang deficiency that do not connect, one warms it; in cases where yang is trapped and deeply hidden, not harmonizing with yin, one purges it; where pathogenic heat invades but has not deeply penetrated, one disperses the transmitted yin heat, adjusting treatment according to the depth and severity. This pertains to the pathogenic factor of typhoid fever entering the interior, where the rebellious jue of the great yin hands and feet corresponds only to the two channels. Since it is a discussion of the pathogenic element transmitted through the six channels of typhoid, it is known that jue yin is the channel where the two yins intersect. When heat transmits to this location, it has reached an extreme depth, which is why it is called jue yin.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>The discourse in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; on this topic is different. It states that the three yang channels originate from the surface of the five toes, while the three yin channels emerge from the inner sides of the same toes. Therefore, when the yang energy is abundant, the lower body becomes warm; when the yin energy prevails, cold rises from the toes to the knees. Regarding the cause of cold syndromes, it is said that the &quot;front yin&quot; is where the tendons gather, and it unites the taiyin and yangming channels. This occurs when a person is robust, during the autumn and winter when yin energy is strong and yang energy weakens. This results in an imbalance; the energy is depleted, and the flowing upwards is resisted, leading to an overflow of essence downward. Pathogenic energies ascend as a consequence, and the waning yang cannot nourish the meridians. As a result, yang diminishes each day while yin remains dominant, causing the hands and feet to feel cold.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>In discussing the causes of heat stroke, it is said that a person must often become drunk. If one indulges while full, the qi accumulates in the spleen, the kidney qi gradually declines, and the yang qi predominates, resulting in heat in the hands and feet. Observing its subtle essence, it likely relates to the kidneys receiving the essence of prenatal vitality, from which the original qi is filled, resulting in the interdependence of the two organs and the flow of the vessels. The operation of yin and yang within and without occurs, each with its own duties; yang governs the warming of the exterior, while yin governs the cooling of the interior. The vessels connect and circulate through the limbs; hence, I cite the example of the spleen and stomach being harmed by alcohol and lust, leading to severe cases of yin and yang disorders at the beginning of the text. Continuing to discuss the twelve channels of reversal, one only addresses the reversal of qi in the primary channels without mentioning the heat in the hands and feet or the reasons for the sickness; these cannot be fully explained in a single statement. Having established the two examples above, one can extend the inference to these matters, therefore it is not necessary to repeat them. Nevertheless, I will provide detailed exposition on other sections related to syncope to clarify the matter.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>According to the discussion on the Taiyin and Yangming: The Yangming involves the five organs and six bowels drawing vital energy from the stomach. Now, if the spleen is diseased and cannot assist the stomach in moving its fluids to the three Yin, the stomach likewise cannot transport fluids to the three Yang. Consequently, the limbs fail to receive the vital energy from food and grain, leading to progressive decline. The menstrual flow becomes unbeneficial, and the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the energy to thrive. In this context, the spleen and stomach oscillate between fullness and emptiness, with one being deficient and unable to move fluids while the other is excessive and acts independently. This independent action inevitably causes cold, which is one cause of syncope from the spleen and stomach. Furthermore, all twelve meridians draw vital energy from the stomach. If the stomach is cold, the energy in the meridians becomes cold; if the stomach is hot, the energy in the meridians becomes hot. Thus, when the meridians are not harmonized, there will inevitably be residual cold or heat at the extremities. This is the second cause of syncope from the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Furthermore, the spleen and stomach are the organs that govern the kidneys. When the spleen and stomach are afflicted, they will impact the kidneys, where the kidneys regulate the lower body, especially in cases of syncope. If the kidneys are affected by pathogens, syncope occurs; this is the third cause of syncope related to the spleen and stomach. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: the Chong vessel, which shares its origin with the Shaoyin and the Great Luo from the kidneys, is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, thus all five organs and six bowels are nourished by it. The upper part of the Chong vessel nourishes Yang, and infuses essence; the lower part connects to the Shaoyin channel, moistens the three Yin, infuses the collaterals, and warms the muscles. If the collateral networks are blocked, the diaphragm becomes immobile; if it is immobile, syncope results, leading to coldness. The Chong vessel is responsible for the Yang that governs the internal functions of the kidneys; Yang is associated with fire. If this Yang moves properly, it is a minor fire that nourishes life; if it moves chaotically, it becomes a strong fire that harms, and excessive fire weakens the original true Yang. Dongyuan stated that fire and original Qi cannot coexist; when one prevails, the other is diminished. As previously discussed regarding syncope, when the Qi is downward and conflicts arise upwards, the pathogenic Qi follows, not from a separate source, but from the chaos of this fire, causing the tumultuous energies of Yin and Yang to rise in rebellion.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said that the disease of the Chong Vessel arises from reversed qi, and the pathogenic mechanisms indicate that all reversed influences ascending are associated with fire, while all collapses are associated with the lower part. However, when the yin and yang of the kidneys are harmonized, treatments for the lower part are effective; if they are not harmonized, treatments for the lower part will fail, leading to the emergence of heat and cold collapses. This is the pathway of the kidneys concerning collapses. </p>
<p>As for the Chong Vessel and the stomach, both are named after the sea; hence, the diseases of collapse in the twelve vessels are all related. Additionally, other texts discussing collapses mention that excess yang qi can lead to an outburst, where essence is exhausted and accumulations form in summer, causing people to experience collapses. There are also conditions where two yangs and one yin cause wind collapse; cases where lack of determination leads to collapses; organ collapses; sudden and unrecognized collapses; and collapses where all five collaterals are exhausted. </p>
<p>All these causes, arising from reversed evils, involve the intertwining of fire and the five types of fire, leading to disruptions in the qi of the vessels, thus resulting from the interactions of the five qi: wind, cold, dryness, dampness, and heat.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>The five energies often transform and interact with one another. Wind and dryness transform together into heat; dampness and cold transform together into cold symptoms. When illness is severe, the limbs may be influenced by the cold and heat into a state of reversal. The rebellious qi that rises from below must rely on the fiery strength to achieve this. The San Jiao, foot Shao Yang, Chong, Ren, and Du meridians all govern the fire below, yet they all belong to the kidneys. Why is this? The foot Shao Yin and hand Shao Yin interact at midday, residing in between; this allows the kidney&#39;s original qi to be stabilized. If the ministerial fire is improperly activated, one must first support the kidneys and regulate the treatment to redirect the rebellious qi, differentiating the strengths of the five energies to adjust them appropriately. However, there are also cases where the body does not become cold due to the uprising of qi. As stated in &quot;The Original Patterns of Disease,&quot; yin water governs purity, thus if there is cold illness, the four limbs may feel cold. This indicates that yang is weak while yin is present, resulting in cold. This corresponds to the principle stated by Zhongjing that one experiences reversal before heat; due to the cold pathogen from the outside, the yang qi is unable to overcome it, hence the initial state of reversal. Though evils may be categorized as internal and external, in the context of warming, they are essentially singular.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>Blood Collapse</strong> </p>
<p>There are individuals who, without any previous illness, suddenly become lifeless, their bodies immobile and silent, unaware of others, with closed eyes that cannot open, and mouths that cannot speak. They may have a slight awareness of others but dislike hearing any sounds, feeling as though in a daze, only regaining consciousness after a while. This condition is caused by excessive sweating, leading to a deficiency of blood and qi being stagnant in the blood, with yang rising but not descending. Qi becomes blocked and fails to circulate, resulting in a death-like state. When qi returns to the blood and yin and yang are restored, consciousness returns after some time. This is called &quot;stagnation collapse,&quot; also known as &quot;blood collapse.&quot; It is often found in women. The treatment should be Baiwei Decoction or Cangong Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Various Types of Collapse</strong> </p>
<p>Collapse is not a fixed illness. Yang collapse supplements yin, nourishing the master of water; yin collapse supplements yang, enhancing the source of fire. These forms of yin and yang collapse differ from the yin and yang collapses associated with cold damage. In cases of cold damage, yang collapse requires the method of pushing out the old to bring in the new, while yin collapse requires the use of Fuzi to regulate the center. The differences are as pronounced as between ice and fire, with life and death within reach.</p>
<p>When yang qi is weak and deficient, yin must compensate, causing cold to travel from the fingers to the knees, known as cold collapse. This is an inversion of cold downward, treated with Liuwu Fuzi Decoction. When yin retreats, yang advances; therefore, when yin qi weakens below, yang moves to replenish it, resulting in warmth in the feet. When the heat intensifies, it may ascend along the three yin pathways, termed heat collapse, which should be treated with Liuw Wei Di Huang Pill. The liver stores blood and governs anger; thus, when anger arises, fire ascends in the liver, carrying blood upward, resulting in chaotic blood and qi within the chest, leading to a reversal and termed thin collapse, which should be treated with Puhuang Decoction.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>All movements belong to Yang; thus, when one is overworked, it disturbs the Yang, causing the Yang energy to expand. When the Yang energy expands, the fire of labor becomes excessive. Excessive fire causes water to dry up, leading to exhaustion of essence. This results in prolonged accumulation, and by summer, both internal and external heat increase, further depleting water and increasing fire. The solitary Yang becomes reversed, as if simmering or boiling; thus, it is called &quot;simmering reversal,&quot; for which Ren Shen Gu Ben Wan is recommended.</p>
<p>The Qi of the five corpses, through excessive indulgence, disrupts the balance of Yin and Yang, affecting Qi and blood. Above there is the obstruction of absolute Yang, and below there is the severing of Yin connections, causing disconnection of form and Qi. This leads to a violent reversal resembling death, named &quot;corpse reversal,&quot; for which Er Shi Si Wei Liu Qi Yin and Su He Xiang Wan are recommended.</p>
<p>Cold phlegm leads to confusion, with the extremities feeling cold; this is termed &quot;phlegm reversal,&quot; for which Jiang Fu Tang is recommended. Stomach cold may cause the expulsion of roundworms, known as &quot;roundworm reversal,&quot; for which Wu Mei San with Li Zhong Tang is recommended.</p>
<p>Qi is the Yang of the human body; any stagnation leads to the inability of Yang Qi to circulate, resulting in coldness of the hands and feet, resembling a stroke. However, in a stroke, the body tends to be warm, and in Qi reversal, the body is cold. This is termed &quot;Qi reversal,&quot; for which Ba Wei Shun Qi San is recommended.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Classics</strong></p>
<p>In the section detailing pulse diagnosis, it is stated that &quot;厥&quot; refers to the internal depletion, meaning the loss of the essence and vital energy of the five internal organs. &quot;喑&quot; indicates an inability to produce sound. &quot;俳&quot; refers to the body&#39;s limbs being impaired. Nowadays, when people encounter these symptoms, they will likely label them as stroke without realizing it results from internal depletion and kidney deficiency. This is because sound originates from the lungs and fundamentally relies on the kidneys, while physical strength is rooted in blood and fundamentally depends on essence. The foundation of vital energy primarily lies in the kidneys; thus, when the lesser yin is insufficient, it results in &quot;厥.&quot; Furthermore, the essay on regulating the meridians states that a deficiency of will leads to &quot;厥.&quot; The section on the spirit indicates that a deficiency in kidney energy leads to &quot;厥.&quot; Observing these discussions, it is clear that the essence of &quot;厥&quot; is not related to wind. Therefore, for treating this condition, one should emphasize methods that are not based on wind symptoms. The essay on regulating the meridians indicates that both energy and blood can be deficient, revealing an imbalance of yin and yang. If both energy and blood travel upwards, it indicates a deficiency of yin below and a lack of root in the spirit, resulting in the separation of yin and yang, which may cause sudden death. If the condition is slight, recovery can be achieved; if it is severe, the situation is critical.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>This is precisely what people today refer to as an abrupt fall or collapse due to a stroke, which is also a stroke caused by phlegm-heat obstructing the upper body, while failing to realize that it actually stems from a deficiency in the lower body. However, the condition of the upper body being &#39;full&#39; is only a false fullness, and in severe cases, it should be slightly cleared. The deficiency in the lower body is a true emptiness; if there are no pathogenic factors to address, then one must promptly strengthen the lower body decisively. </p>
<p>In observing the passages of the Yangming classic regarding the linking of channels and organs, it is stated that &#39;reversal of qi&#39; is significant, which is quite evident and straightforward! The linking of channels indicates that the illness lies in the muscles, hence it is light and produces symptoms; whereas, the linking of organs indicates that the illness lies at the root, thus it is heavy and fatal. Having recognized this as a reversal of qi, it can be discerned that symptoms like abrupt falls and collapses are not truly strokes, but various scholars in Hejian refer to the central organs, which leads to confusion between true and false strokes, making it difficult to distinguish. </p>
<p>The detailed discussions in the Great Righteousness Treatise and the Subtle Analysis Treatise state: &quot;When the pulse reaches a state resembling panting, it indicates a pulse that is rapid and urgent like breathlessness, reflecting a condition of chaotic blood and qi, hence resulting in sudden reversal and inability to speak,&quot; which aligns with what people today refer to as a &#39;silent stroke.&#39;<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>In Yunyang, the upper part is hot and the lower part is cold; this indicates a condition where water and fire do not interact, leading to a state of blindness, akin to dizziness caused by wind. Those who cannot speak are suffering issues related to the lungs and kidneys, while those who are dizzy have problems linked to the liver and spleen. For those who temporarily regain consciousness, recovery can occur when the Qi returns; however, if the Yin deteriorates, it is a very dangerous condition. All should be treated according to the previous principles to address the root cause.</p>
<p>In the discussion of the &quot;End and Beginning&quot; chapter, it states: sudden clarity refers to sudden coldness; if it feels like being split or severed, it is described as painful and indescribable, which aligns with the so-called confusion and disturbance caused by wind. Those with heat often experience warmth and a strong pulse, thus it is advisable to clear the fire within the Yin. Those with phlegm often suffer from wheezing and have a slippery pulse, thus it is necessary to relieve the phlegm in the upper jiao. For those without fire or phlegm, they tend to feel cold and have a weak pulse, hence it is necessary to tonify the primordial Qi. In cases with such symptoms coupled with confusion and loss of consciousness, this represents a severe condition involving multiple organs, often difficult to treat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Connecting Qi to the Heavens&quot; chapter explains that convulsions due to heat are a type of heat stroke, caused by overexertion accumulating during summer, which can now be referred to as heat wind.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>If one sees a person suddenly collapse with convulsions and phlegm, they should immediately treat them using methods for heat stroke. &quot;Thin prickle&quot; refers to a situation of acute pressure caused by great anger, leading to conditions such as qi and blood stasis; the treatment approach should be as follows. </p>
<p>According to the detailed analysis of deficiencies and excesses, diseases caused by rich foods and liquors harm the spleen and kidneys; diseases arising from sudden worries are related to the sadness that harms the lungs; internal qi being violently depleted relates to anger affecting the liver. All these are considered internal injuries. If there is an external wind causing harm rather than internal issues, it will certainly affect the meridians, leading to symptoms of emaciation and painful obstruction. Thus, the distinction between internal injuries and external attacks can be understood and should not be confused.</p>
<p>In detail regarding the principles of reversal and order about fat and thin, the pathways run from the head down to the feet, from the back to the abdomen. All organs and meridians, including the five zang organs, six fu organs, and twelve meridians, are interconnected; thus, they are referred to as the sea of the five zang, six fu, and twelve meridians. The sea is the source of all rivers; hence, wherever the meridians originate, there is a sense of convergence. This understanding applies to the ebb and flow of blood and qi throughout the body.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The Chong Vessel originates in the womb, which is where its meridians converge and where vital energies accumulate. Hence, it is referred to as the Sea of Blood or the Gate of Life; this is what is called the fundamental abode. If one indulges in passions, leading to the depletion of the source of essence and energy, conditions such as syncope and sudden collapse will arise from this. Otherwise, how is it that one can suddenly fall, with both spirit and body in decline, utterly oblivious to surroundings? When it reaches this point, is it merely a disease of a single meridian or organ? Upon examination, it becomes clear that it is indeed due to the collapse of the Chong Vessel, without a doubt. Therefore, anyone who treats this by seeking relief without addressing the root cause, it is certain that such reasoning is flawed! Specifically regarding the discussion of the condition of shock from external evil influence, it is associated with sudden onset of malign conditions. This includes all forms of improper energies across the four seasons, as well as mountain spirits and soil demons, along with all sorts of phantoms and nightmares.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>When someone suffers from this condition, their hands and feet suddenly become cold, their skin shivers, their complexion turns dark and pale, and their spirit is unsettled. They may speak nonsensically or be unable to speak, with phlegm obstructing their throat. They might also experience dizziness and lose consciousness; this is referred to as &quot;corpse syncope&quot; or &quot;sudden syncope.&quot; Acupuncture should be employed, as detailed in the classic texts. If moxibustion is used, the methods of Qin Chengzu and Hua Tuo for moxibustion on the yang are particularly effective. </p>
<p>In all medicinal practices, one must understand that the presence of evils is due to qi deficiency; therefore, in the classic texts, it is mentioned to use blood from the left side to replenish the Five Meridians that are depleted, which is clear in meaning. In such dangerous moments, without employing herbs like ginseng and Aconite to restore yang, how can one recover? If the evil qi is overwhelming and the chest is obstructed, one must first clear the passages before regulating. One should primarily use formulas like Jin Zheng Qi San, Liu Qi Yin, green onion and ginger soup, or Su He Wan.</p>
<p>A discussion on the strength and weakness of formulas concludes that counteracting the path of qi is the same as syncope. The interplay of yin and yang qi is such that yang rises from the left and yin descends from the right; therefore, for yang illnesses, the left side is more severe, and for yin illnesses, the right side is more severe. When the rising does not rise and the descending does not descend, it is the reversal of the natural flow of qi.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>The vitality of a person must ascend from below; therefore, the energy of the elderly has declined from below, and what arises from above is in accordance with nature. In contrast, the vitality of youth is initially strong from below, and what rises from below is in accordance with nature. If an old person’s spirit declines from above, the energy at their end is predictable; when the young person’s body weakens from below, the energy at their beginning is predictable as well, both are cases of reversal. When one becomes ill and cannot rise or fall, it indicates that their foundation has deteriorated, hence the cold and extremities reach to the knees. The youth, with their yang energy still vigorous, face decomposition during autumn and winter; the elderly, with their yang energy inherently diminished and more sensitive to cold, therefore have no worries in autumn and winter. All these diseases of inversion, where yang appears not to be yang and yin seems not to be yin, create a separation of the five organs, leaving no evidence to verify. If one cannot complete their days, it signifies their serious decline. Furthermore, in dreams where one is utterly confused and disoriented, this results from the heart and kidneys not communicating, causing the spirit to scatter and stray, thus leading to inversion. Such conditions are fundamentally linked to the roots of the lesser yin.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The discussion of cold and hot collapse (jue) involves the hands and feet as terms, but essentially speaks to the disorder of yin and yang. Cold collapse represents a loss due to usage, while hot collapse arises from excessive drinking. This is because the energies of yin and yang invariably manifest in the hands and feet; thus, when collapse is about to occur, cold and heat numbness must first emerge from the hands and feet. When it becomes severe, it may manifest in various ways, potentially affecting the five organs and six bowels, each presenting its own symptoms. Therefore, the collapse of the hands and feet serves primarily as a visible sign, and by recognizing slight indications, one should consider the underlying causes.</p>
<p>Examining Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s views on reverse collapse, there are notable differences from the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; discussions concerning the hands and feet distinguish between cold and hot collapse, whereas Zhang Zhongjing focuses solely on the aspect of cold reversal as a form of collapse. Furthermore, concerning the discussion of evil and righteous energies, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; addresses the original qi, hence the manifold symptoms, encompassing both qi and blood, which all bear critical signs; in contrast, Zhang Zhongjing emphasizes the role of evil qi, considering the hands and feet only, with fears directed towards the descent of yin and the retreat of yang. Cheng Wujide states: collapse signifies the predominance of yin, which is understandable.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p>
<h3>Argument</h3>
<p>The signs of reversal (or counterflow) are those of danger. The term &#39;reversal&#39; signifies a complete disruption or chaos, representing the disorder of qi and blood. This is why the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; places special emphasis on it and explains it in detail. It states that sudden and violent reversals are both general names for this condition. For instance, terms like cold reversal and hot reversal differentiate the yin and yang aspects of the condition. When mentioning connected channels and organs, it discusses the life and death aspects of reversal. Moreover, the distinctions among the various channels and organs have also been elaborated upon.</p>
<p>Additionally, in recent times, there are still signs such as qi reversal, blood reversal, phlegm reversal, alcohol reversal, and ascaris reversal, all of which are fundamentally based on these principles. Observing the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; they appear to be quite clear; however, later generations still fail to recognize this. Whenever they encounter these signs, they tend to label them all as a stroke, unaware of what reversal truly signifies, thus treating them as wind disorders, which can lead to greater harm. I am deeply saddened by this, which is why I have made efforts to clarify previous misinterpretations of wind conditions.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of these conditions, it should be approached as treating the previous non-wind signs, using them in conjunction. This is precisely how one should address reversal. Any remaining similar signs will still be listed in subsequent sections.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>In cases of cold extremities, the limbs must be cool, with a pulse that is deep, faint, and infrequent; or, even if frequent, it is weak. The patient may fear cold and prefer warmth, covering themselves with clothing, or may experience diarrhea of clear fluids, and the physical symptoms are generally weak. Although these cases all pertain to cold syndromes, there are many conditions that resemble heat but are not actually heat-related. Therefore, whenever there is cold extremity with pulse and symptoms not indicative of real heat, it is certainly cold extremity without doubt. </p>
<p>Hot extremities must first show numerous heat-related symptoms, with a pulse that is deep, slippery, and rapid; the patient fears heat and prefers coolness, may wave their hands and kick their feet, or feel restless, with constipation and dark stools, and the physical symptoms are often marked by confusion or stupor. </p>
<p>When treating these two conditions, one should apply methods distinct from treating cold and heat conditions associated with wind. As for the case of cold extremities resulting from cold damage, both its yin and yang aspects should be discerned using this method. However, in cases of cold extremities due to cold damage, the distinction lies in the pathogenic qi, hence cold extremities should be treated with warming methods, while hot extremities should be addressed with purging methods.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>In the &quot;Neijing,&quot; the essential focus is on the primordial qi. Therefore, for heat syncope, one must supplement yin, and for cold syncope, one must supplement yang. The treatment of both cases cannot be overlooked!</p>
<p>The symptoms of qi syncope are of two types, as both qi deficiency and qi excess can lead to syncope. In cases of sudden collapse due to qi deficiency, the body will appear weak, the color will be pale, the limbs will feel slightly cold, and the pulse will be weak—this indicates a loss of qi. One should use remedies such as ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, rehmannia, goji berries, or great rejuvenation decoctions; in severe cases, remedies like Huayan Decoction or Ginseng Decoction should be used.</p>
<p>In cases of syncope due to qi excess, the body will appear agitated, the pulse will be deep, taut, and slippery, and there will be fullness in the chest and diaphragm—this indicates a reversal of qi. In cases of great anger, the body and qi may collapse, leading to blood pooling above; this is related. Treatment should include dispersing Qi Decoction, Four Molar Decoction, Eight Flavors Tranquilizing Powder, or Su He Xiang Pill to first normalize the qi, then subsequently regulate according to the condition of deficiency or excess.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>If one becomes angry and harms the qi, causing it to be reversed and thus impairing the true qi, it indicates that the qi was initially weak. If one is prone to much anxiety and fear, leading to a timid and trapped qi, this weakness becomes even more apparent. If one uses methods meant to regulate the qi and resolve stagnation in such cases, it would be a mistake. </p>
<p>There are two types of blood stasis: one caused by blood loss and the other by blood reversal, both of which can lead to stasis. Blood loss occurs in cases of severe bleeding or excessive blood loss during childbirth, leading to a loss of qi as well, hence causing sudden collapse and death. In such cases, one should first pinch the philtrum or burn vinegar with charcoal to gather the qi, and urgently administer one or two taels of ginseng decoction to restore the qi, ensuring it does not completely escape; this will lead to gradual recovery. Then, according to the conditions of cold or heat, one may proceed to regulate it accordingly; this is called replenishing the qi after blood loss. </p>
<p>If one does not understand this and merely uses medicines for the blood, even a small amount of qi could suddenly dissipate, leaving the yin with nothing to support it, and thus there would be no vitality. If one considers using cold and cooling methods to stop the bleeding, it will certainly damage the yang qi, hastening death.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>Blood reversal refers to the phenomenon where blood and qi move together upwards, and it is also described as a condition where intense anger causes the manifestation of qi to be disrupted, leading to blood accumulating above. When blood is affected by reverse qi, it is essential to first regulate the qi; when qi flows smoothly, blood will follow suit. It is advisable to use formulas like Tongyu Decoction or Huagan Decoction to address this condition and, once blood circulation is restored and qi is relaxed, to treat according to the specific symptoms.</p>
<p>When phlegm and fluids obstruct the body, causing qi to become stagnant and mental confusion, and neither medication nor food can alleviate it, one must prioritize either inducing vomiting or relieving the blockage to address the urgent condition. Once the phlegm and qi have opened slightly, one should then treat the root cause of the illness. If phlegm is caused by heat, it should be cleared and driven down; if caused by wind and cold, it should be dispersed and warmed; if caused by dampness, it should be dried and regulated; if caused by spleen deficiency, the spleen should be strengthened; if caused by kidney deficiency, the kidneys should be nourished. Treating the underlying causes will allow the phlegm to clear naturally. However, there are cases where phlegm cannot be treated directly, as pushing too hard may worsen the condition and exacerbate the phlegm.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>Various methods for treating phlegm can be found in the previous section regarding the treatment of phlegm not caused by wind. The symptoms of &quot;alcoholic syncope&quot; correspond to those described as &quot;heat syncope&quot; in the classics. Furthermore, the classic also mentions &quot;alcohol wind,&quot; which belongs to this category. Those who indulge in drinking without restraint often suffer from this illness. When their vital energy is strong and can overcome it, they do not recognize the harm of alcohol; but when they begin to weaken, the effects of alcohol become frightening. There are many ailments caused by alcohol, and their origins are unknown. When it comes to alcoholic syncope, it closely resembles a stroke: in mild cases, the person may still be aware, but in severe cases, they may suddenly collapse, become unresponsive, or exhibit sudden confusion, agitation, inability to speak, excessive phlegm, breathlessness, fever, cough, or even spitting blood. If one observes that the stools are dry and the pulse is strong and prefers cold, this indicates excess heat and dampness obstructing upward, and it is advisable to use methods like extracting the fuel (removing the underlying cause) and drinking to swiftly cool the fire.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>In cases of extreme heat, one should alternate with drinks made from pear syrup and mung bean to counteract the poison. It is crucial to avoid items that are spicy and dry, to gradually reduce damp heat and restore some energy, and only then use nourishing yin remedies for subsequent care. If there is constipation or a weak pulse without signs of heat, one should not clear heat but instead use remedies like Erchen Decoction, Liu Junzi Decoction, or Jinshui Liujun Decoction.</p>
<p>If due to alcohol, the yin is harmed leading to the dual deficiency of spleen and kidney, and this results in syncope, one must promptly address the root cause; otherwise, there will be no benefit. Anyone suffering from this should avoid alcohol for life, ensuring they do not let it touch their lips; ignorance of this will make relapse very difficult.</p>
<p>There are two types of symptoms of color loss: one is sudden collapse, and the other is blood movement. The sudden collapse of color is typically due to the person being fundamentally deficient, occasionally exerting themselves to the fullest in unusual circumstances; or it may occur after a prolonged indulgence in love and desire. Therefore, after such incidents, Qi departs along with essence, resulting in a sudden collapse that cannot be reversed.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>One should urgently press the Ren Zhong point, and have the individual embrace tightly, facing each other, ensuring that warm breath circulates between them to connect their vital energy, and not allow the energy to escape, in order to preserve the spirit. Then, quickly administer Duhua Decoction or apply strong moxibustion to the Qihai point several times to restore the Yang energy, which might help revive them. However, due to the urgency of the situation, how can one be meticulous in treatment? Thus, it often results in failure to save them. This discussion is specifically about those who are in immediate distress, and indeed, such cases are not many. Yet, there are many who suffer from latent conditions. How do I know this? Because their essence diminishes over time, and their vital energy gradually depletes. Therefore, symptoms often appear two or three days after engaging in sexual activity. But since the problem does not manifest immediately, it is not viewed as an illness. Moreover, many people are reluctant to talk about this, unaware that after middle age, many fall ill because of it; this is what is referred to as &quot;color and syncope.&quot; Unfortunately, the practitioners of the time cannot discern this and simply attribute it to strokes.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>For those treating this condition, one should primarily focus on nourishing and supporting the Mingmen (life gate), whether using water or fire, and the treatment should be based on methods for addressing the &quot;non-wind gate.&quot; </p>
<p>Moreover, the movement of blood characterized by color changes occurs because both blood and qi rush upward, which is also categorized as blood congestion. However, this is different from blood reversing due to intense anger, and thus, the treatment methods also vary. This condition often arises from the upward blazing of the desire fire, causing the blood to follow the qi upward. It typically involves strong emotional disturbances and the inability to express desires, and sometimes it involves using curative herbs to strongly suppress the excessive fire. </p>
<p>Symptoms may include sudden and violent vomiting, nosebleeds that cannot be controlled, cold reversals, sweating, shortness of breath, or coughing—all of which result from the upward surge of yin fire. </p>
<p>In treating this, one must first suppress the fire to control its momentum, clear the fullness, and transform excessive dampness, primarily using Four Yin Decoction or modified versions of similar prescriptions. If there is depletion of yin below and fire does not return to its source, with no other troubling heat pulse signs, and continuous blood congestion leading to a critical state, it is essential to use Zhen Yin Decoction, as it alone can provide rescue. Once the condition stabilizes, one can then adjust treatment according to the specific symptoms.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Yin and Yang Syndromes</p>
<p>There are two types of syndromes: Yang syndrome and Yin syndrome. Yang syndrome, or heat syndrome, occurs when heat travels from the three Yang channels into the Yin system. It initially manifests as headache and fever, starting shallow and progressing deeper, eventually affecting the three Yin channels, leading to coldness in the limbs and sometimes warmth. The symptoms include constipation, restlessness, delirium, thirst, aversion to heat rather than cold, and a deep, strong pulse. This is caused by the transformation of heat in the channels; externally, the hands and feet may feel cold, but internally it is due to a pathogenic heat. When Yang syndrome manifests, it resembles Yin, hence it is called Yang syndrome. The symptoms arise from internal heat or loss of Yang at its descending point. If the syndrome is mild, the heat is also mild, and remedies like Si Ni San are appropriate; if severe, then stronger remedies like Cheng Qi Decoction are needed. </p>
<p>Yin syndrome, or cold syndrome, does not initially show signs of heat from the three Yang channels. Instead, true cold directly invades the three Yin channels, causing aversion to cold, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, shivering, and a lack of thirst, with a deep, weak pulse. This syndrome is characterized by the absence of Yang, thus it is called Yin syndrome. For mild cases, Li Zhong Decoction is suitable, while for severe cases, Si Ni Decoction or Hui Yang Decoction are recommended. </p>
<p>Note that the differentiation between Yang and Yin syndromes is as described; this is a fundamental principle of the ancients. However, I humbly offer my distinctions.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>In cases of Yin inversion, where there are no Yang symptoms or Yang pulse but the illness manifests as cold, it is clearly a Yin condition. Nowadays, people simply call it middle cold, which is indeed the disease. However, few fall into this error, and it&#39;s not difficult to understand. The treatment should be to warm the center without needing further distinction. </p>
<p>As for Yang inversion, distinguishing it is necessary. Inversion arises from the transmission of the three Yangs, leading to Yang inversion, which is indeed the case. Even in discussing transmission through the channels, can it be said that there are no Yin conditions? Therefore, any illness resulting from true Yang deficiency is also a Yin inversion within Yang; a weak pulse with no spirit is also a Yin inversion within Yang; excessive attack or cooling leads to a Yin inversion within Yang as well. </p>
<p>The four limbs are the roots of all Yang; unless there are symptoms like heat accumulation, restlessness, thirst, or fullness, inverted coldness indicates a deficiency of Yang energy. Cheng Wujie stated: generally, inversion is related to Yin, and is often associated with coldness. He also said: inversion is the amplification of Yin. Therefore, conditions of combined deficiency and coldness, although they may arise from the Yang channels, are still a Yin inversion within Yang. </p>
<p>Should Yin within Yin be warmed, or should Yin within Yang be cooled? Scholars should not think that the presence of headache and fever, merely due to the transmission of the three Yangs, automatically classifies it as Yang inversion, as treating cold caused by heat would lead to significant harm.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>Hui Jue (Intestinal Twists)</p>
<p>Cheng Wujiy stated: &quot;Zang Jue (Organ Collapse) leads to death, as the yang energy is severed. Although Hui Jue involves convulsions and distress, once the gut contents are expelled, the person will calm down. However, this is not preferable to Zang Jue, which is accompanied by restlessness, with no moment of peace. The patient suffers from cold organs and a weak stomach, thus it is advisable to administer Wumei Wan to warm the organs and stabilize the worms. Both Zang Jue and Hui Jue are related to febrile diseases, as detailed in the section on Febrile Diseases.&quot;<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Secret Record of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><em>By Qing Dynasty Chen Shiduo</em></p>
<p>The treatment method for the condition involves understanding that when one experiences sudden coldness and pain in the limbs, it is often mistaken for a wind-related issue of the extremities. In reality, it is the internal heat of the heart that cannot be released, leading to cold limbs while the chest and abdomen feel hot. The prescription consists of three qian of Chai Hu, two qian of Dang Gui, one qian of Jing Jie, two qian of Huang Lian, two qian of stir-fried Zhi Zi, one qian of Ban Xia, and one qian of Zhi Ke, which should be decocted in water. One dose will stabilize the condition, while two doses will lead to complete recovery. This is because many cases of cold limbs are due to internal fire, and intense coldness corresponds to intense heat. Thus, by relieving internal heat, the limbs will warm up. The brilliance of this formula lies in using Chai Hu as the chief ingredient, which, along with other cooling herbs, directly enters the heart and liver without causing stagnation in the chest. Chai Hu is adept at dispersing external and internal evils, and is effective in alleviating pent-up energy. Merely treating the limbs without addressing the core issue would be like capturing the underlings without catching the leader; the remaining forces would remain uncontained. Therefore, the focus should not be solely on the limbs but primarily on the heart and chest.</p>
<p>While many cases of this condition are indeed caused by internal heat, there are also instances of coldness that lead to the same symptoms, resulting from chilled Yin entering the kidney palace. This will inevitably challenge the heart&#39;s fire with the kidney&#39;s cold water being on the rise, leading to a weakened ruling fire while the subordinate becomes strong. If one does not urgently use strong heating remedies to save the heart, a crisis could ensue at any moment.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>To treat, use three qian of ginseng, one liang of white atractylodes, one qian each of aconite, cinnamon, and evodia. Boil with water and take as a decoction; one dose will cure. However, it is crucial to distinguish between cold and heat patterns, as they are vastly different. In cold qi deficiency, the hands and feet will be blue, drinking water will induce vomiting, and there will be abdominal pain, with a preference for warmth for relief. In contrast, with heat qi deficiency, the hands and feet may feel cold but will not appear bluish; water will not induce vomiting, and warmth will exacerbate abdominal pain. If one can accurately diagnose and appropriately use medicine, the treatment will be effective as soon as it reaches the throat—this is the mark of a true healer, and there is no need for talismans or incantations.</p>
<p>For treatment, if it is a case of corpse pattern due to evil qi blockage, medication must be used to open it. Do not use the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting; instead, use soapberry to provoke sneezing. Use seven gourd stems, and prepare with two bowls of water, reducing it to one bowl of decoction, adding a little salt to administer, which will induce a heavy cough with thick phlegm, resulting in cure. Alternatively, grind soapberry spines into fine powder, fill a goose feather quill with the powder, and blow it into the patient&#39;s nose. If they sneeze and expel thick phlegm resembling yellow substances, they will be cured. Most cases of qi deficiency are due to heat evil, yet the heat evil must manifest in cries; now, silently and lifelessly, resembling a corpse, it is clear this is a case of yin deficiency suddenly struck by yin evil. Therefore, do not treat a yang deficiency with methods meant for it, as this could lead to failure. It is better to first use gourd stem and soapberry to induce vomiting to remove phlegm. Once the voice returns, treat with five qian of ginseng, one qian of white peony, three qian of poria, five qian of white atractylodes, and two qian of pinellia to restore stability.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>This is indeed a method for opening treatment. The method for inducing sneezing is to grind three qian of fresh Pinellia into a powder, form it into water balls the size of yellow beans, and insert them into the nostrils; it will surely induce persistent sneezing. Drink water, and it will stop immediately. This method treats conditions like wind stroke, speechlessness, and corpse-like stupor, as well as demonic possession; all are excellent methods for opening treatment.</p>
<p>The method of guiding treatment is as follows: if someone suffers from symptoms of reversal due to a stroke and is afraid to use medicine for treatment, take one liang of Wu zhu yu and grind it into a powder, mix it with half a liang of flour, and add water to form a thick paste. Spread it onto a cloth about the size of a bell, forming a thick paper about half a fen thick, and apply it to the Yongquan acupoint. This will keep the hands and feet from reversing. This method can also be used to treat symptoms of upper heat and lower cold; it is a method for guiding fire back to its source as well.</p>
<p>For immediate treatment, one must not lie down or sit while administering the treatment. In cases where there is often reversal of the hands and feet, it is essential to stand and take the medicine, as it will stabilize instantly. This is because the symptoms of reversal originally stem from a heat disease; the deeper the heat, the more profound the reversal. If one lies down while taking the medicine, the medicine reaches the stomach, and upon encountering boiling fire qi, it will surge and not be absorbed, leading to vomiting. However, if one stands while taking the medicine, there will be no worry of vomiting. The prescription includes three qian each of Huang lian, Fu ling, and Bai shao, and one qian each of Chai hu, Bai jie zi, Mu guo, and Gan cao, to be boiled and taken.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>This formula is purely for calming the liver, eliminating heat while also harmonizing the nature of heat, making it suitable for ingestion without causing any regurgitation. However, when heat rises, vomiting can often occur. Patients should be held upright, and one person should administer the medicine and drink, allowing it to stay in the mouth for a while before laying them down, so that the medicine can act smoothly without the distress of vomiting. </p>
<p>Some individuals may suddenly faint, unable to speak, with closed eyes and limp hands, making snoring sounds from their throats, with excessive phlegm and gas, leading to death within a day for some, or two or three days for others. This condition often troubles the spirit, but it is also due to excessive phlegm and gas. The treatment should thus focus primarily on eliminating phlegm, but simply attacking phlegm without opening the orifices is futile. The formula used is the Qiming Pill: five qian each of fresh Pinellia and ginseng, one liang of dodder seed, three fen of licorice, three qian of Poria, one qian each of soap pod and fresh ginger, and two qian of sweet flag, to be decocted in water and taken. </p>
<p>In this formula, both ginseng and Pinellia are used in equal amounts to provide both attacking and tonifying effects, making it easier to dissipate phlegm and restore qi. The use of dodder seed as the chief ingredient helps to restore vital energy and disperse pathogenic factors; the addition of soap pod, sweet flag, and Poria opens the orifices to clear the heart, naturally allowing the qi to return and the fainting to stabilize. If there are doubts about the fainting being due to heat, and cold medicines are lightly used, it will drive the vital energy away. Fresh Pinellia is used rather than processed to preserve its life force for rescue during critical moments; over-preparation leads to reduced efficacy, making it ineffective.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br><strong>Jue Men</strong></p>

<p>In the case of sudden death from corpse reversal, the pulse still moves; if faint whispers can be heard in the ears and eyes, and warmth is felt in the thighs, this is the sign.

Prepare medicinal balls the size of small beans from strong wine, and administer two of these down with white soup. After a moment, if taken again, they will revive.</p>
<p>Regarding acupuncture and moxibustion: </p>
<p>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: When the solar organ alone is affected, it leads to fainting and breathlessness due to excess yang and insufficient yin. Both the exterior and interior should be treated by purging from below. When the lesser yang organ is alone affected, it causes fainting gas. If there is sudden and severe pain, one should also purge from below. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: There is an affliction presenting with swelling, neck pain, chest fullness, and abdominal distension. What illness is this, and how does it occur? Qi Bo replied: This is called &quot;fainting reversal.&quot; The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: Moxibustion would lead to muteness, and stone treatment would lead to madness; it is necessary for the vital energy to be united for effective treatment.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qi Bo replied: When yang energy is excessively rising, it leads to an excess above; moxibustion directs the yang energy into the yin, causing muteness. Stone treatment depletes the yang energy, leading to madness. The treatment should be done once the energies converge to promote recovery.</p>
<p>When cold energy invades the five organs, it causes fainting and upward leakage, resulting in depletion of yin energy. If yang energy has not entered, it can lead to sudden pain and death without awareness, but if the energy reverses, recovery is possible. Cold energy invading the intestines and stomach causes upward reversal, leading to pain and vomiting.</p>
<p>Evil energy invades the pathways of the hands and feet, as well as the lesser yin, greater yin, and foot yangming channels. These five pathways all converge in the ear. When they are completely depleted, the body’s pulse moves while there is no awareness, resembling a corpse, which some refer to as &quot;corpse fainting.&quot;<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>Insert the needle into the inner side of the big toe, at the base of the nail, where it resembles a leek leaf. Then prick the center of the foot, followed by the nail on the middle finger, with one insertion each. Next, insert the needle into the inner side of the hand&#39;s big toe, and then into the center of the palm, specifically at the tip of the lesser yin (Shàoyīn) points, with one insertion each. After this, if there is no relief, use a bamboo tube to blow into both ears. Take a square inch of hair from the left temple and burn it, then drink a cup of fine wine. If unable to drink, pour it down the throat immediately.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states: For yin needling, the left and right sides should be punctured accordingly to treat cold syncope and moderate cold syncope, with attention paid to the lesser yin behind the ankle. To treat hot syncope, leave the needle in longer as it counters cold; for cold syncope, leave the needle in longer to counter heat. To needle for heat syncope, there should be two yin and one yang; for cold syncope, the pattern shifts to two yang and one yin.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>The so-called &quot;two yin&quot; refers to the two piercing yin; &quot;one yang&quot; refers to the one piercing yang. The divergence of the foot&#39;s lesser yang is called brightness, located five inches from the ankle, diverging to the jueyin and connecting to the foot&#39;s tarsus. When it is full, it leads to coldness; when it is deficient, it results in weakness and inability to rise from sitting, drawing from where it diverges.</p>
<p>Regarding the cold and heat in the bones, the disease finds no rest, with incessant sweating and teeth not yet decayed; one should draw from the foot&#39;s lesser yin at the connection of the yin thigh. If the teeth have decayed, it is hopeless and cannot be cured. The same applies to bone coldness.</p>
<p>For the condition of cold and blockage, the cold qi ascends to the abdomen; one should draw from the connections of yin and yang to observe the main ailment, to drain yang and tonify the yin channels. The artery at the side of the neck is called &quot;renying,&quot; corresponding to the foot&#39;s yangming, located in front of the inguinal ligament; behind it, it is associated with the hand&#39;s yangming, named &quot;futu.&quot; The next pulse is from the foot&#39;s lesser yang pulse.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The Heavenly Window is named for the primary channel; the next vessel, the Foot Shao Yang, is called the Heavenly Pillar; the artery under the armpit, the Arm Tai Yin, is named the Heavenly Mansion. </p>
<p>For heat syncope, treat with the Foot Tai Yin and Shao Yang, keeping both; for cold syncope, treat with the Foot Yang Ming and Shao Yin in the feet, also keeping both. </p>
<p>Syncope with reverse flow represents illness, manifesting as a violent chill in the feet, a feeling of the chest wanting to split, and the intestines feeling as if cut with a knife, causing vexation and inability to eat, with the pulse being thin and uneven. Warmth should be applied to the Foot Shao Yin, while clarity should be taken from the Foot Yang Ming. If the body is clear, supplement; if warm, drain. </p>
<p>With reverse flow accompanied by abdominal distension, intestinal gurgling, fullness in the chest that obstructs breathing, apply treatment to the lower chest and both sides. If coughing leads to movement in the hands, and pressure applied yields immediate relief, that’s a positive sign.</p>
<p>In cases of heat illness presenting with headaches, temporal pain, and aching eyes, if the pulse is throbbing with frequent nosebleeds, this is a heat illness. Treat with the third needle, observing for excess or deficiency. </p>
<p>For cold-heat hemorrhoids, marked by weight in the body and heat in the intestines, treat with the fourth needle... </p>
<p>When syncope causes pain extending to the spine and reaching the top of the head, with a heavy sensation in the head, and rounded eyes, and stiffness in the lumbar spine, treat the blood vessels of the popliteal fossa on the Foot Tai Yang. </p>
<p>Syncope presents with chest fullness and facial swelling, with lips appearing parched and speech becoming difficult, even to the point of muteness; treatment should focus on the Foot Yang Ming. </p>
<p>When the syncope energy travels to the throat, causing an inability to speak, with coldness in the hands and feet and difficulty in defecation, treatment should be directed at the Foot Shao Yin.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>When the limbs are cold and the abdomen makes a rumbling sound, there is much cold air; the abdomen is filled with gurgling sounds and it becomes difficult to urinate, involving the foot of the Taiyin. When limbs are weak and cold, with the four extremities bound, one must treat it accordingly, twice daily. If there is numbness, one will know within ten days that it has not ceased, and the illness will have stopped.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What does it mean to be reversed and disordered? Qi Bo replied: Clear qi is in the yin, turbid qi is in the yang; nourishing qi moves smoothly through the vessels, while protective qi moves in reverse, with clarity and turbidity interfering with each other. Disorder in the arms and legs results in the four extremities being cold; disorder in the head leads to reverse cold and a heavy head that causes dizziness and fainting. With the right method and a way to resolve it, understanding this path is a treasure for the body. </p>
<p>If there is qi in the head, it should be drawn from the Tian Zhu and Da Zhu points; if not understood, take the foot taiyang&#39;s Xingshu. If qi is in the arms and legs, first draw from the blood vessels, then from the Yangming and Shaoyang points. </p>
<p>When it is cold, the ground freezes and water turns to ice; human qi is within, the skin closes, pores become blocked, sweat does not emerge, blood and qi become strong, and the flesh is firm and hard. At such times, even good acupuncturists cannot alleviate the four extremities&#39; cold. When the blood vessels congeal and are firm, they cannot move freely; hence, one cannot soften them immediately. </p>
<p>Therefore, to treat cold, one must first warm the area, harmonizing the meridians. Adjusting the palms, armpits, feet, neck, and spine to restore balance; once the fire qi flows, the blood vessels will circulate. Then assess the condition of the pulse; those that are muddy and stagnant should be needled and leveled, while those that are firm and tight should be broken up and dispersed until the qi settles, which is known as resolving the blockage.</p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: A heavy head, closed eyes, cold sweat not flowing, indicate a need for the Tàodào master. If there is pressing pain between the shoulders and hips, cold sweat, and aversion to cold, the Po (soul) needs to be addressed.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>Shoulder pain, fullness in the chest and abdomen, sharp stiffness in the back; the spirit hall governs these symptoms. </p>
<p>Cold and heat, chill and convulsion, fullness in the jaws, and the承浆 (Chengjiang) governs these. </p>
<p>Cold convulsions and hot agitation of the heart, insufficient breath, dampness causing itching and abdominal pain, making it impossible to eat or drink; elbow cramping, fullness, dryness and thirst in the throat—these are governed by the fish mound (Yujian). </p>
<p>In cases of heat illness with no sweating and convulsion, cold hands and feet, explosive diarrhea, heart pain, and abdominal distention, especially severe heart pain—this is stomach heart pain, generally governed, along with hidden white (Yinbai). </p>
<p>Yang convulsion with cold and chills, hardness in the lower abdomen, headache, pain in the legs and abdomen, digestive discomfort, difficulty in urination, tendency to vomit—governed by the three miles (Sanli). </p>
<p>Convulsions and obstructed breathing with fullness, wind in the body, sweating yet feeling clear, pain in the hips and thighs causing inability to walk, and skin pain in the feet—governed by the tears weep (Linqi). </p>
<p>For four convulsions with hands and feet feeling tight, sustained tension, heated in reverse, leg pain, abdominal distention, skin pain, good at stretching, frequent yawning—discomfort with men, wooden sound, shivering cold, a pain that pulls from the throat outward, heat illness, lack of sweating, pain in the lower teeth, aversion to cold, rapid eyes, fullness and shortness of breath, chills, closed mouth with tension, lack of appetite—governed by the inner court (Neiting). </p>
<p>Foot convulsions with reverse breathing, cold feet up to the knees—governed by the springing source (Yongquan). </p>
<p>In cases of corpse convulsions, unable to recognize a person, pulse pulsating as usual, governed by hidden white (Yinbai) and great tun (Dazun). </p>
<p>In states of confusion with corpse convulsions and pain, governed by the center of extremes (Zhongji) and the seizing of the messenger (Puxin).<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>When a person dies suddenly, it is called &quot;corpse qi.&quot; </p>
<p>The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; states that for &quot;fu yang,&quot; it is responsible for atrophy and convulsions, with severe pain in the head due to wind. The &quot;Yixue Gangmu&quot; mentions that if the body is hot like fire while the feet are cold like water, moxibustion should be applied to the Yangfu acupoint. It also notes that if there is coldness in the knee, treatment should involve the Qugu point. </p>
<p>The &quot;Yixue Rumen&quot; states that for corpse qi, one should focus on the Baihui acupoint, which is particularly effective with needling at the Yinbai point. Additionally, blowing with a pen tube into the ear is suggested; needling Baihui is also effective, with similar results from needling at the Shangxing point. </p>
<p>The &quot;Gujin Yitong&quot; explains that for reversal of qi, moxibustion should be applied to the Renzhong acupoint, which is located below the nose, with seven moxa sessions. Alternatively, needling to the teeth is also effective. The Xinde acupoint located in the depression between the two breasts should receive moxibustion for twenty sessions. </p>
<p>Another method involves wrapping a rope around the wrist; men on the left, women on the right, taking the rope from the Daizui down to the middle of the spine, with the end point being the acupoint, applying moxibustion for twenty-two sessions to achieve healing.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: When the hands and feet are cold and reversed, first focus on the navel, then on the Yongquan (bubbling spring) point. Pull from the ribs upwards to the navel, then from the navel downwards to the Yongquan, and finally from the left ribs across to the right ribs, and from the right ribs across to the left ribs, doing this six times each.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Righteous Way to Serve Parents&quot; states: A man was ill with phlegm and syncope, not recognizing people, with tightly clenched jaws, unable to take any medicine, awaiting death. A practitioner saw him and asked if there was any saliva in the patient’s mouth. The answer was yes. The practitioner first prepared a decoction of Fangfeng and Lilies (zhilong), mixing it with powdered melon seed to administer orally. When that couldn’t go down, he took a long clam shell, ground off the sharp edge, wrapped the tip in paper, and applied it to the right nostril, hearing a sound as it swallowed. Then he did the same for the left nostril. The practitioner remarked: &quot;He can be treated now.&quot; After a while, as no saliva came out, he then used one qian of arsenic and administered it through the nose. Suddenly the patient lay back, seeming to feel pain, and shortly thereafter spat out a large quantity of thick, fishy saliva. Arsenic should usually not be used; because the illness was severe, this was the only method to stimulate movement. However, without melon seeds, it should not be used casually, and care should be taken. Generally, for those suffering from phlegm obstruction due to stroke, people often mistakenly focus only on wind treatments, relying on ineffective wind medicines. Liu Hejian treated stroke by addressing fire first, thus applying this method effectively within the context of fire.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>Xi Hua&#39;s illness was a chill-induced collapse, while his wife&#39;s was heat-induced. For over ten years, she had taken Xiao Yao San with no effect. One day, she requested my diagnosis. Both had pulses that were large but weak. Xi Hua said, &quot;My hands and feet are cold, and I soak them in hot soup, yet the chill does not stop; my wife&#39;s hands and feet are warm, and she soaks them in cold water, yet the heat does not subside. Why is this?&quot; I replied, &quot;It is a case of chill and heat-induced collapse. Both are the result of excessive eating and indulgence.&quot; I then referenced the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; to explain the condition. Xi Hua rejoiced, saying, &quot;After ten years of doubt, I now understand. Even without taking medicine, I am already more than half healed.&quot; I said, &quot;In heat-induced collapse, cold is above; in chill-induced collapse, heat is above. For cold above, use warming agents to tonify the lung; for heat above, use cooling agents to clear heart fire.&quot; I prescribed two medicines, urging them to continue taking them without interruption. Within a few months, Xi Hua came to express his gratitude, stating, &quot;Both the chill and heat-induced collapses have been cured.&quot;<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>&quot;The Medical Book of Essential Reading&quot; states: A friend, Han Maoyuan, suffered from a severe cold for nine days, unable to speak, see, or move, with all limbs cold; many declared it a shadow illness. Upon examining him, I found no pulse; pressing on his abdomen with both hands, I noticed his brow furrowed in distress. I pressed on the foot yang point, which was large and robust, indicating dried feces in the abdomen. I wanted to give him the Major Purge Decoction, but the patient was fearful and hesitant. I said: &#39;In our county, only Shi Lizhe can identify this condition.&#39; After a delay, he was diagnosed by me and spoke as if he understood. I then administered the decoction, and he expelled six or seven pieces of dried feces, regaining ability to speak and move. How could those who only checked the hands, not the feet, rescue him from this critical condition?</p>
<p>I treated Lady Yanhua Quan, who initially suffered from chest and abdominal pain and suddenly collapsed the next day, with cold hands and feet. A physician had prepared a cow bile pill for her to take. Upon examination, I found her pulse deep, but the qi at the mouth slightly moved, indicating food stagnation in the chest. With yin and yang blocked, and ascent and descent obstructed, the pulse was hidden while qi was somewhat observable. I took one tael of dried orange peel and sand seeds, eight qian of ginger, and three qian of salt, decocting them for a finger probing and inducing vomiting, resulting in five or six bowls of food being expelled, revealing the pulse completely. The left guan pulse was large, and the chest and abdominal pain was severe; I knew it was caused by great anger. I prescription wood incense, green peel, tangerine skins, white atractylodes, and cyperus, decocting and prescribing; with two doses, the pain ceased. I then used the Four Gentlemen Decoction plus wood incense and black myrrh, adjusting the treatment for over ten days before she fully recovered. This involved both food stagnation and qi stagnation.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>In the Wu Gate, Zhou Fu&#39;an, at the age of fifty, was indulging in wine and pleasure. Suddenly, he experienced headaches and fever. The doctor treated him with Qianghuo Decoction, resulting in continuous sweating and a loss of consciousness. I applied moxibustion on his Guan Yuan point ten times, and he woke up. I prescribed the Four Gentlemen Decoction augmented with ginger and cinnamon for daily consumption, and by the third day, he showed signs of recovery. However, when he began to analyze his estate, the exertion and anger caused a relapse. I used one and a half taels of good ginseng, two qian of熟附 (prepared Rehmannia), and ten slices of cooked ginger, which slightly revived him, but he would faint again upon turning. In one day, he experienced seven fainting spells, consuming three taels of ginseng. The next day, I gave him mutton soup and glutinous rice porridge, yet he fainted two or three more times. By the fifth day, the fainting spells stabilized. He wept to me, saying: &quot;I have already received rebirth; I wonder if I will fully recover?&quot; I replied: &quot;Your pulse shows a rooted vitality, but your vital energy is extremely deficient; it will take three years of care and adjustment for you to truly regain health.&quot; Fortunately, he faithfully heeded my words and adhered to the medication. In two months, he consumed four pounds of ginseng, and within three years, he took six hundred doses of medicine and over seventy pounds of pills, until he was able to walk as before. His many family and friends voiced various opinions, but if not for the patient’s sole commitment to the treatment, or if there had been any lingering doubts, or if there had been any negligence in taking the medicine, few would have achieved recovery.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of the Xue Family&quot; states: A man experienced fullness in his chest after eating little, with cold hands and feet, a fear of cold and a fever, and he was spitting phlegm. During meals, he felt nausea and used remedies like Qingqi Huatan and Erchen, as well as bitter orange, which caused his chest and abdomen to swell, resulting in vomiting of phlegm and food, with dribbling urination. He then used Sifeng, Lian, Banxia, Zhimu, and Cheqian, but his urination did not improve, and his condition worsened. I said: This is a case of weak spleen and stomach with cold and no fire, hence food cannot be digested and is regurgitated. I then used Bawei Pill to tonify fire and generate earth, added ingredients like ginger and cinnamon to support the center and stimulate Yang Qi, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Great General Wang Jun experienced vomiting of accumulated food, severe abdominal pain, cold hands and feet, and a weak pulse. He took a dose of Fuzhong Wan which significantly helped. His pulse became floating and large, but weak upon pressure; using Shenfu Decoction, he improved rapidly.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　厥逆之证，危证也。盖厥者尽也，逆者乱也，即气血败乱之谓也。故《内经》特重而详言之。即云卒厥暴厥者，皆厥逆之总名也。如云寒厥热厥者，分厥逆之阴阳也。如云连经连脏者，论厥逆之死生也。再若诸经脏腑之辨，亦既详矣。叉近世犹有气厥、血厥，痰厥，酒厥，蛔厥等证，亦无非本之经义。观《内经》诸纶，已极颢明，奈何后人犹不能察，凡遇此证，则悉认之为中风，竟不知厥逆为何证，而通作风治，害孰甚焉！余深悲之，故于前非风门悉力辨正。至于治此之法，即当以前非风证治，互相参用，正所以治厥逆也。其有未尽等证，仍列于后条。<a id="orig-85p" href="#trans-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　凡寒厥者，必四肢清凉，脉沉微不数，或虽数而无力，或畏寒喜热，引衣自覆，或下利清谷，形证多惺惺。虽此类皆属寒证，然似热非热之证犹多。故凡以手足见厥而脉证俱经无实热者，悉寒厥之无疑也。热厥者必先多热证，脉沉滑而数，畏热喜冷，扬手掉足，或烦躁不宁，大便秘赤，形证多昏冒。凡治此二者，即当以非风门治寒治热之法主之。至若伤寒厥证，其阴其阳，亦当以此法为辨。但伤寒之厥，辨在邪气，故寒厥宜温，热厥宜攻也。<a id="orig-86p" href="#trans-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>《内经》之厥重在元气，故热厥当补阴，寒厥当补阳也。二者之治，不可不察！　　气厥之证有二，以气虚气实皆能厥也。气虚卒倒者，必其形气索然，色清白，身微冷，脉微弱，此气脱证也，宜参、芪、归、朮、地黄、枸杞、大补元煎之属，甚者以回阳饮、独参汤之类主之。气实而厥者，其形气愤然勃然，脉沉弦而滑，胸膈喘满，此气逆证也。大怒则形气绝而血菀于上，即此类也，治宜以排气饮，或四磨饮，或八味顺气散、苏合香丸之类先顺其气，然后随其虚实而调理之。<a id="orig-87p" href="#trans-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>若因怒伤气逆，气旋去而真气受损者，气本不实也，若素多忧郁恐畏而气怯气陷者，其虚尤可知，若以此类而用行气开滞等剂则误矣。　　血厥之证有二，以血脱血逆皆能厥也。血脱者，如大崩大吐，或产血尽脱，则气亦随之而脱，故致卒仆暴死。宜先掐人中，或烧酢炭以收其气，急用人参一二两煎汤灌之，但使气不尽脱，必渐苏矣；然后因其寒热，徐为调理，此所谓血脱益气也。若不知此而但用血分等药，则几微之气，忽而散失，阴无所主，无生机矣。其或有用寒凉以止血者，必致败绝阳气，适足以速其死耳。<a id="orig-88p" href="#trans-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>血逆者，即经所云血之与气并走于上之谓，又曰大怒则形气绝而血菀于上之类也。夫血因气逆，必须先理其气，气行则血无不行也。宜通瘀煎或化肝煎之类主之，俟血行气舒，然后随证调理。　　凡一时痰涎壅塞，气闭昏愦，药食俱不能通，必先宜或吐或开以治其标，此不得不先救其急也。但觉痰气稍开，便当治其病本。如因火生痰者，宜清之降之；因风寒生痰者，宜散之温之；因湿生痰者，宜燥之利之；因脾虚生痰者，自宜补脾；因肾虚生痰者，自宜补肾。此痰之不必治也，但治其所以生痰而痰自清矣。然犹有不可治痰者，恐愈攻愈虚而痰必愈甚也。<a id="orig-89p" href="#trans-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>诸治痰法，见前非风门治痰条中。　　酒厥之证，即经所云热厥之属也。又经云酒风者，亦此类也。凡纵饮无节之人，多有此病。方其血气正盛，力能胜之，不知酒害之何有，及其将衰，则酒之侮人，斯可畏耳。酒病极多，莫知所出，其为酒厥，则全似中风，轻者犹自知人，重者卒而运倒，忽然昏愦，或躁烦，或不语，或痰涎如涌，或气喘发热，或咳嗽，或吐血。但察其大便干燥，脉实喜冷者，此湿热上壅之证，宜以抽薪饮之类，疾降其火。<a id="orig-90p" href="#trans-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>火之甚者，仍以梨浆饮、菉豆饮之属更迭进之，以解其毒。此证大忌辛燥等物，务使湿热渐退，神气稍复，然后用补阴等剂以善其后。其有大便不实，或无火证而脉见缓弱者，则不宜清火，但以二陈汤、六君子汤，或金水六君煎之类主之。若因酒伤阴，以致脾肾两虚而为厥脱者，非速救本源，终无济也。凡患此者，宜终身忌酒，勿使沾唇可也；若不知戒，再犯必难为矣。　　色厥之证有二，一曰暴脱，一曰动血也。凡色厥之暴脱者，必以其人本虚，偶因奇遇而悉力勉为者有之；或因相慕日久而纵竭情欲者亦有之。故于事后则气随精去，而暴脱不返。<a id="orig-91p" href="#trans-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>宜急掐人中，仍令阴人搂定，用口相对，务使暖气嘘通，以接其气，勿令放脱，以保其神；随速用独参汤灌之，或速灸气海数十壮，以复阳气，庶可挽回。但以临时慌张，焉知料理，故每致不救。然此以即病者言，所见诚不多也。其有不即病而病此者，则甚多也。又何以言之？以其精去于频，而气脱于渐，故每于房欲二三日之后，方见此证。但因其病不在即，故不以此为病，兼之人多讳此，而不知中年之后，多有因此而病者，是皆所谓色厥也，奈时师不能察而每以中风毙之耳。<a id="orig-92p" href="#trans-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>凡治此者，单宜培补命门，或水或火，当以非风门治法第三条者主之。　　又色厥之动血者，以其血气并走于上，亦血厥之属也。但与大怒血逆者不同，而治法亦有所异。盖此因欲火上炎，故血随气上，必其情欲动极而欲不能遂者有之，或借曲蘗以强遏郁火者亦有之。其证则忽而暴吐，或鼻衄不能禁止，或厥逆，或汗出，或气喘，或咳嗽，此皆以阴火上冲而然。凡治此者，必先制火以抑其势，清满化饮，四阴煎或加减一阴煎之类主之。其有阴竭于下，火不归源，别无烦热脉证，而血厥不止垂危者，非镇阴煎必不能救，待其势定，然后因证酌治之。<a id="orig-93p" href="#trans-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>　　　　　阴阳二厥</p>

<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Regulation of the Four Seasons and the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>In winter, during the three months, this is the time of closing and storing. The water freezes and the earth cracks; there should be no disruption to the Yang (positive energy). Sleep early and rise late, and wait for sunlight, allowing your will to be quiet and concealed, as if having private intentions or already possessing something. Avoid cold and seek warmth, preserving the skin from leakage, ensuring the energy does not escape suddenly. This is the proper response to winter energy, the way of nourishment and storage. To go against this will injure the kidneys, leading to atrophy and coldness in spring, making it hard for those who give life (i.e., caregivers) to have vitality. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: All things are collected and closed during winter; the Yang energy is stored, so do not disturb it by leaking out. Sleep early and rise late, following the nurturing and storing energy, and be sure to wait for sunlight to avoid cold evils. Keep your thoughts inward, without external distractions. If there are private intentions or if one feels content, the spirit and energy are kept within. Avoid cold and seek warmth to nurture the Yang; do not allow the skin&#39;s warmth to be leaked and its root energy to be suddenly taken away. All these are in accordance with winter energy and represent the way to nurture and store energy. To go against winter’s storing energy will injure the kidneys, leading to illness such as atrophy in spring and difficulties for caregivers.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Discussion on Shen</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes cold and heat to lead to Shen? Qi Bo replied: When Yang qi declines below, it results in cold Shen; when Yin qi declines below, it results in heat Shen. </p>
<p>(Note: When qi is reversed, it causes confusion, leading to dizziness or fainting, and one may suddenly lose awareness of others. This condition is termed Shen, which differs from a stroke. There are conditions of both cold and heat, and both Yin and Yang energy are involved. Both Yin and Yang qi rise from below; hence, the causes of cold and heat Shen arise from the decline of these energies below.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The heat of heat Shen certainly arises from below the feet, why is that? Qi Bo replied: Yang qi rises from the tips of the toes, while the Yin vessels gather below the feet and converge at the soles. Therefore, when Yang qi prevails, it generates heat below the feet.</p>
<p>(Note: When Yang qi dominates, Yin qi becomes deficient and Yang takes precedence, thus heat Shen originates from below the feet.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The cold of cold Shen certainly must ascend from the toes to the knees, why is that? Qi Bo replied: Yin qi rises from within the toes, gathers beneath the knees, and converges above the knees; hence, when Yin qi prevails, it results in cold rising from the toes to the knees. This cold is not from the outside, but entirely from within.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The note explains that the blood and energy of the Three Yin originate at the ends of the inner sides of the five fingers and gather below the knees, where the three Yin intersect above the ankles; when accumulated above the knees, the Three Yin meridians rise along the inner thigh. Thus, the cold comes not from the outside but rather from within.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What causes cold and convulsions?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The front Yin is where the Zong muscles converge, a meeting of the Tai Yin and Yang Ming. In spring and summer, Yang energy is abundant while Yin energy is sparse; in autumn and winter, Yin energy is strong while Yang energy declines. If a person is robust yet suffers from a loss during autumn and winter, their lower energy contends with the upper, failing to recover. Vital essence overflows downward, and evils rise with it. When the energy originates within, Yang energy weakens, failing to nourish the channels of the meridians. With diminishing Yang energy and only Yin remaining, the hands and feet become cold.&quot;</p>
<p>The note further elaborates that the root of the Zong muscles arises from within the womb, connecting inwardly to the kidneys. The dual energies of Yin and Yang are generated in the stomach and transmitted to the Tai Yin, stored in the kidneys. The gathering of Tai Yin and Yang Ming in the Zong muscles occurs between the middle and lower Jiao, combining in the region of the front Yin. During autumn and winter, when Yang energy is conserved and Yin energy is prominent, this condition leads to cold convulsions; the robust physical nature leads one to overexert, causing lower energy to contend with upper energy, thus failing to be contained below. When Yang energy escapes upward, the essence of the Yin organs likewise overflows downward.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Evil qi refers to the cold and dampness associated with the yin organs. The yang qi resides in the yin organs, and when the essence of yang emerges, the yin coldness rises along with it. Therefore, the yang produced in the middle burner also diminishes, unable to nourish the channels and collaterals. The qi in the upper and lower parts cannot mutually support one another, causing the yang qi to gradually deplete while the yin qi remains alone, hence the hands and feet become cold.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What about heat stroke, how does that occur?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When alcohol enters the stomach, the collaterals become full while the main channels are empty. The spleen is responsible for transporting the fluids of the stomach. When yin qi is deficient, yang qi intrudes; when yang qi intrudes, the stomach becomes unharmonious. If the stomach is unharmonious, the essence and qi are depleted; if the essence and qi are depleted, it cannot nourish the four limbs. This person must frequently get drunk, especially after indulging, as the qi accumulates in the spleen and cannot disperse. The qi of the alcohol mingles with the qi of the grains, creating excessive internal heat, which spreads throughout the body, leading to internal heat and red urine. The abundant alcohol qi is fierce, which gradually diminishes the kidney qi, allowing the yang qi to dominate, hence the hands and feet become hot.</p>
<p>Note: Wei qi is the vigorous qi of water and grains. Alcohol is also a vigorous and hot liquid derived from water and grains, therefore it follows the wei qi to surface on the skin and fills the collaterals, rather than moving through the channels alongside the spleen qi, resulting in full collaterals and empty channels. If it does not pass through the spleen qi to circulate in the channels, then yin qi is deficient.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the fierce heat rises from outside to within, the Yang energy enters. The Yangming is the organ of dryness and heat, which derives its essence from the Yin of the Taiyin. When the Yin energy is deficient and Yang heat enters, the stomach energy becomes unbalanced, leading to a depletion of the vital essences that cannot nourish the limbs. If one drinks alcohol excessively, the alcohol energy accumulates in the spleen; if one indulges excessively, the food energy remains trapped in the stomach, and the spleen cannot metabolize its essences. As the food energy accumulates and cannot disperse, the alcohol energy and food energy invade each other, resulting in excessive internal heat. The heat from the central region spreads to the surroundings, causing heat to pervade the body. If the food and drink entering the stomach cannot circulate the vital essences downward to the bladder, this results in internal heat and red urine. The kidneys, as the water organs, receive and store the essences of food and water. When the alcohol heat is strong and vigorous, the vital essences of the kidneys diminish daily, the Yin energy dwindles below, and the Yang energy prevails within, causing the hands and feet to become hot.</p>
<p>The Emperor then asked: Why do some experience abdominal fullness, some suddenly become unaware of their surroundings, and some may take half a day or even a whole day to regain awareness? Qibo replied: When Yin energy is strong above, the lower part becomes deficient, leading to abdominal fullness. When Yang energy is strong above, it causes the lower energy to press upwards, creating a reversal of evil energies. This reversal disrupts the Yang energy, and when the Yang energy is disordered, it results in a loss of awareness.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: When the yang is obstructed from knowing the person, there may suddenly arise confusion or fainting. The qi of half a day refers to the half cycle of qi circulation, while the qi of a whole day refers to the complete cycle of qi. When the yin qi is strong above, it indicates damage to the yang qi in the middle burner, with the yin qi alone prevailing above. When the yin is dominant above, the yang qi of the lower burner is also deficient, leading to yang deficiency below, which causes abdominal distension. The lower qi refers to the primordial yang of the lower burner, and the evil qi is the cold water of the kidneys. When the yang qi is strong above, it signifies that the yin qi is deficient and the yang qi prevails alone. When the yang is strong above, the lower qi rises up; if the lower qi ascends, cold evil follows and rises against it, disrupting the yang qi above and causing sudden confusion. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. I wish to hear about the conditions of the six meridians and the diseases they represent. Qibo replied: If there is blockage in the Greater Yang, the head becomes swollen and heavy, and the feet cannot move, leading to fainting or collapsing. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the yang of the feet is reversed upwards, it causes swelling in the head and head pain; if it reverses downwards, then the feet cannot move, both being diseases of the Greater Yang. When the spirit and qi become confused, it leads to dizziness and fainting, as the Greater Yang is the master of all yang energies. </p>
<p>If the yangming is blocked, it results in manic agitation, a desire to run and shout, abdominal fullness that prevents lying down, a red and hot face, and delusions of seeing and speaking falsely.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Mania, agitation, shouting, and delusional speech and sight are diseases of the yangming meridian.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to the reversal of qi, the abdomen is bloated, and if the stomach is not harmonious, one cannot sleep. The Yangming channel is the channel of dryness and heat; its qi emerges at the face, hence the face is red and hot. If the Shaoyang channel is in a state of reversal, there will be sudden deafness, swelling and heat in the cheeks, pain in the flanks, and the legs will be unable to move. </p>
<p>In the case of the Taiyin channel&#39;s reversal, there is abdominal fullness and swelling, difficulty with bowel movements, lack of appetite, and if one eats, there will be vomiting, preventing sleep. This is because, when food and drink enter the stomach, the spleen is responsible for transformation and transportation; if qi is reversed in the spleen, there will be difficulty with bowel movements. If the spleen does not transport and regulate, then the stomach will also not be harmonious, resulting in vomiting and inability to sleep.</p>
<p>In the event of the Shaoyin channel&#39;s reversal, there may be dry mouth, red urine, abdominal fullness, and heart pain. This occurs because the reversal of the meridian prevents the yin fluids from ascending, leading to dry mouth and heart pain. The lung channel cannot regulate smoothly downward, hence the red urine. The interaction of water and fire, yin and yang qi does not harmonize, resulting in abdominal fullness.</p>
<p>For the Jueyin channel&#39;s reversal, there will be swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, difficulty with urination, a tendency to sleep while bending the knees, swelling of the yin areas, and internal heat in the legs. The reversal causes swelling and pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal bloating, with difficulty in urination and swelling in the yin areas.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The liver governs the tendons, and the knee is where the tendons converge. When the meridians experience counterflow, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, thus leading to a tendency to lie down with the knees bent. The Jueyin wood and fire govern qi, causing counterflow and resulting in swelling and heat in the knee.</p>
<p>When there is excess, it should be drained; when there is deficiency, it should be replenished. When there is neither excess nor deficiency, it should be adjusted according to the meridian.</p>
<p>Note: Since the counterflow occurs in the meridians, treatment should follow the meridian. If the qi in the meridian is excessive, use needles to drain and disperse it. If the qi is deficient, use needles to tonify it. When there is neither excess nor deficiency, harmonizing movements of the primary meridian is termed &#39;meridian needling.&#39;</p>
<p>In the case of Taiyin counterflow, when the knee is cramping sharply, and there is pain in the heart radiating to the abdomen, it treats the main disease. </p>
<p>Note: The qi of the Central Plains governs the nourishment of surrounding areas. When the Foot Taiyin qi is in counterflow, it causes cramping in the knee. The spleen qi is counterflowing and cannot transport its essence, which leads to heart qi being deficient and causing pain radiating to the abdomen. This is a disease originating from the spleen, so it is necessary to treat the spleen qi directly.</p>
<p>In the case of Shaoyin counterflow, with fullness and vomiting, causing clear diarrhea, it treats the main disease.</p>
<p>Note: The qi of Shaoyin combines with Yangming from above to govern the transformation of food and fluids. The counterflow of Shaoyin qi leads to excessive fullness in the middle burner, resulting in vomiting. When the qi of water and fire does not transform properly, it results in clear, cold diarrhea.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

Note: &quot;Contraction&quot; is governed by the liver, the waist is the exterior of the liver, &quot;fullness&quot; means that food and qi cannot disperse the essence in the liver, and &quot;front closure&quot; indicates the liver governs smooth flow. The liver governs speech; delirium occurs when liver qi is stagnant.</p>
<p>When all three yin are reversed, movement in the front and back ceases, causing coldness in the hands and feet, leading to death in three days. Note: &quot;All three yin are reversed&quot; indicates a separation of yin and yang. When there is no movement in the front and back, the yin pertains to the lower body. Since all yang energy is born from yin, if all three yin are reversed, the life force is extinguished, resulting in cold hands and feet and death in three days.</p>
<p>The taiyang reverse flow causes stiffness, collapse, vomiting blood, and nosebleeds, treating the principal diseases. Note: The reverse flow of taiyang energy causes stiffness and collapse. When yang energy rises excessively, it causes vomiting of blood, and when yang heat is in the upper body, it causes nosebleeds.</p>
<p>The shaoyang reverse flow leads to dysfunction in the joints. When the joints are dysfunctional, the waist cannot move, and the neck cannot turn. Note: Shaoyang governs the joints; therefore, if shaoyang energy is in reverse, the joints are affected.

<p>The two Yin conditions urgently cause seizures. The two Yin refers to the Lesser Yin. A seizure is characterized by fainting, collapsing, and being unaware of one’s surroundings. This is because the watery Qi is surging upon the heart, leading to an urgent pulse in the two Yin channels.

<p>The condition referred to as &quot;entering the center&quot; and becoming mute indicates that the Yang has become abundant and then declined, resulting in muteness. If the inner energy is depleted and leads to Jue, this indicates kidney deficiency. If the Lesser Yin does not arrive, it indicates Jue. &quot;Entering the center and becoming mute&quot; means the Yang has become abundant and then declined, resulting in a deficiency of the vital energy, leading to muteness. When Yang is abundant externally but its stored energy is depleted, it results in kidney deficiency. If Yang receives energy from the limbs but then declines, the extremities do not retract, resulting in lethargy. If the kidney energy is insufficient, it leads to muteness, preventing the Qi of the Lesser Yin from arriving, causing coldness in the hands and feet.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Yin and Yang</h3>
<p>The Three Yangs result in illness manifesting as cold and heat, leading to boils and swellings, as well as atrophy and numbness. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Three Yangs refer to the Taiyang, which governs the exterior. When an evil force penetrates, it starts at the skin and hair, clashing with the righteous qi, resulting in illnesses characterized by cold and heat. Taiyang governs opening; if illness prevents this, the evil qi obstructs the flesh, leading to boils and swellings. Taiyang is the master of all Yang qi and governs the tendons; if the tendons are harmed, it results in atrophy; if the qi is harmed, it leads to numbness.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Pulse and Its Subtleties</h3>
<p>Numbness leads to vertigo.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Numbness is the reversal of qi upwards. When qi solely reverses upwards, it transforms into a condition of the head.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Evaluation of Deficiency and Excess</h3>
<p>Jaundice, acute pain, epilepsy, and convulsive states are born from prolonged reversals.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Jaundice is due to damp heat accumulating internally, with the resulting discoloration appearing externally. Acute pain arises from an imbalance of qi within the five organs, resulting in sudden pain. Vertigo and convulsions are due to excess or deficiency of Yin and Yang manifesting as illness. All of these arise from prolonged disharmony of the Yin-Yang and the Five Elements.</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Yangming Pulse</h3>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor asked: When there is a disease causing fever and sweating, yet the feeling of fullness and restlessness does not resolve with sweating, what is this illness? Qi Bo replied: Sweating and fever indicate wind, but when sweating does not relieve the feeling of fullness and restlessness, it is due to obstruction (jue). This illness is called wind obstruction.</p>
<p>The note explains: Wind is a yang pathogen that opens the skin and causes fluids to leak out; when wind-heat remains, it leads to fever. If wind-heat does not dispel, it can harm the kidney energy and cause it to reverse upward. When it reverses upwards, it induces heart restlessness; when it affects the spleen, it causes a feeling of fullness. The sickness is named wind obstruction because it arises from the wind pathogen causing the kidney energy to reverse.</p>
<p>The Emperor requested to hear more. Qi Bo continued: The great yang governs energy, so it is the first to receive pathogens. The lesser yin is its internal counterpart. If heat is present, it follows that the energy will become obstructed. The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: Treat both the exterior and interior by needling, and administer medicinal soup.</p>
<p>The note elaborates: The energy of the greater yang governs the exterior, while wind is a yang pathogen that injures human yang energy; the clash of two yangs results in heat illness. The lesser yin and greater yang correspond internally and externally; when yang heat is on the surface, the yin energy follows, resulting in obstruction. Needle the exterior to dispel the yang pathogen of wind-heat, and needle the interior to address the reversed energy of the lesser yin; give medicinal soup to assist with the fluid and sweat.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the evil influences are at the networks of the Foot Shaoyin, Taiyin, and Foot Yangming, all five networks converge at the ear.

<p>[Note: All meridians originate in the Foot Shaoyin kidneys, are produced in the Foot Yangming stomach, conveyed through the Foot Taiyin spleen, governed by the Hand Shaoyin heart, and directed to the Hand Taiyin lungs; thus, the energy of the five meridians converges at the ear. The network at the left ear is linked to the liver, which rules blood and resides on the left, its energy rising to the crown. When all five networks are exhausted, the nourishment and defense do not circulate, causing the body’s arteries to tremble yet remain unaware, termed corpse syndrome. The reason one lives and moves is through the circulation of energy and blood; when blood and energy do not flow, the form becomes like a corpse. Needle the great toe at the hidden white point of the Foot Taiyin, needle the heart at the springing point of the Foot Shaoyin; needle the middle finger at the mouth of the Foot Yangming; needle the great finger at the lesser merchant point of the Hand Taiyin; needle the heart&#39;s master point of the Hand Shaoyin. This will clear the blood and energy, and the syndrome will cease. If it does not cease, use a bamboo tube to blow at both ears to clear the ancestral vessels, cut the hair at the left ear to clear the nourishing blood, and drink fine wine to clear the defensive energy.]<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>When metal is insufficient, it is termed as following the changes. The period of transformation is called &quot;breaking and receiving.&quot; Its qi rises, its use is hasty and sharp, and its movement is like a clang that confuses and collapses. </p>
<p>When the lesser yang is in control of heaven, there is qi reversal. </p>
<p>The earth is in the center; if the diaphragm is not open, then there is a reversal of qi between above and below. When the greater yin is in control of heaven, the damp qi descends, and the kidney qi rises, causing a reversal of qi. </p>
<p>If the yang qi does not rise, then the hands and feet will experience qi reversal.</p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Correct Principles of the Six Origins</strong></p>
<p>When water is stagnant, the people tend to experience qi reversal. </p>
<p>The reversal of qi arises from the storage of yang qi below, which causes a blockage in the middle qi. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The one who reverses and enters the stomach, water insults the earth. The stomach channels connect upwards to the heart, hence the heartache. The return of the sun causes the counterflow of qi to rise.</p>
<p>This refers to the stagnant cold qi rising, which resembles the qi from a year and a half prior. All counterflows downward belong to the lower regions. When the yang qi above reverses, it causes counter-cold. The lesser yin is in the spring, ruling that when victorious, the counter qi rises causing heart pain.</p>
<p>The ascending counter qi is governed by cold water, which ascends above the ruler fire in spring.</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion on abundance and decline, the thunder god asked how to distinguish the amount of qi and which is contrary and which is following. The Yellow Emperor replied: yang moves from the left, yin from the right. The elderly move from above, the young from below. Thus, spring and summer returning to yang signifies life, while returning to autumn and winter signifies death. Conversely, returning to autumn and winter can signify life, hence the excessive qi that is contrary is all a counterflow. </p>
<p>The question arose: Is an excess considered a counterflow? The answer was: If rising without descending, then cold counterflow reaches the knees, leading to death in the young during autumn and winter while the elderly may live. When qi rises without descending, headaches occur and the crown of the head experiences illness. Seeking yang yields nothing, while seeking yin is unclear; the five regions are isolated without signs, akin to being in a wilderness or lying in an empty chamber, endlessly incomplete within the day. Therefore, the lesser qi’s counterflow leads to delusive dreams, reaching the ultimate state of confusion.</p>
<p>The comment on yang moving from the left indicates that the qi of spring and summer flows from the left to the right, and the yin from the right indicates that the qi of autumn and winter flows from the right to the left.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the elderly descends from above, like the autumn atmosphere gradually declining downwards; the energy of the young ascends from below, like the spring atmosphere flourishing upwards. Therefore, the energies of spring and summer return to the Yang, moving from left to right, which follows the natural order, hence this is the vitality; while the energies of autumn and winter return to the Yin, moving from right to left, which defies the order, thus this is the state of decline. Conversely, the autumn and winter energies returning to the Yin moving from right to left signify life, while returning to spring and summer moving from left to right signifies disorder. Thus, regardless of the amount of energy, anything contrary signifies stagnation. </p>
<p>One speaks of a single Yin energy. If it rises and does not descend, and the cold stagnation reaches the knees, this is the ascending of Yin energy according to the dictates of autumn and winter. Therefore, the elderly align with the natural order, while the young are contrary. The energy discussed here pertains to a single Yang energy. If it rises and does not descend, and headaches manifest, this represents Yang energy ascending directly to the crown. </p>
<p>If one is unaware of the way the heavens, earth, and humanity combine, seeking Yang without attaining the energy, or seeking Yin without discerning its subtleties, then one becomes cut off and lacks evidence. A deficiency in energy leads to the reversed ascension of energy.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>The pulse of the Lung&#39;s Hand Taiyin is characterized by severe movement leading to dizziness when the two hands cross, which indicates limb cessation. This pulse governs lung-related illnesses, causing pain and cessation in the inner and anterior areas of the upper arm.<br><em>Note:</em> Dizziness due to crossing the hands is caused by kidney qi rebounding. The pain and cessation in the upper arm represents the affected section of the meridian.</p>
<p>The pulse of the Heart&#39;s Hand Shaoyin, when in motion, causes dryness in the throat, heart pain, thirst, and the desire to drink, which indicates limb cessation; this pulse governs heart-related illnesses, resulting in pain and cessation in the inner and posterior areas of the upper arm.<br><em>Note:</em> The upper arm is the section governed by the central pulse.</p>
<p>The pulse of the Bladder&#39;s Foot Taiyang, when in movement, leads to headaches, bulging eyes, a stiff neck, back pain, waist discomfort, difficulty bending the hip, tightness in the knee, and sensation of rupture in the ankle, indicating ankle cessation.<br><em>Note:</em> This illness pertains to the energy of the Taiyang.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p>Clear qi resides in yin, while turbid qi is in yang. Nourishing qi flows smoothly through the channels, while defending qi moves against the current. When clear and turbid qi interfere, it causes chaos in the chest, which is known as great confusion.

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Why does the lesser yin pulse flow downward alone? Qi Bo replied: The chong vessel is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels; all are nourished by it. The upper part emerges from the temples, permeates the yang, and irrigates the essence; the lower part enters the great network of the lesser yin, emerging from the qi street, flowing along the inner thigh into the knee, lying within the skin of the calf, and descending to the back of the inner ankle. The lower section connects with the lesser yin channel and penetrates the three yin; the front part flows within the foot, descending along the ankle, entering between the big toe, nourishing the network and warming the muscles.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is timid and frail, then the pathways of water will not be effective, and the energy will dissipate. The energy of the five organs and six bowels is all derived from the Chong channel. Those that rise from the head diffuse through the Yang and flow into the Yin; those that descend are connected to the Lesser Yin&#39;s major channel, exiting at the Qi Street. The blood and energy of the five organs and six bowels all pass through the Chong channel and permeate between the skin and meridians, responding to water and following Qi to operate on the surface. The Lesser Yin governs the primal water and fire, which are essence and energy. The Chong channel and the meridian of Lesser Yin permeate the three Yin channels, circulating through the ankles and entering between the big toes, radiating through the collaterals to warm the muscles. This essence and energy of the Lesser Yin flows out and operates beyond the channels and skin. Therefore, if the collaterals are obstructed, the energy of the Lesser Yin cannot circulate through the ankle, causing the ankle to become immobile. When it is immobile, it indicates that the energy of the Lesser Yin is stagnant within, leading to coldness.</p>
<p>The Thunder Lord said: Young ones, those who hear the wind are at the beginning of myriad illnesses; reversal indicates the onset of cold dampness. How does one differentiate? The Yellow Emperor replied: The regular phenomenon is that at the gate of the palace, thin moisture produces wind, turbid energy causes obstruction in the body, and on the ground it leads to reversal; these are the norms, each indicated by its corresponding color concerning the disease. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Ground&quot; refers to the Earth Pavilion. Wind represents the weather, thus regularly appearing at the palace courtyard. Cold dampness indicates the energy of the Earth, hence it is observed in the terrestrial area. Wind is a Yang pathology, hence its color is thin moisture. Cold dampness is a Yin pathology, hence its color is turbid energy.)<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>If the illness is accompanied by delirium or nonsensical speech, there should be heat in the body, the pulse should be rapid and large; however, if the hands and feet are cold and the pulse is deep, thin, and weak, it indicates death.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials from the Golden Chamber</strong> (Han, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>In the section on internal organs, it is stated: A question is posed: When the pulse is deep, large, and slippery, the deepness indicates something real, while the slipperiness indicates Qi. When the real Qi clashes, it causes blood Qi to enter the internal organs, leading to death; if it enters the bowels, recovery occurs. This is known as sudden reversal. What does this mean? The teacher says: The lips and mouth may be blue, and the body cold, indicating entry into the internal organs, leading to death; if the body is warm and there is spontaneous sweating, it indicates entry into the bowels, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In the section on abdominal fullness: If there is abdominal pain with a tight, wiry pulse, the tightness indicates stagnation of defensive Qi, leading to aversion to cold; the wiriness indicates lack of appetite; when evil and correct Qi clash, it results in cold hernia. Cold hernia causes pain around the navel, and if it develops, a white fluid may be discharged, with hands and feet feeling cold; if the pulse is deep and tight, the decoction of Aconitum should be employed.</p>
<p>In the section on water Qi: If the pulse at the wrist is slow and thin, the slowness indicates coldness, while thinness indicates insufficient blood. The pulse at the foot yin position is weak and slow; weakness indicates Qi, slowness indicates cold, and insufficient cold Qi results in hands and feet feeling cold. If hands and feet are cold, the nourishing and guarding Qi is disturbed, leading to abdominal fullness and sounds in the sides that chase each other. When Qi reaches the bladder, both the nourishing and guarding Qi are exhausted.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the Yang energy is blocked, the body becomes cold; when the Yin energy is blocked, there is pain in the bones. When Yang energy flows first, there is aversion to cold; when Yin energy flows first, there is numbness and paralysis. When Yin and Yang complement each other, their energies circulate. When the vital energy changes, it disperses. If it is full, energy is lost; if it is deficient, there is incontinence, termed the energy division. </p>
<p>In the Vomiting chapter: for dry vomiting and retching, or when hands and feet are cold, the tangerine peel decoction is the main treatment. </p>
<p>In the Diarrhea chapter: when the Qi of the six bowels is blocked externally, the hands and feet become cold, the upper body qi is tight, and the feet shrink; when the Qi of the five organs is blocked internally, diarrhea occurs without restraint, and in severe cases, the hands and feet become numb. </p>
<p>For diarrhea with cold hands and feet and no pulse, if moxibustion is applied and it does not warm, and the pulse does not return, accompanied by slight wheezing, it indicates death. The lesser Yin&#39;s resistance to the Yang is considered proper. </p>
<p>For diarrhea with clear fluids, there must be accompanied sweating and resolution; the patient must exhibit slight syncope, because their face is warm, indicating a deficiency below. </p>
<p>For diarrhea accompanied by a cessation of the pulse, cold hands and feet, if the pulse returns at a later stage and the hands and feet are warm, there is life; if the pulse does not return, it indicates death.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When yang qi ascends and does not descend, it is called &quot;contrary.&quot; When yin qi descends and does not ascend, it is also called &quot;contrary.&quot; When yang qi descends and does not ascend, it is called &quot;blocked,&quot; and when yin qi ascends and does not descend, it is also called &quot;blocked.&quot; &quot;Contrary and blocked&quot; refers to the inability of yin and yang to correspond with each other. When yang rushes above, it causes burning, leading to jaundice from the spleen and lungs, which manifests as a yellow-red color, arising from the extreme of yang. When yin runs below, it causes freezing, leading to cold extremities from the kidneys and liver, which presents as a green-black color, arising from the extreme of yin. Jaundice refers to yellow jaundice, and cold extremities refer to cold extremities due to the obstruction and non-communication of yin and yang. For yang&#39;s burning, treat with water; for yin&#39;s cold extremities, assist with fire; thus, it is the way of mutual support between yin and yang.</p>
<p>Regarding moxibustion, if one should administer it but does not, it results in cold extremities and reverses the flow.</p>
<p>For illnesses that warrant moxibustion, it opens the yin to connect with yang. Failing to perform moxibustion leads to heavy condensations of cold qi, toxic yin accumulating internally, qi of cold extremities surging upwards, creating separation and obliteration.</p>
<p>Concerning fatal pulses:</p>
<p>For conditions of cold extremities, if the pulse is floating, large, and short, it is fatal.<br>For cold extremities, if one calls but there is no response, and the pulse is absent, it is fatal.<br>For fullness in the cold extremities, if the pulse is long, it is fatal.<br>For cold extremities with sweating, if the pulse is weak and slow, it is fatal.</p>
<p>Pulse Classic by Wang Shuhe:</p>
<p>Regarding pulse methods:</p>
<p>For simultaneous deficiency of liver and gallbladder: if in the right hand at the pulse position both yin and yang are deficient, it indicates deficiency in the foot&#39;s lesser yin and lesser yang channels. The patient suffers from confusion and is unable to recognize people, has hallucinations, feels weak and cannot speak, and is often startled. The governing channel illness presents with a strong spine and cold extremities.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When entering, it is the yang riding on the yin. The symptoms include a cool body with cold limbs and a bad hot feeling, indicating external yin and internal yang; however, if one feels neither hot nor thirsty, that means both inside and outside are yin. Zhongjing states: if the cold is deep, the heat is also deep; if the cold is mild, the heat is mild too. Mouth sores that are rotten and red come from excessive sweating.</p>
<p><strong>On Yin and Yang, Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Intense yang leads to an intense yin, and an intense yin leads to an intense yang; this is the transformation of cold and heat. For instance, if the hands and feet are abnormally cold, accompanied by constipation and red urine, or black stool, with a pulse that is deep and slippery, this indicates a yang syndrome. For mild cases, use Baihu Decoction; for severe cases, use Chengqi Decoction. </p>
<p>In the case of cold damage and withdrawal, if blood and qi do not circulate, causing the limbs to become abnormally cold, this implies deep hidden heat, hence a deep state of cold. In such cases, urgently use a large dose of Chengqi Decoction with a supplementary laxative; immediate sweating will result. This aligns with Zhongjing&#39;s assertion that a cold state should be dealt with using laxatives. </p>
<p>Heat-induced cold (reversal of functions) is different from cold-induced cold. Heat-induced cold presents with slight reversal followed by fever. Conversely, in cold-induced cold, there is no fever but cold limbs with a greater feeling of chill, a deep and thin pulse, along with loose stools and urination. </p>
<p>Abnormal coldness in the hands and feet is referred to as &quot;reversal.&quot; Reversal indicates a lack of harmony between yin and yang, resulting in cold limbs. When yang energy weakens and yin energy strengthens, the yin prevails over the yang, causing the yang pulse to reverse and therefore blockage to the hands and feet, resulting in coldness.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of cold and heat in febrile diseases, when there is more cold and less heat, the illness is likely to recover; conversely, if there is more heat and less cold, the illness worsens. However, one must carefully distinguish between cold and heat-induced extremities. </p>
<p>Cold-induced extremities manifest as coldness in the limbs on the day of onset, with a pulse that is deep, weak, and not rapid. The feet often cramp, there is a preference for covering with clothing while lying down, a dislike for cold, or diarrhea with clear fluid, or a natural regulation of clear stools. Urination may be frequent, and external symptoms tend to be calm. If the pulse is deep and firm, but feels slow and weak upon pressure, it indicates cold-induced extremities. Appropriate remedies include Si Ni Decoction, Li Zhong Decoction, Tong Mai Si Ni Decoction, Dang Gui Si Ni Decoction, Dang Gui Si Ni with Fushen and Ginger Decoction, and Bai Tong with Pig Gall Bladder Decoction.</p>
<p>Heat-induced extremities, on the other hand, are characterized by fever and headache on the first day of illness, accompanied by other Yang symptoms. It typically takes two to five days for the extremities to become cold. In cases of mixed heat and cold extremities, cold will emerge within half a day, following the fever, as deep heat is necessary to induce extremities.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the fainting leads to fever, it is due to the slight heat. Although the pulse is deep and concealed, upon palpation it is slippery, indicating internal heat. The person may fear the heat, drink water, or wave their hands and feet, feeling restless and unable to sleep, with constipation and red urine, and showing signs of confusion. This indicates heat fainting, and remedies like Bai Hu and Cheng Qi should be used accordingly. Zhongjing says that in cases of chills and fever lasting one to five days, fainting must occur, and if there was prior fever, fainting will follow. The deeper the fainting, the deeper the heat; the milder the fainting, the milder the heat. If fainting that requires purging instead induces sweating, the mouth must be severely damaged and ulcerated. Additionally, if all symptoms are present with the four extremities feeling cold, it indicates blood and qi stagnation after purging, leading to coldness in the limbs. If the physician misidentifies this as a condition of yin, and administers heat-inducing drugs, disaster will follow swiftly. Generally, in heat fainting, the pulse must be deep and slippery, with sweat on the head; even if the hands are cold, the fingertips may occasionally feel warm, and one should promptly apply Cheng Qi Decoction without hesitation. Any cold in the extremities pertains to fainting due to yin, and must not be purged or induced to sweat.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a need for warmth in the extremities or signs of sweat, it indicates that although the hands and feet feel cold and may occasionally warm up, the palms must be warm; this is not true reversal. This should be monitored. If the patient experiences chills and fever with a pale complexion, is unwell, and suddenly has no pulse in both hands or one hand, it is likely due to a real exhaustion of sweat. One should extensively wrap the hands and feet in cotton clothing to keep them warm and urgently take a recipe such as Schisandra decoction, or possibly a combination of Ephedra, Asarum, and Licorice decoction. At that time, there will likely be a significant sweat leading to relief.</p>
<p>When evil qi is trapped in the chest, it can also cause cold extremities, but recognizing a pulse that suddenly becomes blocked is key. Zang-exhaustion is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Inquiring about the Shaoyin Four-Reversal Decoction and the Four-Reversal Powder, one might ask why there is a distinction. The answer is that, generally, in Shaoyin illness, one should not hastily use warming medicines. Although there may be a surface heat in Shaoyin disease, which Zhang Zhongjing termed late-onset fever, one can still use combinations like Ephedra and Asarum to induce sweating without turning it into a true Shaoyin syndrome. In today’s cases, when the extremities are cold but there is internal heat, Zhang Zhongjing recommends the Four-Reversal Powder. The Four-Reversal Decoction employs Aconite and Dried Ginger, while the Four-Reversal Powder focuses on reversing the cold from the extremities; patients might cough, feel palpitations, have difficulty urinating, experience abdominal pain, or suffer from diarrhea and heavy stools—all of these are signs of heat conditions.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fainting and Reversal</strong></p>
<p>The energy reverses and rushes upward due to the upward heat of fire. The bending and stretching are not convenient; thus, fainting and reversal are stubborn and fixed. The cold water (yin) leads to clarity, hence, when ill with cold, the limbs become cold and reverse, leading to a constraint that is solid and rigid, causing difficulty in stretching and bending. Therefore, in winter, the pulse is heavy, short, and firm, reflecting the symptoms of this illness. If an illness of cold is still mild and has not yet reached fainting and reversal, it cannot be mistaken for heat. Likewise, if there is severe heat leading to yang fainting, it should not be interpreted as cold. </p>
<p>For yin fainting, the original pulse and symptoms are all indicative of yin conditions: the body feels cool with no thirst, the pulse is slow, thin, and weak, with no evidence of yang conditions. For yang fainting, the original pulse and symptoms indicate yang conditions: extreme heat leads to reversal, and at times returns to warmth; even in fainting, there is agitation and thirst, with the body hot and pulse rapid. If yang fainting is very profound to the point of the body being cold with faint signs of a yin pulse that seems about to cease, it merely indicates extreme heat leading to a desire for death.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The common people mistakenly believe that transformation into a Yin disease occurs, claiming that the interplay of Yin and Yang, heat and cold, is unpredictable. They uphold the notion that Yang is associated with life while Yin corresponds to death, urgently applying fire and warming herbs to stimulate the surface and internal warmth, thus supporting Yang energy, resulting in a survival rate of one in ten. This leads to a widespread fear of Yin conditions, causing those with suspected Yin diseases to be urgently warmed, out of fear that failure to act will invite misfortune. Yet they overlook that those with severe heat illnesses rarely escape this condition. </p>
<p>They are unaware that the balance of Yin and Yang is what constitutes the Dao, while excess Yin or Yang results in illness. Yin and Yang achieve harmony through balance; imbalance causes disease. All things arise from the combination of Yin and Yang; therefore, excessive Yin cannot persist, and isolated Yang cannot thrive. When Yang energy is excessively strong and Yin energy is excessively weak, Yang becomes stagnant, leading to a tilt between Yin and Yang that prevents circulation. This results in cold extremities, known as Yang collapse. Thus, Zhang Zhongjing stated: &quot;When heat is profound, the collapse is likewise profound; when heat is slight, the collapse is slight.&quot; He also noted: &quot;Collapse should be addressed from below; once the heat inside is eliminated, the collapse will improve.&quot;<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, when the disease heat is severe, there is a corresponding coldness. Moreover, if there is loss of lower energy, the heat worsens and manifests as a yin condition, not a transformation into a cold disease. The transmission and transformation of disease refer to the flow of pathological factors affecting the internal and external, upper and lower pathways of the body, rather than a mere reversal between cold and heat or yin and yang. The principle states: when yin and yang are balanced, there is harmony; when imbalanced, there is disease. For example, if yang is strong and yin is weak leading to heat, should it really transform into cold, it would be like when heat dissipates and cold arises, resulting in a balance of yin and yang which should lead to recovery. How could it become a cold disease? Although the discussion on malaria mentions that when yin prevails there is cold, and when yang prevails there is heat, it means that when interior energy and external heat are combined, there is yang predominance leading to fever; and when external energy and heat are combined, there is yin predominance leading to cold shivering. Due to superficial energy being weak and interior energy being hot, excess can be harmful, so counteractions are needed, hence the shivering. In general, it fundamentally stems from heat, not a cold disease.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of cold damage with alternating chills and fever, if the evil heat is superficial, it obstructs the right qi, hence the aversion to cold; if the evil heat is deep within, the evil is severe and unrestrained, leading to a disfavor of cold while the aversion turns toward heat. The interplay of exterior and interior continues, resulting in the alternation of chills and fever. This condition does not unify between exterior and interior, hence it differs from malaria where the chills and fever are mild; they arise from the transmission of heat to yin and yang on the surface, rather than a change in the yin and yang of the disease itself. Sometimes, if the disease is heat and the cold attack is excessive, the yang qi becomes weakened and yin qi increases excessively, leading to a subsequent condition of cold; this arises from overdosing on medication rather than natural fluctuations of cold and heat.</p>
<p>When the six qi become chaotic and manifest as disease, they do so by combining and coexisting as one illness. Wind, heat, and dryness often combine together, as do cold and dampness; however, it is rare for dissimilar natures to combine. When there is severe control leading to a combination, it is a manifestation of deficiency. For instance, when fire heat is extreme and water is used to control it, it may result in shivering; generally, this is due to excessive heat rather than cold qi, thus thirst arises indicating heat within, while shivering causes the desire to drink cold. Similarly, when fire refines metal and the heat is extreme leading to transformation into water, even though it becomes water, it is still fundamentally due to intense heat resulting in the essence of metal.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

Attempting to quench thirst by drinking more water leads to increased fullness and pain and worsens the vomiting, yet the thirst remains unquenched. If one refrains from drinking, the unbearable thirst creates restlessness and distress, making one wish for death.

<p>In such cases, we typically administer Da Chengqi Decoction hot to facilitate swallowing, which can relieve the stagnation in the intestines and stomach.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When it reaches the extreme, the body becomes cold and the pulse weakens, resembling symptoms of yin conditions, leading to a pulse cessation and death. Therefore, when a yang illness exhibits a yin pulse, it indicates the pulse is nearly gone, suggesting a fatal condition. Even if the illness is intensely hot, if it persists, there must be cold extremities and a weak pulse, eventually resulting in a cold body and pulse cessation followed by death. This could arise from the illness initially being too hot, from excessive treatment leading to worsening symptoms, from a loss of cold medicine for regulation, from improper treatment methods, or from mistakenly taking hot medicine or applying excessive heat, resulting in extreme heat causing yang collapse. In such cases, administering cold medicines like the Chaihu Decoction can reduce the heat and restore the balance, alleviating the collapse. It is crucial to avoid using harmful hot and toxic drugs like silver powder or croton seeds, as they will deplete yin energy and exhaust body fluids, exacerbating dry heat and causing serious complications such as breathlessness, abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, blood overflow, or various heat transformation symptoms. Such remedies are intended for breaking up hard accumulations, not for addressing heat or nourishing yin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There was a case of excess yang where the person did not improve, resulting in a cold body and weak pulse, resembling a condition of yin. Mistakenly, hot medicines were administered, worsening the condition to the point that the body was cold, the pulse was weak and almost absent, with only a slight warmth in the chest and heart, leading to faintness and confusion, making the patient unable to speak. The doctor intended to use warming medicines to urgently revive the yang, fearing the disappearance of yang would lead to death. However, they did not realize this was caused by excessive heat disrupting the downward flow, and subsequently supplementing warmth exacerbated the issue. If more hot medicines were used to support the yang energy, the yin would suddenly deplete, resulting in the death of the yang energy as well; where would the yang energy be generated from then?</p>
<p>Some might ask: Why not urgently promote a downward flow? The answer is that if the yang is excessive and attacks the yin, leading the yin to deplete first, the yang will also be exhausted. At this moment, if one attempts to induce a downward flow, both yin and yang would cease, resulting in immediate death; thus, neglecting the situation would also lead to death. However, if the condition reaches a certain point, a gentle intervention can save them; in this case, one should use cold medicines to nourish the yin and slightly reduce the yang, making sure there is no violent purging. If the yin energy can gradually recover, salvation is possible. It is advisable to use a cooling remedy, as this can encourage the gradual recovery of yin energy. How can this be determined?

<p>Generally, when treating illness, it is essential to clarify the root and the branch. The branch is the initial symptom, while the root is the fundamental cause. Thus, the classics say that the initial illness is the root and subsequent illness is the branch; the root and branch are interrelated, and treatment should first address the urgent symptoms. It is also said that the six qi serve as the root, while the three yin and three yang are branches; thus, the pathogenic qi is the root, while the affected meridians and organs are branches. The subtlety of root and branch, treating them accordingly cannot be overlooked. Hence, the classics state that knowing what opposes and aligns is crucial; when the appropriate course is taken, there are no gaps.</p>
<p>To clearly understand root and branch ensures that all measures are apt. Ignorance of root and branch is called acting blindly. The interplay of yin and yang, and the relationship between root and branch is the pathway to knowledge. Is this not its principle? </p>
<p>In cases of one yang and one yin, if illness manifests with fright, back pain, and sighing, it is termed wind reversal.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Huang Liao</strong><br><strong>(By Jin Cheng Wuji)</strong>  </p>
<p>What explains the situation of the Four Reverses in Cold Damage? The &quot;Four Reverses&quot; refers to the limbs being reversed and not warm. Accumulated cold leads to coldness and accumulated warmth leads to heat; these conditions do not arise in just a day or night, but develop gradually over time. When Cold Damage first occurs, the evil is present in the skin. When the taiyang and yangming channels are affected, the whole body will feel hot; when the shaoyin and taiyin channels are impacted, the hands and feet will feel warm on their own, indicating the exterior evil has become milder and wishes to transmit inward. The classic states: &quot;In the case of Cold Damage, if after four or five days the hands and feet are warm and thirst arises, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be administered.&quot; This indicates that the evil in the taiyang has transmitted to the shaoyang. When the pulse is superficial and the hands and feet are warm on their own, it shows the condition is associated with the taiyin, meaning the shaoyang evil has transmitted to the taiyin. It is understood that when the evil energy is halfway between the exterior and interior, the hands and feet do not feel hot but remain warm. When the evil transmits to the shaoyin, it indicates that the interior condition is severe; even though it has not yet manifested as cold extremities, the hands and feet become even less warm, which is identified as the Four Reverses. If it reaches the jueyin stage, the hands and feet will feel cold.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Classic text states: When a person has a condition characterized by cold limbs—whether by coughing, palpitations, difficulty urinating, abdominal pain, or severe diarrhea—this is diagnosed as a &quot;Four Reversals&quot; condition. The treatment is &quot;Four Reversal Powder,&quot; which consists of four ingredients: Chai Hu, Zhi Shi, Shao Yao, and Gan Cao. All of these are cold in nature yet specifically treat the Four Reversal illness, indicating that this condition is not merely a sign of excessive coldness. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are also &quot;Four Reversal Decoctions&quot; which treat the coldness in the hands and feet using warming herbs like Gan Jiang and Fu Zi, which is very effective against the illness. If the hands and feet generate warmth but then turn cold, this condition is caused by an internal disturbance, and the &quot;Four Reversal Powder&quot; shall treat it. If one begins to experience chilly hands and feet that do not warm up, this indicates that the Yin channels are afflicted and Yang Qi is insufficient; &quot;Four Reversal Decoction&quot; can be used to warm it. </p>
<p>It is crucial to recognize this to avoid misunderstandings. The conditions of Four Reversals and cold extremities are similar but not the same. The text states: &quot;Any severe case of Four Reversal cold should not be treated as diarrhea,&quot; indicating that Four Reversals and cold are distinctly different. Severe symptoms accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, and irritability suggest serious danger in the case of Four Reversals. Diagnosis should be conducted with care and thoroughness! </p>
<p>Regarding cold in febrile diseases, how can it be clarified? Cold indicates a worse condition than Four Reversals.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that when the yang energy sinks inward and the heat energy reverses and stagnates, the hands and feet become cold. The classics state that if one has a cold damage for one or two days and experiences reversal after four or five days, then fever must arise. The previous heat will inevitably be followed by reversal. The deeper the reversal, the deeper the heat; the milder the reversal, the milder the heat. Thus, it is known that when there is sinking inward, the hands and feet are in reversal. In lesser yin diseases, there is only reversal without sweating, and if one forces sweating, it will certainly move the blood, but one does not know through which channel it will exit, either through the mouth and nose or from the eyes. This is termed &quot;lower reversal with upper exhaustion,&quot; and it also refers to activating the heat. If the fever comes first and is followed by reversal, it means the heat is hidden within; if reversal comes first and is followed by fever, it means the yin has receded and the yang energy has recovered. If one initially experiences reversal, it signifies that the yang energy is insufficient while the yin energy is dominant. Generally, reversal is governed by the yin, and cold is prevalent, with distinctions of progress and retreat. The classic states: If one has reversal for five days, there will also be heat for five days. If after six days there is no reversal, recovery will occur. If fever lasts for four days and reversal lasts for three days, recovery will ensue if fever returns for four days with minimal reversal and much heat. If there is reversal for four days, fever for three days, followed by reversal for five days, the condition progresses.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When cold is abundant and heat is scarce, it indicates the retreat of yang energy, thus leading to progression. If illness reaches the Jueyin, the meridians are completely exhausted. At such a time, yang energy prevails over yin; hence, there is little cold and much heat, and the illness improves. However, if yin energy exceeds, and yang cannot recover, there will be much cold and little heat, causing the illness to reverse. Cold is the arrival of yin energy, while heat represents the recovery of yang energy. When it comes to diarrhea, it is said that there will be cold first, then heat will emerge, and the diarrhea will surely stop, indicating that the cold must recover leading to the cessation of diarrhea. Cold is the manifestation of heat, as yang energy recovers, leading to the inevitable cessation of diarrhea. Heat, in turn, signifies the return of cold, implying that yin energy is once again prevailing, thus causing the recurrence of diarrhea. </p>
<p>The yang energies reside within the chest; when evil energies reside in the chest, stagnation occurs, preventing yang energy from dispersing, leading to coldness in the hands and feet. The texts state: &quot;When there is cold in the hands and feet, the pulse is intermittently tense, evil is obstructed in the chest, the heart feels full and distressed, and hunger does not allow for eating; illness in the chest should be expelled.&quot; This is the manifestation of excessive yin. If there is even worse cold leading to curling up, the yin energy is extremely strong and difficult to control. The texts say: &quot;In lesser yin disorders, if there is aversion to cold, curling of the body, diarrhea, and cold in the hands and feet, it is untreatable.&quot; This indicates that cold is a reversal; can divine elixirs create life?<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Confucian Attitude Towards Parents</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Condition of Syncope in Recent Times</strong> </p>
<p>Syncope describes a state where the hands and feet, as well as below the knees, can feel either cold or hot. The world generally holds that &quot;kicking leg disease&quot; is an ailment caused by cold and dampness, yet &quot;The Internal Classic&quot; does not mention this condition. Wang Taifu also stated that there was originally no such disease; it was later defined by &quot;The Book of Broad Treatments.&quot; In ancient texts, what we call &quot;kicking leg disease&quot; refers to the condition of syncope. However, syncope should be differentiated into two types, which are then subdivided into five organ categories. The two types are cold syncope and hot syncope. When yang energy is weak below, it leads to cold syncope; when yin energy is weak below, it results in hot syncope. Hot syncope manifests as hot hands and feet, while cold syncope manifests as cold hands and feet. Yang meridians originate from the surface of the toes, while yin meridians begin from the soles of the feet. When yang energy is strong, there is heat in the lower parts; when yin energy is strong, there is cold. Furthermore, it’s said that yang governs the exterior and syncope occurs in the interior, while yin governs the interior and syncope occurs in the exterior. This is because the energies of yin and yang are reversed and move upwards. In spring and summer, yang is abundant and yin is scarce; in autumn and winter, yin strengthens and yang weakens. People may rely on their vigor and indulge during autumn and winter, leading to a depletion of internal yang and a surplus of essence that flows downward, allowing evil energy to rise. When yang energy declines, true essence is also exhausted, which causes the body not to nourish; thus, yin energy operates alone, resulting in cold hands and feet, which is classified as cold syncope.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person enters a room drunk and full, the energy accumulates in the spleen and stomach, dominating the flow of fluids. If the yin energy is weak and the yang energy enters, the stomach becomes unbalanced. If the stomach is unbalanced, the essence and vitality wither, and when the essence withers, the limbs are not nourished. The effects of alcohol and food gas combine to create internal heat, leading to red urine; the energy becomes robust yet reckless. When the kidney energy is weakened and yang energy prevails alone, the hands and feet become hot and lead to heat syncope. </p>
<p>There is also syncope that causes a person to feel abdominal fullness without awareness; some may regain awareness after one or two days, while others may suddenly become confused and lose consciousness, all due to chaos caused by external pathogens and rebellious yang energy, leading to insufficient motion in the shaoyin kidney meridian. When the kidney energy is minimal, the essence and blood scatter, forcing energy upwards into the chest cavity where the ancestral energy stagnates beneath the heart, and yang energy retreats downwards. The heat returns to the yin lower regions, assisting the yin and causing loss of sensation in the body. </p>
<p>Moreover, the five vessels converge in the ears; if all five are blocked, it causes bodily pulses to stir while the form remains oblivious, resembling a corpse, hence it is called corpse syncope. There may be drooling like a dragging saw, with sounds in the throat representing phlegm syncope. Twitching of the hands and feet indicates wind syncope. If this occurs due to intoxication, it is called alcohol syncope; if from sudden anger, it is termed qi syncope. Bone pain and nail brittleness represent bone syncope. Sudden cramping and inability to flex or extend the toes signify arm syncope. A body that is rigid like a plank represents liver syncope. Shortness of breath and lamentation, accompanied by frantic running or climbing, correspond to yangming syncope.

       Differentiation of Jue in Shao Han Si Ni

 Cheng WujI noted in his commentary on &quot;On Cold Damage&quot; that Si Ni refers to the coldness of the four limbs. Jue signifies cold hands and feet. When the cold pathogen affects the three Yang channels, the hands and feet are bound to feel hot; when it reaches the Tai Yin channel, the hands and feet will self-warm; but when it descends to the Shao Yin, the pathogen&#39;s heat intensifies, resulting in coldness of the four limbs, leading to even greater Jue. The classics state: in Shao Yin disease with Si Ni, a person may cough, experience palpitations, have difficulty urinating, suffer abdominal pain, or endure severe diarrhea. The treatment for Si Ni should use Si Ni San, which consists of Chai Hu, Zhi Shi, Shao Yao, and Gan Cao, all of which are cold substances specifically targeting the Si Ni condition, indicating that Si Ni is not solely a manifestation of empty cold. Si Ni and Jue are similar but distinct. The classics further state: various manifestations of Si Ni and Jue should not be treated with purgation, illustrating the differences between Si Ni and Jue.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ah! This statement! Is it not supposed to indicate something very close to reason yet very confusing in truth? I have attempted to examine it; the words of Zhongjing regarding &quot;sijue&quot; and &quot;jue&quot; are not the same: some say &quot;sijue,&quot; some say &quot;jue,&quot; some say &quot;jue逆,&quot; some say &quot;jue冷,&quot; some say &quot;jue寒,&quot; some say &quot;hands and feet reverse cold,&quot; some say &quot;hands and feet jue逆,&quot; some say &quot;hands and feet jue冷,&quot; or &quot;hands and feet jue逆冷.&quot; Upon detailed examination, they all refer to cold. Therefore, the two words &quot;jue逆&quot; are often used interchangeably, and there has never been a distinction made where &quot;逆&quot; denotes warmth and &quot;厥&quot; denotes cold. However, the limbs and hands and feet should be distinguished. The addition of the character &quot;四&quot; (four) before &quot;逆&quot; refers broadly to general coldness in the hands and feet, while the addition of &quot;手足&quot; (hands and feet) to &quot;jue逆,&quot; &quot;jue冷,&quot; etc., refers specifically to hands and feet. Whenit states &quot;not warm,&quot; it indicates cold; what difference could there be? What Zhongjing refers to as various &quot;sijue&quot; and &quot;jue&quot; should not be mistaken for being treated differently; &quot;sijue&quot; denotes general cold in the four limbs and &quot;jue&quot; refers specifically to the cold in the hands and feet, while the arms and legs above are not cold. It does not imply there is a distinction between &quot;逆&quot; and &quot;厥&quot; regarding warmth and cold. Therefore, it is stated that &quot;jue&quot; means hands and feet reverse cold. This explains that &quot;逆冷&quot; and &quot;厥&quot; convey the same meaning; thus, &quot;逆&quot; is equivalent to &quot;厥,&quot; and &quot;厥&quot; to &quot;逆.&quot; Hence, the dictionaries state: &quot;厥&quot; means &quot;逆.&quot;<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although both types of counterflow are associated with cold, there are distinctions between yin and yang. When heat reaches its extreme and leads to counterflow, yang resembles yin; when cold reaches its extreme and leads to counterflow, there is only yin without yang. When yang resembles yin, one must use cold herbs; when there is only yin without yang, one must use hot herbs. Zhongjing treated the condition of four reversals with cold herbs using Si Ni San, which addresses the case where yang resembles yin. For those who do not use the hot herbs in Si Ni Tang to treat the four reversals, how can they be sure that it is not due to a loss of original balance? Moreover, the name &quot;Si Ni Tang&quot; derives from the coldness in the four limbs. Now, using Si Ni Tang to treat the cold hands and feet, is it not essentially the same as counterflow? Since &quot;Si Ni&quot; indicates the limbs are cold, and &quot;counterflow&quot; refers to hands and feet being particularly cold, why then is the medicine for counterflow not named &quot;Si Jue Tang&quot;? Cheng proposed in the context of treating four reversals that the condition is due to heat evil, and he also stated in the &quot;Ming Li Lun&quot; that four reversals are not signs of mere cold deficiency.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the death signs in Shaoyin disease mentioned in the two sections below, it states that the condition of Sini (four reversals) indicates severe cold. If this is the case, can it not contradict its own argument? It is understood that Sini is similar to the condition of extremities being cold or hot, and it cannot be said that Sini is solely caused by evil heat. However, if all four limbs are uniformly cold, compared to just the hands and feet being cold, there is a difference. Thus, Zhongjing said: In Shaoyin disease, those who have vomiting, diarrhea, agitation, and Sini are to die. He also said: In Shaoyin disease, if there is Sini with aversion to cold, the body curled up, the pulse not present, and no agitation but restlessness, they will die. He further stated: In Shaoyin disease, if there is vomiting, diarrhea, and coldness in the hands and feet, with restlessness and a desire to die, Wuzhuyu decoction is the main treatment. Among these three statements, two indicate death and one indicates treatability; although they manifest through various symptoms, the death cases are described with Sini, while the treatable case refers to the coldness in the extremities. This shows a distinction in severity between Sini and the coldness of the hands and feet. If all four limbs are uniformly cold, the condition is severe; whereas if only the hands and feet are cold, the condition is light. Even women and children can understand this. Cheng argues, how can the condition of extremities be worse than the reversals? If one can understand the differences between Sini and the coldness of the extremities, it is evident that Sini refers specifically to the hands and feet, while the former encompasses the arms, legs, and above. Thus, it is unnecessary to create convoluted explanations about warmth and cold, and clarity will naturally be achieved.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Reversal of Extremities</strong>  </p>
<p>Reversal of extremities refers to the hands and feet becoming cold due to reversed qi and blood. This condition mainly arises from qi deficiency, but can also be due to blood deficiency. In qi deficiency, the pulse is thin; in blood deficiency, the pulse is large. During heat reversal, the pulse is rapid; with external pathogens, the pulse is deep and strong; with phlegm, the pulse is wiry. For phlegm, use Atractylodes and bamboo sap; for qi deficiency, the Four Gentlemen Decoction; for blood deficiency, the Four Substances Decoction; for heat reversal, use the Major Order Decoction; for external pathogens, use the Double Relief Powder with ginger juice and wine. There are also yin reversal and yang reversal: when yin declines below, it causes heat; when yang declines below, it causes cold. Additionally, if there is numbness in the hands and feet, it indicates qi deficiency; if the hands and feet are stiff, it pertains to damp phlegm and stagnant blood; numbness in all ten fingers indicates damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach. </p>
<p>Reversal signifies severity, brevity, and opposition, where the hands and feet feel cold and reversed. The symptoms vary widely, and the methods for dispersing them are numerous; here, I will briefly summarize. For example, in cases of cold and heat reversal, it represents the dual reversals of yin and yang. Yang reversal occurs when heat is deep, as excessive yang leads to reversal; one must not treat this as a yin condition with heat remedies, as it could result in the spirit and essence being extinguished, leading to death. Urgently apply the Major and Minor Order Decoctions, adapting to the severity of the case.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>&quot;Shi Jue&quot;, &quot;Fei Shi&quot;, and &quot;Zuo Jue&quot; are symptoms that suggest a serious condition caused by invasion of malevolent qi. It can happen suddenly and may cause coldness in the hands and feet, the skin can become bumpy, the face may turn dark, the spirit may be disturbed, and the person could speak nonsensically, tighten their jaws, or become unconscious and disoriented. These symptoms may arise after exposure to funerals, entering temples, or ascending graves. Administer Su He Wan; if there is slight recovery, follow with Qiao Qi San or Ping Wei San, known as the Qi Regulation and Stomach Peace Powder.</p>
<p>&quot;Phlegm Jue&quot; occurs due to cold phlegm causing blockage, resulting in cold limbs. Ginger and Fu Zi Decoction is recommended, using raw Fu Zi instead of cooked.</p>
<p>&quot;Tai Jue&quot; results from cold in the stomach. The text states that &quot;Tai&quot; refers to a long worm. Coldness in the stomach can lead to the expulsion of tapeworms.

<p>&quot;Qi Jue&quot; is similar to a stroke. How does one distinguish between them? In a wind stroke, the body feels warm, while with Qi Jue, the body feels cold.

<p>When the yang is reversed, the hands and feet may feel cold, though at times they may be warm; the palms and soles will surely feel warm. The pulse may be deep and hidden, but upon pressing, it is slippery. Symptoms may include a fear of heat, thirst for water, restlessness with the desire to toss and turn, difficulty sleeping, constipation, and red urine. This condition is called heat reversal, which the ancients referred to as yang reaching its extreme and then reversing. For treatment, one can use Bai Hu Decoction, Da Cheng Qi Decoction, Shuang Jie San, and Liang Ge San, carefully selecting based on the severity of symptoms.</p>
<p>In contrast, for yin reversal, the limbs are cold, the body is not hot, there may be nausea, curling of the feet while lying down, or the inclination to cover oneself with clothes or blankets. There is often no thirst or diarrhea, or normal bowel movements may occur; the pulse is deep, faint, and not rapid; although it may be deep and solid, it is slow and weak upon palpation. This condition is called cold reversal. For treatment, one can use Tong Mai Si Ni Decoction, or Dang Gui Si Ni Decoction, or Bai Tong with pig gallbladder juice.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In the section on Qi Counterflow from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: Counterflow is a reverse of Qi. Any shift from cold to heat, or if heat is deeply rooted and causes trembling, or if there is excessive cold leading to agitation, are all termed as counterflow, not limited to just cold hands and feet. The zong muscle corresponds to the yin vessels, with the liver and spleen meridians closely associated with the zong muscle. In cold counterflow, the yin contracts and the limbs are cold; in heat counterflow, the fluids dry up and fail to nourish the limbs, resulting in red urine and hot hands and feet. Thus, the counterflow of the six meridians is all unified under the liver and spleen. When the pathogenic factor from cold damage affects the three yang meridians, the limbs feel warm. If it’s half exterior and half interior, affecting the taiyin, the pathogen gradually penetrates inward, making the limbs warm. If it reaches the shaoyin counterflow, the pathogen enters deeply and remains embedded internally, leading to cold limbs. However, if heat leads to counterflow, it is heat counterflow through the channels, where mild cases can be treated with formulas like Si Ni San, Bai Hu Tang, or Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang, and severe cases may require Da Chai Hu Cheng Qi Decoction. If the pathogen abruptly clogs the chest, causing restlessness and lack of appetite along with counterflow, Guati San can help expel it.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Bai Wen,&quot; heat counterflow and cold counterflow are different. Heat counterflow is when there is mild counterflow alongside fever. In contrast, cold counterflow presents without fever, with cold limbs, a deep and thin pulse, loose stools, aversion to cold, and blue-tinted nails. Additionally, if there is failure to descend, resulting in blocked blood flow with cold limbs leading to counterflow, a physician might misinterpret it as yin counterflow, leading to disastrous consequences if treated with formulas for counterflow like Si Ni. Generally, heat counterflow has a deep and slippery pulse, sweat on the forehead, warm palms, and warm fingertips, and is appropriately treated with downward actions. This is the subtle intention of Zhongjing.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Hui Jue</p>
<p>The term &quot;Hui&quot; refers to the roundworm, and it is also called &quot;Jue.&quot; This condition belongs to the Jue Yin category of diseases, characterized by the extremities being cold and reversed. Patients typically have a history of consuming roundworms, or it may be due to illness and excessive hunger, where the worms ascend to the throat. If one excessively sweats, this leads to stomach coldness, allowing the worms to rise and attack the throat, causing a deficiency of stomach qi, resulting in an inability to eat even when hungry. When a person eats, if they vomit up the worms, it is because the worms detect the smell of food and emerge. </p>
<p>Externally, symptoms may fluctuate between calmness and agitation, indicating that the worms may be either active or at rest. There may also be diarrhea due to cold in the internal organs, which causes the worms to move upward into the throat. Thus, when the upper part of the body is hot while the middle and lower parts are cold, symptoms of agitation, heat, and thirst may arise, accompanied by constipation. It is unwise to quickly use cooling medicines in this case. One should first use Wu Mei pills or Li Zhong Decoction to calm the roundworms, and then adjust treatment according to the symptoms. If agitation and heat persist, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may be used. If there is significant heat, confusion, abdominal distension, constipation, or if the roundworms are restless and expelled with bowel movements, then Da Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yin Jue</strong></p>
<p>Yin Jue refers to a condition where there is no headache, no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea before the onset of the attack, and there is a lack of thirst and a tendency to curl up; this occurs because the Yin pathogenic factor is predominant. The hands and feet are extremely cold, and this is governed by the Jue Yin, as the interaction of Yin and Yang qi does not harmonize, which is different from the gradual cooling seen in Sì Nì (Four Reverses). In cases of Tài Yīn Jue, where the hands and feet are slightly cold, the remedy is Lǐ Zhōng Tānɡ. In Shào Yīn Jue, if the shins are cold and the feet are cold, and if severe, the hands and arms are cold up to the knees; the remedies are Sì Nì Tāng or Tōnɡ Mài Sì Nì Tāng. In Jue Yīn Jue, if the entire body is cold, the appropriate remedy is Dāng Guī Sì Nì Tāng. If there is agitation and counterflow, it should not be treated. According to “Bǎi Wèn,” cold Jue initially presents with coldness in the limbs, a submerged and thin pulse, and restless legs while lying down, possibly accompanied by aversion to cold, bluish nails, self-covering with clothing, or clear diarrhea, or self-regulating clear stools, frequent urination, and external symptoms of clarity; this is cold Jue, for which Sì Nì Tāng or Sān Wèi Shēn Yú Tāng can be chosen. Generally, conditions with more heat and less Jue are easier to treat, while more Jue and less heat are harder to remedy. There is also blood Jue, treated with Sì Wù Tāng; qi Jue with Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng; summer Jue with Bái Hǔ Tāng; water Jue presents as palpitations below the heart, treated with Fú Líng Guì Gān Tāng; corpse Jue occurs due to toxin, caused by the offensive and improper atmosphere, and is treated with Mù Xiāng Yūn Qì Sǎn combined with Píng Wèi Sǎn or Zhuī Hūn Tāng.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yang Jue</p>
<p>Yang jue refers to the condition where, before the onset of a fit, there are symptoms such as headache, body heat, profuse sweating, constipation, thirst, and delirium. When the pathogen deeply infiltrates, it hides within and then leads to the fit. After a slight fit, within half a day, there is a recurrence of heat. If the heat descends, it results in abdominal pain, diarrhea with a feeling of heaviness, producing thick, sticky yellowish-red stools, likely containing pus and blood. If there is no blood in the stools, but heat rises, it will lead to a sore throat. Additionally, if the heat-induced fit persists for seven days without relief, there will inevitably be pus and blood in the stools. In the case of Yin jue, the symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea with clear stools, and not feeling thirsty; this reflects the specific nature of Yin jue, so one should refer back to the discussion on Yang jue.</p>
<p>External Invasion of Cold and Heat</p>
<p>Cold leading to blood and subsequent fits, with a pulse that is deep and weak, should be treated with Li Zhong Decoction or Si Ni Decoction. Heat that exhausts qi leading to fits, with a weak pulse, should be treated with Bai Hu Decoction or a modified Xiao Feng San with Qiang Huo. In summer, if labor commences which disturbs Yang Qi, leading to symptoms such as blindness and deafness, the Inner Canon refers to this as &quot;boiling fit,&quot; indicating the heat forces damaging the kidneys and bladder. The appropriate treatment is Si Jun Zi Decoction, plus Yuan Zhi, Fang Feng, Chi Shao, Mai Men Dong, and Chen Pi. For any external causes leading to fits, it is advisable to add ginger juice to the dispersing medicines.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Internal Injuries from the Seven Emotions</h3>
<p>Internal causes of injuries from joy and anger harm the qi and impair aspiration. When qi reverses and does not flow downwards, blood accumulates in the heart and chest. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; refers to this as “slight collapse,” indicating an imbalance of yin and yang leading to turbulent qi and blood. In cases of severe cold from reversed qi, &quot;Suhexiang Pills&quot; and &quot;Eight Flavor Releasing Qi Powder&quot; can be applied. If anger causes intense reversal, resulting in vomiting blood or nosebleeds leading to collapse, modifications to &quot;Four Substances Decoction&quot; are made by removing Rehmannia and adding Red Poria, Ginseng, Platycodon, Aged Tangerine Peel, Ophiopogon, and Areca Nut, to be taken with ginger decoction, or &quot;Six Depression Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>For abundant anger causing sudden shouting and collapse, phlegm is blocking upwards while fire rises from below, hence the use of five qian of Cyperus, seven qian of Chuanxiong, and three qian of fresh Licorice, boiled in the urine of children with ginger juice. Additionally, Qingdai (Indigo) and Human Zhongbai along with Cyperus made into pills may provide some relief, combined with &quot;Phlegm Releasing Decoction&quot; plus Huanglian and Cyperus, or swallowing &quot;Angelica Dragon and Honey Pills.&quot;</p>
<p>Injuries from labor, drinking, or being startled causing collapse can be treated with &quot;Six Gentlemen Decoction&quot; adding Qin, Lian, Bamboo Juice, and ginger juice. </p>
<p>For internal injuries from phlegm-fire leading to collapse, a wiry and slippery pulse indicates the use of &quot;Erchen Decoction&quot; with Bamboo Juice. If there’s a cold condition, add fresh Aconite; if there’s a fiery condition, add Qin, Lian, Mountain Gardenia, and Bamboo Juice; for overweight individuals, add Ginseng and ginger juice. </p>
<p>All forms of collapse can result in dizziness, fainting spells, hallucinations, or abdominal distension with difficulty in urination and defecation, or vomiting or heart pain, all indicative of phlegm-fire obstructing qi.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zang Jue</strong></p>
<p>Fever lasting seven to eight days, pulse thin, skin cold and restlessness, with vomiting or diarrhea, and no brief relief at any time—this is the true Qi of the Zang Yin exhausted, hence called Zang Jue. Zhongjing has no treatment, only the use of Si Ni Tang and cold drinks to rescue. In cases of Shao Yin Jue with vomiting, diarrhea, and restlessness, this is also not treated, but rescued with San Wei Shen Yu Tang.</p>
<p><strong>Caused by Alcohol and Lust</strong></p>
<p>Heat Jue occurs from excess drinking and indulgence, resulting in dampness stagnating in the Spleen Earth, unable to nourish the four limbs. Yang Qi is alone strong, thus causing palms and soles to feel hot. For this, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, Sheng Yang San Huo Tang, or Huo Yu Tang. </p>
<p>Cold Jue occurs from excessive desires draining essence, severely damaging the Yuan Yang, unable to nourish the meridians, with Yin Qi predominating, hence all limbs feel cold. For this, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Fu Zi, or Dang Gui Si Ni Tang. </p>
<p>When ordinary Qi deficiency causes Jue, use Si Jun Zi Tang; for blood deficiency Jue, use Si Wu Tang. If there is heat, add Zhi Mu or Huang Bai; if there is deficiency-cold, add Fu Zi. However, cold Jue often arises from being overpowered. For example, if Kidney cold invades the Spleen, it leads to cold Jue; if Heart heat invades the Kidney, it leads to heat Jue—this applies across the Six Meridians. </p>
<p>In acute discussions, Yang signs include thirst, delirium, and body heat; Yin signs show no thirst, lethargy, and coolness. This is similar to Yang Jue and Yin Jue in febrile diseases. Yet, mixed diseases often originate from alcohol, lust, and emotional disturbances, with few from external pathogens. Thus it is said that when Yang declines above, it causes cold Jue; when Yin declines below, it causes heat Jue. Yang extremes resemble Yin, and Yin extremes resemble Yang. Although the causes of febrile diseases differ, the variations in symptoms are also similar.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Corpse Stiffness</strong> </p>
<p>When one encounters a case of hanging or a disease related to death, or enters a temple and ascends a tomb, if suddenly afflicted by external evil influences, and faces opposition from internal toxicities, the qi becomes obstructed and fails to circulate; the meridians and pulse are suppressed, leading to confusion and loss of awareness. Suddenly, the hands and feet become cold, the face turns dark blue, the jaw tightens, and one may faint abruptly, possibly speaking nonsensically. It is critical not to treat this as a form of wind illness. First, administer the Suhexiang pill to awaken the patient; once they regain consciousness, use a combination of mukxiang and Pingwei powder to harmonize and adjust the qi. </p>
<p>For those who are fundamentally weak, use five qian of sulfur and two qian of nitre, ground together into powder, and administer three doses prepared with a cup of aged wine, ensuring the sulfur is activated before pouring it into the cup to be taken warm, similar to a person walking five li and then taking another dose. If the previous medicines are unavailable, use the Ginseng and Aconite Decoction mixed with ginger juice and wine instead. Externally, perform moxibustion on the Baihui point with moxa the size of a mung bean for nine applications, and on the Qihai point for a hundred applications; if the body is warm, there&#39;s a chance for recovery. </p>
<p>For those who died suddenly, administer the Chasing Soul Decoction. </p>
<p><strong>Treatment principles</strong>: </p>
<p>When the yin and yang qi do not connect, it results in stiffness. For heat-induced stiffness, tonify the yin; for cold-induced stiffness, tonify the yang. The standard meridians indicate that supporting the dominant water calms the yang light, while enriching the source of fire dissipates the shadow of yin. </p>
<p>In cases of sudden stiffness that have yet to be diagnosed, first administer the Suhexiang pill to awaken the patient. If there is phlegm blocking the mouth, use Guadi powder to induce vomiting, or it may be expelled through the nose as well. In cases of severe heat, apply the Dachengqi Decoction or the Shuangjiesan to purge. </p>

<p>In yang deficiency, the body is quiet, breathing is short, vision is blurred, breathing through the nose is difficult, difficulty in inhaling, fluids are not accepted, inability to control urination, the face appears pale and blackened as if scraped, or shows a preference for lying against a wall with closed eyes, not wanting to see anyone. The breath from the nose is cold, lips are not red, may appear white, blue, or purple, hands and feet are cold, nails are bluish or purplish, urine is white or light yellow, stools are loose, and upon pressing the stomach, there is heaviness without significant heat. If there is excessive yin, the cold may penetrate to the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>Yin toxicity arises from a deficiency of the kidney and coldness, possibly from consuming cold substances, exposure to cold evil, or from sweating, vomiting, or purging, developing into yin toxicity. Symptoms include headache, abdominal cramping pain, eye pain, fatigue without significant heat, coldness in the limbs, cold sweat on the forehead and backs of the hands, diffuse pain in the body, unceasing spontaneous sweating, retching sounds, weak and shallow pulse, or a weak pulse at the inch and strong at the cubit. It is treatable within five days, but after six or seven days, it becomes difficult to treat. If cold damage progresses to the three yin, expect coldness in the limbs, abdominal pain and vomiting, cold saliva, fear of cold with shivering, a face appearing as if scraped, curled up clothing, a slow and soft pulse, and immediate warming is necessary. For lighter cases, use the &quot;Regulating Middle Decoction&quot;; for heavier cases, use the &quot;Four Reverse Decoction.&quot; If the initial sickness does not present a fever but shows cold symptoms, it is termed a direct involvement of the yin channels and is similarly treated with these two decoctions.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When experiencing cold limbs and diarrhea, one may be unable to eat; if they suddenly regain the ability to eat, this is called &quot;removing the center,&quot; and it leads to death. In lesser yin disease, if one experiences cold limbs, reverse pulse, and has no pulse, and is treated with Bai Tong pig bile soup, if the pulse suddenly reappears, it indicates death. Excessive drinking and eating, or exposure to wind-cold, or being provoked by anger can lead to a blockage in the chest, preventing stomach qi from moving properly, resulting in sudden cold limbs, confusion, inability to speak, and inability to lift limbs. If mistakenly treated for stroke, this will certainly lead to death. It is advisable to prepare a ginger and salt soup to induce vomiting; for wind-cold symptoms, use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi powder, and for qi stagnation, use Ba Wei Shun Qi powder. After vomiting, if there are no other symptoms, simply adjust with herbs like Cang Zhu, Bai Zhu, Chen Pi, Hou Po, and Gan Cao. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Luo Quanshan said: The Grand Guardian Wang stated that &quot;jue&quot; refers to a reversal of qi. In modern times, it is mistakenly referred to as &quot;foot disease,&quot; but upon reading this, one realizes that in ancient times, it was called foot disease. The texts say: In cold jue, the hands and feet are cold; in hot jue, the hands and feet are hot. In wei jue, there is a combination of atrophy and jue, leading to weak and powerless feet. In bi jue, there is a combination of bi illness and jue illness, resulting in stubborn numbness, swelling, and pain in the feet. Qi rebelling can be seen in prior cases of cold jue, hot jue, wei jue, bi jue, and wind jue, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, confusion, bloating, shortness of breath, numbness in the lower abdomen, or sudden loss of consciousness, which the world refers to as foot disease attacking the heart. Nowadays, people also consider sudden fainting and loss of consciousness as jue. When asked how to interpret cold hands and feet as jue, it is said, &quot;It is not.&quot; In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s discussion of typhoid fever, a hot jue is indicated by hot hands and feet, and a cold jue by cold hands and feet, with cold being referred to as reversing. It is stated that any jue occurs when yin and yang do not harmoniously connect. Jue is characterized by the hands and feet being reversely cold. Therefore, in cases of yang deficiency that do not connect, one warms it; in cases where yang is trapped and deeply hidden, not harmonizing with yin, one purges it; where pathogenic heat invades but has not deeply penetrated, one disperses the transmitted yin heat, adjusting treatment according to the depth and severity. This pertains to the pathogenic factor of typhoid fever entering the interior, where the rebellious jue of the great yin hands and feet corresponds only to the two channels. Since it is a discussion of the pathogenic element transmitted through the six channels of typhoid, it is known that jue yin is the channel where the two yins intersect. When heat transmits to this location, it has reached an extreme depth, which is why it is called jue yin.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discourse in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; on this topic is different. It states that the three yang channels originate from the surface of the five toes, while the three yin channels emerge from the inner sides of the same toes. Therefore, when the yang energy is abundant, the lower body becomes warm; when the yin energy prevails, cold rises from the toes to the knees. Regarding the cause of cold syndromes, it is said that the &quot;front yin&quot; is where the tendons gather, and it unites the taiyin and yangming channels. This occurs when a person is robust, during the autumn and winter when yin energy is strong and yang energy weakens. This results in an imbalance; the energy is depleted, and the flowing upwards is resisted, leading to an overflow of essence downward. Pathogenic energies ascend as a consequence, and the waning yang cannot nourish the meridians. As a result, yang diminishes each day while yin remains dominant, causing the hands and feet to feel cold.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In discussing the causes of heat stroke, it is said that a person must often become drunk. If one indulges while full, the qi accumulates in the spleen, the kidney qi gradually declines, and the yang qi predominates, resulting in heat in the hands and feet. Observing its subtle essence, it likely relates to the kidneys receiving the essence of prenatal vitality, from which the original qi is filled, resulting in the interdependence of the two organs and the flow of the vessels. The operation of yin and yang within and without occurs, each with its own duties; yang governs the warming of the exterior, while yin governs the cooling of the interior. The vessels connect and circulate through the limbs; hence, I cite the example of the spleen and stomach being harmed by alcohol and lust, leading to severe cases of yin and yang disorders at the beginning of the text. Continuing to discuss the twelve channels of reversal, one only addresses the reversal of qi in the primary channels without mentioning the heat in the hands and feet or the reasons for the sickness; these cannot be fully explained in a single statement. Having established the two examples above, one can extend the inference to these matters, therefore it is not necessary to repeat them. Nevertheless, I will provide detailed exposition on other sections related to syncope to clarify the matter.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the discussion on the Taiyin and Yangming: The Yangming involves the five organs and six bowels drawing vital energy from the stomach. Now, if the spleen is diseased and cannot assist the stomach in moving its fluids to the three Yin, the stomach likewise cannot transport fluids to the three Yang. Consequently, the limbs fail to receive the vital energy from food and grain, leading to progressive decline. The menstrual flow becomes unbeneficial, and the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the energy to thrive. In this context, the spleen and stomach oscillate between fullness and emptiness, with one being deficient and unable to move fluids while the other is excessive and acts independently. This independent action inevitably causes cold, which is one cause of syncope from the spleen and stomach. Furthermore, all twelve meridians draw vital energy from the stomach. If the stomach is cold, the energy in the meridians becomes cold; if the stomach is hot, the energy in the meridians becomes hot. Thus, when the meridians are not harmonized, there will inevitably be residual cold or heat at the extremities. This is the second cause of syncope from the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Furthermore, the spleen and stomach are the organs that govern the kidneys. When the spleen and stomach are afflicted, they will impact the kidneys, where the kidneys regulate the lower body, especially in cases of syncope. If the kidneys are affected by pathogens, syncope occurs; this is the third cause of syncope related to the spleen and stomach. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: the Chong vessel, which shares its origin with the Shaoyin and the Great Luo from the kidneys, is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, thus all five organs and six bowels are nourished by it. The upper part of the Chong vessel nourishes Yang, and infuses essence; the lower part connects to the Shaoyin channel, moistens the three Yin, infuses the collaterals, and warms the muscles. If the collateral networks are blocked, the diaphragm becomes immobile; if it is immobile, syncope results, leading to coldness. The Chong vessel is responsible for the Yang that governs the internal functions of the kidneys; Yang is associated with fire. If this Yang moves properly, it is a minor fire that nourishes life; if it moves chaotically, it becomes a strong fire that harms, and excessive fire weakens the original true Yang. Dongyuan stated that fire and original Qi cannot coexist; when one prevails, the other is diminished. As previously discussed regarding syncope, when the Qi is downward and conflicts arise upwards, the pathogenic Qi follows, not from a separate source, but from the chaos of this fire, causing the tumultuous energies of Yin and Yang to rise in rebellion.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, it is said that the disease of the Chong Vessel arises from reversed qi, and the pathogenic mechanisms indicate that all reversed influences ascending are associated with fire, while all collapses are associated with the lower part. However, when the yin and yang of the kidneys are harmonized, treatments for the lower part are effective; if they are not harmonized, treatments for the lower part will fail, leading to the emergence of heat and cold collapses. This is the pathway of the kidneys concerning collapses. </p>
<p>As for the Chong Vessel and the stomach, both are named after the sea; hence, the diseases of collapse in the twelve vessels are all related. Additionally, other texts discussing collapses mention that excess yang qi can lead to an outburst, where essence is exhausted and accumulations form in summer, causing people to experience collapses. There are also conditions where two yangs and one yin cause wind collapse; cases where lack of determination leads to collapses; organ collapses; sudden and unrecognized collapses; and collapses where all five collaterals are exhausted. </p>
<p>All these causes, arising from reversed evils, involve the intertwining of fire and the five types of fire, leading to disruptions in the qi of the vessels, thus resulting from the interactions of the five qi: wind, cold, dryness, dampness, and heat.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five energies often transform and interact with one another. Wind and dryness transform together into heat; dampness and cold transform together into cold symptoms. When illness is severe, the limbs may be influenced by the cold and heat into a state of reversal. The rebellious qi that rises from below must rely on the fiery strength to achieve this. The San Jiao, foot Shao Yang, Chong, Ren, and Du meridians all govern the fire below, yet they all belong to the kidneys. Why is this? The foot Shao Yin and hand Shao Yin interact at midday, residing in between; this allows the kidney&#39;s original qi to be stabilized. If the ministerial fire is improperly activated, one must first support the kidneys and regulate the treatment to redirect the rebellious qi, differentiating the strengths of the five energies to adjust them appropriately. However, there are also cases where the body does not become cold due to the uprising of qi. As stated in &quot;The Original Patterns of Disease,&quot; yin water governs purity, thus if there is cold illness, the four limbs may feel cold. This indicates that yang is weak while yin is present, resulting in cold. This corresponds to the principle stated by Zhongjing that one experiences reversal before heat; due to the cold pathogen from the outside, the yang qi is unable to overcome it, hence the initial state of reversal. Though evils may be categorized as internal and external, in the context of warming, they are essentially singular.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blood Collapse</strong> </p>
<p>There are individuals who, without any previous illness, suddenly become lifeless, their bodies immobile and silent, unaware of others, with closed eyes that cannot open, and mouths that cannot speak. They may have a slight awareness of others but dislike hearing any sounds, feeling as though in a daze, only regaining consciousness after a while. This condition is caused by excessive sweating, leading to a deficiency of blood and qi being stagnant in the blood, with yang rising but not descending. Qi becomes blocked and fails to circulate, resulting in a death-like state. When qi returns to the blood and yin and yang are restored, consciousness returns after some time. This is called &quot;stagnation collapse,&quot; also known as &quot;blood collapse.&quot; It is often found in women. The treatment should be Baiwei Decoction or Cangong Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Various Types of Collapse</strong> </p>
<p>Collapse is not a fixed illness. Yang collapse supplements yin, nourishing the master of water; yin collapse supplements yang, enhancing the source of fire. These forms of yin and yang collapse differ from the yin and yang collapses associated with cold damage. In cases of cold damage, yang collapse requires the method of pushing out the old to bring in the new, while yin collapse requires the use of Fuzi to regulate the center. The differences are as pronounced as between ice and fire, with life and death within reach.</p>
<p>When yang qi is weak and deficient, yin must compensate, causing cold to travel from the fingers to the knees, known as cold collapse. This is an inversion of cold downward, treated with Liuwu Fuzi Decoction. When yin retreats, yang advances; therefore, when yin qi weakens below, yang moves to replenish it, resulting in warmth in the feet. When the heat intensifies, it may ascend along the three yin pathways, termed heat collapse, which should be treated with Liuw Wei Di Huang Pill. The liver stores blood and governs anger; thus, when anger arises, fire ascends in the liver, carrying blood upward, resulting in chaotic blood and qi within the chest, leading to a reversal and termed thin collapse, which should be treated with Puhuang Decoction.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All movements belong to Yang; thus, when one is overworked, it disturbs the Yang, causing the Yang energy to expand. When the Yang energy expands, the fire of labor becomes excessive. Excessive fire causes water to dry up, leading to exhaustion of essence. This results in prolonged accumulation, and by summer, both internal and external heat increase, further depleting water and increasing fire.

<p>Cold phlegm leads to confusion, with the extremities feeling cold; this is termed &quot;phlegm reversal,&quot; for which Jiang Fu Tang is recommended. Stomach cold may cause the expulsion of roundworms, known as &quot;roundworm reversal,&quot; for which Wu Mei San with Li Zhong Tang is recommended.</p>
<p>Qi is the Yang of the human body; any stagnation leads to the inability of Yang Qi to circulate, resulting in coldness of the hands and feet, resembling a stroke. However, in a stroke, the body tends to be warm, and in Qi reversal, the body is cold. This is termed &quot;Qi reversal,&quot; for which Ba Wei Shun Qi San is recommended.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Classics</strong></p>
<p>In the section detailing pulse diagnosis, it is stated that &quot;厥&quot; refers to the internal depletion, meaning the loss of the essence and vital energy of the five internal organs. &quot;喑&quot; indicates an inability to produce sound. &quot;俳&quot; refers to the body&#39;s limbs being impaired. Nowadays, when people encounter these symptoms, they will likely label them as stroke without realizing it results from internal depletion and kidney deficiency. This is because sound originates from the lungs and fundamentally relies on the kidneys, while physical strength is rooted in blood and fundamentally depends on essence. The foundation of vital energy primarily lies in the kidneys; thus, when the lesser yin is insufficient, it results in &quot;厥.&quot; Furthermore, the essay on regulating the meridians states that a deficiency of will leads to &quot;厥.&quot; The section on the spirit indicates that a deficiency in kidney energy leads to &quot;厥.&quot; Observing these discussions, it is clear that the essence of &quot;厥&quot; is not related to wind. Therefore, for treating this condition, one should emphasize methods that are not based on wind symptoms. The essay on regulating the meridians indicates that both energy and blood can be deficient, revealing an imbalance of yin and yang. If both energy and blood travel upwards, it indicates a deficiency of yin below and a lack of root in the spirit, resulting in the separation of yin and yang, which may cause sudden death. If the condition is slight, recovery can be achieved; if it is severe, the situation is critical.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is precisely what people today refer to as an abrupt fall or collapse due to a stroke, which is also a stroke caused by phlegm-heat obstructing the upper body, while failing to realize that it actually stems from a deficiency in the lower body. However, the condition of the upper body being &#39;full&#39; is only a false fullness, and in severe cases, it should be slightly cleared. The deficiency in the lower body is a true emptiness; if there are no pathogenic factors to address, then one must promptly strengthen the lower body decisively. </p>
<p>In observing the passages of the Yangming classic regarding the linking of channels and organs, it is stated that &#39;reversal of qi&#39; is significant, which is quite evident and straightforward! The linking of channels indicates that the illness lies in the muscles, hence it is light and produces symptoms; whereas, the linking of organs indicates that the illness lies at the root, thus it is heavy and fatal. Having recognized this as a reversal of qi, it can be discerned that symptoms like abrupt falls and collapses are not truly strokes, but various scholars in Hejian refer to the central organs, which leads to confusion between true and false strokes, making it difficult to distinguish. </p>
<p>The detailed discussions in the Great Righteousness Treatise and the Subtle Analysis Treatise state: &quot;When the pulse reaches a state resembling panting, it indicates a pulse that is rapid and urgent like breathlessness, reflecting a condition of chaotic blood and qi, hence resulting in sudden reversal and inability to speak,&quot; which aligns with what people today refer to as a &#39;silent stroke.&#39;<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Yunyang, the upper part is hot and the lower part is cold; this indicates a condition where water and fire do not interact, leading to a state of blindness, akin to dizziness caused by wind. Those who cannot speak are suffering issues related to the lungs and kidneys, while those who are dizzy have problems linked to the liver and spleen. For those who temporarily regain consciousness, recovery can occur when the Qi returns; however, if the Yin deteriorates, it is a very dangerous condition. All should be treated according to the previous principles to address the root cause.</p>
<p>In the discussion of the &quot;End and Beginning&quot; chapter, it states: sudden clarity refers to sudden coldness; if it feels like being split or severed, it is described as painful and indescribable, which aligns with the so-called confusion and disturbance caused by wind. Those with heat often experience warmth and a strong pulse, thus it is advisable to clear the fire within the Yin. Those with phlegm often suffer from wheezing and have a slippery pulse, thus it is necessary to relieve the phlegm in the upper jiao. For those without fire or phlegm, they tend to feel cold and have a weak pulse, hence it is necessary to tonify the primordial Qi. In cases with such symptoms coupled with confusion and loss of consciousness, this represents a severe condition involving multiple organs, often difficult to treat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Connecting Qi to the Heavens&quot; chapter explains that convulsions due to heat are a type of heat stroke, caused by overexertion accumulating during summer, which can now be referred to as heat wind.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

Hence, it is referred to as the Sea of Blood or the Gate of Life; this is what is called the fundamental abode. If one indulges in passions, leading to the depletion of the source of essence and energy, conditions such as syncope and sudden collapse will arise from this. Otherwise, how is it that one can suddenly fall, with both spirit and body in decline, utterly oblivious to surroundings? When it reaches this point, is it merely a disease of a single meridian or organ? Upon examination, it becomes clear that it is indeed due to the collapse of the Chong Vessel, without a doubt. Therefore, anyone who treats this by seeking relief without addressing the root cause, it is certain that such reasoning is flawed! Specifically regarding the discussion of the condition of shock from external evil influence, it is associated with sudden onset of malign conditions.

They might also experience dizziness and lose consciousness; this is referred to as &quot;corpse syncope&quot; or &quot;sudden syncope.&quot; Acupuncture should be employed, as detailed in the classic texts. If moxibustion is used, the methods of Qin Chengzu and Hua Tuo for moxibustion on the yang are particularly effective. </p>
<p>In all medicinal practices, one must understand that the presence of evils is due to qi deficiency; therefore, in the classic texts, it is mentioned to use blood from the left side to replenish the Five Meridians that are depleted, which is clear in meaning. In such dangerous moments, without employing herbs like ginseng and Aconite to restore yang, how can one recover? If the evil qi is overwhelming and the chest is obstructed, one must first clear the passages before regulating. One should primarily use formulas like Jin Zheng Qi San, Liu Qi Yin, green onion and ginger soup, or Su He Wan.</p>
<p>A discussion on the strength and weakness of formulas concludes that counteracting the path of qi is the same as syncope. The interplay of yin and yang qi is such that yang rises from the left and yin descends from the right; therefore, for yang illnesses, the left side is more severe, and for yin illnesses, the right side is more severe. When the rising does not rise and the descending does not descend, it is the reversal of the natural flow of qi.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

In contrast, the vitality of youth is initially strong from below, and what rises from below is in accordance with nature.

When one becomes ill and cannot rise or fall, it indicates that their foundation has deteriorated, hence the cold and extremities reach to the knees. The youth, with their yang energy still vigorous, face decomposition during autumn and winter; the elderly, with their yang energy inherently diminished and more sensitive to cold, therefore have no worries in autumn and winter. All these diseases of inversion, where yang appears not to be yang and yin seems not to be yin, create a separation of the five organs, leaving no evidence to verify. If one cannot complete their days, it signifies their serious decline. Furthermore, in dreams where one is utterly confused and disoriented, this results from the heart and kidneys not communicating, causing the spirit to scatter and stray, thus leading to inversion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discussion of cold and hot collapse (jue) involves the hands and feet as terms, but essentially speaks to the disorder of yin and yang. Cold collapse represents a loss due to usage, while hot collapse arises from excessive drinking. This is because the energies of yin and yang invariably manifest in the hands and feet; thus, when collapse is about to occur, cold and heat numbness must first emerge from the hands and feet. When it becomes severe, it may manifest in various ways, potentially affecting the five organs and six bowels, each presenting its own symptoms. Therefore, the collapse of the hands and feet serves primarily as a visible sign, and by recognizing slight indications, one should consider the underlying causes.</p>
<p>Examining Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s views on reverse collapse, there are notable differences from the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; discussions concerning the hands and feet distinguish between cold and hot collapse, whereas Zhang Zhongjing focuses solely on the aspect of cold reversal as a form of collapse. Furthermore, concerning the discussion of evil and righteous energies, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; addresses the original qi, hence the manifold symptoms, encompassing both qi and blood, which all bear critical signs; in contrast, Zhang Zhongjing emphasizes the role of evil qi, considering the hands and feet only, with fears directed towards the descent of yin and the retreat of yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Argument</h3>
<p>The signs of reversal (or counterflow) are those of danger. The term &#39;reversal&#39; signifies a complete disruption or chaos, representing the disorder of qi and blood. This is why the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; places special emphasis on it and explains it in detail. It states that sudden and violent reversals are both general names for this condition. For instance, terms like cold reversal and hot reversal differentiate the yin and yang aspects of the condition. When mentioning connected channels and organs, it discusses the life and death aspects of reversal. Moreover, the distinctions among the various channels and organs have also been elaborated upon.</p>
<p>Additionally, in recent times, there are still signs such as qi reversal, blood reversal, phlegm reversal, alcohol reversal, and ascaris reversal, all of which are fundamentally based on these principles. Observing the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; they appear to be quite clear; however, later generations still fail to recognize this. Whenever they encounter these signs, they tend to label them all as a stroke, unaware of what reversal truly signifies, thus treating them as wind disorders, which can lead to greater harm. I am deeply saddened by this, which is why I have made efforts to clarify previous misinterpretations of wind conditions.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of these conditions, it should be approached as treating the previous non-wind signs, using them in conjunction. This is precisely how one should address reversal.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>In cases of cold extremities, the limbs must be cool, with a pulse that is deep, faint, and infrequent; or, even if frequent, it is weak. The patient may fear cold and prefer warmth, covering themselves with clothing, or may experience diarrhea of clear fluids, and the physical symptoms are generally weak. Although these cases all pertain to cold syndromes, there are many conditions that resemble heat but are not actually heat-related. Therefore, whenever there is cold extremity with pulse and symptoms not indicative of real heat, it is certainly cold extremity without doubt. </p>
<p>Hot extremities must first show numerous heat-related symptoms, with a pulse that is deep, slippery, and rapid; the patient fears heat and prefers coolness, may wave their hands and kick their feet, or feel restless, with constipation and dark stools, and the physical symptoms are often marked by confusion or stupor. </p>
<p>When treating these two conditions, one should apply methods distinct from treating cold and heat conditions associated with wind. As for the case of cold extremities resulting from cold damage, both its yin and yang aspects should be discerned using this method. However, in cases of cold extremities due to cold damage, the distinction lies in the pathogenic qi, hence cold extremities should be treated with warming methods, while hot extremities should be addressed with purging methods.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

<p>There are two types of blood stasis: one caused by blood loss and the other by blood reversal, both of which can lead to stasis. Blood loss occurs in cases of severe bleeding or excessive blood loss during childbirth, leading to a loss of qi as well, hence causing sudden collapse and death. In such cases, one should first pinch the philtrum or burn vinegar with charcoal to gather the qi, and urgently administer one or two taels of ginseng decoction to restore the qi, ensuring it does not completely escape; this will lead to gradual recovery. Then, according to the conditions of cold or heat, one may proceed to regulate it accordingly; this is called replenishing the qi after blood loss. </p>
<p>If one does not understand this and merely uses medicines for the blood, even a small amount of qi could suddenly dissipate, leaving the yin with nothing to support it, and thus there would be no vitality. If one considers using cold and cooling methods to stop the bleeding, it will certainly damage the yang qi, hastening death.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Blood reversal refers to the phenomenon where blood and qi move together upwards, and it is also described as a condition where intense anger causes the manifestation of qi to be disrupted, leading to blood accumulating above. When blood is affected by reverse qi, it is essential to first regulate the qi; when qi flows smoothly, blood will follow suit. It is advisable to use formulas like Tongyu Decoction or Huagan Decoction to address this condition and, once blood circulation is restored and qi is relaxed, to treat according to the specific symptoms.</p>
<p>When phlegm and fluids obstruct the body, causing qi to become stagnant and mental confusion, and neither medication nor food can alleviate it, one must prioritize either inducing vomiting or relieving the blockage to address the urgent condition. Once the phlegm and qi have opened slightly, one should then treat the root cause of the illness. If phlegm is caused by heat, it should be cleared and driven down; if caused by wind and cold, it should be dispersed and warmed; if caused by dampness, it should be dried and regulated; if caused by spleen deficiency, the spleen should be strengthened; if caused by kidney deficiency, the kidneys should be nourished. Treating the underlying causes will allow the phlegm to clear naturally. However, there are cases where phlegm cannot be treated directly, as pushing too hard may worsen the condition and exacerbate the phlegm.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

When their vital energy is strong and can overcome it, they do not recognize the harm of alcohol; but when they begin to weaken, the effects of alcohol become frightening. There are many ailments caused by alcohol, and their origins are unknown. When it comes to alcoholic syncope, it closely resembles a stroke: in mild cases, the person may still be aware, but in severe cases, they may suddenly collapse, become unresponsive, or exhibit sudden confusion, agitation, inability to speak, excessive phlegm, breathlessness, fever, cough, or even spitting blood. If one observes that the stools are dry and the pulse is strong and prefers cold, this indicates excess heat and dampness obstructing upward, and it is advisable to use methods like extracting the fuel (removing the underlying cause) and drinking to swiftly cool the fire.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yin and Yang Syndromes</p>
<p>There are two types of syndromes: Yang syndrome and Yin syndrome. Yang syndrome, or heat syndrome, occurs when heat travels from the three Yang channels into the Yin system. It initially manifests as headache and fever, starting shallow and progressing deeper, eventually affecting the three Yin channels, leading to coldness in the limbs and sometimes warmth. The symptoms include constipation, restlessness, delirium, thirst, aversion to heat rather than cold, and a deep, strong pulse. This is caused by the transformation of heat in the channels; externally, the hands and feet may feel cold, but internally it is due to a pathogenic heat. When Yang syndrome manifests, it resembles Yin, hence it is called Yang syndrome. The symptoms arise from internal heat or loss of Yang at its descending point. If the syndrome is mild, the heat is also mild, and remedies like Si Ni San are appropriate; if severe, then stronger remedies like Cheng Qi Decoction are needed. </p>
<p>Yin syndrome, or cold syndrome, does not initially show signs of heat from the three Yang channels. Instead, true cold directly invades the three Yin channels, causing aversion to cold, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, shivering, and a lack of thirst, with a deep, weak pulse. This syndrome is characterized by the absence of Yang, thus it is called Yin syndrome. For mild cases, Li Zhong Decoction is suitable, while for severe cases, Si Ni Decoction or Hui Yang Decoction are recommended. </p>
<p>Note that the differentiation between Yang and Yin syndromes is as described; this is a fundamental principle of the ancients. However, I humbly offer my distinctions.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of Yin inversion, where there are no Yang symptoms or Yang pulse but the illness manifests as cold, it is clearly a Yin condition. Nowadays, people simply call it middle cold, which is indeed the disease. However, few fall into this error, and it&#39;s not difficult to understand. The treatment should be to warm the center without needing further distinction. </p>
<p>As for Yang inversion, distinguishing it is necessary. Inversion arises from the transmission of the three Yangs, leading to Yang inversion, which is indeed the case. Even in discussing transmission through the channels, can it be said that there are no Yin conditions? Therefore, any illness resulting from true Yang deficiency is also a Yin inversion within Yang; a weak pulse with no spirit is also a Yin inversion within Yang; excessive attack or cooling leads to a Yin inversion within Yang as well. </p>
<p>The four limbs are the roots of all Yang; unless there are symptoms like heat accumulation, restlessness, thirst, or fullness, inverted coldness indicates a deficiency of Yang energy. Cheng Wujie stated: generally, inversion is related to Yin, and is often associated with coldness. He also said: inversion is the amplification of Yin. Therefore, conditions of combined deficiency and coldness, although they may arise from the Yang channels, are still a Yin inversion within Yang. </p>
<p>Should Yin within Yin be warmed, or should Yin within Yang be cooled? Scholars should not think that the presence of headache and fever, merely due to the transmission of the three Yangs, automatically classifies it as Yang inversion, as treating cold caused by heat would lead to significant harm.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Record of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><em>By Qing Dynasty Chen Shiduo</em></p>
<p>The treatment method for the condition involves understanding that when one experiences sudden coldness and pain in the limbs, it is often mistaken for a wind-related issue of the extremities. In reality, it is the internal heat of the heart that cannot be released, leading to cold limbs while the chest and abdomen feel hot. The prescription consists of three qian of Chai Hu, two qian of Dang Gui, one qian of Jing Jie, two qian of Huang Lian, two qian of stir-fried Zhi Zi, one qian of Ban Xia, and one qian of Zhi Ke, which should be decocted in water. One dose will stabilize the condition, while two doses will lead to complete recovery. This is because many cases of cold limbs are due to internal fire, and intense coldness corresponds to intense heat. Thus, by relieving internal heat, the limbs will warm up. The brilliance of this formula lies in using Chai Hu as the chief ingredient, which, along with other cooling herbs, directly enters the heart and liver without causing stagnation in the chest. Chai Hu is adept at dispersing external and internal evils, and is effective in alleviating pent-up energy. Merely treating the limbs without addressing the core issue would be like capturing the underlings without catching the leader; the remaining forces would remain uncontained. Therefore, the focus should not be solely on the limbs but primarily on the heart and chest.</p>
<p>While many cases of this condition are indeed caused by internal heat, there are also instances of coldness that lead to the same symptoms, resulting from chilled Yin entering the kidney palace. This will inevitably challenge the heart&#39;s fire with the kidney&#39;s cold water being on the rise, leading to a weakened ruling fire while the subordinate becomes strong. If one does not urgently use strong heating remedies to save the heart, a crisis could ensue at any moment.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

Boil with water and take as a decoction; one dose will cure. However, it is crucial to distinguish between cold and heat patterns, as they are vastly different. In cold qi deficiency, the hands and feet will be blue, drinking water will induce vomiting, and there will be abdominal pain, with a preference for warmth for relief. In contrast, with heat qi deficiency, the hands and feet may feel cold but will not appear bluish; water will not induce vomiting, and warmth will exacerbate abdominal pain. If one can accurately diagnose and appropriately use medicine, the treatment will be effective as soon as it reaches the throat—this is the mark of a true healer, and there is no need for talismans or incantations.</p>
<p>For treatment, if it is a case of corpse pattern due to evil qi blockage, medication must be used to open it. Do not use the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting; instead, use soapberry to provoke sneezing. Use seven gourd stems, and prepare with two bowls of water, reducing it to one bowl of decoction, adding a little salt to administer, which will induce a heavy cough with thick phlegm, resulting in cure. Alternatively, grind soapberry spines into fine powder, fill a goose feather quill with the powder, and blow it into the patient&#39;s nose. If they sneeze and expel thick phlegm resembling yellow substances, they will be cured. Most cases of qi deficiency are due to heat evil, yet the heat evil must manifest in cries; now, silently and lifelessly, resembling a corpse, it is clear this is a case of yin deficiency suddenly struck by yin evil. Therefore, do not treat a yang deficiency with methods meant for it, as this could lead to failure. It is better to first use gourd stem and soapberry to induce vomiting to remove phlegm. Once the voice returns, treat with five qian of ginseng, one qian of white peony, three qian of poria, five qian of white atractylodes, and two qian of pinellia to restore stability.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is indeed a method for opening treatment. The method for inducing sneezing is to grind three qian of fresh Pinellia into a powder, form it into water balls the size of yellow beans, and insert them into the nostrils; it will surely induce persistent sneezing. Drink water, and it will stop immediately. This method treats conditions like wind stroke, speechlessness, and corpse-like stupor, as well as demonic possession; all are excellent methods for opening treatment.</p>
<p>The method of guiding treatment is as follows: if someone suffers from symptoms of reversal due to a stroke and is afraid to use medicine for treatment, take one liang of Wu zhu yu and grind it into a powder, mix it with half a liang of flour, and add water to form a thick paste. Spread it onto a cloth about the size of a bell, forming a thick paper about half a fen thick, and apply it to the Yongquan acupoint. This will keep the hands and feet from reversing. This method can also be used to treat symptoms of upper heat and lower cold; it is a method for guiding fire back to its source as well.</p>
<p>For immediate treatment, one must not lie down or sit while administering the treatment. In cases where there is often reversal of the hands and feet, it is essential to stand and take the medicine, as it will stabilize instantly. This is because the symptoms of reversal originally stem from a heat disease; the deeper the heat, the more profound the reversal. If one lies down while taking the medicine, the medicine reaches the stomach, and upon encountering boiling fire qi, it will surge and not be absorbed, leading to vomiting. However, if one stands while taking the medicine, there will be no worry of vomiting. The prescription includes three qian each of Huang lian, Fu ling, and Bai shao, and one qian each of Chai hu, Bai jie zi, Mu guo, and Gan cao, to be boiled and taken.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This formula is purely for calming the liver, eliminating heat while also harmonizing the nature of heat, making it suitable for ingestion without causing any regurgitation. However, when heat rises, vomiting can often occur. Patients should be held upright, and one person should administer the medicine and drink, allowing it to stay in the mouth for a while before laying them down, so that the medicine can act smoothly without the distress of vomiting. </p>
<p>Some individuals may suddenly faint, unable to speak, with closed eyes and limp hands, making snoring sounds from their throats, with excessive phlegm and gas, leading to death within a day for some, or two or three days for others. This condition often troubles the spirit, but it is also due to excessive phlegm and gas. The treatment should thus focus primarily on eliminating phlegm, but simply attacking phlegm without opening the orifices is futile. The formula used is the Qiming Pill: five qian each of fresh Pinellia and ginseng, one liang of dodder seed, three fen of licorice, three qian of Poria, one qian each of soap pod and fresh ginger, and two qian of sweet flag, to be decocted in water and taken. </p>
<p>In this formula, both ginseng and Pinellia are used in equal amounts to provide both attacking and tonifying effects, making it easier to dissipate phlegm and restore qi. The use of dodder seed as the chief ingredient helps to restore vital energy and disperse pathogenic factors; the addition of soap pod, sweet flag, and Poria opens the orifices to clear the heart, naturally allowing the qi to return and the fainting to stabilize. If there are doubts about the fainting being due to heat, and cold medicines are lightly used, it will drive the vital energy away. Fresh Pinellia is used rather than processed to preserve its life force for rescue during critical moments; over-preparation leads to reduced efficacy, making it ineffective.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If someone suddenly dies and appears as if in a state of rigor mortis: take two white horse front hooves and two night eyes, and burn fourteen stems from a white horse&#39;s tail. Prepare medicinal balls the size of small beans from strong wine, and administer two of these down with white soup. After a moment, if taken again, they will revive.</p>
<p>Regarding acupuncture and moxibustion: </p>
<p>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: When the solar organ alone is affected, it leads to fainting and breathlessness due to excess yang and insufficient yin. Both the exterior and interior should be treated by purging from below. When the lesser yang organ is alone affected, it causes fainting gas. If there is sudden and severe pain, one should also purge from below. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: There is an affliction presenting with swelling, neck pain, chest fullness, and abdominal distension. What illness is this, and how does it occur? Qi Bo replied: This is called &quot;fainting reversal.&quot; The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: Moxibustion would lead to muteness, and stone treatment would lead to madness; it is necessary for the vital energy to be united for effective treatment.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qi Bo replied: When yang energy is excessively rising, it leads to an excess above; moxibustion directs the yang energy into the yin, causing muteness. Stone treatment depletes the yang energy, leading to madness. The treatment should be done once the energies converge to promote recovery.</p>
<p>When cold energy invades the five organs, it causes fainting and upward leakage, resulting in depletion of yin energy. If yang energy has not entered, it can lead to sudden pain and death without awareness, but if the energy reverses, recovery is possible. Cold energy invading the intestines and stomach causes upward reversal, leading to pain and vomiting.</p>
<p>Evil energy invades the pathways of the hands and feet, as well as the lesser yin, greater yin, and foot yangming channels. These five pathways all converge in the ear. When they are completely depleted, the body’s pulse moves while there is no awareness, resembling a corpse, which some refer to as &quot;corpse fainting.&quot;<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the limbs are cold and the abdomen makes a rumbling sound, there is much cold air; the abdomen is filled with gurgling sounds and it becomes difficult to urinate, involving the foot of the Taiyin. When limbs are weak and cold, with the four extremities bound, one must treat it accordingly, twice daily. If there is numbness, one will know within ten days that it has not ceased, and the illness will have stopped.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What does it mean to be reversed and disordered? Qi Bo replied: Clear qi is in the yin, turbid qi is in the yang; nourishing qi moves smoothly through the vessels, while protective qi moves in reverse, with clarity and turbidity interfering with each other. Disorder in the arms and legs results in the four extremities being cold; disorder in the head leads to reverse cold and a heavy head that causes dizziness and fainting. With the right method and a way to resolve it, understanding this path is a treasure for the body. </p>
<p>If there is qi in the head, it should be drawn from the Tian Zhu and Da Zhu points; if not understood, take the foot taiyang&#39;s Xingshu. If qi is in the arms and legs, first draw from the blood vessels, then from the Yangming and Shaoyang points. </p>
<p>When it is cold, the ground freezes and water turns to ice; human qi is within, the skin closes, pores become blocked, sweat does not emerge, blood and qi become strong, and the flesh is firm and hard. At such times, even good acupuncturists cannot alleviate the four extremities&#39; cold. When the blood vessels congeal and are firm, they cannot move freely; hence, one cannot soften them immediately. </p>
<p>Therefore, to treat cold, one must first warm the area, harmonizing the meridians. Adjusting the palms, armpits, feet, neck, and spine to restore balance; once the fire qi flows, the blood vessels will circulate. Then assess the condition of the pulse; those that are muddy and stagnant should be needled and leveled, while those that are firm and tight should be broken up and dispersed until the qi settles, which is known as resolving the blockage.</p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: A heavy head, closed eyes, cold sweat not flowing, indicate a need for the Tàodào master. If there is pressing pain between the shoulders and hips, cold sweat, and aversion to cold, the Po (soul) needs to be addressed.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Gujin Yitong&quot; explains that for reversal of qi, moxibustion should be applied to the Renzhong acupoint, which is located below the nose, with seven moxa sessions.

<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: When the hands and feet are cold and reversed, first focus on the navel, then on the Yongquan (bubbling spring) point. Pull from the ribs upwards to the navel, then from the navel downwards to the Yongquan, and finally from the left ribs across to the right ribs, and from the right ribs across to the left ribs, doing this six times each.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Righteous Way to Serve Parents&quot; states: A man was ill with phlegm and syncope, not recognizing people, with tightly clenched jaws, unable to take any medicine, awaiting death. A practitioner saw him and asked if there was any saliva in the patient’s mouth. The answer was yes. The practitioner first prepared a decoction of Fangfeng and Lilies (zhilong), mixing it with powdered melon seed to administer orally. When that couldn’t go down, he took a long clam shell, ground off the sharp edge, wrapped the tip in paper, and applied it to the right nostril, hearing a sound as it swallowed. Then he did the same for the left nostril. The practitioner remarked: &quot;He can be treated now.&quot; After a while, as no saliva came out, he then used one qian of arsenic and administered it through the nose. Suddenly the patient lay back, seeming to feel pain, and shortly thereafter spat out a large quantity of thick, fishy saliva. Arsenic should usually not be used; because the illness was severe, this was the only method to stimulate movement. However, without melon seeds, it should not be used casually, and care should be taken. Generally, for those suffering from phlegm obstruction due to stroke, people often mistakenly focus only on wind treatments, relying on ineffective wind medicines. Liu Hejian treated stroke by addressing fire first, thus applying this method effectively within the context of fire.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

With yin and yang blocked, and ascent and descent obstructed, the pulse was hidden while qi was somewhat observable. I took one tael of dried orange peel and sand seeds, eight qian of ginger, and three qian of salt, decocting them for a finger probing and inducing vomiting, resulting in five or six bowls of food being expelled, revealing the pulse completely. The left guan pulse was large, and the chest and abdominal pain was severe; I knew it was caused by great anger. I prescription wood incense, green peel, tangerine skins, white atractylodes, and cyperus, decocting and prescribing; with two doses, the pain ceased.

Qi Bo replied: When Yang qi declines below, it results in cold Shen; when Yin qi declines below, it results in heat Shen. (Note: When qi is reversed, it causes confusion, leading to dizziness or fainting, and one may suddenly lose awareness of others. This condition is termed Shen, which differs from a stroke. There are conditions of both cold and heat, and both Yin and Yang energy are involved. Both Yin and Yang qi rise from below; hence, the causes of cold and heat Shen arise from the decline of these energies below.) The Emperor said: The heat of heat Shen certainly arises from below the feet, why is that? Qi Bo replied: Yang qi rises from the tips of the toes, while the Yin vessels gather below the feet and converge at the soles. Therefore, when Yang qi prevails, it generates heat below the feet. (Note: When Yang qi dominates, Yin qi becomes deficient and Yang takes precedence, thus heat Shen originates from below the feet.) The Emperor said: The cold of cold Shen certainly must ascend from the toes to the knees, why is that? Qi Bo replied: Yin qi rises from within the toes, gathers beneath the knees, and converges above the knees; hence, when Yin qi prevails, it results in cold rising from the toes to the knees.

Thus, the cold comes not from the outside but rather from within. The Emperor asked: \"What causes cold and convulsions?\" Qi Bo replied: \"The front Yin is where the Zong muscles converge, a meeting of the Tai Yin and Yang Ming. In spring and summer, Yang energy is abundant while Yin energy is sparse; in autumn and winter, Yin energy is strong while Yang energy declines. If a person is robust yet suffers from a loss during autumn and winter, their lower energy contends with the upper, failing to recover. Vital essence overflows downward, and evils rise with it. When the energy originates within, Yang energy weakens, failing to nourish the channels of the meridians. With diminishing Yang energy and only Yin remaining, the hands and feet become cold.\" The note further elaborates that the root of the Zong muscles arises from within the womb, connecting inwardly to the kidneys. The dual energies of Yin and Yang are generated in the stomach and transmitted to the Tai Yin, stored in the kidneys. The gathering of Tai Yin and Yang Ming in the Zong muscles occurs between the middle and lower Jiao, combining in the region of the front Yin. During autumn and winter, when Yang energy is conserved and Yin energy is prominent, this condition leads to cold convulsions; the robust physical nature leads one to overexert, causing lower energy to contend with upper energy, thus failing to be contained below.

The yang qi resides in the yin organs, and when the essence of yang emerges, the yin coldness rises along with it. Therefore, the yang produced in the middle burner also diminishes, unable to nourish the channels and collaterals. The qi in the upper and lower parts cannot mutually support one another, causing the yang qi to gradually deplete while the yin qi remains alone, hence the hands and feet become cold. The Emperor asked: \"What about heat stroke, how does that occur?\" Qi Bo replied: \"When alcohol enters the stomach, the collaterals become full while the main channels are empty. The spleen is responsible for transporting the fluids of the stomach. When yin qi is deficient, yang qi intrudes; when yang qi intrudes, the stomach becomes unharmonious. If the stomach is unharmonious, the essence and qi are depleted; if the essence and qi are depleted, it cannot nourish the four limbs. This person must frequently get drunk, especially after indulging, as the qi accumulates in the spleen and cannot disperse. The qi of the alcohol mingles with the qi of the grains, creating excessive internal heat, which spreads throughout the body, leading to internal heat and red urine. The abundant alcohol qi is fierce, which gradually diminishes the kidney qi, allowing the yang qi to dominate, hence the hands and feet become hot. Note: Wei qi is the vigorous qi of water and grains. Alcohol is also a vigorous and hot liquid derived from water and grains, therefore it follows the wei qi to surface on the skin and fills the collaterals, rather than moving through the channels alongside the spleen qi, resulting in full collaterals and empty channels.

If one drinks alcohol excessively, the alcohol energy accumulates in the spleen; if one indulges excessively, the food energy remains trapped in the stomach, and the spleen cannot metabolize its essences. As the food energy accumulates and cannot disperse, the alcohol energy and food energy invade each other, resulting in excessive internal heat. The heat from the central region spreads to the surroundings, causing heat to pervade the body. If the food and drink entering the stomach cannot circulate the vital essences downward to the bladder, this results in internal heat and red urine. The kidneys, as the water organs, receive and store the essences of food and water. When the alcohol heat is strong and vigorous, the vital essences of the kidneys diminish daily, the Yin energy dwindles below, and the Yang energy prevails within, causing the hands and feet to become hot. The Emperor then asked: Why do some experience abdominal fullness, some suddenly become unaware of their surroundings, and some may take half a day or even a whole day to regain awareness? Qibo replied: When Yin energy is strong above, the lower part becomes deficient, leading to abdominal fullness. When Yang energy is strong above, it causes the lower energy to press upwards, creating a reversal of evil energies.

In the case of the Taiyin channel's reversal, there is abdominal fullness and swelling, difficulty with bowel movements, lack of appetite, and if one eats, there will be vomiting, preventing sleep. This is because, when food and drink enter the stomach, the spleen is responsible for transformation and transportation; if qi is reversed in the spleen, there will be difficulty with bowel movements. If the spleen does not transport and regulate, then the stomach will also not be harmonious, resulting in vomiting and inability to sleep. In the event of the Shaoyin channel's reversal, there may be dry mouth, red urine, abdominal fullness, and heart pain. This occurs because the reversal of the meridian prevents the yin fluids from ascending, leading to dry mouth and heart pain. The lung channel cannot regulate smoothly downward, hence the red urine.

For the Jueyin channel's reversal, there will be swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distention, difficulty with urination, a tendency to sleep while bending the knees, swelling of the yin areas, and internal heat in the legs.

Note: When agitated, it causes bitterness in the mouth, frequent sighing, chest and flank pain, and an inability to turn over, indicating that the energy of the Greater Yang does not rise. The Greater Yang governs the initial energy of life, thus the gallbladder energy rises, and the energies of the eleven organs also ascend. When the energy of the Greater Yang moves abnormally, it obstructs and does not ascend, leading to symptoms such as fine dust on the face and a lack of moisture in the body.

The lower section connects with the lesser yin channel and penetrates the three yin; the front part flows within the foot, descending along the ankle, entering between the big toe, nourishing the network and warming the muscles.

The blood and energy of the five organs and six bowels all pass through the Chong channel and permeate between the skin and meridians, responding to water and following Qi to operate on the surface.

The Chong channel and the meridian of Lesser Yin permeate the three Yin channels, circulating through the ankles and entering between the big toes, radiating through the collaterals to warm the muscles. This essence and energy of the Lesser Yin flows out and operates beyond the channels and skin. Therefore, if the collaterals are obstructed, the energy of the Lesser Yin cannot circulate through the ankle, causing the ankle to become immobile. When it is immobile, it indicates that the energy of the Lesser Yin is stagnant within, leading to coldness.

When the real Qi clashes, it causes blood Qi to enter the internal organs, leading to death; if it enters the bowels, recovery occurs. This is known as sudden reversal. What does this mean? The teacher says: The lips and mouth may be blue, and the body cold, indicating entry into the internal organs, leading to death; if the body is warm and there is spontaneous sweating, it indicates entry into the bowels, leading to recovery. In the section on abdominal fullness: If there is abdominal pain with a tight, wiry pulse, the tightness indicates stagnation of defensive Qi, leading to aversion to cold; the wiriness indicates lack of appetite; when evil and correct Qi clash, it results in cold hernia. Cold hernia causes pain around the navel, and if it develops, a white fluid may be discharged, with hands and feet feeling cold; if the pulse is deep and tight, the decoction of Aconitum should be employed. In the section on water Qi: If the pulse at the wrist is slow and thin, the slowness indicates coldness, while thinness indicates insufficient blood. The pulse at the foot yin position is weak and slow; weakness indicates Qi, slowness indicates cold, and insufficient cold Qi results in hands and feet feeling cold.

Mouth sores that are rotten and red come from excessive sweating. **On Yin and Yang, Cold and Heat** Intense yang leads to an intense yin, and an intense yin leads to an intense yang; this is the transformation of cold and heat. For instance, if the hands and feet are abnormally cold, accompanied by constipation and red urine, or black stool, with a pulse that is deep and slippery, this indicates a yang syndrome. For mild cases, use Baihu Decoction; for severe cases, use Chengqi Decoction. In the case of cold damage and withdrawal, if blood and qi do not circulate, causing the limbs to become abnormally cold, this implies deep hidden heat, hence a deep state of cold. In such cases, urgently use a large dose of Chengqi Decoction with a supplementary laxative; immediate sweating will result. This aligns with Zhongjing's assertion that a cold state should be dealt with using laxatives. Heat-induced cold (reversal of functions) is different from cold-induced cold. Heat-induced cold presents with slight reversal followed by fever. Conversely, in cold-induced cold, there is no fever but cold limbs with a greater feeling of chill, a deep and thin pulse, along with loose stools and urination. Abnormal coldness in the hands and feet is referred to as \"reversal.\" Reversal indicates a lack of harmony between yin and yang, resulting in cold limbs.

One should extensively wrap the hands and feet in cotton clothing to keep them warm and urgently take a recipe such as Schisandra decoction, or possibly a combination of Ephedra, Asarum, and Licorice decoction. At that time, there will likely be a significant sweat leading to relief. When evil qi is trapped in the chest, it can also cause cold extremities, but recognizing a pulse that suddenly becomes blocked is key. Zang-exhaustion is difficult to treat. Inquiring about the Shaoyin Four-Reversal Decoction and the Four-Reversal Powder, one might ask why there is a distinction. The answer is that, generally, in Shaoyin illness, one should not hastily use warming medicines. Although there may be a surface heat in Shaoyin disease, which Zhang Zhongjing termed late-onset fever, one can still use combinations like Ephedra and Asarum to induce sweating without turning it into a true Shaoyin syndrome. In today’s cases, when the extremities are cold but there is internal heat, Zhang Zhongjing recommends the Four-Reversal Powder. The Four-Reversal Decoction employs Aconite and Dried Ginger, while the Four-Reversal Powder focuses on reversing the cold from the extremities; patients might cough, feel palpitations, have difficulty urinating, experience abdominal pain, or suffer from diarrhea and heavy stools—all of these are signs of heat conditions."},{"anchor":"trans-36p","marker":"36p","type":"translation","text":"**Fainting and Reversal** The energy reverses and rushes upward due to the upward heat of fire.

Therefore, in winter, the pulse is heavy, short, and firm, reflecting the symptoms of this illness. If an illness of cold is still mild and has not yet reached fainting and reversal, it cannot be mistaken for heat. Likewise, if there is severe heat leading to yang fainting, it should not be interpreted as cold. For yin fainting, the original pulse and symptoms are all indicative of yin conditions: the body feels cool with no thirst, the pulse is slow, thin, and weak, with no evidence of yang conditions. For yang fainting, the original pulse and symptoms indicate yang conditions: extreme heat leads to reversal, and at times returns to warmth; even in fainting, there is agitation and thirst, with the body hot and pulse rapid.

This leads to a widespread fear of Yin conditions, causing those with suspected Yin diseases to be urgently warmed, out of fear that failure to act will invite misfortune. Yet they overlook that those with severe heat illnesses rarely escape this condition. They are unaware that the balance of Yin and Yang is what constitutes the Dao, while excess Yin or Yang results in illness. Yin and Yang achieve harmony through balance; imbalance causes disease. All things arise from the combination of Yin and Yang; therefore, excessive Yin cannot persist, and isolated Yang cannot thrive. When Yang energy is excessively strong and Yin energy is excessively weak, Yang becomes stagnant, leading to a tilt between Yin and Yang that prevents circulation. This results in cold extremities, known as Yang collapse. Thus, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"When heat is profound, the collapse is likewise profound; when heat is slight, the collapse is slight.\" He also noted: \"Collapse should be addressed from below; once the heat inside is eliminated, the collapse will improve.\""},{"anchor":"trans-38p","marker":"38p","type":"translation","text":"Thus, when the disease heat is severe, there is a corresponding coldness.

The principle states: when yin and yang are balanced, there is harmony; when imbalanced, there is disease. For example, if yang is strong and yin is weak leading to heat, should it really transform into cold, it would be like when heat dissipates and cold arises, resulting in a balance of yin and yang which should lead to recovery. How could it become a cold disease? Although the discussion on malaria mentions that when yin prevails there is cold, and when yang prevails there is heat, it means that when interior energy and external heat are combined, there is yang predominance leading to fever; and when external energy and heat are combined, there is yin predominance leading to cold shivering. Due to superficial energy being weak and interior energy being hot, excess can be harmful, so counteractions are needed, hence the shivering.

This condition does not unify between exterior and interior, hence it differs from malaria where the chills and fever are mild; they arise from the transmission of heat to yin and yang on the surface, rather than a change in the yin and yang of the disease itself. Sometimes, if the disease is heat and the cold attack is excessive, the yang qi becomes weakened and yin qi increases excessively, leading to a subsequent condition of cold; this arises from overdosing on medication rather than natural fluctuations of cold and heat. When the six qi become chaotic and manifest as disease, they do so by combining and coexisting as one illness. Wind, heat, and dryness often combine together, as do cold and dampness; however, it is rare for dissimilar natures to combine. When there is severe control leading to a combination, it is a manifestation of deficiency. For instance, when fire heat is extreme and water is used to control it, it may result in shivering; generally, this is due to excessive heat rather than cold qi, thus thirst arises indicating heat within, while shivering causes the desire to drink cold. Similarly, when fire refines metal and the heat is extreme leading to transformation into water, even though it becomes water, it is still fundamentally due to intense heat resulting in the essence of metal."},{"anchor":"trans-40p","marker":"40p","type":"translation","text":"If there is excessive dryness and heat leading to stagnation in the intestines and stomach, or if drinking too much cold liquid causes obstruction and fullness, and retained fluids fail to transform and nourish due to extreme cold accumulating in the stomach, then excessive dryness and heat obstruct the chest and abdomen, causing bloating and incessant thirst, which in turn leads to cold pain in the stomach and chest, along with vomiting of watery substances, making it difficult to swallow. Attempting to quench thirst by drinking more water leads to increased fullness and pain and worsens the vomiting, yet the thirst remains unquenched. If one refrains from drinking, the unbearable thirst creates restlessness and distress, making one wish for death. Mismanagement can lead to death, and neglecting treatment is also quite difficult. In such cases, we typically administer Da Chengqi Decoction hot to facilitate swallowing, which can relieve the stagnation in the intestines and stomach. This helps to transform and nourish the retained fluids, dispersing cold and dampness, thus allowing the stomach and intestines to regain moisture. As the heat subsides, the distress and thirst along with the bloating and vomiting cease, leading to quick relief. However, the causes of the illness must be understood.

This could arise from the illness initially being too hot, from excessive treatment leading to worsening symptoms, from a loss of cold medicine for regulation, from improper treatment methods, or from mistakenly taking hot medicine or applying excessive heat, resulting in extreme heat causing yang collapse. In such cases, administering cold medicines like the Chaihu Decoction can reduce the heat and restore the balance, alleviating the collapse. It is crucial to avoid using harmful hot and toxic drugs like silver powder or croton seeds, as they will deplete yin energy and exhaust body fluids, exacerbating dry heat and causing serious complications such as breathlessness, abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, blood overflow, or various heat transformation symptoms.

The doctor intended to use warming medicines to urgently revive the yang, fearing the disappearance of yang would lead to death. However, they did not realize this was caused by excessive heat disrupting the downward flow, and subsequently supplementing warmth exacerbated the issue. If more hot medicines were used to support the yang energy, the yin would suddenly deplete, resulting in the death of the yang energy as well; where would the yang energy be generated from then? Some might ask: Why not urgently promote a downward flow? The answer is that if the yang is excessive and attacks the yin, leading the yin to deplete first, the yang will also be exhausted. At this moment, if one attempts to induce a downward flow, both yin and yang would cease, resulting in immediate death; thus, neglecting the situation would also lead to death. However, if the condition reaches a certain point, a gentle intervention can save them; in this case, one should use cold medicines to nourish the yin and slightly reduce the yang, making sure there is no violent purging. If the yin energy can gradually recover, salvation is possible. It is advisable to use a cooling remedy, as this can encourage the gradual recovery of yin energy. How can this be determined?

The branch is the initial symptom, while the root is the fundamental cause. Thus, the classics say that the initial illness is the root and subsequent illness is the branch; the root and branch are interrelated, and treatment should first address the urgent symptoms. It is also said that the six qi serve as the root, while the three yin and three yang are branches; thus, the pathogenic qi is the root, while the affected meridians and organs are branches. The subtlety of root and branch, treating them accordingly cannot be overlooked. Hence, the classics state that knowing what opposes and aligns is crucial; when the appropriate course is taken, there are no gaps. To clearly understand root and branch ensures that all measures are apt. Ignorance of root and branch is called acting blindly. The interplay of yin and yang, and the relationship between root and branch is the pathway to knowledge. Is this not its principle? In cases of one yang and one yin, if illness manifests with fright, back pain, and sighing, it is termed wind reversal.

If one begins to experience chilly hands and feet that do not warm up, this indicates that the Yin channels are afflicted and Yang Qi is insufficient; \"Four Reversal Decoction\" can be used to warm it. It is crucial to recognize this to avoid misunderstandings. The conditions of Four Reversals and cold extremities are similar but not the same. The text states: \"Any severe case of Four Reversal cold should not be treated as diarrhea,\" indicating that Four Reversals and cold are distinctly different. Severe symptoms accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, and irritability suggest serious danger in the case of Four Reversals. Diagnosis should be conducted with care and thoroughness! Regarding cold in febrile diseases, how can it be clarified? Cold indicates a worse condition than Four Reversals.

The previous heat will inevitably be followed by reversal. The deeper the reversal, the deeper the heat; the milder the reversal, the milder the heat. Thus, it is known that when there is sinking inward, the hands and feet are in reversal. In lesser yin diseases, there is only reversal without sweating, and if one forces sweating, it will certainly move the blood, but one does not know through which channel it will exit, either through the mouth and nose or from the eyes. This is termed \"lower reversal with upper exhaustion,\" and it also refers to activating the heat. If the fever comes first and is followed by reversal, it means the heat is hidden within; if reversal comes first and is followed by fever, it means the yin has receded and the yang energy has recovered. If one initially experiences reversal, it signifies that the yang energy is insufficient while the yin energy is dominant. Generally, reversal is governed by the yin, and cold is prevalent, with distinctions of progress and retreat. The classic states: If one has reversal for five days, there will also be heat for five days. If after six days there is no reversal, recovery will occur. If fever lasts for four days and reversal lasts for three days, recovery will ensue if fever returns for four days with minimal reversal and much heat.

However, if yin energy exceeds, and yang cannot recover, there will be much cold and little heat, causing the illness to reverse. Cold is the arrival of yin energy, while heat represents the recovery of yang energy. When it comes to diarrhea, it is said that there will be cold first, then heat will emerge, and the diarrhea will surely stop, indicating that the cold must recover leading to the cessation of diarrhea. Cold is the manifestation of heat, as yang energy recovers, leading to the inevitable cessation of diarrhea. Heat, in turn, signifies the return of cold, implying that yin energy is once again prevailing, thus causing the recurrence of diarrhea.

Wang Taifu also stated that there was originally no such disease; it was later defined by \"The Book of Broad Treatments.\" In ancient texts, what we call \"kicking leg disease\" refers to the condition of syncope. However, syncope should be differentiated into two types, which are then subdivided into five organ categories. The two types are cold syncope and hot syncope. When yang energy is weak below, it leads to cold syncope; when yin energy is weak below, it results in hot syncope. Hot syncope manifests as hot hands and feet, while cold syncope manifests as cold hands and feet. Yang meridians originate from the surface of the toes, while yin meridians begin from the soles of the feet. When yang energy is strong, there is heat in the lower parts; when yin energy is strong, there is cold. Furthermore, it’s said that yang governs the exterior and syncope occurs in the interior, while yin governs the interior and syncope occurs in the exterior. This is because the energies of yin and yang are reversed and move upwards. In spring and summer, yang is abundant and yin is scarce; in autumn and winter, yin strengthens and yang weakens. People may rely on their vigor and indulge during autumn and winter, leading to a depletion of internal yang and a surplus of essence that flows downward, allowing evil energy to rise.

The effects of alcohol and food gas combine to create internal heat, leading to red urine; the energy becomes robust yet reckless. When the kidney energy is weakened and yang energy prevails alone, the hands and feet become hot and lead to heat syncope. There is also syncope that causes a person to feel abdominal fullness without awareness; some may regain awareness after one or two days, while others may suddenly become confused and lose consciousness, all due to chaos caused by external pathogens and rebellious yang energy, leading to insufficient motion in the shaoyin kidney meridian. When the kidney energy is minimal, the essence and blood scatter, forcing energy upwards into the chest cavity where the ancestral energy stagnates beneath the heart, and yang energy retreats downwards. The heat returns to the yin lower regions, assisting the yin and causing loss of sensation in the body. Moreover, the five vessels converge in the ears; if all five are blocked, it causes bodily pulses to stir while the form remains oblivious, resembling a corpse, hence it is called corpse syncope. There may be drooling like a dragging saw, with sounds in the throat representing phlegm syncope. Twitching of the hands and feet indicates wind syncope. If this occurs due to intoxication, it is called alcohol syncope; if from sudden anger, it is termed qi syncope. Bone pain and nail brittleness represent bone syncope.

Any shift from cold to heat, or if heat is deeply rooted and causes trembling, or if there is excessive cold leading to agitation, are all termed as counterflow, not limited to just cold hands and feet. The zong muscle corresponds to the yin vessels, with the liver and spleen meridians closely associated with the zong muscle. In cold counterflow, the yin contracts and the limbs are cold; in heat counterflow, the fluids dry up and fail to nourish the limbs, resulting in red urine and hot hands and feet. Thus, the counterflow of the six meridians is all unified under the liver and spleen. When the pathogenic factor from cold damage affects the three yang meridians, the limbs feel warm. If it’s half exterior and half interior, affecting the taiyin, the pathogen gradually penetrates inward, making the limbs warm. If it reaches the shaoyin counterflow, the pathogen enters deeply and remains embedded internally, leading to cold limbs. However, if heat leads to counterflow, it is heat counterflow through the channels, where mild cases can be treated with formulas like Si Ni San, Bai Hu Tang, or Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang, and severe cases may require Da Chai Hu Cheng Qi Decoction. If the pathogen abruptly clogs the chest, causing restlessness and lack of appetite along with counterflow, Guati San can help expel it. According to \"Bai Wen,\" heat counterflow and cold counterflow are different. Heat counterflow is when there is mild counterflow alongside fever. In contrast, cold counterflow presents without fever, with cold limbs, a deep and thin pulse, loose stools, aversion to cold, and blue-tinted nails. Additionally, if there is failure to descend, resulting in blocked blood flow with cold limbs leading to counterflow, a physician might misinterpret it as yin counterflow, leading to disastrous consequences if treated with formulas for counterflow like Si Ni. Generally, heat counterflow has a deep and slippery pulse, sweat on the forehead, warm palms, and warm fingertips, and is appropriately treated with downward actions.

If one excessively sweats, this leads to stomach coldness, allowing the worms to rise and attack the throat, causing a deficiency of stomach qi, resulting in an inability to eat even when hungry. When a person eats, if they vomit up the worms, it is because the worms detect the smell of food and emerge. Externally, symptoms may fluctuate between calmness and agitation, indicating that the worms may be either active or at rest. There may also be diarrhea due to cold in the internal organs, which causes the worms to move upward into the throat. Thus, when the upper part of the body is hot while the middle and lower parts are cold, symptoms of agitation, heat, and thirst may arise, accompanied by constipation.

In modern times, it is mistakenly referred to as \"foot disease,\" but upon reading this, one realizes that in ancient times, it was called foot disease. The texts say: In cold jue, the hands and feet are cold; in hot jue, the hands and feet are hot. In wei jue, there is a combination of atrophy and jue, leading to weak and powerless feet. In bi jue, there is a combination of bi illness and jue illness, resulting in stubborn numbness, swelling, and pain in the feet. Qi rebelling can be seen in prior cases of cold jue, hot jue, wei jue, bi jue, and wind jue, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, confusion, bloating, shortness of breath, numbness in the lower abdomen, or sudden loss of consciousness, which the world refers to as foot disease attacking the heart. Nowadays, people also consider sudden fainting and loss of consciousness as jue. When asked how to interpret cold hands and feet as jue, it is said, \"It is not.\" In Zhang Zhongjing's discussion of typhoid fever, a hot jue is indicated by hot hands and feet, and a cold jue by cold hands and feet, with cold being referred to as reversing. It is stated that any jue occurs when yin and yang do not harmoniously connect. Jue is characterized by the hands and feet being reversely cold. Therefore, in cases of yang deficiency that do not connect, one warms it; in cases where yang is trapped and deeply hidden, not harmonizing with yin, one purges it; where pathogenic heat invades but has not deeply penetrated, one disperses the transmitted yin heat, adjusting treatment according to the depth and severity. This pertains to the pathogenic factor of typhoid fever entering the interior, where the rebellious jue of the great yin hands and feet corresponds only to the two channels. Since it is a discussion of the pathogenic element transmitted through the six channels of typhoid, it is known that jue yin is the channel where the two yins intersect. When heat transmits to this location, it has reached an extreme depth, which is why it is called jue yin."},{"anchor":"trans-69p","marker":"69p","type":"translation","text":"The discourse in the \"Inner Canon\" on this topic is different. It states that the three yang channels originate from the surface of the five toes, while the three yin channels emerge from the inner sides of the same toes. Therefore, when the yang energy is abundant, the lower body becomes warm; when the yin energy prevails, cold rises from the toes to the knees. Regarding the cause of cold syndromes, it is said that the \"front yin\" is where the tendons gather, and it unites the taiyin and yangming channels. This occurs when a person is robust, during the autumn and winter when yin energy is strong and yang energy weakens. This results in an imbalance; the energy is depleted, and the flowing upwards is resisted, leading to an overflow of essence downward. Pathogenic energies ascend as a consequence, and the waning yang cannot nourish the meridians.

If one indulges while full, the qi accumulates in the spleen, the kidney qi gradually declines, and the yang qi predominates, resulting in heat in the hands and feet. Observing its subtle essence, it likely relates to the kidneys receiving the essence of prenatal vitality, from which the original qi is filled, resulting in the interdependence of the two organs and the flow of the vessels. The operation of yin and yang within and without occurs, each with its own duties; yang governs the warming of the exterior, while yin governs the cooling of the interior. The vessels connect and circulate through the limbs; hence, I cite the example of the spleen and stomach being harmed by alcohol and lust, leading to severe cases of yin and yang disorders at the beginning of the text. Continuing to discuss the twelve channels of reversal, one only addresses the reversal of qi in the primary channels without mentioning the heat in the hands and feet or the reasons for the sickness; these cannot be fully explained in a single statement.

Consequently, the limbs fail to receive the vital energy from food and grain, leading to progressive decline. The menstrual flow becomes unbeneficial, and the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the energy to thrive. In this context, the spleen and stomach oscillate between fullness and emptiness, with one being deficient and unable to move fluids while the other is excessive and acts independently. This independent action inevitably causes cold, which is one cause of syncope from the spleen and stomach. Furthermore, all twelve meridians draw vital energy from the stomach. If the stomach is cold, the energy in the meridians becomes cold; if the stomach is hot, the energy in the meridians becomes hot. Thus, when the meridians are not harmonized, there will inevitably be residual cold or heat at the extremities.

The \"Lingshu\" states: the Chong vessel, which shares its origin with the Shaoyin and the Great Luo from the kidneys, is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, thus all five organs and six bowels are nourished by it. The upper part of the Chong vessel nourishes Yang, and infuses essence; the lower part connects to the Shaoyin channel, moistens the three Yin, infuses the collaterals, and warms the muscles. If the collateral networks are blocked, the diaphragm becomes immobile; if it is immobile, syncope results, leading to coldness. The Chong vessel is responsible for the Yang that governs the internal functions of the kidneys; Yang is associated with fire. If this Yang moves properly, it is a minor fire that nourishes life; if it moves chaotically, it becomes a strong fire that harms, and excessive fire weakens the original true Yang. Dongyuan stated that fire and original Qi cannot coexist; when one prevails, the other is diminished. As previously discussed regarding syncope, when the Qi is downward and conflicts arise upwards, the pathogenic Qi follows, not from a separate source, but from the chaos of this fire, causing the tumultuous energies of Yin and Yang to rise in rebellion."},{"anchor":"trans-73p","marker":"73p","type":"translation","text":"Therefore, it is said that the disease of the Chong Vessel arises from reversed qi, and the pathogenic mechanisms indicate that all reversed influences ascending are associated with fire, while all collapses are associated with the lower part.

This is the pathway of the kidneys concerning collapses. As for the Chong Vessel and the stomach, both are named after the sea; hence, the diseases of collapse in the twelve vessels are all related. Additionally, other texts discussing collapses mention that excess yang qi can lead to an outburst, where essence is exhausted and accumulations form in summer, causing people to experience collapses. There are also conditions where two yangs and one yin cause wind collapse; cases where lack of determination leads to collapses; organ collapses; sudden and unrecognized collapses; and collapses where all five collaterals are exhausted. All these causes, arising from reversed evils, involve the intertwining of fire and the five types of fire, leading to disruptions in the qi of the vessels, thus resulting from the interactions of the five qi: wind, cold, dryness, dampness, and heat."},{"anchor":"trans-74p","marker":"74p","type":"translation","text":"The five energies often transform and interact with one another.

The San Jiao, foot Shao Yang, Chong, Ren, and Du meridians all govern the fire below, yet they all belong to the kidneys. Why is this? The foot Shao Yin and hand Shao Yin interact at midday, residing in between; this allows the kidney's original qi to be stabilized. If the ministerial fire is improperly activated, one must first support the kidneys and regulate the treatment to redirect the rebellious qi, differentiating the strengths of the five energies to adjust them appropriately. However, there are also cases where the body does not become cold due to the uprising of qi. As stated in \"The Original Patterns of Disease,\" yin water governs purity, thus if there is cold illness, the four limbs may feel cold. This indicates that yang is weak while yin is present, resulting in cold. This corresponds to the principle stated by Zhongjing that one experiences reversal before heat; due to the cold pathogen from the outside, the yang qi is unable to overcome it, hence the initial state of reversal.

This condition is caused by excessive sweating, leading to a deficiency of blood and qi being stagnant in the blood, with yang rising but not descending. Qi becomes blocked and fails to circulate, resulting in a death-like state. When qi returns to the blood and yin and yang are restored, consciousness returns after some time. This is called \"stagnation collapse,\" also known as \"blood collapse.\" It is often found in women.

Yang collapse supplements yin, nourishing the master of water; yin collapse supplements yang, enhancing the source of fire. These forms of yin and yang collapse differ from the yin and yang collapses associated with cold damage. In cases of cold damage, yang collapse requires the method of pushing out the old to bring in the new, while yin collapse requires the use of Fuzi to regulate the center. The differences are as pronounced as between ice and fire, with life and death within reach. When yang qi is weak and deficient, yin must compensate, causing cold to travel from the fingers to the knees, known as cold collapse. This is an inversion of cold downward, treated with Liuwu Fuzi Decoction. When yin retreats, yang advances; therefore, when yin qi weakens below, yang moves to replenish it, resulting in warmth in the feet. When the heat intensifies, it may ascend along the three yin pathways, termed heat collapse, which should be treated with Liuw Wei Di Huang Pill.

The essay on regulating the meridians indicates that both energy and blood can be deficient, revealing an imbalance of yin and yang.

The deficiency in the lower body is a true emptiness; if there are no pathogenic factors to address, then one must promptly strengthen the lower body decisively. In observing the passages of the Yangming classic regarding the linking of channels and organs, it is stated that 'reversal of qi' is significant, which is quite evident and straightforward! The linking of channels indicates that the illness lies in the muscles, hence it is light and produces symptoms; whereas, the linking of organs indicates that the illness lies at the root, thus it is heavy and fatal. Having recognized this as a reversal of qi, it can be discerned that symptoms like abrupt falls and collapses are not truly strokes, but various scholars in Hejian refer to the central organs, which leads to confusion between true and false strokes, making it difficult to distinguish. The detailed discussions in the Great Righteousness Treatise and the Subtle Analysis Treatise state: \"When the pulse reaches a state resembling panting, it indicates a pulse that is rapid and urgent like breathlessness, reflecting a condition of chaotic blood and qi, hence resulting in sudden reversal and inability to speak,\" which aligns with what people today refer to as a 'silent stroke.'"},{"anchor":"trans-79p","marker":"79p","type":"translation","text":"In Yunyang, the upper part is hot and the lower part is cold; this indicates a condition where water and fire do not interact, leading to a state of blindness, akin to dizziness caused by wind.

In the discussion of the \"End and Beginning\" chapter, it states: sudden clarity refers to sudden coldness; if it feels like being split or severed, it is described as painful and indescribable, which aligns with the so-called confusion and disturbance caused by wind. Those with heat often experience warmth and a strong pulse, thus it is advisable to clear the fire within the Yin. Those with phlegm often suffer from wheezing and have a slippery pulse, thus it is necessary to relieve the phlegm in the upper jiao. For those without fire or phlegm, they tend to feel cold and have a weak pulse, hence it is necessary to tonify the primordial Qi. In cases with such symptoms coupled with confusion and loss of consciousness, this represents a severe condition involving multiple organs, often difficult to treat.

All these are considered internal injuries.

One should primarily use formulas like Jin Zheng Qi San, Liu Qi Yin, green onion and ginger soup, or Su He Wan. A discussion on the strength and weakness of formulas concludes that counteracting the path of qi is the same as syncope. The interplay of yin and yang qi is such that yang rises from the left and yin descends from the right; therefore, for yang illnesses, the left side is more severe, and for yin illnesses, the right side is more severe.

Blood loss occurs in cases of severe bleeding or excessive blood loss during childbirth, leading to a loss of qi as well, hence causing sudden collapse and death. In such cases, one should first pinch the philtrum or burn vinegar with charcoal to gather the qi, and urgently administer one or two taels of ginseng decoction to restore the qi, ensuring it does not completely escape; this will lead to gradual recovery. Then, according to the conditions of cold or heat, one may proceed to regulate it accordingly; this is called replenishing the qi after blood loss. If one does not understand this and merely uses medicines for the blood, even a small amount of qi could suddenly dissipate, leaving the yin with nothing to support it, and thus there would be no vitality. If one considers using cold and cooling methods to stop the bleeding, it will certainly damage the yang qi, hastening death."},{"anchor":"trans-89p","marker":"89p","type":"translation","text":"Blood reversal refers to the phenomenon where blood and qi move together upwards, and it is also described as a condition where intense anger causes the manifestation of qi to be disrupted, leading to blood accumulating above. When blood is affected by reverse qi, it is essential to first regulate the qi; when qi flows smoothly, blood will follow suit. It is advisable to use formulas like Tongyu Decoction or Huagan Decoction to address this condition and, once blood circulation is restored and qi is relaxed, to treat according to the specific symptoms. When phlegm and fluids obstruct the body, causing qi to become stagnant and mental confusion, and neither medication nor food can alleviate it, one must prioritize either inducing vomiting or relieving the blockage to address the urgent condition. Once the phlegm and qi have opened slightly, one should then treat the root cause of the illness. If phlegm is caused by heat, it should be cleared and driven down; if caused by wind and cold, it should be dispersed and warmed; if caused by dampness, it should be dried and regulated; if caused by spleen deficiency, the spleen should be strengthened; if caused by kidney deficiency, the kidneys should be nourished.

Those who indulge in drinking without restraint often suffer from this illness. When their vital energy is strong and can overcome it, they do not recognize the harm of alcohol; but when they begin to weaken, the effects of alcohol become frightening. There are many ailments caused by alcohol, and their origins are unknown. When it comes to alcoholic syncope, it closely resembles a stroke: in mild cases, the person may still be aware, but in severe cases, they may suddenly collapse, become unresponsive, or exhibit sudden confusion, agitation, inability to speak, excessive phlegm, breathlessness, fever, cough, or even spitting blood. If one observes that the stools are dry and the pulse is strong and prefers cold, this indicates excess heat and dampness obstructing upward, and it is advisable to use methods like extracting the fuel (removing the underlying cause) and drinking to swiftly cool the fire."},{"anchor":"trans-91p","marker":"91p","type":"translation","text":"In cases of extreme heat, one should alternate with drinks made from pear syrup and mung bean to counteract the poison.

If due to alcohol, the yin is harmed leading to the dual deficiency of spleen and kidney, and this results in syncope, one must promptly address the root cause; otherwise, there will be no benefit. Anyone suffering from this should avoid alcohol for life, ensuring they do not let it touch their lips; ignorance of this will make relapse very difficult. There are two types of symptoms of color loss: one is sudden collapse, and the other is blood movement. The sudden collapse of color is typically due to the person being fundamentally deficient, occasionally exerting themselves to the fullest in unusual circumstances; or it may occur after a prolonged indulgence in love and desire.

This discussion is specifically about those who are in immediate distress, and indeed, such cases are not many. Yet, there are many who suffer from latent conditions. How do I know this? Because their essence diminishes over time, and their vital energy gradually depletes. Therefore, symptoms often appear two or three days after engaging in sexual activity. But since the problem does not manifest immediately, it is not viewed as an illness.

However, this is different from blood reversing due to intense anger, and thus, the treatment methods also vary. This condition often arises from the upward blazing of the desire fire, causing the blood to follow the qi upward. It typically involves strong emotional disturbances and the inability to express desires, and sometimes it involves using curative herbs to strongly suppress the excessive fire. Symptoms may include sudden and violent vomiting, nosebleeds that cannot be controlled, cold reversals, sweating, shortness of breath, or coughing—all of which result from the upward surge of yin fire. In treating this, one must first suppress the fire to control its momentum, clear the fullness, and transform excessive dampness, primarily using Four Yin Decoction or modified versions of similar prescriptions. If there is depletion of yin below and fire does not return to its source, with no other troubling heat pulse signs, and continuous blood congestion leading to a critical state, it is essential to use Zhen Yin Decoction, as it alone can provide rescue.

Yang syndrome, or heat syndrome, occurs when heat travels from the three Yang channels into the Yin system. It initially manifests as headache and fever, starting shallow and progressing deeper, eventually affecting the three Yin channels, leading to coldness in the limbs and sometimes warmth. The symptoms include constipation, restlessness, delirium, thirst, aversion to heat rather than cold, and a deep, strong pulse. This is caused by the transformation of heat in the channels; externally, the hands and feet may feel cold, but internally it is due to a pathogenic heat. When Yang syndrome manifests, it resembles Yin, hence it is called Yang syndrome. The symptoms arise from internal heat or loss of Yang at its descending point. If the syndrome is mild, the heat is also mild, and remedies like Si Ni San are appropriate; if severe, then stronger remedies like Cheng Qi Decoction are needed. Yin syndrome, or cold syndrome, does not initially show signs of heat from the three Yang channels. Instead, true cold directly invades the three Yin channels, causing aversion to cold, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, shivering, and a lack of thirst, with a deep, weak pulse. This syndrome is characterized by the absence of Yang, thus it is called Yin syndrome. For mild cases, Li Zhong Decoction is suitable, while for severe cases, Si Ni Decoction or Hui Yang Decoction are recommended.

Nowadays, people simply call it middle cold, which is indeed the disease. However, few fall into this error, and it's not difficult to understand. The treatment should be to warm the center without needing further distinction. As for Yang inversion, distinguishing it is necessary. Inversion arises from the transmission of the three Yangs, leading to Yang inversion, which is indeed the case. Even in discussing transmission through the channels, can it be said that there are no Yin conditions? Therefore, any illness resulting from true Yang deficiency is also a Yin inversion within Yang; a weak pulse with no spirit is also a Yin inversion within Yang; excessive attack or cooling leads to a Yin inversion within Yang as well. The four limbs are the roots of all Yang; unless there are symptoms like heat accumulation, restlessness, thirst, or fullness, inverted coldness indicates a deficiency of Yang energy. Cheng Wujie stated: generally, inversion is related to Yin, and is often associated with coldness. He also said: inversion is the amplification of Yin. Therefore, conditions of combined deficiency and coldness, although they may arise from the Yang channels, are still a Yin inversion within Yang. Should Yin within Yin be warmed, or should Yin within Yang be cooled? Scholars should not think that the presence of headache and fever, merely due to the transmission of the three Yangs, automatically classifies it as Yang inversion, as treating cold caused by heat would lead to significant harm."},{"anchor":"trans-96p","marker":"96p","type":"translation","text":"Hui Jue (Intestinal Twists) Cheng Wujiy stated: \"Zang Jue (Organ Collapse) leads to death, as the yang energy is severed.

In reality, it is the internal heat of the heart that cannot be released, leading to cold limbs while the chest and abdomen feel hot. The prescription consists of three qian of Chai Hu, two qian of Dang Gui, one qian of Jing Jie, two qian of Huang Lian, two qian of stir-fried Zhi Zi, one qian of Ban Xia, and one qian of Zhi Ke, which should be decocted in water. One dose will stabilize the condition, while two doses will lead to complete recovery. This is because many cases of cold limbs are due to internal fire, and intense coldness corresponds to intense heat. Thus, by relieving internal heat, the limbs will warm up. The brilliance of this formula lies in using Chai Hu as the chief ingredient, which, along with other cooling herbs, directly enters the heart and liver without causing stagnation in the chest. Chai Hu is adept at dispersing external and internal evils, and is effective in alleviating pent-up energy. Merely treating the limbs without addressing the core issue would be like capturing the underlings without catching the leader; the remaining forces would remain uncontained. Therefore, the focus should not be solely on the limbs but primarily on the heart and chest. While many cases of this condition are indeed caused by internal heat, there are also instances of coldness that lead to the same symptoms, resulting from chilled Yin entering the kidney palace. This will inevitably challenge the heart's fire with the kidney's cold water being on the rise, leading to a weakened ruling fire while the subordinate becomes strong.

In cold qi deficiency, the hands and feet will be blue, drinking water will induce vomiting, and there will be abdominal pain, with a preference for warmth for relief. In contrast, with heat qi deficiency, the hands and feet may feel cold but will not appear bluish; water will not induce vomiting, and warmth will exacerbate abdominal pain. If one can accurately diagnose and appropriately use medicine, the treatment will be effective as soon as it reaches the throat—this is the mark of a true healer, and there is no need for talismans or incantations. For treatment, if it is a case of corpse pattern due to evil qi blockage, medication must be used to open it. Do not use the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting; instead, use soapberry to provoke sneezing. Use seven gourd stems, and prepare with two bowls of water, reducing it to one bowl of decoction, adding a little salt to administer, which will induce a heavy cough with thick phlegm, resulting in cure. Alternatively, grind soapberry spines into fine powder, fill a goose feather quill with the powder, and blow it into the patient's nose.

Regarding acupuncture and moxibustion: The \"Plain Questions\" states: When the solar organ alone is affected, it leads to fainting and breathlessness due to excess yang and insufficient yin. Both the exterior and interior should be treated by purging from below. When the lesser yang organ is alone affected, it causes fainting gas. If there is sudden and severe pain, one should also purge from below. The Emperor asked: There is an affliction presenting with swelling, neck pain, chest fullness, and abdominal distension.

Qi Bo replied: Moxibustion would lead to muteness, and stone treatment would lead to madness; it is necessary for the vital energy to be united for effective treatment. The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qi Bo replied: When yang energy is excessively rising, it leads to an excess above; moxibustion directs the yang energy into the yin, causing muteness. Stone treatment depletes the yang energy, leading to madness. The treatment should be done once the energies converge to promote recovery. When cold energy invades the five organs, it causes fainting and upward leakage, resulting in depletion of yin energy. If yang energy has not entered, it can lead to sudden pain and death without awareness, but if the energy reverses, recovery is possible. Cold energy invading the intestines and stomach causes upward reversal, leading to pain and vomiting. Evil energy invades the pathways of the hands and feet, as well as the lesser yin, greater yin, and foot yangming channels. These five pathways all converge in the ear. When they are completely depleted, the body’s pulse moves while there is no awareness, resembling a corpse, which some refer to as \"corpse fainting.\""},{"anchor":"trans-124p","marker":"124p","type":"translation","text":"Insert the needle into the inner side of the big toe, at the base of the nail, where it resembles a leek leaf.

At such times, even good acupuncturists cannot alleviate the four extremities' cold. When the blood vessels congeal and are firm, they cannot move freely; hence, one cannot soften them immediately. Therefore, to treat cold, one must first warm the area, harmonizing the meridians. Adjusting the palms, armpits, feet, neck, and spine to restore balance; once the fire qi flows, the blood vessels will circulate. Then assess the condition of the pulse; those that are muddy and stagnant should be needled and leveled, while those that are firm and tight should be broken up and dispersed until the qi settles, which is known as resolving the blockage.

The practitioner first prepared a decoction of Fangfeng and Lilies (zhilong), mixing it with powdered melon seed to administer orally.

Suddenly the patient lay back, seeming to feel pain, and shortly thereafter spat out a large quantity of thick, fishy saliva. Arsenic should usually not be used; because the illness was severe, this was the only method to stimulate movement. However, without melon seeds, it should not be used casually, and care should be taken.
