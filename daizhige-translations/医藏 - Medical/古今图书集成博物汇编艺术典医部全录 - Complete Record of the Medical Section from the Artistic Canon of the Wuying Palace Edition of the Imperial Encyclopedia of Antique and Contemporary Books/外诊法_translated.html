<p><strong>External Examination Method [Observation]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The heart is associated with the vessels and its glory is reflected in color; it governs the kidneys. [Note: The heart controls the blood vessels, hence its connection to the pulse. The classics state: the pulse emerges from the qi outlet, and color is seen in the brightness of the hall. The heart&#39;s radiance manifests on the face, thus its glory is in color. The five organs correspond to the five elements, each has its mutual generation and control, with control leading to transformation. The heart governs fire and is constrained by the water of the kidneys; therefore, the kidneys are the primary source of the heart&#39;s generation, hence it governs the kidneys.]</p>
<p>The lungs are related to the skin and their glory is in the hair; they govern the heart. [Note: The lungs govern qi, which governs the exterior, hence their relation to the skin. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: a slow pulse at the wrist means the yang qi is prolonged. The sound is harmonious, and the hair grows long. Hair is attached to the skin; when qi is abundant, the hair flourishes.]</p>
<p>The liver is associated with the tendons, and its glory is in the claws; it governs the lungs. [Note: The marrow produces the liver, and the liver produces the tendons, hence the connection is in the tendons. The claws are extensions of the tendons, thus their glory is in the claws.]</p>
<p>The spleen is related to the flesh, and its glory is in the lips; it governs the liver. [Note: The spleen governs the central earth and is responsible for storage and nourishment. It governs the transformation of the essence of food and water to nourish the flesh, hence its relation to flesh. The spleen opens into the mouth, therefore its glory is in the lips.]</p>
<p>The kidneys are associated with the bones, and their glory is in the hair; they govern the spleen. [Note: The kidneys store essence and govern the marrow, hence the connection is in the bones.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Hair is the surplus of essence and blood, hence its splendor is in the hair. The discussion of the five phases states: the north produces cold, cold produces water, water produces salt, and salt produces the kidneys. The kidneys produce bone marrow, marrow produces the liver. The liver produces tendons, tendons produce the heart. The heart produces blood, blood produces the spleen. The spleen produces flesh, flesh produces the lungs. The lungs produce skin and hair, and skin and hair produce the kidneys. This is how heaven generates water and how the five organs mutually generate each other. </p>
<p>As for the energies of the five organs, the colors manifest as follows: blue like grass indicates death, yellow like the fruit of the bitter orange indicates death, black like soot indicates death, red like stagnant blood indicates death, and white like withered bones indicates death. These represent the five colors of death. </p>
<p>The five flavors are stored in the intestines and stomach to nourish the energies of the five organs. Within the five organs are the five spirits and five energies, which are externally manifested as five colors. If the energies of the five organs are injured, the deterioration of the five elements becomes apparent. The shade of grass indicates death takes on a blue hue with a hint of white; the bitter orange indicates a yellow shade with a tinge of green; soot, which is smoky dust, appears black with a hint of yellow; stagnant blood, which is congealed and foul, appears red-black; and withered bones are dead white and dried up. The five colors become dry and each bears colors that prevail over others, indicating death.</p>
<p>Conversely, blue like emerald feathers signifies life, red like a rooster&#39;s comb signifies life, yellow like a crab&#39;s belly signifies life, white like pig fat signifies life, and black like crow feathers signifies life. These are the five colors that indicate life. </p>
<p>The five colors are proper, radiant, and luminous, thus they signify life.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Born in the heart, as if wrapped in white gauze, it becomes red; born in the lungs, as if wrapped in white gauze, it becomes light red; born in the liver, as if wrapped in white gauze, it becomes deep blue; born in the spleen, as if wrapped in white gauze, it becomes the color of yellow gourd; born in the kidneys, as if wrapped in white gauze, it becomes purple. These are the external manifestations of the five organs.</p>
<p>(Note: White is pure; deep red is the color of crimson; light red is a pale hue; deep blue is a mix of blue and red; the color of yellow gourd is a reddish-yellow; purple is between red and black. These five colors all include red. The essence governs white while the manifestations govern red, as if wrapped in white gauze, the energy of the five organs is covered externally; the five colors that encompass red signify the hidden manifestations of the five organs.)</p>
<p>Colors and flavors correspond to the five organs: white corresponds to the lungs and the flavor of pungency, red corresponds to the heart and the flavor of bitterness, blue corresponds to the liver and the flavor of sourness, yellow corresponds to the spleen and the flavor of sweetness, black corresponds to the kidneys and the flavor of saltiness. Therefore, white corresponds to the skin, red to the arteries, blue to the tendons, yellow to the flesh, and black to the bones.</p>
<p>(Note: The correspondence of colors and flavors to the five organs signifies an external manifestation and an internal essence. Thus it is said that white corresponds to the lungs and the flavor of pungency represents how pungency nurtures the lungs and the lungs yield the color white. This expresses how the colors of vitality and life emerge from the essence of the five organs, and the spirit and energy of the five organs are borne from the five flavors. The lungs relate to the skin, the heart to the arteries, the liver to the tendons, the spleen to the flesh, and the kidneys to the bones. This conveys the colors born from the heart and lungs, visible through the integration of the five organs.)</p>
<p>The pulse can vary in size, slippery or rough, floating or sinking, which allows for differentiation. The imagery of the five organs can be a basis for analogy. The sounds of the five organs can be perceptively understood. Subtle diagnosis through color can be visually observed.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The ability to discern color and pulse can lead to completeness. [Note: This refers to diagnosing the conditions of the five organs by observing the pulse and color. A slight imbalance indicates deficiency of the vital energy, while a significant imbalance signifies excess of pathogenic energy; a slippery pulse indicates a blood injury, while a choppy pulse suggests insufficient energy; a floating pulse indicates an external issue in the bowels, while a deep pulse suggests an internal issue in the organs. These six types serve as key guidelines for differentiating pulses. The five organs exist internally, but their manifestations appear externally; thus, one can infer and categorize them according to the principles of the five elements. The correspondence between the five organs and the five sounds, which produce voice, can be consciously understood. The subtle observation of the five colors reveals insight, allowing internal examination through the eyes. By accurately assessing the correspondence of color and pulse to distinguish between life and death in diseases, one achieves completeness without error.]</p>
<p>In general, regarding the unusual pulses of the five colors: a yellow face with green eyes, a yellow face with red eyes, a yellow face with white eyes, and a yellow face with black eyes all indicate survival. [Note: Unusual pulses refer to the colors of the extraordinary vessels, the Chong and Ren, which are like the sea of blood and return to the liver, reflecting externally in the eyes. The face indicates the energy color, while the eyes indicate the blood color. When all five colors are present with a yellow face, it signifies the yin of the five organs while reflecting the yang of the stomach.]</p>
<p>A blue face with red eyes, a red face with white eyes, a blue face with black eyes, a black face with white eyes, and a red face with green eyes all indicate death. [Note: The classic text states: A person without stomach energy will die. The absence of yellow on the face indicates a lack of the stomach&#39;s earthly yang. The blue, black, and red colors on the face signify that the organ&#39;s evil energy has taken over the yang; being completely yin without yang leads to death. Life manifests in the heart as if wrapped in white with red; this relates to the colors of the five organs in vitality. Observing the eyes reflects the colors related to the diseases of the five organs.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>On the Transformation of Essence and Qi</strong></p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The colors and pulses are esteemed by the Supreme Deity and were transmitted by the Ancients. The path of colors and pulses is a secret held by the Supreme Deity, and it is taught only to those worthy and truly committed. The Ancients employed Jiao Dai Ji to interpret colors and pulses, communicating with the divine, integrating them with metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, not deviating from their constants. </p>
<p>The eight winds refer to the celestial eight winds, while in humans, they correspond to the five meridian winds, which regulate the evils of the five pulses. This indicates that the Ancient Masters, through the management of colors and pulses, communicated with the divine, fundamentally encompassing the constants of heaven and earth, yin and yang, four seasons, and five elements. </p>
<p>Transformation occurs in mutual exchange to observe its subtleties and to understand its essentials. To know the essentials, it can only be the colors and pulses. The color represents the essence of Qi, and the pulse is the fluid of essence. The transformation and exchange refer to the transformation of essence into Qi. Observing this transformation of essence and Qi leads to the subtleties of divine communication. To know the essential path, it is indeed the colors and pulses.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The principle of color and pulse is interlinked with the spirit, thus one can understand the fluctuations of essence and energy. Color corresponds to the sun, while pulse corresponds to the moon; consistently seeking their essence reveals the core of this relationship. </p>
<p>The sun and moon represent the essence of heaven and earth, the yin and yang. Color embodies yang, while pulse embodies yin, and the essence of their relationship ultimately revolves around yin and yang. Therefore, understanding that color corresponds to the sun and pulse to the moon reveals their fundamental importance.</p>
<p>The changes in color respond to the four seasons, which is prized by the supreme deity as it aligns with the spirit. This approach distances one from death and draws one closer to life. The way of life is long, and such a ruler is called a sage king.</p>
<p>The transformation of color, represented by the five colors corresponding to the pulse of the four seasons, arises from the pulse. Valuing and understanding the significance of color and pulse aligns with spirit, hence distancing from death and approaching life. The way of life is prolonged, and this is called the sage king.</p>
<p>The essence of treatment is to fully grasp these principles, ensuring no error in color and pulse, thereby leading to clarity in application. The fundamental method of treatment relies on this understanding. Observing the color and pulse of a patient reveals life and death without doubt, and this encapsulates the great method of treatment.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Jade Tablet Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Facial coloration appears in various directions—up, down, left, and right—each has its significance. If the coloration is shallow, the treatment involves medicinal soups, which take ten days. If it appears deep, then must be treated with balanced toxins, which take twenty-one days. If the color is profoundly deep, it requires brewed wine for treatment, lasting one hundred days. If the complexion is pale and detached, no treatment is possible, with complete decline in one hundred days. A short pulse with no breath signifies death.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The peculiar and chronic diseases arise from within the five organs, with their energy and coloration manifesting externally in the facial area according to its depth and fluctuation. Shallow colors indicate minor ailments, thus treated with soups that can restore within ten days. The principle of peculiar and chronic conditions is that all five organs draw energy from the stomach, with the spleen facilitating this transfer. When ill, the energy reverses and reflects on the face, hence the use of soups for treatment. This is based on the idea that the liquid from rice helps regenerate the earth&#39;s energies, completing one cycle in ten days to restore the energy of the five organs. Deep colors indicate deeper ailments, thus necessitating the use of powerful detoxifying medicines. The number twenty is the completion of even numbers, while one represents the beginning of life. Following another cycle of ten, one reaches a point of transformation. The five organs are yin, while the energy and color represent yang; after twenty-one days, the vital energy of the five organs has returned. Profoundly deep colors indicate even more serious illnesses.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Lao Li, the liquid of cooked grains, has a strong and vigorous essence. When consumed with alcohol, the protective energy first travels through the skin, then fills the meridians, allowing the nourishing and protective energies to circulate, thus dispersing the adverse colors. If the color is very dark, it could take ten times before it ceases. The so-called colors are manifestations that emerge from changes in the five organs, reflecting in the five colors. The energy of the five organs thrives in the meridians, and the meridians corresponding to the five energies become visible as colors. When qi and blood weaken, the complexion thins and loses its luster; hence, after a hundred days, the energy of the five organs is depleted. If the pulse is short and the energy exhausted, this signifies extreme depletion and a loss of hope. </p>
<p>Colors are observed in the upper, lower, left, and right parts, each location holding significance. The upper signifies resistance, while the lower signifies submission. For females, the right side represents resistance, and the left side represents submission. For males, the left side represents resistance, and the right side signifies submission. In the concept of change, the death of the heavy yang correlates with the death of the heavy yin. </p>
<p>Note: The section on five colors states that colors that rise represent worsening illness, while colors that descend and disperse like clouds indicate that the illness is beginning to resolve. Women represent yin, and their right side also represents yin, thus their color on the right signifies resistance while on the left signifies submission. Men represent yang, and their left side stands for yang, thus their color on the left signifies resistance while on the right signifies submission. The reversal of the left and right in men and women indicates the death of heavy yang and heavy yin.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>On the Final Discussions of the Key Points in Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of the Sun Major Meridian shows the end with pronounced symptoms: eye symptoms, reversal, and contraction. Its color is white; if sweat ceases to flow, death follows. </p>
<p><em>Commentary: The Sun Meridian governs the tendons and is the leader of all Yang energies. Yang energy, when soft, nourishes the tendons. When the energy of the Sun Meridian is exhausted, the tendons become tense, leading to eye symptoms, reversal, and pulling in the limbs. The hand of the Sun Meridian governs fluids. The bladder is where fluids are stored. If sweat ceases, fluids are lost externally. A white color indicates a loss of blood. If fluids are lost externally, blood is lost internally.</em></p>
<p>When the Lesser Yang reaches its end, there is deafness, all joints are relaxed, and the eyes seem to disconnect. When the connection is broken, one is a day and a half from death. Death manifests first in a bluish-white color before it occurs. </p>
<p><em>Commentary: The Lesser Yang governs the bones, and all joints relate to the bones. As the energy of the Lesser Yang ends, all joints relax. The text states: the Lesser Yang is where bone diseases arise, resulting in pain in all joints. The pulses of the hands and feet of the Lesser Yang reach the eyes; thus, the eyes appear startled and gaze askew. The disconnection refers to the eyes losing their connection. The Lesser Yang is associated with the kidneys, which store willpower; if the connection is broken, willpower first dissipates, leading to one and a half days of near death. The blue color indicates the escape of wood energy, while the white indicates a loss of inner nourishment from the Triple Burner. Yang emerges from Yin, and colors arise from energies; hence, as the energies of the six meridians conclude, colors manifest first.</em></p>
<p>When the Yang Brightness reaches its end, there is movement of the mouth and eyes, signs of shock, and wild speech, accompanied by a yellow color. If the upper and lower channels overflow and are unresponsive, the end follows.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The channels of the Hand and Foot Yangming connect to the mouth and eyes, hence the movements of the mouth and eyes can draw in misalignments. Hearing the sound of wood causes a startle, which is the good surprise of Yangming. Speaking harshly without regard for kinship is the folly of Yangming. The color yellow indicates the outward manifestation of Yangming&#39;s earthy essence. When the meridians above and below are abundant, stomach energy is exhausted and there is no sign of gentleness. The immune system arises from the central region&#39;s nourishment. Numbness of the skin indicates a depletion of the immune energy.</p>
<p>In the case of Shaoyin endings, the face turns black, teeth grow long and dirty. The abdomen becomes bloated and obstructed, with no passage above or below, leading to an end.</p>
<p>The heart’s brilliance is reflected in the face; if the face is black, it indicates an overabundance of water energy, extinguishing fire energy and leading to a loss of vitality. Long and dirt-covered teeth signify an excess in bone essence. Bloated abdomen with obstruction indicates that the energies of the heart and kidneys have both ceased, preventing proper exchange above and below.</p>
<p>In the case of Taiyin endings, the abdomen becomes bloated and obstructed, with difficulty in breathing, and there are tendencies towards belching and vomiting. When vomiting occurs, it is reflux, and the face turns red. When there is no reflux, there is obstruction above and below; without passage, the face turns black. The skin becomes dry and withered.</p>
<p>The Foot Taiyin channel enters the abdomen, belonging to the spleen, hence causing abdominal bloating. The Hand Taiyin channel ascends to the diaphragm, belonging to the lungs and governing respiration, resulting in difficulty in breathing. When bloated, it&#39;s difficult to elevate or descend; inability to breathe causes stagnation of energy, leading to belching and vomiting. Vomiting causes energy to rise, resulting in a red face. When there is no reflux, there is blockage within, hence obstruction above and below. If spleen energy declines, it cannot control water, causing black coloration to appear on the face. If lung energy declines, the regulation of moisture fails, resulting in dry and withered skin.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>On the Essence of Subtle Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The five colors that are vibrant are the manifestations of qi. Red should be like pure white wrapped in crimson, not like ochre; white should be like goose feathers, not like salt; green should be like the luster of a blue jade, not like blue; yellow should be like the powder of orpiment wrapped in silk, not like yellow earth; black should be like heavy lacquer, not like the color of black earth. The subtle manifestations of the five colors are seen externally, their longevity is not long.</p>
<p>The essence of the five organs lies hidden. When the true colors of the five organs become visible and are not concealed, their longevity is short. The essence and brightness are what allow one to perceive all things, distinguish between white and black, and discern short from long. If one takes the long for short, and white for black, then the essence deteriorates.</p>
<p>The head is the organ of clarity; if the head tilts and the gaze is deep, the spirit will be lost. The back is an organ in the chest; if the back curves and the shoulders follow, the organ will be damaged. The waist is an organ of the kidneys; if it twists and cannot stabilize, the kidneys will suffer exhaustion.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The knee is the connective tissue&#39;s cavity; when it cannot bend or stretch, one will walk with a stoop, and the tendons will soon weaken. The bone is the marrow&#39;s cavity; it cannot stand for long; when walking, it shakes and will weaken. If strength is gained, one thrives; if strength is lost, one perishes.</p>
<p>(Note: The essence and energy of all Yang converge at the head, and the essence of all marrow gathers in the brain, making the head the cavity of essence, marrow, and spirit. If the sea of marrow is insufficient, the head will droop; if the spirit and energy are weak, the eyes will be sunken. The shoulders and back are associated with Yang, while the chest and abdomen are associated with Yin; Yang represents cavities, and Yin represents organs. The heart and lungs reside in the chest, and the back is related to the chest, as it carries its cavity. The two kidneys are located in the lower back, making the waist the external cavity of the kidneys. The tendon meets at the Yanglingquan point, and the knee is the cavity of the tendons. Stooping and walking with support indicate weakness. Tendons are linked to the liver; when they weaken, it signifies the liver&#39;s essence and energy are depleted. The marrow is stored in the bones, so the bones serve as the cavity for the marrow. If one cannot stand for long, the marrow is exhausted internally; when the marrow is depleted, the bones will weaken. These five aspects require the strength of their cavities to thrive; without strength, the cavities decay, and the organs will perish.)</p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, and if the color is not green, it indicates a problem resulting in a heaviness in the pulse. When blood clots under the left rib, it causes difficulty in breathing. If the pulse is soft and scattered, with color and luster, it signifies a condition related to excessive fluid. Excessive fluid occurs from severe thirst leading to excessive drinking, which easily enters the muscles, skin, and intestines.</p>
<p>(Note: The liver governs blood and color. If the pulse is vigorous yet colorless, it indicates that blood is accumulated below. A condition causing heaviness or injury may arise from being struck on the hand. The blood congealing beneath the ribs consequently leads to breathing difficulties.)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The liver pulse penetrates the diaphragm and ascends to the lungs; if blood accumulates below, it causes the qi to reverse upwards, resulting in wheezing. If it is insufficient and lacks color and luster, it indicates the condition of fluid overflowing.</p>
<p>The stomach pulse is firm and long, and its color is red, indicating a condition of thigh fracture. If it is soft and scattered, it indicates a condition of food obstruction. </p>
<p>(Note: The foot yangming pulse runs from the qi at the thigh down to the foot&#39;s ankle; the pulse is strong and red due to the injury at the thigh. Food enters the stomach and corrupts in the middle jiao; insufficient stomach qi indicates a condition of food obstruction.)</p>
<p>The spleen pulse is firm and long, and its color is yellow, indicating a condition of shortness of breath. If it is soft and scattered, and lacks luster, it indicates swelling of the feet that resembles water.</p>
<p>(Note: The primordial qi of the five organs is governed by the spleen. Excessive dampness and heat produce a yellow color, a strong pulse, and shortness of breath. If it is insufficient, it indicates swelling of the feet. Spleen qi deficiency causes the swelling. The swelling resembles water yet is not a water disease, thus its color lacks luster.)</p>
<p>The kidney pulse is firm and long, and its color is yellowish-red, indicating a condition of waist fracture. If it is soft and scattered, it indicates a lack of blood, leading to its inability to regenerate.</p>
<p>(Note: The waist is the lower organ of the kidneys. An injury to the waist results in a strong kidney pulse. If an injury is to the bones, its color is reddish-yellow, thus reflecting in the interstitial muscles. If insufficient, this indicates a lack of blood. The kidneys are considered the yin organ, receiving the essences of the five organs and storing them. The essence of the kidneys rises to the heart and transforms into blood; if the essence is deficient, it fails to transform red and become blood.)<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;In cases of pre-existing illness causing disturbances in the five organs and affecting the pulse color, how can one recognize the characteristics of a newly manifested disease?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Indeed, it is a good question! When the pulse is small and its color is not depleted, it indicates a new illness; when the pulse is not depleted but its color is depleted, it indicates a chronic illness. When both the pulse and the five colors are depleted, this also indicates a chronic illness; when both the pulse and the five colors are not depleted, it indicates a new illness. If the pulses of the liver and kidney both present, and their color is dark red, this indicates injury or damage without visible blood. If blood is visible, it appears as if wet like water. </p>
<p>(Note: The reference to pre-existing illnesses due to disturbances in the pulse and color suggests a transformation upon encountering a new acute illness. Thus, the Emperor asks this question, and Qibo provides a thorough response. When the illness is longstanding, the pulse and color are affected; hence a small pulse with color not depleted indicates a new illness. The phrase &quot;not depleted but color depleted&quot; implies the disease manifested through the five organs is reflected in the pulse and seen through the color. The decline in the pulse and color is influenced in reverse; the pulse reflects the organs. When both the pulse and the five colors are depleted, it signifies damage to both blood and qi, thus indicating a chronic condition. An acute illness comes from outside to inside, while the damage to color and pulse affects from inside to outside, indicating that when both color and pulse are not depleted, it is recognized as a newly acquired illness. This indicates that in a longstanding illness, the qi of the five organs becomes active before it is reflected in the pulse and color. Damage to muscles and bones causes both the liver and kidney pulses to be present, showing dark red. Absence of visible blood means injury to muscles and bones without affecting the blood. If blood is seen, and the blood is affected, it is akin to an injury to the heart, and the heart pulse will also be present.)<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p>
<h3>Commentary on the Signs of the Common Person</h3>
<p>If the arms show many blue veins, it indicates blood loss. If the neck veins throb and there are symptoms of wheezing and coughing, it indicates water retention. If the eyes appear slightly swollen, resembling the appearance of a silkworm lying down, it also indicates water retention. If the urine is yellow and red, and the person can lie down comfortably, this indicates jaundice. If one feels hungry after eating, it indicates stomach jaundice. If the face is swollen, it indicates wind. If the legs and feet are swollen, it indicates water retention. If the eyes are yellow, this indicates jaundice. </p>
<h3>Commentary on the True Organs</h3>
<p>If the major bones are dry and shriveled, and the major muscles have sunken, with fullness of qi in the chest causing difficulty in breathing, this indicates that the symptoms are severe and the person is likely to die within six months. When the pulse of the true organs is observed, it indicates a prognosis. </p>
<p>The major bones refer to the bones of the arms and legs, while the major muscles refer to the muscles of those limbs. The kidneys govern the bones, and the spleen and stomach govern the muscles of the four limbs. The qi of the stomach nourishes the five organs, which is known as the ancestral qi. Ancestral qi accumulates in the chest and is conducted through the deep channels to the twelve meridians. When the meridians are obstructed, this results in qi fullness in the chest. If yangming qi is obstructed, it causes difficulty in breathing. The movement of the qi demonstrates a heart condition that wishes to transmit to the lungs, as the lungs govern qi, leading to increased breath and movement.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The expectation is that one who is to die in June will begin to feel it in the heart, which will then transmit to the lungs, the lungs to the liver, the liver to the spleen, and the spleen to the kidneys before death occurs, hence the duration of six months. The pulse of the genuine organs becomes firm and beats strongly, like the rhythm of adzuki beans densely packed. I predict that the death will occur during the midnight of the Ren-Kui day.</p>
<p>The great bones are withered, the flesh has sunk down, the chest is full of qi, breathing is labored, and there is internal pain radiating to the shoulder and neck; the expectation is death within a month. When the genuine organs are observed, I provide the expected date of death.</p>
<p>(Annotation: This indicates that a liver disease has progressed to the lungs, causing internal pain as the lungs are affected. The pain radiates to the shoulders due to the lung&#39;s association with the back. The liver disease has transmitted to the organs it controls, hence the expectation of death within this month. The pulse of the genuine organs resembles the sharpness of a blade or the tension of strings on a zither. I predict death will occur at dusk on a Geng-Xin day.)<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Great bones wither and dry, large flesh sinks down, the chest is full of air and breathing is difficult; there is internal pain radiating to the shoulders and neck, the body feels hot, and the flesh is falling apart (indicating serious injury). When the true organs are visible, death is expected within ten days.</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to lung disease, hence the pain radiating to the shoulders and back. The disease impacts the heart, resulting in body heat. The heart governs blood and is nourished by the essence of the kidneys. If the blood and energy are abundant, it fills the skin and flesh; but if the heart and kidneys are damaged, the essence and blood decline, hence the description of flesh falling apart (serious injury). As the true organs are weak and visible, they appear large but empty, akin to a person with downy feathers. The illness attacks the heart, leading to a prognosis of death within ten days; thus, the heart, not being affected by the evil influences, causes fast death.)</p>
<p>Great bones wither and dry, large flesh sinks down, the marrow in the shoulders diminishes, and movement becomes increasingly weak; when the true organs become visible, expect death in one year. A prognosis is given based on the visibility of the true organs.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The spleen governs the movement of fluids in the stomach, nourishing the bones and benefiting the marrow of the brain. When the spleen is diseased and fluids do not circulate, the essence of the shoulders is internally consumed first. The essence of the shoulders is the marrow of the Dazhui vertebra, converging with the brain; thus, when the neck bones tilt, it is a sign of death and cannot be treated. The spleen governs the limbs; when the spleen is unhealthy, the limbs become weak, thus reducing movement. The true organ manifests like the flow of water and the pecking of a crow. The spleen corresponds to the four seasons, and its energy nourishes the five organs; therefore, even if the true organ appears, one can still expect a year of life. This is because the energies of the four seasons and five organs must cease before death. On the day when death is expected, there is a fluctuating appearance of the true organ, and I predict the date, suggesting that death will occur soon after dawn.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The large bones are withered and the flesh sinks down; the chest is filled with qi, the abdomen is painful, and there is discomfort in the heart. The shoulders and neck feel hot, the flesh is breaking down, and the eye sockets are sunken. The true pulse is seen, but one does not see a person standing alive; when one sees someone, if the moment surpasses their endurance, then they will die.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This text states: For kidney disease, there is pain in the lower abdomen. The kidneys influence the heart, hence the discomfort in the heart. The heart influences the lungs, and the lungs influence the liver, thus causing shoulder and neck heat. The liver influences the spleen, resulting in sunken eye sockets. The true pulse is felt, fluctuating and then stopping, resembling the sound of a stone being flicked. When one cannot see a person, it implies that the kidney&#39;s essence and qi have been depleted, hence they fall dead. If a person is seen, it indicates that residual qi remains; when they reach their limit, they will die, commonly referred to as dying at sunset.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The kidneys are the source of life energy; when life energy diminishes below, death occurs more swiftly. The true liver pulse is urgent both internally and externally, akin to following the edge of a knife, strikingly like pressing the strings of a zither; it appears greenish-white and lacks luster, and hair loss leads to death. The true heart pulse is firm and beating, as if following the layers of adlay seeds; it appears reddish-black and lacks luster, and hair loss leads to death. The true lung pulse is large and hollow, like a feather touching human skin; it appears whitish-red and lacks luster, and hair loss leads to death. The true kidney pulse is strong and abrupt, like fingers plucking stone; it appears blackish-yellow and lacks luster, and hair loss leads to death. The true spleen pulse is weak and occasionally rapid, occasionally sparse; it appears yellowish-green and lacks luster, and hair loss leads to death. All true organ pulses, when observed, indicate death with no treatment possible. </p>
<p>(Note: Phrases like &quot;following the edge of a knife&quot; and &quot;pressing the strings of a zither&quot; illustrate the nature of the liver&#39;s essence. Comparisons like &quot;adlay seeds&quot; and &quot;plucking stone&quot; represent the heart and kidneys, respectively.)<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>All are extremely firm and strong, lacking any softness or gentleness. At times dense, at times sparse, they desire to be nourished yet cannot; it is a sign of the disposition on the verge of collapse. Like feathers and human skin, it represents the weakness and dissipation of lung energy. The firmness and strength, along with the dissipation, cannot receive the harmony of stomach energy; without stomach energy, one cannot live. The colors are pale blue and white without luster, red and black lacking shine, all indicative of being diminished and defeated. Colors arise from blood vessels; due to the near depletion of energy, they cannot shine. The energy flows through the vessels, and the energy returns to the lungs. The lungs govern the hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin and hair, and the hair vessels receive this essence before circulating energy to the organs; when the energy of the organs is about to be depleted, the hair must inevitably become frail and scorched. The “Spiritual Pivot” states: &quot;When blood is dominant, it becomes thin and seeps through the skin, producing fine hair.” It also states: &quot;When the channels are empty, blood energy weakens and withers.” The intestines and stomach are weak, the skin is thin and delicate.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Hair and skin decay lead to a predetermined death. When the skin and hair fail, it is due to the early cessation of blood and vital energy. In treating illness, one should examine the patient&#39;s shape, energy, color, and the strength of their pulse, as well as the age of the illness, before proceeding with treatment, without delay. </p>
<p>The five organs communicate in varying depths; the stomach&#39;s energy is dependent, with both deficiency and cessation. Thus, one must discern the patient&#39;s shape, energy, color, and pulse, and treat urgently to avoid an untreated condition leading to death. </p>
<p>When the shape and energy are in harmony, it is deemed treatable. If the color and luster are superficial, it indicates an easier condition. </p>
<p>When the shape and energy are in discord, it is regarded as difficult to treat. If the color is pale and lacks luster, it indicates a more serious condition. </p>
<p>The harmony of shape and energy indicates a recent illness, whereas discord implies a long-standing issue. Lack of color and luster suggests a deeper condition.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Three Divisions and Nine Conditions</strong></p>
<p>When the five visceral organs have already deteriorated, their color must be pale, and if so, death is imminent. </p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Pale&quot; refers to the color of death. This indicates that the form and energy of the five organs are derived from their physical constitution; their external manifestations arise from the inner workings of the five organs.] </p>
<p>One must first assess the heft and slenderness of the form to adjust the balance of its energy. If it is excessive, one must expel it; if it is lacking, one must supplement it. Blood vessels must be addressed before adjustments can be made. Regardless of the ailment, the goal is to achieve equilibrium. </p>
<p>[Note: A person who is overweight has abundant blood and energy, with firm skin; their energy is sluggish and slow, so treatment requires deep and prolonged stimulation. A thin person has thin skin and little color; their blood is clear, and energy is smooth, making them more susceptible to loss of energy and blood; treatment here should be shallow and swift. An excess indicates strong pathogenic influences, while a deficiency signifies a loss of essence. To expel excess, one must confront and remove it; to supplement deficiency, one must pursue and restore it. Addressing blood vessels means removing any stagnations. In any case, treatment must begin by addressing the blood, then relieving the patient&#39;s suffering. Afterward, one can expel excess and replenish deficiency, with no need to question the feasibility of the ailment, as the focus must be on restoring balance and peace in energy before proceeding with needles.]</p>
<p>Those with robust forms and weak pulses but insufficient air are in danger. Those with slender forms and large pulses but excessive internal air are at risk of death. Life is found in the balance between form and energy.</p>
<p>[Note: A robust form with a firm and large pulse indicates stability. A robust form with a small or weak pulse indicates a decline in energy. If this decline continues, danger follows.]<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The &quot;Classic of Needling&quot; states: When the body becomes emaciated due to illness, and the qi overwhelms the form, death follows. When the form overwhelms the qi, danger arises. For a slender form indicates weakened righteous qi. A strong pulse indicates an ingress of pathogenic qi. If there is excess qi in the chest, it means qi is overpowering the form. When qi dominates, it signifies that the pathogenic qi is rampant and the righteous qi is depleted. </p>
<p>Life, as dictated by Heaven, establishes the form and qi, and the harmony between form and qi is essential. If a person&#39;s pupils are prominent, it indicates insufficiency of the sun (yang). If there are sunken eyes, the essence of the sun is already exhausted. This is a critical determinant of life and death, not to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the nine needles and the nine conditions emphasizes the connection between spirit and qi. The heart houses the spirit and is the sun among the yang; the kidneys are the source of vital qi, with the bladder reflecting it. Thus, primarily assessing the sun-like functions of the hands and feet is critical since the sun governs all yang energies. Prominent pupils indicate a deficiency in the spirit of the sun. The pulse of the hand solar channel extends from the cheek to the sharp corner of the eye, and its branches reach from the nose to the inner corners of the eyes. If it is deficient, the channel energy becomes urgent, leading to prominent pupils. </p>
<p>The pulse of the foot solar channel originates from the inner corners of the eyes; when qi is cut off, death is inevitable, thus resulting in sunken eyes. Although the energies of the hand and foot channels in the yang interact and connect, any deficiency in the hand channel stems from the decline of vital qi, manifesting as depletion in the lower body leading to the upper body failing first. Therefore, deficiencies in the upper body should be nourished, while complete cessation in the lower body signifies death. The analogy states that when trees bloom, their leaves sprout, whereas when strings break, their sound becomes hoarse.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Discussion on the Theory of Emptiness and Fullness</p>
<p>When there is emptiness in the lower part of the body, one’s steps will become unsteady.<br>[Note: The emptiness referred to here means that the vital energy is deficient below. &quot;Unsteady&quot; indicates a state of weakness or timidity. When the Yangming energy is deficient in the lower part, it causes a person’s steps to be unsteady. This is because the lower half of the body is mainly governed by the Taiyin and Yangming principles.]<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>The Heat Identification Treatise</strong></p>
<p>In cases of liver heat disease, the left cheek turns red first. For heart heat disease, the face turns red first. In cases of spleen heat disease, the nose turns red first. For lung heat disease, the right cheek turns red first. In kidney heat disease, the jaw turns red first. </p>
<p>**[Note: Each internal organ corresponds to a specific area: The liver belongs to wood and is located in the east, hence the left cheek turns red first. The face refers to the forehead; the heart corresponds to fire and is situated in the south, thus the face turns red first. The spleen belongs to earth, which is centered, so for spleen heat disease, the nose turns red first. The lung belongs to metal and is positioned in the west, hence the right cheek turns red first. The area below the jaw is referred to as the jaw, and the kidney belongs to water located in the north, leading to the jaw turning red first.] </p>
<p>When the Taiyang pulse is bright, it indicates a heat disease. If the brightness has not yet crossed, it is said: “For now, one can expect to sweat, just wait for the right moment.” If the pulse conflicts with the Jueyin pulse and presents together, the death will not extend beyond three days. The internal heat connects to the kidneys; this is the color of the Shaoyang pulse.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: In Taiyang diseases, the pulse is floating. Observing the Taiyang pulse indicates that the disease initiated on the exterior Yang, which subsequently leads to heat disease elsewhere. The red color observed between the cheeks is an indicator of internal heat originating from the five organs. “Bone” refers to conditions that are still internal yet subtly visible under the skin. At this time, the colors of the five organs have not yet intersected with the exterior Yang energy, nor has the exterior Yang heat merged with the energy of the five organs.]</strong><a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>A skilled physician says: For illnesses that occur in the Taiyang (greater yang), sweating from the exterior can help relieve heat. When the affliction is within the five organs, if one has not yet shown symptoms but sees a reddish complexion, one should perform acupuncture on those points, which is referred to as treating the unmanifested disease. If one can induce sweating, it is permissible to wait for the right moment. However, if one does not urgently relieve the heat through sweating, the Taiyang heat will intertwine with the internal organ heat, and the pulse of Taiyang will clash with that of Jueyin (lesser yin); the death will not be long in coming, not exceeding three days. </p>
<p>The Shaoyang (lesser yang) is associated with the kidneys, as the energy of Shaoyang originates from the kidneys. Therefore, if a fever relates to the kidneys, it shows in the color of the Shaoyang pulse. The pulse of Shaoyang will display a rosy complexion on the cheeks, indicating heat illness. If the color is not yet combined, we say one can afford to wait for the appropriate time to induce sweating. If the pulse clashes with that of Shaoyin (lesser yin), the death will also be a matter of three days. </p>
<p>Note: The external appearance of the Shaoyang pulse indicates a heat illness of Shaoyang. A rosy complexion on the cheeks is a heat illness of the kidneys. </p>
<p>If the color below the cheeks rises towards the temples, it indicates major stagnation; if it descends to the molars, it signals abdominal fullness; if it rises behind the temples, it indicates lateral flank pain; if it rises on the cheeks, it relates to the upper diaphragm. </p>
<p>Note: If the color below the cheeks rises towards the temples, it shows kidney heat affecting the liver and represents major stagnation. If it descends to the molars, it indicates kidney heat affecting the stomach, which leads to abdominal fullness. If it rises behind the temples, it indicates heat evils affecting the gallbladder, resulting in flank pain. </p>
<p>If the color rises on the cheeks, it indicates issues concerning the heart and lungs above the diaphragm. Therefore, when the heat of the five organs manifests as color in the facial features with the presence of external pathogenic heat, one should treat it before it develops into a full-blown illness, and avoid allowing the internal and external factors to combine, resulting in an irretrievable state of death.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</h3>
<p>Those with water qi will first show slight swelling beneath the eyes. Water represents yin, and the area beneath the eyes is also yin. The abdomen is where the extreme yin resides; hence, when water accumulates in the abdomen, it will inevitably cause swelling beneath the eyes.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;great yin&quot; signifies the extreme yin. When the water pathogen ascends from the abdomen, it initially harms the stomach and gradually affects the spleen, culminating in slight swelling beneath the eyes. The spleen is responsible for containment.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Pain</h3>
<p>The five viscera and six bowels each have their areas. Observing their five colors: yellow and red indicate heat, white indicates cold, and greenish-black indicates pain; this is what can be visually discerned.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The qi and colors of the five viscera and six bowels are all reflected on the face, correlating to specific areas. By observing these five colors, one can identify illnesses. When there is heat, the color appears yellow or red. Cold causes blood to congeal and weep, leading to a pale and ashen face. Greenish-black is the color of stagnation due to cold yin, hence it signifies pain.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Emaciation<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></h3>
<p>The disease of atrophy has various manifestations based on the heat in the five organs: </p>
<ul>
<li>In cases of lung heat, the color is pale and the hair is frail.</li>
<li>In cases of heart heat, the color is red and the veins are swollen.</li>
<li>In cases of liver heat, the color is yellow and the nails are brittle.</li>
<li>In cases of spleen heat, the color is yellow and the flesh is in motion.</li>
<li>In cases of kidney heat, the color is black and the teeth are decayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Note: The causes of atrophy are all due to heat in the five organs leading to exhaustion of fluids, which fail to nourish the muscles, veins, bones, and flesh. Some atrophy comes from lung heat causing internal heat in the five organs; others arise from internal sorrow and exhaustion or external heat leading to depletion of essence and blood, thus causing organ heat. Diagnosis should be based on appearance. Nails are related to tendons, and teeth are remnants of bones.]</p>
<p>In the Great Treatise, it is stated that if the pulse feels like decayed earth and does not yield to pressure, it indicates insufficient muscle qi. When the five colors show black first, it signifies death and decay.</p>
<p>[Note: Decayed earth refers to stubborn, collapsed soil. The spleen governs muscles; if it feels like decayed earth and does not yield, it reflects a lack of manifestation of qi. Earth is central and corresponds to the four seasons; if black appears first among the five colors, it indicates that earth has decayed and water energy has taken over. &quot;Decayed&quot; refers to the color white, which corresponds to the spring season. If white decays, it means the wood energy is strong and the energy of decayed earth is completely diminished.]</p>
<p>In the Pulse Resolution chapter, it is stated that a face black like earth indicates that autumn qi is internally depleting and thus causing a change in color.</p>
<p>[Note: During autumn, the yin qi emerges, depleting the stored yin. When yin qi prevails, the face appears black like earth.]<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Skin</strong></p>
<p>The yang of the Yangming is referred to as &quot;harmful flying.&quot; The upper and lower parts follow the same principle. If one examines the floating channels within the skin, all belong to the yangming channels. If the color is predominantly green, there is pain; if mostly black, there is numbness; if yellow or red, there is heat; if predominantly white, there is cold. If all five colors are present, it indicates the presence of both cold and heat. If the channels are excessive, they invite pathogens into the meridian. Yang governs the exterior, while yin governs the interior.</p>
<p>[Note: The yang channels of Yangming are referred to as harmful flying. &quot;Flying&quot; denotes movement. Yangming pertains to noon, the time of full yang, akin to the movement of all things. When yang is at its peak and yin energy increases, it is detrimental to the flying movement, hence the name harmful flying. The upper and lower parts follow the same principle, implying that the channels of the hands and feet share this method. Within the region of the skin, one observes that the initial manifestation of pathogens occurs within the skin, followed by the floating channels; if they linger, they later transfer to the meridians. Therefore, examining the floating channels of the skin, if predominantly green, it signifies pain; if mostly black, it indicates numbness; if yellow, there is heat; if white, cold prevails. The presence of all five colors suggests both cold and heat. If the channels are excessive and do not expel the pathogen, it will invade the meridian. In the areas corresponding to Yangming, this leads to ailments of Yangming; in the areas corresponding to Shaoyang, it results in ailments of Shaoyang; in the regions corresponding to the Three Yin, it results in ailments of the Three Yin. Manifestations seen on the skin represent the channels, which are yang and govern the exterior; while those found in the muscles and bones represent the meridians, which are yin and govern the interior. Those conditions of yang can be resolved externally, while those of yin must be approached from within and reside in the organs.]<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Meridians and Collaterals</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The sight of the collaterals and meridians displays five different colors: green, yellow, red, white, and black. What is the reason for this? Qi Bo replied: The meridians have constant colors, while the collaterals change unpredictably. </p>
<p>[Note: The reason for the five colors of the collaterals and meridians being different, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, cold, and dampness, is that the meridians have the constant colors of the Five Elements, whereas the collaterals vary with the change of the four seasons.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What are the constant colors of the meridians? Qi Bo said: The heart is red, the lungs are white, the liver is green, the spleen is yellow, and the kidneys are black; these correspond to the colors of their respective meridians. </p>
<p>[Note: The term &quot;meridians&quot; refers to the twelve primary meridians. The five viscera have their respective colors, corresponding to the constant colors of green, yellow, red, white, and black in their meridians.]<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;Do the Yin and Yang of the collateral vessels correspond to their meridians?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The color of the Yin collaterals corresponds to their meridians; the color of the Yang collaterals changes unpredictably, following the four seasons.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The Emperor inquires whether the collateral vessels correspond to the five organs in color as the meridians do. The Yin collaterals, belonging to the six Yin meridians, correspond to the meridians of the five organs, each having a fixed color and remaining unchanged. The Yang collaterals, belonging to the six Yang meridians, relate to the Yang of the six bowels and change with the seasons: spring is green, summer is red, autumn is white, and winter is black, which can also vary. These represent the constant colors of the five elements and four seasons, referred to as &quot;without disease.&quot; If during the seasons the collaterals of the five organs show blue-black, it indicates cold; if they show yellow-red, it indicates heat.] </p>
<p>When cold predominates, there is condensation and weeping, leading to a blue-black appearance; when heat predominates, there is muddiness and a yellow-red appearance. These are all constant colors, referred to as &quot;without disease.&quot; The presence of all five colors indicates &quot;cold and heat.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Condensation and weeping&quot; and &quot;muddiness&quot; refer to the blood and qi within the collaterals.]<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Prosperity and Decline</h3>
<p>Therefore, if one fails to address the yin, one cannot attain the yang, leading to extinction. Gaining the yang without the yin results in a lack of profound learning. Knowing the left but not the right, knowing the right but not the left, knowing above but not below, knowing before but not after—this is why governance cannot last. Knowing the ugly, knowing the good, knowing illness, knowing health, knowing the high, knowing the low, knowing sitting, knowing rising, knowing action, knowing stillness. When applied with principles, the diagnosis is thorough, and for countless generations, one remains unthreatened, understanding what is abundant and what is lacking. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The path of diagnosis involves the interplay of yin and yang, and the consideration of left and right, front and back, up and down in theory, as detailed in the precise chapter on pulse. The concepts of ugliness and goodness pertain to the presence of virtue and vice in pulse evidence. Conditions of excess are manifested in action, while those of deficiency tend toward sitting and lying down. Knowing the reasons for abundance allows one to understand the causes of deficiency. By grasping this, one can comprehend others; knowing one leads to knowing ten.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>To assess conditions, one must examine the upper and lower parts; the pulse changes due to various factors. Therefore, when the body is weak and the energy is deficient, death occurs. If the body and energy are sufficient but the pulse is insufficient, death will also occur; conversely, if the pulse is sufficient but the body and energy are lacking, life may continue. </p>
<p>This implies that one should first evaluate the communication between the upper and lower parts and then thoroughly investigate the changes in pulse, allowing for an understanding of weak bodies and deficient energy leading to death. Regardless of the stability of the pulse, one must consider the condition of the body and energy to ascertain outcomes. </p>
<p>Thus, diagnosis involves broad principles; there are consistent patterns for sitting and rising. There are rules for movement and entering or exiting, which help to focus the mind. One must observe with clarity and stillness, watching both the upper and lower aspects. There are principles governing the eight categories of health and disease, and distinctions among the five central organs. One should assess the pulse in terms of movement and stillness, considering its quality—such as the smoothness, slipperiness, harshness, coldness, or warmth.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Observe its size and relate it to the illness. By following or opposing, one can identify the name of the disease. Diagnosis can be complete without losing the essence of humanity. Therefore, when diagnosing, one may observe the breath and intention, thus maintaining clarity. The principles are very clear, enabling longevity. Not understanding this principle leads to the loss of the foundational truths. Speaking carelessly and having baseless expectations is said to be a loss of the path.</p>
<p>(Note: The commentary explains that to turn one&#39;s spirit is to use one&#39;s own spirit to gauge the other&#39;s condition. Observing from above and below is akin to looking into an abyss or at floating clouds. The &quot;eight correct&quot; refers to the sun, moon, stars, and the seasonal energies. In distinguishing the five divisions, one first distinguishes the pulses of the five organs. By assessing the pulse&#39;s movement and stillness, one can gauge its floating or sinking, speed, and rhythm. Following the characteristics of the pulse, such as smoothness or thickness, is indicated by the condition of the skin on the wrist, with smoothness suggesting a smooth pulse and thickness suggesting a thicker one.)<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>The skin that is smooth and moist is affected by wind; skin that is dry indicates wind obstruction. When the pulse is hot and very restless, this signifies a warm disease; when the pulse is cold and small, it indicates a deficiency of qi. If the skin is initially hot and then cold, this indicates alternating cold and heat; if it starts cold and later becomes hot, this also reflects alternating cold and heat. Therefore, a skilled practitioner does not rely solely on the pulse at the wrist, and a good pulse diagnostician does not depend on color alone. Those who can analyze and synthesize these elements are true masters. </p>
<p>By observing the size of the pulse, one correlates it with the disease&#39;s characteristics. The underlying cause of the condition is the extraordinary and constant ailments. If the signs are contrary, the spirit does not return; if it returns, it does not turn. If one can accurately identify the name of the illness, then the diagnosis can be perfect, without losing sight of human feelings. </p>
<p>Observing the breath means monitoring the incoming and outgoing breathing, as well as the pulse&#39;s ebb and flow. Observing intent involves closing doors and windows to focus on the patient, asking questions to gauge their feelings in accordance with their intentions. Gaining the spirit signifies prosperity, while losing it implies demise. Speaking recklessly leads to the loss of clarity in thought. Not understanding the principles of diagnosis results in falsehoods regarding life and death. This neglects the essential teachings and disregards the proper path.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>On the Subtle Understanding of Essence</strong></p>
<p>The heart is the essence of the five organs, the eyes are its openings, and the complexion is its glory. Thus, when a person has virtue, their energy is harmonious in the eyes, and their worries and knowledge are shown in their complexion. </p>
<p>[Note: The five organs are responsible for storing essence. The heart is the master of the five organs and six bowels, thus it is the essence of the five organs. The heart opens to the eyes, hence the eyes are the openings of the heart. The &quot;Treatise on Generation of the Five Organs&quot; states: “The heart connects with the pulse, its glory is in color, and it governs the kidneys.” Therefore, the beauty of complexion is the glory of the heart. Those with virtue are seen in their complexion, revealing the harmony of the heart&#39;s energy.]<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of the Unchanging Pivot</strong></p>

<p>Observe its color, examine its eyes, and understand its dispersion and return. unified in form, listen to its movements and stillness, and discern its deviations and correctness. [Note: This refers to the advanced practitioner observing the five colors in the eyes. Knowing the dispersion and return of the colors, one understands the variations of the illness. Knowing the deviations and correctness refers to discerning the winds of deficiency and correctness.]</p>
<p><strong>On Deviant Qi, Zang-Fu, and the Form of Illness</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, saying: &quot;I have heard that by observing its color, one can know the illness; this is called &#39;brightness.&#39; By palpating its pulse, one can know the illness; this is called &#39;spirit.&#39; By inquiring about the illness, one can determine its location; this is called &#39;expertise.&#39; I wish to know how to see and understand this, how to palpate and obtain this, how to inquire and fully comprehend it; what should I do?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The color and pulse correspond to the inch (pulse position), just as the impacts of drumsticks correspond. They must not be separated. This is the checking of the roots and leaves of the plant; hence, if the roots die, the leaves will wither. Color, pulse, and form must not be separated. Thus, knowing one leads to expertise, knowing two leads to spirit, and knowing three leads to both spirit and brightness.&quot; The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear the conclusion!&quot; Qi Bo answered: &quot;If the color is blue, the pulse is string-like. If red, the pulse is hook-like. If yellow, the pulse is alternate. If white, the pulse is fine. If black, the pulse is stone-like. If one sees the color but cannot discern the pulse, and mistakenly identifies the pulse that opposes it, it will lead to death; if one finds the pulse that corresponds positively, then the illness is resolved.&quot;<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The essence and brightness of the five colors are the manifestations of vital energy, arising from the spiritual energies of the five organs and five elements. The pulse is the pathway through which nourishing blood flows. The &quot;寸&quot; refers to the blood and energy outside the pulse, circulating along the channels of the hand’s yangming and manifesting on the skin of the wrist. The internal blood and energy travel through the channels of the hand’s taiyin and manifest at the &quot;寸,&quot; all of which arise from the energy and blood produced by the stomach and organs, reflecting the roots and leaves of life.</p>
<p>The physical body corresponds to the skin of the wrist. Understanding the three elements of color, pulse, and wrist leads to clarity and insight. The colors blue, yellow, red, white, and black correspond to the energies and colors of the five organs and five elements. The terms &quot;弦&quot; (xian) and &quot;钩&quot; (gou) represent the patterns of the pulses of the five organs and elements, reflecting mutual responses like shadows.</p>
<p>Thus, when the color is blue, the pulse is like xian; when red, it resembles gou. Observing the colors reveals the corresponding pulses, uniquely following the path of earth in harmony with heaven. If blue is present but the pulse shows characteristics of &quot;毛&quot; (毛脉), and if red contrasts with the traits of &quot;石&quot; (石脉), this indicates an imbalance of yin and yang, resulting in illness. Conversely, if blue matches with the traits of &quot;石&quot; and red aligns with &quot;代,&quot; this signifies that the color arises from the pulse, yang comes from yin, and the proper way is followed, thus the illness is resolved.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p>
<h3>Meridian and Vessels</h3>
<p>When the qi of the Hand Taiyin is exhausted, the skin and hair become desiccated. The Taiyin is responsible for circulating warmth and qi to the skin and hair. Thus, when the vitality does not nourish, the skin and hair become desiccated, leading to a loss of fluids at the skin&#39;s joints. When fluids are lost at the joints, the claws dry out and the hair breaks. When the hair breaks, it signifies the initial death of the hair. In the fire of Bing and Ding, metal is overpowered. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The qi of the Hand Taiyin governs the skin and hair; therefore, when the qi is exhausted, the skin and hair become desiccated. The Hand Taiyin governs qi, which is responsible for nourishing and moistening the skin and hair. Thus, it is the Taiyin that circulates warmth and qi to the skin and hair. Therefore, when the vitality does not nourish, the skin and hair become desiccated. Fluids follow the Sanjiao to warm the muscles, moistening the bones and skin. Without nourishment, fluids are lost at the joints, leading to the drying of claws and breaking of hair. The initial death of hair indicates that the qi of the Hand Taiyin has been exhausted externally. In the fire of Bing and Ding, the qi of the lungs perishes internally.</strong> </p>
<p>When the qi of the Hand Shaoyin is exhausted, the pulse is obstructed. If the pulse is obstructed, the blood does not flow; if the blood does not flow, the complexion becomes dull. Hence, if the face is black like burnt wood, it indicates that the blood has already perished. In the water of Ren and Gui, water overcomes fire. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The heart governs blood and vessels; thus, when the qi of the Hand Shaoyin is exhausted, the pulse is obstructed. The pulse flows with air, so when it is obstructed, the blood does not flow. The heart&#39;s combination with the pulse reflects its vitality and color. The hair is borne of blood and qi; hence, if the blood and pulse do not flow, the complexion becomes dull, rendering the face like burnt wood. When the Shaoyin qi is exhausted, the blood perishes first. In the water of Ren and Gui, the fire qi of the heart is extinguished.]</strong><a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>When the energy of the Foot Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse fails to nourish the muscles. The lips and tongue are the foundation of the muscles; if the pulse does not nourish, then the muscles become soft. When the muscles are soft, the flesh withers, and the area between the lips sinks in. When this area sinks in, the flesh has begun to die. When the first element is strong and the second element dies, wood overcomes earth.</p>
<p>(Note: The energy of the Foot Taiyin arises from the spleen, which contains nourishment and externally governs the muscles. Thus, when the energy of Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse fails to nourish the muscles. The spleen opens to the mouth and governs the receipt of food; therefore, the lips and tongue are the foundation of the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish, the muscles wither, and the lips sink, showing that the life force of Taiyin has been exhausted externally. When the first element is strong and the second dies, the energy of the spleen dies internally.)</p>
<p>When the energy of the Foot Shaoyin is exhausted, the bones become brittle. Shaoyin corresponds to the winter pulse, which flows downwards and nourishes the bone marrow. Thus, if the bones are not nourished, the flesh cannot adhere.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>If bones and flesh do not support each other, then the flesh becomes soft, and when the flesh is soft, the teeth grow long and become dirty. When the hair lacks luster, it indicates that the bones have already perished. When the earth is firm, it dominates water. </p>
<p>(Note: The foot’s lesser yin energy governs the bones; thus, when energy is severed, the bones wither. The winter pulse refers to the circulation of energy in the internal organs, which is externally moistening the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. The essence of bones originates from the bones, as flesh fundamentally comes from bones. Therefore, if bones are not nourished, the flesh cannot adhere to the bones, and the relationship between bones and flesh is estranged. If bones and flesh do not support each other, the energy of the bones is expelled, leading to long and dirty teeth. The kidneys govern the storage of essence and the transformation of blood. Hair is a surplus of blood; when hair lacks luster, it indicates that the vital essence of the kidneys has depleted, leading to the death of the bones.)</p>
<p>When the energy of the foot&#39;s jueyin is severed, the tendons are also severed. The jueyin refers to the liver system, which is associated with the tendons.)<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The tendons are concentrated in the genital organs and connected at the root of the tongue. Therefore, if the pulse does not thrive, the tendons become tense; when the tendons are tense, they pull the tongue and the testes. Consequently, if the lips turn blue, the tongue curls, and the testes shrink, it indicates that the tendons are the first to perish. When metal (Geng and Xin) are extinguished, metal overcomes wood. </p>
<p>(Note: The qi of the Jueyin primarily governs the tendons, thus when the qi ceases, the tendons also cease. The Jueyin corresponds to the liver, where the liver is associated with the tendons, meaning that the qi of the Jueyin connects with the liver channel, and the qi of the liver connects with the tendons. The concentration at the genital organs indicates a meeting point of the tendon qi. As the tendons gather in the genital organs and link at the root of the tongue, when the pulse does not thrive in the tendons, they become tense, leading to the curling of the tongue and the shrinking of the testes. When the Jueyin qi is cut off, the tendons perish first. When metal is extinguished, it indicates that wood has been defeated, resulting in the cessation of the liver&#39;s wood qi.) </p>
<p>When the five yin qi are all extinguished, the eyes turn and move.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The gaze of the eye directs the will, and when the will is lost, it is as if one is half dead for a day. </p>
<p>[Note: The heart is connected above through the gaze; when the gaze shifts, the heart&#39;s energy approaches its end. The essence of fire is spirit, and the essence of water is will. Spirit arises from essence, and fire arises from water; thus when the will fails, the spirit is the first to perish. That is to say, when one is born, both come to life simultaneously, and when one dies, they both die together. Heaven generates water, while Earth generates fire. The phrase &quot;half a day&quot; refers to the interplay of yin and yang, water and fire, within the two days leading to the beginning of heaven and earth.]</p>
<p>When the six yang energies are depleted, yin and yang separate. When they separate, the pores open, and sweat emerges; hence, if it is foreseen that one will die at dawn, they will die by evening, and if it is foreseen that one will die at evening, they will die by dawn. </p>
<p>[Note: The energy of the three yang is rooted in yin but emerges in yang. Therefore, when the six yang energies are on the brink of depletion, yin and yang will indeed part ways.]<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>When leaving, the yang energy escapes outward, the pores open and release fluid, and sweat ultimately emerges, leading to the end of the yang energy. The three yang are a response to the energy of heaven, which is why divination in the morning predicts death at night, and divination at night predicts death in the morning; it cannot complete a full cycle of heavenly movement.</p>
<p>When diagnosing the channels and pulses, if the pulse color is blue, it indicates coldness and pain; if red, there is heat. A cold stomach will have many blue lines at the wrists. If there is heat in the stomach, the lines at the base of the thumb will be red. If the color is dark black, it signifies long-lasting stagnation. If there are red, black, and blue colors present, that indicates cold and heat energies. A short blue pulse indicates a lack of energy. For all cases of cold and heat treatment, there are usually many blood vessels involved, which must be addressed every other day, stopping only when the blood is depleted to harmonize deficiency and excess. If the pulse is blue and short, indicating severe lack of energy, draining too much will cause suffocation; if the suffocation is severe, the patient cannot speak, and they will urgently need to sit up.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>When diagnosing the vessels and pulses, a blue color indicates cold, while red indicates heat, as the blood and vital energy in the superficial vessels are manifested on the skin. If there is cold in the stomach, the pulse at the hand&#39;s fish region is more blue; if there is heat, it is red. The energy and blood in the skin vessels originate from the stomach organs and flow from the Yangming and Shaoyang channels to the skin at the wrist and up to the fish region. The vital energy comes from the three Yin and three Yang, generated by the stomach organs. If energy is severely lacking, purging may cause agitation, and the energy becomes more deficient and unable to circulate outside. Severe agitation may lead to collapse, rendering a person unable to speak, which indicates that the six energies of Yin and Yang arise from the essence of food and water in the stomach organs, rooted in the primordial water and fire. When the lesser Yin energy becomes obstructed below, it results in collapse and inability to speak, hence in cases of agitation, one should quickly sit up to stimulate the lesser Yin energy, similar to the method of walking gently while wearing heavy shoes with a large stick.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Transmission of the Master</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The organs are expressed through the shape of the body, limbs, joints, and flesh, corresponding to the size of the five organs and six bowels. Now, when the great nobles and esteemed rulers ascend the throne and inquire, who can examine this thoroughly before answering? Qi Bo replied: The form of the body and limbs serves as a covering for the organs and bowels, not something to be perceived by the face. The Yellow Emperor said: I already know how the qi of the five organs is displayed on the face, but how can one perceive it through the limbs and joints? Qi Bo said: The five organs and six bowels have the lungs as their covering; the large shoulders descend at the throat, observed externally. The Yellow Emperor said: Good! Qi Bo continued: Among the five organs and six bowels, the heart is the leader, and the chest is the pathway. (The bones of the tongue) bear an excess, allowing for the examination of (the bones at the) knee. The Yellow Emperor said: Excellent! Qi Bo added: The liver is the one that governs, facilitating external observation.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>To understand firmness and stability, one must observe the small and large aspects. The Yellow Emperor said: Good! Qi Bo replied: The spleen is the master of defense, making it welcome food, looking at the lips and tongue to discern preferences for knowing good or bad fortune. The Yellow Emperor said: Good! Qi Bo continued: The kidneys are the master of the outer functions, enabling distant hearing, observing the ears to discern their qualities. The Yellow Emperor said: Good! I wish to hear about the signs of the six bowels. Qi Bo said: The six bowels: the stomach is the sea, broad and expansive, with a large neck and an open chest, capable of containing grains. The nose extends to ascertain the condition of the large intestine. Thick lips with a long philtrum signal the small intestine. The lower eye&#39;s fruit is large, corresponding to the gallbladder, while the nostrils are external and the bladder discharges. The central nose column arises, indicating the sanjiao. This is how to observe the six bowels. With three levels up and down, if the organs are stable, that is good indeed. [Note: This refers to knowing through observation, which can be called a national talent.]<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>Human beings are born from the earth, their fate hangs in the heavens. The union of heaven and earth produces qi, and this is called humanity. The essence of heaven is the vital energy, while the essence of the earth takes form. This life of heaven is what establishes shape and defines qi, and thus understanding longevity and death must be clear on this matter. Therefore, the qi of the five organs is expressed in color, and the bodily organs respond to form. One can discern the qi of the five organs by examining the face, and one must also observe the form to understand the structure of the organs. Knowing both qi and form can be termed as divine insight.</p>
<p>The bones are related to the legs and the ribcage. The liver is the officer of the generals, hence it governs command. The spleen is the officer of transport, hence it governs defense. The kidneys open to the ears, thus they govern the external and indicate the distance of hearing. The robust nature pertains to the firmness and fragility of the five organs. Good fortune arises when the organs are secure, while misfortune follows when they are diseased. Nature reflects the upright and biased tendencies of the five organs.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>The nose is the orifice of the lungs, and the large intestine is the visceral organ related to the lungs, thus the nose is used to assess the large intestine. The mouth is the orifice of the spleen; the small intestine receives the impurities of the spleen and stomach and is linked to the stomach, hence the lips and the philtrum are used to assess the small intestine. The eyes are the orifice of the liver, so the area below the eyes assesses the gallbladder. The bladder is the visceral organ of fluids, and when qi transforms, it gets discharged. The nostrils are external; when the airflow from the nostrils exits outward, the bladder leaks, indicating a connection between the upper orifice and the lower discharge. The three burners act as the regulatory officials for the waterways. When the qi is constricted, it halts; when it is not constricted, it is lost. The central structure of the nose, where inhalation begins, indicates that the three burners are constricted; as such, when the upper qi is inhaled, the lower is constricted; when the upper qi is exhaled, the lower opens. This mutual opening and closing signifies a correspondence between the upper and lower aspects. This discussion on the forms of organs and their external and internal correspondences arises from the sensation of qi, illustrating the equality of the three realms: heaven, earth, and humanity.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on the Five Orifices and Five Emissaries</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: &quot;I have heard that there are five orifices and five emissaries to observe the five vital energies. These five vital energies correspond to the five organs and are associated with the five seasons. I wish to know how these five emissaries should be harmoniously released.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The five orifices are the means of observing the five organs.&quot; The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to understand their release so that it may become a norm.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The pulse emerges from the qi mouth, and colors can be observed in the Bright Hall. The five colors emerge in response to the five seasons, each corresponding to its organ; the vital energy flows into the organs, and thus treatment must focus on the interior.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The vital energy of the five organs is externally manifested in five colors, which connect upward to the five orifices. The five colors emerge in response to the five seasons, each corresponding to its organ. This is an inner response to the outer. Conversely, from the outer to the inner, it goes through the skin to the collaterals, then the pulse, then the channels, and finally the organs. Hence, when it is said that &#39;vital energy flows into the organs,&#39; treatment must indeed focus on the interior.]<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The color manifests on the skin; the qi of the five organs is reflected in color, which emerges from the meridians and appears on the skin. Therefore, it is said that the five meridians must be stable for the five colors to be visible. The Emperor asked, “Is the five colors solely determined by the Ming Tang?” Qi Bo replied, “The five orifices have already been distinguished; the threshold courtyard must be spacious, which establishes the Ming Tang. The Ming Tang is vast, covering many areas, with tall walls and a sturdy foundation, leading to the exterior. Only then can the five colors be regulated. It is broad and expansive, ensuring a long lifespan of a hundred years. Those who observe this will surely apply acupuncture. Such individuals possess abundant blood and qi, and their muscles are firm and solid, hence they can withstand needle treatment.”</p>
<p>(Note: This discussion on the qi of the five organs suggests a broad and solid foundation. The threshold courtyard refers to the celestial court. The Ming Tang is the hall where the ruler listens to affairs, akin to the celestial palace above and the royal palace below. “Covering many areas” refers to the space between the sides of the cheeks and the ears, akin to the protective screen of the Ming Tang. Tall walls with sturdy foundations suggest the strength of the square walls and a high, thick base. “Leading to the exterior” indicates the borderlands outside, acting as protection for the central region.)<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The soil here is broad and level, suitable for the nourishing brightness of the five colors. In this way, when heaven and earth interact, the dual energies flow smoothly, and one can expect to live a hundred years. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to know about the five organs.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The nose is the organ of the lungs, the eyes are the organ of the liver, the lips are the organ of the spleen, the tongue is the organ of the heart, and the ears are the organ of the kidneys.&quot; The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;How do we assess the organs?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;By observing the five viscera.&quot; Thus, a lung illness is indicated by wheezing and a flaring nose; a liver illness is indicated by greenish eyes; a spleen illness is indicated by yellowish lips; a heart illness is indicated by a curled tongue, shortness of tongue, and red cheeks; and a kidney illness is indicated by darkened cheeks and face.</p>
<p>(Note: The term &quot;organ&quot; refers to the function of sensing the five odors, distinguishing the five colors, receiving the five grains, discerning the five flavors, and hearing the five sounds, while the energies of the five viscera connect to the five orifices, each of which has its specific function. The five senses correspond to the five viscera; by observing the colors of the five senses, one can understand the diseases of the five viscera.)<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Where do the five pulses emerge, and how are the five colors perceived? What is the nature of their constant state when they are weak?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the five senses do not discern, and the hall of the senses does not open, the brightness of the hall is diminished. Obstructions prevent visibility, and walls obstruct it. The base of the walls is lacking, with corners drooping outward. Even in such normal weakness, how much more when illness strikes!&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: This refers to a foundation that is thin; its normal state is indeed weak. People rely on the qi of heaven and earth for life, and only when it is abundant, profound, and bright can they endure long.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;When the five colors appear in the bright hall, are they used to observe the qi of the five organs? Is there a form to the arrangement of high and low on the left and right?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;The five organs are positioned within; each has its own place in sequence, and the left and right, as well as up and down, correspond to their measurements.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The &#39;bright hall&#39; refers to the nose. The five organs are sequentially arranged in the center, while the six bowels flank them on either side. It indicates that the five colors appear in the bright hall, and the qi of the organs and bowels each has its corresponding position.]<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Fat and Thin Reversal</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to understand the numbers corresponding to a person&#39;s whiteness and blackness, fatness and thinness, shortness and length.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;In terms of age, a robust constitution with ample blood and vitality is indicated. The skin is firm, but, influenced by pathogenic factors, when pricked deeply, it retains the needle; this is a plump person. Those with broad shoulders and armpits, thin necks, thick black skin, and lips that are moist and thick, have black and turbid blood, and sluggish qi. Such individuals tend to be greedy in their gains and losses. When pricked deeply, it retains the needle and increases the count.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>[Note: &quot;Broad shoulders and armpits&quot; refers to being expansive on all sides. The neck is ruled by the sun; a thin neck and thick black skin indicates a strong presence of water qi. Lips are an external indication of the spleen and the moistness represents robust earth qi. The black color corresponds to water; turbid black blood indicates heavy and muddy essence water. Sluggish qi relates to thick muscle and obstructed meridians. Excess leads to giving, while deficiency leads to greed; being greedy in gains and losses means one cannot find the middle path; to exceed is as unwise as to fall short.]</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;How should one treat a thin person?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;A thin person has thin skin, little color, and lightweight, sparse flesh, with thin lips and light speech. Their blood is clear, and their qi flows smoothly, easily released by the qi and easily depleted by blood. When pricked, it should be done shallowly and quickly.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>[Note: &quot;Thin skin and little color&quot; indicates a lack of heavenly qi.]</strong><a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>The flesh is tender yet lean and clean, with thin lips and few words, indicating a deficiency in earthly energy. Blood that is clear is like shallow water. Smooth qi signifies thin muscles and a smooth, unobstructed pathway for qi.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How does one needle an ordinary person? Qibo replied: Observe their black and white, adjusting accordingly. Those who are upright and substantial have harmonized blood and qi. To needle such a person is to not deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>[Note: The black and white refer to the colors of water and heaven. Upright and substantial relates to the qualities of the earth. This person receives the balanced energy of heaven and earth, hence their harmonized blood and qi. The norm refers to the constant numbers of heaven and earth. People resonate with the energy of heaven and earth, thus their acupuncture matches the numbers of heaven, earth, and humanity.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How does one needle a strong man&#39;s true bones? Qibo replied: When needling a strong man, the true bones are firm, the flesh is relaxed, and the joints are solidly supported. If this person is heavy, their qi will be stagnant and their blood turbid. For such a person, needle deeply and leave the needle in, maximizing its effect. If the person is vigorous, their qi is smooth and their blood clear. For this person, needle shallowly and quickly.</p>
<p>[Note: The true essence from the pre-natal stage is stored in the kidneys, which govern the bones. The heavenly essence must be complete and solid for the bones and flesh to be sufficient. A person with firm true bones and relaxed flesh has harmonious muscles and filled tissues. Solidly supported means standing firm without leaning. If a person is heavy and turbid, their qi will be stagnant and their blood turbid; if they are light and vigorous, their qi will be smooth and their blood clear. The true essence is originally a mixed energy, which becomes differentiated into light and heavy post-creation. Needle deeply and leave it to guide the qi in and out; needle shallowly and quickly to achieve the desired effect.]<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Five Transformations Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we know if a person is prone to wind and has sweat issues? Shao Yu replied: If the flesh is not firm and the pores are loose, then they are prone to wind. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we tell if the flesh is not firm? Shao Yu replied: The hamstring meat is not firm and has no distinct texture. Texture refers to the coarseness; if the texture is coarse and the skin is not tight, then the pores are loose, indicating a harmonious state. </p>
<p>[Note: This means that if the skin is not dense and the muscle texture is coarse and loose, then the wind will invade internally, leading to profuse sweating. The &quot;Wei Zhong&quot; (委中) relates to the Tai Yang part. The Tai Yang energy is dominant in the skin; if the hamstring meat is not firm and lacks distinct texture, then it indicates a coarse texture. If the texture is coarse and the skin is not dense, then the pores are loose, leading to excessive sweating.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know if a person is prone to wasting disorders? Shao Yu replied: If all five organs are soft and weak, then they tend to suffer from wasting disorders. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know the five organs are soft and weak? Shao Yu replied: Softness and weakness must have a foundation of firmness. If one is firm, they can easily become angry, and the soft ones are easily injured.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: How can one distinguish between the soft and weak and the strong and firm? Shao Yu replied: A person with thin skin and a sturdy heart has a mind that is straight and assertive. When one is strong, they tend to be easily angered; anger causes their energy to rise, accumulating in the chest, where blood and energy stagnate. This leads to a fullness in the flesh, obstructed blood vessels, eventually transforming into heat. When heat arises, it consumes the skin, leading to an affliction known as &quot;xiaozhan.&quot; This reflects a person who is aggressively strong yet has weak muscles. </p>
<p>[Note: Xiaozhan refers to a condition of heat that causes thirst and weight loss. The Classic of Pathogenic Factors states that the subtle pulses of the five organs lead to &quot;xiaozhan.&quot; The five organs are responsible for storing essence. If all five organs are soft and weak, bodily fluids are depleted, making one prone to illness like &quot;xiaozhan.&quot; The physical body is a manifestation of the five organs. When one has thin skin and weak muscles, it indicates that all five organs are indeed soft and weak.]<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The soft and weak must have strength, referring to a frail physique but a strong nature. Therefore, a person with thin skin yet firm and deep-set eyes has a vital force that is vigorous and upright; their heart is strong, and strength often breeds anger. Anger causes the vital energy to rise and blood to accumulate in the chest. When the vital energy remains reversed, it causes coldness in the muscles; when blood accumulates, it obstructs the flow in the veins. When blood and energy stagnate, they turn into heat, and this heat causes the skin to deteriorate, resulting in consumption. This describes a person who is excessively strong yet has weak muscles. Indeed, weak muscles lead to soft organs, and excessive strength causes much anger and rising energy. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can one discern whether a person is prone to cold or heat? Shao Yu answered: Those with thin bones and weak flesh are prone to cold and heat. The Yellow Emperor asked: How do you assess the size of bones, the firmness or fragility of flesh, and the differences in color? Shao Yu answered: The cheekbone is the foundation of the bones.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>If the cheekbones are large, then the bones are large; if the cheekbones are small, then the bones are small. If the skin is thin, the flesh lacks substance, the arms appear weak and delicate, and the color of the complexion is unhealthy and distinct from that of the sky, this is an indication. Those with thin arms have insufficient marrow, hence they are prone to ailments of cold and heat. </p>
<p>(Note: The kidneys govern the bones, and the cheekbones serve as an external indicator of the kidneys. Thus, if the cheekbones are prominent, the bones throughout the body are also large; if they are small, it indicates that the bones are small. The ‘lack of substance’ refers to the fatty tissue of the flesh. Weak and delicate means soft and fragile. Thin arms indicate that the fleshy parts of the thighs and upper arms are not ample. The complexion of the earth signifies that it is not in harmony with the heavenly complexion, which indicates turbid and low energy. The marrow is the essence of the bones; if the bones are small, then the marrow is insufficient. Externally, the skin represents yang, while the muscles and bones represent yin. Small bones and thin skin indicate a deficiency in both yin and yang. A deficiency in yang leads to coldness, while a deficiency in yin leads to heat; thus, those with small bones and thin skin are prone to ailments of cold and heat.)</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can one observe those prone to bi syndromes? Shao Yu replied: Those with coarse texture and insufficiently firm flesh are prone to bi syndromes. The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a differentiation in the severity of bi syndromes? Shao Yu replied: To know the severity, one must observe the respective body areas.</p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;texture&quot; refers to the muscular structure; if it is coarse and not dense, then pathogens will linger and cause bi. The skin, pulse, muscles, and bones represent distinct areas related to the five organs.)<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The Treatise on Bi says: Wind, cold, and dampness combine to form Bi. If one encounters this in winter, it is called bone Bi; in spring, it is called muscle Bi; in summer, it is called meridian Bi; in the depths of yin, it is called flesh Bi; and in autumn, it is called skin Bi. Therefore, by observing the different parts, one can determine the severity of Bi. Generally, Bi of the heart and lungs is high, while Bi of the liver, kidneys, and spleen is low.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can one discern the accumulation of disorders within the intestines? Shao Yu replied: When the skin is thin and lacks moisture, and the flesh is weak and unable to retain essence, this causes discomfort in the intestines and stomach. Discomfort allows evil Qi to linger and accumulate, harming the relationship between the spleen and stomach. If temperature is not regulated, and evil Qi gradually manifests, accumulation will arise as a large mass.</p>
<p>Note: When the skin is thin and Qi does not fill the body, the moisture is lacking; thus, discomfort in the intestines and stomach occurs. This arises from the combination of fluids and blood Qi, generated by the intestines and stomach. Discomfort allows evil Qi to linger and form an accumulation, which harms the spleen and stomach. If eating and drinking are not balanced, evil Qi may gradually emerge and lead to significant accumulation. The intestines are connected to the lungs and govern the skin and Qi, while the stomach is tied to the spleen and governs the flesh and fluids. Therefore, when the skin is thin and the flesh weak, it indicates that Qi is not full and the fluids cannot effectively nourish the body. Without adequate Qi and fluids, the pores are open and tend to be loose, causing evil Qi to linger and gradually accumulate in the intestines and stomach.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Main Organs Section</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is small, it is calm, and evils cannot harm it; it is easily hurt by worries. When the heart is large, worries cannot harm it, but it is easily hurt by evils. When the heart is high, it fills the lungs, making one reflective and prone to forgetfulness, and it is difficult to articulate; when the heart is low, it is outside the organs, easily harmed by cold, and prone to fear in speech. When the heart is firm, the organs are stable and secure; when the heart is fragile, it tends to suffer from illnesses, easily weakening in heat. When the heart is upright, harmony and benefits are hard to harm; when the heart is biased or tilted, it lacks consistency in action, showing no restraint or control. </p>
<p>(Note: When the heart is small, the spirit is contained, thus it cannot be harmed; it is easily hurt by worries. When the heart is large, the spirit is vigorous, so worries cannot harm it, but the spirit is loose externally, making it susceptible to evils. The lungs are the cover of the heart; hence when the heart is high, it fills the lungs.)<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>In the heart resides verbal expression, while the lungs govern sound. When the heart and lungs are full, their passages are blocked, leading to feelings of heaviness and forgetfulness, making it difficult to articulate. The texts say: the heart is associated with the surface. Therefore, when the heart is weak, the organs outside become easily injured by cold, and fear manifests in speech. When the heart is strong, the organs are stable and secure; when the heart is weak, it tends to suffer from depletion and heat. This is because the five organs are responsible for storing essence. When the five organs are weak, the bodily fluids are thin, leading to deficiencies in nourishment.</p>
<p>When the heart is correct, spirit and vitality are harmonious and robust, making it hard for illness to inflict harm. When the heart is biased or unsteady, one lacks control and fails to maintain focus. A small lung results in less fluid intake, avoiding coughing or wheezing; a large lung leads to excessive drinking, resulting in chest and throat congestion and adverse energy. When the lung is elevated, breathing difficulty and coughing may arise; when it is situated lower, it can cause pressure on the lungs, leading to pain below the ribs. When the lung is robust, it is immune to coughing difficulties; when it is fragile, it is susceptible to illness and injury. A properly aligned lung fosters balance and resistances to harm; a tilted lung results in pain in the chest.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The lungs govern the regulation of water pathways; therefore, in small amounts, one should drink less, and in large amounts, one should drink more. The lungs are situated in the chest and open to the throat to manage respiration; hence, when the condition is mild, there is no illness like wheezing or coughing, but when it is severe, it can lead to chest and throat obstructions. The lungs are responsible for Qi; thus, when the position is high, the breath rises to the shoulders, causing coughing. The &quot;fen&quot; refers to the entrance of the stomach, located above the stomach&#39;s opening. The lungs are positioned below this entrance, and when the stomach compresses the lungs, it can obstruct the flow of blood vessels, leading to pain beneath the ribs. This area corresponds to the points in the lung meridian, namely &quot;Yunmen&quot; and &quot;Zhongfu.&quot; When the lungs are firm, the Qi does not rebel and cause coughing; when the lungs are fragile, one suffers from illnesses like consumption and is more prone to lung injury. The lungs store Qi, providing a residence for the soul; when the lungs are in good condition, the spirit and mind are harmonious, and external pathogens cannot harm. However, when the lungs are unbalanced, one experiences pain in the chest.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>When the liver is small, the organs are stable, and there is no pain in the hypochondria; when the liver is large, it presses against the stomach and the throat, leading to discomfort in the diaphragm and pain in the hypochondria. When the liver is high, it affects the upper abdominal tension, resulting in shortness of breath; when the liver is low, it pressures the stomach, causing emptiness below the hypochondria, making one susceptible to external pathogens. A strong liver stabilizes the organs and is hard to harm; a fragile liver is prone to illness and easily injured. A properly aligned liver ensures harmony and is less likely to be harmed; a tilted liver, however, causes pain in the hypochondria. </p>
<p>(Note: The liver is located under the ribs; when small, the organs are stable, and there is no hypochondrial pain. The liver is on the left side of the stomach, thus when enlarged, it presses against the stomach, causing pressure on the throat as well. The liver is below the diaphragm, hence when large it creates discomfort in the diaphragm, also leading to hypochondrial pain. The liver channel connects the diaphragm and lung, so when high, it affects upper abdominal tension, resulting in difficulty breathing. The liver is next to the stomach, therefore when low, it presses against the stomach, causing emptiness beneath the hypochondria, which can easily attract pathogens, as the hypochondria is a crucial point for the entry and exit of external influences.)<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>If the liver is strong, the organs are stable and hard to injure; if the liver is weak, it is prone to illness and easily harmed. The liver stores blood, which houses the soul; when in balance, the spirit and mind are harmonious and beneficial; when unbalanced, it leads to side pain. </p>
<p>A small spleen indicates stability of the organs and resistance to evil influences; a large spleen causes suffering and pain, making it difficult to move swiftly. When the spleen is high, it leads to pain in the side; when low, it affects the large intestine, and when this occurs, the organs suffer from harmful influences. A strong spleen ensures stability and resilience; a weak spleen is more likely to fall ill. A balanced spleen is harmonious and difficult to harm; a tilted spleen tends to fullness and distension.</p>
<p>(Note: The spleen is considered central and influential, thus a small size indicates stability and resistance to evils. The spleen is located in the abdomen near the rib cage, which explains why a large size causes discomfort and pain.)<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>The spleen governs the four limbs, hence cannot move swiftly. The lateral aspect is located above the lunar lesser, so when elevated, the lunar lesser draws on the lateral side, causing pain; when lowered, it burdens the large intestine, leading to suffering from external pathogens, as the organs become deficient in their fundamental positions. When the spleen is strong, the organs are secure and hard to harm; when the spleen is weak, it is susceptible to illnesses like edema and can be easily injured. The spleen houses intention; when intention abandons nourishment, if it is upright and proper, the spirit and mind are harmonious and beneficial; if it is skewed, it tends to fullness and distention.</p>
<p>A small kidney leads to the organs being secure and hard to harm; a large kidney tends to cause lumbar pain, making it difficult to flex or extend, and is easily harmed by pathogens. A high kidney causes back pain and makes it difficult to bend or stretch; a low kidney causes pain in the lower back and buttocks, leading to a type of hernia. A strong kidney does not suffer from back pain; a weak one easily gets diseases like edema. An upright kidney is harmonious and difficult to harm; a slanted kidney leads to back and buttock pain.</p>
<p>Annotations: The organs refer to storage. Therefore, a small organ is secure and hard to harm; a large one tends to cause lumbar pain, as the lower back is associated with the kidneys. The lumbar spine is a major joint in the body, hence pain in the lower back, back pain, and pain in the buttocks makes bending and stretching difficult. The kidneys are situated between the lower back and spine, causing various pains. The fox hernia varies in size and shifts from time to time. The fox symbolizes a yin creature, adept at transformation and concealment. The testicles ascend and descend, resembling the unpredictable movement of a fox; this is the hernia of the kidneys. A strong kidney does not suffer from back pain, while a weak one easily falls prey to diseases like edema. The kidneys store essence, and essence contains intention; if the organ body is upright and proper, the spirit and mind are harmonious and safe from injury; if it is askew, it leads to pain in the lower back and buttocks.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Red small lines signify a small heart; coarse lines indicate a large heart. Those without prominent bones have lofty hearts; those with short and small bones hold their hearts low. Those with long bones have steadfast hearts, while those with weak and thin bones possess brittle hearts. Those whose bones drop straight without elevation have upright hearts; those whose bones lean to one side have biased hearts.</p>
<p>Note: Small lines refer to fine textures in the skin; coarse lines indicate roughness in the flesh. Large flesh (fat) arises from the five organs. Thus, by examining the fineness or coarseness of the flesh, one can determine the size of the organs. Bones refer to the covering bone beneath the chest. Flesh originates from the essence and fluids produced by the organs. The reservoir refers to the fat and marrow of the organs. The essence and fluids stored in the five organs overflow into the reservoir, nourishing the flesh. Therefore, when the five organs are ill, the flesh tends to sag, breaking the outer layer of flesh.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>White, small shoulders indicate a small lung, while rough shoulders indicate a large lung; broad shoulders with concave chest indicate a high lung, while shoulders that extend to the ribs suggest a lower lung; thick shoulders and back indicate a strong lung, while thin shoulders and back indicate a fragile lung; a thick back indicates a proper lung position, while a loose ribcage indicates a tilted lung. </p>
<p>[Note: The lung is located within the area of the shoulders and above the ribs, thus by observing the shoulders and back, one can discern the high, low, strong, fragile, proper, or tilted condition of the lung.] </p>
<p>Blue, small shoulders indicate a small liver, while rough shoulders indicate a large liver; a broad chest with a concave back indicates a high liver, while a chest that meets the ribs suggests a lower liver; a well-proportioned chest and ribs indicate a strong liver, while weak rib bones suggest a fragile liver; a harmonious chest and abdomen indicate a proper liver position, while a tilted rib cage indicates a tilted liver. </p>
<p>[Note: The ribs refer to the flat bones at the junction of the chest and ribs.]<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The diaphragm is located in the chest, connecting in front to the xiphoid process, laterally to the flanks, and posteriorly to the eleven vertebrae of the spine. The liver lies beneath the diaphragm; thus, when the chest appears broad and the waist slim, the liver is high; when the chest and the waist align, the liver is low. The term &quot;waist&quot; refers to the hidden storage of bones. The liver meridian descends along the chapter gate in the abdomen and ascends along the chest&#39;s gate. The internal condition of the liver, when it enters the diaphragm, results in a well-proportioned chest and abdomen; when the flanks&#39; bones are raised, the liver tilts to one side.</p>
<p>The complexion: a yellow, fine texture indicates a small spleen, while a coarse texture indicates an enlarged spleen. When the lips are everted, the spleen is high; if they are vertical below, the spleen is low. Firm lips indicate a strong spleen, while large but soft lips suggest a brittle spleen. Lips that are balanced vertically indicate a healthy spleen, while lips that are raised on one side indicate a spleen tilted to one side. </p>
<p>(Note: Lips serve as indicators for the condition of the spleen, hence observing the lips helps to understand the health of the spleen.)<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>The small black ear indicates a small kidney, while a coarse ear indicates a large kidney; a high ear signifies a high kidney, and an ear that sinks behind signifies a lower kidney. A firm ear indicates a strong kidney, while a thin and weak ear indicates a fragile kidney. An ear that is well-formed and positioned forward suggests a proper kidney, while an ear that is tilted high suggests a skewed kidney. All these variations indicate that if one maintains stability, there will be health; if one reduces or weakens, there will be illness.</p>
<p>(Note: The ear is a reflection of the kidney, thus examining the condition of the ear helps to understand the status of the kidneys. In all these changes, if one maintains their spirit and will, they will be healthy; if weakened, illness will follow.)</p>
<p>The five organs and six bowels are the dwelling places of illness. When all five organs are small, there are fewer ailments, but when they are in pain, there is great worry and distress. If all five organs are large, they are slow in matters and are difficult to provoke into worry. All five organs being high suggests a tendency to elevate oneself; all five being low suggests a tendency to be subordinate. If all five organs are firm, there is no illness; if all five are fragile, illness is inevitable.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>When the five internal organs are all aligned, it harmonizes and wins the hearts of people. When the five internal organs are all misaligned, it breeds evil intentions and tendencies to steal, making one unfit for fairness, leading to repetitive speech.</p>
<p>(Note: The five internal organs are responsible for storing spirit, blood, energy, soul, will, and intention. When small, blood and energy are stored well, leading to fewer ailments. When small, the mind is timid, resulting in great worry and distress. When the five organs are robust, the spirit is abundant, allowing for a relaxed approach, making it difficult to cause worry. When the five organs are elevated, one tends to aim high; when they are low, one tends to look down on others. These states are influenced by one&#39;s physical form, aligning feelings and intentions accordingly. Harmonizing within manifests outwardly, thus winning the hearts of people. A thief, driven by greed, cannot be considered a person of integrity with repetitive and manipulative speech.)</p>
<p>The lung corresponds to the large intestine, which responds through the skin. The heart corresponds to the small intestine, which is linked to the pulses. The liver corresponds to the gallbladder, which is connected to the muscles. The spleen corresponds to the stomach, which relates to the flesh.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The kidneys connect with the triple burner and the bladder; the triple burner and the bladder correspond to the skin and hair. </p>
<p>(Note: The five viscera are considered Yin and the six bowels are Yang; they are complementary. The five viscera internally correspond with the six bowels, while the six bowels externally manifest in form, with Yin being internal and Yang external. Thus, by examining the skin, vessels, flesh, tendons, and bones, one can discern the thickness and length of the six bowels. The kidneys are linked to both the triple burner and the bladder.) </p>
<p>The lungs correspond to the skin. When the skin is thick, the large intestine is thick; when the skin is thin, the large intestine is thin. If the skin is loose and the abdomen is large, the large intestine is also large and long; if the skin is tense, the large intestine is tense and short. If the skin is smooth, the large intestine is straight; if the skin and flesh do not separate, the large intestine is blocked.</p>
<p>(Note: The five viscera internally correspond with the six bowels, while externally manifesting in skin, vessels, flesh, tendons, and bones. Hence, the lungs correspond to the skin, where thicker skin indicates a thicker large intestine and thinner skin indicates a thinner large intestine.)<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>The shapes and energies of the organs interact through exchanges between the external and internal. The heart corresponds to the pulse. Thick skin indicates a thick pulse, which means the small intestine is also thick; thin skin means a thin pulse, indicating a thin small intestine. Loose skin results in a relaxed pulse, leading to a larger and longer small intestine; thin skin with a small and rapid pulse indicates a small and short small intestine. All the Yang meridians that are often twisted indicate a condition of the small intestine.</p>
<p>In the section on pathological energies of the organs, it states: A rapid pulse correlates with tense skin, while a slow pulse corresponds with relaxed skin. This is how the skin and pulse correspond to each other.</p>
<p>The spleen corresponds to the flesh. Firm and large flesh indicates a thick stomach, while slender flesh indicates a thin stomach. Flesh that is small and slender means the stomach is not firm; if the flesh does not match the body, the stomach is deficient, leading to blockage in the epigastric region. If the flesh is not firm, the stomach is relaxed; if the flesh has no small lumps, the stomach is tense.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>Excessive meat consumption leads to a condition called &quot;stomach obstruction.&quot; Stomach obstruction results in difficulties with the upper abdomen. </p>
<p>(Note: The stomach has upper, middle, and lower parts; thus, obstruction in the lower part affects the lower abdomen, while obstruction in the upper part affects the upper abdomen.)</p>
<p>The liver corresponds to the nails. If the nails are thick and yellow, it indicates a thick gallbladder; if they are thin and red, it indicates a thin gallbladder. If the nails are hard and blue, it indicates a rapid gallbladder; if they are soft and red, it indicates a sluggish gallbladder. If the nails are straight and white with no issues, it indicates a healthy gallbladder; if they are discolored, black, and veiny, it indicates gallbladder obstruction. </p>
<p>(Note: The nails are a residual effect of the tendons; thus, the liver corresponds to the nails. By observing the condition of the nails, one can discern the thickness and quickness of the gallbladder. All organs are influenced by the gallbladder; hence, they embody the colors associated with the five elements of the five internal organs.)</p>
<p>The kidneys correspond to the bones. If the bone&#39;s structure is dense and has thick skin, it indicates a strong bladder; if it is coarse and has thin skin, it indicates a weak bladder.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The state of the skin and pores can be classified based on the conditions of the Sanjiao and Bladder: if the skin is relaxed and the pores are open, this corresponds to a relaxed state of the Sanjiao and Bladder; if the skin is tense and the pores are closed, this indicates a tense state of the Sanjiao and Bladder. If the hairs are robust and beautiful, this indicates a straight state of the Sanjiao and Bladder, while sparse hairs indicate a condition of blockage in the Sanjiao and Bladder.</p>
<p>(The essence of the Yang Qi governs the skin and fur, and the Qi of the Sanjiao connects with the pores, which is why by observing the thickness and thinness of the skin and pores, one can trace back to the conditions of the Sanjiao and Bladder. Additionally, body fluids, following the Qi of the Sanjiao, warm the muscles and fill the skin. The Sanjiao is aligned with the lesser Yang energy. The classic text states: &quot;Moisten the skin, nourish the body, and enrich the fur; this is referred to as Qi.&quot; Therefore, both the skin and fur correspond to the Sanjiao and Bladder.)</p>
<p>By observing the external expressions, one can understand the internal organs, thus ascertaining what illness is present.</p>
<p>(The six Fu are interconnected with the five Zang, and their external expressions correspond to the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. Hence, by viewing these external expressions, one can understand the internal organs, and this reveals what ailments exist. Indeed, the thickness, relaxation, tension, and size of the six Fu contribute to illnesses in a manner parallel to the five Zang.)<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>The Five Colors Text</strong></p>

The Yellow Emperor replied, &quot;The Bright Hall is the nose, the threshold is between the eyebrows, the courtyard is the face, the rich part is the sides of the cheeks, and the covering part is the ears. In between, it should be square and large, and if one steps back by ten paces, it can be seen from outside; thus, with this, one will surely live to be a hundred years old.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The five organs arise from the five elements of the earth. The five elements of the earth present the five colors of the heavens, along with the six energies of the three yin and three yang, thus the colors are evident in the Bright Hall. The pulse emerges from the energy orifice, and the energies of the five organs manifest in color and correspond to the pulse. Hence it is said that the five energies are the messengers of the five organs and the assistants of the five seasons. The energy orifice is the left person receiving the pulse at the right&#39;s inch orifice, which is how one gauges the energies of the three yin and three yang. The three yin and three yang are the energies of the five organs and six hollow organs.] </p>
<p>The Thunder Prince then asked, &quot;How is the distinction of the five organs?&quot; The Yellow Emperor replied, &quot;The Bright Hall&#39;s bones rise high and are even and straight. The five organs are arranged in the center, while the six hollow organs are positioned on both sides.&quot;<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>The head is above in the hall of the threshold, while the royal palace is at the lower extreme. The five organs are settled within the chest; the true color is manifested, while the sickness color does not appear, and the hall of brightness is nourished with clarity. How can the five senses be without distinction?</p>
<p>(Note: The five senses refer to the five organs that correspond externally. The hall of brightness refers to the nose; the bridge of the nose must be high and straight. The five organs are arranged in the center: the lung is in the center of the threshold hall, the heart is below that, the liver is directly below, the spleen is further down, while the organs are considered yin and are thus positioned centrally. The six hollow organs flank the sides: the gallbladder is to the left of the liver, the stomach is above, the large intestine is central, the small intestine is above the face, and the bladder is below the face. The hollow organs are considered yang and are thus positioned on the sides. The kidneys are the water organs, positioned adjacent to the large intestine and located outside the concealment, correspond to the earth, which is central and provides for the outer sea. The head is above in the hall of the threshold, while the royal palace is at the lower extreme; this corresponds to Heaven, the hall above, and the royal palace below, encompassing the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.)<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The gate of the court corresponds to the lungs, which govern the sky and reside above. The lowest point corresponds to the spleen, which governs the earth and is located below. The royal palace corresponds to the heart, which is the ruler and resides in the center. The five organs dwell safely within the chest, and their true colors are manifested externally; how could the five senses not discern them?</p>
<p>The thunder deity asked: &quot;Can those that cannot be discerned be heard?&quot; The Yellow Emperor replied: &quot;The appearance of the five colors each emerges from its respective organ; those whose corresponding bones are sunken will inevitably suffer from illness. Those whose color lineage is maintained, even if severely ill, shall not die.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Those that cannot be discerned&quot; refers to the inability to identify true colors while only distinguishing the colors of illness. The appearance of the five colors, each emerging from its respective organ, suggests that the colors of the organ&#39;s illnesses are visible in their associated locations. The discussion on heat states: &#39;The color indicates illness at the prominence of the cheekbone.&#39; &#39;Those with sunken bones&#39; indicates that the color of the organ is obscured and appears sunken within the bones, which means that illness has already manifested. Illness originating from within expresses itself outwardly; if the color is obscured and seen within the bones, the illness has already developed.]<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>Heirs inherit their mother&#39;s essence; for example, if the heart is yellow, the liver is red, the lungs are black, and the kidneys are green, this means the child&#39;s essence inherits from the mother&#39;s condition. Even in severe illness, they do not die, as the child can help alleviate the mother&#39;s illness. Lei Gong asked: What about the colors of the organs? Huang Di replied: Blue and black indicate pain, yellow and red indicate heat, and white indicates cold. These are the five colors associated with the five organs. </p>
<p>(Note: Blue and black represent the colors of wind and cold, hence signifying pain; yellow and red represent the colors of fire and earth, hence indicating heat; while white denotes the essence of clarity and purity, therefore associated with cold. Thus, the colors signify external causes of illness.) </p>
<p>Lei Gong then asked: How can one relate illness to color? Huang Di said: If the color is coarse and bright, it signifies severity, while deep and dull shades imply greater severity. If the color ascends, the illness worsens; if it descends and diffuses like clouds, the illness is easing. Each of the five organs has both external and internal aspects. Colors moving from the outside to the inside indicate the illness shifts from external to internal, while colors moving from inside to outside indicate the illness is moving outward. Illness that arises internally should be treated first through its yin aspect, followed by its yang aspect; neglecting this order exacerbates the condition.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>If the illness arises from Yang, first treat the exterior, then treat the interior; otherwise, the condition will worsen. </p>
<p>(Note: The essence is that Yang energy expresses outwardly while Yin remains inward. When Yin and Yang intersect, the severity of the illness increases. The complexion reflects the energies of the five organs and elements, manifesting externally from internal conditions. A rising color indicates that the illness is growing stronger. Just as earthly energies rise to form clouds, receiving heavenly energies allows them to disperse; hence, one&#39;s condition can improve.</p>
<p>The organs are divided into sections: the five organs are located centrally (internally), while the six bowels are on either side (externally). When color travels from the exterior to the interior, it signifies an external illness affecting the internal. Conversely, when color moves from the interior to the exterior, it indicates an internal illness manifesting outwardly. The bowels represent Yang and govern the exterior, while the organs represent Yin and govern the interior. Therefore, if the illness originates internally, treat Yin first before Yang; if it originates externally, treat Yang first before Yin; otherwise, the condition will worsen.)<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The Thunder Lord said: &quot;I have heard that wind is the beginning of a hundred ailments, and that reversal is the onset of cold and dampness. How should these be distinguished?&quot; The Yellow Emperor replied: &quot;The constant observation is at the tower; the wind is represented by a thin sheen, and the dampness manifests as turbid. On the ground, it signifies reversal; this is its nature. Each illness is expressed through its color.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The ground refers to the earth platform. Wind is hence linked to meteorological forces, so it is regularly observed in the courtyard. Cold and dampness derive from the energy of the earth, thus they are observed in the earth&#39;s domain. Wind is a Yang evil, hence its color is that of a thin sheen. Cold and dampness are Yin evils, so their color is turbid. This indicates that the evils of wind, cold, and dampness can simultaneously invade the channels and enter the organs, leading to sudden death that cannot be saved. Therefore, the invasion of evil wind occurs as swiftly as wind and rain, becoming the source of a hundred illnesses. Hence, a skilled healer prioritizes treating the skin and hair, followed by the muscles and skin, then the tendons and vessels, and finally the organs. Treating the organs is like being half-dead and half-alive. Thus, one must clarify the divisions, examine both external and internal conditions, and utilize Yin harmonization with Yang, and vice versa, ensuring that evils do not enter the organs and result in irreparable harm. This is what is called a master craftsman, and their effectiveness is unparalleled.)<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>The Thunder Prince said: If a person dies suddenly without illness, how can we know it? The Yellow Emperor replied: When the great qi enters the organs and vessels, one may die suddenly without illness. The Thunder Prince asked: How can we know when someone who has a minor illness recovers but still dies suddenly? The Yellow Emperor said: If red color appears on both cheeks, as large as a thumb, then even if the minor illness seems to have recovered, death is certain. If black color appears on the forehead, as large as a thumb, that death will certainly occur without illness.</p>
<p>[Note: The great qi entering the organs refers to external evils invading the organs, hence one dies suddenly without illness. &quot;Not ill&quot; indicates there are no external physical symptoms. When someone recovers from a minor illness but still dies suddenly, the internal conditions of the organs accumulate. Red color appearing on both cheeks and black color appearing on the forehead refers to the kidneys affecting the heart, where the heart becomes ill and the kidneys respond in this way. Red relates to the color of fire, while black corresponds to the color of water. Recovery from a minor illness means water nourishes the fire. Sudden death indicates that water has overwhelmed and extinguished the fire. The essence of the five elemental energies is that when they are balanced, life flows; when one is overpowered, it leads to destruction.]<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>Regarding illnesses related to qi, their color is scattered and not concentrated; those occupying the pulse, however, have a concentrated color that does not scatter. The size of a thumb indicates the concentration of blood vessels. The kidney pulse connects to the chest and links to the heart; when red color appears on both cheeks, it signifies the kidney&#39;s influence over the heart and the outward flow of heart fire. When black color appears on the courtyard, it means the kidney&#39;s influence on the heart has caused preemptive illness in the heart, and the kidney reacts correspondingly, thus displaying this color—both in appearance and size resembling a thumb. </p>
<p>The organs are storage areas, and the appearance of the five colors on the face reflects the qi of the five organs; the colors that manifest externally signify the outpouring of the organs&#39; true essence. </p>
<p>Lei Gong then bowed again and said: &quot;Well said! Is there a time limit for death?&quot; The Yellow Emperor replied: &quot;Observe the colors to discern the timing.&quot; Lei Gong responded: &quot;Excellent! I wish to learn this thoroughly.&quot; The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;The courtyard indicates the face; the upper threshold represents the throat; the middle threshold corresponds to the lungs; the lower extremity relates to the heart; directly downward points to the liver; the left of the liver signifies the gallbladder; below it indicates the spleen; above it is the stomach; the center corresponds to the large intestine; beside the large intestine are the kidneys; directly corresponding to the kidneys is the navel; above the face of the king refers to the small intestine; below the face of the king indicates the bladder area.&quot;<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>The cheek corresponds to the shoulder, the area behind the cheek corresponds to the arm, below the arm corresponds to the hand, the area above the inner corner of the eye corresponds to the breast, the area that holds the rope upwards corresponds to the back, the area below the molars corresponds to the thigh, the center corresponds to the knee, below the knee corresponds to the shin, the area below the shin corresponds to the foot, the large division corresponds to the inner thigh, and the large bend corresponds to the kneecap. These are the parts of the five organs and six bowels, each having its own components. There are parts that utilize yin and yang, and those that combine yang and yin. When one understands the parts clearly, all actions are appropriate. The ability to discern left from right is referred to as the Great Way. Since men and women occupy different positions, it is called yin and yang.</p>
<p>[Note: Observing color to determine the time pertains to analyzing the colors of the five organs and five elements to know the time of death. For example, if red appears on both cheeks, the date of death would be ren or gui, with the time being midnight. Black appearing in the courtyard indicates a death on the date wu or ji, with the time being the hours of xu, chou, or wei. Each organ corresponds to a color of the five elements, having its own relevant part, thus one must understand these parts, utilizing yin and yang, and combining yang and yin. With harmony among yin and yang, all actions are fitting.]<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>Yang comes from the left, Yin from the right; being able to distinguish between left and right is called the great way of heaven and earth. The color of men goes from left to right, while the color of women goes from right to left. Due to the different positions of men and women, it is thus referred to as Yin and Yang.</p>
<p>When observing the features of water and land, one is called a skilled craftsman. Turbid represents the inner, while the clear represents the outer. Yellow and red signify wind, blue and black signify pain, white signifies cold, and yellow with a glossy appearance signifies pus; excessive red signifies blood. Severe pain results in contractions, while intense cold results in insensitive skin. The five colors each show their respective parts; by observing their floating and sinking, one can understand depth, and by examining their clarity and turbidity, one can gauge success and failure. By noting their dispersion and gathering, one can discern distance, and by observing colors vertically and horizontally, one can identify the location of illness. Cultivate the spirit in the heart to know the past and the present. Therefore, observing vital signs is not trivial; without understanding right and wrong, one loses sight of the new and the old. Colors that are clear but not coarse, and turbidity that is pronounced, indicate severity. If the colors are unclear and lack shine, the illness is not severe.</p>
<p>(Note: The inner and outer refer to the external causes of illness affecting the inner body. Observing the floating and sinking colors reveals the illness&#39;s external and internal aspects. Wind is associated with the Yang of heaven, thus showing yellow and red, while pain is associated with Yin stagnation, showing blue and black. White signifies cold, and yellow with a glossy appearance indicates abscess or pus.)<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>The red intensity indicates a retention of blood. Pain in the muscles and bones signifies that severe cases lead to spasms. Cold harms the skin; therefore, in severe cases, it results in insensitivity of the skin. Additionally, the influence of various evils presents itself in the five colors, each indicating different aspects. By observing the fluctuation of colors, one can discern the superficiality or depth of the disease; by examining the luster of colors, one can perceive a person&#39;s successes or failures; by analyzing the dispersal of colors, one can understand the proximity of the illness; and by observing the colors&#39; variations, one can locate the site of the disease. </p>
<p>Accumulating the spirit in the heart allows one to comprehend the past and present, ensuring that one&#39;s perception of qi is not vague, and one knows right from wrong, retaining awareness of the new and the old. If the color is bright but not coarse and appears dark and dull, the ailment is severe. If the color is not bright or lustrious but does not appear dark and dull, then the illness is less severe. The diseases caused by external factors should disperse outward rather than enter inward.</p>
<p>When the color is dispersed and appears scattered, the disease is still unaggregated and its pain is diffused. Aggregation has not yet formed. The kidneys relate to the heart; when the heart suffers, the kidneys respond in kind, reflecting these changes in color. </p>
<p>(Note: The annotation states that if the internal disease is dispersed rather than aggregated, then its colors look scattered as if still unaccumulated.)<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>If there is a congestion in the internal organs and the blood vessels are intertwined, the color of that congestion will manifest as a terminal illness. The movement is swift and fleeting, like a foal passing through a narrow gap, without lingering. Its color is dispersed; hence, the illness has not yet formed a mass. When Qi is injured and pain arises, the condition disperses in the Qi aspect, and the mass has not yet developed in the blood vessels. If the internal organ illness does not stem from the Qi aspect, such as when the kidney influences the heart, the heart will suffer first, and a reddish mass will appear on both cheeks, about the size of a thumb. The kidney will respond, and a black color will emerge from the lower abdomen, also about the size of a thumb. This is due to external evils accumulating in the internal organs, thus the colors are gathered and not dispersed.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber&quot;: if the blood and Qi enter the internal organs, it results in death; if they enter the bowels, there is recovery. This is not just one illness; it applies to all ailments. Conditions outside can be treated, but those within will lead to death.</p>
<p>For men, manifestations on the face indicate pain in the lower abdomen, with pain descending to the testicles, and a rounded form correlating to pain in the penis. Height indicates the source, while the lower part indicates the endpoint, relating to conditions of the lower regions. For women, manifestations on the face correspond to bladder conditions. Pain that is dispersed relates to distress, while pain that is concentrated indicates a mass; both the square and round forms align with their respective colors and shapes.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>It descends to the condition of indulgence, appearing as a moist and greasy substance, indicative of gluttony and impurity. The left side represents the left, and the right side represents the right; its colors are aberrant, gathering and dispersing without order, as indicated by the complexion. </p>
<p>(Note: The areas above the facial king relate to the small intestine; those below relate to the bladder. Thus, if a man’s complexion reflects the facial king, it indicates pain in the lower abdomen, while a round and straight appearance signifies pain in the genitals. External causes of illness arise from the outside to the inside, and colors flow from above to below. Therefore, the elevated is the foundation, while the lower is the first to act; the illness is related to the condition of the lower and the fox injury (nephropathy). For women, the complexion reflecting the facial king indicates conditions related to the bladder. </p>
<p>Illnesses in men and women, when scattered in the qi aspect, result in pain; when congested in the blood aspect, they become masses. The condition of the fox injury (nephropathy) is marked by tangible evidence, which may be square or round, on the left or right, reflecting their respective colors and shapes. When illness gathers internally, it manifests as color externally. A square form indicates a square color, and a round form indicates a round color. Although this illness manifests in shape without harming the organs, the gathered colors are not indicative of death. Each of the five organs and six bowels has its distinct parts.)<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>There is the external and the internal; if one can clearly understand the parts and know their external and internal states, one will be capable in all matters. The &quot;zhi&quot; refers to the lower part of the face, beneath the &quot;king of the face.&quot; The color of the king of the face descends to the &quot;zhi&quot;; when it exhibits signs of lust and turbidity, its color is moist and like grease, indicating overeating unclean food. The viscera are yang and govern the external, responsible for receiving and processing food and drink, hence one may suffer from external wind and cold or internal injury from food and drink, leading to visceral disease reflected in the color of the viscera. If the color is seen on the left, it indicates disease on the left; if on the right, it indicates disease on the right. The observed colors may be either concentrated or dispersed, all show slantingly and not upright; the gathered color of the facial area is said to resemble a finger. Blood vessels flowing and major evils entering the organs can lead to sudden death. Now, with visceral diseases associated with &quot;fox disease&quot; and similar conditions, due to influences gathering and causing diseases, one sees color concentration, which is not a sign of death within the organs. Colors involve blue, black, red, white, and yellow, each having its own distinct area. The distinct area of red is as red as the catalpa pod, located on the king of the face, not to be overlooked.<br>(Note: Blue, yellow, red, white, and black are the colors associated with the five organs and five elements.)<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>The wanderer from afar, like the small intestine’s section being in the facial region, and the facial region is indeed the wanderer of the heart. The gallbladder section is located on the left of the liver; thus, the gallbladder is the wanderer of the liver. The size of a catalpa pod indicates a meeting of blood, resembling the shape of a thumb. &quot;No day&quot; signifies that one does not survive a full day before dying. This implies that the color associated with the illnesses of the five organs appears in the primary regions, while the colors indicating death of the five organs appear in their wanderers. For instance, when the heart suffers externally from an evil influence and dies suddenly, its color appears in the facial region. If the heart suffers internally from illness and dies suddenly, its color manifests in the cheekbone. Neither of these locations is the primary section of the heart. For those in the organs, the color is directly full and not slanted; for those in the bowels, the color is slanted and not direct. This is the distinction between life and death in the organs and bowels. The color’s upward movement is sharp at the top and empty, directed upwards; the downward movement is sharp below and empty, directed downwards, and on the sides according to the pattern. Note that the color that ascends is sharp upwards, its peak is light and floats upwards. The color that descends is sharp downwards, its peak is light and floats downwards. It indicates that when illness arises from within to outside, its root is below, and its peak is above. Conversely, illness that arises from outside to inside has its root above and its peak below.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>Thus, the essence is dense while the head is light; this is the appearance of fullness at one end. If there is distortion and it is unsteady, its essence is on the left and its head moves to the right; if its essence is on the right, it moves to the left. This is similar to the method where both the upper and lower sharp heads are empty. This ailment resides in the viscera and manifests as color.</p>
<p>The five colors designate the organs: blue for the liver, red for the heart, white for the lungs, yellow for the spleen, and black for the kidneys. The liver corresponds to tendons, the heart to vessels, the lungs to skin, the spleen to flesh, and the kidneys to bones.</p>
<p>(Note: It is stated above that red emerges from the cheekbones, black from the courtyard, and red is found on the face, representing the colors of the heart and kidney. If one designates the five colors to the organs, then each of the five organs has its corresponding color. Moreover, the shoulders, arms, chest, back, knees, shins, hands, and feet all have skins, vessels, flesh, tendons, and bones that correspond to the five organs. By observing their five colors, one can ascertain the ailments within the five organs and the external correspondences. These five organs internally correspond to the five elements and externally present the five colors. If external evils of wind, cold, heat, or dampness manifest in color, these correspond to the six qi reflecting in color.) Classic Text Compilation of Medicine, Volume 90</p>

<p>Treatise on Courage<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: How do the winds of the four seasons affect patients? Shao Yu replied: Those with thin, yellow skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of spring; those with thin, white skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of summer; those with thin, green skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of autumn; and those with thin, red skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of winter. The Yellow Emperor asked: What about those with black skin? Shao Yu said: Those with black skin that is thick and the flesh firm are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons. However, if the skin is thin and the flesh not firm, and the colors are not consistent, they will fall ill due to the vacuous wind in the long summer. Those with thick skin and firm flesh will not fall ill due to the vacuous wind in the long summer. Yet, those with thick skin and firm flesh will suffer if they are heavily affected by cold; this is true both internally and externally, and they will then be ill. The Yellow Emperor said: Good! </p>
<p>[Note: Between skin and muscle lies the connection to the five organs&#39; true energy. Thus, thin skin and weak flesh signify that the organ&#39;s true energy is vacuous. If the energy of the five organs is vacuous, it cannot withstand the vacuous winds of the four seasons. The vacuous wind refers to the harmful wind of imbalance. Black is the color of water, signifying the thickness of kidney energy. Those who are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons indicate that the earth is strong throughout the seasons, while those who do not fall ill during the long summer imply that the earth governs the long summer. If there are those with thick skin and firm flesh who are harmed by the winds of the four seasons, they must be heavily affected by cold. In the ground, it is water; in the heavens, it is cold. The kidneys are the water organs, resonating with the cold energy from the heavens, thus appearing black. When those with thick skin and firm flesh fall ill, it must be due to significant exposure to cold, affecting both internally and externally—external exposure to the cold from the heavens harms the internal kidney&#39;s water energy.]<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on the Disturbance of Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one discern ailments of the skin, flesh, blood, and bones? Bo Gao replied: When the color arises between the two eyebrows, appearing moist, the ailment is in the skin. If the color of the lips is blue, yellow, red, white, or black, the ailment is in the flesh. If the complexion is moist, the ailment is in the blood and qi. If the eye color shows blue, yellow, red, white, or black, the ailment is in the tendons. If the ears are scorched and dry, covered in dust and filth, the ailment is in the bones. </p>
<p>[Note: The color reflects the condition of qi. The space between the eyebrows signifies the lung area. Since the lungs are linked to the skin, the moist color between the eyebrows indicates that the disturbance of defensive qi is in the skin. The flesh corresponds to the spleen; thus, observing the lip colors helps identify issues in the flesh. &#39;Rong&#39; refers to the essence of blood; sweat being a manifestation of blood moisture indicates issues in blood and qi. The liver governs the tendons, with the eyes being its orifice, and observing the eye colors helps identify issues in the tendons. Tendons connect to the twelve meridians of yin and yang, explaining the presence of multiple colors. The ears signify the kidney&#39;s orifice; when they are dry and soiled, it indicates that the disturbance of defensive qi is in the bones. The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones are the external manifestations of qi, with defensive qi emanating from the body and residing in their respective places.]<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>The Chapter on the Twenty-Five Types of Yin and Yang</strong></p>

They are talented, diligent, yet weak, prone to worries and troubled by affairs. They thrive in spring and summer but falter in autumn and winter, leading to illness from emotional disturbances. The feet of this type are marked by a lack of vitality.</p>
<p>The person of the large angle is compared to the left foot&#39;s lesser yang, appearing somewhat prolonged. The person of the left angle resembles the right foot&#39;s lesser yang, exhibiting a certain following nature. The person of the right angle is similar to the right foot&#39;s lesser yang, appearing to push forth. The person of the ruling angle resembles the left foot&#39;s lesser yang, showing a descending demeanor.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: Wood is the element associated with the East, its sound is connected to the angle, and its color is azure; thus, the wood form person is likened to the upper angle and resembles the celestial azure emperor. The bluish hue reflects the color of wood. The small head indicates the small apex of wood. A long face signifies the long body of wood. Broad shoulders and back suggest the rich growth of wood&#39;s branches and leaves, and the width near the shoulders. An upright body represents the straightness of wood&#39;s form. Small hands and feet indicate the slender branches and the small roots of wood. These characteristics pertain to the body itself. Being talented indicates that wood can be shaped into useful material. Weakness implies that wood can easily sway. Internal worries coupled with external troubles suggest that wood cannot remain still.]</strong><a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>Those who endure spring and summer are like trees that thrive in spring and grow in summer; those who do not endure autumn and winter suffer as trees wither and shed leaves in those seasons, thus leading to illness arising from these changes. This speaks to one’s nature alone. The foot’s Jueyin channel is governed by the Wood element, which symbolizes beauty, much like beautiful timber. The five musical notes correspond to the transformations of the five movements; the three Yang energies manage the six seasonal influences under heaven. The harmony of the five notes with the three Yang energies relates to the conjunction of the heavenly stems and earthly branches in accordance with the years’ movements.</p>
<p>The foot’s Jueyin and the foot&#39;s Shaoyang join together, aligning one Yin with the four Yangs flanking the Tai and Shao, responding to the earth positioned centrally, with heavenly energies operating above, below, and around. The term &quot;Da&quot; refers to the Tai Jiao, which represents the great horn. A person characterized by the Tai Jiao is compared to the left foot&#39;s Shaoyang, while those characterized by the Jiao are likened to the right foot&#39;s Shaoyang. When the Shaoyang is robust, as described below, the chi and blood are abundant, resulting in a long and beautiful beard. The expression of being &quot;Yiyi&quot; suggests a humble demeanor, like branches and leaves that extend downward. &quot;Tu tui&quot; implies a proactive stance, akin to branches and leaves that reach upward.</p>
<p>&quot;Ban&quot; signifies discernment, or the lesser horn. Those characterized by the left horn are compared to the right foot&#39;s Shaoyang, while those associated with the &quot;pan jiao&quot; are likened to the left foot&#39;s Shaoyang. When the lower Shaoyang is vigorous, as noted below, the chi and blood flourish, leading to long leg hair and well-developed outer ankles. &quot;Zui zui&quot; denotes a harmonious demeanor, as with the bending form of wood, while &quot;Guo guo&quot; refers to an upright stance, much like the straightness of a tree trunk.</p>

Those with a right-side constitution are also likened to the right hand associated with the sun, but they are less defined above. Those with a distinguished physique resemble the left hand associated with the sun, appearing delicate below. </p>
<p>(Note: Fire is associated with the south; its sound is represented by the term &quot;zheng,&quot; and its color is red, hence the fire-related features of a person resemble the celestial red emperor. The red hue denotes the color of fire. A broad back signifies the fiery intensity and abundance of vigor. A sharp face and small head illustrate the upward movement of fire, sharp and diminutive. The well-defined shoulders, back, thighs, and abdomen represent the beauty and radiance of fire rising. Small hands and feet indicate the lesser influence of fire. The ability to walk steadily signifies the emergence of fire from the earth. A swift heart reflects the ferocity of fire. Unsteady movement illustrates the dynamic nature of fire. Muscular shoulders and back represent the abundance of vigor. Vitality signifies the energetic disposition of fire, reflective of their body.

Those who are overly worried and see things clearly have a bright and illuminating nature like fire. Those who enjoy beauty possess the radiance of fire. Those with an urgent heart have a hasty nature like fire. Those who do not live long and die suddenly have a transient nature like fire. This is simply a discussion of their inherent qualities. </p>
<p>Those who endure spring and summer thrive during the time when wood and fire nurture each other. Those who do not withstand autumn and winter suffer because fire fears the cool and cold; thus, feelings of autumn and winter give rise to illness. The hand associated with the Lesser Yin represents the fire that governs qi, embodying the true essence, like the clear and upright spirit of fire. </p>
<p>The Lesser Yin hand relates harmoniously with the Lesser Yang hand. The essence represents the form of fire; the essence signifier is equivalent to great significance, while the essence discernment is the minor significance. The essence signifier person is comparable to the left hand of the Sun, while the right signifier person is comparable to the right hand of the Sun. Those with a vibrant, plump appearance beneath the Sun, according to the text, have abundant blood qi, which leads to a fuller beard and a rounded face. A plump appearance indicates fullness of flesh, while a vibrant appearance denotes a lively spirit. </p>
<p>The minor signifier person relates to the right hand of the Sun, while the essence discernment person relates to the left hand of the Sun. Those with a loose and relaxed appearance beneath the Sun, according to the text, also indicate abundant blood qi, leading to a full palm. A loose demeanor reflects a state of joy. The reciprocal response between the upper and lower body is described here as well. </p>

This is simply a matter of their nature. The foot Taiyin, representing moist earth, is characterized by a solid and thick quality. The foot Taiyin harmonizes with the foot Yangming. Individuals with strong Taiyin are likened to the left foot Yangming, while those with weaker Taiyin are referenced to the right foot Yangming. The above-mentioned Yangming is gentle and firm; in the context of blood and qi being strong above the foot Yangming, their beard is beautiful and long. Gentle signifies a harmonious state, which aligns with the virtue of earth. Firm refers to the steadiness of rotation, which pertains to the essence of earth. The increased palace refers to the thickening of earth and compares to the upper palace. Those with an increased palace are analogous to the left foot Yangming, while left palace individuals compare to the right foot Yangming. Below the Yangming, if their blood and qi is strong, the lower body hair is beautiful and long, reaching to the chest. The unsteady condition refers to fluctuating movements, like the unevenness of mountain roads. Steady implies a stable demeanor, as in flat earth. </p>
<p>Individuals with a golden constitution are likened to the upper Shang, resembling the White Emperor. Their physique is characterized by a round face, fair complexion, small head, narrow shoulders and back, small abdomen, and small hands and feet, with a light bone structure. They are clear-minded, quick-witted, and composed, excelling in governance. They thrive in autumn and winter but struggle in spring and summer, as spring and summer affect them and illnesses arise.

<p>(Note: In the West, the master of metal is associated with the sound &quot;shang,&quot; and its color is white, hence the form of the metal person resembles the upper shang, akin to the white emperor of Heaven. A square face represents the square nature of metal. The white color corresponds to the white nature of metal. A small head, abdomen, shoulders, and back signify the compact nature of metal, which is not grand or floating. Small hands and feet, light as bone with prominent heels, indicate that the metal body is firm and strong. A clean and pure body means the metal is cold and clean, unaffected by impurities. This is merely from the perspective of their physical form. An urgent mind that is tranquil indicates that their quality is still and sharp. Those skilled in governance possess the talent akin to that of an axe. Autumn and winter are the seasons when metal and water nurture one another. They are not suited to spring and summer, as they are constrained by wood and fire, which is why they become ill during these seasons. This is from the perspective of their nature. The Taiyin hand signifies the dry metal that governs qi, heavy and substantial, reflecting the weight of metal itself. The Taiyin hand and the Yangming hand complement each other. The commerce of the right hand is compared to the left hand of Yangming, while the commerce of the left hand is compared to the right hand of Yangming, where above Yangming, a vigorous blood qi makes whiskers beautiful.

<p>The water-shaped person is compared to an upper feather, resembling the Black Emperor. This person has a dark complexion, an uneven face, a large head, prominent jawline, small shoulders, a large belly, and when moving their limbs, their body sways, with a long lower back. They lack respect and are adept at deceiving others, leading to their downfall. They thrive in autumn and winter but cannot withstand spring and summer, as these seasons provoke illness. Their feet exhibit the dampness of the lesser Yin. The person shaped like great feathers is compared to the right foot of the sun, with brightness above the cheeks.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>The person of Shao Yu is compared to the left foot of the sun, which is slow and unhurried under the sun.

<p>(Note: In the northern regions, water is governed; its sound is &quot;yu&quot; and its color is black, hence those resembling water are compared to this upper &quot;yu,&quot; resembling the dark emperor of the heavens. The black color pertains to the nature of water. An uneven face suggests rippling water surfaces. A large head signifies a broad and flat water surface. The jaw area relates to the kidneys, and a clear jaw resembles pure, flowing water. Slender shoulders and a large belly depict water positioned below. Moving hands and feet symbolize water flowing in all directions. Shaking one’s hair and body indicates water in motion, restless. A long lower back signifies the water-like length of the foot in relation to the sun.)<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>The back is governed by the Governing Vessel; it extends naturally along the back. The water of the Taiyang flows upwards to the heavens. When the water is weak, the people indulge in it and toy with it, resulting in many deaths. Therefore, people do not show reverence and often deceive others. Many who die meet their end due to excessive labor and exhaustion, as the quality of water is soft and weak, making it unsuitable for overexertion. In autumn and winter, it is the time when metal and water generate one another; in spring, wood releases the water&#39;s essence, and in summer, fire dries up the water. Hence, sickness arises in spring and summer. The foot&#39;s Shaoyin cold water governs qi; when it is muddy, it reflects a lowly state, like marshes and rivers that absorb filth. The foot&#39;s Shaoyin connects with the foot&#39;s Taiyang. The Taiyi person corresponds to the right foot of Taiyang, while the Shizhi person corresponds to the left foot of Taiyang. Those with a serene appearance under Taiyang suggest a robust blood and vitality, characterized by beautiful eyebrows which contain fine hairs. The cheek represents the supportive aspect. When one appears amiable and graceful, it indicates the Taiyang&#39;s elevated status, like having noble support. Serene means calm and unmoving. The Shaoyu person corresponds to the left foot of Taiyang, while the multitude corresponds to the right foot of Taiyang. Those under Taiyang exhibiting gentle and pristine features refer to a strong blood and vitality below, with firm flesh at the heel. Gentle and pristine reflects the state of flowing like water&#39;s swirl. Pristine signifies clearness, like the purity of water. Those referred to as the multitude inhabit a flat land by the sea, embodying the clarity and form of water below.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>The people of the桎 are likened to those residing in the high hills and valleys, who, like the mountains above, are serene and unmoving. Water is inherently restless, thus those shaped by water move their hands and feet, twisting and swaying. When they dwell amidst high hills and valleys, subjected to the authority of the state, their limbs become as if shackled yet remain at ease and unmoving.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: If one obtains the form but not the color, what then? Qi Bo replied: The form surpasses the color, and the color surpasses the form; when it is the time of dominance, years will add on, leading to ailments or distress if lost. When form and color are harmonious, there will be wealth, nobility, and great joy. The Yellow Emperor further inquired: Is it known when form and color dominate? Qi Bo responded: Those who are born in years marked by misfortune, particularly those commonly associated with increase, including the ages of seven, sixteen, twenty-five, thirty-four, forty-three, fifty-two, and sixty-one, all represent significant misfortunes; one must ensure personal peace during these times. When affected, there is illness; when lost, there is worry. During these times, one should avoid deceitful acts; this is called the year of taboo.</p>
<p>In explanation, when form surpasses color, it is like a person of great horns, whose color is yellow; when color surpasses form, it resembles a person of great womb, whose color is blue. Form signifies the substance of the five elements; color signifies the essence of the five elements. When form and essence are in harmony, they resonate with the creation of heaven and earth, thus leading to wealth, nobility, and great joy. Those referred to as &quot;upper and lower,&quot; mean individuals under the influence of minor and major powers, harmonizing hands and feet, the three yang, while the three yin do not participate.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>As one ages, it begins at seven years, and every nine years thereafter, there are significant taboos concerning the harmony of color and form. Seven years represent the lesser yang; adding nine years makes it sixteen, and adding another nine makes it twenty-five. The reasoning is that for those with three yang in their hands and feet, starting from the lesser yang at seven, and adding the extreme yang at the end of nine brings regret. The cumulative years of these additions are the strongest taboos for the individual; one must not neglect their place. If they are affected, illness may ensue, leading to neglect and thus worry.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Your explanation of the pulse&#39;s fluctuations and the conditions of blood and qi—how does it reflect on physical form and energy?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Above the foot yangming, when blood and qi are abundant, the beard is handsome and long; when blood is insufficient but qi is abundant, the beard is short. If qi is scarce and blood is ample, there will be less beard; if both are lacking, there will be no beard, and the lips might be overdrawn.</p>
<p>Below the foot yangming, when blood and qi are full, body hair grows beautifully long to the chest; when blood is rich but qi is poor, body hair is short to the navel. When moving, they can lift their feet well, but the toes are lean and the feet are cold. If blood is inadequate and qi is in excess, the flesh may appear but be weak; if both are scarce, there will be no hair, and if present, it will be sparse and emaciated, leading to weakness and numbness in the feet.</p>
<p>Note: The growth of hair signifies the vitality of skin and flesh, reflecting the warm and penetrative qualities of the blood and qi. The three yang of the hands and feet each follow their respective meridians and divide where the skin is concerned, which is why the Emperor inquired about the state of the pulse to understand physical condition and energy.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>The flow of the meridians depends on the circulation of qi and blood, allowing us to understand the vitality within the body. The form refers to the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. For the Yangming meridian in the legs, its upward path moves past the corners of the mouth, encircling the lips and connecting to the承浆 (Chengjiang). Therefore, when the blood and qi within the skin are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long; when blood is scarce and qi is plentiful, the beard is short; when qi is scarce and blood is plentiful, the beard is sparse; and when both qi and blood are deficient, there is no beard at all. Abundant blood seeps through the skin, producing fine hair, while qi is what nourishes the skin, filling the body and enriching the hair. </p>
<p>Thus, the beard and hair on the face and body all rely on the qi and blood in the skin for growth. Therefore, when qi is deficient, the beard is sparse; when blood is deficient, the beard is short; and when both are deficient, there is no beard. When blood and qi are insufficient to nourish the skin, leading to a lack of fullness in the flesh, there are many lines and wrinkles. </p>
<p>For the downward path of the Yangming meridian, it travels through the chest, descends to the navel, traverses from the knee to the ankle, so when the blood and qi in the lower skin are abundant, the body hair is attractive and lengthy down to the chest; when blood is abundant and qi is scarce, the body hair is beautiful but short down to the navel; when both blood and qi are lacking, there is no hair, or if present, it is thin and withered. The toes have little flesh; if the feet are prone to cold, it signifies the qi that nourishes the skin, enriching the body and hair. Coldness in the hands and feet results in frostbite. The blood warms the skin and nourishes the flesh; if blood is deficient, the flesh becomes cold. Weakness and numbness in the feet arise from insufficient blood and qi, which fail to nourish the tendons and bones.</p>
<p>At the upper part of the lesser yang, when the blood and qi are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long; when blood is abundant and qi is scarce, the beard is beautiful but short; when blood is scarce and qi is abundant, there is less beard; and when both blood and qi are deficient, there is no beard.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>When affected by cold and dampness, one suffers from rheumatism, leading to bone pain and shriveled nails. In the lower part of the foot&#39;s lesser yang, if blood and qi are abundant, then the hair on the shank is long and beautiful, and the outer ankle is swollen; if there is more blood and less qi, the hair on the shank is short but still beautiful, and the outer ankle&#39;s skin is thick and firm; if there is less blood and more qi, there is sparse hair on the shank, and the outer ankle&#39;s skin is thin and soft; if both blood and qi are deficient, there is no hair, and the outer ankle is thin with no flesh.</p>
<p>(Note: The foot&#39;s lesser yang meridian ascends in front of and behind the ear, passes the cheekbone, and moves down to the neck and nape. Therefore, when the blood and qi in the skin are plentiful, the beard grows long; if blood is abundant and qi is deficient, the beard will be short but still beautiful. Hair is the surplus of blood, hence when there is more blood and less qi, it can be short and still attractive. The skin, being yang, contrasts with the muscles and bones, which are yin. Illness in the yang is referred to as wind, while illness in the yin is called rheumatism. Nails are the surplus of the muscles, and when both blood and qi are low, they cannot nourish the muscles and bones. This allows the cold and dampness to linger, causing bone pain and shriveled nails. The meridian that descends follows the outer edge of the knee, moves down in front of the fibula, reaches the tip of the fibula, exits in front of the outer ankle, and follows the foot&#39;s tarsus. Therefore, when the blood and qi in the lower skin and flesh are abundant, the hair on the shank is long and beautiful, and the outer ankle is plump; if blood is abundant, the skin is thick and firm; if blood is scant, the skin is thin and soft. This is the reason why blood seeps into the skin lightly.)<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>The foot&#39;s sun meridian begins at the inner corner of the eye, winding up along the two eyebrows to the forehead and crossing the crown. Therefore, when the blood and qi are abundant, the eyebrows are beautiful and have fine hairs; when there is excessive blood and insufficient qi, the eyebrows are unattractive and the face lacks proper features; when there is little blood and abundant qi, the face is plump; when blood and qi are balanced, the complexion is lovely.</p>
<p>Below the foot&#39;s sun meridian, when blood and qi are abundant, the heel is full, the flesh is plump, and the heel is strong; when there is insufficient qi and excess blood, the heel looks thin and empty; when both blood and qi are deficient, the tendons are easily twisted, and pain occurs under the heel. </p>
<p>[Note: “少理” should be interpreted as “小理.”] </p>
<p>[Note: The abundant blood and qi in the skin lead to beautiful eyebrows with fine hairs. The nourishing heat of the flesh, which produces hair, derives from postnatal nourishment, resulting in facial hair above and body hair below, all developing after birth.]<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The eyebrow is generated from pre-natal essence; thus, beautiful eyebrows are those that have been nourished by rich blood and energy. The fine hairs are the long hairs within the eyebrows, which grow due to abundant blood and energy, and are a product of post-natal development. Poor eyebrows lack luster and appear withered. A face with many fine lines has numerous small textures, indicating a lack of energy, which cannot properly nourish the skin. When there is little blood and much energy, the face becomes plump; this is how energy fills the pores. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The heart connects to the pulse; its vitality shows in the color.&quot; The &quot;Smooth Pulse&quot; chapter says: &quot;When the pulse is slow, yang energy flourishes, its color is bright, and the face is radiant.&quot; When blood and energy are harmonious, it means that the blood and energy in the meridians and skin are well-regulated, leading to a fresh and beautiful complexion. The essence from the organs and viscera all derives from the meridian of the Greater Yang, which governs all the yang channels. If there is cramping pain in the heels, it indicates a deficiency in blood and energy, which cannot nourish the tendons and bones.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>On the hand of the Yangming channel, when blood and qi are abundant, the beard is beautiful; when blood is low and qi is abundant, the beard appears poor; when both blood and qi are scarce, there is no beard. Below the hand of the Yangming channel, when blood and qi are abundant, the armpit hair is beautiful, and the hand feels warm and fleshy; when both blood and qi are scarce, the hand is thin and cold.</p>
<p>(Note: The Yangming channel ascends from the wrist, crosses the mouth, enters the center, and ascends to the nostrils, which is why when blood and qi are abundant, the beard looks good; if poor, it is sparse and withered. The descending channel follows the arm, enters between the two tendons, and exits at Hegu, hence when blood and qi are abundant, the armpit hair is beautiful, and the hand feels warm. When both blood and qi are scarce, the hand feels thin and cold.)</p>
<p>On the hand of the Shaoyang channel, when blood and qi are abundant, the eyebrows are beautifully long, and the ear color is nice; when blood and qi are scarce, the ears become dry and unattractive. Below the hand of the Shaoyang channel, when blood and qi are abundant, the hand is fleshy and warm; when both blood and qi are scarce, it is thin and cold; when qi is low and blood is abundant, it is thin and has many pulses.</p>
<p>(Note: The Shaoyang channel ascends and exits in front of the ear, crosses the cheek to the corner of the eye, which is why when blood and qi are abundant, the eyebrows look beautifully long. The descending channel goes from the shoulder to the elbow and up the arm, hence when blood and qi are abundant, the hand is fleshy and warm. The Shaoyang blood and qi circulate on the surface, and when abundant, the skin is relaxed and the flesh is rich, suitable for grasping. Many pulses indicate a thin skin and flesh with prominent veins.)</p>
<p>On the hand of the Taiyang channel, when blood and qi are abundant, there is plenty of whiskers, and the face appears plump; when both blood and qi are scarce, the face is thin and has an unattractive color.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Under the influence of the sun, when the blood and vital energy are abundant, the flesh of the palms is full; when both are insufficient, the palms are thin and cold. </p>
<p>(Note: The sun&#39;s meridian rises along the path between the cheekbone, jaw, ear, nose, and eyes. Therefore, when the blood and vital energy are abundant in the skin, there is more facial hair, and the face is fuller; when both are insufficient, the face appears thin and has a poor color. The sun represents the main energy of all yang, and descending along the shoulder, arm, and wrist, when blood and energy are abundant, the palms are full; when they are insufficient, the palms are thin and cold.)</p>
<p>Beautiful eyebrows indicate that the foot&#39;s solar meridian has abundant energy and blood; unattractive eyebrows indicate less energy and blood. Those who are plump and radiant have excess blood and energy; those who are plump but not radiant have excess energy but insufficient blood; those who are thin and lack radiance have both blood and energy insufficient. By examining the form to determine the excess or deficiency of energy, one can discern the flow and stagnation.</p>
<p>(Note: Beautiful eyebrows indicate abundant energy and blood in the foot&#39;s solar meridian; unattractive eyebrows indicate less. Plump muscles with a rich color suggest sufficient blood and energy. Indeed, the foot&#39;s solar meridian is the ruling meridian of all yang; when the energy and blood are abundant in the solar meridian and the eyebrows are beautiful, it indicates that all yang meridians have excess energy and blood, leading to plump and radiant muscles. Thus, one should carefully examine the skin and flesh for excess or deficiency of energy and blood to understand the flow and stagnation. Flow and stagnation refer to the interaction of blood and energy in the skin and meridians. Understanding the excess or deficiency of flow and stagnation leads to knowing how to adjust it.)<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p>
<h3>Five Sounds and Five Flavors</h3>
<p>The sage observes the colors. Yellow and red indicate an abundance of heat, while blue and white suggest less heat. Black indicates a surplus of blood and a deficiency of qi. Those with beautiful eyebrows have a lot of blood from the sun, while those with full beards and long mustaches have less yang and more blood. Those with fine beards have an abundance of blood from the yangming. This is just how it is in due course.</p>
<p>(Note: Red represents summer, and yellow signifies late summer, thus yellow and red indicate more heat, which is the yang energy. Blue represents spring and white represents autumn, leading to blue and white indicating less heat. Black corresponds to the winter watery phase, in which yang energy is deeply concealed, resulting in more blood and less qi. The three yin and three yang represent the six energies of heaven, also aligning with the four seasons: the first energy is the spring wind wood, the second is the lesser yang fire, the third is the lesser yin fire, the fourth is the greater yin damp earth, the fifth is the yangming dry metal, and the final energy is the greater sun cold water. There are these six energies in heaven, and humans also possess these six energies. Correspondingly, this aligns with the organs and meridians, divided into twelve categories of hands and feet. In the yin and yang of heaven, there are merely the six energies of great and small. Hence, beautiful eyebrows indicate an abundance of blood from the sun, full beards and long mustaches indicate lesser yang and more blood, while fine beards indicate an abundance of blood from the yangming.)<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p>
<h3>The Needlework Chapter</h3>
<p>People of the Double Yang, vibrant and elevated, have swift speech and high steps. Their heart and lung contain abundant energy, and their Yang energy is flourishing and vigorous. Therefore, the spirit moves first, and the energy follows.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Why do people of the Double Yang not have their spirits moving first? Qi Bo replied: Such a person contains some Yin. The Yellow Emperor asked: How do you know they contain some Yin? Qi Bo answered: Those abundant in Yang are often joyful; those abundant in Yin are often angry. Those who frequently express anger are easily understood; hence, they are said to contain some Yin. The separation and combination of Yin and Yang is complex, therefore their spirit cannot move first.</p>
<p>The heart represents the supreme Yang, while the liver signifies the minor Yang within Yin. The heart governs joy, while the liver governs anger. The heart houses the spirit, and the liver houses the soul, with the soul following the spirit in its movements. When the spirit moves first, it indicates a separation of spirit and soul. A person of Double Yang with substantial Yin represents a union of Yin and Yang. The intricacies of the separation and combination of Yin and Yang lead to the spirit and soul being united, hence the spirit cannot move first.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br><strong>Tian Tong Chapter</strong></p>
<p>People of the Greater Yin are greedy and unbenevolent, humble and tranquil, preferring to remain within while despising the outside. Their hearts are harmonious but do not express themselves; they do not seize timely opportunities, only acting after others have moved. This is the character of those of Greater Yin. </p>
<p><em>[Note: People of Greater Yin are overly inclined towards Yin. Such individuals are cunning, hence greedy yet unkind. They are inwardly focused and outwardly dismissive, thus preferring to stay in while shunning the outside. &quot;Tranquil and clean&quot; reflects a pure appearance. &quot;Humble and coordinated&quot; denotes a respectful demeanor. A heart that is harmonious yet unexpressed shows a soft and yielding nature. Not seizing the moment indicates a failure to grasp current affairs. &quot;Acting after others&quot; means they only move after observing others, demonstrating a submissive attitude.]</em></p>
<p>People of the Lesser Yin possess slight greed and a thieving spirit; when they see others lose, they often feel as though they have gained. They take pleasure in causing harm and injury, and when they see others gain honor, they become resentful and angry, harboring a heart that is sickly and ungrateful. This is the character of those of Lesser Yin.</p>
<p><em>[Note: People of Lesser Yin are slightly inclined towards Yin, hence their slight greed. Yet they possess a cunning nature, lacking foresight, thus they often harbor malicious intent, rejoicing in others&#39; losses while resenting their gains.]</em><a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>The person of the Sun dwells in abundance; they speak grandly of great matters, yet are incapable and speak empty words; their ambitions spread wide like the four corners of the world, acting without regard for right or wrong; in their affairs, they act as if it were normal for them to rely on themselves, and though they may fail, they do not regret their actions. This is the person of the Sun.</p>
<p>The person of the Less Sun is discerning and values themselves highly; if they hold a minor position, they elevate themselves accordingly; they prefer external relations while refusing internal attachments. This is the person of the Less Sun.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>The person who embodies harmony of yin and yang lives in tranquility; they are untroubled by desires, neither fearful nor overly joyful; they naturally conform to the circumstances, engaging without contention; adapting to the changes of the times, they remain respectful yet humble. To speak without taking action is to achieve the highest form of governance. </p>
<p>[Note: Living in tranquility refers to an attitude of calmness and emptiness. Being untroubled by desires implies a peaceful mind and minimal craving. Conforming to circumstances without contention means no rivalry with others or the world. Adapting to change signifies following the flow of time, akin to the ways of Yu, Ji, and Yan Hui. Maintaining respect while being humble enhances one’s virtue. Speaking without action reflects governance through non-action. The highest form of governance is that which does not require governing. This is the manifestation of balanced yin and yang, and only the wise can embody and practice this, leading to a rectified heart and improved self, capable of harmonizing the world.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What are the five states of governing people? The Lesser Teacher replied: The person of greater yin has much yin and no yang. Their yin blood is turbid, their guard energy is insufficient, yin and yang are unharmonized, leading to lax tendons and thick skin, without sickness or diarrhea, unable to be moved.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>People of the lesser yin have more yin and less yang, hence their yin blood is thick and turbid. Yang energy circulates through the channels, but without yang, the defensive energy becomes stagnant. With an excess of yin blood, the tendons are lax. With an excess of blood and insufficient qi, the skin becomes hardened and thick—this is a severe imbalance of yin and yang. If not treated, it cannot be remedied.</p>
<p>People of the lesser yin have abundant yin and less yang, having a small stomach and a large intestine, and their six bowels are unbalanced. The yangming pulse is small while the taiyang pulse is large. It is necessary to carefully regulate this; their blood can easily be lost, and their qi can quickly fail.</p>
<p>The small stomach and large intestine indicate that the upper part is yang and the lower part is yin. With an excess of yin and less yang, the imbalance of the six bowels follows. Yang energy originates in the middle jiao; the small yangming pulse suggests a deficiency in the source of yang. The yang energy of taiyang arises from water, and the large taiyang pulse indicates a strong presence of cold water energy. This imbalance of yin and yang leads to easy loss of blood and rapid failure of qi, necessitating careful examination of their strength and deficiency for proper regulation.</p>
<p>People of the greater yang have more yang and less yin. It is essential to carefully balance this, avoiding the loss of their yin while discharging their yang. If the yin is heavily lost, it can lead to derangement.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>Those whose yin and yang are both depleted die suddenly and without awareness. <strong>[Note: If one depletes their yin while losing their yang, yang becomes the firmness of yin. If the yin essence is heavily depleted, it leads to insanity. Both yin and yang being depleted results in sudden death. For yang is the firmness of yin, and yin guards yang; yang energy arises within yin, so if yin is heavily depleted, yang will also be depleted.]</strong> </p>
<p>People of the Lesser Yang have more yang and less yin. Their channels are small but their networks are large, with blood in the interior and qi on the exterior. They possess solid yin and empty yang; only by depleting their networks do they appear strong. When qi is depleted, sickness arises, and the central energy is insufficient, which prevents illness from emerging. <strong>[Note: Small channels but large networks refer to the interior as yin and the exterior as yang. Blood is within while qi is outside, with blood representing yin and qi representing yang. Therefore, wanting to solidify yin while allowing yang to be empty, only depleting their networks gives strength, just as depleting qi leads to its exhaustion and illness. Thus, central energy becomes insufficient, preventing illness from arising.]</strong> </p>
<p>Those whose yin and yang are in harmony have a balanced qi of yin and yang, with regulated blood and vessels. They carefully examine their yin and yang, observe their pathogenic factors, and maintain a peaceful demeanor.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>To assess excess and deficiency: if there is excess, reduce it; if there is deficiency, replenish it; if neither excess nor deficiency, rely on the meridian system. This is how one adjusts the Yin and Yang and distinguishes among the five types of persons.</p>
<p>[Note: The balance of Yin and Yang involves their energies. Regulate the blood vessels carefully by diagnosing their Yin and Yang, as blood also has Yin and Yang. Evaluate their correct and incorrect conditions, and stabilize their appearance, reflecting the Yin and Yang within the form. To assess excess and deficiency: if there is excess, reduce it, if there is deficiency, replenish it, adjusting the balance of energy. If there is neither excess nor deficiency, rely on the meridian to assess the reality of the blood. This is how one adjusts the Yin and Yang and distinguishes among the five types of persons.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The five types of persons do not have conflicts among themselves, and when they suddenly come together, they are unaware of their actions. How can they be distinguished? The Master replied: Those who are like the general populace are not comparable to the five types of persons, therefore there are five groups of five, totaling twenty-five individuals, and the five types of persons do not belong to them. The five types of persons are still not compatible with the general populace.</p>
<p>[Note: The individuals embodying the Yin and Yang of the five types are distinct from the twenty-five individuals of the five tones, and they are still not compatible with the general populace. Hence, one must observe their forms to differentiate them.]<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we distinguish the five types of people? The Lesser Teacher replied: Those of the Greater Yin type have a dark complexion, their minds heavy, and they grow tall and firm, with their knees not yet bent. This is the characteristic of the Greater Yin person.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Dark complexion&quot; refers to being shadowy and without brightness. &quot;Heavy mind&quot; indicates humility. As the lower body represents Yin, they appear tall and firm. &quot;Knees&quot; refer to the growth of the lower legs.)</p>
<p>Those of the Lesser Yin type have a clear and subtle appearance, naturally inclined towards cunning; they stand restlessly and move as if lurking. This is the characteristic of the Lesser Yin person.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Clear appearance&quot; means a cool demeanor. &quot;Subtle&quot; reflects a closed and hidden demeanor, as they harbor malicious thoughts. They stand restlessly because of their impulsive nature. &quot;Moving as if lurking&quot; indicates deep contemplation and introspection.)</p>
<p>Those of the Greater Yang type have a lofty and expansive demeanor, with a body that bends and flexes. This is the characteristic of the Greater Yang person.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Lofty&quot; refers to an elevated and commanding presence. &quot;Expansive&quot; means a strong and assertive stance.)<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>The person who folds his knees behind himself and leans back is acting with arrogance.

<p>The person of lesser yang stands with an inclination to look upward and moves with a swaying motion. His arms and elbows often extend behind his back—this is the nature of a lesser yang person.</p>
<p>(Note: Standing with an inclination to look upward is the same as the posture of folding the knees. Moving with a swaying motion is a sign of initial vigorous activity. The frequent extension of the arms and hands behind the back signifies a tendency to pull their hands back, reflecting a light arrogance without the appearance of folded hands in respect.)</p>
<p>A person who embodies both yin and yang presents a dignified, relaxed, and pleasant demeanor, with a gentle and agreeable look; their eyes are expressive and refined. Everyone calls them a gentleman. This is the true nature of a person who embodies harmony between yin and yang.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Dignified&quot; refers to a self-composed demeanor; &quot;relaxed&quot; indicates a calm temperament. &quot;Pleasant&quot; signifies amiability. &quot;Expressive&quot; denotes pleasing eyes. &quot;Refined&quot; suggests possessing good qualities. The key to humanity lies in the eyes. A balanced heart leads to clarity and beauty in their gaze. This is the demeanor of a gentleman in harmony with yin and yang.)<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br><strong>On Diagnosing Diseases: The Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When observing a person&#39;s eyes, if there is slight swelling in the eye socket resembling someone just waking up, and if the neck pulse is active with coughing, pressing on the hands and feet shows no response, this indicates edema due to wind and water. </p>
<p>[Note: The pulse of the foot&#39;s solar meridian begins at the eyes and exits at the neck. The upper part of the solar meridian is governed by cold water. The energy of the solar meridian circulates on the skin&#39;s surface, so this water overflows between the skin layers, causing slight swelling in the eye socket. If the neck pulse is active and the skin is swollen with coughing, it indicates that water is retained in the skin and affects the lung energy. Wind and water, in this context, are caused by external exposure to wind, which causes the water to disperse.]</p>
<p>A slippery texture on the skin of the pulse indicates wind. If the flesh at the pulse is weak, this suggests a need for rest. If the flesh is detached, it indicates an imbalance of cold and heat that has not been treated. If the skin is slippery and moist, this also indicates wind. If the skin is coarse like dried fish scales, this suggests water retention from fluid intake. A pulse that is hot and vigorous indicates a warm disease; if the pulse is strong and slippery, it suggests a condition that is emerging.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>When the skin at the wrist is cold and the pulse is weak, it indicates a deficiency of qi. When the skin at the wrist is first hot and then cold, it signifies an alternation of cold and heat. When the skin at the wrist is initially cold, then becomes hot after a prolonged duration, it also indicates an alternation of cold and heat.</p>
<p>(Note: The moisture that accumulates on the skin is due to the presence of wind, which stirs up the bodily fluids. The fat mentioned here refers to the fatty membrane between the muscle fibers. When the skin is smooth and moist with fat, it indicates the presence of wind in the muscles. In this context, the skin represents the yang, while the muscles and bones represent the yin. Conditions affecting the yang are referred to as wind, and those affecting the yin are termed as bi syndromes. If the skin is rough, it suggests that wind is causing blockage between the muscles and bones. This allows us to ascertain the severity of the wind-afflicting condition based on the texture of the skin.</p>
<p>The muscles are connected to the essence of the five organs and are governed by the spleen. Thus, when the flesh at the wrist is weak, it indicates a deficiency in the spleen, which leads to difficulty in resting properly. &quot;Difficulty&quot; here refers to sluggishness. If the flesh deteriorates, it suggests a loss of form. The concepts of cold and heat reflect a deficiency in yin and yang as well as blood and qi.)<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>When Yang is deficient, there is susceptibility to cold; when Yin is deficient, there is fever. Both Yin and Yang, as well as form and qi, have been depleted, leading to ineffective treatment. Like the scales of a withered fish, the skin develops cold grains. Cold is the essence of water. This water pathogen seeps inward, hence the cold appearance on the outside. In cases of warm illness, cold toxins are hidden in the skin and manifest as warm disease in spring. Therefore, when the skin is hot and the pulse is strong and agitated, it indicates warm illness; if the pulse is strong and slippery, it suggests the disease is emerging from the outside. When the skin is cold and the pulse is weak, it indicates insufficient qi. Qi warms the skin and meat, originating from Yin and emerging from within to the outside, hence it is known that the internal is leaking and the external is deficient. This is how one diagnoses internal causes through the pulse at the wrist. The skin&#39;s response—first hot then cold, or first cold then hot—reflects the interplay of cold and heat, as the wrist governs the energies of three Yin and three Yang. The warm sensation isolated in the elbow relates to the heat above the waist, while the isolated warmth in the hand pertains to the heat below the waist. The warmth isolated in the front of the elbow signifies heat in the chest.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>If there is heat at the back of the elbow, it indicates heat in the shoulders and back. If heat is felt in the arms, it signifies heat in the waist and abdomen. If there is coarse heat three or four inches below the elbow, it suggests the presence of worms in the intestines. Heat in the palms indicates heat in the abdomen, while coldness in the palms indicates coldness in the abdomen. If there are blue blood vessels in the white flesh of fish, it signifies coldness in the stomach.</p>
<p>(Note: The hand Taiyin meridian begins from the finger&#39;s &quot;Shou Shang&quot; point, passes through &quot;Shu,&quot; travels along the meridian, and enters the &quot;Shiez&quot; point at the elbow. The external qi and blood travel from the hand Yangming&#39;s &quot;Wuli&quot; along the arm and inversely through the meridian. The space from the elbow down is measured in inches, while the space from the hand up is measured in inches as well. Heat at the back of the elbow indicates heat above the waist, while heat in the hands indicates heat below the waist. This method assesses the state of the body using the superficial pulse, hence it reflects bodily diagnostics inversely. The front of the elbow corresponds to the hand Jueyin&#39;s &quot;Quze,&quot; while the back corresponds to the hand Shaoyang&#39;s &quot;Tianjing.&quot; This principle indicates that the arms hang down, with assessments for above done upwards, and assessments for below done downwards, front checking forwards and back checking backwards.)<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>The term &quot;the position of the elbow and hand&quot; refers to the back side of the arm. The area where the arm meets the hand and where the fish appears above is considered the front of the arm. The back side is associated with Yang, thus representing the exterior of the body; the front side corresponds to Yin, thus representing the interior, particularly the waist, abdomen, intestines, and stomach. This means that the external measurement corresponds to the seasonal flanks, while the internal measurement relates to the large principles within the abdomen.</p>
<p>When the measurement (or pulse) is hot and the person&#39;s response is large, blood should be drawn. When the measurement is firm and large but the pulse is extremely small, there is a reduction in Qi and distress, which can lead to immediate death. </p>
<p>(Note: A hot measurement with a large response indicates an excess of Yang energy, thus necessitating bloodletting. The skin represents Yang, while the blood vessels represent Yin. A firm and large measurement with a small pulse indicates a dominance of Yang and a depletion of Yin externally. A decrease in Qi is due to internal dominance of Yang and depletion of Yin.)</p>
<p>Red eyes indicate an illness related to the heart, white relates to the lungs, blue indicates an issue with the liver, yellow pertains to the spleen, and black is associated with the kidneys; an undefined yellow indicates a disease within the chest.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>The blood and qi of the five organs circulate within the channels and manifest at the pulse points; the changes in the qi and blood of the five organs are reflected in color and emerge from the eyes. The essence of the five organs is all concentrated in the eyes, forming vision. The yellow color that cannot be named is a hue of yellow mixed with shades of black, white, blue, and red. When illness is located in the chest, the qi of the five organs emerges from within the diaphragm, thus the observed colors appear as such.</p>
<p>When diagnosing eye pain, if the red pulse rises and falls, it indicates a Taiyang disease; if it rises from below to above, it indicates a Yangming disease; and if it travels from outside to inside, it indicates a Shaoyang disease. </p>
<p>In this context, Taiyang corresponds to the upper part of the eye, hence the pulse rising and falling indicates Taiyang disease. Yangming corresponds to the lower part of the eye, thus the pulse rising from below to above indicates Yangming disease. The Shaoyang pulse runs along the outer canthus of the eye, so if it travels from outside to inside, it indicates Shaoyang disease.</p>
<p>When diagnosing cold and heat, if the red pulse reaches the pupil—from one pulse to one year indicates death; from one pulse to half indicates a year and a half until death; from two pulses to two years indicates death; from two pulses to half indicates two and a half years until death; from three pulses to three years indicates death.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Cold and heat refer to the energies of water and fire, yin and yang. The heart governs the encompassing energy, originating from the kidneys and returning to the lower part of the heart, functioning as a single organ that controls the pulse. The pupil (of the eye) corresponds to the essence of the kidneys. The toxins of the water organ ascend to interact with the fire organ, while the energy of the fire organ descends to interact with the yin; this interplay of yin and yang is said to be incurable after death.</p>
<p>To examine toothache, if the presence of heat is found in the yang aspect, it is independent heat. If it is on the left, it indicates left heat; on the right, right heat; above, upper heat; below, lower heat.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tooth pain is referred to as dental caries. The upper teeth belong to the Hand Yangming Large Intestine Meridian, and the lower teeth belong to the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian. Therefore, if heat is present in the yang pulse, it must be independent heat. The position of the pulse in the left and right or upper and lower correlates with the condition, and the heat is similarly divided among left, right, upper, and lower.</p>
<p>To examine the blood vessels: a predominance of red and heat indicates issues; predominance of blue and pain indicates problems; black indicates prolonged obstruction; the presence of red, black, and blue all together indicates cold and heat.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>【Note: The text discusses the twelve channels of the body, which are associated with the skin. A predominance of blue in color indicates pain, black indicates numbness, yellow-red indicates heat, and a predominance of white indicates cold; all five colors represent variations of cold and heat.】 When the body hurts and the skin appears slightly yellow, with yellowish teeth and yellow claws, this indicates jaundice. If one sleeps comfortably and has yellow-red urine, with a weak and thin pulse, that person will have little appetite. 【Note: Body pain arises from issues in the flesh. The yellow color indicates problems in the skin. Yellowish teeth reflect issues with the bones, while yellow claws indicate problems with the tendons. Jaundice is associated with the spleen. The spleen&#39;s illness leads to comfort in lying down. The small intestine is considered the red intestine, linked to the heart. The heart governs the blood vessels; therefore, yellow-red urine and a weak pulse signal issues in the vessels. Yellow-red urine indicates heat in the lower body. Little appetite suggests weakness in the upper body. The earth is in the center, with its effects radiating outward.】 If an infant shows hair on its head standing upright, it is certain to die. 【Note: Hair is the surplus of blood, generated from the essence of yin. If hair stands upright, it means there is only ascension without descent. The balance of ascent and descent is essential to avoid death.】 The appearance of blue veins in the ears indicates pulling pain.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>[Note: The kidneys govern bones and open to the ears; thus, when the green vessels arise between the ears, they indicate a dominance of sinews and bones that brings pain. This follows the previous text regarding how human blood and qi begin from the essence generated by the kidneys.]</p>
<p>Bian Que’s Difficulties </p>
<p>Observing the Color </p>
<p>The Thirteenth Difficulty states: The classic mentions that if one sees a color but cannot discern the pulse, and instead finds a pulse that counters (the expected), death ensues; if one finds a pulse that nourishes (the expected), the illness will cease. How should color and pulse correspond? [Note: The &quot;Lingshu&quot; in Chapter Four states: To see the color and know the disease is termed &#39;bright&#39;; to examine the pulse and know the disease is termed &#39;spirit&#39;. Inquiring about the disease and knowing its location is termed &#39;skillful&#39;. Color, pulse, form, and flesh must not be lost to each other. If the color is green, the pulse should be wiry; if red, the pulse should be surging and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be middle-sized and slow; if white, the pulse should be floating and thin; if black, the pulse should be deep and slippery. The notion of not being able to match color with pulse refers to their disconnection. If color and pulse do not correspond, whatever pulse is perceivable, if it counters, indicates death; if it nourishes, the illness will cease.] Thus, the five organs correspond to five colors, all visible on the face, should also correlate within the radial pulse. For instance, if the color is green, the pulse should be wiry and rapid; if red, the pulse should be superficial, large, and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large; if white, the pulse should be superficial, thin, and short; if black, the pulse should be deep and slippery. This is what is meant by the correspondence between the five colors and the pulses. [Note: The correspondence between color and pulse is represented this way, hence the concept of seeing the color and discerning the pulse.]<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>The five organs each have their own sounds, colors, smells, and tastes, which correspond to the pulse at the inch and the chi (cubit). Those that do not correspond indicate illness. For example, if the color is green, the pulse is floating, thready, and short; if it is strong and slow, it represents overcoming; if it is floating, large, and diffuse, it is small and slippery, representing generation. </p>
<p>(Note: The reference to green illustrates how overcoming and generating work. Green is the color of the liver; a floating, thready, and short pulse indicates the lung pulse, which signifies metal overcoming wood. A strong and slow pulse indicates the spleen pulse, representing wood overcoming earth, thus illustrating overcoming. A floating, large, and diffuse pulse indicates the heart pulse, signifying wood generating fire; a small and slippery pulse indicates the kidney pulse, representing water generating wood. This is known as the pulse of overcoming indicates death, while the pulse of generation indicates that the illness resolves itself.)</p>
<p>In the Sixteen Difficulties it states: indeed. If the liver pulse is detected, the external signs are clean, with a bluish complexion and good anger; the internal signs show movement on the left side of the navel, pressing it firmly feels painful; the illness includes fullness and stagnation in the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, and muscle cramps. If these symptoms exist, it is the liver; if they do not, it is not.</p>
<p>(Note: The detection of the liver pulse means diagnosing the string-like pulse. The liver and gallbladder are linked, thus being an organ of clarity; hence the cleanliness. The liver is known as the general&#39;s organ, which allows for good anger. The bluish hue reflects the color of the liver. The other signs indicate favorable pulse conditions. The left side of the navel is related to the liver. A firm press indicates moving energy; when pressed, it feels solid and immovable or painful.)<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>Feng says that when liver qi (Yue Zhen) is stagnant, the limbs become full and closed. The commentary states: this is due to wind and indulgent diseases. The jueyin pulse travels through the yin organs; thus, liver illness makes urination and defecation difficult. Cramps occur because the liver governs the tendons. This pertains to the categories of internal conditions and the diseases it governs. </p>
<p>If one is able to discern the heart pulse, the external symptoms are a red face, dry mouth, and a tendency to laugh; the internal manifestation is movement in the area above the navel, which feels firm and painful to touch; the illnesses include anxiety, heart pain, heat in the palms, and dry heaving. If these are present, it indicates heart illness; if not, it does not. </p>
<p>Note that the heart pulse runs through the palm. The true heart is not affected by evil; only the hand’s palm is influenced by it. &quot;Dry heaving&quot; refers to retching. When there is heart illness, fire is abundant, hence the retching. The classics say: all rebellious qi that rises is related to fire; vomiting and sourness pertain to heat.</p>
<p>If one is able to discern the spleen pulse, the external symptoms include a yellow face, good belching, good thinking, and good taste; the internal manifestation occurs at the navel with movement that is firm and painful to touch; the illnesses include abdominal distension, poor digestion, a heavy body with joint pain, laziness, and a desire to lie down and not use the limbs. If these are present, it indicates spleen illness; if not, it does not. </p>
<p>Note that the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that belching is due to cold qi residing in the stomach, which then reverses and disperses upward from below, ultimately leading to belching. The classics say that the spleen governs the limbs.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>If one finds the lung pulse, the external symptoms are a pale face, frequent sneezing, sorrow, lack of joy, and a desire to cry; the internal symptoms show movement in the area below the navel that feels firm and painful upon pressing. The illness presents as wheezing and coughing, with chills and fever. If these signs are present, it indicates a lung condition; if not, it does not.</p>
<p>(Note: Yang qi harmonizes and is abundant in the heart, which manifests through the nose, hence the sneezing. Chills and fever relate to the lung, which governs the skin and hair.)</p>
<p>If one finds the kidney pulse, the external symptoms are a dark face, frequent fear, and yawning; the internal symptoms show movement below the navel that feels firm and painful upon pressing. The illness presents as rebellious qi, urgent pain in the lower abdomen, and diarrhea that is heavy and watery, with coldness in the legs and reverse flow. If these signs are present, it indicates a kidney condition; if not, it does not.</p>
<p>(Note: Insufficient kidney qi leads to fear, the interaction of yin and yang causes yawning, and heavy diarrhea refers to Shaoyin diarrhea.)</p>
<p>The seventeenth difficulty states: If a patient closes their eyes and does not wish to see anyone, the pulse should be strong, urgent, and long, but if instead, the lung pulse is found to be floating, short, and weak, it indicates death.</p>
<p>(Note: The liver opens to the eyes; closing the eyes and not wishing to see others indicates liver disease. Liver disease showing a lung pulse suggests metal (lung) overcoming wood (liver).)</p>
<p>If a patient opens their eyes and is thirsty, with firmness below the heart, the pulse should feel tight and strong and rapid, but if instead, it is found to be deep, weak, and faint, it indicates death.</p>
<p>(Note: A strong illness should correspond to a strong pulse, but if the pulse is weak, it signifies a serious condition.)<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>The sixty-first difficulty states: The text says that to know by sight is called divine, to know by hearing is called sage, to know by inquiry is called skilled, and to know by pulse-taking is called clever. What does this mean? Indeed, to know by sight means to observe the five colors to understand the illness.</p>
<p>[Note: The Suwen, in the chapter on the generation of the five organs, states: The color green like grass signifies death; yellow like bitter orange signifies death; black like charcoal signifies death; red like clotted blood signifies death; white like withered bone signifies death. These are the colors indicating death. Green like emerald signifies life; red like a rooster&#39;s comb signifies life; yellow like a crab&#39;s belly signifies life; white like pig fat signifies life; black like crow&#39;s feathers signifies life. These are the colors indicating life. If born in the heart, it should look as if wrapped in white; if born in the lungs, it should look as if wrapped in red; if born in the liver, it should look as if wrapped in deep blue; if born in the spleen, it should look as if wrapped in gourd fruit; if born in the kidneys, it should look as if wrapped in purple. These are the external signs of the five organs&#39; life colors.]<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>In the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; it is stated that blue-black indicates pain, yellow-red indicates heat, and white indicates cold. It is further mentioned that if red appears on both cheeks and is thumb-sized, even if the illness seems minor, it will certainly end in death. If black appears in the courtyard and is thumb-sized, it will surely result in sudden death without prior illness. Additionally, it states that in diagnosing blood vessels, if there is much red and heat, much blue and pain, and much black, it indicates a prolonged ailment. If all three colors—black, red, and blue—are present, it signifies cold-heat accompanied by body pain, a slightly yellow complexion, yellowish dental deposits, and yellow on the nails, indicating jaundice. Furthermore, when examining a parturient with a red face and a blue tongue, the mother may survive while the child dies; if both face and tongue are blue with foam, the mother dies while the child lives; if both lips and mouth are blue, both the mother and child die, and so forth. Yuan states that the colors of the five internal organs as seen on the face correspond to specific areas and reflect mutual generation and overcoming; thus, observing them can reveal the illness. The text suggests that knowledge from external sources is called &#39;sage,&#39; while knowledge from internal understanding is called &#39;divine,&#39; referring to this distinction. </p>
<p>(Note: The annotations clarify that external knowledge comes from observation and listening, while internal knowledge comes from inquiry and palpation. &#39;Divine&#39; refers to something subtle, while &#39;sage&#39; implies clarity.)<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br><strong>Golden Coffer Essentials</strong> 【Han Dynasty - Zhang Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Observation and Hearing</strong></p>
<p>A question was asked: When the patient&#39;s energy is reflected in the face, I would like to know its implications! The master said: If the tip of the nose is blue, and there is abdominal pain with suffering from cold, the patient will die; if the tip of the nose is slightly black, there is water vapor; if it is yellow, there is cold in the chest; if it is white, there is loss of blood. If there is a slight red not in the right time, the patient will die. If the eyes are perfectly round, the disease cannot be treated. Blue indicates pain, black indicates exhaustion, red indicates wind, yellow suggests difficulty in bowel movements, and bright colors indicate fluid retention. The master said: If breath causes the shoulders to shake, the heart is firm. If breath pulls air from the chest, it indicates cough. If breath comes with a short gasp from an open mouth, it indicates lung atrophy with salivation. The master said: A slight rapid inhalation indicates a disease in the middle jiao; if it is real, treating it will bring recovery, but if it is false, it cannot be treated. In the upper jiao, breathing is rapid; in the lower jiao, breathing is distant; all these are difficult to treat. If breathing moves and shakes vigorously, it cannot be treated. The master said: If the pulse at the wrist moves, it reflects its proper time. For example, if the liver&#39;s color is blue, it follows the colors of each season. If the liver is blue but reflects white, it is not in its proper color, and the pulse will indicate a disease.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br><strong>On Cold Damage - Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observation and Listening</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is floating and surging, the body sweats profusely, there’s persistent wheezing, the patient cannot take in water, the body feels numb, and there are alternating states of calm and agitation, this indicates a critical condition. Furthermore, it is unclear which organ has first suffered. If there is sweating and persistent wheezing, this indicates the lung has been primarily affected. If the yang remains alone, the body appears smoke-damaged, and the patient stares with a swaying head, this indicates the heart has failed. If the lips and mouth turn bluish, and the limbs become cold, this indicates the liver has failed. If the mouth is dark and the sweat is soft and yellow, this indicates the spleen has failed. If there is loss of urination and defecation, with wild talk and a fixed gaze, this indicates the kidney has failed. </p>
<p>A question is posed: The skilled doctor knows by observation, the moderately skilled by inquiry, and the unskilled by pulse diagnosis. I wish to hear more! The teacher replied: When a patient’s family requests help, saying the patient suffers from fever and body pain, and the patient rests, when the teacher examines the pulse and finds it sinking and slow, he knows the condition is critical. How does he know this? The pulse of a person with an external illness should be floating and large; however, if the pulse is sinking and slow, it indicates improvement. For example, if the patient says their abdomen suddenly hurts while sitting, and the teacher examines the pulse to find it floating and large, he knows the condition is critical. How does he know this? The pulse of someone with an internal illness should be sinking and thin; if the pulse is floating and large, it indicates improvement. </p>
<p>The teacher said: When a family comes to ask, stating that the patient has extreme fever and agitation.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>Tomorrow, when the teacher arrives, the patient lies against the wall; the heat has already subsided. If the pulse is not harmonious, it is said that the patient has already recovered. If the patient lies against the wall, hears the teacher&#39;s arrival, and does not start up in surprise or look around, as if speaking in threes and pausing in threes, and if the pulse has trouble swallowing saliva, this is a feigned illness. If it is said that the pulse is naturally harmonious, it is described that your illness is too severe, and you must take expelling and purging medicines, along with acupuncture at several dozen or even a hundred points.</p>
<p>When the teacher takes the pulse, if the patient has a weak pulse, there is no illness; if the pulse is groaning, there is illness. A slow speech indicates wind; shaking the head while speaking indicates internal pain; if walking slowly, it indicates an exterior strength; if sitting and reclining, it indicates shortness of breath; if sitting and lowering one foot, it indicates waist pain; if the abdomen feels firm, as if protecting an egg, it indicates heart pain.</p>
<p>When asked: What is the state of the pulse for someone fearful due to illness? The teacher said: The pulse moves as if entwined in threads, and the complexion is pale and loses color. </p>
<p>For someone who does not drink, what is the state of their pulse? The teacher said: The pulse is naturally thin, and the lips and mouth are dry.</p>
<p>For someone who feels shame, what type of pulse do they have? The teacher said: The pulse is floating, and the complexion alternates between pale and red.</p>
<p>The pulse at the inch (cun) is weak and thin. The weak indication suggests the defensive qi is weak, and the thin indication suggests the nutritive qi is insufficient. If the defensive qi is weak, the complexion is yellow; if the nutritive qi is insufficient, the complexion is blue. The nutritive qi is the root, while the defensive qi is the leaf. If both the nutritive and defensive qi are weak, then the root and leaves wither, leading to chills and coughing, with the expectoration of foul-tasting phlegm and saliva. </p>

<p>Observing Cold and Heat, Inspecting Color<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>Those who are cold with rosy cheeks and talk excessively are under the influence of yin within yang. Those who are hot with a pale face and talk excessively are under the influence of yang within yin. Those who are cold with a pale face and talk excessively are under the influence of yin within yin. If one does not speak, they cannot be treated.</p>
<p>Regarding the five colors and pulse diagnosis:</p>
<p>A pale face with no right Guan pulse indicates a deficiency in the spleen, as wood overcomes earth. A red face with no right Cun pulse indicates a deficiency in the lungs, as fire overcomes metal. A white face with no left Guan pulse indicates a deficiency in the liver, as metal overcomes wood. A yellow face with no left Chi pulse indicates a deficiency in the kidneys, as earth overcomes water. A black face with no left Cun pulse indicates a deficiency in the heart, as water overcomes fire. Those with five deficiencies are destined to die. If the five deficiencies present at that moment, death is immediate; if not, death will occur within six months. If the five colors are seen but the five pulses are not, it indicates the person is not dead.</p>
<p>As for all humans, the organs and systems must maintain a harmonious balance of qi and blood throughout their lifetime to avoid illness. Any disruption will lead to disaster. When faced with illness, one must maintain a focused spirit, calming the breath, observing inwardly, avoiding reckless sight, and carefully discerning, in order to connect with the essence of the spirit, explore hidden details, and determine life from death with utmost accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Colors of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heart Verse:</strong> The color of the heart is red, seen as the color of a rooster&#39;s comb, auspicious if seen; ominous if the blood is stagnant and dark. (Note: The rooster&#39;s comb is red. Stagnant blood is red and black. Red is the primary color indicating harmony, while black signifies water overcoming fire, hence ominous.) (Tong Jinzi says: The heart&#39;s color is red, but the heart inside cannot be seen; thus, the saying, auspicious if the rooster&#39;s comb is seen, ominous if stagnant blood is seen. Shuhe states in the classics that each of the five organs is associated with five colors observable on the face, which should also correspond to the pulse at the radial artery. If the color is red, the pulse should be floating, large, and dispersed. Red is the color of the heart. Floating, large, and dispersed corresponds to the heart pulse. Thus, the colors of the five organs can all be observed on the face.)</p>
<p><strong>Liver Verse:</strong> The color of the liver is green; a bright green feather portends auspiciousness, while a face the color of withered grass indicates calamity. (Note: The liver is associated with the color green. Bright green feathers are blue mixed with red; withered grass is blue mixed with white. Red belongs to the heart&#39;s fire, while white belongs to the lung&#39;s metal. Wood generates fire, thus it is auspicious; metal overcomes wood, thus it indicates calamity.)</p>
<p><strong>Kidney Verse:</strong> The color of the kidneys is black; resembling soot is ominous.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: The color of the kidney is fundamentally black, resembling dark feathers, black with a hint of blue. Blue belongs to the liver and is associated with water nourishing wood, hence it is said to be auspicious. The color that resembles coal is black with a yellow tint. Yellow belongs to the earth, which overcomes water, hence it is said to be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Lung Praise</strong>: When pig lard congeals, it is auspicious, but a withered bone means life is difficult. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The lung is golden in color, white and shiny. White represents metal, and luster represents water; metal can generate water, thus it is said to be auspicious. The color of a withered bone is white but lacks luster. White is metal, and lack of luster indicates loss of internal moisture due to fire drying it out. Fire diminishes metal, thus it is said that life is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Praise</strong>: When there is phlegm it accumulates in winter, the skin turns yellow and the body feels dim.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The classics state that the accumulation in the spleen is termed phlegm, located in the stomach, covering a large area like a plate. If it does not heal for a long time, it causes the limbs to weaken, leads to jaundice, and affects digestion, resulting in a yellow and emaciated complexion. This is caused by the winter days of Ren and Gui. Why? Liver illness can affect the spleen, which should then convey to the kidneys. The kidneys are strong in the winter, and when strong, they do not accept evil. But the spleen still wants to send things back to the liver. The liver refuses to accept, thus it remains trapped as accumulation. Hence, it is known that phlegm accumulates in winter during the days of Ren and Gui.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br><strong>Observing Colors to Diagnose Illness and Life and Death Song</strong></p>
<p>To heal a sickness, if the eye corners are yellow and the eyelids suddenly sink, one can certainly know death is nearing. </p>
<p>[Note: The eye corresponds to the five organs and the five elements: the pupil is associated with the kidneys and the water element, the black part of the eye is related to the liver and the wind element, the upper and lower eyelids correspond to the spleen and the meat element, the white of the eye is linked to the lungs and the air element, and the corners of the eyes correspond to the heart and blood. Yellow corners indicate a fire element nourishing earth; when stomach qi begins to act, it suggests impending recovery. Sunken eyelids mean the vital qi of the five organs has ceased, indicating imminent death. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that sunken eyes indicate death. The solar pulse emerges from the eyes; if sunken, the solar energy has been exhausted, hence death. The solar energy governs all yang energies, thus it is specifically mentioned.]</p>
<p>If black appears in the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, entering indicates that ten die and seven cannot endure it.</p>
<p>[Note: Black is the color of the kidneys. Kidney illness saturates the organs, leading to blackness in the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. The tongue resides within the mouth and belongs to the heart&#39;s fire; if black from outside enters the mouth, water overwhelms fire, hence knowing that the probability is ten die without one surviving. The number of fire is seven, thus the seventh day is hard to endure.]</p>
<p>With a yellow face and blue eyes, drinking excessively often leads to chaos; malignant wind resides in the stomach, affecting the body.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Alcohol is a damp and hot substance; excessive drinking harms the spleen and stomach, resulting in a yellow complexion. When the spleen and stomach accumulate heat, it generates wind, hence the appearance of blue in the eyes. The whole body depends on the qi of the stomach for nourishment; if the wind pathogen remains in the stomach, it spreads throughout the body. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when there is illness with body heat and fatigue, sweating like a bath, and aversion to wind, what disease is this? Qi Bo says: &quot;It is wind caused by alcohol.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Black face and white eyes signify the failure of the life gate, extreme fatigue leads to death on the eighth day.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong> Black represents water. Eyes represent wood. White represents metal. The life gate signifies fire. Water&#39;s excessive infiltration harms the fire qi, and metal restrains wood, thus depleting the source of fire. Therefore, the fire of the life gate is diminished. The maximum amount of fire is seven; thus, it reaches its peak in seven days, leading to death on the eighth day.  </p>
<p><strong>A sudden change in complexion to green, appearing black, difficult to withstand in sudden death.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong> The blue-black color pertains to the liver and kidneys. The transition from green to black means failure in recovery; when the spirit departs, there is death.  </p>
<p><strong>Red face and white eyes indicate distressed breathing, and after ten days, life or death is determined.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong> Distressed breathing refers to panting or breathlessness.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>Red belongs to fire, and white belongs to metal. Fire conquering metal will inevitably cause panting and reversals. The number of metal is nine, while ten is the number of earth. Earth can give birth to metal; if it cannot, it will die, hence it is said to wait for ten days.</p>
<p>A red face and blue eyes are signs of widespread injury; when the channels of vitality and defense are obstructed, death will swiftly follow.</p>
<p>Yellow, black, and white colors appearing in the eyes, along with disasters in the mouth and nose, indicate misfortune. </p>
<p>If yellow, black, and white colors are mixed on the face, or enter the eyes, mouth, or nose, it signifies that sickness has penetrated from the outside inward, leading to calamities.</p>
<p>A blue face and yellow eyes at noon indicate imminent death; one must observe for another two days. </p>
<p>Noon is associated with fire; a blue face and yellow eyes suggest the liver (wood) overcoming the spleen (earth).<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>At noon, when wood does not fear fire, the power of wood becomes even stronger. People have their vitality based on the stomach; when the earth is cut off, they die, hence death occurs at this time. Other conflicts regard the thriving of thieves on the second day, determining life and death. </p>
<p>When the eyes lack luster and the gums are black, when the face is pale and the eyes are dark, it also signifies disaster. </p>
<p>[Note: The lack of luster in the eyes indicates weak spirit. Black gums suggest a deficiency in the spleen. A pale face indicates low blood levels. Dark eyes indicate kidney deficiency. If these four symptoms are present, it suggests one is not a long-term guest of life.]</p>
<p>When the mouth is like a fish’s, unable to close, and energy escapes without return, life is fleeting. </p>
<p>[Note: Fire overpowering the lungs leads to severe coughing and death, resulting in lung failure.]</p>
<p>With shallow breathing, the shoulders heave, gazing straight ahead, the lips are chapped, and the face swollen and dark, it is difficult to escape. </p>
<p>[Note: Shallow breathing indicates gasping and movement of the shoulders. Gazing straight means looking at things without blinking. Chapped lips indicate heat in the heart. The face reflects the heart&#39;s condition; a dark complexion indicates kidney issues. The first line points to heart failure, the second to liver failure. If both heart and liver fail, one’s life is hard to escape.]</p>
<p>Speaking recklessly or being mute, the smell of decay indicates a short lifespan. </p>
<p>[Note: This is due to the spirit being lost and unguarded.]<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>When the center of the mouth is filled and lips turn blue, one must know that their fate is doomed in three days. </p>
<p>When the cheeks and cheekbones are red and one has been ill for a long time, with a wide-open mouth and straightened breath, it is difficult for their life to continue. </p>
<p>When the toes are swollen and the knees are as large as a斗 (a traditional Chinese measure), one must know that it is hard to sustain life in ten days. </p>
<p>When the neck tendons are relaxed, it is certain that death is imminent; if there are no lines in the palms, life will not last long. </p>
<p>When the lips are blue, the body is cold, and there is involuntary urination, it indicates that death is approaching within four days after consuming food and drink.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>When one indulges in excessive eating and drinking, their spirit departs and does not protect them. The spirit and energy of a person originate from the liver; if the spirit does not protect it, the liver deteriorates, leading to death before reaching the age of fifty. </p>
<p>If the hands, feet, and nails are dark blue or black, recovery within eight days is quite difficult. (Note: The liver is associated with tendons, its quality is nails, and its color is blue. Black is linked to the kidneys; if both the liver and kidneys fail, water cannot nourish wood, hence the appearance of this color. Eight days is the measure of wood.)</p>
<p>If the spine aches and the waist feels heavy repeatedly, this indicates that the bones have deteriorated, and one should observe for five days. (Note: The spine pertains to the spleen, while the waist relates to the kidneys. The spleen is associated with earth and the kidneys with water; earth overcomes water, and death is anticipated within five days. Five represents the measure of earth.)</p>
<p>If the body is heavy and urine flows without stopping, and flesh deteriorates, expect death in six days. (Note: A heavy body that indicates flesh deterioration refers to the spleen; continuous urination indicates the kidneys. Earth conquers water, hence the death is expected in six days. Six represents the measure of water.)</p>
<p>If the hands and feet have dark blue nails and are prone to cursing, recovery is unlikely beyond nine days. (Note: The liver fails when it encounters metal, leading to death. Nine days represents the measure of metal.)</p>
<p>If the hair stands straight like hemp, one may die within half a day, and if one speaks or seeks clothing, death is certain within ten days. (Note: Hair standing like hemp indicates the cessation of lung qi. Speaking or seeking clothing signifies the spirit&#39;s inability to remain housed.)<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p>
<h3>Song of the Five Organs</h3>
<p><strong>Song of the Liver:</strong><br>If the face is swollen and blackish, and the tongue is rolled up in blue,<br>If the limbs are weak and the eyes seem blind;<br>Continuous weeping is a sign of the liver&#39;s demise,<br>On the eighth day, your life will surely decline.  </p>
<p><em>Note: &quot;Blue&quot; refers to the liver&#39;s color. The rolled tongue indicates that a child sees the mother&#39;s color. Weak limbs mean that the muscles can&#39;t support. When the liver can&#39;t contain blood to nourish the eyes, they appear blind. If fluids leak, weeping will not cease. All these symptoms arise from liver failure. Metal can conquer wood, hence death occurs on the day of Metal&#39;s reign. The eighth day is counted from the first day (Jia) to the eighth day (Xin). The classics state: when the foot&#39;s Jueyin energy is depleted, the muscles constrict, drawing the ovaries and rolling the tongue. Jueyin refers to the liver channel. The liver connects with the muscles. Muscles gather at the reproductive organs and are linked to the base of the tongue; therefore, if the pulse is not nourished, the muscles tighten. Tightened muscles draw on the ovaries and tongue. The rolled tongue and constricted ovaries signal that the muscles are failing first. On the day of Geng, there is worsening; on the day of Xin, death comes.</em><a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>Heart Song: The face darkened, shoulders straight, gazing intently; hands swollen, lacking markings; babbling frantically, the body in heat; within a day, to the underworld you go. </p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Darkened&quot; refers to a yellow-black color. &quot;Hands swollen, lacking markings&quot; indicates a cessation of heart energy. One denotes the elements of water, where water suppresses fire, thus death occurs within a day. The text states: if the Lesser Yin of the hand is severed, the pulse cannot flow; if the pulse does not flow, the blood cannot circulate; if the blood does not circulate, the complexion fades, hence the face turns dark like that of death. This blood dies first. A day of Ren brings seriousness, a day of Gui brings death.]</p>
<p>Spleen Song: The navel swollen, the face swollen yellow, diarrhea unnoticed, soiling the garments; the muscles coarse and stiff, including the reversed lips; within a day, twelve internal disasters loom. </p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Navel&quot; refers to the spirit&#39;s center. &quot;Swollen yellow&quot; refers to a yellow edema. The text states: if the Taiyin of the foot is severed, the pulse does not nourish the lips. The lips are the foundation of the muscles.]<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>When the pulse is not nourished, the muscles lack smoothness and luster. When the muscles lack smoothness and luster, the flesh becomes filled. When the flesh becomes filled, the lips become retracted, and when the lips retract, the flesh dies first. On the day of the first stroke, on the second day, death comes. </p>
<p>The song of the lungs says: Air from the mouth and nose flows out and does not return; the lips are retracted, dark and black like coal. The skin and fur become scorched and dry, claws withered and broken. Within three days, calamity is certain to know.</p>
<p>(Note: The air flowing out and not returning signifies exhalation without inhalation. The retraction of the lips means that earth cannot produce gold. Being black like coal means that gold cannot produce water. If air does not circulate, the skin and fur become scorched. If the soul and spirit are not connected, then the claws and nails wither and break. From the first stroke to the second, three days pass. The second corresponds to fire, and fire overcomes metal, hence death occurs in three days. The classics say: When the hand of the Taiyin is cut off, the skin and fur become scorched. The Taiyin refers to the lungs, which govern the flow of air and warmth to the skin and fur. When Qi does not nourish, the skin and fur become scorched; when the skin and fur are scorched, the fluids are lost; when the fluids are lost, the skin and fur wither and break. When the fur breaks, then the fur dies first.)<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>On a bing day, there is severity; on a ding day, there is death. The song of the kidneys states: &quot;If the face is dark and the teeth hurt, and the eyes are like those of the blind, with spontaneous sweating like water and frequent back pain; if the skin and flesh are moist and the hair lacks luster, then within four days, one’s life will surely not endure.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: A dark face resembles dirt; eyes like those of the blind imply dilated pupils. Spontaneous sweating like water indicates excessive heat. The waist is associated with the kidneys; if the kidneys fail, the waist feels as though it is broken. Without nourishment from the bone marrow, the bones and flesh cannot connect; when the flesh is moist but retreats, it cannot be the master of the five bodily fluids, which results in hair not being nourished. From jia to wu spans four days. Wu belongs to the earth, and earth overcomes water, hence life does not endure. The text states: If the foot&#39;s shaoyin energy is exhausted, then the bones wither. Shaoyin represents the winter pulse, operating silently while warming the bone marrow. Therefore, if the bone marrow is not warmed, the flesh will not adhere to the bones; if the bones and flesh do not unite, the flesh becomes moist but retreats; when the flesh is moist and retreats, the teeth elongate and become brittle. Lack of luster in the hair signifies that the bones have perished first. On a wu day, there is severity; on a ji day, there is death.)<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br><strong>Song of Birth Difficulty and Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>The body heavy, the warmth brings chill and pain,<br>Beneath the tongue, the pulse dark and green.<br>The tongue reversed is cold, and the child is often dead,<br>In the belly, the mother must return to the nether world.<br>Face red, tongue blue, look closely and observe,<br>If the mother lives and the child dies, it is certainly fated.<br>Both lips and mouth are blue, foam is produced repeatedly,<br>If both mother and child die, all is lost.<br>Face red, tongue blue, foam frequently emerges,<br>If the mother dies and the child lives, it is certain to know the truth.</p>

<p>It is stated: Sound corresponds to the five tones, color corresponds to the five elements. When sound and color match, then the health or decline of the organs is determined. If it nurtures, its energy thrives, as in the cases of green feathers, chicken combs, crab abdomens, pig fat, and black feathers. If it withers and dies, its energy deteriorates, as seen in grass, blood clots, bitter oranges, and withered bones, akin to the condition of decay. </p>
<p>Take for instance the appearance of blue and red in spring, red and yellow in summer, yellow and white in late summer, white and black in autumn, black and blue in winter. This is called the flourishing of the five organs, in accordance with the succession of the five elements. Observing the liver pulse presents colors of blue and white, the heart pulse shows red and black, the spleen pulse displays yellow and blue, the lung pulse reveals white and red, and the kidney pulse indicates black and yellow. This is what is meant by the true manifestation of the organs, in accordance with the mutual overcoming of the five elements.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>If there is wind in the lungs, the eyebrows are white; if there is wind in the heart, the mouth is red; if there is wind in the liver, the eyes are blue; if there is wind in the spleen, the nose is yellow; if there is wind in the kidneys, the skin is black; this is due to the wind traveling with various changes. If there is heat in the liver, the left cheek is red; if there is heat in the lungs, the right cheek is red; if there is heat in the heart, the face is red; if there is heat in the spleen, the nose is red; if there is heat in the kidneys, the jaw is red; this happens because all forms of heat belong to fire. Therefore, the blue-black signifies pain, yellow-red signifies heat, and blue-white signifies cold, as these are the results of the nine types of qi. A blue nose indicates abdominal water, black indicates water qi, white indicates lack of blood, yellow indicates chest cold, red indicates presence of wind, vivid reflections indicate retained fluids; thus, the five colors are determined by this. However, in examining patients, one must take the true spleen as the foundation. The true yellow of the spleen represents the heavenly qi. The five colors show clarity, and even if the illness is long-standing, a yellow face must develop, as it shows the manifestation of true qi. Although these points represent established methods, one cannot reach this understanding without a clear heart perceiving the obscurities. Hence, discerning the five colors with minute examinations and through the eyes is particularly difficult. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: to observe and know is called spirit. By seeing the five colors externally, one determines life and death.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br><strong>East Garden Ten Treatises</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, by Li Gao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Observation and Diagnosis</strong>  </p>
<p>When the disease manifests suddenly, if the disease&#39;s energy and spirit increase, it indicates an excess of pathogenic energy, meaning evil energy prevails. One should immediately purge it using cold, cool, sour, and bitter medicines. Conversely, if the disease manifests and the spirit becomes weak and exhausted, it indicates a deficiency of pathogenic energy, meaning true energy is lacking. In this case, one should urgently replenish it using warm, sweet, and spicy medicines. Regardless of whether the body&#39;s energy is in excess or deficient, one should only consider the excess or deficiency of pathogenic energy. For those with deficiency, replenish it; for those with excess, purge it. If pathogenic energy is in excess, one should urgently purge it with cooling medicines, as evil energy prevails. If pathogenic energy is insufficient, one should urgently replenish it with warm, sweet, and spicy medicines, indicating a lack of true energy. The body&#39;s energy refers to the breath that enters through the mouth and nose, while &quot;form&quot; refers to the skin, sinews, bones, and blood vessels. A robust body indicates excess, while a thinner body indicates deficiency. The energy refers specifically to the breath in the mouth and nose; if it is laboring as usual, that indicates an excess of energy. If there is wheezing, shortness of breath, or an inability to breathe, that indicates a deficiency. Hence, it is said: the body&#39;s energy is the energy and blood within a person&#39;s form.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>When there is a need to reinforce or to drain, it is not solely dependent on the situation but rather on the timing of the disease&#39;s manifestation. When the pathogen increases, it indicates that the evil energy is dominant, and there is an urgent need to drain it. If, during the onset, the spirit is weakened and speech is feeble or lazily spoken, it indicates insufficient vital energy, and there is an urgent need to reinforce it. If the patient has an insufficient constitution, and during the onset of the disease, the pathogen is also weak, this signifies that both yin and yang are deficient. Needling should be avoided, and it is advisable to reinforce with sweet medicines but not to exceed the dosage. Cauterization should not be abandoned. The point located five cun below the umbilicus is the Qi Sea point. </p>
<p>For qi disorders, drinking water is appropriate, while for blood disorders, one should not drink water. In cases of qi illness, there is numbness; in cases of blood illness, there is pain. If there is no yang, there is coldness; if there is no yin, there is vomiting. A yin condition shows a still body, muted speech, difficulty in breathing, eyes unable to see clearly, inability to exhale or inhale through the nose, coldness in the air of both mouth and nose, inability to take in fluids, uncontrollable bowel movements, accompanied with severe coldness, as if being cut by a knife. A yang condition manifests with bodily movement, audible light speech, clear eyes, normal breathing in and out through the nose, ability to take in air, and warmth in the air of both the mouth and nose.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br><strong>Facial Color Chart</strong></p>

<p><strong>Observe Color and Pulse to Determine Fortune</strong></p>
<p>Pulse is associated with the earth. Color is associated with the heavens. When earth gives birth to heaven, it is harmonious; when heaven gives birth to earth, it is discordant. For example, if one has a string pulse and the face is red, then earth gives birth to heaven. This indicates harmony, suggesting a swift recovery in a child supported by the mother. Conversely, if one has a string pulse and the face is black, then heaven gives birth to earth. This indicates discord, suggesting a slow recovery when the mother suppresses the child. Color represents the yang energy within yin and originates from heaven. Pulse represents the yin energy within yang and originates from the earth.</p>

One should be cautious.</p>
<p>For example, if the patient perceives both pleasant and unpleasant scents, the heart governs the five aromas, entering the spleen with those scents. Count from the east to the main condition; the main condition concerning the five aromas is the heart. One from the east and two from the south gives a count of two. Then, in dealing with the area of the illness, count backward. The spleen is one and the heart is two; thus, the original count is two. This leads you to the heart, which is the fire of the channel. You should drain the fire at the area of the illness, as it pertains to the spleen channel, where draining fire is common.</p>

<p>&quot;To harmonize color and pulse is to achieve complete health.</p>
<p>To understand the internal, one must observe the external; by diagnosing the external, one can know the internal. What exists internally must manifest externally. If one does not correlate the symptoms to determine the nature and sequence of the illness, it cannot be accomplished. A skilled practitioner thoroughly studies the principles, hence observes the five colors—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—corresponding to the pulses of the five organs, exploring their correlations and discrepancies. By feeling the five pulses—rapid, strong, slow, weak, or deep—one can align them with the colors of the five organs, and discern what is balanced and what is not. If one can truly perceive the subtle colors and diagnose the delicate pulses, treating based on the interplay of internal and external factors, then the greatest effectiveness can be achieved effortlessly. The <em>Suwen</em> states: &#39;By harmonizing color and pulse, one can achieve complete health.&#39; This is its meaning. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the principle of Dao manifests as the distinction between yin and yang, dispersing into the five elements, which all individuals possess. The five pulses are the truth of heaven, circulating blood and qi, connecting yin and yang to nourish the body. The five colors are the manifestations of qi, corresponding to the five elements, harmonizing with the four seasons, and displaying upon the face.&quot;<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>Only by carefully observing color and pulse without neglect can one discern the mechanisms of illness, diagnose based on cold and heat, relate it to the organs, and treat according to the symptoms to achieve complete recovery. For instance, if the liver&#39;s color appears a vibrant green and the pulse is slightly tense and rapid, it signifies vitality; but if it is floating, weak, and the color is like withered grass, can it generate life? If the heart&#39;s color resembles a red cockscomb, the pulse should be floating, large, and dispersed, indicating harmony; yet if it is heavy and slippery, with a color resembling stagnant blood, can it be harmonious? The spleen&#39;s color is like the yellow of a crab&#39;s belly, the pulse should be moderate, relaxed, and large, indicating compliance; if it is slightly tense and rapid, with a color like bitter fruit, can it comply? The lung&#39;s color is similar to white pig fat, the pulse should be floating, weak, and short, indicating good fortune; however, if it is floating, large, and dispersed, and the color resembles dry bone, can it be fortunate? Finally, if the kidney&#39;s color appears black like crow feathers, the pulse should be heavy, slippery, and relaxed, indicating life; but if the pulse is slow and large, and the color resembles charred material, it signifies death. The principles of life and death rely solely on the examination and observation.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>If this is the case, then there are no instances where the ailments do not heal when the corresponding remedies are applied. Furthermore, I have discussed this: the colors we see on the face correspond to specific parts, left and right, upper and lower; the pulse and breath also have their positions within the cun, guan, and chi. The left cheek corresponds to the liver, aligning with the left hand’s pulse for liver and gallbladder, associated with the element of wood and representing the initial qi. The face corresponds to the heart, aligning with the left hand’s cun for heart and small intestine, associated with the fire element and representing the second qi. The nose corresponds to the spleen, aligning with the right hand’s pulse for spleen and stomach, associated with the earth element and representing the fourth qi. The right cheek corresponds to the lungs, aligning with the right hand’s cun for lung and large intestine, associated with the metal element and representing the fifth qi. The jaw corresponds to the kidneys, aligning with the left hand’s chi for kidney and bladder, associated with the water element and representing the final qi. Furthermore, the fire of the heart corresponds to the third qi, relating to the right hand’s mingmen and the triple burner. As for the principles of yin and yang and the five elements, they should be integrated with color and pulse to derive conclusions.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>Therefore, the treatise on the subtlety of pulses states: colors correspond to the five elements, and pulses correspond to yin and yang. The Thirteen Difficulties says: the relationship between colors and pulses must be considered together. However, the comprehensive ability to heal diseases cannot be achieved if one does not align with both colors and pulses. The chapter on the generation of the five organs says: the heart corresponds to the pulse, and its color is its radiance. The qualities of pulse—thick, thin, slippery, rough, floating, sinking—can indicate differences. The subtle diagnosis of the five colors can be observed with the eyes. Following this with the ability to combine colors and pulses can lead to full healing. It is stated that the red pulse is prominent and hard, the white pulse is floating and restless, the green pulse is long and shifts left and right, the yellow pulse is large and weak, and the black pulse is hard and large at the top. First, the five colors are mentioned, then the five pulses, with the intention that future scholars understand and identify their connections. Later, Bian Que understood this distinctly and expressed: Knowing by observation is called spirit; knowing by feeling the pulse is called skill. This deeply grasps the principles of the Inner Canon. In subsequent generations, those who established methods called it: Spirit, skill, and comprehensive ability.

Those with fair complexions should not be overly dissipated, as this can exhaust their already weak vitality. Fair-complexioned individuals should refrain from drinking alcohol, as it depletes the blood.</p>
<p>In the treatment of illness, one must first observe the condition of the body and then examine the pulse and inquire about the symptoms. The classics say: The method of pulse diagnosis involves observing a person&#39;s courage and fears, their muscles and skin, to understand their condition for diagnosis. The shapes of people differ: long is not equal to short, large is not equal to small, and fat is not equal to thin. The coloring differs as well: white is not equal to black, tender is not equal to faded, thin is not equal to thick. Furthermore, the fat person tends to have excess moisture, and the thin person tends to have excess heat; the pale have weak lung qi, while the dark-skinned have sufficient kidney qi. Since shapes and colors are different, the organs are also distinct; even if the external symptoms are similar, the treatments must differ greatly. Thus, the pulse of a fat person is often floating, while that of a thin person is deep; an agitated individual may have a slow pulse, while a relaxed person may have a rapid pulse, indicating that one cannot adopt a uniform view. </p>
<p>For example, take Chen from Dongyang: he has prominent veins, his body is slightly elongated, and he suffers from exhaustion and labor, experiencing headaches to the point of speaking of life and death. Upon examining his pulse, I noted it was tense and large with multiple beats. I prescribed ginseng and white astragalus as the main ingredients, with safflower and dried tangerine peel as assistants. After five or six days with no improvement, everyone was astonished, thinking the medication was unsuitable. I said: The efficacy of the medicine follows a sequence; wait another one or two evenings, and things should stabilize. Suddenly, he returned that season asking why I hadn’t increased the astragalus. I smiled and did not answer.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>After another night, he suddenly mentioned that his illness was greatly improving. I checked his pulse and felt it was slightly stronger at the fingertips. After another half day, the patient said his diaphragm was full, and he was unaware of hunger; I noticed the lines on his abdomen had disappeared. I asked, &quot;Did you add astragalus to the medicine last night?&quot; He said yes. I gave him three doses, then quickly prescribed Erchen Decoction with added houpo, zhike, and huanglian to clear the excess. After three doses, he felt stable.</p>
<p>Then there was Chen from Yimen in Pujiang, over twenty years old, who developed a high fever in the autumn, felt thirsty, and had delusions—his illness seemed like the result of evil spirits. After seven or eight days, he called for me to treat him. Upon checking his pulse, I found both wrists strong, rapid, and full; he was plump, had a red face with a white hue, and wanted to expose his muscles. His pulse was inherently unsolid, due to cooling medicines. This was caused by overexertion leading to illness, and combined with warming tonics, he was restored. He said he had already taken seven or eight doses of Chaihu. I prescribed Huangqi and Fuzi Decoction, and gave him cold drinks. After three doses, he felt sleepy, snored, mildly perspired, and his pulse softened. I continued with Huangqi and Baizhu Decoction. By the tenth day, his pulse gradually became more contracted and smaller. After another half month, he was stable.</p>
<p>Huangqi is a tonic for qi. The two patients were either qi-deficient or qi-excessive, which requires careful consideration of what is appropriate; how can one not examine this?<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br><strong>Essence of Surgery</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Qi Dezhi】</p>
<p><strong>On the Method of Correlating Colors and Pulses of the Body</strong></p>
<p>The principles of heaven and earth are known as Yin and Yang, which in humans manifest as blood and Qi. Blood represents nourishment, while Qi represents defense. Nourishment circulates within, while defense operates externally; thus, nourishment flows through the pulses, and defense circulates outside them. The pulse is the precursor to blood and Qi; without the pulse, how can there be nourishment within? Without the pulse, how can there be defense outside? These two support and move together, internally connecting with the five organs and six bowels, and externally flowing to the nine orifices, four limbs, and countless joints and hair. Day and night, they circulate ceaselessly, forming a continuous loop, converging at the source pulse, where changes manifest in the pulse. Therefore, it is said: &quot;Qi and blood are the essence of a person; the pulse is the essence of Qi and blood.&quot; Hence, in the beginning of treating illness, one must establish the five determinations based on the five organs&#39; colors and pulses. The pulse responds internally, and the color responds externally; therefore, colors and pulses must correlate with one another. It is said: &quot;Those who can unify colors and pulses achieve completeness.&quot; Thus, any physician must first skillfully understand the interplay of colors and pulses. If one does not excel in this, even if they are intelligent and knowledgeable, they are still unworthy of trust.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br><strong>Medical Introduction</strong> (Ming, Li Zhan)</p>
<p><strong>Observing Forms and Colors</strong></p>
<p>Observing forms and colors is to treat diseases before they manifest. When the organs are not exhausted, the vital energy and blood are not disturbed, and the spirit is not scattered, the person can fully recover; if the disease has already developed, there is partial recovery; if the disease has progressed, the situation is critical. </p>
<p>Firstly, observe the person&#39;s spirit and complexion, their moisture or dryness, and their plumpness or thinness, as well as their sleeping patterns. (Note: A plump and pale person often has excess phlegm and dampness, while a thin and dark person often has heat and fire. Sometimes, a person may be plump and dark, or thin and pale. Make observations based on the situation at hand, considering either form or color, without being overly rigid.)</p>
<p>Lively and moist beings are real, while dry and thin ones are weak, a knowledge passed down through the ages. If there is a deficiency in the body, one will likely feel lower back pain; knitting the brows indicates head pain and dizziness. Inability to lift one&#39;s hands signals shoulder and back pain, while difficulty walking suggests foot pain. Pressing the chest with crossed arms shows chest pain, and pressing the navel indicates connected abdominal pain. </p>
<p>Difficulty sleeping can accompany phlegm mixed with heat; excessive sleep may result from vacuity and coldness. Wall-sitting with a curled body suggests coldness, while lying flat and relaxed indicates heat. A yellow complexion indicates spleen dampness and heat, while bluish lips and a dark face reflect the same previous condition.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br><strong>The Essential Principles of Correspondence Among Form, Color, and Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If a healthy person shows a floating, tight, and dry pulse akin to that of a febrile disease, though they have no headache, fever, or chills, they will soon fall ill and may die; this is called a &quot;walking corpse.&quot; Similarly, if someone exhibits frequent movements followed by a long halt, they may die within a year, even if they appear healthy. </p>
<p>For a patient with a strong pulse but a frail appearance, lacking spirit, suffering from spontaneous sweating and loss of appetite, with persistent diarrhea, these are signs of exhaustion. If their pulse remains strong despite their condition, they too may die. </p>
<p>When color and pulse correspond and the illness resolves, no treatment is needed. If the pulse contradicts the color and indicates a victorious interaction, the person will die; if it indicates a nourishing interaction, the illness will resolve on its own. Seasonal evils manifest in various forms, where evils from the past are considered real, and those that appear later are seen as unreal. For instance, in cases of red complexion associated with heat, phlegm-fire, mania, or rashes, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered. In cases of a greenish hue linked to liver issues, such as flank pain, dry heaving, or blood in the stool, the pulse should be taut and rapid.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>The yellow hue indicates conditions of the spleen related to damp-heat, swelling, food injury, vomiting, diarrhea, and obstruction, and the pulse should be moderate and large. The white hue indicates lung conditions such as asthma, phlegm-fluid retention, weakness, and cough, and the pulse should be floating, thready, and short. The black hue indicates kidney conditions like lumbago, leg pain, hernia, turbidity in urination, and nocturnal emission, and the pulse should be deep, soft, and slippery. If there is excess activity, it corresponds to deficiency and heat; if there is stillness, it corresponds to cold and fullness, which should be consistent with the pulse. Additionally, for the five accumulations and six collections, careful observation of color and pulse evidence is especially necessary. Thus, red pulse corresponds to white pulse when discussing color-pulse relations. Moreover, the five colors align with the five organs, with green representing the interplay of yin and yang governing pathways.</p>
<p>Fat individuals have thick flesh and thus have a deep and firm pulse; thin individuals have less flesh and thus have a floating and long pulse. Short individuals should have a short and rapid pulse; tall individuals should have a spacious and long pulse. Discrepancies and oppositions that lack harmony lead to death. It is not only the physical shape that needs to correspond; even if the skin appears slippery, thready, wide, or tight, it should align with the pulse as well. The classics state that a pulse of a certain number of beats corresponds to skin of the same condition: a rapid pulse relates to fast skin, a hurried pulse relates to hasty skin, a slow pulse relates to relaxed skin, a thready pulse relates to thready skin, and a slippery pulse relates to slippery skin.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>Medical Principles: Six Essentials<br>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi)</p>
<p><strong>Observation Method</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, the legendary physician Xuan Qi, out of compassion for the suffering of the people, sought hidden truths, traced origins, and laid down methods to benefit future generations. He established the four diagnostic methods of observation, listening, inquiry, and palpation, to determine the yin and yang, surface and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess, life and death, fortune and misfortune. Nowadays, people rely solely on pulse diagnosis to prescribe medicine; how can this be without error? Moreover, in wealthy households, women stay behind curtains and cover their arms with silk, lacking the ability to be observed for their complexion and heard for their voice, and they cannot fully utilize the art of pulse examination, nor engage in thorough inquiry. Patients often dislike the complexity of the process, considering it overly tedious, resulting in some not taking their prescribed medicine. Testing the doctor with one&#39;s illness and testing the medicine with one&#39;s life lead the physician to undervalue human life, recklessly employing arbitrary discussion—does this not lead to mutual loss? In essence, a physician must guard life. If discerning and meticulous observation and treatment are not employed, and principles are harmed, this is not the approach of a humane person. From the &quot;Suwen&quot; and &quot;Lingshu&quot; onwards, all works of wisdom through the ages contain pieces of knowledge that can be foundational for the four diagnostic methods. If future practitioners are willing to delve deeply and appreciate this work, they will understand pulse diagnosis with the clarity reminiscent of ice. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;By observation, one understands it, perceiving its five colors to know the illness.&quot;<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>The liver is signified by the color blue, the lungs by white, the heart by red, the kidneys by black, and the spleen by yellow. When one is ill, the complexion must change and this will be evident on the face. The lungs govern qi; if qi is deficient, the complexion turns white. The kidneys belong to water; if water is depleted, the face becomes dark. Blue indicates anger that harms the liver, while red signifies fiery excess in the heart. Yellow suggests internal damage to the spleen and stomach; purple and muddy imply external invasion of evil pathogens. If one is haggard and dark, it indicates profound melancholy and deep-seated emotional distress; if thin and pale, it results from prolonged illness and bodily weakness. A bright root of the nose indicates a desire for recovery; a dark ring around the mouth suggests a critical kidney condition. </p>
<p>Indeed, internal conditions manifest externally; observing the surface reveals the inner state. Examining the features of the brows and eyes reveals the condition of the lungs and liver. When the six hollow organs are obstructed, the feet grow cold and shrink. When the five internal organs suffer from obstruction, there is unrestrained discharge leading to numbness in the limbs. Heart disease that affects the lungs may lead to death; typically, one first experiences heart pain followed by coughing. Liver ailments affecting the spleen can also be fatal; usually, this begins with pain in the sides and results in swelling and diarrhea. Spleen ailments affecting the kidneys may lead to death; this often starts with diarrhea and follows with dysentery. Kidney afflictions affecting the heart can be deadly; it typically begins with pain in the lower back followed by heart distress and related symptoms. Lung ailments affecting the liver can be fatal; it usually begins with coughing and follows with pain in the sides, and the pulse is string-like and thin.</p>
<p>The human body fundamentally consists of form, and what fills that form is qi. When form surpasses qi, there is premature death; this is marked by being plump and pale. When qi surpasses form, there is longevity; those who are slender, dark, lean, and spirited exemplify this. A surplus of form indicates excess, along with the presence of harmful qi. Emaciation suggests deficiency, indicating weakness in the righteous qi.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br><strong>Certificate of Death</strong></p>

<p><strong>Observation, Listening, Inquiry, and Palpation</strong>  </p>
<p>The four terms: Observation, Listening, Inquiry, and Palpation, truly represent the essence of medicine. If one grasps the significance of these four words, they can be considered profound in the field of medicine. Contemporary practitioners often focus solely on Inquiry, with only a superficial understanding of Observation and Listening. As for Palpation, it is viewed as the least important among the three, leading to a scarcity of those skilled in it. Even when mentioned, it typically revolves around concepts of the heart, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, and kidneys. Without distinguishing these positions, how can one discern the nuances of deficiency and excess, life and death? Little do they realize that the key lies in the effectiveness of Palpation. The first three—Observation, Listening, and Inquiry—serve to uncover the beginning of the illness, which is then confirmed through Palpation at the pulse, enabling one to ascertain the source of the illness, its current location in any organ or channel, whether it is deficient or excessive, whether it leads to death or survival. The careful analysis of treatment must rely on Palpation, thus ensuring effective treatment plans can be devised. This order of practice—first approaching the patient, observing, then listening, followed by inquiry, and ultimately Palpation—reflects a logic that is not easily accomplished. Can we therefore dismiss the importance of Palpation? I record this to provide guidance for those in the know.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>The blue color appears in the areas of the moon and sun, as well as on the fish tail, the face, and the corners of the mouth. When it resembles the appearance of dark blue leaves, it indicates a complete deficiency of liver energy, signifying death. However, if it resembles the color of emerald feathers or the bark of the cypress tree, it only signifies liver pathogens, related to conditions like shock, wind disorders, or eye illnesses.</p>
<p>The red color is seen on the lips and in the three yin and three yang regions above and below. If it appears like the color of a horse&#39;s liver or dark blood, it indicates a complete deficiency of heart energy, signifying death. In contrast, if it appears as the orange-red color of a horse&#39;s tail, it only signifies heart issues, such as palpitations, anxiety, and restlessness at night.</p>
<p>The white color can be observed at the tip of the nose and on the face itself, resembling dried bones or faded sweat powder. This indicates a complete deficiency of lung energy, leading to imminent death. If it resembles the thick, powdery whiteness of plum blossoms, it only signifies lung pathogens causing coughing, and might bring worries about filial piety.</p>
<p>The yellow color can be observed on the nose, appearing dry and resembling an earthen figurine, which indicates a complete deficiency of spleen energy, signifying death. However, if it appears as the color of osmanthus with dark shades, it merely signifies spleen disorders, causing discomfort in eating, fatigue in the limbs, and concerns about wives and concubines.</p>
<p>The black color is seen in the ears or around their contours, resembling a suspended wall. If it resembles the appearance of dirty water or coal, it indicates a complete deficiency of kidney energy, signifying death. Conversely, if it appears as the dark sheen of spider webs or black feathers, it merely signifies kidney deficiency, with fire attacking water-related ailments.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Basic Guidelines for Observing Color</strong></p>
<p>When diagnosing febrile illnesses, one must first observe the color. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: sounds correspond to the five tones, colors correspond to the five elements; when the sounds and colors match, one can understand the diseases of the five organs. The liver’s color is green, and its sound is a call; the lung’s color is white, and its sound is weeping; the heart’s color is red, and its sound is laughter; the spleen’s color is yellow, and its sound is singing; the kidney’s color is black, and its sound is groaning. Furthermore, the colors of the four seasons are beneficial when they support each other, but adverse when they conflict. For example, green and red appear in spring, red and yellow in summer, yellow and white in late summer, white and black in autumn, and black and green in winter; these are the harmonious colors. However, if the liver disease presents as green and white, heart disease as red and black, spleen disease as yellow and green, lung disease as white and red, and kidney disease as black and yellow, these conflicts among the five elements signify difficulties in treatment.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>In terms of the heat of the five internal organs, the colors seen on the face are as follows: if there is liver heat, the left cheek turns red first; if there is lung heat, the right cheek turns red first; if there is heart heat, the complexion turns red first; if there is spleen heat, the nose turns red first; if there is kidney heat, the jaw turns red first. As for a dark face, it indicates coldness; a blue face indicates wind-cold; blue and black indicate wind, cold, and pain; yellow and white suggest dampness, heat, and disharmony of qi; blue and white indicate wind, qi stagnation, cold, and pain. Generally speaking, if dark qi appears on the face, it often signifies severe illness; if dark qi appears bright and moist, it indicates life, while if it is dark and dry, it indicates death. This is a brief overview of the key points. The &quot;Neijing&quot; utilizes the five colors for subtle diagnosis that can be observed visually. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that to observe and understand is called insight. Therefore, color must not be neglected. In examining for exogenous cold, one must first observe the pulse and color, then palpate the pulse and carefully assess the evidence to decide matters of life and death, good and bad fortune.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br>Colors include blue, yellow, red, white, and black, which can be seen on the skin of the face; the Qi appears as tangled threads and chaotic hair, hidden beneath the skin. The five internal organs correspond to five colors, and the six channels correspond to six colors, all manifesting on the face in relation to the five elements. Things that nourish and promote are auspicious, while those that conflict and weaken are inauspicious. Those that thrive are alive, while those that wither and perish are dead. In the areas of the forehead, life expectancy, destiny, commanding lines, and the philtrum, there are signs of Qi; a complexion that is nourished and bright is auspicious, while one that is dark and dry is inauspicious. Furthermore, one should understand the principles of growth and decline through the four seasons. Here, I will briefly outline the key signs of a cold attack related to the five colors on the left for easy reference. Blue belongs to wood, signifies wind, cold, and pain, and is the color of the liver channel (Foot Jueyin). If the face and lips are blue, it indicates extreme yin. If the tongue is rolled and the throat is constricted, it is advisable to warm urgently. If it is a case of cold attacking with Yin involvement, leading to lower abdominal pain, the face will also appear blue.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>The Inner Canon states: Those with a blue color like green feathers are alive; those with a blue color like thriving grass are dead. Those who are blue but black or blue but red are alive; those that are blue and white but dry are in conflict and thus die. Spleen diseases manifest with blue qi, which is often difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Red is associated with fire, representing heat; it is the color of the hand’s Shaoyin Heart. In cases of cold, there are distinctions between three Yang and one Yin. The foot’s Taiyang is associated with water, appearing black when cold and red when hot. It is said that when the facial complexion is bright red, it indicates Yang qi stagnation on the surface and that sweating has not occurred, so it should be induced. If the pulse is floating and rapid, showing surface heat, and there is no sweating, the face appears red and radiant. It is stated that when a Yangming disease has a red complexion, it should not be attacked directly. The term &quot;coalesce&quot; implies communication; this means that surface pathogens remain unresolved and should not be attacked internally. However, if Yangming is internally full, with an aversion to heat but not to cold, or if there are steaming heat or afternoon tidal heat, with constipation and a red face accompanied by delirium, this indicates true internal heat and may be attacked.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br>If both the interior and exterior are hot, with dryness of the mouth and throat, drinking water, a surging pulse, and a red face, but the interior is not firm, one should not yet use purgatives but may prepare a decoction of Ginseng and Baihu (White Tiger) to harmonize. In cases of Shaoyang syndrome, where heat is between the exterior and interior, with a red face and wiry pulse, one should use Xiaochaihu Decoction to harmonize, and do not purgative. The classics say in Shaoyin syndrome, diarrhea of clear grains occurs, with internal cold and external heat, and a red face; thus, use Si Ni Decoction with scallions as the primary treatment. This represents extreme internal yin cold, pushing the floating fire upward to the face, resulting in redness, which is not heat. If one does not examine carefully and mistakenly administers cold cooling agents, it may lead to death; one must be cautious! Furthermore, if there&#39;s a combination of yin injury and cold with floating yang conditions, the face can also appear red, but if the feet are cold and the pulse is deep, this indicates restlessness. A red face with cold feet and a deep pulse where one cannot drink water indicates extreme yin, and warmth is needed. In cases of prolonged illness in weak individuals, with redness on both cheeks and the cheekbones during the afternoon, this indicates yin fire; one should not treat it as cold damage.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br>The influences of the three Yang energies converge at the forehead. The pathway from the forehead to the crown, connecting to the back of the brain, is the Taiyang; from the forehead to below the nose on the face is the Yangming; and from the temples down to the ears, in front and behind, is the Shaoyang. If there is red energy or redness and swelling, distinguish by this. Indeed, in cases of severe head cold, it is necessary to understand this aspect. The &quot;Internal Classics&quot; states: When there is heat in the heart, the face turns red first; when there is heat in the spleen, the nose turns red first; when there is heat in the liver, the left cheek turns red first; when there is heat in the lungs, the right cheek turns red first; when there is heat in the kidneys, the jaw turns red first. If it is red and then turns blue, or red and then yellow, it represents generation, and it is auspicious. If it is red and then black, it represents conflict, and it is unfortunate. The classics say that a red complexion like a chicken&#39;s comb is life, while one resembling blood is death. Indeed, if the forehead and Yintang show withered red energy, it indicates death; if they are bright and moist, it indicates life. If red energy shows in lung disease, it is difficult to treat. Yellow belongs to the earth element, governs moisture, and is the color of the foot Taiyin spleen meridian.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br>Yellow that is bright like an orange indicates heat; yellow that is dark and smoky indicates dampness. Generally, yellow mixed with white or red signifies good fortune, but yellow mixed with green that conflicts signifies misfortune. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Yellow like a crab&#39;s belly indicates life, while yellow like a bitter orange indicates death. If the forehead, lifespan, and impressions show bright and moist yellow, the illness recedes and good fortune appears; if it is dry and withered, it indicates death. For a disease to recover, the eyes showing a yellow hue is a good sign; seeing yellow and white in late summer is auspicious, but yellow and green are ominous.</p>
<p>White belongs to the lungs and metal, indicating insufficient vital energy and blood; it is the color of the hand Taiyin lung meridian. If liver disease presents with this color, it is difficult to treat. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: White like pig fat signifies life, while white like dry bones signifies death. Generally, a white and withered forehead or lifespan indicates misfortune, while a white and radiant appearance signifies good fortune. If the white is paired with black or yellow and mutually supportive, it is auspicious; but if it is paired with red, indicating conflict, it forebodes misfortune.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>If a person suffering from a cold has a pale and lifeless face, it may be due to excessive sweating or blood loss. The color black relates to water, represents cold and pain, and is the color of the kidney&#39;s lesser yin. Generally, black paired with white or black with blue is considered auspicious; however, if black appears with yellow, it indicates conflict and thus is inauspicious. The Inner Canon states: those with black resembling raven feathers shall live, while those with black like soot shall die. If the forehead, life palace, and the area between the eyebrows are dark, it indicates an early death; conversely, if the black has brightness and moisture, it signifies life. If black energy from the tail of the fish connects to the greater yin, it signifies death. Black energy entering from the nasolabial folds or the philtrum signifies life. If the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose are dark and lifeless, it indicates death. Generally, if the face, forehead, and life palace are bright and moist, it signifies life, while if they are dry and dark, it indicates death. If heart disease is accompanied by black energy in the head, it signifies death. Hua Tuo said: if a patient&#39;s facial color is uniform, it is auspicious; if not, it is inauspicious. For example, if the face is green with white eyes, red with blue eyes, yellow with blue eyes, red with white eyes, white with black eyes, black with white eyes, or white with blue eyes, these are all considered uneven, thus indicating inauspiciousness. Uniformity refers to faces that are uniformly green or uniformly red.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br><strong>Observation of the Eyes</strong></p>
<p>When the eyes are bright and can see, they can be treated; if they are dim and cannot recognize people, or if they gaze upwards, or glare straight ahead, or if the pupils are perfectly round, or if the eyes are squinting, or if the eyelids are sunken, these conditions cannot be treated. Generally, if one opens their eyes and wishes to see others, it indicates a yang condition; if one closes their eyes and does not wish to see others, it indicates a yin condition. If vision is unclear and the eyes are not balanced, it signifies excessive internal heat. Pain in the eyes relates to the heat of yangming. Red eyes also indicate excessive heat. If the eyes are shut, there will surely be bleeding. If the whites of the eyes are yellow, the body will likely turn yellow as well. If a sickness wishes to heal, the corner of the eyes will be yellow, the tip of the nose will be bright, and the bridge of the nose will be clear.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a></p>
<h3>Observations on the Nose</h3>
<p>If the tip of the nose is blue, it indicates abdominal pain; if it is cold, the person will die. A slightly dark color suggests water retention, while a yellow hue indicates difficulty in urination. A white nose represents qi deficiency; a red nose indicates lung heat. A bright color suggests the presence of retained fluids. If the nostrils are dry, it corresponds to heat in the yangming channel and is likely to result in bleeding. If the nostrils are dry and black like coal, it indicates deep yang toxicity. If the nostrils are cold, slippery, and black, it signifies extreme cold toxicity. If one snores during sleep, it suggests wind warmth. Nasal obstruction with turbid mucus indicates wind heat. If the nostrils are flared, it indicates lung wind, where the lungs are severely affected and cannot recover.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Lips</h3>
<p>Generally, dry and scorched lips indicate heat in the spleen. Scorched but red lips are a good sign; scorched and black lips are ominous. If both the lips and mouth are red and swollen, it indicates severe heat. If both are blue-black, it signifies extreme cold. A bitter taste in the mouth corresponds to heat in the gallbladder. A sweet taste indicates heat in the spleen. If the mouth is dry and the throat parched, it suggests kidney heat. If the tongue is dry and the mouth is thirsty, it indicates heat in the yangming channel. If one cannot speak at all, it indicates spasm from wind. If there are sores on the upper lip, it indicates that a fox parasite is consuming its organs; if there are sores on the lower lip, it suggests that a pestilential worm is consuming the anus. If the lips are cyanotic, the tongue is curled, the lips are bluish and inverted, the surrounding mouth is dark, the mouth is widely open with rapid breathing, the lips tremble and shake continuously, and the breath does not return, these conditions are all incurable.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a></p>
<h3>Examination of the Ear</h3>
<p>Generally, if the ear lobes are red and moist, the individual is alive; if they are yellow, white, black, or greenish and dry, the individual is dead. A thin, white, or thin, black ear lobe indicates kidney failure. Any deafness or pain in the ear belongs to the lesser yang heat, which is treatable; however, if there is deafness with a curled tongue and blue lips, it pertains to the extreme yin, which is difficult to treat.</p>
<h3>Examination of the Tongue</h3>
<p>A bright red tongue is auspicious. A blue tongue indicates cold. A blue and purple tongue signifies yin and cold. A red and purple tongue signifies yang and heat. A black tongue indicates excessive conditions and is difficult to treat. A white and slippery coating on the tongue shows surface cold. Additionally, heat in the lower abdomen and cold in the chest are indicated. A yellow and dry tongue indicates excessive heat, while a black and dry tongue indicates severe heat and extremes. If the tongue is neither dry nor thirsty but has a black and slippery coating, it suggests cold and yin. A curled and scorched tongue, black and dry, indicates extreme yang toxicity. A blue tongue with a slippery coating indicates extreme yin toxicity. Any swelling, dryness, cracks, or prickly projections on the tongue indicates severe heat. If the tongue is whip-like, stiff, or short with chaotic energy and unclear speech, it indicates death. Furthermore, if the tongue can be extended several inches, it suggests death. The tongue is a key to the heart and is associated with fire; a red color is auspicious, while black indicates that water overcomes fire, making it difficult to treat.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a></p>
<h3>Observation of the Body</h3>
<p>For any patient whose body is light and can easily turn, treatment is straightforward; however, if the body is heavy and cannot turn, treatment is difficult. It is known that with yin conditions, the body is heavy, and the feet are cold, leading to a curled-up position. Such individuals tend to lie against a wall, close their eyes, and dislike bright light, preferring to avoid seeing others. Additionally, a yin toxicity manifests as pain in the body like being struck, feeling heavy as if under a mountain, and unable to turn.</p>
<p>When influenced by dampness or wind, the body often feels heavy and painful, resulting in an inability to move side to side; it is essential to differentiate these conditions. Generally, in yang conditions, the body feels light, the hands and feet are warm, and the eyes are open with a desire to see others, indicating a chance for treatment. If the head feels heavy and vision is obscured, it suggests a disturbance of the heavenly pillar bone and the depletion of vital energy.</p>
<p>In cases of epidemic diseases, when feeling the clothes or touching the bed results in grasping air with two hands, this indicates the spirit has departed and the soul is in chaos. Generally, for patients with moist and supple skin, there is hope for recovery; for those with dry skin, the prognosis is poor. The classics state: if the pulse is floating and surging, the body sweats profusely like oil, there is incessant wheezing, and the body feels numb—sometimes calm and sometimes agitated—this signals imminent death. </p>
<p>— From &quot;Medical Canon and Law&quot; by Yu Chang, Qing Dynasty<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br><strong>On Observing Colors</strong></p>
<p>Among the five organs and numerous bones of a person, the spirit resides in the ears. Color is the banner of the spirit. When the spirit is strong, the color is vibrant; when the spirit is weak, the color fades; when the spirit is hidden, the color dims; when the spirit is exposed, the color shines. The color of emperors is marked with dragon patterns and phoenix hues. The color of immortals reflects the brilliance of mountain greens. The glory of wealth shines like pearls and the luster of jade. The color of longevity and old age resembles the ancient cypress and the deep green of pines. Even the colors of poverty and early demise are heavy, murky, and stifled, lacking vitality and appearing dull and dark; all these reveal themselves on the face.</p>
<p>For illnesses arising from within, how should their visible colors be interpreted? The “Inner Canon” emphasizes the importance of observing the face in discerning colors. Yellow on the face with various eye colors—be it green, red, white, or black—indicates survival; however, blue faces with red eyes, red faces with white eyes, blue faces with black eyes, black faces with white eyes, and red faces with green eyes all indicate death. This is because yellow represents the central hue of the earth; if a patient’s face displays yellow, unhindered by other colors, it is auspicious. A face lacking yellow but instead tainted by other colors suggests misfortune. Although the color yellow in the eyes, regardless of its depth and warmth, should not be hastily judged regarding life and death. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the colors reflecting the virtues and vices of the five organs reveal themselves on the face, distributed among the forehead, cheeks, nose, and jaw. The “Needling Heat” chapter states that for those with liver heat, the left cheek becomes red first; for heart heat, the forehead turns red first; for spleen heat, the nose reddens first; for lung heat, the right cheek shows redness first; and for kidney heat, the jaw reddens first. Even if the illness has not yet erupted, redness should be needled, which is referred to as treating illness before it manifests. Thus, the colors indicating the conditions of the five organs observed on the face warrant careful examination, not only concerning heat-related illnesses.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>However, there is further insight, namely the brightness of the eyes and the brilliance of the nose. The classic states that the five colors of brightness represent the essence of qi. These five colors manifest above the essence of the five organs, changing among the brightness; certain colors signify good, while others signify evil, allowing for foresight. The colors seen on the face correspond to their respective positions—above, below, left, and right—each with its significance. Thus, the brilliance around the nose provides a means to discern these colors&#39; oppositions, as well as those of the genders, making it crucial. The subtleties of color observation are unparalleled.</p>
<p>Zhongjing further proposed a profound principle, with the key being the central nasal bridge, which serves as the celestial cornerstone and the earthly central peak. The pathological energies of the four organs—wood, metal, water, and fire—must converge upon the central soil. For instance, when the tip of the nose appears blue, and there is internal suffering of cold pain in the abdomen, it denotes death. This remark stands out through the ages; later generations lament the absence of “On Sudden Illness,” unable to trace its origins, unaware that this statement captures its essence.</p>
<p>The blue color of the liver&#39;s wood within the Ying Yin corresponds with the coldness of the kidney&#39;s water; it manifests at the nose and reflects in the abdomen, resulting in sudden illness leading to death. A slightly darkened tip of the nose indicates the presence of water energy, interlinking with the previous statement. Although black signifies the yin of the kidneys, a slight darkness without abdominal pain indicates water energy rather than sudden illness. A yellow hue denotes coldness in the chest, where “cold” often implies phlegm within the context of “Treatise on Cold Damage,” suggesting accumulation of phlegm in the chest. A white hue indicates loss of blood; white is associated with the lungs, which govern the upper jiao, and when the vital flow is insufficient, the nose becomes pale, indicating blood loss.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>It is said that if one sees a faint red that is not in season, it indicates death; the color of fire returns to the earth. Why hastily conclude death? However, if there is an abnormal qi not in its proper time, then the fire is not the fire that nourishes the soil, but rather the fire that overcomes metal, leading to internal dryness and consequently death. </p>
<p>Next, regarding the observation of the eyes, it is stated that if the pupils are perfectly round, it signifies that paralysis cannot be treated. Following this, we examine the five facial colors: a blue color indicates pain; a black color indicates labor; a red color indicates wind; a yellow color indicates constipation; a bright color indicates retention of fluids. Furthermore, a yellow color indicates coldness in the chest. </p>
<p>Each observation corresponds with the &quot;Neijing,&quot; supplementing what is lacking, and thus it may be used as a method and transmitted. </p>
<p>The good colors are: blue like emerald feathers, red like a rooster&#39;s comb, yellow like a crab&#39;s belly, white like pig fat, and black like crow feathers. The bad colors are: blue like grass, red like magenta blood, yellow like bitter oranges, black like soot, and white like dry bones. The five organs show good colors when they possess essence and vitality; when devoid of it, the color is adverse. Initially, one does not take blue and black as major taboos. </p>
<p>If one sees a bad color before illness, illness is bound to be severe. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that red appearing on both cheekbones, as large as a thumb, signifies that even a minor illness will inevitably lead to death. Black appearing at the forehead, also as large as a thumb, indicates certain death without any prior illness. The meaning correlates with the facial colors appearing in the upper, lower, left, and right regions of the ming tang (the space between the eyebrows), and this is indeed a sign of a sudden illness.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>For those who have been sick for a long time, their appearance will show signs of their illness: in lung heat disease, the complexion is pale and the hair becomes brittle; in heart heat disease, the complexion is red and the veins are prominent; in liver heat disease, the complexion is dark and the nails become brittle; in spleen heat disease, the complexion is yellow and the flesh moves irregularly; in kidney heat disease, the complexion is black and the teeth become brittle. The manifestation of disease in one&#39;s color can be seen by ordinary practitioners, yet hoping to revive the dry and withered on days of no benefit is akin to multiplying efforts without result when compared to treating those who are not yet ill. Moreover, one may observe the color of someone who has long been ailing, and mistakenly think they are sick, leading the unskilled to be dazzled and suspicious, unaware that the color of the veins is not to be feared. The color of the yin channels remains constant according to their respective meridians, while changes in color are characteristic of the yang channels. Excess cold results in a blue-black hue; excess heat results in a yellow-red hue.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all these are without illness; why then are they regarded with surprise? However, there is a method for observing colors, which has its transmission. Qibo says that if the condition arises from the heart, it appears as white wrapped around red; if from the lungs, as white wrapped around bright red; if from the liver, as white wrapped around dark blue; if from the spleen, as white wrapped around gourd fruit; and if from the kidneys, as white wrapped around purple. White is fine silk, layered upon red, bright red, dark blue, yellow, and purple; the inner colors shine through to the outside, appearing both hidden and visible. The complexion reflects what is within the flesh; how can it be different from this? Thus, the subtleties of observing colors are entirely based on observing the spirit. Blood nourishes qi, and qi nourishes the spirit; when illness occurs, these aspects become intertwined. A person who loses sleep shows a hungry spirit; a child who has lost a parent shows a dull spirit, as their qi is no longer nourished by the spirit. When a child develops smallpox, an intense inner fire is in motion, and the eyes first show a crystalline light without waiting for the pox to develop. A strong dose of water is used to counter the sunlight, allowing the toxic fire to emerge in a thin line, preventing it from spreading wildly and avoiding disaster. Such insights are rarely recorded throughout history, hence the intention to document them.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>To diagnose an illness without understanding the importance of observing color is like a boatman unfamiliar with the winds and currents, liable to face capsizing and drowning. This negligence indicates the faults of the physician.</p>
<p>The method of analyzing color and pulse is of utmost importance, as entrusted by the sages, serving as the authority in treating ailments. Color is what the eyes perceive, and pulse is what the hands hold; when combined, they go beyond mere sight and touch, fundamentally relying on the spiritual heart. The Inner Canon states that ancient practitioners skillfully assessed the color and pulse to connect with divine insights, harmonizing with the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—along with the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, always adhering to the constant principles. Thus, the significance of color and pulse can discern divine signs, linking the interplay of the elements and seasons, while the variations of winds and patterns do not stray from their regular cycles. This allows for predictions of changes in health, not to mention the mechanisms of illness in the human body. It further explains that the shifts in color correspond with the pulses of the four seasons—this is what the divine deems precious for connecting with spiritual clarity.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br>Therefore, to be far from death and close to life is the transformation of color between the essence and clarity. This aligns with the pulses of the four seasons, distinguishing good from bad, as one has already grasped the signs of life and death. Thus, one can remain constantly far from death and close to life. Is it not worthy of great value to stay this way? As for the skilled diagnostician, they observe the color and feel the pulse, first distinguishing yin and yang, examining clarity and turbidity to comprehend the parts. They look at the breathing and listen to the voice to understand the source of suffering, observing the balance and proportions, measuring dimensions, and scrutinizing the rise and fall, smoothness, and complexity to ascertain the origin of the illness. This is derived from the interplay of color and pulse to engage with observation, breath, and sound, seeking the origin of the illness in the heights and depths, both inside and outside. It is indeed subtle and refined! It cannot merely be the path of the average person; hence there are distinctions among the superior, middle, and inferior practitioners. The superior practitioner achieves perfection nine out of ten times, the middle practitioner seven out of ten, and the inferior practitioner six out of ten.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said that a skilled tuner of the measuring stick does not rely on inches; a skilled pulse reader does not depend on color, for there is a distinction between the root and branches. Yet, one must be able to combine these three and practice them simultaneously, achieving mastery in both the fundamental and the peripheral aspects. How do they integrate? The colors associated with the five organs seen in the seasons are: Spring is blue, Summer is red, Late Summer is yellow, Autumn is white, and Winter is black. The external manifestations corresponding to the five organs are: White corresponds to the lungs and skin, Red corresponds to the heart and blood vessels, Yellow corresponds to the spleen and muscles, Blue corresponds to the liver and tendons, and Black corresponds to the kidneys and bones. The pulses of the five organs are: Spring is springy, Summer is hooked, Autumn is downy, and Winter is stony. Strong pulses indicate excess, while weak pulses indicate deficiency. In each season, if the stomach is balanced it indicates health; if the stomach is diminished it indicates illness, and if there is no stomach it indicates death. If there is a stomach but shows the pulse of defeat, the condition may be severe or, if mild, it may lead to illness at the time of defeat.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br>Integrating the colors of the pulse and reflecting upon them, is this not something clear and easy to follow? Zhongjing also introduced a convenient method, stating that the motion of the pulse at the inch is dependent on its appropriate time. For instance, if the liver’s color is green but appears white, then at that time, all visible pulse colors indicate illness. The pulses of both hands belong to the Taiyin channels, collectively called the inch pulse, and when they are active according to their appropriate time, the liver&#39;s dominant color should be green, with the pulse reflecting a subtle tension. If it appears white instead, it indicates a superficial pulse, and if it fails to endure during its critical time, it leads to demise. Only when the natural dominant color of the pulse is green and tense can one align with the rightful spring season. Moreover, any appearance of a white superficial pulse is a sign of malevolent forces, as are the colors red, yellow, or black, indicating that these pulses should be treated as illness, though with distinctions of severity. The Classic of Internal Medicine has detailed these principles, and Zhongjing further measured them with the golden needle. Is it possible for scholars to remain unclear about this?<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>In treating diseases, if one does not correctly analyze the colors and pulses, and confuses the findings, gaining one aspect while losing another, achieving partial understanding while neglecting the whole, one is merely a mediocre practitioner. When faced with a case, if clarity is lacking and the practitioner does not possess skill and judgment, the fault lies with the physician.</p>
<p>In treating diseases, if one fails to observe the four easy and difficult principles, it is a mistake.</p>
<p>In general treatment, one must combine observation of color, pulse, and careful examination. The easy and difficult aspects are as clear as a palm&#39;s lines. A rough practitioner does not differentiate between the easy and the difficult and may even perceive ease where there is difficulty; this is the fault of the physician. Observing the physical condition, energy, color, pulse, the old and new states of the illness, and timing for treatment, when the physical condition and energy are in harmony, this is deemed treatable. A bright and moist color indicates ease in treatment. The pulse reflecting the four seasons indicates treatability. A weak yet slippery pulse signifies a balanced stomach qi and is called easy to treat. When energy and form are in harmony, it is treatable. Color and energy that are bright and nourished signify ease in treatment. The pulse should follow the four seasons; thus, it is treatable. A weak yet slippery pulse, with a suitable stomach qi, signifies ease. </p>
<p>When the physical condition and energy are discordant, it is deemed difficult to treat. A color that is pale and lacks moisture is called difficult. A firm and solid pulse signals a serious condition. A pulse that contradicts the four seasons is unmanageable. One must carefully investigate the four difficulties and make clear declarations. When the form and energy do not complement each other, with pale and withered color lacking clarity, alongside a firm pulse without stomach qi, and a pulse deviating from seasonal norms, these four conditions are not treatable. Due to their difficulty, one must make this clear. A mediocre practitioner&#39;s easy cases have often gone unchecked.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br>The treatment of illnesses without recognizing the distinctions between new and old conditions</p>
<p>In treating illnesses, if one fails to discern the nature of new and old diseases, whether chronic or acute, and loses the correct order in urgency, the responsibilities fall upon the physician. When the pulse is small and does not diminish in color, it indicates a new illness. This suggests that the vital energy is weak, yet the spirit remains strong. When the pulse diminishes in color, it indicates a chronic illness. In this case, although the spirit may persist, the pathogenic influence overwhelms the righteous energies. When the pulse and all five colors are both diminished, this signifies a chronic illness. In such a scenario, both spirit and energy are weakened. Conversely, when the pulse and five colors are not diminished, it points to a new illness, indicating that both spirit and energy are robust. New illnesses should be treated urgently, while chronic illnesses should be addressed more cautiously. </p>
<p>If the internal organs have already deteriorated, their color will inevitably appear decrepit, and this will ultimately lead to death. Indeed, color reflects the spirit, while the organs serve as its residence. When the spirit departs, the organs deteriorate. When the organs deteriorate, their color displays decrepitude and aversion.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a><br><strong>Maxims of the Ancients</strong></p>
<p>Fat people have more dampness, while thin people have more heat. Those with more dampness have loose tissue, making it easier for external pathogens to invade; those with more heat have tight tissue, making it harder for external pathogens to intrude. Excess dampness leads to internal relaxation with less harm; excess heat leads to internal dryness, which is prone to internal injury.<br>— <em>Complete Works of Jingyue</em> by Zhang Jiebin, Ming Dynasty  </p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Pulse Colors of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The color of the pulse reflects the state of blood and qi. If the form is correct, the reflection is correct; if the form is crooked, the reflection is crooked. Disease originates internally, thus the pulse color will inevitably reveal itself externally. Therefore, when examining a patient, one must first clarify the pulse color. However, the way of pulse color cannot be fully expressed in mere words; to grasp its essence, it relies on the four aspects of yin, yang, deficiency, and excess. If there is no distinction among the four, all is well. In general, a pulse that is surging and smooth is considered solid and yang, while a weak pulse is considered deficient and yin. This does not need further explanation. However, Zhongjing states that if the pulse is floating and large, then qi is solid and blood is deficient. Tao Jiemian states that regardless of whether the pulse is floating, sinking, large, or small, if there is no strength detectable under pressure, and heavy pressing yields none, it is indicative of a yin condition. The <em>Inner Canon</em> defines a pulse that is four times larger as a crucial sign of true deficiency; thus, a slippery and large pulse is not necessarily yang.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br>The distinction of form and color dictates that red and yellow signify true heat, while blue and black indicate Yin cold. However, Zhongjing stated: a face that is red and bright signifies insufficient Yin; hence, red and bright does not necessarily equate to being true. In summary, when seeking the pulse, one must discern Yin and Yang through strength or weakness, and assess whether there is spirit or not to discern reality from emptiness. A gentle pulse indicates the arrival of vital energy, while a strong and harsh pulse signals the approach of evil energy. When illness reaches a critical stage, one must observe the ebb and flow of vital energy and the advance and retreat of evils; the relationship between life and death depends entirely on this. This principle is extremely subtle and is not easily understood, so I will outline its essentials. To diagnose illness, one must not only understand the cause but also observe the pulse, color, and sound, analyzing them together to ascertain the truth of emptiness and fullness, Yin and Yang. Failing to grasp one while acquiring another leads to confusion between what is true and what is false, which is the most egregious error for a physician; thus, it must not be neglected!<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br><strong>On the Discussion of Life and Death Based on Spirit</strong></p>
<p>Diagnosing illness based on physical appearance: if the eyes shine brilliantly, speech is clear, thoughts are stable, muscles are firm, and breath is calm with normal bowel movements, then although there may be questionable pulse indicators, there is no need for great concern, as the spirit remains within the body. However, if the eyebrows are dark and the eyes confused, the body is emaciated and the complexion poor, there is abnormal rapid breathing, and persistent diarrhea; or if there is significant loss of flesh throughout the body; or if the hands reach for clothes and search for the bed; or if one speaks nonsensically; or perceives phantoms without being sick; or if the abdomen is distended with no treatment possible for both supplementation and purging; or if there are symptoms of cold and heat that cannot be addressed with warmth or coolness; or if a sudden severe illness leads to confusion and restlessness, causing one to not recognize others; or if one suddenly collapses, with eyes closed and mouth open, and involuntary urination occurs; in such cases, even if pulse readings do not indicate danger, death is certain, as the spirit has departed from the body.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a></p>
<h3>Theory of Pre-Heaven and Post-Heaven</h3>
<p>Life is born on earth, and destiny hangs by heaven; this is how humanity is guided by heaven. Those who nurture will cultivate, and those who topple will overturn; this is how heaven governs humanity. Heaven is fundamentally unified, yet viewed in this manner, there is the &quot;heaven of heaven,&quot; which refers to the heaven that gives life to us, born from the void and derived from heaven. There is also the &quot;heaven of humanity,&quot; which refers to the heaven that shapes us, formed from existence and grounded in ourselves. The act of being born is prior, and the act of being shaped is subsequent, thus the meanings of pre-heaven and post-heaven are revealed here. </p>
<p>Therefore, speaking of human endowments, those endowed pre-heavenly strong and robust tend to live longer, while those weak in pre-heaven are more prone to early death. Those who are cultivated post-heaven live longer still, while those who are diminished post-heaven face even earlier demise. </p>
<p>As for bones, they are pre-heaven; muscles are post-heaven. The spirit is also pre-heaven; appearance is post-heaven. In terms of coloration, those who are pale tend to live long, while those who are tender are more likely to perish early. Among the tender, those with some pallor are fortunate; among the pale, those with some tenderness are unfortunate. </p>
<p>In terms of sound, fullness brings longevity, while timidity leads to early death. Although slender and long sounds are unlucky, although loud and abrupt sounds are also unlucky. Differentiating physical forms, sturdiness leads to longevity, while fragility results in early demise. A body may be thin and weak yet capable of endurance is fortunate, while a body may be strong yet easily fatigued is unfortunate.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br>Movement and stillness have their distinctions; stillness leads to longevity, while restlessness results in premature death. Although nature may appear urgent, those who find harmony within urgency will be fortunate. Though the Yang seems thick, those who contain subtlety within thickness face misfortune. </p>
<p>Regarding the distinction of youth and age, the young may seem weak at first, but gradual growth leads to strength—this is the mark of later accomplishments. When assessing temperament, the youthful and flashy are easily filled; this is a sign of early decline. Thus, those who encompass both heaven and earth surely enjoy longevity. Those who lose their principles in both early and late phases will experience short lives without foreknowledge.</p>
<p>If we speak of human agency, the strength from nature should not be relied upon recklessly; doing so will only lead to its loss. The naturally weaker should exercise caution; with caution, one can overcome destiny. Caution means guarding one’s emotions to protect the mind, being mindful of seasonal changes to safeguard lung energy, being restrained with indulgences to protect the liver and kidneys, and avoiding excessive labor and food to preserve the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Only joy can nurture life; those who desire happiness should strive for goodness. Only blessings can ensure existence; those who seek blessings must not deceive the divine. As long as there is no internal loss, how can afflictions invade? And is not the power of heaven and earth within our grasp? Therefore, &quot;Guangchengzi&quot; says: Do not exhaust your body, do not agitate your essence; then one can attain longevity. How profound this is! The essence of these words is complete. Do not take this lightly and ignore it!<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br><strong>On Observing Colors</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;To observe and know is called spirit.&quot; Therefore, observing colors is the primary principle in treating people. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; text states: The five colors correspond to the five organs: green for the liver, red for the heart, white for the lungs, yellow for the spleen, and black for the kidneys. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: The qi of the five organs manifests in color; if it appears green like grass, it indicates death; yellow like bitter orange indicates death; black like soot indicates death; red like fresh blood indicates death; and white like withered bones indicates death. These are the signs of death in the five colors. If it appears green like emerald feathers, it indicates life; red like a rooster&#39;s comb indicates life; yellow like a crab&#39;s abdomen indicates life; white like pig fat indicates life; and black like crow&#39;s feathers indicates life. These are the signs of life in the five colors. </p>
<p>Life manifests in the heart as if wrapped in white cloth over red; in the lungs as if wrapped in white cloth over red; in the liver as if wrapped in white cloth over blue; in the spleen as if wrapped in white cloth over gourd; and in the kidneys as if wrapped in white cloth over purple. These are the external manifestations of the five organs. The &quot;Neijing&quot; divides colors into three categories of health, sickness, and death. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; further divides the internal organs into distinct sections, with methodologies that address the surface level and depth, as well as vitality and dispersion, signifying the importance of this principle. I briefly outline its essence: The five colors possess brightness; they shine brilliantly. The five colors have substance; they are moist and lustrous.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br>Light is formless and represents Yang, which governs Qi; the body has form and represents Yin, which governs blood. When both Qi and blood are depleted, their colors become dark, dull, and withered. This is exemplified by the five conditions known as grass, bitter orange, roasted blood, dry bones, and bones that are shriveled. If Qi and blood still exist, their colors are bright and moist, represented by the five conditions of green feathers, cockscomb, crab abdomen, pig fat, and black feathers. Although these five colors can still be generated, they ultimately correspond to an excessive color of one organ, which leads to harm and illness, not balance.</p>
<p>A healthy person with harmonious organs will have the color of one organ that awaits its dominant one, beginning to flourish outwardly. This outward flourishing is nourished by stomach Qi, appearing in the skin and fur. The color of stomach Qi is yellow, while the color of the skin and fur is white, hence it is said to resemble being wrapped in white cloth. A white cloth wraps is hazy with luminosity; although there is shape and shadow, it is not yet radiant, stemming from the harmony of Qi and blood, the absence of conflict between Yin and Yang, and the balance among the five organs.</p>
<p>If not, should the five organs decline, the previously hazy color changes to an excessive one; the previously bright color turns to murkiness; the previously moist color becomes withered. Eventually, murkiness and withering combine, resulting in destruction. Should there be no light within, and Qi and blood of Yin and Yang be completely severed, one cannot hope to survive!<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a><br><strong>On Color and Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>To treat illness, it is essential to observe color, which requires examining the face, with each part having its significance. The two eyebrows on the face correspond to the lungs; if they appear red, it indicates fire; if blue, wind; if yellow, dampness; if black, pain; and if white, coldness. The area between the eyes, known as the &quot;ming tang,&quot; corresponds to the heart. Below the ming tang, at the nose, corresponds to the liver, with the sides of the liver representing the gallbladder. The tip of the nose corresponds to the spleen, while the sides of the nose correspond to the stomach. The area above the cheeks corresponds to the kidneys, while above the kidneys corresponds to the large intestine. The liver and gallbladder correspond to the sides of the nose and the small intestine. The area above the lungs corresponds to the forehead, which relates to the throat. The forehead corresponds to the head and face, and the area beside the heart relates to the &quot;dan zhong.&quot; Below the nose at the &quot;ren zhong&quot; corresponds to the bladder, while the &quot;san jiao&quot; has no specific location: the upper jiao resides in the lungs, the middle jiao in the liver, and the lower jiao in the bladder. Other locations correspond precisely to the &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; The five colors correspond to their respective organs and can be evaluated to diagnose illness, similar to the method used to diagnose lung conditions, all being remarkably effective. However, there are interactions of generation and overcoming: for instance, if blue appears with yellow, wood overcomes earth; if red appears with black, water overcomes fire. If yellow appears with red, fire generates earth; and if black appears with white, metal generates water.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>Those who conquer die, and those who live continue to live. The method of treatment is as follows: the conqueror saves their life, while the living control their conqueror. Otherwise, the illness cannot be quickly resolved. There are those who manifest internally and those who manifest externally. The internally manifesting ones wish to resolve but do not wish to hide; the externally manifesting ones desire to deepen but do not wish to disperse. The ones that wish to resolve indicate a light illness, while those that wish to deepen indicate a severe illness. The method of treatment is to assist the resolving ones with their uprightness and to drive away the deep ones with their evil; otherwise, the illness cannot swiftly decline. But how do we differentiate between internal and external? The colors that are dark and turbid belong to the internal, while those that are light and lustrous belong to the external. Once the five colors appear in specific locations, one must carefully observe their heaviness or lightness to understand the depth of the illness; one must closely examine whether they are dry or moist to perceive the life or death of the illness; one must meticulously distinguish between gathering and dispersing to know the close or distant nature of the illness; one must attentively observe the up and down to discern the nature of the organs involved in the illness. The most subtle aspect is in observing whether the five colors possess spirit or lack spirit. A dark color with spirit can still sustain life even in severe illness; a bright color lacking spirit can lead to death even without illness. But how do we discern the presence or absence of spirit? This is determined by the yellow and brightness of the color. If the color is yellow and has shine, hidden beneath the skin and hair, even if the distinction among colors is visible, there is no worry. This method of observing spirit is something one must know!<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br><strong>Outside Diagnosis Method: [Hearing]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Classic of Difficulties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse</strong></p>
<p>When the internal organs are full and the qi is abundant, but the person is fearful, their voice sounds as if it comes from within a room; this is the dampness of the middle qi. [Note: The kidneys are the water organ, receiving and storing the essence of the five organs. If the kidneys do not store, then the internal organs will be overfilled. Fear pertains to the will of the kidneys; if the kidneys do not store but instead exceed their limits, they will harm their will. When qi is abundant and harms fear, the essence will also leak outward; hence it is called the dampness of the middle qi. The voice sounding as if from within a room means the sound is not loud, and the voice does not project outward.]</p>
<p>When one speaks in a faint voice and repeats words throughout the day, this drains the qi. [Note: Faint refers to the sound and breath being frail. Repeating words all day long indicates a lack of continuity in the qi. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: in reality, it is delirious speech, in emptiness, it is the Zheng voice. Zheng voice refers to heavy speech.]</p>
<p>When clothing does not gather, and speech does not distinguish between good and evil, nor avoids relatives and non-relatives, this is a disturbance of the spirit. [Note: The spirit refers to the vital energy of the five organs. Speech not distinguishing good and evil, nor avoiding relatives, indicates a disordered spirit resulting in delirious speech.]<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Fullness and Emptiness of Vitality</strong></p>
<p>The flavor of salt is salty, and its essence causes fluids in the body to leak out. When a string is about to break, it produces a harsh and disappointing sound; when wood has buds, its leaves appear. When the wood is withering, its leaves fall. All of these are said to not be in harmony with the divinity. When a sickness is profound, the voice is wheezy. If one experiences these three signs, it is termed as the obstruction of the internal organs, a situation where poisonous substances cannot be remedied, and where short needles cannot take effect. All these conditions lead to surface wounds damaging the flesh, with blood and energy becoming stagnant and dark.</p>
<p>[Note: The salty flavor of salt is inherently moistening; when placed in a vessel, its essence rises and causes fluids to leak over the vessel. Similarly, when a string is about to snap, its sound must first become harsh. When the energy of wood disperses, its leaves emerge early. All three of these conditions correlate to the wheeziness stemming from internal damage, which manifests in sound. The symptoms of wheeziness can arise from three causes: one is when the lung qi rebels and wishes to come up from the stomach; the prescription is tangerine peel and bamboo shavings soup, which addresses the rebellious symptom; another cause is when wheezing occurs alongside abdominal fullness, requiring an examination of the areas before and after to understand where the obstruction lies, leading to resolution, which is the substantial symptom; lastly, if one experiences all three signs and wheezes, it is a sign of deterioration. This is due to a deep-seated sickness that has already damaged the stomach and intestines; even poisonous substances cannot remedy the interior, and short needles cannot address the exterior, resulting in a scorched surface, wounded muscles, and stagnation of energy and blood leading to decay. &quot;Black&quot; indicates a color of corruption.]<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Theory of Reality and Illusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Understanding Diseases by the Sounds of the Five Tones</strong></p>
<p>The sixty-first difficulty states: Recognizing the illness involves hearing the five tones to differentiate the diseases.<br>[Note: Each of the five organs produces a sound correlated with a specific tone. The liver&#39;s sound is a call, corresponding to the &quot;jiao&quot; tone, when adjusted becomes straightforward. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;jiao&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the liver. The heart&#39;s sound is laughter, corresponding to the &quot;zheng&quot; tone, harmonious and prolonged. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;zheng&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the heart. The spleen&#39;s sound is song, corresponding to the &quot;gong&quot; tone, vast and harmonious. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;gong&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the spleen. The lung&#39;s sound is crying, corresponding to the &quot;shang&quot; tone, light and strong. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;shang&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the lung. The kidney&#39;s sound is groaning, corresponding to the &quot;yu&quot; tone, deep and profound. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;yu&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the kidney. Yuan said: Listening to the sounds of the five organs and the five tones to discern their purity and muddiness, or their competing sounds, helps identify their illness.]<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br><strong>On the Essentials of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han – Zhang Ji)</p>

<p>The teacher said: If the breath is slightly frequent, the illness is in the middle jiao; if there is fullness, it can be alleviated immediately; if there is deficiency, it cannot be treated. In the upper jiao, the breath is short; in the lower jiao, it is distant. All of these are difficult to treat. If breathing is irregular and tremulous, it is untreatable.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Canon</strong> (Han – Hua Tuo)</p>
<p><strong>Hearing Voice to Determine Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>A person who speaks falsely or is unable to speak is dying; hot diseases lead to death. If the five organs are externally and internally severed, and the spirit cannot be contained, a hoarse voice denotes death. If both yin and yang are closed, and there is a loss of voice, this indicates death.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br><strong>Differentiating Between Excess and Deficiency of Qi</strong></p>
<p>When external injuries are caused by wind and cold, the qi becomes obstructed and abundant; when internal injuries arise from food intake and labor, the respiration through the mouth and nose is short and insufficient. How can this be distinguished? Those who are afflicted by wind and cold initially do not have any decrease in heart and lung&#39;s original qi, yet the presence of evil qi exacerbates the condition, leading to nasal blockage and poor flow, causing the face to redden and obstructing the nasal qi from exiting, which then comes out through the mouth. When such a person speaks, their words tend to be light at the beginning and heavy at the end. Their voice is strong, loud, and vigorous. In the case of febrile illness, the nose is dry and non-secreting, the face is red and congested, and the speech is light at the start and heavy at the end, with a strong and loud voice, indicating an excess condition. In a case of a cold, there will be a clear nasal discharge, a hoarse voice, and speech that sounds as if it is coming from a jar, also exhibiting lightness at the beginning and heaviness at the end, high and strong, again indicating excess. In contrast, those with internal injuries from food intake and labor suffer an initial loss of qi in their heart and lungs, resulting from heat injury. Once the heat harms the qi, the limbs become weak and unable to move, thus causing short and insufficient breaths from the mouth and nose, leading to fatigue and a tendency to speak little. When questioned, they often do not wish to respond at all; even if they force themselves to answer, their energy is weak and their voice low, indicating a deficiency of qi. With such clarity, even women and girls can discern these conditions. How could physicians be unable to differentiate them?<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br><strong>The Six Essentials of Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>Voice Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: By hearing the five sounds, one understands the illness. Each of the five organs corresponds to one of the five sounds: the liver corresponds to the “jiao,” the heart to the “zheng,” the spleen to the “gong,” the lungs to the “shang,” and the kidneys to the “yu.” However, this meaning is profound and not easily approximated by the ordinary. Now, I will gather the ancient and modern experiences and simplified methods to the left and name it &quot;Voice Diagnosis.&quot;</p>
<p>The groan of the pulse indicates pain, referring to groaning during diagnosis. A slow voice indicates wind, which is akin to today’s wind diseases. A voice that sounds as if it is coming from inside a room indicates dampness in the qi. If the speech is faint and only resumes after a long pause, this indicates a loss of qi, where the qi is weak and not connecting properly, leading to interruptions in speech. If clothing is not properly gathered and speech is filled with insults, disregarding relationships, this indicates disruption of the spirit, akin to manic wind. A lazy and timid manner of speaking, first light then heavy, reflects internal injury due to insufficient original qi.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>When speaking loudly and forcefully, starting with emphasis and then becoming light, it indicates a strong external pathogenic factor. Frowning and groaning signifies pain in the head. Yelling while pressing one&#39;s heart indicates pain in the center of the abdomen. Groaning and being unable to turn over suggests back pain. Shaking one’s head while touching the jaw indicates pain in the lips and teeth. Groaning and being unable to rise suggests pain in the waist and legs. Slowness in movement indicates pain in the waist and legs. If a patient sighs during examination, it suggests stagnation. Shaking the head while speaking indicates internal pain. Sudden hoarseness can result from wind, phlegm, or excessive anger. Sitting and being short of breath suggests phlegm-heat asthma. Stammering or unclear speech suggests wind-phlegm. Middle-aged individuals with a hoarse voice indicate phlegm-heat. If a patient speaks to themselves during examination, with disorganized thoughts, it results from mental strain. In cases of severe cold damage leading to hoarseness due to emotional disturbance, ulcers on the upper lip mean parasitic infection of the internal organs; ulcers on the lower lip indicate infestation in the anal region. If a person is short of breath and cannot take a full breath, they are severely deficient. A person without cold or heat, but who is short of breath, indicates an excess condition, likely due to phlegm-heat.</p>
<p>Listening to voices helps discern fortunes and misfortunes.</p>
<p>A hoarse, pale voice and long-lasting illness indicate trouble. If someone has been ill for a long time and is short of breath, it is a danger. A frail figure with a hoarse voice suggests chronic illness or tuberculosis, with lung ulcerations in the throat. Conversely, if someone remains loud despite being ill, it signifies fortune.</p>
<p>Medical Introduction by Li Zhan, Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Listening and examining voices distinguishes diseases.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br>Second, listen to the distinction between clear and turbid sounds, and discern between true words and wild talk. Turbid sounds are like phlegm clogging, while clear sounds have their source in coldness within. Genuine speech is not merely hot, while wild words and shouting represent deep and firm heat. Speaking of deities and spirits transcends walls and roofs; a blockage in the chest shows signs of dizziness. Moreover, there are ailments that linger over time; a sudden loss of voice can lead to death.</p>
<p>[The five sounds correspond to the five organs: metal sounds are clear, earth sounds are turbid, wood sounds are long, water sounds are clear, and fire sounds are dry. A clear sound indicates smooth lung qi. A sound that comes from a room signifies dampness. If speech is faint and resumes only after a long day, it signifies a depletion of qi. A sound that is light then heavy, high-pitched and forceful is due to external influences. A sound that is heavy then light, sluggish and weak indicates internal injury.]</p>
<p>From the medical canon, discussions on sound:</p>
<p>Movement indicates a change in one’s usual state. With the slightest sound, differentiate the five organs and their changes, seeking the good and bad of diseases. While the principles are not without detail, the essence of governing one’s body lies significantly in qi and spirit. The classic states that when the center is ample and the organs are full, excessive qi leads to potentially harmful conditions; sound that seems to come from a room indicates internal dampness. The faintness of speech indicates qi emerging from the throat and tongue to the mouth. New patients and those with minor illnesses maintain their voice, but only those with prolonged or severe illnesses will see a change in their voice. Once the voice changes, the disease manifests and can no longer be evaded; it is thus something that can be heard and known. The classic says: to hear and know is called spirit.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>What cultivation leads to such a state? The ancients, upon hearing the lamentations from beyond a wall, did not see the form but first understood the emotion. If one cultivates with sincere effort over time, it becomes as if a blind person hears with precision; could it not be said that the heart does not separate from the eyes? However, one must refer to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; to seek transformations of the heart, thus beginning to be called a divine ear. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; categorizes the five tones of Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, and Yu, as well as the five sounds of laughter, singing, crying, moaning, and groaning, to examine the internal and external states of the five organs and the evils of the five energies. It describes the liver&#39;s wood represented by the tone Jue and the sound call; its transformation is grip. The heart&#39;s fire represented by the tone Zhi and the sound laughter; its transformation is worry. The spleen&#39;s earth represented by the tone Gong and the sound songs; its transformation is eructation. The lung&#39;s metal represented by the tone Shang and the sound crying; its transformation is cough. The kidney&#39;s water represented by the tone Yu and the sound moaning; its transformation is what we might call a loss of energy.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>It is said that when speech is evaluated as good or bad, without regard for familiarity or distance, this is a confusion of the divine and the bright. One can discern changes in spirit through sound, which is even more profound. The &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; also associates the sound of a patient&#39;s voice with their condition: if a patient speaks in a quiet and subdued manner, expressing delight or surprise, it indicates an ailment in the joints; if the voice is hoarse and unclear, it suggests a problem in the heart and diaphragm; if the voice is shrill, thin, and prolonged, it signifies an issue in the head. These three types of speech reflect illnesses in the lower, middle, and upper burners, each with its own discernible changes. The subtle meanings are revealed from heaven, easily understood even through a mere partition. A subdued voice indicates a desire to remain silent rather than to speak out. Quietude and concealment correspond to the three yin, which are connected to the jueyin (the terminal yin). How do we know this? Jueyin is associated with surprise in intention and with calling in sound; the illness is fundamentally silent yet includes moments of surprise and calling, thus we come to understand this.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>When it comes to the Yin aspect, the illness must penetrate deeply into the lower regions, affecting the bones and the spaces between the sinews and joints. If sounds emit softly and are not fully expressed, it indicates a failure to resonate. When the great qi in the chest does not circulate, the mechanisms of inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling become difficult and delayed, indicating that the illness is within the middle jiao, between the chest and diaphragm. If the sounds are sharp and prolonged, they arise from the Yin division of the lower regions and ascend, correlated with the Taiyang channel governing qi and in connection with the Shaoyin, hence the kidney evil does not reach the neck but returns; it should progress through the Taiyang section to reach the summit. The sound of the kidneys is normally a groan, but now, as the kidney qi assaults directly upward along the Taiyang meridians, the groan transforms, becoming a sharp, prolonged sound, representing an illness in the head. This passage by Zhang Zhongjing expands the theory, emphasizing the importance of listening to sounds and discerning illnesses, so the writings cannot fully convey everything; scholars should seek out the endless treasures within themselves.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>In general, if one hears sounds and cannot distinguish between laughter, singing, crying, or moaning to discern the good and bad of the five organs, and the ailments influenced by the five evils and the spirit, it is a failure in medical practice. If one hears sounds but cannot differentiate between male and female, or long and short, or which part of the three divisions it comes from, it is also a failure in medical practice.</p>
<p>Discussion on Breath</p>
<p>Breath comes from the nose and its energy spreads in the zhong (anatomical center). The zhong qi governs the upper-jiao&#39;s respiratory pathway, constantly connected with the lungs and stomach. It may be clear and slow or short and rapid, all sufficient to gauge the fullness or deficiency of the zhong qi. Therefore, the classics say that the movements below the breast correspond to clothing, indicating that the zhong qi is leaking. Is it possible for a person to be recklessly anxious, causing the zhong qi to surge and result in rapid breathing, leading to excess and thus deficiency? This refers specifically to exhalation as one aspect of breath. When one&#39;s movements are normal, yet breath has sound, this indicates stagnation of the lung meridians; not being able to lie down but breath has sound indicates stagnation of the yangming. This further demonstrates that the spread of breath is connected to the lung and stomach, referring again to exhalation as one aspect of breath. Exhalation is governed by the heart and lungs, while inhalation is governed by the kidneys and liver. In the midst of respiration, the spleen and stomach govern. Thus, the spleen and stomach, governing the middle-jiao, are the primary support for respiration. If energy accumulates and blocks the entrance at the esophageal gate, preventing its flow, it results in a critical condition of life and death.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br>Those skilled in nurturing life enable the qi of the upper gate to pass into the lower gate, and the qi of the lower gate to flow out through the two hidden passages, thus preventing harm. The upper and lower regions, each divided in breathing out and in, cannot be adequately described by merely the term &quot;breath.&quot; This understanding is known only to Zhongjing, who says that when breathing causes the shoulders to shake, the heart is firm; when breath draws the upper qi from the chest and leads to coughing, it is because the heart&#39;s fire causes the disturbance; when one breathes with an open mouth and shortness of breath, it suggests lung weakness and drool, indicating the division of breath dominated by exhalation, and not to be conflated with inhalation, which seems like an interpretation; yet, Zhongjing articulates this based on the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The analysis of expulsion being at both ends of inhalation is insufficiently comprehensive. Indeed, the heart fire dominates the lungs, leading to rapid and forceful exhalation, which must occur, as exhalation reflects the yang of the heart and lungs, not to be mixed with the yin of the liver and kidneys. When breathing causes the shoulders to move, it is merely the action of the fire. When breath draws the upper qi of the chest causing a cough, it results from the failure of the lung channels to descend, leading to a rebellious cough, again, due to the fire.<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a><br>When one breathes short and shallow, with symptoms of lung atrophy, expectorating phlegm that resembles gold, and suffering under an incurable condition akin to being punished by fire, this is commonly referred to as &quot;breath.&quot; Why, then, do we not simply call it by that name? It is because breath involves both exhalation and inhalation, and that which is divided cannot be easily grasped by sages. The affliction of exhalation pertains to diseases of exhalation, while the affliction of inhalation pertains to diseases of inhalation, which need not be stated further. The classics mention the child suffering from wind-heat, wheezing, and shoulder breath. There are many such instances regarding the sound of breath, yet they are not spoken of together, as the diseases of inhalation are more readily identifiable. However, there is concern that future generations may not fully understand, so let me elaborate: when inhalation is slight, the disease resides in the middle burner, and can be remedied immediately; the weak cannot be treated. In the upper burner, inhalation is rapid; in the lower burner, inhalation is slow. All of these are difficult to treat. Those with breathing that is shaky and tremulous are beyond cure.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a><br>In observing the delicate and frequent inhalations, the swift movement of qi in and out of the middle jiao indicates that it must be substantial; by addressing this, one can clear the obstructions in the middle jiao and achieve recovery. If it is insubstantial, the foundational elements of the liver and kidneys are unstable, their qi is light and erratic, deviating from the yang, making treatment impossible. This is especially critical when the obstruction between the cardia and pylorus does not resolve, marking a dire situation for survival. </p>
<p>In the upper jiao, the inhalation is quick, as the pathways of the heart and lungs are close. In cases where true yin is deficient, the yang fire rises without entering the lower jiao, hence the rapid inhalation. Therefore, one must not overlook the inhalation in the upper jiao. In the lower jiao, the inhalation is slow, since the pathways of the liver and kidneys are distant. When the original yang is declining, it is trapped by yin pathogens, making it difficult to ascend, leading to slow inhalation. Both true yin and original yang are affected, hence they are hard to treat. </p>
<p>If the breathing is irregular and shaky, then the qi of the ying and wei is already engaged, with only a thin thread of breath remaining; is that still viable? One must first differentiate the inhalation and exhalation to understand the condition, and upon grasping the situation, corresponding treatment should be precise. However, when analyzing breathing, how then do we differentiate the roles of the upper, middle, and lower jiao? Alas, it is subtle! </p>
<p>In summary:<br>When differentiating breathing, failing to separate exhalation from inhalation to assess conditions, even by the smallest margin, is an error by the physician.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br><strong>Listening to Voices</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: To hear and know is called being wise. Like distinguishing sounds, one can understand an object just by listening to its voice; even if it is not far removed, is it not truly profound? I will briefly mention the key points from the classics. The classics state: The liver, in sound, represents the &quot;horn&quot; and in voice represents &quot;call&quot;; the heart, in sound, represents &quot;sign&quot; and in voice represents &quot;laughter&quot;; the spleen, in sound, represents &quot;palace&quot; and in voice represents &quot;song&quot;; the lungs, in sound, represent &quot;market&quot; and in voice represent &quot;cry&quot;; the kidneys, in sound, represent &quot;feathers&quot; and in voice represent &quot;groan.&quot; When speech is chaotic, it is called nonsensical, this is the mix of both void and substance. When there are unfounded shouts, it is called wild words, this is the manifestation of substance. Speech that is bold and forceful, starting light and then heavy, indicates outer influences. Speech that is hesitant and cowardly, starting heavy and then light, indicates internal injury; when words do not connect, it is the Zheng sound; when no one initiates the conversation, it is solitary speech. These three types of evidence pertain to the void. Nasal obstruction with a heavy voice indicates a cold; hoarse voice with lip sores indicates possession; sudden silence in speech with retraction indicates a phlegm condition. Snoring with blocked speech indicates warm wind; confused speech and unsteady words indicate heat. A bubbling sound below the heart, starting with thirst and followed by vomiting, indicates blocked water. A gurgling sound in the throat indicates phlegm. If the intestines rumble like thunder, it indicates disharmony in the qi, related to dampness. In young children, convulsions with an inability to speak indicate heart heat. Complete silence is like a crow’s call, indicative of death. Various illnesses causing wheezing and a hoarse voice indicate severe conditions. If one can carefully observe these signs, they can indeed save lives. As for hearing the five voices to understand the suffering, this is the divine and wise method, existing solely in the heart of the one in charge of life.<br><strong>External Diagnosis Method [Question]</strong><a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Inner Canon</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Transformation of Essence and Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: I have heard the essentials from the Master; the Master said that one does not stray from color and pulse, and this is what I know. Qi Bo replied: The essence of treatment is in the unity. The Emperor asked: What is the meaning of unity? Qi Bo said: Unity is obtained through understanding. The Emperor inquired: How so? Qi Bo explained: Close the doors and seal the windows, and for the patient, repeatedly inquire about their condition to follow their intention. Those who gain spirit prosper, while those who lose spirit perish. The Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unity refers to spirit. When one obtains their spirit, all colors, pulses, essence, and qi are also obtained. To &#39;obtain&#39; means to derive from their feelings and intentions. Closing the doors and sealing the windows means to not let external thoughts intrude. Spirit resides in the heart; the movements of the heart and nature are termed feelings and intentions. Intention is what governs the spirit, gathers the soul, adapts to cold and warmth, and harmonizes joy and anger; hence, one should not let external thoughts distract, but frequently inquire into their feelings to follow their intention, thus grasping the existence or loss of their spirit. Those who lose spirit die, while those who gain spirit live.</p>
<p><strong>On the Three Parts and Nine Conditions</strong></p>
<p>It is imperative to carefully inquire about the initial ailment and the current ailments before taking each pulse to observe the floating or sinking of the meridians, and the reversal or following nature of the condition. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The initial ailment refers to an old and deep illness; the current ailment refers to the newly acquired, superficial ailment. Taking each pulse means to assess whether the affliction is in the yin or yang, in the organs or viscera. An old illness has a deep and reversed pulse, while a current ailment has a following and floating pulse; hence, one must observe the floating or sinking of the meridians, and the reversal or following nature.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p>
<h3>Commentary on the Principles of Zangqi</h3>
<p>For those with liver issues, clarity emerges at dawn, worsens in the late afternoon, and stabilizes at midnight.<br><strong>[Note: Dawn is when wood energy is strong, hence the clarity. The late afternoon is when metal energy is strong, hence the severity. Midnight receives the nurturing of mother energy, leading to tranquility.]</strong></p>
<p>For heart issues, clarity is present at noon, worsens at midnight, and is calm at dawn.<br><strong>[Note: The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: Spring grows, summer flourishes, autumn harvests, and winter stores; this is the natural order of energy. If one divides a day into four segments, dawn corresponds to spring, noon to summer, sunset to autumn, and midnight to winter, thus clarity arises at its rightful place, worsens when it cannot cope, and is calm when nurtured.]</strong></p>
<p>For spleen issues, clarity appears at sunset, worsens at sunrise, and is calm in the late afternoon.<br><strong>[Note: &quot;Yì&quot; refers to the decline of sunlight. It corresponds to the length of summer, hence clarity. Sunrise is when wood energy is strong, hence the severity. Late afternoon aligns with the division of the time into Shen and You, corresponding to the autumn&#39;s metal directive, thus calmness.]</strong></p>
<p>For lung issues, clarity is present in the late afternoon, worsens at noon, and stabilizes at midnight.<br><strong>[Note: Each day and night has five segments, each with its own cycles of growth, decline, and severity.]</strong></p>
<p>For kidney issues, clarity is present at midnight, worsens with the seasons, and calms in the late afternoon.<br><strong>[Note: The four seasons correspond to the time of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. For kidney issues, when water is strong, there is clarity; when earth is strong, there is severity; when metal is strong, there is calmness.]</strong><a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a><br><strong>Blood, Qi, Shape, Will</strong></p>
<p>When the shape is joyful and the will is bitter, illness arises from the meridians, treated with moxibustion and acupuncture. [Note: This refers to a noble person. They may alternate between nobility and humility, understanding life and death, and deciding success and failure.]</p>
<p>When the shape is joyful and the will is joyful, illness arises from the flesh, treated with needles and stones. [Note: If the shape is joyful and the will is joyful, it may lead to excessive ease, causing the spirit&#39;s mechanisms to stagnate, and Qi and blood to be trapped, resulting in illness in the flesh, which should be treated with needles and stones to invigorate and facilitate movement.]</p>
<p>When the shape is bitter and the will is joyful, illness arises from the tendons, treated with pressing and guiding techniques. [Note: If one labors their shape, it harms the tendons; if the will is at ease and joyful, the blood vessels have not fallen ill. Therefore, it should be treated with pressing and guiding to nourish the tendons with blood vessels, leading to peace.]</p>
<p>When the shape is bitter and the will is bitter, illness arises in the throat and palate, treated with sweet medicine. [Note: Various worries affect the heart, and countless matters exhaust the body, harming both Yin and Yang, Qi, and blood. The throat governs the atmospheric Qi, while the palate governs the earthly Qi. Since both Yin and Yang Qi and blood are harmed, illness arises in the throat and palate, hence sweet medicine should be used to regulate the spleen and stomach.]</p>
<p>When the shape is frequently shocked and afraid, and the meridians are obstructed, illness arises from insensitivity, treated with massage and medicinal brews. [Note: Shock disrupts Qi, and fear causes it to descend. Blood flows with Qi; if Qi is frequently disturbed or reversed, then the meridians will be blocked, and defensive and nutritive Qi will not circulate, leading to illness from insensitivity. Thus, massage and medicinal brews should be applied to promote the circulation of defensive and nutritive blood and Qi.]<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Five Errors</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In cases where the illness has not yet been diagnosed, it is essential to inquire whether one has previously experienced wealth followed by poverty. Even if there is no malevolent influence, the disease arises from within, termed &quot;loss of nourishment.&quot; When one has experienced prosperity followed by misfortune, it is called &quot;loss of essence.&quot; The five vital energies become stagnant, and ailments may coalesce; when physicians diagnose without considering the organs or changing the body&#39;s condition, they may feel uncertain and fail to identify the disease. The body continues to weaken, energy is exhausted, and there is a lack of essence; the illness becomes profound, leading to sudden fears. In deeper illnesses, there is a depletion of external defenses and an internal loss of nourishment. When skilled doctors make mistakes, they do not grasp the severity of the condition. This is also one of the errors in treatment.</p>
<p>(Note: The phrases &quot;wealth followed by poverty&quot; and &quot;prosperity followed by misfortune&quot; refer to injuries to one’s morale; hence, even without malevolent influences, the disease arises from within. The spleen stores nourishment, which expresses intention, while the kidneys store essence, which expresses will; thus, when will and intention are lost, essence and nourishment are depleted. Stagnation of the five vital energies refers to the spirit energies of the five organs being congested internally and not being able to flow freely. &quot;Coalesce&quot; means illnesses merge with those of the five organs.)<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br>The energy of the five organs intersects with the skin, hair, muscles, and bones; thus the body diminishes daily. When energy is deficient and there is no essence, and when the illness is deep with no energy, it is said that energy arises from essence, and essence arises from energy. The joint deterioration of essence and energy occurs. When one is anxious and fearsome, it signifies a loss of long-term wealth and honors, thus one is startled by the time. This illness does not reside in the organs and bowels, nor in the body shape; essence and energy diminish daily, and the protective and nutritive systems are consumed daily. Even a skilled practitioner may not know the cause of this condition. This is the first mistake in treatment.</p>
<p>Whenever one desires to diagnose an illness, they must inquire about diet and living conditions. Sudden pleasure and sudden suffering, pleasure followed by suffering, all harm essence and energy. When essence and energy are exhausted, the body becomes ruined and depressed. Sudden anger harms Yin, and sudden joy harms Yang. When the vital energy rises, it fills the meridians and separates from the physical form. A foolish doctor who treats this, without understanding how to tonify or drain, not recognizing the condition, will see essence and energy gradually escape, allowing evil energy to invade. This is the second error in treatment.</p>
<p>Note: Taste pertains to form, and energy pertains to essence. Taste harms form, and energy harms essence. Heat harms energy, while cold harms form.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a><br>Those who enjoy life must have more than enough to eat and wear, while those who suffer must endure hunger and cold. Therefore, when diet is unregulated and temperature is inappropriate, it all harms vital essence. When vital essence is exhausted, the body will be destroyed. If joy and anger are not in balance, then yin and yang are not harmonized, leading to the rising of pathogenic qi, and the pulse becomes full and departs from its form. </p>
<p>The upper half of the body represents yang, and the lower half represents yin. The muscles and skin represent yang, while the channels and blood represent yin. When yin and yang are peaceful, the qi and blood circulate smoothly both internally and externally. If one experiences violent joy, it injures yang, causing qi to bind within yang and lead to counterflow. If one experiences violent anger, it injures yin, causing blood to bind within yin and lead to a fullness in the pulse. The blood and qi of the muscular form are therefore considered to be full when they are within the pulse. </p>
<p>Excesses should be drained away, while deficiencies should be replenished. A foolish physician treats without understanding replenishing and draining, and without understanding the condition of the disease, leading to daily loss of essence and the mingling of cold and heat pathogenic factors. This is the dual error in treatment. Diagnosis has three constants and must inquire about wealth and status, including injuries from conflicts and desires for nobility.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br>Therefore, it is important to detach from power; even if one is not affected by malice, the spirit can suffer internal injuries, leading to bodily ruin. If one starts wealthy and ends up poor, although it may not cause harm directly, the skin will become scorched, muscles will weaken, and there may be paralysis or cramping. If the doctor cannot be strict and cannot move the spirit, the exterior will become weak and chaotic, disrupting the normal state. If the illness cannot be displaced, then medical practices will not function. These are the four errors in treatment.</p>
<p>(Note: In times of power loss, it is essential to detach from it, for the concern arises internally, hence the spirit suffers. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: worry, fear, anger, and injury to the vital energy—these three cannot be preserved and thus lose their normal state. Starting wealthy and ending in poverty harms one&#39;s will and intention. Intention is what governs the spirit, gathers the soul, and adapts to cold and warmth, harmonizing joy and anger. Therefore, when the protective and nourishing energies are balanced, and will and intention are harmonious, the tendons and bones become strong, and the pores are dense. Thus, when the will and intention are harmed, the spirit cannot be internally guarded, leading to external afflictions of tendons and bones, unbalanced protective energies, and open pores, resulting in external weakness, and all three also lose their normal state.)<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a><br>To stir the spirit means to move its essence. To move means to transform essence into qi. Regarding diagnosis, one must understand beginnings and endings, and have knowledge of residual effects. When taking pulses and asking names, one must consider the attributes of both genders. </p>
<p>Note: &quot;Beginnings and endings&quot; refers to the channels as outlines; all who diagnose must know them. &quot;Residual effects&quot; means further understanding the implications of moxibustion, acupuncture, nourishment, and depletion. &quot;Considering both genders&quot; indicates the essentials of acupuncture: men should be treated internally and women externally. Firmly resist not to let out, and be cautious not to let in; this is called receiving qi. </p>
<p>Separation from attachment, worries, fears, joy, and anger can lead to emptiness in the five organs, causing blood and qi to abandon their posts. If a practitioner cannot discern this, what can be understood by techniques?</p>
<p>Note: The left corresponds to the person’s welcoming and governs blood; the right corresponds to the mouth of qi and governs qi. &quot;Separation&quot; indicates the distinct categories of yin, yang, blood, and qi on the left and right. Thus, if both blood and qi are afflicted, qi becomes stagnant on the right and blood accumulates on the left.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br>Worry and fear harm the right organs of the lungs and kidneys, while joy and anger harm the left organs of the heart and liver, leading to emptiness in the five organs and the blood and vital energy being displaced from their proper positions. </p>
<p>Practitioners who do not understand that the energy entering the body has distinctions of yin and yang, nor the differences in blood and energy, are lacking in proper knowledge. When one experiences great distress, it can sever tendons and cut off vessels. The body struggles to function, resulting in stagnant fluids and unresolved accumulation, with pus and coldness. </p>
<p>If a crude practitioner treats this by hastily puncturing the yin and yang, the body becomes disintegrated and the limbs cramp. When death approaches, the doctor cannot see clearly; without inquiry into the cause, they merely speak of impending death—this too reflects a lack of skill. Such treatment mismanages in five crucial ways. </p>
<p>All these five instances arise from a misunderstanding of techniques and a lack of clarity in understanding human affairs. </p>
<p>Note: If one loses their wealth in a single day after having been prosperous, it greatly pains their spirit and soul. Thus, the heart governs the vessels, and the liver governs the tendons, as if severed; this represents harm to the left blood vessels. However, the right spleen has not been harmed, which is why the body can still function; the essence and energy governed by the lungs and kidneys remain unhurt, and thus still continue to grow without cessation.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br>Although the illness initially arises from the yin, over time it will affect the yang as well. Therefore, it injures and depletes the heart and liver blood, which then stagnates on the left side, resulting in a deficiency in the qi aspect that subsequently returns to the yang. Both the blood and qi on the left and right are harmed, leading to the accumulation of pus and cold heat. This occurs because the injury to yin causes it to weaken and return to the yang, hence the pus accumulates between the yin and yang, cold and heat. When both yin and yang, blood and qi are injured, supplementing the yang leads to the exhaustion of the yin, while draining the yin results in the loss of the yang. In such cases, one should only take sweet medicinals and should not resort to cauterization or needling. Inexperienced practitioners do not understand this and hastily puncture the yin and yang, leading to the disintegration of the body, which harms the spleen qi; if the limbs cramp, it signifies the exhaustion of the stomach qi. The spleen and stomach are the sources of life for the organs. Once the vital energy is exhausted, there is no chance for recovery. Even skilled physicians, if they are not aware of the interaction of yin and yang, and do not inquire into the cause of the illness, can only see the deterioration of yin and yang and the impending end; this too reflects a lack of understanding. They cannot discern the cause and appropriately administer treatment. All of these five factors arise within the five internal organs and are not due to external influences.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a><br>One must understand the qi of heaven and earth, the yin and yang, and the regularities of day-to-day affairs. Each has its own inherent principles; following them brings harmony and balance to one&#39;s intentions, while opposing them leads to harsh illnesses and violent outbreaks. This arises from a lack of mastery over the art and a failure to comprehend human affairs, culminating in five responsibilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said: When a sage treats illness, they must recognize the yin and yang of heaven and earth, the seasonal changes, the organs and viscera, and the interplay of male and female. Techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and the use of stones and poisons are all governed accordingly. One must approach human matters calmly to clarify the underlying principles. Status, wealth, and poverty all have their distinct qualities. Inquiry into youth and age, bravery and fear must also be pursued. By examining the differentiated pulse, one can identify the root of the illness. The eight principles and nine indicators must be diligently observed.</p>
<p>[Note: This summarizes the method of pulse diagnosis, which aligns externally with the yin and yang of heaven and earth, and the seasonal changes, while internally connecting with the organs and the male-female dynamics. Some methods may require moxibustion or acupuncture, while others may call for medicinal and dietary interventions. By addressing human affairs thoughtfully to clarify principles of status and wealth, and by understanding age and courage, one can discern the differentiated pulse and root cause of illness. Observing seasonal changes and the eight principles is crucial, and thus the diagnostic method is well-prepared and reliable.]<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br><strong>Questions About Feelings and Intentions to Diagnose Illness</strong></p>
<p>When inquiring about illness, one must ask what the individual thinks, fears, desires, and doubts. The core inquiry focuses on discerning the true and false aspects of yin and yang, and identifying the cold and heat of the organs. Diseases arise from the balance of yin and yang, and the conditions of the organs; understanding this clearly ensures effective treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Questions About the Five Flavors to Determine the Origin of Illness</strong></p>
<p>The sixty-first difficulty states: to understand, one should ask about the desired five flavors to know the origin of the illness. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that each flavor affects certain aspects: sour targets the tendons and excessive consumption can cause urinary issues; salty affects the blood and can lead to thirst; spicy influences qi and too much can create heart problems; bitter affects the bones and can cause vomiting; sweet impacts the flesh and can lead to anxiety. With this reasoning, one can ascertain the illness&#39;s origin by asking about the desired five flavors. Moreover, if a person excessively craves certain flavors, it indicates an imbalance in organ energy.<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br><strong>On Cold Damage</strong> by Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Question: When to restrain sweating and purging based on the state of qi movement</strong></p>
<p>When the qi moves to the right, sweating should not be induced. If sweating is induced, it leads to thirst and restlessness, making one vomit water upon drinking. When the qi moves to the left, sweating should also not be induced. Inducing sweating causes dizziness and persistent sweating, along with muscle and tendon spasms. When the qi moves upward, sweating must not be induced. If sweating occurs, the qi rises and obstructions occur at the heart. When the qi moves downward, inducing sweating is inappropriate. Sweating leads to no perspiration, great restlessness within the heart, pain in the joints, a feeling of cold in the eyes, and vomiting food with difficulty in digestion. If there is obstruction in the throat, sweating should not be induced. If sweating happens, it can lead to vomiting blood, a feeling of impending collapse, coldness in the hands and feet, and an overwhelming desire to curl up without being able to get back to normal.</p>
<p>When the qi moves to the right, purging should not be done. If purging occurs, the fluids will be depleted and the throat will feel dry, the nose will be blocked, dizziness and palpitations may arise. When the qi moves to the left, purging should likewise be avoided. If purging occurs, there will be abdominal constriction, inability to eat, increased qi movement, and despite a fever, the urge to curl up while lying down. When the qi moves upward, purging is not advisable. If purging is performed, the hands and palms feel hot and irritable while the body feels cold, resulting in spontaneous sweating and a desire for water to quench the thirst. When the qi moves downward, purging must not be done. If purging occurs, there will be abdominal bloating, sudden dizziness, food will not stay down, and there may be a sense of fullness in the heart. If there is obstruction in the throat, purging should be avoided. Inducing purging leads to a feeling of lightness above and heaviness below, fluids cannot be swallowed, the urge to curl up while lying down persists, and there can be severe pain, with multiple episodes of diarrhea.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a><br><strong>On the Treatment of Illness and Inquiry into Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: When there is heat in the middle, it causes coldness; when there is coldness in the middle, it produces heat. If there is heat in the stomach, it consumes food, leading to a restless heart and excessive hunger. If there is heat in the skin above the navel and heat in the intestines, it results in yellowish discharge resembling gruel. If there is coldness in the skin below the navel and coldness in the stomach, it causes abdominal bloating. When the intestines are cold, it leads to gurgling sounds and loose stools. This indicates that coldness in the intestines causes food to stagnate, resulting in gurgling and sharp pain, with stool appearing white. If the intestines are cold while the stomach is hot, it leads to intense hunger and pain in the lower abdomen. If both the intestines and stomach are hot, it results in bloating and diarrhea. It is not only heat in the intestines that causes diarrhea; coldness in the stomach, affecting digestion, can also lead to it. The stomach desires hot beverages, while the intestines need cold drinks. Despite differing preferences, in spring and summer one should first address the symptoms, while in autumn and winter, one should treat the root cause. Clothing should not be excessively cold or hot; one should not sweat from heat or feel despair from cold. Temperatures should be moderate, allowing the body to retain its balance and preventing the onset of ailments. Such guidelines are the standard practices, the principles of reason, and the measures of assessment. Treatment should be adapted to the situation, responding to changes as necessary.<a id="trans-242p" href="#orig-242p" class="marker">[242p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of external cold pathogens, along with illnesses caused by improper diet and labor that affect the physical constitution, and injuries from internal dietary issues, all exhibit signs of cold and heat. The entire world tends to misinterpret illnesses from internal dietary negligence and inadequate labor as those caused by external cold pathogens, thereby mistakenly treating superficial symptoms and resulting in an increase in casualties. This confusion primarily arises from an inability to distinguish between cold and heat.</p>
<p>Now, let us clarify this in detail: External cold pathogens cause fever and aversion to cold, with both cold and heat occurring simultaneously. The heat manifests as a vigorous fever, additionally producing a sensation that swells up and radiates outward, felt on the skin like the stroke of feathers, indicating that the heat is on the surface. This is a sign of external cold pathogens attacking the body&#39;s exterior. The skin and hair follicles represent the surface of Yang, nourished by the vital energy of defense. When cold pathogens invade, they obstruct the Yang aspect, preventing its expression, which in turn leads to fever.<a id="trans-243p" href="#orig-243p" class="marker">[243p]</a><br>The face is red, the nose is blocked and stuffy, the heart is troubled. With a slight exposure of the skin, one can no longer endure the cold. The surface shows only superficial heat. Despite heavy clothing and close proximity to a fierce fire, the chilling sensation cannot be resisted—the cold increases with each moment and day. One must wait for it to penetrate the interior before it subsides. The cold and heat arise simultaneously without interruption. </p>
<p>Internal injuries from irregular eating or excessive labor also cause headaches, neck stiffness, and lower back pain, which are somewhat similar to the superficial symptoms of the sun, yet differ significantly—this is clarified in the texts. Diseases caused by internal deficiencies occur when the exterior lacks yang, rendering it incapable of resisting wind and cold; this is common. The restless heat arising from the kidneys is different from the external cold evil. This is due to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, causing the vital qi to descend and disturb the kidneys and liver, leading to gradual weakness. However, if the stomach qi is normal, food enters the stomach, and the vital qi rises to nourish the heart and lungs, thereby sustaining the original qi of the skin and pores in the upper body.<a id="trans-244p" href="#orig-244p" class="marker">[244p]</a><br>When the body becomes deficient, the heart and lungs receive nothing, and the skin lacks yang. It loses the protection and warmth it needs, consequently becoming weak between the skin and hair. It becomes sensitive to wind and cold, especially in damp, shadowy places without sunlight, and reacts poorly to these conditions. This often occurs without interruption. However, by avoiding wind and cold, finding warmth, or adding clothing and covers to keep warm, the aversion to wind and cold can dissipate. This warmth arises not from external cold injury, but from heat generated within the skin and hair. It originates from dampness flowing downward from the spleen and stomach, blocking their pathways, which causes the yin fire to rise. This results in a steam-like internal heat that affects the head and spreads through the skin, causing the entire body to feel hot and restless. One must remain unclothed and in a cool place to relieve this condition. Alternatively, when heat becomes extreme and sweating occurs, this can provide relief. External injuries typically accompanied by chills and fever do not involve sweating. If one achieves sweating, then the illness is alleviated. Based on this distinction, is it not as clear as black and white? Those suffering from internal deficiency experience restlessness and heat.<a id="trans-245p" href="#orig-245p" class="marker">[245p]</a><br>The cause may stem from inhaling the cold air, which blocks the yin fire, causing obstruction in the throat and diaphragm. The inhaled air desires entry but is repelled by the fire of the ascending channel in the diaphragm, preventing the yin energy from entering. The qi within the chest is restrained by external cold winds and cannot expand, leading to a gaping mouth and bulging eyes. In extreme cases, sound escapes outward, and the qi is unable to rise or fall, becoming trapped in the throat and risking suffocation. </p>
<p>Additionally, it may occur due to hiccups, vomiting, or regurgitation, which stir up heat and restlessness, indicating an underlying cause for these symptoms. The signs of the exterior being weak and vulnerable to cold winds reappear. The weakness of the exterior is overpowered by the yin fire, causing transient restlessness. When the exterior is weak and lacks yang, it cannot withstand the reemergence of wind and cold. This weakness at the exterior is a constant issue, and the restlessness arises intermittently. When the restlessness presents, cold may emerge; conversely, when cold presents, restlessness may arise—this is different from the simultaneous onset of cold and heat due to external injury, which occurs without interruption.</p>
<p>All illnesses exhibit body heat, referred to as muscle heat or skin heat. It is only by palpation that one can discern this, as it pertains to the heat of the body&#39;s form. It is also necessary for yin and yang to be harmonized, for sweating to be the means of recovery. Care should be taken not to distinguish too finely in this matter! Because both internal and external conditions exist in a state of deficiency or excess, differentiating them is indeed difficult. Thus, rely on this explanation, and patients should discern their sensations of fever and chills, as well as the heat of restlessness, as the basis for diagnosis.<a id="trans-246p" href="#orig-246p" class="marker">[246p]</a><br>Distinguishing between External Pathogenic Influences and Internal Injuries from Diet and Labor</p>
<p>When distinguishing the serious effects of external pathogenic influences from the Eight Winds or from injuries caused by diet and labor, within two or three days, they often resemble external injuries. Other symptoms may have specific names. If these two types of conditions are not clearly differentiated, there is a risk of mistaking internal deficiencies as excessive external wind pathogens. Although the explanations may seem repetitive, the aim is to make it easier for patients to recognize their diseases and for physicians to treat them. </p>
<p>The external pathogenic influences of the Eight Winds are excess conditions; internal injuries from irregular diet and labor are deficiencies. Internal injuries may also lead to aversion to wind and sweating; however, if one is in a warm and windless place, they may not feel discomfort. This can closely resemble external injuries with symptoms like a runny nose, headaches, and sweating. Careful distinction is needed.</p>
<p>External wind pathogens typically manifest as aversion to wind, sweating, headaches, and runny noses, often becoming stronger at different times throughout the day until they penetrate deeper, leading to internal symptoms. The sounds of the voice may be heavy and hoarse, with nasal congestion that is unrelieved. The patient can still eat, has a normal sense of taste, and their bowel movements are regular. They may experience body aches and find it difficult to move, needing to lie down and use pillows without assistance.<a id="trans-247p" href="#orig-247p" class="marker">[247p]</a><br>Internal injuries are caused by irregular diet and exertion; however, they are also affected by wind. When one resides in a damp place and encounters a strong wind, it may not be harmful; yet, even a slight draft from the gaps of doors and windows can be quite detrimental. This differs from cold and flu symptoms. Additionally, there may be a runny nose and headaches accompanied by sweating. Breathing may feel short and insufficient; speech is also weak and breathless, leading to difficulties with eating or a lack of appetite, with these three symptoms interrelated.</p>
<p>Discomfort in the abdomen may occur, or there may be an urgent need that cannot be relieved. When the mouth forgets the taste of grains, urination is frequent without thirst. Initially, after exertion, one may fall ill, have a reduced appetite, and experience red or yellow urine. Bowel movements may be difficult, either dry or constipated, or one may feel weak and experience only small amounts of white pus, sometimes with abdominal distension. There can be yellow diarrhea that is watery or loose with a white hue, or constipation that does not relieve pressure, causing a sensation of fullness in the chest or pain akin to being stabbed, and these symptoms may not appear together.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the stomach or heart area may be painful, with pain in the upper body and flanks, reflecting a fiery disturbance below the navel that surges like an uncontrollable river, causing the Yangming channel to operate in reverse and disrupt the chest. This causes unrelenting gas and, in severe cases, leads to significant shortness of breath, heating the vital energy and resulting in limbs that cannot move, fatigue, and a desire to sleep. Because the external symptoms of wind and cold do not present this condition, it is easier to distinguish.<a id="trans-248p" href="#orig-248p" class="marker">[248p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing the Palm and Back of the Hand</strong></p>
<p>When internal injuries arise from overwork or irregular eating, the palm feels hot while the back of the hand remains cool. In cases of external injuries from wind and cold, the back of the hand feels hot while the palm does not. This distinction is very clear.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing the Mouth and Nose</strong></p>
<p>If injuries occur from eating, work, or excessive strain, the outer symptoms manifest prominently in the mouth, leading to loss of taste, abdominal discomfort, disinterest in speaking, and if compelled to respond, the voice will be weak and timid, with excessive salivation, and clear nasal discharge, which may fluctuate, indicating a yin condition. However, in the case of external injuries from wind and cold, the symptoms will prominently appear in the nose, causing blocked nasal passages, heavy and unclear voice, with speech being stifled but forceful, and the mouth will feel harmonious. In the case of cold damage, the face may turn red, the nose will be blocked and dry; in cases of wind damage, there will simply be a clear nasal discharge. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the nose is the indication of the lungs, and lung energy connects to the heavens. Therefore, when there is external injury from wind and cold, the nose will be affected. The mouth is associated with the earth, and spleen energy connects to the mouth; when eating is irregular or labor causes harm, the mouth loses the taste of grains and becomes indifferent to all flavors. It is also said that harm can occur from poor or harmful food. This is quite evident!<a id="trans-249p" href="#orig-249p" class="marker">[249p]</a><br><strong>Differentiation of Headache</strong></p>
<p>Internal headaches sometimes occur and sometimes cease. External headaches are often present and must be transferred to treat the underlying condition. This highlights the difference between internal and external symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation of Middle Heat Similar Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>During extremely hot weather, headaches may arise from labor on the road, in the fields, or from physical weakness, insufficient food intake, and excessive labor. Additionally, those who frequently practice virtue and fasting may experience prolonged deficiency of stomach qi and develop heat due to overexertion. All these resemble the symptoms of middle heat treated with Bai Hu decoction. There must be notable heat upon physical examination, along with restlessness, confusion, intense thirst, and a desire to drink water. Due to excessive labor, there may also be body aches. At the onset of the illness, it specifically resembles excess heat obtained externally; wrongly administering Bai Hu decoction could be fatal within ten days. This condition signifies severe deficiency of the spleen and stomach, insufficient vital energy, and shortness of breath. After noon, as the yangming period approaches, the illness must reduce significantly. In cases of external middle heat, symptoms intensify by late afternoon, with increased thirst and persistent agitation. Those who do not overexert themselves will not exhibit these symptoms and may recover easily. If there is a difficult or ambiguous presentation, it is necessary to wait one or two days for medical treatment to avoid errors.<a id="trans-250p" href="#orig-250p" class="marker">[250p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Suitable and Forbidden Medicines for Internal Injuries from Diet</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In the case of internal injuries, the pulses at the qi and mouth are greater than those of the human pulse by one, two, or even three times; thus, one should use targeted medications. It also mentions: If there is a pulse in the upper part and none in the lower part, that person should vomit, and if they do not, they will die. However, if food is not accepted and there is a feeling of nausea, regardless of the magnitude of the pulse, it is not appropriate to use the standard remedy for nausea; instead, one should use a finger or an object to probe and induce vomiting. If what caused the injury does not come out completely, one must further diagnose the pulse and inquire about the source of injury, using food and medicine to eliminate it according to the nature of the blockage, which is also described as cold being treated by cold. If there is a discharge and it descends, it corresponds to the use of the Taiyin (Greater Yin). At this time, it is essential to include herbs that elevate and promote, allowing the vital energy to rise. A blockage is treated by removing blockages, and one acts to straighten that which is curved. What does it mean to be curved? It refers to injury to the stomach&#39;s qi. What does it mean to be straight? It indicates the promotion of stomach qi. Thus, treating internal injuries related to diet allows for the enhancement of life energy and the restoration of stomach qi; this embodies correcting the curved to make it straight.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a><br>If one uses medicine according to the classification of injuries, the nature of the injured item—whether cold or hot, warm or cool, hard or soft—varies, making it difficult to establish a fixed method. One must adapt the treatment according to the specific injury, adjusting temporarily as needed. Additionally, it is important to inquire about the patient&#39;s constitution over time, as well as the nature of their injuries from cold or heat. If the patient enjoys eating and consumes food, then one should avoid using medicines that break the vital energy; if they eat out of hunger or distress, one should replenish the stomach’s energy. If compelled by others to eat, it may be necessary to reduce blood and enhance energy. </p>
<p>By examining the pulse, one can determine which organ is injured, thus allowing for appropriate medications for the illness. Is it wise to recklessly deplete the natural vital energy and risk losing the treasure of life? For example, if one first eats hot foods without injury, then follows with cold foods, and this results in undigested hot food causing harm, one should inquire about the quantities of the hot and cold foods consumed and adjust the medication accordingly. </p>
<p>If the injury is two parts from hot substances and one part from cold, then one should use two parts of cold medicine and one part of hot medicine combined to restore the vital energy. There are also instances where one drinks alcohol before consuming cold foods, or injures themselves with hot foods, cool water, or ice—each scenario must be considered. One should inquire about the items that caused the injury, measure the ratios of cold and hot medicines accordingly, and tailor the treatment to the specific condition without fail.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Day and Night: Heaviness and Lightness</strong></p>
<p>All illnesses worsen during the day and become calm at night; this indicates an excess of Yang, where Qi is affected but Blood is not. When illnesses worsen at night and are calm during the day, it signifies an excess of Yin, where Blood is affected but Qi is not. If there is fever during the day and calm at night, this indicates an abundant Yang presence. If there is calm during the day but fever and restlessness at night, it signifies that Yang qi has descended into Yin, referred to as heat entering the blood chamber. If there is restlessness and fever both day and night, this indicates an excess of Yang without Yin; urgent measures should be taken to purge the Yang and strongly replenish the Yin. If there is aversion to cold at night and calm during the day, it indicates that Yin and Blood thrive within their realm. If there is calm at night but aversion to cold during the day, it means that Yin qi has ascended into Yang. If there is aversion to cold both day and night, this indicates an excess of Yin without Yang; urgent measures should be taken to purge the Yin and strongly replenish the Yang. If there is aversion to cold during the day and restlessness at night, with inability to eat, this condition is called the intermingling of Yin and Yang, and it signifies death.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan period, Zhu Zhenheng)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>About Daily Life</strong>  </p>
<p>In treating illness, one must first inquire about daily living, diet, and habits.  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Fundamental Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>Every illness has a root, much like grass has roots. Removing the leaves without addressing the roots will leave the grass still standing. Treating illness without addressing its root is akin to removing plants without addressing their roots; if the illness is within the organs yet we treat the exterior, not only do we harm the stomach&#39;s vital energy, but we also aid the pathogenic factors—what does the physician say to this? My elder relative is seventy years old, robust in spirit yet thin in body. At the end of summer, he suffered from diarrhea, and by late autumn, various treatments were ineffective. Upon examination, I noted that although his illness had lasted long, his spirit remained undiminished, his urination scant and not dark, the pulses in both hands were thin yet somewhat taut. He mentioned feeling a slight oppression in the diaphragm and reduced appetite. I then realized this must be years of accumulated phlegm, lurking in the stomach and intestines. I asked him what he enjoyed eating throughout his life. He replied that he had never missed a day of eating carp for three years. I diagnosed that there was phlegm accumulating in the lungs. The lungs are connected to the large intestine, so the foundation of the large intestine must be unstable. It was necessary to clarify the source of this accumulation for it to clear on its own. I prescribed a strong decoction made with evodia, dried tangerine peel, green onion, radish root, and ginger, sweetened with sugar, instructing him to drink about one bowl. By probing with his finger, after half an hour, he expelled about half a liter of thick phlegm. That night, it reduced by half. The next morning he drank again and expelled another half liter, stopping the diarrhea. I then prescribed Pingwei powder, adding Atractylodes and Coptis, and within ten days, he was at ease.<a id="trans-254p" href="#orig-254p" class="marker">[254p]</a><br>The King of Dongyang, Zhongyan, encountered several people and came to report: &quot;Every day, my food always bends and descends through my throat, and is hard and dry, causing slight pain; I have no other discomfort. What illness is this?&quot; Upon checking the pulse, I found the right side very dry and the guan position particularly heavy, while the left side was relatively normal. I said: &quot;There is stagnant blood at the entrance of the stomach, and the qi is obstructed, turning into phlegm; this must be caused by the food. Speak clearly to me.&quot; He was not aware of it himself. I then asked: &quot;What do you often eat during the winter?&quot; He replied: &quot;Every day, I must drink a couple of cups of strong liquor early to dispel cold.&quot; I prescribed a remedy: half a silver cup of leek juice, to be drunk cold in small sips, until half a pound of leek juice is consumed, and the illness was relieved. In due course, this proved true.</p>
<p>Another neighbor, over thirty years old, was cunning and irritable, having long suffered from sores due to gonorrhea, which would flare up and then subside. At the beginning of summer, he experienced diarrhea and slight discomfort in the stomach. The doctor prescribed two doses of Zhong Tang, which left him in a stupor, feeling almost dead, until he recovered after a while. I checked his pulse; both hands were dry, with the right slightly taut as well. I said: &quot;This is a severe case of gonorrheal sores; take Danggui Longhui Pills without musk. After four doses, the diarrhea will lessen.&quot; I also prescribed Xiao Chaihu Decoction, remove Banxia, and add Huanglian, Shaoyao, Chuanxiong, and ginger, to be boiled into five or six doses for relief.</p>
<p>These three individuals all had dry pulses, some taut and some not, yet the treatments were vastly different. Without seeking the root cause, how can one discuss the medicine?<a id="trans-255p" href="#orig-255p" class="marker">[255p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Li Chen (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry About Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>First, ask: Is there pain in the head and body? Observe if there are continuous chills and fever due to external factors. If the palms are hot and the mouth is indifferent to taste, it indicates harm from food and weariness. There might be restlessness with heat in the five hearts and a cough; if someone is thin, it points to a deficiency of yin and excessive heat. Besides these three noted conditions, if there are mixed symptoms like malaria or dysentery, they must be recognized. From head to toe, questions must be detailed and symptoms carefully listened to. </p>
<p><strong>Does the head hurt?</strong> Continuous pain indicates an external injury, while intermittent pain suggests internal harm.<br><strong>Are the eyes red and swollen?</strong> They may be suddenly red and swollen, or persistent pain might be present.<br><strong>Is there ringing or deafness in the ears?</strong> It could be in one ear or the other. For those who have been deaf for a long time, one should be cautious about using only tonifying medicines and should also prescribe remedies to promote qi.<br><strong>Is there nasal discharge?</strong> It could be dry without mucus, blocked, consistently running, or even nosebleeds or alcohol-induced redness.<br><strong>Can you taste food?</strong> If they do not eat, but can recognize taste, it points to an external attack of wind and cold; if they eat and still cannot taste, it indicates internal harm from diet.<br><strong>Are you thirsty?</strong> Drinking cold water suggests thirst from heat, while drinking hot water indicates deficiency; excessive thirst in summer leading to frequent drinking suggests heat from summer.<br><strong>Is there a coating on the tongue?</strong> It could be white, yellow, black, or red and cracked.<br><strong>Are there toothaches?</strong> It may be in the upper or lower gums, or from a tooth itself.<br><strong>Is there stiffness in the neck?</strong> Sudden stiffness suggests wind and cold; prolonged stiffness indicates phlegm and heat.<br><strong>Is there a sore throat?</strong> Sudden pain often points to phlegm-heat, whereas chronic pain relates to deficiency below.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a><br>Is the palm of your hand hot? The back of the hand being hot indicates an external factor; the palm being hot points to internal injury. If both the back and palm are hot, it signifies a combination of internal injury and external factors. Are the tips of your fingers cold? Coldness suggests a chill; if not cold, it might indicate wind injury, while a naturally cold sensation indicates bodily weakness. Is there paralysis in the limbs? When the left hand or foot, or arm cannot raise or is painful, it relates to blood deficiency with fire. If the right hand or foot, or arm is affected, it pertains to energy deficiency with phlegm. Is there pain in the shoulders and back? Sudden pain is due to external factors, while chronic pain indicates deficiency and stagnation. Is there pain in the lower back or spine? Sudden pain is also due to external factors, while chronic pain signifies kidney deficiency with stagnation. Is there pain in the coccyx? Sudden illness suggests an invasion of the Taiyang channel, while chronic pain indicates fire in the Taiyang channel. Is there fullness in the chest? If there is fullness below, it is due to a mass in the chest; if not, it suggests an evil entering the Shaoyang channel, rather than a mass in the chest. Those who are habitually full in the chest often suffer from depression, phlegm, and fire with lower deficiency.<a id="trans-257p" href="#orig-257p" class="marker">[257p]</a><br>Do you have pain in the sides: either left or right, or both sides, or just a point of sharp pain? </p>

<p>Is there a mass or lump in the abdomen: either above the navel, below the navel, to the left of the navel, to the right of the navel, or in the center of the navel? Do not recklessly use sweating, vomiting, purging, or drugs that cause stagnation; it is advisable to include digestive and gas-relieving remedies.</p>
<p>Do you have heart pain: acute pain is due to cold, while chronic pain is due to heat or deficiency.</p>
<p>Are you feeling agitated: either just a sense of restlessness; or the urge to vomit without being able to, referred to as nausea; or excessive fear, referred to as anxiety.</p>
<p>Do you experience vomiting: either wet vomiting, dry vomiting, vomiting immediately after eating, or vomiting only after a long period of eating.<a id="trans-258p" href="#orig-258p" class="marker">[258p]</a><br>Is there diarrhea: it may be loose, watery, in the morning, immediately after eating, or in the evening; how many times does it occur in a day? </p>
<p>Is there constipation: if it is hard and causes thirst and bloating, it is due to heat; if it is hard but does not cause thirst or bloating, it is due to deficiency. </p>
<p>Is the urination clear and smooth: clear and smooth indicates an exterior condition, while dark and painful indicates an interior condition. Frequent urgency suggests deficiency with heat, and prolonged illness, especially in the elderly, can be dangerous. </p>
<p>Is there difficulty in urination: thirst indicates heat, while no thirst indicates deficiency. </p>
<p>Is there impotence: strong impotence indicates the presence of heat, while weak impotence indicates a lack of heat. </p>
<p>Has there been a history of hernia: for hernia, it is advisable to also soothe and regulate liver qi; one must avoid recklessly using medications that elevate or disturb qi. </p>
<p>Is there a history of rectal bleeding or hemorrhoids: if there is bleeding or hemorrhoids, do not excessively use drying medications, as it can harm the Yin and damage the organs. </p>
<p>Are there sores or scabies: with sores or scabies, one should avoid sweating; it is advisable to also clear heat, nourish blood, and dispel wind.<a id="trans-259p" href="#orig-259p" class="marker">[259p]</a><br>Do you often have dreams with lingering feelings of white fluid? If there are lingering fluid issues, it indicates a deficiency of essence, and one should not rashly sweat it out. </p>
<p>Do you have a partner? If a man engages in intimacy, his qi and blood can become severely deficient. Even if external pathogens are present, avoid using strong remedies; it is better to first tonify and then attack.</p>
<p>Do you experience weakness and soreness in your knees? Sudden weakness and soreness may indicate a deficiency due to dampness or prolonged illness of the stomach leading to kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>Do your feet swell and hurt? Swelling accompanied by pain often indicates wind-damp. If not swollen, but with thin and painful calves, it suggests blood deficiency or that damp-heat is affecting the lower body.</p>
<p>Do you feel heat in the soles of your feet? If there is heat, it indicates a deficiency of yang fire. Pain in the heels also points to kidney deficiency with heat. Coldness in the toes and palms suggests coldness.</p>
<p>Do you experience alternating chills and fever? Continuous symptoms indicate an external condition, while intermittent symptoms point to internal injuries. Cold during the day and heat at night signify yin deficiency leading to active fire.</p>
<p>Do you prefer hot or cold food and drink? A preference for cold suggests internal heat, while a preference for hot indicates internal cold.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a><br>Is there difficulty with digestion and transformation in relation to food intake? If one can eat but cannot transform, it indicates cold in the spleen and heat in the stomach. </p>
<p>Regarding the quantity of food and drink, those who can eat and drink are easier to treat, while those who cannot eat at all are harder to treat; however, in cases of cold damage, not eating is not harmful.</p>
<p>Is there consumption of wine or fried food? Wine drinkers often have phlegm and heat, while fried foods frequently disturb the upper body, potentially affecting the intestines and leading to damp-heat conditions.</p>
<p>Is there sweating? If there is sweating due to external factors, it indicates a common cold; if there is no sweating, it suggests cold damage; if there is spontaneous sweating mixed with symptoms, it indicates yang deficiency.</p>
<p>Is there night sweating? Sweating during sleep due to external factors indicates a mixed attack of pathogens, while internal damage suggests yin deficiency with fire.</p>
<p>Are there pains throughout the body and joints? External factors indicate a surface attack, while internal damage suggests insufficient qi and blood; heaviness and pain in the body indicate the presence of dampness.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between day and night in the heaviness? If it is lighter during the day and heavier at night, it may suggest a blood disorder, while lighter at night and heavier during the day indicates a qi disorder.</p>
<p>What is the age? Diseases in middle-aged individuals are generally more bearable. Elderly individuals tend to have mixed ailments, making it harder for them to endure.<a id="trans-261p" href="#orig-261p" class="marker">[261p]</a><br>For women who have had few births, their vitality and blood remain strong; for those who have had many births, especially as they age, they should be supplemented rather than forcibly treated. </p>
<p>In terms of illness duration: it may last several days, several weeks, or even years.</p>
<p>Is the condition compliant or not? If compliant, then their temperament is harmonious and their vitality and blood are easy to regulate; if non-compliant, then their vitality and blood are stagnated, and it is necessary to include in the prescribed medicine a measure to open stagnation and promote energy flow.</p>
<p>Have they ever mistakenly taken medication? If there has been a mistake, it disrupts vitality and blood, causing confusion in the meridians; for acute illnesses, immediate adjustment is necessary, while for chronic illnesses, after a day or two of pause, medication can be resumed.</p>
<p>Is the woman’s menstrual cycle regular? Sometimes it can indicate blood heat before menstruation or blood deficiency afterward. If there is an external influence during menstruation, once it ends, it should disperse; avoid indiscriminate medications as they may harm the blood reservoir.</p>
<p>Is menstruation absent? Are there symptoms like tidal fever, cough, diarrhea, blood loss, or leucorrhea? Can she eat? If she can eat, blood can be easily regulated and symptoms will soon diminish; if her appetite decreases and she gradually loses weight, it is dangerous.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a><br>Is there a mass or distention? If there is abdominal pain and fever with a solid mass present, it is a mass. Can there be movement in case of pregnancy? If there is a solid mass that can move without abdominal pain or fever, it indicates pregnancy. If there is significant abdominal distention with no solid mass upon palpation, it indicates a qi disorder, which may cause occasional seepage of menstrual flow. </p>
<p>After childbirth, inquire about chills and fever, abdominal pain, sweating, and coughing or wheezing: chills and fever often result from external pathogens. Abdominal pain typically arises from blood stasis or food accumulation. Sweating with only fever suggests severe deficiency of qi and blood. Coughing and wheezing indicate blood stasis in the lungs, which is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>In general, when the initial diagnosis is not yet established, it is crucial to inquire in detail. Patients must not conceal their ailments or fear medical consultation; physicians must be careful and thorough in their questioning, as one examination alone cannot fully reveal the condition. Beginners are advised to draft a separate inquiry sheet to regularly use when asking about illnesses. Once the overall diagnosis is established—as either an external pathogen, internal injury, or a mixed condition—the ancient methods must be adhered to, and one should not indiscriminately apply dispersing agents.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a><br><strong>Essential Reading for Physicians</strong><br><strong>Li Zhongzi, Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Not Losing Human Feelings</strong></p>
<p>I have often read the Inner Canon and reached the section on the fluctuations of conditions, which concludes with the phrase: &quot;Not losing human feelings.&quot; It never fails to make me sit up, sighing deeply at how profoundly it enters the human heart! The concept of not losing human feelings is something that physicians urgently need to grasp, yet it is exceedingly difficult. Generally, there are three types of human feelings: first, the feelings of the patient; second, the feelings of others; third, the feelings of the physician. </p>
<p>The feelings of the patient refer to how each organ has its own tendencies, and how the seven emotions have their own dominances. The yang organs should be treated with coolness, while the yin organs should be treated with warmth. For those who can endure toxins, a gentle remedy may be ineffective, while for those who are sensitive to toxins, a harsh remedy can cause harm. This illustrates the different energies of the organs. </p>
<p>Motion and stillness each have their own preferences and aversions, while food and drink are also liked or disliked. Those with a tendency toward auspiciousness may find unfavorable words hard to accept; those who are overly worried may be deceived by false reassurances. For those who do not believe, earnest advice is hard to enact; for the overly suspicious, profound words are met with suspicion. This reflects the differences in likes and dislikes. Wealthy individuals tend to indulge their desires and disregard restrictions; those in high positions often self-important and arrogant, disregarding reason. This highlights the differences in interpersonal interactions.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a><br>The poor lack adequate clothing and food, let alone medicine; the distressed toil excessively and suffer, revealing their inner turmoil. This reflects the differences in treatment. There are wise words that, when initially trusted, may turn into false views; many paths lead to straying, leading to unfulfilled hopes. This is the danger of having no guidance. Some are overly fearful of the extraordinary and only seek concealed truths; a little firewood and a cup of water cannot prevent their demise—this is the danger of excessive caution. Some find external circumstances do not align, failing to achieve their goals, experiencing deep affection and attachment that good medicine cannot remedy—this illustrates the harm of gains and losses. Those with acute conditions suffer delayed healing from additional treatments; those with chronic conditions facing sudden illness may become stagnant and difficult to reverse. This shows the harm of recognizing urgency and delay. Some taste medicines with hesitation, fearing that ceasing to take them will cause blockage; some fear that strong medicines will cause them to lose their spirit, demonstrating the perils of mental state. There are those who hide their ailments and conceal their feelings, even pretending to mask symptoms, attempting to diagnose through pulse alone, unaware that throughout history, no wise person ever relied solely on this method without questioning or observing. For instance, if the pulse at the qi point is strong, it indicates harm from food. Can one really discern the precise day of injury or the nature of what was harmed solely from the pulse? These are insights about the patients’ conditions that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a><br><strong>Six Essentials of Medical Guidelines</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanyan)</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Inquiry into Illness</strong></p>
<p>In diagnosing an illness, one must first ask about the person being examined: whether they are male or female, old or young, a servant or a maid. Next, inquire about the onset of the illness, its causes, the state of appetite and digestive energy, the nature of bowel movements, any medications previously taken, and the patient&#39;s condition during the day and at night, including any sensations of fullness, pressure, or pain in the chest area. </p>
<p>If the patient answers without clarity, it may indicate deafness; one should then ask whether they have been hard of hearing for long. Otherwise, if the illness has persisted for too long or if excessive sweating has occurred, it may lead to temporary deafness. A patient who is reluctant to speak or merely nods indicates a deficiency of vital energy.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a><br>Confused and unaware of one&#39;s condition, is it due to a violent seizure? Or from a prolonged illness? Women often have phlegm. </p>
<p>A woman should inquire about the condition of the lunar water. A widow’s vital energy and blood become stagnant, feeling like more than two feet of accumulation, which should not be mistakenly diagnosed as a fetus. The same applies to unmarried women. If there is swelling and pain in the abdomen, it is essential to ask whether it is a previous illness or something newly arisen. </p>
<p>In diagnosing an illness, one must ask what flavors are desired and what things are favored, whether it be indulging in wine or practicing vegetarianism. A liking for sour indicates liver deficiency, whereas a fondness for sweet indicates spleen weakness. Head, body, and arm pain should always inquire if there have been previous sores.</p>
<p>Wang Haizang said: When a common person seeks diagnosis, they remain silent, allowing only pulse diagnosis to determine their illness. The pulse reflects a person’s vital energy and blood through the meridians; if heat predominates, the pulse is rapid, if cold prevails, the pulse is slow. A strong pulse indicates fullness, while a weak pulse indicates deficiency. As for the cause of the illness and what was injured, can it truly be known through the pulse? Therefore, a physician must not neglect to ask for the cause, and the patient must not fail to explain their reasons. </p>
<p>Zhongnian Sun stated: It is most reliable to ask before diagnosis. Su Dongpo remarked: The difficulty of understanding the pulse is an issue both ancient and modern. In cases of deficiency, there might be an excess condition; in cases of true fullness, there can appear signs of emaciation. Between doubt and certainty lies the difference between life and death. Scholars often keep their ailments secret to test a physician’s ability. Throughout my life, when seeking treatment for ailments, I always fully disclose my conditions. This enables the physician to clearly know where the illness lies, distinguishing between deficiency and fullness, cold and heat, establishing understanding in their mind first, then proceeding to pulse diagnosis, lest doubt mislead their judgment.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a><br>I seek only to recover from illness; how can I burden the physician? In obstetrics, first inquire about the ease of sitting on the grass, the amount of lochia, the timing of meals, and the survival of the child. There are differences between injuries to the form and injuries to the blood, thus the need to supplement qi and blood differs. Eating and drinking should be regular; if the child does not survive, one must also open the stagnation. Ask about desires to understand the illness. If one craves heat, it indicates cold; if one desires cold, it indicates heat. If one prefers stillness and dislikes movement, it indicates deficiency; if one is restless, it indicates excess. Aversion to food indicates food injury, and aversion to wind indicates wind injury. Craving sweet food suggests spleen deficiency, craving spicy food suggests lung disease, craving sour food suggests liver deficiency, craving salty food suggests kidney weakness, and an appetite for bitter food suggests heart disease. These conditions are in harmony and easy to treat. However, if someone with heart disease craves salty food, someone with lung damage desires bitter, someone with spleen weakness enjoys sour, someone with liver disease prefers spicy, and someone with kidney decline craves sweet, these are contrary signs. Light illnesses may become serious, and serious cases lead to death. If treated with the correct method and medications are taken for prevention, revival is still possible. </p>
<p>For example, when Tang Ruzheng treated a child suffering from wind-heat, the child fully healed except for the crown of the head. Inquiring into the cause, he learned that the wet nurse enjoyed hot wine, which he recognized as toxic. By doubling the use of kudzu and Coptis in his formula, the child was ultimately cured.<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a><br><strong>Medical Laws</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry into Illness</strong></p>
<p>Medicine is an art rooted in compassion. A benevolent person must be deeply attuned to emotions; when they are, they see others as themselves, inquiring about their suffering without omission. In ancient times, practitioners would close doors and cover windows, asking patients about their conditions repeatedly to understand their intentions. If one can genuinely please the patient, the inquiries will not feel burdensome to the questioner, nor will they be unwelcome to the patient. This allows for thorough investigation and accurate treatment. </p>
<p>An imbalance can arise when the rich become poor—their ailments may be miscategorized. Similarly, when one is affluent but loses vitality, their condition might be misdiagnosed. Additionally, physical and mental states of joy and sorrow can result in similar ailments that require different treatments; disruptions in diet and daily routines during seasons and festivals; afflictions of worry and fear that agitate the spirit; personal preferences and aversions that create distinct dispositions; and varying individual temperaments regarding what is suitable or harmful. </p>
<p>Without inquiry, how can one tailor treatment appropriately? Therefore, one should learn the customs of a country, understand the taboos of a family, ask the appropriate questions in a formal setting, and inquire about what the patient finds comfortable. The comfortable aspects include their living conditions, movements, responses to heat and cold, and the suitability of their emotional state. For instance, if a patient’s illness is identified as heat, one can employ cooling methods; if identified as cold, warming methods can be used. This approach aligns treatments with the patient’s condition. </p>
<p>Many are rigid in their own opinions; opposing their views may offend, while accommodating them may exacerbate their illness. There is no better way than this.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a><br>If one sincerely inquires, clearly stating that this leads to good and that to failure, who would willingly choose death and not adjust their heart to follow? As for the conditions of illness, there are countless complexities. For instance, in the early stages, when one suffers from severe thirst, and after a long illness when the mouth remains moist, if one does not inquire and applies the common treatment indiscriminately, will this not harm the patient? Similarly, if someone who was previously healthy suddenly has a condition that grants relief, if one does not inquire and recklessly decides on a treatment based on a schedule, will this not harm the patient? If a person has a chronic illness even before they fall ill, and if they become seriously unwell and acquire new ailments, if one does not inquire and rigidly adheres to established treatments, will this not harm the patient? In cases of difficult diagnoses, if one is determined to ask but cannot uncover the truth, and hears irrelevant comments that could turn real, if one does not ask in detail and hastily makes a blind decision, will this not harm the patient? The section on symptoms states: ask about the illness to know its nature, which is termed skillful. Today, those called skillful often inquire about what is not to be asked, flattering amidst it. The patient, delighted, follows this, and as the illness worsens, the medical response remains the same, leading to indecision regarding treatment. When one unexpectedly meets a knowledgeable person, they still refrain from taking action. This calls for careful guidance, as if addressing a sovereign or parent; one cannot be nonchalant or external in such matters. Even more astonishing are ignorant friends and relatives who inquire, forgetting their own ignorance, vainly flaunting their knowledge, speaking falsely and asserting truths, pointing to fire while labeling it phlegm. Who can say they are blameless while making easy statements? They sit idly, conforming and catering, creating shallow currents without any resolution; this is truly lamentable! We must be clear in self-discipline, sincere in motivating others, and together withstand the turbulent waves!<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a><br>In treating illnesses, if one does not inquire into the patient’s circumstances, one fails to grasp the essence of the ailment. A hasty diagnosis, accompanied by unfounded medication, leads to significant harm and disability, which reflects the physician&#39;s mistake. </p>
<p>In discussing treatment, one must not overlook the five critical principles and the core teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; If one fails to consider the three constants in diagnosing an illness, does not recognize similarities and distinctions, does not observe the patient&#39;s spirit, and does not adhere to the teachings of the sages, then one transgresses against the standards and bears the responsibility for the failures in treatment. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; proper management prioritizes the latter over the former, which emphasizes the need to accurately assess the patient’s condition. When it comes to diet and lifestyle, the error lies in not understanding the unique emotional responses of each patient. </p>
<p>The principles of comparison and the extraordinary versus the ordinary are crucial for physicians. Just like an experienced judge makes decisions based on precedents not explicitly mentioned in the law, physicians must rely on comparison, without missing any details. Recognizing the extraordinary and the ordinary involves careful consideration of the peculiarities of the illness. </p>
<p>When employing comparative methods, it is essential to analyze the condition in detail, avoiding superficial or simplistic approaches. The principle of three constants serves as guidance; failure here stems from an inability to rigorously address the illness, leading to inadvertent anxiety and distress, while merely appearing gentle and accommodating to the patient.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a><br>The practitioner must understand the beginning and end of each phase, observe the changes in complexion and energy, know the remaining signs after the onset of illness, differentiate the responses of men and women, and be aware of the internal injuries caused by the seven emotions. Therefore, if the bonds of affection are strained, the soul wanders; if one is consumed by cherished thoughts, the mind becomes lost; if worries accumulate, the spirit exhausts itself; if grudges are harbored, the will suffers. Those who are troubled become stagnant and inactive, those filled with fear become anxious and lose their guard, those in great anger become confused and unhealed, and those who are excessively joyful become careless and cannot contain themselves. Because of these eight states, the five organs may become empty, and the blood and vital energy may become detached from their rightful place. </p>
<p>If one often causes great harm during examination, it is not merely a loss beyond one’s share; even if the body recovers, the fluids may not nourish it. When blood and energy become internally stagnant, if they thin in the yang channels, they transform into pus, and if they accumulate for long in the abdomen, they manifest externally as cold and heat. It is not just the unlearned who are coarse practitioners; even those who thoroughly study the texts yet do not discern the three constants or appropriately assess the five excesses also practice in a rough manner.</p>
<p>Failing to distinguish between yin and yang during diagnosis is a critical error in treatment.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a><br>Receiving teachings without completing them leads to the arbitrary practice of mixed arts; misleading words become the way, and one rebrands oneself with others&#39; merits. The reckless use of acupuncture stones later brings harm to oneself. These are two failures in treatment.</p>
<p>Inappropriate living conditions related to wealth and status, sitting in comfort or discomfort, exposure to cold or heat, and not matching food and drink to one&#39;s needs, along with misjudging others’ courage or fearfulness, and a lack of awareness in comparisons, are enough to cause chaos and insufficient clarity. These are three failures in treatment.</p>
<p>Diagnosing illness without inquiring about initial worries, dietary irregularities, or excessive lifestyle, or ignoring the effects of toxins, then ultimately relying only on pulse diagnosis—what illness can be accurately diagnosed? Forgetting to express and clarify leads to rough outcomes. This is the fourth failure in treatment.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a><br>The Comprehensive Book of Jingyue by Zhang Jieben (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Inquiry and Diagnosis</p>
<p>In diagnosing illnesses, there is no method more exquisite than taking the pulse. However, some diseases correspond with the pulse, while others do not; within this lies profound principles. Therefore, when facing ambiguous and difficult cases, it is essential to employ the four diagnostic methods, thoroughly inquire into the origins of the illness, and discern the patient&#39;s voice and complexion. It is crucial to correct the order of primary and secondary issues with reason, thus attaining the truth. If one neglects this and only relies on a single diagnosis, carelessly treating at random, how can one grasp the numerous truths and falsehoods of the pulse? When discrepancies arise, how can one avoid mistakes? Moreover, those who frequently diagnose find it easier, while novices face significant challenges. This is why the four diagnostic methods should never be overlooked. Therefore, the &quot;Nanjing&quot; places pulse-taking at the end of the four diagnostics, which serves a profound purpose. Tao Jie&#39;an also states: &quot;Inquire about the illness to understand its external aspects, observe the pulse to grasp its internal condition; it all hinges on the key concepts of being dynamic, which is the essence of pulse-taking during clinical practice.&quot; This principle is explained most thoroughly by Wang Shishan.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a><br><strong>Inquiry about Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about cold and heat pertains to the internal and external states of cold and heat, aiming to distinguish whether they are present superficially or internally. When a person suffers from cold, the illness manifests as heat. Therefore, any condition where the body shows signs of heat, with tight pulses, headache, body aches, and rigidity without sweating, especially if it arises suddenly, can be attributed to external pathogens. This is because the cold evil is in the meridians, causing headaches and bodily pains; the pathogen obstructs the skin and muscles, leading to rigidity and fever. If one does not have a chronic illness but suddenly exhibits these symptoms, it is often due to external influences. Since the cold evil is not something chronic but appears suddenly, this is a superficial condition. If there are no superficial symptoms but the body’s heat persists without abatement, it is more likely indicative of internal injury. However, there must be corresponding internal signs that align together to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>In general, if body heat continues for ten days or even over a month, it may still correspond to superficial conditions. This is often because of an initial exposure to cold evil, leading to body heat and headaches. If a physician cannot discern the condition and mistakenly diagnoses it as heat, treating it with cold remedies can prevent the pathogen from dispersing, or even if it is eventually treated, if the medication does not reach the ailment, it can lead to retention in the meridians, with a prevalence of external symptoms and fewer internal signs. This does not signify an internal issue; it still requires dispersing treatment.</p>
<p>For internal conditions that cause fever, they are mostly related to Yin deficiency or due to accumulated heat. Nonetheless, there must be corresponding internal signs, and the development of these conditions is gradual. It is understood that Yin deficiency must harm the essence, and harm to the essence must involve the organs.<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a><br>Thus, when it is located above and connects with the lungs, it must lead to symptoms of wheezing, urgent coughing; when in the middle and connected with the spleen, it may hinder digestion, cause distension and frustration, or lead to irritability and extreme thirst; when located below and connected with the kidneys, it might result in issues like seminal or urinary incontinence. Yet, there must be a fluctuation of cold and heat, appearing and disappearing at times, or a timid voice with subtle sound, all indicative of yin deficiency.</p>
<p>All forms of anger and emotional disturbances harm the liver and organs causing heat, which are collectively due to insufficiency of true yin, hence the evil fire easily ignites, indicating yin deficiency as well.</p>
<p>Any fatigue harming the spleen resulting in fever is due to insufficiency of spleen yin, making it prone to injury. When injured, heat arises in the muscles, again suggesting yin deficiency.</p>
<p>As for internal accumulation of heat, when symptoms of distention appear, there must be tangible evidence, and in terms of blood and qi, there must be clear signs, whether heat in the nine orifices above and below or heat in the organs within the three burners. If the heat is truly from excess, all fire-related injuries on the body that do not involve true essence will have a robust appearance in form, qi, voice, complexion, and pulse, and this should be treated with the method for excess fire.</p>
<p>Cold symptoms are particularly evident, whether external cold indicates yang deficiency at the surface or internal cold signifies depleted fire within, similar to previous symptoms. However, excess heat tends to be more pronounced, while deficient heat is the most easily mistaken. Excess cold is usually more apparent, while there can also be some cases of true cold. This distinction between cold and heat, both externally and internally, must be made clear.<a id="trans-276p" href="#orig-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a><br><strong>On Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about sweating also serves to observe the exterior and interior. Generally, when exterior pathogenic factors are vigorous, there will be no sweating. When one is sweating, it indicates that the pathogenic factor is being expelled along with the sweat, implying the absence of exterior pathogenic factors; this is a natural principle. Thus, when the pathogenic factor has diminished completely and sweating occurs, the body cools and heat recedes, indicating the departure of the pathogenic factor. If the pathogenic factor remains in the meridians while sweating occurs only on the skin, this is not genuine sweating. After sweating, if the pathogenic factor has slightly reduced but not completely eliminated, residual pathogenic factors still exist; therefore, one should not hastily conclude that there are no exterior pathogenic factors based solely on sweating, but must carefully examine the pulse and symptoms.</p>
<p>In instances of warmth, summer heat, and similar conditions, there are cases where sweating is caused by pathogenic factors, while others may sweat without dispelling the pathogenic factor—both are exterior symptoms. In summary, if the exterior pathogenic factors have not been eliminated, they will affect the channels externally, leading to possible pain in the head and body; if they affect the internal organs, this may cause restlessness or anxiety in the chest and diaphragm. In both exterior and interior cases, there are symptoms to rely on; whether the pulse is tight or rapid can provide diagnostic differentiation. One must discern the authenticity, vacuity, and solidity of conditions, identifying what is slight and what is severe in order to treat accordingly.</p>
<p>If there are symptoms that are entirely unrelated to exterior factors, there may be cases of yang deficiency causing sweating, which requires tonifying the qi; for yin deficiency causing sweating, one should nourish the essence; if there is excessive fire causing sweating, one should cool it for self-recovery; if excessive drinking leads to sweating, clearing it may bring tranquility. It is crucial to investigate the yin-yang and exterior-interior aspects of sweating symptoms. Detailed information on sweating symptoms can be found in the chapter on febrile diseases; thus, it shall not be elaborated further here.<a id="trans-277p" href="#orig-277p" class="marker">[277p]</a><br><strong>Inquiry about Head and Body</strong></p>
<p>To inquire about the head allows one to assess the upper and lower aspects. To inquire about the body allows one to perceive the exterior and interior. Headaches indicate that pathogens reside in the Yang regions, while body pains suggest pathogens exist within the meridians. One can discern yin and yang through the front, back, left, and right; the presence or absence of heat reveals internal and external conditions. If it is purely an exterior pathogen, dispersing it will lead to recovery.</p>
<p>In cases where excessive internal heat causes headaches, there must be an internal correlate, possibly located in the throat or ears, discernible by the absence of body heat or aversion to cold. Here, the heat is excessive in the upper part, with the disease being internal. One should examine which meridian is affected, and it is appropriate to clear and reduce it. High heat should be suppressed; this is the principle. If one uses a light, uplifting dispersal remedy, the fire will only rise further, worsening the pain.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by yin deficiency, they can arise unpredictably due to excessive indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures, or due to overwork, or emotional disturbances, leading to exacerbated symptoms. This is an internal condition related to essence or qi and requires tonification.</p>
<p>Most headaches attributed to internal factors stem from heat, which is commonly observed. However, there are cases where cold yin is present above, and yang deficiency fails to lift, resulting in intense pain. Symptoms may include aversion to cold and vomiting, and the pulses may be weak or thin. When treatments prove ineffective, remedies such as cinnamon, aconite, ginseng, and similar warming herbs may lead to recovery. This indicates a headache associated with yang deficiency.</p>
<p>The term &quot;head wind&quot; is an informal catch-all in popular usage; however, it must have a basis and requires investigation of its root cause to discern the appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-278p" href="#orig-278p" class="marker">[278p]</a><br>In cases of dizziness or heaviness of the head, one can distinguish between reality and illusion based on these symptoms. Usually, dizziness in the context of illness arises because the clear Yang does not ascend, leading to an upper deficiency. As Danxi mentioned: &quot;Without phlegm, there is no dizziness,&quot; which is not a truly accurate statement. It is necessary to consider the physical condition and differentiate between temporary and prolonged symptoms. According to the Inner Canon, when the upper is deficient, there is dizziness; when the upper is excessive, there is heat and pain, and the meaning is clear. Heaviness of the head particularly corresponds to an upper deficiency. The classic states: &quot;When the upper qi is insufficient, the brain is not filled, and the head suffers from tilting.&quot; This is what is meant. </p>
<p>As for severe body pain, one should also examine both the exterior and interior to differentiate between cold and heat. If the pain arises from an invasion of cold, it can occur in the upper or lower body, with no fixed location, and it dissipates by itself; this is an exterior pathogen. If the pain is localized and there are no other exterior symptoms, it belongs to the category of painful obstruction; despite the pathogenic qi residing in the channels, it should be confirmed through interior symptoms, distinguishing only between cold and heat. In cases of excessive fire, there may be skin burning, persistent redness and swelling, or internal thirst; there must be corresponding heat symptoms, and treatment should focus on clearing and cooling. If there are no heat indicators but the pain persists, it is often due to yin cold, which causes blood and qi stagnation. The classic states: &quot;Pain is caused by excess cold; therefore, to alleviate the pain, one must warm the channels to promote the flow of blood and qi, allowing the pathogens to exit on their own.&quot; </p>
<p>In cases of significant strain and sudden severe body pain, this indicates extreme yin deficiency that fails to nourish the tendons and bones, leading to a state of depletion. The nutritive qi is exhausted and thus ineffective.<a id="trans-279p" href="#orig-279p" class="marker">[279p]</a><br><strong>Inquiry on the Two Excretions</strong></p>
<p>The two excretions serve as the gateways of the body. Regardless of internal injury or external influences, one must observe these to distinguish between cold and heat, deficiency and excess. The preceding yin connects to the bladder, allowing one to discern its beneficial or detrimental effects, heat or lack of heat, and the strength or weakness of the body&#39;s Qi. In cases of cold damage, if urination is easy and plentiful, this indicates that the influence of the Tai Yang (Greater Yang) is not severe, which is a favorable sign. The latter yin opens the gate of the large intestine, allowing one to observe its passage or blockage, and whether there is accumulation or not, in order to gauge the deficiency or excess of the Yang Ming (Lesser Brightness). If there is feverish constipation and a hard, full abdomen, this indicates excess, and one can take measures to alleviate it. However, if recent defecation was obtained but the stool is not too dry, or if one has not defecated for ten days yet feels no bloating, then this does not indicate true Yang Ming excess. According to Zhongjing: if the stool is hard at first and then becomes liquid, it should not be purged. This shows that, although there was initial hardness, later looseness does not indicate true heat. Furthermore, if there are continuous loose stools for several days, that too can be understood. If there are no true signs of hardness, dryness, or fullness, then it is evident that there is no true excess to be attacked. Generally, if urination is merely yellow, one may think it a sign of fire, not realizing that when a person is fatigued, urination can also appear yellow. Persistent worry and overthinking can also lead to yellow urine, as can chronic diarrhea. Drinking alcohol excessively can harm the yin, resulting in yellow urine as well.<a id="trans-280p" href="#orig-280p" class="marker">[280p]</a><br>If there is no true heat or pain, and the conditions of heat are accompanied, one cannot assume that yellow urine indicates fire. I have seen many who, due to the forcing out of vital fluids, have met their demise. The classics say: when the central qi is insufficient, urination and bowel movements will change, which is clear in meaning. If the urine is clear and beneficial, it indicates that the internal pathogenic influence is not severe, and the illness is not in the qi aspect. When the body’s fluids are transformed by qi, if the illness is qi-related, urination will not be beneficial. If urination gradually becomes beneficial, it indicates that the transformation of qi is evident, which is a good sign. </p>
<p>The large intestine is the sea for the processing of food and drink, the gateway of the stomach and intestines. The bladder is the sea for blood and qi, the passageway of the chong and ren channels. Both urination and defecation are governed by the kidneys, which are essential for original qi. One must truly observe the actual pathogenic influences before discussing matters of regulation and expulsion. Otherwise, it is best to observe carefully and prudently, to avoid misguided action. If one pursues what is not real, causing the loss of original qi, those superficial pathogenic influences may take advantage of the resulting emptiness and delve deeper. Consequently, internal struggles will inevitably lead to further depletion through purging. Therefore, in cases of insufficient illness, one should not force expulsion. The ideal situation is when urination benefits by obtaining qi and transforms by itself, while bowel movements being solid indicates improved health. When both ying and wei (nutritive and defensive qi) are balanced, there will naturally be passage. Even if the large intestine is blocked for ten days or more, there should be no concern. If one experiences loose stools without control, this should not be the case for those who are truly weak; preventing this should be the priority.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a><br><strong>Inquiry on Diet</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about one’s diet serves two purposes: first, it allows us to observe the clarity or turbidity of the appetite; second, it helps us assess the yin and yang of the organs. When illness arises from external factors yet the appetite remains, it indicates that the pathogen has not affected the organs, and we can understand whether the food is agreeable or not. If the illness is due to internal injury and the eating habits change, we can discern one&#39;s preferences for flavors, indicating a liking for cold or heat. Those who desire warmth know the yin organs require warmth; those who prefer cold understand that the yang organs benefit from being cleared. Sometimes, disturbances in eating and drinking can lead to inadvertent harm, and changes in diet can provide clues for diagnosis. Hence, the nature of one’s diet should be carefully examined, and the appropriateness of medicinal foods can be inferred from it. Generally, if a patient feels slightly reassured by food, it indicates a deficiency syndrome. If the appetite grows stronger, it could indicate either deficiency or excess, which must be distinguished and treated accordingly.<a id="trans-282p" href="#orig-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a><br><strong>Inquiries Regarding the Chest</strong></p>
<p>The chest, or the central part of the thorax, connects above to the heart and lungs and below to the organs of digestion. There are numerous diseases of the chest and abdomen, making it difficult to enumerate them all. However, when diagnosing a patient, one must inquire in order to discern whether there is an evil presence and whether to replenish or drain. Generally, if there is distension and fullness in the chest and abdomen, one should avoid using tonics; if there is neither distension nor fullness, one should avoid purgatives. This is a fundamental principle. However, &quot;pí&quot; (a specific feeling of discomfort) and fullness are different and should be distinguished by their severity. </p>
<p>In severe cases, there is a sensation of distension that feels like fullness, indicating a true evil, and one must use purgative methods. In mild cases, there is simply a lack of appetite, an inability to discern hunger and fullness, a sensation that resembles distension but is not true distension; rather, it is &quot;pí&quot; qi, or stagnant energy, which is not actual fullness. This may arise from either an evil force invading the chest or from the spleen being weak and failing to move properly. The patient may not understand this distinction and may simply feel that their stomach qi is not activated, resulting in a lack of food intake, stating they feel a sense of fullness and discomfort, when in fact, there is no true distension or fullness.<a id="trans-283p" href="#orig-283p" class="marker">[283p]</a><br>This exists between the suspicion of emptiness and the suspicion of fullness. If one does not discern the truth, they may inevitably misapply tonics or purgatives, leading to considerable harm. Nowadays, many people suffer from deficiencies, so supplementation is necessary. However, the methods of supplementation should not be rushed. To determine whether it is appropriate to supplement or not, one must first assess the condition of the chest and abdomen, and then proceed gradually. If the illness has not advanced, one can use stronger measures without concern. This is the significant principle of supplementation.</p>
<p>In cases of deficiency that are urgent, tonic agents cannot afford to be administered slowly. It is essential to first inquire about the state of the chest; only then can one advance the treatment swiftly. If the vital energy is truly deficient and the chest and abdomen are bloated, this indicates a true deficiency that cannot accept supplementation. If one forcefully administers tonics, it will not only be ineffectual but is likely to invite criticism. Thus, the condition of the chest and abdomen must not be neglected.<a id="trans-284p" href="#orig-284p" class="marker">[284p]</a></p>
<h3>Inquiry on Deafness</h3>
<p>Although the ear is associated with the lesser yang channel, it is essentially the organ of the kidneys and the gathering point of the ancestral vessels. Inquiry into it not only allows for discernment between deficiency and excess, but also reveals matters of life and death. For those who have been deaf for a long time, the closure of this channel is not surprising. However, for those who become deaf due to illness, it is crucial to make a distinction. As mentioned in the Treatise on Heat Disorders: &quot;After three days of cold damage, the lesser yang suffers, resulting in deafness.&quot; This occurs because cold pathogens obstruct the channel and obstruct the qi. Nevertheless, through my observations, there has been no case that did not arise from qi deficiency.</p>
<p>The Suwen states: &quot;When essence is depleted, deafness ensues.&quot; Zhang Zhongjing noted: &quot;In cases of deafness with no hearing, it is due to yang qi deficiency.&quot; From this perspective, of all diseases, those that are due to qi deficiency account for nine out of ten, while those resulting from qi obstruction comprise one out of ten. </p>
<p>Deafness can vary in severity; mild cases correspond to less severe illness, while severe cases indicate more serious conditions. If treatment leads to gradual alleviation, one can observe the gradual recovery of the illness; if it progresses, the disease also advances. If the condition reaches an extreme state of deafness, such that there is complete loss of hearing, this indeed corresponds to the depletion of essence; I have encountered several such cases, all of which were beyond treatment.<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a><br><strong>Inquiring About Thirst</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about thirst or lack of thirst allows one to discern the internal conditions of cold and heat, and the differences between deficiency and excess can also be observed. When there is significant internal heat, there will be great thirst. This is characterized by a preference for cold water that does not cease, while the abdomen feels hard and constipated, and the pulse is strong and robust; this indicates a yang condition. When the mouth is thirsty but prefers warmth over cold, this is not a fire condition, and the presence of internal cold can be determined. If it is not a fire condition, what causes thirst? It is because of a deficiency of water. </p>
<p>When a patient is asked if they are thirsty and replies that their mouth is dry, but when asked if they want soup or water, they say they do not desire it. This indicates that there is no pathogenic fire within, which is why they do not crave soup or water; true yin is deficient, leading to a lack of saliva in the mouth. This is dry mouth, not thirst. One should not treat dryness as if it were thirst.</p>
<p>When yang pathogens are strong but true yin is also deficient, one should not hastily conclude that because there is a strong fire preference for cold, it can be termed as “true heat.” The internal water is insufficient, seeking external water to remedy it. When water is depleted and essence is lacking, the yin becomes desiccated, which must be carefully examined alongside the pulse signs. A slight mistake here can determine life or death. </p>
<p>I often treat patients in critical condition with severe febrile diseases who exhibit these symptoms. In such cases, I frequently use potent nourishing remedies in conjunction with cold water or alternate with ice water and cooked remedies, which has preserved many lives. Most people find it remarkable, not realizing that this approach is grounded in principles. However, only those with severe dryness and constipation may be treated with cold water; if there is no solid obstruction, one should not give water.<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a><br><strong>Body Examination and Verification</strong><br><strong>(Qing Dynasty, Li Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>The four methods of diagnosing illnesses are observation, listening, questioning, and pulse-taking. Observing colors, listening to sounds, and feeling the pulse have been repeatedly emphasized by ancient scholars. However, the art of inquiry to acquire knowledge about illnesses has not been thoroughly developed by earlier philosophers, leaving some doubts. Why is that? When visiting a patient, asking about diarrhea to understand diarrhea, or inquiring about chills and fevers to grasp their nature, is rather superficial. This cannot be the intent of ancient wisdom. </p>
<p>One must ask when the illness began: if it started recently, it is often a new illness characterized by substantial signs; if it began a long time ago, it is likely a chronic condition featuring more signs of deficiency. </p>
<p>What food has been consumed? For instance, if ice was eaten leading to illness, apply treatments that involve ice. If there was an injury caused by meat, use herbs like cardamom or hawthorn. </p>
<p>Have there been experiences of anger, overexertion, or sexual desire? Anger damages the liver, overexertion injures the original energy, and sexual desire harms the kidneys. </p>
<p>Lastly, inquire about the initial symptoms; for example, if the initial presentation includes headache, fever, and aversion to cold, it pertains to an external pathogen.<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a><br>If there are initial symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, they belong to internal injury. What diseases might follow? If dysentery turns to diarrhea or malaria, it is mild; if malaria turns to diarrhea or dysentery, it is severe. If shortness of breath comes before bloating, the issue is in the lungs; if bloating comes before shortness of breath, the issue is in the spleen. If thirst precedes vomiting, it indicates water retention.</p>
<p>Is there a desire to drink? If there is no thirst, it indicates the absence of inner heat; if there is thirst and a desire to drink, it indicates heat. In the elderly, if there is thirst without a desire to drink, it suggests a deficiency of body fluids. If one desires to rinse with water but not swallow it, it indicates blood stagnation and dryness of the yin.</p>
<p>Do you prefer heat or cold? Preference for heat indicates internal cold, while preference for cold indicates internal heat.</p>
<p>Is there a bitter or bland taste in the mouth? Bitter indicates heat; salty indicates cold; bland indicates deficiency; sweet indicates heat in the spleen leading to sores; sour indicates food damage.</p>
<p>Is there a desire for food? If food damage leads to no desire for food, and if there is a mixed symptom with a desire for food, it indicates the presence of stomach qi; otherwise, without stomach qi, it would lead to death.<a id="trans-288p" href="#orig-288p" class="marker">[288p]</a><br>Is there a sense of openness in your chest? If not, it indicates the presence of phlegm accumulation and qi stagnation. </p>
<p>Are there painful areas in your abdomen? If there are no painful areas, this suggests the illness is not internal and indicates deficiency. If there are painful areas, pressing on them alleviates the pain, which indicates deficiency. </p>
<p>Is your urination and defecation normal? If urination is yellow and constipated, it indicates heat; if it&#39;s clear, it indicates cold; and if muddy, it indicates damp heat descending. Constipation indicates excess and heat, while loose stools indicate deficiency. Sudden diarrhea or dysentery indicates excess, while prolonged diarrhea or dysentery indicates deficiency. Yellow and red stools indicate heat, while clear and white stools indicate cold. </p>
<p>Are your feet cold or warm? Warm feet indicate yang, while cold feet indicate yin. Alternating between cold and warm suggests yang, while normal bowel movements suggest deficiency. </p>
<p>How about your routine of work and rest, your emotions of joy, anger, worry, and thoughts, as well as your appetite? Work leads to dispersal of qi, while rest leads to stagnation of qi.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br>Joy harms the heart, anger harms the liver, worry harms the liver, thought harms the spleen, and fear harms the kidneys. Enjoying rich flavors leads to phlegm, and drinking fine wine causes internal heat. Various questions are indeed the shortcut for the living. However, to exhaust the ancient knowledge through questioning alone is still insufficient. In a state of calm, I seem to gain some insights. The ailments of modern people, such as cough, fever, and diarrhea, are collectively named illnesses. Within one condition, there can be elements of heat and cold, phlegm and qi, deficiency and excess, leading to different origins of symptoms. For example, if a cough indicates a heat condition, then one treats it as such; if there is phlegm and qi, then treat it as phlegm and qi. Hence, through questioning, one seeks to identify the origins of the illness rather than just its name, which should align with the ancient wisdom. In the past, Master Danxi was renowned through the ages, yet he merely differentiated the conditions of cold, heat, deficiency, excess, phlegm, fire, blood, and qi for tailored treatments. Is this not the insight of someone exceptional, who sees through the organs? Ultimately, it is through questioning the symptoms that one comes to know them.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　治病先观形色然后察脉问证论<br>　　经曰：诊脉之道，观人勇怯、肌肉、皮肤，能知其情，以为诊法也。凡人之形，长不及短，大不及小，肥不及瘦。人之色白不及黑，嫩不及苍，薄不及厚。而况肥人湿多，瘦人火多，白者肺气虚，黑者肾气足。形色既殊，脏腑亦异，外证虽同，治法迥别。所以肥人责脉浮，瘦人责脉沉，躁人疑脉缓，缓人疑脉躁，以其不可一概观也。试陈一二，可以例推。东阳陈子，露筋，体稍长，患体虚而劳，头痛甚至有决别之言。余察其脉，弦而大带数，以人参、白朮为君，川藭、陈皮为佐。至五六日未减，众人皆讶之，以药之不对也。余曰：药力有次第矣，更少俟一二宿，当自安。忽其季来问曰：何不少加黄芪？予笑不答。<a id="orig-170p" href="#trans-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>又经一宿，忽自言病顿愈。予脉之，觉指下稍盛。又半日，病者言膈上满，不觉饥；视其腹纹已隐矣。予曰：夜来药中莫加黄芪否？曰：然。止与三贴，遂速与二陈汤加厚朴、枳壳、黄连以泻其卫，三贴而安。又浦江义门陈兄，年二十余，秋间大发热，口渴，妄言妄见，病似邪鬼。七八日后，召我治。脉之，两手洪数而实，视其形肥，面赤带白，却喜露筋，脉本不实，凉药所致。此因劳倦成病，与温补药自安。曰：已服柴胡七八贴矣。予以黄芪附子汤，冷与之饮。三贴后，困倦鼾睡，微汗而解，脉亦稍软。继以黄芪白朮汤。至十日，脉渐收敛而小。又与半月而安。夫黄芪补气药也，此两人者一则气虚，一则气实，便有宜不宜存焉，可不审乎？<a id="orig-171p" href="#trans-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>　　　　外科精义 【元　齐德之】</p>
<p>　　　　　论荣卫色脉参应之法</p>
<p>　　夫天地之道曰阴与阳，在人曰血与气。盖血者荣也，气者卫也，荣者荣于中，卫者卫于外，所以荣行脉中，卫行脉外。脉者，血气之先也，血非脉，则焉能荣于中？气非脉，则焉能卫于外？二者相资而行，内则通于五脏六腑，十二经络，外则濡于九窍四肢，百节毫毛，昼夜循行，如环无端，以成其度，会于寸口，变见于脉。故曰：气血者，人之神也；脉者，气血之神也。所以治病之始，五决为纪。盖五决者，五脏之色脉也。脉应于内，色应于外，其色之与脉，当相参应。故曰：能合色脉，可以万全也。凡为医先须调明色脉，若于此不精，虽聪慧辩博，亦不足委也。<a id="orig-172p" href="#trans-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>　　　　医学入门 【明　李梴】</p>

<p>　　　　　问诊</p>
<p>　　凡诊病之法，固莫妙于脉。然有病脉相符者，有病脉相左者，此中大有元理。故凡值疑似难明处，必须用四诊之法，详问其病由，兼辨其声色，但于本末先后中，正之以理，斯得其真。若不察此，而但谓一诊可凭，信手乱治，亦岂知脉证最多真假，见有不确，安能无误？且常诊者知之犹易，初诊者决之甚难。此四诊之所以不可忽也。故《难经》以切居四诊之末，其意深矣。陶节庵亦曰：问病以知其外，察脉以知其内，全在活法二字，乃临证切脉之要诀也。此义惟汪石山言之最详。<a id="orig-274p" href="#trans-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a><br>　　　　　问寒热</p>
<p>　　问寒热者，问内外之寒热，欲以辨其在表在里也。人伤于寒，则病为热。故凡病身热脉紧，头疼体痛，拘急无汗，而且得于暂者，必外感也。盖寒邪在经，所以头疼身痛；邪闭皮毛，所以拘急发热。若素日无疾，而忽见脉证若是者，多因外感。盖寒邪非素所有而突然若此，此表证也。若无表证，而身热不解，多属内伤。然必有内证相应，合而参之，自得其真。　　凡身热经旬，或至月余不解，亦有仍属表证者。盖因初感寒邪，便作身热头痛。医不能辨，误认为火，辄用寒凉，以致邪不能散，或虽经解散而药未及病，以致留蓄在经，其病必外证多而里证少。此非里也，仍当解散。　　凡内证发热者，多属阴虚，或因积热。然必有内证相应，而其来也渐。盖阴虚者必伤精，伤精者必连脏。<a id="orig-275p" href="#trans-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a><br>故其在上而连肺者，必为喘急咳嗽；在中而连脾者，或妨饮食，或生懊憹，或为躁烦焦渴；在下而连肾者，或精血遗淋，或二便失节。然必寒热往来，时作时止，或气怯声微，是皆阴虚证也。　　凡怒气七情，伤肝伤脏而为热者，总属真阴不足，所以邪火易炽，亦阴虚也。　　凡劳倦伤脾而发热者，以脾阴不足，故易于伤。伤则热生于肌肉之分，亦阴虚也。　　凡内伤积热者，在症痞必有形证，在血气必有明征，或九窍热于上下，或脏腑热于三焦。若果因实热，凡火伤在形体而无涉于真元者，则其形气声色脉候，自然壮丽，无弗有可据而察者，此当以实火治之。　　凡寒证尤属显然，或外寒者阳亏于表，或内寒者火衰于中，诸如前证。但热者多实，而虚热者最不可误；寒者多虚，而实寒者间亦有之。此寒热之在表在里，不可不辨也。<a id="orig-276p" href="#trans-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a><br>　　　　　问汗</p>
<p>　　问汗者，亦以察表里也。凡表邪盛者，必无汗。而有汗者，邪随汗去，已无表邪，此理之自然也。故有邪尽而汗者，身凉热退，此邪去也。有邪在经而汗在皮毛者，此非真汗也。有得汗后，邪虽稍减而未得全尽者，犹有余邪，又不可因汗而必谓其无表邪也，须因脉证而详察之。　　凡温暑等证，有因邪而作汗者，有虽汗而邪未去者，皆表证也。总之表邪未除者，在外则连经，故头身或有疼痛；在内则连脏，故胸膈或生躁烦。在表在里，有证可凭；或紧或数，有脉可辨。须察其真假虚实，孰微孰甚而治之。　　凡全非表证，则或有阳虚而汗者，须实其气；阴虚而汗者，须益其精；火盛而汗者，凉之自愈；过饮而汗者清之可宁。此汗证之阴阳表里，不可不察也。诸汗证详载伤寒门，此不赘。<a id="orig-277p" href="#trans-277p" class="marker">[277p]</a><br>　　　　　问头身</p>
<p>　　问其头，可察上下。问其身，可察表里。头痛者邪居阳分，身痛者邪在诸经。前后左右，阴阳可辨；有热无热，内外可分。但属表邪，可散之而愈也。　　凡火盛于内而为头痛者，必有内应之证，或在喉口，或在耳目，别无身热恶寒在表等候者，此热盛于上，病在里也。察在何经，宜清宜降，高者抑之，此之谓也。若用轻扬散剂，则火必上升而痛愈甚矣。　　凡阴虚头痛者，举发无时，是因酒色过度，或遇劳苦，或逢情欲，其发则甚。此为里证，或精或气，非补不可也。　　凡头痛属里者，多因于火，此其常也。然亦有阴寒在上，阳虚不能上达而痛甚者。其证则恶寒呕恶，六脉沉微或兼弦细。诸治不效，余以桂、附、参、熟之类而愈之。是头痛之有阳虚也。　　凡云头风者，此世俗之混名，然必有所因，须求其本，辨而治之。<a id="orig-278p" href="#trans-278p" class="marker">[278p]</a><br>　　凡眩运者，或头重者，可因之以辨虚实。盖病中眩运者，多因清阳不升，上虚而然。如丹溪云：无痰不作运，殊非真确之论。但当兼形气，分久暂以察之。观《内经》曰：上虚则眩，上盛则热痛，其义可知。至于头重，尤属上虚。经曰：上气不足，脑为不满，头为之苦倾。此之谓也。　　凡身痛之甚者，亦当察其表里以分寒热。其若感寒作痛者，或上或下，原无定所，随散而愈，此表邪也。若有定处，而别无表证，乃痛痹之属，邪气虽亦在经，此当以里证视之，但有寒热之异耳。若因火盛者，或肌肤灼热，或红肿不消，或内生烦渴，必有热证相应，治宜以清以寒。若并无热候而疼痛不止，多属阴寒，以致血气凝滞而然。经曰：痛者寒气多也，有寒故痛也，必温其经使血气流通，其邪自去矣。　　凡劳损病剧，而忽加身痛之甚者，此阴虚之极，不能滋养筋骨而然。营气惫矣，无能为也。<a id="orig-279p" href="#trans-279p" class="marker">[279p]</a><br>　　　　　问二便</p>
<p>　　二便为一身之门户，无论内伤外感，皆当察此以辨其寒热虚实。盖前阴通膀胱之道，而其利与不利，热与不热，可察气化之强弱。凡患伤寒而小水利者，以太阳之气未剧，即吉兆也。后阴开大肠之门，而其通与不通，结与不结，可察阳明之虚实。凡大便热结而腹中坚满者，方属有余，通之可也。若新近得解而不甚干结，或旬日不解而全无胀意者，便非阳明实邪。观仲景曰：大便先硬后溏者，不可攻。可见后溏者虽有先硬，已非实热。矧夫纯溏而连日得后者，又可知也。若非真有坚燥痞满等证，则原非实邪，其不可攻也明矣。　　凡小便但见其黄，便谓是火。而不知人逢劳倦，小水即黄。焦思多虑，小水亦黄。泻痢无期，小水亦黄。酒色伤阴，小水亦黄。<a id="orig-280p" href="#trans-280p" class="marker">[280p]</a><br>使非有或淋或痛，热证相兼，不可因黄便谓之火。余见逼枯汁而毙人者多矣。经曰：中气不足，溲便为之变，义可知也。若小水清利者，知里邪之未甚，而病亦不在气分。以津液由于气化。气病则小水不利也。小水渐利，则气化可知，最为吉兆。　　大便通水谷之海，肠胃之门户也。小便通血气之海，冲任水道之门户也。二便皆主于肾，本为元气之关，必真见实邪，方可议通议下。否则，最宜详察审慎，不可误攻。使非真实而妄逐之，导去元气，则邪之在表者，反乘虚而深陷。因内困者必由泻而愈亏。所以凡病不足，慎勿强通，最喜者小便得气而自化，大便弥固者弥良，营卫既调，自将通达，即大肠秘结旬余，何虑之有？若滑泄不守，乃非虚弱者所宜，当首先为之防也。<a id="orig-281p" href="#trans-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a><br>　　　　　问饮食</p>
<p>　　问饮食者，一可察胃口之清浊，二可察脏腑之阴阳。病由外感而食不断者，知其邪未及脏，而恶食不恶食者可知。病因内伤而食饮变常者，辨其味有喜恶，而爱冷爱热者可知。素欲温热者，知阴脏之宜暖；素好寒冷者，知阳脏之可清。或口腹之失节，以致误伤，而一时之权变可因以辨。故饮食之性情所当详察，而药饵之宜否，可因以推也。　　凡诸病得食稍安者，必是虚证。得食更甚者，或虚或实皆有之。当辨而治之也。<a id="orig-282p" href="#trans-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a><br>　　　　　问胸</p>
<p>　　胸即膻中，上连心肺，下通脏腑。胸腹之病极多，难以尽悉。而临证必当问者，为欲辨其有邪无邪，及宜补宜泻也。凡胸腹胀满，则不可用补；而不胀不满，则不可用攻。此大法也。然痞与满不同，当分轻重。重者胀塞中满，此实邪也，不得不攻。轻者但不欲食，不知饥饱，似胀非胀，中空无物，乃痞气耳，非真满也。此或以邪陷胸中者有之，或脾虚不运者有之。病者不知其辨，但见胃气不开，饮食不进，问之亦曰饱闷，而实非真有胀满。<a id="orig-283p" href="#trans-283p" class="marker">[283p]</a><br>此在疑虚疑实之间，若不察其真确，未免补泻倒施，必多致误，则为害不小。　　今人病虚证者极多，非补不可。但用补之法，不宜造次。欲察其可补不可补之机，则全在先察胸腹之宽否何如，然后以渐而进；如未及病，再为放胆用之，庶无所碍。此用补之大法也。　　凡虚证势在危急，补剂难容少缓。亦必先问其胸宽者乃可骤进。若元气真虚，而胸腹又胀，是必虚不受补之证。若强进补剂，非惟无益，适足以招谤耳。此胷腹之不可不察也。<a id="orig-284p" href="#trans-284p" class="marker">[284p]</a><br>　　　　　问聋</p>
<p>　　耳虽少阳之经，而实为肾脏之官，又为宗脉之所聚，问之非惟可辨虚实，亦且可知死生。凡人之久聋者，此一经之闭无足为怪。惟是因病而聋者，不可不辨。其在热论篇则曰：伤寒三日，少阳受之，故为耳聋。此以寒邪在经，气闭而然。然以余所验，则未有不因气虚而然者。《素问》曰：精脱者耳聋。仲景曰：耳聋无闻者，阳气虚也。由此观之，则凡病是证，其属气虚者什九，气闭者什一耳。　　其聋有轻重，轻者病轻，重者病重。若随治渐轻，可察其病之渐退也；进则病亦进矣。若病至聋极，甚至绝然无闻者，此诚精脱之证，余经历者数人矣，皆至不治。<a id="orig-285p" href="#trans-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a><br>　　　　　问渴</p>
<p>　　问渴与不渴，可以察里证之寒热，而虚实之辨亦从以见。凡内热之甚，则大渴。喜冷水不绝，而腹坚便结，脉实气壮者，此阳证也。　　凡口虽渴而喜热不喜冷者，此非火证，中寒可知。既非火证，何以作渴？则水亏故耳。　　凡病人问其渴否，则曰口渴；问其欲汤水否，则曰不欲。盖其内无邪火，所以不欲汤水；真阴内亏，所以口无津液。此口干也，非口渴也。不可以干作渴治。　　凡阳邪虽盛而真阴又虚者，不可因其火盛喜冷，便云实热。盖其内水不足，欲得外水以济。水涸精亏，其阴枯也，必兼脉证细察之。此而略差，死生立判。余常治垂危最重伤寒，有如此者，每以峻补之剂浸冷而服，或以冰水参熟等剂相间迭进，活人多矣。常人见之，咸以为奇，不知理当如是，何奇之有？然必其干渴燥结之甚者，乃可以参附凉水并进；若无实结，不可与水。<a id="orig-286p" href="#trans-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a><br>　　　　身经通考 【清　李潆】</p>

<p><strong>Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The heart is associated with the vessels and its glory is reflected in color; it governs the kidneys. [Note: The heart controls the blood vessels, hence its connection to the pulse. The classics state: the pulse emerges from the qi outlet, and color is seen in the brightness of the hall. The heart&#39;s radiance manifests on the face, thus its glory is in color. The five organs correspond to the five elements, each has its mutual generation and control, with control leading to transformation. The heart governs fire and is constrained by the water of the kidneys; therefore, the kidneys are the primary source of the heart&#39;s generation, hence it governs the kidneys.]</p>
<p>The lungs are related to the skin and their glory is in the hair; they govern the heart. [Note: The lungs govern qi, which governs the exterior, hence their relation to the skin. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: a slow pulse at the wrist means the yang qi is prolonged. The sound is harmonious, and the hair grows long. Hair is attached to the skin; when qi is abundant, the hair flourishes.]</p>
<p>The liver is associated with the tendons, and its glory is in the claws; it governs the lungs. [Note: The marrow produces the liver, and the liver produces the tendons, hence the connection is in the tendons. The claws are extensions of the tendons, thus their glory is in the claws.]</p>
<p>The spleen is related to the flesh, and its glory is in the lips; it governs the liver. [Note: The spleen governs the central earth and is responsible for storage and nourishment. It governs the transformation of the essence of food and water to nourish the flesh, hence its relation to flesh. The spleen opens into the mouth, therefore its glory is in the lips.]</p>
<p>The kidneys are associated with the bones, and their glory is in the hair; they govern the spleen. [Note: The kidneys store essence and govern the marrow, hence the connection is in the bones.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

The discussion of the five phases states: the north produces cold, cold produces water, water produces salt, and salt produces the kidneys. The kidneys produce bone marrow, marrow produces the liver. The liver produces tendons, tendons produce the heart. The heart produces blood, blood produces the spleen. The spleen produces flesh, flesh produces the lungs. The lungs produce skin and hair, and skin and hair produce the kidneys. This is how heaven generates water and how the five organs mutually generate each other. </p>
<p>As for the energies of the five organs, the colors manifest as follows: blue like grass indicates death, yellow like the fruit of the bitter orange indicates death, black like soot indicates death, red like stagnant blood indicates death, and white like withered bones indicates death. These represent the five colors of death. </p>
<p>The five flavors are stored in the intestines and stomach to nourish the energies of the five organs. Within the five organs are the five spirits and five energies, which are externally manifested as five colors. If the energies of the five organs are injured, the deterioration of the five elements becomes apparent. The shade of grass indicates death takes on a blue hue with a hint of white; the bitter orange indicates a yellow shade with a tinge of green; soot, which is smoky dust, appears black with a hint of yellow; stagnant blood, which is congealed and foul, appears red-black; and withered bones are dead white and dried up. The five colors become dry and each bears colors that prevail over others, indicating death.</p>
<p>Conversely, blue like emerald feathers signifies life, red like a rooster&#39;s comb signifies life, yellow like a crab&#39;s belly signifies life, white like pig fat signifies life, and black like crow feathers signifies life. These are the five colors that indicate life. </p>

Therefore, white corresponds to the skin, red to the arteries, blue to the tendons, yellow to the flesh, and black to the bones.</p>
<p>(Note: The correspondence of colors and flavors to the five organs signifies an external manifestation and an internal essence.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ability to discern color and pulse can lead to completeness. [Note: This refers to diagnosing the conditions of the five organs by observing the pulse and color. A slight imbalance indicates deficiency of the vital energy, while a significant imbalance signifies excess of pathogenic energy; a slippery pulse indicates a blood injury, while a choppy pulse suggests insufficient energy; a floating pulse indicates an external issue in the bowels, while a deep pulse suggests an internal issue in the organs. These six types serve as key guidelines for differentiating pulses. The five organs exist internally, but their manifestations appear externally; thus, one can infer and categorize them according to the principles of the five elements. The correspondence between the five organs and the five sounds, which produce voice, can be consciously understood. The subtle observation of the five colors reveals insight, allowing internal examination through the eyes. By accurately assessing the correspondence of color and pulse to distinguish between life and death in diseases, one achieves completeness without error.]</p>
<p>In general, regarding the unusual pulses of the five colors: a yellow face with green eyes, a yellow face with red eyes, a yellow face with white eyes, and a yellow face with black eyes all indicate survival. [Note: Unusual pulses refer to the colors of the extraordinary vessels, the Chong and Ren, which are like the sea of blood and return to the liver, reflecting externally in the eyes. The face indicates the energy color, while the eyes indicate the blood color. When all five colors are present with a yellow face, it signifies the yin of the five organs while reflecting the yang of the stomach.]</p>
<p>A blue face with red eyes, a red face with white eyes, a blue face with black eyes, a black face with white eyes, and a red face with green eyes all indicate death. [Note: The classic text states: A person without stomach energy will die. The absence of yellow on the face indicates a lack of the stomach&#39;s earthly yang. The blue, black, and red colors on the face signify that the organ&#39;s evil energy has taken over the yang; being completely yin without yang leads to death. Life manifests in the heart as if wrapped in white with red; this relates to the colors of the five organs in vitality.

<p>Qi Bo said: The colors and pulses are esteemed by the Supreme Deity and were transmitted by the Ancients. The path of colors and pulses is a secret held by the Supreme Deity, and it is taught only to those worthy and truly committed. The Ancients employed Jiao Dai Ji to interpret colors and pulses, communicating with the divine, integrating them with metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, not deviating from their constants. </p>
<p>The eight winds refer to the celestial eight winds, while in humans, they correspond to the five meridian winds, which regulate the evils of the five pulses. This indicates that the Ancient Masters, through the management of colors and pulses, communicated with the divine, fundamentally encompassing the constants of heaven and earth, yin and yang, four seasons, and five elements. </p>
<p>Transformation occurs in mutual exchange to observe its subtleties and to understand its essentials. To know the essentials, it can only be the colors and pulses. The color represents the essence of Qi, and the pulse is the fluid of essence. The transformation and exchange refer to the transformation of essence into Qi. Observing this transformation of essence and Qi leads to the subtleties of divine communication.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of the Jade Tablet Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Facial coloration appears in various directions—up, down, left, and right—each has its significance. If the coloration is shallow, the treatment involves medicinal soups, which take ten days. If it appears deep, then must be treated with balanced toxins, which take twenty-one days. If the color is profoundly deep, it requires brewed wine for treatment, lasting one hundred days. If the complexion is pale and detached, no treatment is possible, with complete decline in one hundred days. A short pulse with no breath signifies death.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The peculiar and chronic diseases arise from within the five organs, with their energy and coloration manifesting externally in the facial area according to its depth and fluctuation. Shallow colors indicate minor ailments, thus treated with soups that can restore within ten days. The principle of peculiar and chronic conditions is that all five organs draw energy from the stomach, with the spleen facilitating this transfer. When ill, the energy reverses and reflects on the face, hence the use of soups for treatment. This is based on the idea that the liquid from rice helps regenerate the earth&#39;s energies, completing one cycle in ten days to restore the energy of the five organs. Deep colors indicate deeper ailments, thus necessitating the use of powerful detoxifying medicines. The number twenty is the completion of even numbers, while one represents the beginning of life. Following another cycle of ten, one reaches a point of transformation. The five organs are yin, while the energy and color represent yang; after twenty-one days, the vital energy of the five organs has returned. Profoundly deep colors indicate even more serious illnesses.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

When consumed with alcohol, the protective energy first travels through the skin, then fills the meridians, allowing the nourishing and protective energies to circulate, thus dispersing the adverse colors. If the color is very dark, it could take ten times before it ceases. The so-called colors are manifestations that emerge from changes in the five organs, reflecting in the five colors. The energy of the five organs thrives in the meridians, and the meridians corresponding to the five energies become visible as colors.

When the energy of the Sun Meridian is exhausted, the tendons become tense, leading to eye symptoms, reversal, and pulling in the limbs. The hand of the Sun Meridian governs fluids. The bladder is where fluids are stored. If sweat ceases, fluids are lost externally. A white color indicates a loss of blood. If fluids are lost externally, blood is lost internally.</em></p>

<p><em>Commentary: The Lesser Yang governs the bones, and all joints relate to the bones. As the energy of the Lesser Yang ends, all joints relax. The text states: the Lesser Yang is where bone diseases arise, resulting in pain in all joints. The pulses of the hands and feet of the Lesser Yang reach the eyes; thus, the eyes appear startled and gaze askew. The disconnection refers to the eyes losing their connection. The Lesser Yang is associated with the kidneys, which store willpower; if the connection is broken, willpower first dissipates, leading to one and a half days of near death. The blue color indicates the escape of wood energy, while the white indicates a loss of inner nourishment from the Triple Burner. Yang emerges from Yin, and colors arise from energies; hence, as the energies of the six meridians conclude, colors manifest first.</em></p>

<p>The heart’s brilliance is reflected in the face; if the face is black, it indicates an overabundance of water energy, extinguishing fire energy and leading to a loss of vitality. Long and dirt-covered teeth signify an excess in bone essence. Bloated abdomen with obstruction indicates that the energies of the heart and kidneys have both ceased, preventing proper exchange above and below.</p>
<p>In the case of Taiyin endings, the abdomen becomes bloated and obstructed, with difficulty in breathing, and there are tendencies towards belching and vomiting.

<p>The Foot Taiyin channel enters the abdomen, belonging to the spleen, hence causing abdominal bloating. The Hand Taiyin channel ascends to the diaphragm, belonging to the lungs and governing respiration, resulting in difficulty in breathing.

When there is no reflux, there is blockage within, hence obstruction above and below. If spleen energy declines, it cannot control water, causing black coloration to appear on the face.

Red should be like pure white wrapped in crimson, not like ochre; white should be like goose feathers, not like salt; green should be like the luster of a blue jade, not like blue; yellow should be like the powder of orpiment wrapped in silk, not like yellow earth; black should be like heavy lacquer, not like the color of black earth. The subtle manifestations of the five colors are seen externally, their longevity is not long.</p>
<p>The essence of the five organs lies hidden. When the true colors of the five organs become visible and are not concealed, their longevity is short. The essence and brightness are what allow one to perceive all things, distinguish between white and black, and discern short from long. If one takes the long for short, and white for black, then the essence deteriorates.</p>
<p>The head is the organ of clarity; if the head tilts and the gaze is deep, the spirit will be lost. The back is an organ in the chest; if the back curves and the shoulders follow, the organ will be damaged. The waist is an organ of the kidneys; if it twists and cannot stabilize, the kidneys will suffer exhaustion.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

The bone is the marrow&#39;s cavity; it cannot stand for long; when walking, it shakes and will weaken. If strength is gained, one thrives; if strength is lost, one perishes.</p>
<p>(Note: The essence and energy of all Yang converge at the head, and the essence of all marrow gathers in the brain, making the head the cavity of essence, marrow, and spirit. If the sea of marrow is insufficient, the head will droop; if the spirit and energy are weak, the eyes will be sunken. The shoulders and back are associated with Yang, while the chest and abdomen are associated with Yin; Yang represents cavities, and Yin represents organs. The heart and lungs reside in the chest, and the back is related to the chest, as it carries its cavity. The two kidneys are located in the lower back, making the waist the external cavity of the kidneys. The tendon meets at the Yanglingquan point, and the knee is the cavity of the tendons. Stooping and walking with support indicate weakness. Tendons are linked to the liver; when they weaken, it signifies the liver&#39;s essence and energy are depleted. The marrow is stored in the bones, so the bones serve as the cavity for the marrow. If one cannot stand for long, the marrow is exhausted internally; when the marrow is depleted, the bones will weaken. These five aspects require the strength of their cavities to thrive; without strength, the cavities decay, and the organs will perish.)</p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, and if the color is not green, it indicates a problem resulting in a heaviness in the pulse. When blood clots under the left rib, it causes difficulty in breathing. If the pulse is soft and scattered, with color and luster, it signifies a condition related to excessive fluid. Excessive fluid occurs from severe thirst leading to excessive drinking, which easily enters the muscles, skin, and intestines.</p>
<p>(Note: The liver governs blood and color. If the pulse is vigorous yet colorless, it indicates that blood is accumulated below. A condition causing heaviness or injury may arise from being struck on the hand. The blood congealing beneath the ribs consequently leads to breathing difficulties.)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The foot yangming pulse runs from the qi at the thigh down to the foot&#39;s ankle; the pulse is strong and red due to the injury at the thigh. Food enters the stomach and corrupts in the middle jiao; insufficient stomach qi indicates a condition of food obstruction.)</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: &quot;In cases of pre-existing illness causing disturbances in the five organs and affecting the pulse color, how can one recognize the characteristics of a newly manifested disease?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Indeed, it is a good question! When the pulse is small and its color is not depleted, it indicates a new illness; when the pulse is not depleted but its color is depleted, it indicates a chronic illness. When both the pulse and the five colors are depleted, this also indicates a chronic illness; when both the pulse and the five colors are not depleted, it indicates a new illness. If the pulses of the liver and kidney both present, and their color is dark red, this indicates injury or damage without visible blood. If blood is visible, it appears as if wet like water. </p>
<p>(Note: The reference to pre-existing illnesses due to disturbances in the pulse and color suggests a transformation upon encountering a new acute illness. Thus, the Emperor asks this question, and Qibo provides a thorough response. When the illness is longstanding, the pulse and color are affected; hence a small pulse with color not depleted indicates a new illness. The phrase &quot;not depleted but color depleted&quot; implies the disease manifested through the five organs is reflected in the pulse and seen through the color. The decline in the pulse and color is influenced in reverse; the pulse reflects the organs. When both the pulse and the five colors are depleted, it signifies damage to both blood and qi, thus indicating a chronic condition. An acute illness comes from outside to inside, while the damage to color and pulse affects from inside to outside, indicating that when both color and pulse are not depleted, it is recognized as a newly acquired illness. This indicates that in a longstanding illness, the qi of the five organs becomes active before it is reflected in the pulse and color. Damage to muscles and bones causes both the liver and kidney pulses to be present, showing dark red. Absence of visible blood means injury to muscles and bones without affecting the blood. If blood is seen, and the blood is affected, it is akin to an injury to the heart, and the heart pulse will also be present.)<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the arms show many blue veins, it indicates blood loss. If the neck veins throb and there are symptoms of wheezing and coughing, it indicates water retention. If the eyes appear slightly swollen, resembling the appearance of a silkworm lying down, it also indicates water retention. If the urine is yellow and red, and the person can lie down comfortably, this indicates jaundice. If one feels hungry after eating, it indicates stomach jaundice. If the face is swollen, it indicates wind. If the legs and feet are swollen, it indicates water retention. If the eyes are yellow, this indicates jaundice. </p>
<h3>Commentary on the True Organs</h3>
<p>If the major bones are dry and shriveled, and the major muscles have sunken, with fullness of qi in the chest causing difficulty in breathing, this indicates that the symptoms are severe and the person is likely to die within six months. When the pulse of the true organs is observed, it indicates a prognosis. </p>
<p>The major bones refer to the bones of the arms and legs, while the major muscles refer to the muscles of those limbs. The kidneys govern the bones, and the spleen and stomach govern the muscles of the four limbs. The qi of the stomach nourishes the five organs, which is known as the ancestral qi. Ancestral qi accumulates in the chest and is conducted through the deep channels to the twelve meridians. When the meridians are obstructed, this results in qi fullness in the chest. If yangming qi is obstructed, it causes difficulty in breathing. The movement of the qi demonstrates a heart condition that wishes to transmit to the lungs, as the lungs govern qi, leading to increased breath and movement.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the five visceral organs have already deteriorated, their color must be pale, and if so, death is imminent. </p>

<p>One must first assess the heft and slenderness of the form to adjust the balance of its energy. If it is excessive, one must expel it; if it is lacking, one must supplement it. Blood vessels must be addressed before adjustments can be made. Regardless of the ailment, the goal is to achieve equilibrium. </p>
<p>[Note: A person who is overweight has abundant blood and energy, with firm skin; their energy is sluggish and slow, so treatment requires deep and prolonged stimulation. A thin person has thin skin and little color; their blood is clear, and energy is smooth, making them more susceptible to loss of energy and blood; treatment here should be shallow and swift. An excess indicates strong pathogenic influences, while a deficiency signifies a loss of essence. To expel excess, one must confront and remove it; to supplement deficiency, one must pursue and restore it. Addressing blood vessels means removing any stagnations. In any case, treatment must begin by addressing the blood, then relieving the patient&#39;s suffering. Afterward, one can expel excess and replenish deficiency, with no need to question the feasibility of the ailment, as the focus must be on restoring balance and peace in energy before proceeding with needles.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Classic of Needling&quot; states: When the body becomes emaciated due to illness, and the qi overwhelms the form, death follows. When the form overwhelms the qi, danger arises. For a slender form indicates weakened righteous qi. A strong pulse indicates an ingress of pathogenic qi. If there is excess qi in the chest, it means qi is overpowering the form. When qi dominates, it signifies that the pathogenic qi is rampant and the righteous qi is depleted. </p>
<p>Life, as dictated by Heaven, establishes the form and qi, and the harmony between form and qi is essential. If a person&#39;s pupils are prominent, it indicates insufficiency of the sun (yang). If there are sunken eyes, the essence of the sun is already exhausted. This is a critical determinant of life and death, not to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the nine needles and the nine conditions emphasizes the connection between spirit and qi. The heart houses the spirit and is the sun among the yang; the kidneys are the source of vital qi, with the bladder reflecting it. Thus, primarily assessing the sun-like functions of the hands and feet is critical since the sun governs all yang energies. Prominent pupils indicate a deficiency in the spirit of the sun. The pulse of the hand solar channel extends from the cheek to the sharp corner of the eye, and its branches reach from the nose to the inner corners of the eyes. If it is deficient, the channel energy becomes urgent, leading to prominent pupils. </p>
<p>The pulse of the foot solar channel originates from the inner corners of the eyes; when qi is cut off, death is inevitable, thus resulting in sunken eyes. Although the energies of the hand and foot channels in the yang interact and connect, any deficiency in the hand channel stems from the decline of vital qi, manifesting as depletion in the lower body leading to the upper body failing first. Therefore, deficiencies in the upper body should be nourished, while complete cessation in the lower body signifies death. The analogy states that when trees bloom, their leaves sprout, whereas when strings break, their sound becomes hoarse.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A skilled physician says: For illnesses that occur in the Taiyang (greater yang), sweating from the exterior can help relieve heat. When the affliction is within the five organs, if one has not yet shown symptoms but sees a reddish complexion, one should perform acupuncture on those points, which is referred to as treating the unmanifested disease. If one can induce sweating, it is permissible to wait for the right moment. However, if one does not urgently relieve the heat through sweating, the Taiyang heat will intertwine with the internal organ heat, and the pulse of Taiyang will clash with that of Jueyin (lesser yin); the death will not be long in coming, not exceeding three days. </p>
<p>The Shaoyang (lesser yang) is associated with the kidneys, as the energy of Shaoyang originates from the kidneys. Therefore, if a fever relates to the kidneys, it shows in the color of the Shaoyang pulse. The pulse of Shaoyang will display a rosy complexion on the cheeks, indicating heat illness. If the color is not yet combined, we say one can afford to wait for the appropriate time to induce sweating. If the pulse clashes with that of Shaoyin (lesser yin), the death will also be a matter of three days. </p>
<p>Note: The external appearance of the Shaoyang pulse indicates a heat illness of Shaoyang. A rosy complexion on the cheeks is a heat illness of the kidneys. </p>
<p>If the color below the cheeks rises towards the temples, it indicates major stagnation; if it descends to the molars, it signals abdominal fullness; if it rises behind the temples, it indicates lateral flank pain; if it rises on the cheeks, it relates to the upper diaphragm. </p>
<p>Note: If the color below the cheeks rises towards the temples, it shows kidney heat affecting the liver and represents major stagnation. If it descends to the molars, it indicates kidney heat affecting the stomach, which leads to abdominal fullness. If it rises behind the temples, it indicates heat evils affecting the gallbladder, resulting in flank pain. </p>
<p>If the color rises on the cheeks, it indicates issues concerning the heart and lungs above the diaphragm. Therefore, when the heat of the five organs manifests as color in the facial features with the presence of external pathogenic heat, one should treat it before it develops into a full-blown illness, and avoid allowing the internal and external factors to combine, resulting in an irretrievable state of death.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p>Those with water qi will first show slight swelling beneath the eyes. Water represents yin, and the area beneath the eyes is also yin.

<p>[Note: The causes of atrophy are all due to heat in the five organs leading to exhaustion of fluids, which fail to nourish the muscles, veins, bones, and flesh.

<p>[Note: Decayed earth refers to stubborn, collapsed soil. The spleen governs muscles; if it feels like decayed earth and does not yield, it reflects a lack of manifestation of qi. Earth is central and corresponds to the four seasons; if black appears first among the five colors, it indicates that earth has decayed and water energy has taken over. &quot;Decayed&quot; refers to the color white, which corresponds to the spring season. If white decays, it means the wood energy is strong and the energy of decayed earth is completely diminished.]</p>

<p>The yang of the Yangming is referred to as &quot;harmful flying.&quot; The upper and lower parts follow the same principle. If one examines the floating channels within the skin, all belong to the yangming channels. If the color is predominantly green, there is pain; if mostly black, there is numbness; if yellow or red, there is heat; if predominantly white, there is cold. If all five colors are present, it indicates the presence of both cold and heat. If the channels are excessive, they invite pathogens into the meridian. Yang governs the exterior, while yin governs the interior.</p>
<p>[Note: The yang channels of Yangming are referred to as harmful flying. &quot;Flying&quot; denotes movement. Yangming pertains to noon, the time of full yang, akin to the movement of all things. When yang is at its peak and yin energy increases, it is detrimental to the flying movement, hence the name harmful flying. The upper and lower parts follow the same principle, implying that the channels of the hands and feet share this method. Within the region of the skin, one observes that the initial manifestation of pathogens occurs within the skin, followed by the floating channels; if they linger, they later transfer to the meridians. Therefore, examining the floating channels of the skin, if predominantly green, it signifies pain; if mostly black, it indicates numbness; if yellow, there is heat; if white, cold prevails. The presence of all five colors suggests both cold and heat. If the channels are excessive and do not expel the pathogen, it will invade the meridian. In the areas corresponding to Yangming, this leads to ailments of Yangming; in the areas corresponding to Shaoyang, it results in ailments of Shaoyang; in the regions corresponding to the Three Yin, it results in ailments of the Three Yin. Manifestations seen on the skin represent the channels, which are yang and govern the exterior; while those found in the muscles and bones represent the meridians, which are yin and govern the interior. Those conditions of yang can be resolved externally, while those of yin must be approached from within and reside in the organs.]<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p>Therefore, if one fails to address the yin, one cannot attain the yang, leading to extinction. Gaining the yang without the yin results in a lack of profound learning. Knowing the left but not the right, knowing the right but not the left, knowing above but not below, knowing before but not after—this is why governance cannot last. Knowing the ugly, knowing the good, knowing illness, knowing health, knowing the high, knowing the low, knowing sitting, knowing rising, knowing action, knowing stillness. When applied with principles, the diagnosis is thorough, and for countless generations, one remains unthreatened, understanding what is abundant and what is lacking. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The path of diagnosis involves the interplay of yin and yang, and the consideration of left and right, front and back, up and down in theory, as detailed in the precise chapter on pulse. The concepts of ugliness and goodness pertain to the presence of virtue and vice in pulse evidence. Conditions of excess are manifested in action, while those of deficiency tend toward sitting and lying down. Knowing the reasons for abundance allows one to understand the causes of deficiency. By grasping this, one can comprehend others; knowing one leads to knowing ten.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To assess conditions, one must examine the upper and lower parts; the pulse changes due to various factors. Therefore, when the body is weak and the energy is deficient, death occurs. If the body and energy are sufficient but the pulse is insufficient, death will also occur; conversely, if the pulse is sufficient but the body and energy are lacking, life may continue. </p>
<p>This implies that one should first evaluate the communication between the upper and lower parts and then thoroughly investigate the changes in pulse, allowing for an understanding of weak bodies and deficient energy leading to death. Regardless of the stability of the pulse, one must consider the condition of the body and energy to ascertain outcomes. </p>
<p>Thus, diagnosis involves broad principles; there are consistent patterns for sitting and rising. There are rules for movement and entering or exiting, which help to focus the mind. One must observe with clarity and stillness, watching both the upper and lower aspects. There are principles governing the eight categories of health and disease, and distinctions among the five central organs. One should assess the pulse in terms of movement and stillness, considering its quality—such as the smoothness, slipperiness, harshness, coldness, or warmth.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The skin that is smooth and moist is affected by wind; skin that is dry indicates wind obstruction. When the pulse is hot and very restless, this signifies a warm disease; when the pulse is cold and small, it indicates a deficiency of qi. If the skin is initially hot and then cold, this indicates alternating cold and heat; if it starts cold and later becomes hot, this also reflects alternating cold and heat. Therefore, a skilled practitioner does not rely solely on the pulse at the wrist, and a good pulse diagnostician does not depend on color alone. Those who can analyze and synthesize these elements are true masters. </p>
<p>By observing the size of the pulse, one correlates it with the disease&#39;s characteristics. The underlying cause of the condition is the extraordinary and constant ailments. If the signs are contrary, the spirit does not return; if it returns, it does not turn. If one can accurately identify the name of the illness, then the diagnosis can be perfect, without losing sight of human feelings. </p>
<p>Observing the breath means monitoring the incoming and outgoing breathing, as well as the pulse&#39;s ebb and flow. Observing intent involves closing doors and windows to focus on the patient, asking questions to gauge their feelings in accordance with their intentions. Gaining the spirit signifies prosperity, while losing it implies demise. Speaking recklessly leads to the loss of clarity in thought.

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, saying: &quot;I have heard that by observing its color, one can know the illness; this is called &#39;brightness.&#39; By palpating its pulse, one can know the illness; this is called &#39;spirit.&#39; By inquiring about the illness, one can determine its location; this is called &#39;expertise.&#39; I wish to know how to see and understand this, how to palpate and obtain this, how to inquire and fully comprehend it; what should I do?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The color and pulse correspond to the inch (pulse position), just as the impacts of drumsticks correspond. They must not be separated. This is the checking of the roots and leaves of the plant; hence, if the roots die, the leaves will wither. Color, pulse, and form must not be separated. Thus, knowing one leads to expertise, knowing two leads to spirit, and knowing three leads to both spirit and brightness.&quot; The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear the conclusion!&quot; Qi Bo answered: &quot;If the color is blue, the pulse is string-like. If red, the pulse is hook-like. If yellow, the pulse is alternate. If white, the pulse is fine. If black, the pulse is stone-like. If one sees the color but cannot discern the pulse, and mistakenly identifies the pulse that opposes it, it will lead to death; if one finds the pulse that corresponds positively, then the illness is resolved.&quot;<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence and brightness of the five colors are the manifestations of vital energy, arising from the spiritual energies of the five organs and five elements. The pulse is the pathway through which nourishing blood flows. The &quot;寸&quot; refers to the blood and energy outside the pulse, circulating along the channels of the hand’s yangming and manifesting on the skin of the wrist. The internal blood and energy travel through the channels of the hand’s taiyin and manifest at the &quot;寸,&quot; all of which arise from the energy and blood produced by the stomach and organs, reflecting the roots and leaves of life.</p>
<p>The physical body corresponds to the skin of the wrist. Understanding the three elements of color, pulse, and wrist leads to clarity and insight. The colors blue, yellow, red, white, and black correspond to the energies and colors of the five organs and five elements. The terms &quot;弦&quot; (xian) and &quot;钩&quot; (gou) represent the patterns of the pulses of the five organs and elements, reflecting mutual responses like shadows.</p>
<p>Thus, when the color is blue, the pulse is like xian; when red, it resembles gou. Observing the colors reveals the corresponding pulses, uniquely following the path of earth in harmony with heaven. If blue is present but the pulse shows characteristics of &quot;毛&quot; (毛脉), and if red contrasts with the traits of &quot;石&quot; (石脉), this indicates an imbalance of yin and yang, resulting in illness. Conversely, if blue matches with the traits of &quot;石&quot; and red aligns with &quot;代,&quot; this signifies that the color arises from the pulse, yang comes from yin, and the proper way is followed, thus the illness is resolved.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p>When diagnosing the channels and pulses, if the pulse color is blue, it indicates coldness and pain; if red, there is heat. A cold stomach will have many blue lines at the wrists. If there is heat in the stomach, the lines at the base of the thumb will be red. If the color is dark black, it signifies long-lasting stagnation. If there are red, black, and blue colors present, that indicates cold and heat energies. A short blue pulse indicates a lack of energy. For all cases of cold and heat treatment, there are usually many blood vessels involved, which must be addressed every other day, stopping only when the blood is depleted to harmonize deficiency and excess. If the pulse is blue and short, indicating severe lack of energy, draining too much will cause suffocation; if the suffocation is severe, the patient cannot speak, and they will urgently need to sit up.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When diagnosing the vessels and pulses, a blue color indicates cold, while red indicates heat, as the blood and vital energy in the superficial vessels are manifested on the skin. If there is cold in the stomach, the pulse at the hand&#39;s fish region is more blue; if there is heat, it is red. The energy and blood in the skin vessels originate from the stomach organs and flow from the Yangming and Shaoyang channels to the skin at the wrist and up to the fish region. The vital energy comes from the three Yin and three Yang, generated by the stomach organs. If energy is severely lacking, purging may cause agitation, and the energy becomes more deficient and unable to circulate outside. Severe agitation may lead to collapse, rendering a person unable to speak, which indicates that the six energies of Yin and Yang arise from the essence of food and water in the stomach organs, rooted in the primordial water and fire. When the lesser Yin energy becomes obstructed below, it results in collapse and inability to speak, hence in cases of agitation, one should quickly sit up to stimulate the lesser Yin energy, similar to the method of walking gently while wearing heavy shoes with a large stick.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

The Ming Tang is vast, covering many areas, with tall walls and a sturdy foundation, leading to the exterior. Only then can the five colors be regulated.

The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we tell if the flesh is not firm? Shao Yu replied: The hamstring meat is not firm and has no distinct texture. Texture refers to the coarseness; if the texture is coarse and the skin is not tight, then the pores are loose, indicating a harmonious state. </p>
<p>[Note: This means that if the skin is not dense and the muscle texture is coarse and loose, then the wind will invade internally, leading to profuse sweating. The &quot;Wei Zhong&quot; (委中) relates to the Tai Yang part. The Tai Yang energy is dominant in the skin; if the hamstring meat is not firm and lacks distinct texture, then it indicates a coarse texture. If the texture is coarse and the skin is not dense, then the pores are loose, leading to excessive sweating.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know if a person is prone to wasting disorders? Shao Yu replied: If all five organs are soft and weak, then they tend to suffer from wasting disorders. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know the five organs are soft and weak? Shao Yu replied: Softness and weakness must have a foundation of firmness. If one is firm, they can easily become angry, and the soft ones are easily injured.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can one distinguish between the soft and weak and the strong and firm? Shao Yu replied: A person with thin skin and a sturdy heart has a mind that is straight and assertive. When one is strong, they tend to be easily angered; anger causes their energy to rise, accumulating in the chest, where blood and energy stagnate. This leads to a fullness in the flesh, obstructed blood vessels, eventually transforming into heat. When heat arises, it consumes the skin, leading to an affliction known as &quot;xiaozhan.&quot; This reflects a person who is aggressively strong yet has weak muscles. </p>
<p>[Note: Xiaozhan refers to a condition of heat that causes thirst and weight loss. The Classic of Pathogenic Factors states that the subtle pulses of the five organs lead to &quot;xiaozhan.&quot; The five organs are responsible for storing essence. If all five organs are soft and weak, bodily fluids are depleted, making one prone to illness like &quot;xiaozhan.&quot; The physical body is a manifestation of the five organs. When one has thin skin and weak muscles, it indicates that all five organs are indeed soft and weak.]<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The soft and weak must have strength, referring to a frail physique but a strong nature. Therefore, a person with thin skin yet firm and deep-set eyes has a vital force that is vigorous and upright; their heart is strong, and strength often breeds anger. Anger causes the vital energy to rise and blood to accumulate in the chest. When the vital energy remains reversed, it causes coldness in the muscles; when blood accumulates, it obstructs the flow in the veins. When blood and energy stagnate, they turn into heat, and this heat causes the skin to deteriorate, resulting in consumption. This describes a person who is excessively strong yet has weak muscles. Indeed, weak muscles lead to soft organs, and excessive strength causes much anger and rising energy. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can one discern whether a person is prone to cold or heat? Shao Yu answered: Those with thin bones and weak flesh are prone to cold and heat. The Yellow Emperor asked: How do you assess the size of bones, the firmness or fragility of flesh, and the differences in color?

If the skin is thin, the flesh lacks substance, the arms appear weak and delicate, and the color of the complexion is unhealthy and distinct from that of the sky, this is an indication. Those with thin arms have insufficient marrow, hence they are prone to ailments of cold and heat. </p>
<p>(Note: The kidneys govern the bones, and the cheekbones serve as an external indicator of the kidneys. Thus, if the cheekbones are prominent, the bones throughout the body are also large; if they are small, it indicates that the bones are small. The ‘lack of substance’ refers to the fatty tissue of the flesh. Weak and delicate means soft and fragile. Thin arms indicate that the fleshy parts of the thighs and upper arms are not ample. The complexion of the earth signifies that it is not in harmony with the heavenly complexion, which indicates turbid and low energy. The marrow is the essence of the bones; if the bones are small, then the marrow is insufficient. Externally, the skin represents yang, while the muscles and bones represent yin. Small bones and thin skin indicate a deficiency in both yin and yang. A deficiency in yang leads to coldness, while a deficiency in yin leads to heat; thus, those with small bones and thin skin are prone to ailments of cold and heat.)</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can one observe those prone to bi syndromes? Shao Yu replied: Those with coarse texture and insufficiently firm flesh are prone to bi syndromes. The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a differentiation in the severity of bi syndromes? Shao Yu replied: To know the severity, one must observe the respective body areas.</p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;texture&quot; refers to the muscular structure; if it is coarse and not dense, then pathogens will linger and cause bi. The skin, pulse, muscles, and bones represent distinct areas related to the five organs.)<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Treatise on Bi says: Wind, cold, and dampness combine to form Bi. If one encounters this in winter, it is called bone Bi; in spring, it is called muscle Bi; in summer, it is called meridian Bi; in the depths of yin, it is called flesh Bi; and in autumn, it is called skin Bi. Therefore, by observing the different parts, one can determine the severity of Bi. Generally, Bi of the heart and lungs is high, while Bi of the liver, kidneys, and spleen is low.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can one discern the accumulation of disorders within the intestines? Shao Yu replied: When the skin is thin and lacks moisture, and the flesh is weak and unable to retain essence, this causes discomfort in the intestines and stomach. Discomfort allows evil Qi to linger and accumulate, harming the relationship between the spleen and stomach. If temperature is not regulated, and evil Qi gradually manifests, accumulation will arise as a large mass.</p>
<p>Note: When the skin is thin and Qi does not fill the body, the moisture is lacking; thus, discomfort in the intestines and stomach occurs. This arises from the combination of fluids and blood Qi, generated by the intestines and stomach. Discomfort allows evil Qi to linger and form an accumulation, which harms the spleen and stomach. If eating and drinking are not balanced, evil Qi may gradually emerge and lead to significant accumulation. The intestines are connected to the lungs and govern the skin and Qi, while the stomach is tied to the spleen and governs the flesh and fluids. Therefore, when the skin is thin and the flesh weak, it indicates that Qi is not full and the fluids cannot effectively nourish the body. Without adequate Qi and fluids, the pores are open and tend to be loose, causing evil Qi to linger and gradually accumulate in the intestines and stomach.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the heart resides verbal expression, while the lungs govern sound. When the heart and lungs are full, their passages are blocked, leading to feelings of heaviness and forgetfulness, making it difficult to articulate. The texts say: the heart is associated with the surface. Therefore, when the heart is weak, the organs outside become easily injured by cold, and fear manifests in speech. When the heart is strong, the organs are stable and secure; when the heart is weak, it tends to suffer from depletion and heat. This is because the five organs are responsible for storing essence. When the five organs are weak, the bodily fluids are thin, leading to deficiencies in nourishment.</p>
<p>When the heart is correct, spirit and vitality are harmonious and robust, making it hard for illness to inflict harm. When the heart is biased or unsteady, one lacks control and fails to maintain focus. A small lung results in less fluid intake, avoiding coughing or wheezing; a large lung leads to excessive drinking, resulting in chest and throat congestion and adverse energy. When the lung is elevated, breathing difficulty and coughing may arise; when it is situated lower, it can cause pressure on the lungs, leading to pain below the ribs. When the lung is robust, it is immune to coughing difficulties; when it is fragile, it is susceptible to illness and injury. A properly aligned lung fosters balance and resistances to harm; a tilted lung results in pain in the chest.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs govern the regulation of water pathways; therefore, in small amounts, one should drink less, and in large amounts, one should drink more. The lungs are situated in the chest and open to the throat to manage respiration; hence, when the condition is mild, there is no illness like wheezing or coughing, but when it is severe, it can lead to chest and throat obstructions. The lungs are responsible for Qi; thus, when the position is high, the breath rises to the shoulders, causing coughing. The &quot;fen&quot; refers to the entrance of the stomach, located above the stomach&#39;s opening. The lungs are positioned below this entrance, and when the stomach compresses the lungs, it can obstruct the flow of blood vessels, leading to pain beneath the ribs. This area corresponds to the points in the lung meridian, namely &quot;Yunmen&quot; and &quot;Zhongfu.&quot; When the lungs are firm, the Qi does not rebel and cause coughing; when the lungs are fragile, one suffers from illnesses like consumption and is more prone to lung injury. The lungs store Qi, providing a residence for the soul; when the lungs are in good condition, the spirit and mind are harmonious, and external pathogens cannot harm.

A strong kidney does not suffer from back pain; a weak one easily gets diseases like edema. An upright kidney is harmonious and difficult to harm; a slanted kidney leads to back and buttock pain.</p>
<p>Annotations: The organs refer to storage. Therefore, a small organ is secure and hard to harm; a large one tends to cause lumbar pain, as the lower back is associated with the kidneys. The lumbar spine is a major joint in the body, hence pain in the lower back, back pain, and pain in the buttocks makes bending and stretching difficult. The kidneys are situated between the lower back and spine, causing various pains. The fox hernia varies in size and shifts from time to time. The fox symbolizes a yin creature, adept at transformation and concealment. The testicles ascend and descend, resembling the unpredictable movement of a fox; this is the hernia of the kidneys. A strong kidney does not suffer from back pain, while a weak one easily falls prey to diseases like edema. The kidneys store essence, and essence contains intention; if the organ body is upright and proper, the spirit and mind are harmonious and safe from injury; if it is askew, it leads to pain in the lower back and buttocks.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: The five organs arise from the five elements of the earth.

If the color ascends, the illness worsens; if it descends and diffuses like clouds, the illness is easing. Each of the five organs has both external and internal aspects. Colors moving from the outside to the inside indicate the illness shifts from external to internal, while colors moving from inside to outside indicate the illness is moving outward.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Thunder Lord said: &quot;I have heard that wind is the beginning of a hundred ailments, and that reversal is the onset of cold and dampness. How should these be distinguished?&quot; The Yellow Emperor replied: &quot;The constant observation is at the tower; the wind is represented by a thin sheen, and the dampness manifests as turbid. On the ground, it signifies reversal; this is its nature. Each illness is expressed through its color.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The ground refers to the earth platform. Wind is hence linked to meteorological forces, so it is regularly observed in the courtyard. Cold and dampness derive from the energy of the earth, thus they are observed in the earth&#39;s domain. Wind is a Yang evil, hence its color is that of a thin sheen. Cold and dampness are Yin evils, so their color is turbid. This indicates that the evils of wind, cold, and dampness can simultaneously invade the channels and enter the organs, leading to sudden death that cannot be saved. Therefore, the invasion of evil wind occurs as swiftly as wind and rain, becoming the source of a hundred illnesses. Hence, a skilled healer prioritizes treating the skin and hair, followed by the muscles and skin, then the tendons and vessels, and finally the organs. Treating the organs is like being half-dead and half-alive. Thus, one must clarify the divisions, examine both external and internal conditions, and utilize Yin harmonization with Yang, and vice versa, ensuring that evils do not enter the organs and result in irreparable harm. This is what is called a master craftsman, and their effectiveness is unparalleled.)<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

The Yellow Emperor replied: When the great qi enters the organs and vessels, one may die suddenly without illness. The Thunder Prince asked: How can we know when someone who has a minor illness recovers but still dies suddenly? The Yellow Emperor said: If red color appears on both cheeks, as large as a thumb, then even if the minor illness seems to have recovered, death is certain. If black color appears on the forehead, as large as a thumb, that death will certainly occur without illness.</p>
<p>[Note: The great qi entering the organs refers to external evils invading the organs, hence one dies suddenly without illness. &quot;Not ill&quot; indicates there are no external physical symptoms. When someone recovers from a minor illness but still dies suddenly, the internal conditions of the organs accumulate. Red color appearing on both cheeks and black color appearing on the forehead refers to the kidneys affecting the heart, where the heart becomes ill and the kidneys respond in this way. Red relates to the color of fire, while black corresponds to the color of water. Recovery from a minor illness means water nourishes the fire.

Severe pain results in contractions, while intense cold results in insensitive skin. The five colors each show their respective parts; by observing their floating and sinking, one can understand depth, and by examining their clarity and turbidity, one can gauge success and failure. By noting their dispersion and gathering, one can discern distance, and by observing colors vertically and horizontally, one can identify the location of illness. Cultivate the spirit in the heart to know the past and the present. Therefore, observing vital signs is not trivial; without understanding right and wrong, one loses sight of the new and the old.

Cold harms the skin; therefore, in severe cases, it results in insensitivity of the skin.

By observing the fluctuation of colors, one can discern the superficiality or depth of the disease; by examining the luster of colors, one can perceive a person&#39;s successes or failures; by analyzing the dispersal of colors, one can understand the proximity of the illness; and by observing the colors&#39; variations, one can locate the site of the disease. </p>
<p>Accumulating the spirit in the heart allows one to comprehend the past and present, ensuring that one&#39;s perception of qi is not vague, and one knows right from wrong, retaining awareness of the new and the old.

When Qi is injured and pain arises, the condition disperses in the Qi aspect, and the mass has not yet developed in the blood vessels.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor said: How do the winds of the four seasons affect patients? Shao Yu replied: Those with thin, yellow skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of spring; those with thin, white skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of summer; those with thin, green skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of autumn; and those with thin, red skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous wind of winter. The Yellow Emperor asked: What about those with black skin? Shao Yu said: Those with black skin that is thick and the flesh firm are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons. However, if the skin is thin and the flesh not firm, and the colors are not consistent, they will fall ill due to the vacuous wind in the long summer. Those with thick skin and firm flesh will not fall ill due to the vacuous wind in the long summer. Yet, those with thick skin and firm flesh will suffer if they are heavily affected by cold; this is true both internally and externally, and they will then be ill. The Yellow Emperor said: Good! </p>
<p>[Note: Between skin and muscle lies the connection to the five organs&#39; true energy. Thus, thin skin and weak flesh signify that the organ&#39;s true energy is vacuous. If the energy of the five organs is vacuous, it cannot withstand the vacuous winds of the four seasons. The vacuous wind refers to the harmful wind of imbalance. Black is the color of water, signifying the thickness of kidney energy. Those who are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons indicate that the earth is strong throughout the seasons, while those who do not fall ill during the long summer imply that the earth governs the long summer. If there are those with thick skin and firm flesh who are harmed by the winds of the four seasons, they must be heavily affected by cold. In the ground, it is water; in the heavens, it is cold. The kidneys are the water organs, resonating with the cold energy from the heavens, thus appearing black. When those with thick skin and firm flesh fall ill, it must be due to significant exposure to cold, affecting both internally and externally—external exposure to the cold from the heavens harms the internal kidney&#39;s water energy.]<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on the Disturbance of Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one discern ailments of the skin, flesh, blood, and bones? Bo Gao replied: When the color arises between the two eyebrows, appearing moist, the ailment is in the skin. If the color of the lips is blue, yellow, red, white, or black, the ailment is in the flesh. If the complexion is moist, the ailment is in the blood and qi. If the eye color shows blue, yellow, red, white, or black, the ailment is in the tendons. If the ears are scorched and dry, covered in dust and filth, the ailment is in the bones. </p>
<p>[Note: The color reflects the condition of qi. The space between the eyebrows signifies the lung area. Since the lungs are linked to the skin, the moist color between the eyebrows indicates that the disturbance of defensive qi is in the skin. The flesh corresponds to the spleen; thus, observing the lip colors helps identify issues in the flesh. &#39;Rong&#39; refers to the essence of blood; sweat being a manifestation of blood moisture indicates issues in blood and qi. The liver governs the tendons, with the eyes being its orifice, and observing the eye colors helps identify issues in the tendons. Tendons connect to the twelve meridians of yin and yang, explaining the presence of multiple colors. The ears signify the kidney&#39;s orifice; when they are dry and soiled, it indicates that the disturbance of defensive qi is in the bones. The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones are the external manifestations of qi, with defensive qi emanating from the body and residing in their respective places.]<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who endure spring and summer are like trees that thrive in spring and grow in summer; those who do not endure autumn and winter suffer as trees wither and shed leaves in those seasons, thus leading to illness arising from these changes. This speaks to one’s nature alone. The foot’s Jueyin channel is governed by the Wood element, which symbolizes beauty, much like beautiful timber. The five musical notes correspond to the transformations of the five movements; the three Yang energies manage the six seasonal influences under heaven. The harmony of the five notes with the three Yang energies relates to the conjunction of the heavenly stems and earthly branches in accordance with the years’ movements.</p>
<p>The foot’s Jueyin and the foot&#39;s Shaoyang join together, aligning one Yin with the four Yangs flanking the Tai and Shao, responding to the earth positioned centrally, with heavenly energies operating above, below, and around.

A person characterized by the Tai Jiao is compared to the left foot&#39;s Shaoyang, while those characterized by the Jiao are likened to the right foot&#39;s Shaoyang. When the Shaoyang is robust, as described below, the chi and blood are abundant, resulting in a long and beautiful beard. The expression of being &quot;Yiyi&quot; suggests a humble demeanor, like branches and leaves that extend downward. &quot;Tu tui&quot; implies a proactive stance, akin to branches and leaves that reach upward.</p>
<p>&quot;Ban&quot; signifies discernment, or the lesser horn. Those characterized by the left horn are compared to the right foot&#39;s Shaoyang, while those associated with the &quot;pan jiao&quot; are likened to the left foot&#39;s Shaoyang. When the lower Shaoyang is vigorous, as noted below, the chi and blood flourish, leading to long leg hair and well-developed outer ankles. &quot;Zui zui&quot; denotes a harmonious demeanor, as with the bending form of wood, while &quot;Guo guo&quot; refers to an upright stance, much like the straightness of a tree trunk.</p>

When the water is weak, the people indulge in it and toy with it, resulting in many deaths. Therefore, people do not show reverence and often deceive others. Many who die meet their end due to excessive labor and exhaustion, as the quality of water is soft and weak, making it unsuitable for overexertion. In autumn and winter, it is the time when metal and water generate one another; in spring, wood releases the water&#39;s essence, and in summer, fire dries up the water. Hence, sickness arises in spring and summer. The foot&#39;s Shaoyin cold water governs qi; when it is muddy, it reflects a lowly state, like marshes and rivers that absorb filth. The foot&#39;s Shaoyin connects with the foot&#39;s Taiyang. The Taiyi person corresponds to the right foot of Taiyang, while the Shizhi person corresponds to the left foot of Taiyang. Those with a serene appearance under Taiyang suggest a robust blood and vitality, characterized by beautiful eyebrows which contain fine hairs. The cheek represents the supportive aspect. When one appears amiable and graceful, it indicates the Taiyang&#39;s elevated status, like having noble support. Serene means calm and unmoving. The Shaoyu person corresponds to the left foot of Taiyang, while the multitude corresponds to the right foot of Taiyang.

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: If one obtains the form but not the color, what then? Qi Bo replied: The form surpasses the color, and the color surpasses the form; when it is the time of dominance, years will add on, leading to ailments or distress if lost. When form and color are harmonious, there will be wealth, nobility, and great joy. The Yellow Emperor further inquired: Is it known when form and color dominate? Qi Bo responded: Those who are born in years marked by misfortune, particularly those commonly associated with increase, including the ages of seven, sixteen, twenty-five, thirty-four, forty-three, fifty-two, and sixty-one, all represent significant misfortunes; one must ensure personal peace during these times. When affected, there is illness; when lost, there is worry. During these times, one should avoid deceitful acts; this is called the year of taboo.</p>
<p>In explanation, when form surpasses color, it is like a person of great horns, whose color is yellow; when color surpasses form, it resembles a person of great womb, whose color is blue. Form signifies the substance of the five elements; color signifies the essence of the five elements. When form and essence are in harmony, they resonate with the creation of heaven and earth, thus leading to wealth, nobility, and great joy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As one ages, it begins at seven years, and every nine years thereafter, there are significant taboos concerning the harmony of color and form. Seven years represent the lesser yang; adding nine years makes it sixteen, and adding another nine makes it twenty-five. The reasoning is that for those with three yang in their hands and feet, starting from the lesser yang at seven, and adding the extreme yang at the end of nine brings regret. The cumulative years of these additions are the strongest taboos for the individual; one must not neglect their place. If they are affected, illness may ensue, leading to neglect and thus worry.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Your explanation of the pulse&#39;s fluctuations and the conditions of blood and qi—how does it reflect on physical form and energy?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Above the foot yangming, when blood and qi are abundant, the beard is handsome and long; when blood is insufficient but qi is abundant, the beard is short. If qi is scarce and blood is ample, there will be less beard; if both are lacking, there will be no beard, and the lips might be overdrawn.</p>
<p>Below the foot yangming, when blood and qi are full, body hair grows beautifully long to the chest; when blood is rich but qi is poor, body hair is short to the navel. When moving, they can lift their feet well, but the toes are lean and the feet are cold. If blood is inadequate and qi is in excess, the flesh may appear but be weak; if both are scarce, there will be no hair, and if present, it will be sparse and emaciated, leading to weakness and numbness in the feet.</p>
<p>Note: The growth of hair signifies the vitality of skin and flesh, reflecting the warm and penetrative qualities of the blood and qi. The three yang of the hands and feet each follow their respective meridians and divide where the skin is concerned, which is why the Emperor inquired about the state of the pulse to understand physical condition and energy.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The flow of the meridians depends on the circulation of qi and blood, allowing us to understand the vitality within the body. The form refers to the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. For the Yangming meridian in the legs, its upward path moves past the corners of the mouth, encircling the lips and connecting to the承浆 (Chengjiang). Therefore, when the blood and qi within the skin are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long; when blood is scarce and qi is plentiful, the beard is short; when qi is scarce and blood is plentiful, the beard is sparse; and when both qi and blood are deficient, there is no beard at all. Abundant blood seeps through the skin, producing fine hair, while qi is what nourishes the skin, filling the body and enriching the hair. </p>
<p>Thus, the beard and hair on the face and body all rely on the qi and blood in the skin for growth. Therefore, when qi is deficient, the beard is sparse; when blood is deficient, the beard is short; and when both are deficient, there is no beard. When blood and qi are insufficient to nourish the skin, leading to a lack of fullness in the flesh, there are many lines and wrinkles. </p>
<p>For the downward path of the Yangming meridian, it travels through the chest, descends to the navel, traverses from the knee to the ankle, so when the blood and qi in the lower skin are abundant, the body hair is attractive and lengthy down to the chest; when blood is abundant and qi is scarce, the body hair is beautiful but short down to the navel; when both blood and qi are lacking, there is no hair, or if present, it is thin and withered. The toes have little flesh; if the feet are prone to cold, it signifies the qi that nourishes the skin, enriching the body and hair. Coldness in the hands and feet results in frostbite. The blood warms the skin and nourishes the flesh; if blood is deficient, the flesh becomes cold. Weakness and numbness in the feet arise from insufficient blood and qi, which fail to nourish the tendons and bones.</p>
<p>At the upper part of the lesser yang, when the blood and qi are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long; when blood is abundant and qi is scarce, the beard is beautiful but short; when blood is scarce and qi is abundant, there is less beard; and when both blood and qi are deficient, there is no beard.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When affected by cold and dampness, one suffers from rheumatism, leading to bone pain and shriveled nails. In the lower part of the foot&#39;s lesser yang, if blood and qi are abundant, then the hair on the shank is long and beautiful, and the outer ankle is swollen; if there is more blood and less qi, the hair on the shank is short but still beautiful, and the outer ankle&#39;s skin is thick and firm; if there is less blood and more qi, there is sparse hair on the shank, and the outer ankle&#39;s skin is thin and soft; if both blood and qi are deficient, there is no hair, and the outer ankle is thin with no flesh.</p>
<p>(Note: The foot&#39;s lesser yang meridian ascends in front of and behind the ear, passes the cheekbone, and moves down to the neck and nape. Therefore, when the blood and qi in the skin are plentiful, the beard grows long; if blood is abundant and qi is deficient, the beard will be short but still beautiful. Hair is the surplus of blood, hence when there is more blood and less qi, it can be short and still attractive. The skin, being yang, contrasts with the muscles and bones, which are yin. Illness in the yang is referred to as wind, while illness in the yin is called rheumatism. Nails are the surplus of the muscles, and when both blood and qi are low, they cannot nourish the muscles and bones. This allows the cold and dampness to linger, causing bone pain and shriveled nails. The meridian that descends follows the outer edge of the knee, moves down in front of the fibula, reaches the tip of the fibula, exits in front of the outer ankle, and follows the foot&#39;s tarsus. Therefore, when the blood and qi in the lower skin and flesh are abundant, the hair on the shank is long and beautiful, and the outer ankle is plump; if blood is abundant, the skin is thick and firm; if blood is scant, the skin is thin and soft. This is the reason why blood seeps into the skin lightly.)<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The eyebrow is generated from pre-natal essence; thus, beautiful eyebrows are those that have been nourished by rich blood and energy. The fine hairs are the long hairs within the eyebrows, which grow due to abundant blood and energy, and are a product of post-natal development. Poor eyebrows lack luster and appear withered. A face with many fine lines has numerous small textures, indicating a lack of energy, which cannot properly nourish the skin. When there is little blood and much energy, the face becomes plump; this is how energy fills the pores. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The heart connects to the pulse; its vitality shows in the color.&quot; The &quot;Smooth Pulse&quot; chapter says: &quot;When the pulse is slow, yang energy flourishes, its color is bright, and the face is radiant.&quot; When blood and energy are harmonious, it means that the blood and energy in the meridians and skin are well-regulated, leading to a fresh and beautiful complexion. The essence from the organs and viscera all derives from the meridian of the Greater Yang, which governs all the yang channels.

<p>The sage observes the colors. Yellow and red indicate an abundance of heat, while blue and white suggest less heat. Black indicates a surplus of blood and a deficiency of qi. Those with beautiful eyebrows have a lot of blood from the sun, while those with full beards and long mustaches have less yang and more blood. Those with fine beards have an abundance of blood from the yangming. This is just how it is in due course.</p>
<p>(Note: Red represents summer, and yellow signifies late summer, thus yellow and red indicate more heat, which is the yang energy. Blue represents spring and white represents autumn, leading to blue and white indicating less heat. Black corresponds to the winter watery phase, in which yang energy is deeply concealed, resulting in more blood and less qi. The three yin and three yang represent the six energies of heaven, also aligning with the four seasons: the first energy is the spring wind wood, the second is the lesser yang fire, the third is the lesser yin fire, the fourth is the greater yin damp earth, the fifth is the yangming dry metal, and the final energy is the greater sun cold water. There are these six energies in heaven, and humans also possess these six energies. Correspondingly, this aligns with the organs and meridians, divided into twelve categories of hands and feet. In the yin and yang of heaven, there are merely the six energies of great and small. Hence, beautiful eyebrows indicate an abundance of blood from the sun, full beards and long mustaches indicate lesser yang and more blood, while fine beards indicate an abundance of blood from the yangming.)<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

<p>The small stomach and large intestine indicate that the upper part is yang and the lower part is yin. With an excess of yin and less yang, the imbalance of the six bowels follows. Yang energy originates in the middle jiao; the small yangming pulse suggests a deficiency in the source of yang.

<p>When observing a person&#39;s eyes, if there is slight swelling in the eye socket resembling someone just waking up, and if the neck pulse is active with coughing, pressing on the hands and feet shows no response, this indicates edema due to wind and water. </p>
<p>[Note: The pulse of the foot&#39;s solar meridian begins at the eyes and exits at the neck. The upper part of the solar meridian is governed by cold water. The energy of the solar meridian circulates on the skin&#39;s surface, so this water overflows between the skin layers, causing slight swelling in the eye socket. If the neck pulse is active and the skin is swollen with coughing, it indicates that water is retained in the skin and affects the lung energy. Wind and water, in this context, are caused by external exposure to wind, which causes the water to disperse.]</p>
<p>A slippery texture on the skin of the pulse indicates wind. If the flesh at the pulse is weak, this suggests a need for rest. If the flesh is detached, it indicates an imbalance of cold and heat that has not been treated. If the skin is slippery and moist, this also indicates wind. If the skin is coarse like dried fish scales, this suggests water retention from fluid intake. A pulse that is hot and vigorous indicates a warm disease; if the pulse is strong and slippery, it suggests a condition that is emerging.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the skin at the wrist is cold and the pulse is weak, it indicates a deficiency of qi. When the skin at the wrist is first hot and then cold, it signifies an alternation of cold and heat. When the skin at the wrist is initially cold, then becomes hot after a prolonged duration, it also indicates an alternation of cold and heat.</p>
<p>(Note: The moisture that accumulates on the skin is due to the presence of wind, which stirs up the bodily fluids. The fat mentioned here refers to the fatty membrane between the muscle fibers. When the skin is smooth and moist with fat, it indicates the presence of wind in the muscles. In this context, the skin represents the yang, while the muscles and bones represent the yin. Conditions affecting the yang are referred to as wind, and those affecting the yin are termed as bi syndromes. If the skin is rough, it suggests that wind is causing blockage between the muscles and bones. This allows us to ascertain the severity of the wind-afflicting condition based on the texture of the skin.</p>
<p>The muscles are connected to the essence of the five organs and are governed by the spleen. Thus, when the flesh at the wrist is weak, it indicates a deficiency in the spleen, which leads to difficulty in resting properly. &quot;Difficulty&quot; here refers to sluggishness. If the flesh deteriorates, it suggests a loss of form.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When Yang is deficient, there is susceptibility to cold; when Yin is deficient, there is fever. Both Yin and Yang, as well as form and qi, have been depleted, leading to ineffective treatment. Like the scales of a withered fish, the skin develops cold grains. Cold is the essence of water. This water pathogen seeps inward, hence the cold appearance on the outside. In cases of warm illness, cold toxins are hidden in the skin and manifest as warm disease in spring. Therefore, when the skin is hot and the pulse is strong and agitated, it indicates warm illness; if the pulse is strong and slippery, it suggests the disease is emerging from the outside. When the skin is cold and the pulse is weak, it indicates insufficient qi. Qi warms the skin and meat, originating from Yin and emerging from within to the outside, hence it is known that the internal is leaking and the external is deficient. This is how one diagnoses internal causes through the pulse at the wrist. The skin&#39;s response—first hot then cold, or first cold then hot—reflects the interplay of cold and heat, as the wrist governs the energies of three Yin and three Yang. The warm sensation isolated in the elbow relates to the heat above the waist, while the isolated warmth in the hand pertains to the heat below the waist.

<p>Bian Que’s Difficulties </p>
<p>Observing the Color </p>
<p>The Thirteenth Difficulty states: The classic mentions that if one sees a color but cannot discern the pulse, and instead finds a pulse that counters (the expected), death ensues; if one finds a pulse that nourishes (the expected), the illness will cease. How should color and pulse correspond? [Note: The &quot;Lingshu&quot; in Chapter Four states: To see the color and know the disease is termed &#39;bright&#39;; to examine the pulse and know the disease is termed &#39;spirit&#39;. Inquiring about the disease and knowing its location is termed &#39;skillful&#39;. Color, pulse, form, and flesh must not be lost to each other. If the color is green, the pulse should be wiry; if red, the pulse should be surging and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be middle-sized and slow; if white, the pulse should be floating and thin; if black, the pulse should be deep and slippery. The notion of not being able to match color with pulse refers to their disconnection. If color and pulse do not correspond, whatever pulse is perceivable, if it counters, indicates death; if it nourishes, the illness will cease.] Thus, the five organs correspond to five colors, all visible on the face, should also correlate within the radial pulse. For instance, if the color is green, the pulse should be wiry and rapid; if red, the pulse should be superficial, large, and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large; if white, the pulse should be superficial, thin, and short; if black, the pulse should be deep and slippery. This is what is meant by the correspondence between the five colors and the pulses. [Note: The correspondence between color and pulse is represented this way, hence the concept of seeing the color and discerning the pulse.]<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five organs each have their own sounds, colors, smells, and tastes, which correspond to the pulse at the inch and the chi (cubit). Those that do not correspond indicate illness. For example, if the color is green, the pulse is floating, thready, and short; if it is strong and slow, it represents overcoming; if it is floating, large, and diffuse, it is small and slippery, representing generation. </p>
<p>(Note: The reference to green illustrates how overcoming and generating work. Green is the color of the liver; a floating, thready, and short pulse indicates the lung pulse, which signifies metal overcoming wood. A strong and slow pulse indicates the spleen pulse, representing wood overcoming earth, thus illustrating overcoming. A floating, large, and diffuse pulse indicates the heart pulse, signifying wood generating fire; a small and slippery pulse indicates the kidney pulse, representing water generating wood. This is known as the pulse of overcoming indicates death, while the pulse of generation indicates that the illness resolves itself.)</p>

If the liver pulse is detected, the external signs are clean, with a bluish complexion and good anger; the internal signs show movement on the left side of the navel, pressing it firmly feels painful; the illness includes fullness and stagnation in the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, and muscle cramps. If these symptoms exist, it is the liver; if they do not, it is not.</p>
<p>(Note: The detection of the liver pulse means diagnosing the string-like pulse. The liver and gallbladder are linked, thus being an organ of clarity; hence the cleanliness. The liver is known as the general&#39;s organ, which allows for good anger. The bluish hue reflects the color of the liver. The other signs indicate favorable pulse conditions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Feng says that when liver qi (Yue Zhen) is stagnant, the limbs become full and closed. The commentary states: this is due to wind and indulgent diseases. The jueyin pulse travels through the yin organs; thus, liver illness makes urination and defecation difficult. Cramps occur because the liver governs the tendons. This pertains to the categories of internal conditions and the diseases it governs. </p>
<p>If one is able to discern the heart pulse, the external symptoms are a red face, dry mouth, and a tendency to laugh; the internal manifestation is movement in the area above the navel, which feels firm and painful to touch; the illnesses include anxiety, heart pain, heat in the palms, and dry heaving. If these are present, it indicates heart illness; if not, it does not. </p>
<p>Note that the heart pulse runs through the palm. The true heart is not affected by evil; only the hand’s palm is influenced by it. &quot;Dry heaving&quot; refers to retching. When there is heart illness, fire is abundant, hence the retching. The classics say: all rebellious qi that rises is related to fire; vomiting and sourness pertain to heat.</p>
<p>If one is able to discern the spleen pulse, the external symptoms include a yellow face, good belching, good thinking, and good taste; the internal manifestation occurs at the navel with movement that is firm and painful to touch; the illnesses include abdominal distension, poor digestion, a heavy body with joint pain, laziness, and a desire to lie down and not use the limbs. If these are present, it indicates spleen illness; if not, it does not. </p>
<p>Note that the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that belching is due to cold qi residing in the stomach, which then reverses and disperses upward from below, ultimately leading to belching. The classics say that the spleen governs the limbs.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a></p></div>

The illness presents as wheezing and coughing, with chills and fever. If these signs are present, it indicates a lung condition; if not, it does not.</p>
<p>(Note: Yang qi harmonizes and is abundant in the heart, which manifests through the nose, hence the sneezing. Chills and fever relate to the lung, which governs the skin and hair.)</p>
<p>If one finds the kidney pulse, the external symptoms are a dark face, frequent fear, and yawning; the internal symptoms show movement below the navel that feels firm and painful upon pressing. The illness presents as rebellious qi, urgent pain in the lower abdomen, and diarrhea that is heavy and watery, with coldness in the legs and reverse flow.

<p>(Note: Insufficient kidney qi leads to fear, the interaction of yin and yang causes yawning, and heavy diarrhea refers to Shaoyin diarrhea.)</p>

<p>If a patient opens their eyes and is thirsty, with firmness below the heart, the pulse should feel tight and strong and rapid, but if instead, it is found to be deep, weak, and faint, it indicates death.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; it is stated that blue-black indicates pain, yellow-red indicates heat, and white indicates cold. It is further mentioned that if red appears on both cheeks and is thumb-sized, even if the illness seems minor, it will certainly end in death. If black appears in the courtyard and is thumb-sized, it will surely result in sudden death without prior illness. Additionally, it states that in diagnosing blood vessels, if there is much red and heat, much blue and pain, and much black, it indicates a prolonged ailment. If all three colors—black, red, and blue—are present, it signifies cold-heat accompanied by body pain, a slightly yellow complexion, yellowish dental deposits, and yellow on the nails, indicating jaundice. Furthermore, when examining a parturient with a red face and a blue tongue, the mother may survive while the child dies; if both face and tongue are blue with foam, the mother dies while the child lives; if both lips and mouth are blue, both the mother and child die, and so forth. Yuan states that the colors of the five internal organs as seen on the face correspond to specific areas and reflect mutual generation and overcoming; thus, observing them can reveal the illness. The text suggests that knowledge from external sources is called &#39;sage,&#39; while knowledge from internal understanding is called &#39;divine,&#39; referring to this distinction. </p>
<p>(Note: The annotations clarify that external knowledge comes from observation and listening, while internal knowledge comes from inquiry and palpation. &#39;Divine&#39; refers to something subtle, while &#39;sage&#39; implies clarity.)<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Observation and Hearing</strong></p>
<p>A question was asked: When the patient&#39;s energy is reflected in the face, I would like to know its implications! The master said: If the tip of the nose is blue, and there is abdominal pain with suffering from cold, the patient will die; if the tip of the nose is slightly black, there is water vapor; if it is yellow, there is cold in the chest; if it is white, there is loss of blood. If there is a slight red not in the right time, the patient will die. If the eyes are perfectly round, the disease cannot be treated. Blue indicates pain, black indicates exhaustion, red indicates wind, yellow suggests difficulty in bowel movements, and bright colors indicate fluid retention. The master said: If breath causes the shoulders to shake, the heart is firm. If breath pulls air from the chest, it indicates cough. If breath comes with a short gasp from an open mouth, it indicates lung atrophy with salivation. The master said: A slight rapid inhalation indicates a disease in the middle jiao; if it is real, treating it will bring recovery, but if it is false, it cannot be treated. In the upper jiao, breathing is rapid; in the lower jiao, breathing is distant; all these are difficult to treat. If breathing moves and shakes vigorously, it cannot be treated. The master said: If the pulse at the wrist moves, it reflects its proper time. For example, if the liver&#39;s color is blue, it follows the colors of each season. If the liver is blue but reflects white, it is not in its proper color, and the pulse will indicate a disease.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Observation and Listening</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is floating and surging, the body sweats profusely, there’s persistent wheezing, the patient cannot take in water, the body feels numb, and there are alternating states of calm and agitation, this indicates a critical condition. Furthermore, it is unclear which organ has first suffered. If there is sweating and persistent wheezing, this indicates the lung has been primarily affected. If the yang remains alone, the body appears smoke-damaged, and the patient stares with a swaying head, this indicates the heart has failed. If the lips and mouth turn bluish, and the limbs become cold, this indicates the liver has failed. If the mouth is dark and the sweat is soft and yellow, this indicates the spleen has failed. If there is loss of urination and defecation, with wild talk and a fixed gaze, this indicates the kidney has failed. </p>
<p>A question is posed: The skilled doctor knows by observation, the moderately skilled by inquiry, and the unskilled by pulse diagnosis. I wish to hear more! The teacher replied: When a patient’s family requests help, saying the patient suffers from fever and body pain, and the patient rests, when the teacher examines the pulse and finds it sinking and slow, he knows the condition is critical. How does he know this? The pulse of a person with an external illness should be floating and large; however, if the pulse is sinking and slow, it indicates improvement. For example, if the patient says their abdomen suddenly hurts while sitting, and the teacher examines the pulse to find it floating and large, he knows the condition is critical. How does he know this? The pulse of someone with an internal illness should be sinking and thin; if the pulse is floating and large, it indicates improvement. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Tomorrow, when the teacher arrives, the patient lies against the wall; the heat has already subsided. If the pulse is not harmonious, it is said that the patient has already recovered. If the patient lies against the wall, hears the teacher&#39;s arrival, and does not start up in surprise or look around, as if speaking in threes and pausing in threes, and if the pulse has trouble swallowing saliva, this is a feigned illness. If it is said that the pulse is naturally harmonious, it is described that your illness is too severe, and you must take expelling and purging medicines, along with acupuncture at several dozen or even a hundred points.</p>
<p>When the teacher takes the pulse, if the patient has a weak pulse, there is no illness; if the pulse is groaning, there is illness. A slow speech indicates wind; shaking the head while speaking indicates internal pain; if walking slowly, it indicates an exterior strength; if sitting and reclining, it indicates shortness of breath; if sitting and lowering one foot, it indicates waist pain; if the abdomen feels firm, as if protecting an egg, it indicates heart pain.</p>
<p>When asked: What is the state of the pulse for someone fearful due to illness? The teacher said: The pulse moves as if entwined in threads, and the complexion is pale and loses color. </p>
<p>For someone who does not drink, what is the state of their pulse? The teacher said: The pulse is naturally thin, and the lips and mouth are dry.</p>
<p>For someone who feels shame, what type of pulse do they have? The teacher said: The pulse is floating, and the complexion alternates between pale and red.</p>
<p>The pulse at the inch (cun) is weak and thin. The weak indication suggests the defensive qi is weak, and the thin indication suggests the nutritive qi is insufficient. If the defensive qi is weak, the complexion is yellow; if the nutritive qi is insufficient, the complexion is blue. The nutritive qi is the root, while the defensive qi is the leaf. If both the nutritive and defensive qi are weak, then the root and leaves wither, leading to chills and coughing, with the expectoration of foul-tasting phlegm and saliva. </p>

<p>Regarding the five colors and pulse diagnosis:</p>
<p>A pale face with no right Guan pulse indicates a deficiency in the spleen, as wood overcomes earth. A red face with no right Cun pulse indicates a deficiency in the lungs, as fire overcomes metal. A white face with no left Guan pulse indicates a deficiency in the liver, as metal overcomes wood. A yellow face with no left Chi pulse indicates a deficiency in the kidneys, as earth overcomes water. A black face with no left Cun pulse indicates a deficiency in the heart, as water overcomes fire.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis: [Jin Dynasty - Wang Shuhe]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colors of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heart Verse:</strong> The color of the heart is red, seen as the color of a rooster&#39;s comb, auspicious if seen; ominous if the blood is stagnant and dark. (Note: The rooster&#39;s comb is red. Stagnant blood is red and black. Red is the primary color indicating harmony, while black signifies water overcoming fire, hence ominous.) (Tong Jinzi says: The heart&#39;s color is red, but the heart inside cannot be seen; thus, the saying, auspicious if the rooster&#39;s comb is seen, ominous if stagnant blood is seen. Shuhe states in the classics that each of the five organs is associated with five colors observable on the face, which should also correspond to the pulse at the radial artery. If the color is red, the pulse should be floating, large, and dispersed. Red is the color of the heart. Floating, large, and dispersed corresponds to the heart pulse. Thus, the colors of the five organs can all be observed on the face.)</p>
<p><strong>Liver Verse:</strong> The color of the liver is green; a bright green feather portends auspiciousness, while a face the color of withered grass indicates calamity. (Note: The liver is associated with the color green. Bright green feathers are blue mixed with red; withered grass is blue mixed with white. Red belongs to the heart&#39;s fire, while white belongs to the lung&#39;s metal. Wood generates fire, thus it is auspicious; metal overcomes wood, thus it indicates calamity.)</p>
<p><strong>Kidney Verse:</strong> The color of the kidneys is black; resembling soot is ominous.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: The color of the kidney is fundamentally black, resembling dark feathers, black with a hint of blue. Blue belongs to the liver and is associated with water nourishing wood, hence it is said to be auspicious. The color that resembles coal is black with a yellow tint. Yellow belongs to the earth, which overcomes water, hence it is said to be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Lung Praise</strong>: When pig lard congeals, it is auspicious, but a withered bone means life is difficult. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The lung is golden in color, white and shiny. White represents metal, and luster represents water; metal can generate water, thus it is said to be auspicious. The color of a withered bone is white but lacks luster. White is metal, and lack of luster indicates loss of internal moisture due to fire drying it out. Fire diminishes metal, thus it is said that life is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Praise</strong>: When there is phlegm it accumulates in winter, the skin turns yellow and the body feels dim.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The classics state that the accumulation in the spleen is termed phlegm, located in the stomach, covering a large area like a plate. If it does not heal for a long time, it causes the limbs to weaken, leads to jaundice, and affects digestion, resulting in a yellow and emaciated complexion. This is caused by the winter days of Ren and Gui. Why? Liver illness can affect the spleen, which should then convey to the kidneys. The kidneys are strong in the winter, and when strong, they do not accept evil. But the spleen still wants to send things back to the liver. The liver refuses to accept, thus it remains trapped as accumulation. Hence, it is known that phlegm accumulates in winter during the days of Ren and Gui.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Observing Colors to Diagnose Illness and Life and Death Song</strong></p>
<p>To heal a sickness, if the eye corners are yellow and the eyelids suddenly sink, one can certainly know death is nearing. </p>
<p>[Note: The eye corresponds to the five organs and the five elements: the pupil is associated with the kidneys and the water element, the black part of the eye is related to the liver and the wind element, the upper and lower eyelids correspond to the spleen and the meat element, the white of the eye is linked to the lungs and the air element, and the corners of the eyes correspond to the heart and blood. Yellow corners indicate a fire element nourishing earth; when stomach qi begins to act, it suggests impending recovery. Sunken eyelids mean the vital qi of the five organs has ceased, indicating imminent death. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that sunken eyes indicate death. The solar pulse emerges from the eyes; if sunken, the solar energy has been exhausted, hence death. The solar energy governs all yang energies, thus it is specifically mentioned.]</p>
<p>If black appears in the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, entering indicates that ten die and seven cannot endure it.</p>
<p>[Note: Black is the color of the kidneys. Kidney illness saturates the organs, leading to blackness in the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. The tongue resides within the mouth and belongs to the heart&#39;s fire; if black from outside enters the mouth, water overwhelms fire, hence knowing that the probability is ten die without one surviving. The number of fire is seven, thus the seventh day is hard to endure.]</p>
<p>With a yellow face and blue eyes, drinking excessively often leads to chaos; malignant wind resides in the stomach, affecting the body.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Alcohol is a damp and hot substance; excessive drinking harms the spleen and stomach, resulting in a yellow complexion. When the spleen and stomach accumulate heat, it generates wind, hence the appearance of blue in the eyes. The whole body depends on the qi of the stomach for nourishment; if the wind pathogen remains in the stomach, it spreads throughout the body. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when there is illness with body heat and fatigue, sweating like a bath, and aversion to wind, what disease is this? Qi Bo says: &quot;It is wind caused by alcohol.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Black face and white eyes signify the failure of the life gate, extreme fatigue leads to death on the eighth day.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong> Black represents water. Eyes represent wood. White represents metal. The life gate signifies fire. Water&#39;s excessive infiltration harms the fire qi, and metal restrains wood, thus depleting the source of fire. Therefore, the fire of the life gate is diminished. The maximum amount of fire is seven; thus, it reaches its peak in seven days, leading to death on the eighth day.  </p>
<p><strong>A sudden change in complexion to green, appearing black, difficult to withstand in sudden death.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong> The blue-black color pertains to the liver and kidneys. The transition from green to black means failure in recovery; when the spirit departs, there is death.  </p>
<p><strong>Red face and white eyes indicate distressed breathing, and after ten days, life or death is determined.</strong><br><strong>Note:</strong> Distressed breathing refers to panting or breathlessness.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

The number of metal is nine, while ten is the number of earth. Earth can give birth to metal; if it cannot, it will die, hence it is said to wait for ten days.</p>
<p>A red face and blue eyes are signs of widespread injury; when the channels of vitality and defense are obstructed, death will swiftly follow.</p>

<p>If the spine aches and the waist feels heavy repeatedly, this indicates that the bones have deteriorated, and one should observe for five days.

The classics state: when the foot&#39;s Jueyin energy is depleted, the muscles constrict, drawing the ovaries and rolling the tongue. Jueyin refers to the liver channel. The liver connects with the muscles. Muscles gather at the reproductive organs and are linked to the base of the tongue; therefore, if the pulse is not nourished, the muscles tighten. Tightened muscles draw on the ovaries and tongue. The rolled tongue and constricted ovaries signal that the muscles are failing first.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>On a bing day, there is severity; on a ding day, there is death. The song of the kidneys states: &quot;If the face is dark and the teeth hurt, and the eyes are like those of the blind, with spontaneous sweating like water and frequent back pain; if the skin and flesh are moist and the hair lacks luster, then within four days, one’s life will surely not endure.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: A dark face resembles dirt; eyes like those of the blind imply dilated pupils. Spontaneous sweating like water indicates excessive heat. The waist is associated with the kidneys; if the kidneys fail, the waist feels as though it is broken. Without nourishment from the bone marrow, the bones and flesh cannot connect; when the flesh is moist but retreats, it cannot be the master of the five bodily fluids, which results in hair not being nourished. From jia to wu spans four days. Wu belongs to the earth, and earth overcomes water, hence life does not endure. The text states: If the foot&#39;s shaoyin energy is exhausted, then the bones wither. Shaoyin represents the winter pulse, operating silently while warming the bone marrow. Therefore, if the bone marrow is not warmed, the flesh will not adhere to the bones; if the bones and flesh do not unite, the flesh becomes moist but retreats; when the flesh is moist and retreats, the teeth elongate and become brittle. Lack of luster in the hair signifies that the bones have perished first.

This is called the flourishing of the five organs, in accordance with the succession of the five elements. Observing the liver pulse presents colors of blue and white, the heart pulse shows red and black, the spleen pulse displays yellow and blue, the lung pulse reveals white and red, and the kidney pulse indicates black and yellow.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is wind in the lungs, the eyebrows are white; if there is wind in the heart, the mouth is red; if there is wind in the liver, the eyes are blue; if there is wind in the spleen, the nose is yellow; if there is wind in the kidneys, the skin is black; this is due to the wind traveling with various changes. If there is heat in the liver, the left cheek is red; if there is heat in the lungs, the right cheek is red; if there is heat in the heart, the face is red; if there is heat in the spleen, the nose is red; if there is heat in the kidneys, the jaw is red; this happens because all forms of heat belong to fire. Therefore, the blue-black signifies pain, yellow-red signifies heat, and blue-white signifies cold, as these are the results of the nine types of qi. A blue nose indicates abdominal water, black indicates water qi, white indicates lack of blood, yellow indicates chest cold, red indicates presence of wind, vivid reflections indicate retained fluids; thus, the five colors are determined by this. However, in examining patients, one must take the true spleen as the foundation. The true yellow of the spleen represents the heavenly qi. The five colors show clarity, and even if the illness is long-standing, a yellow face must develop, as it shows the manifestation of true qi. Although these points represent established methods, one cannot reach this understanding without a clear heart perceiving the obscurities. Hence, discerning the five colors with minute examinations and through the eyes is particularly difficult. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: to observe and know is called spirit. By seeing the five colors externally, one determines life and death.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Observation and Diagnosis</strong>  </p>
<p>When the disease manifests suddenly, if the disease&#39;s energy and spirit increase, it indicates an excess of pathogenic energy, meaning evil energy prevails. One should immediately purge it using cold, cool, sour, and bitter medicines. Conversely, if the disease manifests and the spirit becomes weak and exhausted, it indicates a deficiency of pathogenic energy, meaning true energy is lacking. In this case, one should urgently replenish it using warm, sweet, and spicy medicines. Regardless of whether the body&#39;s energy is in excess or deficient, one should only consider the excess or deficiency of pathogenic energy. For those with deficiency, replenish it; for those with excess, purge it. If pathogenic energy is in excess, one should urgently purge it with cooling medicines, as evil energy prevails. If pathogenic energy is insufficient, one should urgently replenish it with warm, sweet, and spicy medicines, indicating a lack of true energy. The body&#39;s energy refers to the breath that enters through the mouth and nose, while &quot;form&quot; refers to the skin, sinews, bones, and blood vessels. A robust body indicates excess, while a thinner body indicates deficiency. The energy refers specifically to the breath in the mouth and nose; if it is laboring as usual, that indicates an excess of energy. If there is wheezing, shortness of breath, or an inability to breathe, that indicates a deficiency. Hence, it is said: the body&#39;s energy is the energy and blood within a person&#39;s form.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a need to reinforce or to drain, it is not solely dependent on the situation but rather on the timing of the disease&#39;s manifestation. When the pathogen increases, it indicates that the evil energy is dominant, and there is an urgent need to drain it. If, during the onset, the spirit is weakened and speech is feeble or lazily spoken, it indicates insufficient vital energy, and there is an urgent need to reinforce it. If the patient has an insufficient constitution, and during the onset of the disease, the pathogen is also weak, this signifies that both yin and yang are deficient. Needling should be avoided, and it is advisable to reinforce with sweet medicines but not to exceed the dosage. Cauterization should not be abandoned. The point located five cun below the umbilicus is the Qi Sea point. </p>
<p>For qi disorders, drinking water is appropriate, while for blood disorders, one should not drink water. In cases of qi illness, there is numbness; in cases of blood illness, there is pain. If there is no yang, there is coldness; if there is no yin, there is vomiting. A yin condition shows a still body, muted speech, difficulty in breathing, eyes unable to see clearly, inability to exhale or inhale through the nose, coldness in the air of both mouth and nose, inability to take in fluids, uncontrollable bowel movements, accompanied with severe coldness, as if being cut by a knife.

<p><strong>Observe Color and Pulse to Determine Fortune</strong></p>
<p>Pulse is associated with the earth. Color is associated with the heavens. When earth gives birth to heaven, it is harmonious; when heaven gives birth to earth, it is discordant. For example, if one has a string pulse and the face is red, then earth gives birth to heaven. This indicates harmony, suggesting a swift recovery in a child supported by the mother. Conversely, if one has a string pulse and the face is black, then heaven gives birth to earth. This indicates discord, suggesting a slow recovery when the mother suppresses the child. Color represents the yang energy within yin and originates from heaven. Pulse represents the yin energy within yang and originates from the earth.</p>

Determine the count based on the illness&#39;s location, then count backward to where the previous count ends.

<p>For example, if the patient perceives both pleasant and unpleasant scents, the heart governs the five aromas, entering the spleen with those scents. Count from the east to the main condition; the main condition concerning the five aromas is the heart. One from the east and two from the south gives a count of two. Then, in dealing with the area of the illness, count backward. The spleen is one and the heart is two; thus, the original count is two. This leads you to the heart, which is the fire of the channel.

<p>&quot;To harmonize color and pulse is to achieve complete health.</p>
<p>To understand the internal, one must observe the external; by diagnosing the external, one can know the internal. What exists internally must manifest externally. If one does not correlate the symptoms to determine the nature and sequence of the illness, it cannot be accomplished. A skilled practitioner thoroughly studies the principles, hence observes the five colors—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—corresponding to the pulses of the five organs, exploring their correlations and discrepancies. By feeling the five pulses—rapid, strong, slow, weak, or deep—one can align them with the colors of the five organs, and discern what is balanced and what is not. If one can truly perceive the subtle colors and diagnose the delicate pulses, treating based on the interplay of internal and external factors, then the greatest effectiveness can be achieved effortlessly. The <em>Suwen</em> states: &#39;By harmonizing color and pulse, one can achieve complete health.&#39; This is its meaning. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the principle of Dao manifests as the distinction between yin and yang, dispersing into the five elements, which all individuals possess. The five pulses are the truth of heaven, circulating blood and qi, connecting yin and yang to nourish the body. The five colors are the manifestations of qi, corresponding to the five elements, harmonizing with the four seasons, and displaying upon the face.&quot;<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

For instance, if the liver&#39;s color appears a vibrant green and the pulse is slightly tense and rapid, it signifies vitality; but if it is floating, weak, and the color is like withered grass, can it generate life? If the heart&#39;s color resembles a red cockscomb, the pulse should be floating, large, and dispersed, indicating harmony; yet if it is heavy and slippery, with a color resembling stagnant blood, can it be harmonious? The spleen&#39;s color is like the yellow of a crab&#39;s belly, the pulse should be moderate, relaxed, and large, indicating compliance; if it is slightly tense and rapid, with a color like bitter fruit, can it comply? The lung&#39;s color is similar to white pig fat, the pulse should be floating, weak, and short, indicating good fortune; however, if it is floating, large, and dispersed, and the color resembles dry bone, can it be fortunate? Finally, if the kidney&#39;s color appears black like crow feathers, the pulse should be heavy, slippery, and relaxed, indicating life; but if the pulse is slow and large, and the color resembles charred material, it signifies death.

The Thirteen Difficulties says: the relationship between colors and pulses must be considered together. However, the comprehensive ability to heal diseases cannot be achieved if one does not align with both colors and pulses. The chapter on the generation of the five organs says: the heart corresponds to the pulse, and its color is its radiance. The qualities of pulse—thick, thin, slippery, rough, floating, sinking—can indicate differences. The subtle diagnosis of the five colors can be observed with the eyes. Following this with the ability to combine colors and pulses can lead to full healing. It is stated that the red pulse is prominent and hard, the white pulse is floating and restless, the green pulse is long and shifts left and right, the yellow pulse is large and weak, and the black pulse is hard and large at the top. First, the five colors are mentioned, then the five pulses, with the intention that future scholars understand and identify their connections. Later, Bian Que understood this distinctly and expressed: Knowing by observation is called spirit; knowing by feeling the pulse is called skill. This deeply grasps the principles of the Inner Canon.

<p>In the treatment of illness, one must first observe the condition of the body and then examine the pulse and inquire about the symptoms. The classics say: The method of pulse diagnosis involves observing a person&#39;s courage and fears, their muscles and skin, to understand their condition for diagnosis. The shapes of people differ: long is not equal to short, large is not equal to small, and fat is not equal to thin. The coloring differs as well: white is not equal to black, tender is not equal to faded, thin is not equal to thick. Furthermore, the fat person tends to have excess moisture, and the thin person tends to have excess heat; the pale have weak lung qi, while the dark-skinned have sufficient kidney qi. Since shapes and colors are different, the organs are also distinct; even if the external symptoms are similar, the treatments must differ greatly. Thus, the pulse of a fat person is often floating, while that of a thin person is deep; an agitated individual may have a slow pulse, while a relaxed person may have a rapid pulse, indicating that one cannot adopt a uniform view. </p>
<p>For example, take Chen from Dongyang: he has prominent veins, his body is slightly elongated, and he suffers from exhaustion and labor, experiencing headaches to the point of speaking of life and death. Upon examining his pulse, I noted it was tense and large with multiple beats. I prescribed ginseng and white astragalus as the main ingredients, with safflower and dried tangerine peel as assistants. After five or six days with no improvement, everyone was astonished, thinking the medication was unsuitable. I said: The efficacy of the medicine follows a sequence; wait another one or two evenings, and things should stabilize. Suddenly, he returned that season asking why I hadn’t increased the astragalus.

<p>Then there was Chen from Yimen in Pujiang, over twenty years old, who developed a high fever in the autumn, felt thirsty, and had delusions—his illness seemed like the result of evil spirits. After seven or eight days, he called for me to treat him. Upon checking his pulse, I found both wrists strong, rapid, and full; he was plump, had a red face with a white hue, and wanted to expose his muscles. His pulse was inherently unsolid, due to cooling medicines. This was caused by overexertion leading to illness, and combined with warming tonics, he was restored.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essence of Surgery</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Qi Dezhi】</p>
<p><strong>On the Method of Correlating Colors and Pulses of the Body</strong></p>
<p>The principles of heaven and earth are known as Yin and Yang, which in humans manifest as blood and Qi. Blood represents nourishment, while Qi represents defense. Nourishment circulates within, while defense operates externally; thus, nourishment flows through the pulses, and defense circulates outside them. The pulse is the precursor to blood and Qi; without the pulse, how can there be nourishment within? Without the pulse, how can there be defense outside? These two support and move together, internally connecting with the five organs and six bowels, and externally flowing to the nine orifices, four limbs, and countless joints and hair. Day and night, they circulate ceaselessly, forming a continuous loop, converging at the source pulse, where changes manifest in the pulse. Therefore, it is said: &quot;Qi and blood are the essence of a person; the pulse is the essence of Qi and blood.&quot; Hence, in the beginning of treating illness, one must establish the five determinations based on the five organs&#39; colors and pulses. The pulse responds internally, and the color responds externally; therefore, colors and pulses must correlate with one another. It is said: &quot;Those who can unify colors and pulses achieve completeness.&quot; Thus, any physician must first skillfully understand the interplay of colors and pulses. If one does not excel in this, even if they are intelligent and knowledgeable, they are still unworthy of trust.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Introduction</strong> (Ming, Li Zhan)</p>
<p><strong>Observing Forms and Colors</strong></p>
<p>Observing forms and colors is to treat diseases before they manifest. When the organs are not exhausted, the vital energy and blood are not disturbed, and the spirit is not scattered, the person can fully recover; if the disease has already developed, there is partial recovery; if the disease has progressed, the situation is critical. </p>
<p>Firstly, observe the person&#39;s spirit and complexion, their moisture or dryness, and their plumpness or thinness, as well as their sleeping patterns. (Note: A plump and pale person often has excess phlegm and dampness, while a thin and dark person often has heat and fire. Sometimes, a person may be plump and dark, or thin and pale. Make observations based on the situation at hand, considering either form or color, without being overly rigid.)</p>
<p>Lively and moist beings are real, while dry and thin ones are weak, a knowledge passed down through the ages. If there is a deficiency in the body, one will likely feel lower back pain; knitting the brows indicates head pain and dizziness. Inability to lift one&#39;s hands signals shoulder and back pain, while difficulty walking suggests foot pain. Pressing the chest with crossed arms shows chest pain, and pressing the navel indicates connected abdominal pain. </p>
<p>Difficulty sleeping can accompany phlegm mixed with heat; excessive sleep may result from vacuity and coldness. Wall-sitting with a curled body suggests coldness, while lying flat and relaxed indicates heat. A yellow complexion indicates spleen dampness and heat, while bluish lips and a dark face reflect the same previous condition.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

<p>If a healthy person shows a floating, tight, and dry pulse akin to that of a febrile disease, though they have no headache, fever, or chills, they will soon fall ill and may die; this is called a &quot;walking corpse.&quot; Similarly, if someone exhibits frequent movements followed by a long halt, they may die within a year, even if they appear healthy. </p>
<p>For a patient with a strong pulse but a frail appearance, lacking spirit, suffering from spontaneous sweating and loss of appetite, with persistent diarrhea, these are signs of exhaustion. If their pulse remains strong despite their condition, they too may die. </p>
<p>When color and pulse correspond and the illness resolves, no treatment is needed. If the pulse contradicts the color and indicates a victorious interaction, the person will die; if it indicates a nourishing interaction, the illness will resolve on its own. Seasonal evils manifest in various forms, where evils from the past are considered real, and those that appear later are seen as unreal. For instance, in cases of red complexion associated with heat, phlegm-fire, mania, or rashes, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered. In cases of a greenish hue linked to liver issues, such as flank pain, dry heaving, or blood in the stool, the pulse should be taut and rapid.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The yellow hue indicates conditions of the spleen related to damp-heat, swelling, food injury, vomiting, diarrhea, and obstruction, and the pulse should be moderate and large. The white hue indicates lung conditions such as asthma, phlegm-fluid retention, weakness, and cough, and the pulse should be floating, thready, and short. The black hue indicates kidney conditions like lumbago, leg pain, hernia, turbidity in urination, and nocturnal emission, and the pulse should be deep, soft, and slippery. If there is excess activity, it corresponds to deficiency and heat; if there is stillness, it corresponds to cold and fullness, which should be consistent with the pulse. Additionally, for the five accumulations and six collections, careful observation of color and pulse evidence is especially necessary. Thus, red pulse corresponds to white pulse when discussing color-pulse relations. Moreover, the five colors align with the five organs, with green representing the interplay of yin and yang governing pathways.</p>
<p>Fat individuals have thick flesh and thus have a deep and firm pulse; thin individuals have less flesh and thus have a floating and long pulse. Short individuals should have a short and rapid pulse; tall individuals should have a spacious and long pulse. Discrepancies and oppositions that lack harmony lead to death. It is not only the physical shape that needs to correspond; even if the skin appears slippery, thready, wide, or tight, it should align with the pulse as well. The classics state that a pulse of a certain number of beats corresponds to skin of the same condition: a rapid pulse relates to fast skin, a hurried pulse relates to hasty skin, a slow pulse relates to relaxed skin, a thready pulse relates to thready skin, and a slippery pulse relates to slippery skin.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Principles: Six Essentials<br>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi)</p>
<p><strong>Observation Method</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, the legendary physician Xuan Qi, out of compassion for the suffering of the people, sought hidden truths, traced origins, and laid down methods to benefit future generations. He established the four diagnostic methods of observation, listening, inquiry, and palpation, to determine the yin and yang, surface and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess, life and death, fortune and misfortune. Nowadays, people rely solely on pulse diagnosis to prescribe medicine; how can this be without error? Moreover, in wealthy households, women stay behind curtains and cover their arms with silk, lacking the ability to be observed for their complexion and heard for their voice, and they cannot fully utilize the art of pulse examination, nor engage in thorough inquiry. Patients often dislike the complexity of the process, considering it overly tedious, resulting in some not taking their prescribed medicine. Testing the doctor with one&#39;s illness and testing the medicine with one&#39;s life lead the physician to undervalue human life, recklessly employing arbitrary discussion—does this not lead to mutual loss? In essence, a physician must guard life. If discerning and meticulous observation and treatment are not employed, and principles are harmed, this is not the approach of a humane person. From the &quot;Suwen&quot; and &quot;Lingshu&quot; onwards, all works of wisdom through the ages contain pieces of knowledge that can be foundational for the four diagnostic methods. If future practitioners are willing to delve deeply and appreciate this work, they will understand pulse diagnosis with the clarity reminiscent of ice. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;By observation, one understands it, perceiving its five colors to know the illness.&quot;<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The liver is signified by the color blue, the lungs by white, the heart by red, the kidneys by black, and the spleen by yellow. When one is ill, the complexion must change and this will be evident on the face. The lungs govern qi; if qi is deficient, the complexion turns white. The kidneys belong to water; if water is depleted, the face becomes dark. Blue indicates anger that harms the liver, while red signifies fiery excess in the heart. Yellow suggests internal damage to the spleen and stomach; purple and muddy imply external invasion of evil pathogens. If one is haggard and dark, it indicates profound melancholy and deep-seated emotional distress; if thin and pale, it results from prolonged illness and bodily weakness. A bright root of the nose indicates a desire for recovery; a dark ring around the mouth suggests a critical kidney condition. </p>
<p>Indeed, internal conditions manifest externally; observing the surface reveals the inner state. Examining the features of the brows and eyes reveals the condition of the lungs and liver. When the six hollow organs are obstructed, the feet grow cold and shrink. When the five internal organs suffer from obstruction, there is unrestrained discharge leading to numbness in the limbs. Heart disease that affects the lungs may lead to death; typically, one first experiences heart pain followed by coughing. Liver ailments affecting the spleen can also be fatal; usually, this begins with pain in the sides and results in swelling and diarrhea. Spleen ailments affecting the kidneys may lead to death; this often starts with diarrhea and follows with dysentery. Kidney afflictions affecting the heart can be deadly; it typically begins with pain in the lower back followed by heart distress and related symptoms. Lung ailments affecting the liver can be fatal; it usually begins with coughing and follows with pain in the sides, and the pulse is string-like and thin.</p>
<p>The human body fundamentally consists of form, and what fills that form is qi. When form surpasses qi, there is premature death; this is marked by being plump and pale. When qi surpasses form, there is longevity; those who are slender, dark, lean, and spirited exemplify this. A surplus of form indicates excess, along with the presence of harmful qi. Emaciation suggests deficiency, indicating weakness in the righteous qi.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Observation, Listening, Inquiry, and Palpation</strong>  </p>
<p>The four terms: Observation, Listening, Inquiry, and Palpation, truly represent the essence of medicine. If one grasps the significance of these four words, they can be considered profound in the field of medicine. Contemporary practitioners often focus solely on Inquiry, with only a superficial understanding of Observation and Listening. As for Palpation, it is viewed as the least important among the three, leading to a scarcity of those skilled in it. Even when mentioned, it typically revolves around concepts of the heart, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, and kidneys. Without distinguishing these positions, how can one discern the nuances of deficiency and excess, life and death? Little do they realize that the key lies in the effectiveness of Palpation. The first three—Observation, Listening, and Inquiry—serve to uncover the beginning of the illness, which is then confirmed through Palpation at the pulse, enabling one to ascertain the source of the illness, its current location in any organ or channel, whether it is deficient or excessive, whether it leads to death or survival. The careful analysis of treatment must rely on Palpation, thus ensuring effective treatment plans can be devised. This order of practice—first approaching the patient, observing, then listening, followed by inquiry, and ultimately Palpation—reflects a logic that is not easily accomplished. Can we therefore dismiss the importance of Palpation? I record this to provide guidance for those in the know.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Basic Guidelines for Observing Color</strong></p>
<p>When diagnosing febrile illnesses, one must first observe the color. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: sounds correspond to the five tones, colors correspond to the five elements; when the sounds and colors match, one can understand the diseases of the five organs. The liver’s color is green, and its sound is a call; the lung’s color is white, and its sound is weeping; the heart’s color is red, and its sound is laughter; the spleen’s color is yellow, and its sound is singing; the kidney’s color is black, and its sound is groaning. Furthermore, the colors of the four seasons are beneficial when they support each other, but adverse when they conflict. For example, green and red appear in spring, red and yellow in summer, yellow and white in late summer, white and black in autumn, and black and green in winter; these are the harmonious colors. However, if the liver disease presents as green and white, heart disease as red and black, spleen disease as yellow and green, lung disease as white and red, and kidney disease as black and yellow, these conflicts among the five elements signify difficulties in treatment.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In terms of the heat of the five internal organs, the colors seen on the face are as follows: if there is liver heat, the left cheek turns red first; if there is lung heat, the right cheek turns red first; if there is heart heat, the complexion turns red first; if there is spleen heat, the nose turns red first; if there is kidney heat, the jaw turns red first. As for a dark face, it indicates coldness; a blue face indicates wind-cold; blue and black indicate wind, cold, and pain; yellow and white suggest dampness, heat, and disharmony of qi; blue and white indicate wind, qi stagnation, cold, and pain. Generally speaking, if dark qi appears on the face, it often signifies severe illness; if dark qi appears bright and moist, it indicates life, while if it is dark and dry, it indicates death. This is a brief overview of the key points. The &quot;Neijing&quot; utilizes the five colors for subtle diagnosis that can be observed visually. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that to observe and understand is called insight. Therefore, color must not be neglected. In examining for exogenous cold, one must first observe the pulse and color, then palpate the pulse and carefully assess the evidence to decide matters of life and death, good and bad fortune.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a></p></div>

Things that nourish and promote are auspicious, while those that conflict and weaken are inauspicious. Those that thrive are alive, while those that wither and perish are dead. In the areas of the forehead, life expectancy, destiny, commanding lines, and the philtrum, there are signs of Qi; a complexion that is nourished and bright is auspicious, while one that is dark and dry is inauspicious. Furthermore, one should understand the principles of growth and decline through the four seasons. Here, I will briefly outline the key signs of a cold attack related to the five colors on the left for easy reference. Blue belongs to wood, signifies wind, cold, and pain, and is the color of the liver channel (Foot Jueyin). If the face and lips are blue, it indicates extreme yin. If the tongue is rolled and the throat is constricted, it is advisable to warm urgently. If it is a case of cold attacking with Yin involvement, leading to lower abdominal pain, the face will also appear blue.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a></p></div>

<p>Red is associated with fire, representing heat; it is the color of the hand’s Shaoyin Heart. In cases of cold, there are distinctions between three Yang and one Yin. The foot’s Taiyang is associated with water, appearing black when cold and red when hot. It is said that when the facial complexion is bright red, it indicates Yang qi stagnation on the surface and that sweating has not occurred, so it should be induced. If the pulse is floating and rapid, showing surface heat, and there is no sweating, the face appears red and radiant. It is stated that when a Yangming disease has a red complexion, it should not be attacked directly. The term &quot;coalesce&quot; implies communication; this means that surface pathogens remain unresolved and should not be attacked internally. However, if Yangming is internally full, with an aversion to heat but not to cold, or if there are steaming heat or afternoon tidal heat, with constipation and a red face accompanied by delirium, this indicates true internal heat and may be attacked.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a></p></div>

In cases of Shaoyang syndrome, where heat is between the exterior and interior, with a red face and wiry pulse, one should use Xiaochaihu Decoction to harmonize, and do not purgative. The classics say in Shaoyin syndrome, diarrhea of clear grains occurs, with internal cold and external heat, and a red face; thus, use Si Ni Decoction with scallions as the primary treatment. This represents extreme internal yin cold, pushing the floating fire upward to the face, resulting in redness, which is not heat. If one does not examine carefully and mistakenly administers cold cooling agents, it may lead to death; one must be cautious! Furthermore, if there&#39;s a combination of yin injury and cold with floating yang conditions, the face can also appear red, but if the feet are cold and the pulse is deep, this indicates restlessness. A red face with cold feet and a deep pulse where one cannot drink water indicates extreme yin, and warmth is needed.

<p>For any patient whose body is light and can easily turn, treatment is straightforward; however, if the body is heavy and cannot turn, treatment is difficult. It is known that with yin conditions, the body is heavy, and the feet are cold, leading to a curled-up position.

Additionally, a yin toxicity manifests as pain in the body like being struck, feeling heavy as if under a mountain, and unable to turn.</p>
<p>When influenced by dampness or wind, the body often feels heavy and painful, resulting in an inability to move side to side; it is essential to differentiate these conditions. Generally, in yang conditions, the body feels light, the hands and feet are warm, and the eyes are open with a desire to see others, indicating a chance for treatment. If the head feels heavy and vision is obscured, it suggests a disturbance of the heavenly pillar bone and the depletion of vital energy.</p>
<p>In cases of epidemic diseases, when feeling the clothes or touching the bed results in grasping air with two hands, this indicates the spirit has departed and the soul is in chaos. Generally, for patients with moist and supple skin, there is hope for recovery; for those with dry skin, the prognosis is poor. The classics state: if the pulse is floating and surging, the body sweats profusely like oil, there is incessant wheezing, and the body feels numb—sometimes calm and sometimes agitated—this signals imminent death. </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Observing Colors</strong></p>
<p>Among the five organs and numerous bones of a person, the spirit resides in the ears. Color is the banner of the spirit. When the spirit is strong, the color is vibrant; when the spirit is weak, the color fades; when the spirit is hidden, the color dims; when the spirit is exposed, the color shines. The color of emperors is marked with dragon patterns and phoenix hues. The color of immortals reflects the brilliance of mountain greens. The glory of wealth shines like pearls and the luster of jade. The color of longevity and old age resembles the ancient cypress and the deep green of pines. Even the colors of poverty and early demise are heavy, murky, and stifled, lacking vitality and appearing dull and dark; all these reveal themselves on the face.</p>
<p>For illnesses arising from within, how should their visible colors be interpreted? The “Inner Canon” emphasizes the importance of observing the face in discerning colors. Yellow on the face with various eye colors—be it green, red, white, or black—indicates survival; however, blue faces with red eyes, red faces with white eyes, blue faces with black eyes, black faces with white eyes, and red faces with green eyes all indicate death. This is because yellow represents the central hue of the earth; if a patient’s face displays yellow, unhindered by other colors, it is auspicious. A face lacking yellow but instead tainted by other colors suggests misfortune. Although the color yellow in the eyes, regardless of its depth and warmth, should not be hastily judged regarding life and death. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the colors reflecting the virtues and vices of the five organs reveal themselves on the face, distributed among the forehead, cheeks, nose, and jaw. The “Needling Heat” chapter states that for those with liver heat, the left cheek becomes red first; for heart heat, the forehead turns red first; for spleen heat, the nose reddens first; for lung heat, the right cheek shows redness first; and for kidney heat, the jaw reddens first. Even if the illness has not yet erupted, redness should be needled, which is referred to as treating illness before it manifests. Thus, the colors indicating the conditions of the five organs observed on the face warrant careful examination, not only concerning heat-related illnesses.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, there is further insight, namely the brightness of the eyes and the brilliance of the nose. The classic states that the five colors of brightness represent the essence of qi. These five colors manifest above the essence of the five organs, changing among the brightness; certain colors signify good, while others signify evil, allowing for foresight. The colors seen on the face correspond to their respective positions—above, below, left, and right—each with its significance. Thus, the brilliance around the nose provides a means to discern these colors&#39; oppositions, as well as those of the genders, making it crucial. The subtleties of color observation are unparalleled.</p>
<p>Zhongjing further proposed a profound principle, with the key being the central nasal bridge, which serves as the celestial cornerstone and the earthly central peak. The pathological energies of the four organs—wood, metal, water, and fire—must converge upon the central soil. For instance, when the tip of the nose appears blue, and there is internal suffering of cold pain in the abdomen, it denotes death. This remark stands out through the ages; later generations lament the absence of “On Sudden Illness,” unable to trace its origins, unaware that this statement captures its essence.</p>
<p>The blue color of the liver&#39;s wood within the Ying Yin corresponds with the coldness of the kidney&#39;s water; it manifests at the nose and reflects in the abdomen, resulting in sudden illness leading to death. A slightly darkened tip of the nose indicates the presence of water energy, interlinking with the previous statement. Although black signifies the yin of the kidneys, a slight darkness without abdominal pain indicates water energy rather than sudden illness. A yellow hue denotes coldness in the chest, where “cold” often implies phlegm within the context of “Treatise on Cold Damage,” suggesting accumulation of phlegm in the chest. A white hue indicates loss of blood; white is associated with the lungs, which govern the upper jiao, and when the vital flow is insufficient, the nose becomes pale, indicating blood loss.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that if one sees a faint red that is not in season, it indicates death; the color of fire returns to the earth. Why hastily conclude death? However, if there is an abnormal qi not in its proper time, then the fire is not the fire that nourishes the soil, but rather the fire that overcomes metal, leading to internal dryness and consequently death. </p>
<p>Next, regarding the observation of the eyes, it is stated that if the pupils are perfectly round, it signifies that paralysis cannot be treated. Following this, we examine the five facial colors: a blue color indicates pain; a black color indicates labor; a red color indicates wind; a yellow color indicates constipation; a bright color indicates retention of fluids. Furthermore, a yellow color indicates coldness in the chest. </p>
<p>Each observation corresponds with the &quot;Neijing,&quot; supplementing what is lacking, and thus it may be used as a method and transmitted. </p>
<p>The good colors are: blue like emerald feathers, red like a rooster&#39;s comb, yellow like a crab&#39;s belly, white like pig fat, and black like crow feathers. The bad colors are: blue like grass, red like magenta blood, yellow like bitter oranges, black like soot, and white like dry bones. The five organs show good colors when they possess essence and vitality; when devoid of it, the color is adverse. Initially, one does not take blue and black as major taboos. </p>
<p>If one sees a bad color before illness, illness is bound to be severe. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that red appearing on both cheekbones, as large as a thumb, signifies that even a minor illness will inevitably lead to death. Black appearing at the forehead, also as large as a thumb, indicates certain death without any prior illness. The meaning correlates with the facial colors appearing in the upper, lower, left, and right regions of the ming tang (the space between the eyebrows), and this is indeed a sign of a sudden illness.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all these are without illness; why then are they regarded with surprise? However, there is a method for observing colors, which has its transmission. Qibo says that if the condition arises from the heart, it appears as white wrapped around red; if from the lungs, as white wrapped around bright red; if from the liver, as white wrapped around dark blue; if from the spleen, as white wrapped around gourd fruit; and if from the kidneys, as white wrapped around purple. White is fine silk, layered upon red, bright red, dark blue, yellow, and purple; the inner colors shine through to the outside, appearing both hidden and visible. The complexion reflects what is within the flesh; how can it be different from this? Thus, the subtleties of observing colors are entirely based on observing the spirit. Blood nourishes qi, and qi nourishes the spirit; when illness occurs, these aspects become intertwined. A person who loses sleep shows a hungry spirit; a child who has lost a parent shows a dull spirit, as their qi is no longer nourished by the spirit. When a child develops smallpox, an intense inner fire is in motion, and the eyes first show a crystalline light without waiting for the pox to develop. A strong dose of water is used to counter the sunlight, allowing the toxic fire to emerge in a thin line, preventing it from spreading wildly and avoiding disaster. Such insights are rarely recorded throughout history, hence the intention to document them.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To diagnose an illness without understanding the importance of observing color is like a boatman unfamiliar with the winds and currents, liable to face capsizing and drowning. This negligence indicates the faults of the physician.</p>
<p>The method of analyzing color and pulse is of utmost importance, as entrusted by the sages, serving as the authority in treating ailments. Color is what the eyes perceive, and pulse is what the hands hold; when combined, they go beyond mere sight and touch, fundamentally relying on the spiritual heart. The Inner Canon states that ancient practitioners skillfully assessed the color and pulse to connect with divine insights, harmonizing with the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—along with the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, always adhering to the constant principles. Thus, the significance of color and pulse can discern divine signs, linking the interplay of the elements and seasons, while the variations of winds and patterns do not stray from their regular cycles. This allows for predictions of changes in health, not to mention the mechanisms of illness in the human body. It further explains that the shifts in color correspond with the pulses of the four seasons—this is what the divine deems precious for connecting with spiritual clarity.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a></p></div>

Thus, one can remain constantly far from death and close to life. Is it not worthy of great value to stay this way? As for the skilled diagnostician, they observe the color and feel the pulse, first distinguishing yin and yang, examining clarity and turbidity to comprehend the parts. They look at the breathing and listen to the voice to understand the source of suffering, observing the balance and proportions, measuring dimensions, and scrutinizing the rise and fall, smoothness, and complexity to ascertain the origin of the illness. This is derived from the interplay of color and pulse to engage with observation, breath, and sound, seeking the origin of the illness in the heights and depths, both inside and outside. It is indeed subtle and refined! It cannot merely be the path of the average person; hence there are distinctions among the superior, middle, and inferior practitioners. The superior practitioner achieves perfection nine out of ten times, the middle practitioner seven out of ten, and the inferior practitioner six out of ten.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a></p></div>

The pulses of the five organs are: Spring is springy, Summer is hooked, Autumn is downy, and Winter is stony. Strong pulses indicate excess, while weak pulses indicate deficiency. In each season, if the stomach is balanced it indicates health; if the stomach is diminished it indicates illness, and if there is no stomach it indicates death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Integrating the colors of the pulse and reflecting upon them, is this not something clear and easy to follow? Zhongjing also introduced a convenient method, stating that the motion of the pulse at the inch is dependent on its appropriate time. For instance, if the liver’s color is green but appears white, then at that time, all visible pulse colors indicate illness. The pulses of both hands belong to the Taiyin channels, collectively called the inch pulse, and when they are active according to their appropriate time, the liver&#39;s dominant color should be green, with the pulse reflecting a subtle tension. If it appears white instead, it indicates a superficial pulse, and if it fails to endure during its critical time, it leads to demise. Only when the natural dominant color of the pulse is green and tense can one align with the rightful spring season. Moreover, any appearance of a white superficial pulse is a sign of malevolent forces, as are the colors red, yellow, or black, indicating that these pulses should be treated as illness, though with distinctions of severity. The Classic of Internal Medicine has detailed these principles, and Zhongjing further measured them with the golden needle.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating diseases, if one does not correctly analyze the colors and pulses, and confuses the findings, gaining one aspect while losing another, achieving partial understanding while neglecting the whole, one is merely a mediocre practitioner. When faced with a case, if clarity is lacking and the practitioner does not possess skill and judgment, the fault lies with the physician.</p>
<p>In treating diseases, if one fails to observe the four easy and difficult principles, it is a mistake.</p>
<p>In general treatment, one must combine observation of color, pulse, and careful examination. The easy and difficult aspects are as clear as a palm&#39;s lines. A rough practitioner does not differentiate between the easy and the difficult and may even perceive ease where there is difficulty; this is the fault of the physician. Observing the physical condition, energy, color, pulse, the old and new states of the illness, and timing for treatment, when the physical condition and energy are in harmony, this is deemed treatable. A bright and moist color indicates ease in treatment. The pulse reflecting the four seasons indicates treatability. A weak yet slippery pulse signifies a balanced stomach qi and is called easy to treat. When energy and form are in harmony, it is treatable. Color and energy that are bright and nourished signify ease in treatment. The pulse should follow the four seasons; thus, it is treatable. A weak yet slippery pulse, with a suitable stomach qi, signifies ease. </p>
<p>When the physical condition and energy are discordant, it is deemed difficult to treat. A color that is pale and lacks moisture is called difficult. A firm and solid pulse signals a serious condition. A pulse that contradicts the four seasons is unmanageable. One must carefully investigate the four difficulties and make clear declarations. When the form and energy do not complement each other, with pale and withered color lacking clarity, alongside a firm pulse without stomach qi, and a pulse deviating from seasonal norms, these four conditions are not treatable. Due to their difficulty, one must make this clear. A mediocre practitioner&#39;s easy cases have often gone unchecked.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The treatment of illnesses without recognizing the distinctions between new and old conditions</p>
<p>In treating illnesses, if one fails to discern the nature of new and old diseases, whether chronic or acute, and loses the correct order in urgency, the responsibilities fall upon the physician. When the pulse is small and does not diminish in color, it indicates a new illness. This suggests that the vital energy is weak, yet the spirit remains strong. When the pulse diminishes in color, it indicates a chronic illness. In this case, although the spirit may persist, the pathogenic influence overwhelms the righteous energies. When the pulse and all five colors are both diminished, this signifies a chronic illness. In such a scenario, both spirit and energy are weakened. Conversely, when the pulse and five colors are not diminished, it points to a new illness, indicating that both spirit and energy are robust. New illnesses should be treated urgently, while chronic illnesses should be addressed more cautiously. </p>
<p>If the internal organs have already deteriorated, their color will inevitably appear decrepit, and this will ultimately lead to death. Indeed, color reflects the spirit, while the organs serve as its residence. When the spirit departs, the organs deteriorate. When the organs deteriorate, their color displays decrepitude and aversion.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a></p></div>

<p>Fat people have more dampness, while thin people have more heat. Those with more dampness have loose tissue, making it easier for external pathogens to invade; those with more heat have tight tissue, making it harder for external pathogens to intrude. Excess dampness leads to internal relaxation with less harm; excess heat leads to internal dryness, which is prone to internal injury.<br>— <em>Complete Works of Jingyue</em> by Zhang Jiebin, Ming Dynasty  </p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Pulse Colors of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The color of the pulse reflects the state of blood and qi. If the form is correct, the reflection is correct; if the form is crooked, the reflection is crooked. Disease originates internally, thus the pulse color will inevitably reveal itself externally. Therefore, when examining a patient, one must first clarify the pulse color. However, the way of pulse color cannot be fully expressed in mere words; to grasp its essence, it relies on the four aspects of yin, yang, deficiency, and excess. If there is no distinction among the four, all is well. In general, a pulse that is surging and smooth is considered solid and yang, while a weak pulse is considered deficient and yin. This does not need further explanation. However, Zhongjing states that if the pulse is floating and large, then qi is solid and blood is deficient. Tao Jiemian states that regardless of whether the pulse is floating, sinking, large, or small, if there is no strength detectable under pressure, and heavy pressing yields none, it is indicative of a yin condition. The <em>Inner Canon</em> defines a pulse that is four times larger as a crucial sign of true deficiency; thus, a slippery and large pulse is not necessarily yang.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a></p></div>

In summary, when seeking the pulse, one must discern Yin and Yang through strength or weakness, and assess whether there is spirit or not to discern reality from emptiness. A gentle pulse indicates the arrival of vital energy, while a strong and harsh pulse signals the approach of evil energy. When illness reaches a critical stage, one must observe the ebb and flow of vital energy and the advance and retreat of evils; the relationship between life and death depends entirely on this. This principle is extremely subtle and is not easily understood, so I will outline its essentials. To diagnose illness, one must not only understand the cause but also observe the pulse, color, and sound, analyzing them together to ascertain the truth of emptiness and fullness, Yin and Yang.

Heaven is fundamentally unified, yet viewed in this manner, there is the &quot;heaven of heaven,&quot; which refers to the heaven that gives life to us, born from the void and derived from heaven. There is also the &quot;heaven of humanity,&quot; which refers to the heaven that shapes us, formed from existence and grounded in ourselves. The act of being born is prior, and the act of being shaped is subsequent, thus the meanings of pre-heaven and post-heaven are revealed here. </p>
<p>Therefore, speaking of human endowments, those endowed pre-heavenly strong and robust tend to live longer, while those weak in pre-heaven are more prone to early death. Those who are cultivated post-heaven live longer still, while those who are diminished post-heaven face even earlier demise. </p>
<p>As for bones, they are pre-heaven; muscles are post-heaven. The spirit is also pre-heaven; appearance is post-heaven. In terms of coloration, those who are pale tend to live long, while those who are tender are more likely to perish early. Among the tender, those with some pallor are fortunate; among the pale, those with some tenderness are unfortunate. </p>
<p>In terms of sound, fullness brings longevity, while timidity leads to early death. Although slender and long sounds are unlucky, although loud and abrupt sounds are also unlucky. Differentiating physical forms, sturdiness leads to longevity, while fragility results in early demise. A body may be thin and weak yet capable of endurance is fortunate, while a body may be strong yet easily fatigued is unfortunate.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Movement and stillness have their distinctions; stillness leads to longevity, while restlessness results in premature death. Although nature may appear urgent, those who find harmony within urgency will be fortunate. Though the Yang seems thick, those who contain subtlety within thickness face misfortune. </p>
<p>Regarding the distinction of youth and age, the young may seem weak at first, but gradual growth leads to strength—this is the mark of later accomplishments. When assessing temperament, the youthful and flashy are easily filled; this is a sign of early decline. Thus, those who encompass both heaven and earth surely enjoy longevity. Those who lose their principles in both early and late phases will experience short lives without foreknowledge.</p>
<p>If we speak of human agency, the strength from nature should not be relied upon recklessly; doing so will only lead to its loss. The naturally weaker should exercise caution; with caution, one can overcome destiny. Caution means guarding one’s emotions to protect the mind, being mindful of seasonal changes to safeguard lung energy, being restrained with indulgences to protect the liver and kidneys, and avoiding excessive labor and food to preserve the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Only joy can nurture life; those who desire happiness should strive for goodness. Only blessings can ensure existence; those who seek blessings must not deceive the divine. As long as there is no internal loss, how can afflictions invade? And is not the power of heaven and earth within our grasp? Therefore, &quot;Guangchengzi&quot; says: Do not exhaust your body, do not agitate your essence; then one can attain longevity. How profound this is! The essence of these words is complete.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Observing Colors</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;To observe and know is called spirit.&quot; Therefore, observing colors is the primary principle in treating people. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; text states: The five colors correspond to the five organs: green for the liver, red for the heart, white for the lungs, yellow for the spleen, and black for the kidneys. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: The qi of the five organs manifests in color; if it appears green like grass, it indicates death; yellow like bitter orange indicates death; black like soot indicates death; red like fresh blood indicates death; and white like withered bones indicates death. These are the signs of death in the five colors. If it appears green like emerald feathers, it indicates life; red like a rooster&#39;s comb indicates life; yellow like a crab&#39;s abdomen indicates life; white like pig fat indicates life; and black like crow&#39;s feathers indicates life. These are the signs of life in the five colors. </p>
<p>Life manifests in the heart as if wrapped in white cloth over red; in the lungs as if wrapped in white cloth over red; in the liver as if wrapped in white cloth over blue; in the spleen as if wrapped in white cloth over gourd; and in the kidneys as if wrapped in white cloth over purple. These are the external manifestations of the five organs. The &quot;Neijing&quot; divides colors into three categories of health, sickness, and death. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; further divides the internal organs into distinct sections, with methodologies that address the surface level and depth, as well as vitality and dispersion, signifying the importance of this principle. I briefly outline its essence: The five colors possess brightness; they shine brilliantly. The five colors have substance; they are moist and lustrous.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Light is formless and represents Yang, which governs Qi; the body has form and represents Yin, which governs blood. When both Qi and blood are depleted, their colors become dark, dull, and withered. This is exemplified by the five conditions known as grass, bitter orange, roasted blood, dry bones, and bones that are shriveled. If Qi and blood still exist, their colors are bright and moist, represented by the five conditions of green feathers, cockscomb, crab abdomen, pig fat, and black feathers. Although these five colors can still be generated, they ultimately correspond to an excessive color of one organ, which leads to harm and illness, not balance.</p>
<p>A healthy person with harmonious organs will have the color of one organ that awaits its dominant one, beginning to flourish outwardly. This outward flourishing is nourished by stomach Qi, appearing in the skin and fur. The color of stomach Qi is yellow, while the color of the skin and fur is white, hence it is said to resemble being wrapped in white cloth. A white cloth wraps is hazy with luminosity; although there is shape and shadow, it is not yet radiant, stemming from the harmony of Qi and blood, the absence of conflict between Yin and Yang, and the balance among the five organs.</p>
<p>If not, should the five organs decline, the previously hazy color changes to an excessive one; the previously bright color turns to murkiness; the previously moist color becomes withered. Eventually, murkiness and withering combine, resulting in destruction. Should there be no light within, and Qi and blood of Yin and Yang be completely severed, one cannot hope to survive!<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Color and Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>To treat illness, it is essential to observe color, which requires examining the face, with each part having its significance. The two eyebrows on the face correspond to the lungs; if they appear red, it indicates fire; if blue, wind; if yellow, dampness; if black, pain; and if white, coldness. The area between the eyes, known as the &quot;ming tang,&quot; corresponds to the heart. Below the ming tang, at the nose, corresponds to the liver, with the sides of the liver representing the gallbladder. The tip of the nose corresponds to the spleen, while the sides of the nose correspond to the stomach. The area above the cheeks corresponds to the kidneys, while above the kidneys corresponds to the large intestine. The liver and gallbladder correspond to the sides of the nose and the small intestine. The area above the lungs corresponds to the forehead, which relates to the throat. The forehead corresponds to the head and face, and the area beside the heart relates to the &quot;dan zhong.&quot; Below the nose at the &quot;ren zhong&quot; corresponds to the bladder, while the &quot;san jiao&quot; has no specific location: the upper jiao resides in the lungs, the middle jiao in the liver, and the lower jiao in the bladder. Other locations correspond precisely to the &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; The five colors correspond to their respective organs and can be evaluated to diagnose illness, similar to the method used to diagnose lung conditions, all being remarkably effective. However, there are interactions of generation and overcoming: for instance, if blue appears with yellow, wood overcomes earth; if red appears with black, water overcomes fire. If yellow appears with red, fire generates earth; and if black appears with white, metal generates water.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who conquer die, and those who live continue to live. The method of treatment is as follows: the conqueror saves their life, while the living control their conqueror. Otherwise, the illness cannot be quickly resolved. There are those who manifest internally and those who manifest externally. The internally manifesting ones wish to resolve but do not wish to hide; the externally manifesting ones desire to deepen but do not wish to disperse. The ones that wish to resolve indicate a light illness, while those that wish to deepen indicate a severe illness. The method of treatment is to assist the resolving ones with their uprightness and to drive away the deep ones with their evil; otherwise, the illness cannot swiftly decline. But how do we differentiate between internal and external? The colors that are dark and turbid belong to the internal, while those that are light and lustrous belong to the external. Once the five colors appear in specific locations, one must carefully observe their heaviness or lightness to understand the depth of the illness; one must closely examine whether they are dry or moist to perceive the life or death of the illness; one must meticulously distinguish between gathering and dispersing to know the close or distant nature of the illness; one must attentively observe the up and down to discern the nature of the organs involved in the illness. The most subtle aspect is in observing whether the five colors possess spirit or lack spirit. A dark color with spirit can still sustain life even in severe illness; a bright color lacking spirit can lead to death even without illness. But how do we discern the presence or absence of spirit? This is determined by the yellow and brightness of the color. If the color is yellow and has shine, hidden beneath the skin and hair, even if the distinction among colors is visible, there is no worry. This method of observing spirit is something one must know!<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the internal organs are full and the qi is abundant, but the person is fearful, their voice sounds as if it comes from within a room; this is the dampness of the middle qi. [Note: The kidneys are the water organ, receiving and storing the essence of the five organs. If the kidneys do not store, then the internal organs will be overfilled. Fear pertains to the will of the kidneys; if the kidneys do not store but instead exceed their limits, they will harm their will. When qi is abundant and harms fear, the essence will also leak outward; hence it is called the dampness of the middle qi. The voice sounding as if from within a room means the sound is not loud, and the voice does not project outward.]</p>
<p>When one speaks in a faint voice and repeats words throughout the day, this drains the qi. [Note: Faint refers to the sound and breath being frail. Repeating words all day long indicates a lack of continuity in the qi. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: in reality, it is delirious speech, in emptiness, it is the Zheng voice. Zheng voice refers to heavy speech.]</p>

<p>The flavor of salt is salty, and its essence causes fluids in the body to leak out.

All of these are said to not be in harmony with the divinity. When a sickness is profound, the voice is wheezy.

<p>[Note: The salty flavor of salt is inherently moistening; when placed in a vessel, its essence rises and causes fluids to leak over the vessel. Similarly, when a string is about to snap, its sound must first become harsh. When the energy of wood disperses, its leaves emerge early. All three of these conditions correlate to the wheeziness stemming from internal damage, which manifests in sound. The symptoms of wheeziness can arise from three causes: one is when the lung qi rebels and wishes to come up from the stomach; the prescription is tangerine peel and bamboo shavings soup, which addresses the rebellious symptom; another cause is when wheezing occurs alongside abdominal fullness, requiring an examination of the areas before and after to understand where the obstruction lies, leading to resolution, which is the substantial symptom; lastly, if one experiences all three signs and wheezes, it is a sign of deterioration. This is due to a deep-seated sickness that has already damaged the stomach and intestines; even poisonous substances cannot remedy the interior, and short needles cannot address the exterior, resulting in a scorched surface, wounded muscles, and stagnation of energy and blood leading to decay. &quot;Black&quot; indicates a color of corruption.]<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a></p></div>

If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;jiao&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the liver. The heart&#39;s sound is laughter, corresponding to the &quot;zheng&quot; tone, harmonious and prolonged. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;zheng&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the heart. The spleen&#39;s sound is song, corresponding to the &quot;gong&quot; tone, vast and harmonious. If the sound and tone align, there is no illness; if the &quot;gong&quot; is chaotic, the disease resides in the spleen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiating Between Excess and Deficiency of Qi</strong></p>
<p>When external injuries are caused by wind and cold, the qi becomes obstructed and abundant; when internal injuries arise from food intake and labor, the respiration through the mouth and nose is short and insufficient. How can this be distinguished? Those who are afflicted by wind and cold initially do not have any decrease in heart and lung&#39;s original qi, yet the presence of evil qi exacerbates the condition, leading to nasal blockage and poor flow, causing the face to redden and obstructing the nasal qi from exiting, which then comes out through the mouth. When such a person speaks, their words tend to be light at the beginning and heavy at the end. Their voice is strong, loud, and vigorous. In the case of febrile illness, the nose is dry and non-secreting, the face is red and congested, and the speech is light at the start and heavy at the end, with a strong and loud voice, indicating an excess condition. In a case of a cold, there will be a clear nasal discharge, a hoarse voice, and speech that sounds as if it is coming from a jar, also exhibiting lightness at the beginning and heaviness at the end, high and strong, again indicating excess. In contrast, those with internal injuries from food intake and labor suffer an initial loss of qi in their heart and lungs, resulting from heat injury. Once the heat harms the qi, the limbs become weak and unable to move, thus causing short and insufficient breaths from the mouth and nose, leading to fatigue and a tendency to speak little. When questioned, they often do not wish to respond at all; even if they force themselves to answer, their energy is weak and their voice low, indicating a deficiency of qi. With such clarity, even women and girls can discern these conditions. How could physicians be unable to differentiate them?<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Six Essentials of Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>Voice Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: By hearing the five sounds, one understands the illness. Each of the five organs corresponds to one of the five sounds: the liver corresponds to the “jiao,” the heart to the “zheng,” the spleen to the “gong,” the lungs to the “shang,” and the kidneys to the “yu.” However, this meaning is profound and not easily approximated by the ordinary. Now, I will gather the ancient and modern experiences and simplified methods to the left and name it &quot;Voice Diagnosis.&quot;</p>
<p>The groan of the pulse indicates pain, referring to groaning during diagnosis. A slow voice indicates wind, which is akin to today’s wind diseases. A voice that sounds as if it is coming from inside a room indicates dampness in the qi. If the speech is faint and only resumes after a long pause, this indicates a loss of qi, where the qi is weak and not connecting properly, leading to interruptions in speech. If clothing is not properly gathered and speech is filled with insults, disregarding relationships, this indicates disruption of the spirit, akin to manic wind. A lazy and timid manner of speaking, first light then heavy, reflects internal injury due to insufficient original qi.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When speaking loudly and forcefully, starting with emphasis and then becoming light, it indicates a strong external pathogenic factor. Frowning and groaning signifies pain in the head. Yelling while pressing one&#39;s heart indicates pain in the center of the abdomen. Groaning and being unable to turn over suggests back pain. Shaking one’s head while touching the jaw indicates pain in the lips and teeth. Groaning and being unable to rise suggests pain in the waist and legs. Slowness in movement indicates pain in the waist and legs. If a patient sighs during examination, it suggests stagnation. Shaking the head while speaking indicates internal pain. Sudden hoarseness can result from wind, phlegm, or excessive anger. Sitting and being short of breath suggests phlegm-heat asthma. Stammering or unclear speech suggests wind-phlegm. Middle-aged individuals with a hoarse voice indicate phlegm-heat. If a patient speaks to themselves during examination, with disorganized thoughts, it results from mental strain. In cases of severe cold damage leading to hoarseness due to emotional disturbance, ulcers on the upper lip mean parasitic infection of the internal organs; ulcers on the lower lip indicate infestation in the anal region. If a person is short of breath and cannot take a full breath, they are severely deficient. A person without cold or heat, but who is short of breath, indicates an excess condition, likely due to phlegm-heat.</p>
<p>Listening to voices helps discern fortunes and misfortunes.</p>
<p>A hoarse, pale voice and long-lasting illness indicate trouble. If someone has been ill for a long time and is short of breath, it is a danger. A frail figure with a hoarse voice suggests chronic illness or tuberculosis, with lung ulcerations in the throat. Conversely, if someone remains loud despite being ill, it signifies fortune.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Second, listen to the distinction between clear and turbid sounds, and discern between true words and wild talk. Turbid sounds are like phlegm clogging, while clear sounds have their source in coldness within. Genuine speech is not merely hot, while wild words and shouting represent deep and firm heat. Speaking of deities and spirits transcends walls and roofs; a blockage in the chest shows signs of dizziness. Moreover, there are ailments that linger over time; a sudden loss of voice can lead to death.</p>
<p>[The five sounds correspond to the five organs: metal sounds are clear, earth sounds are turbid, wood sounds are long, water sounds are clear, and fire sounds are dry. A clear sound indicates smooth lung qi. A sound that comes from a room signifies dampness. If speech is faint and resumes only after a long day, it signifies a depletion of qi. A sound that is light then heavy, high-pitched and forceful is due to external influences. A sound that is heavy then light, sluggish and weak indicates internal injury.]</p>
<p>From the medical canon, discussions on sound:</p>
<p>Movement indicates a change in one’s usual state. With the slightest sound, differentiate the five organs and their changes, seeking the good and bad of diseases. While the principles are not without detail, the essence of governing one’s body lies significantly in qi and spirit. The classic states that when the center is ample and the organs are full, excessive qi leads to potentially harmful conditions; sound that seems to come from a room indicates internal dampness. The faintness of speech indicates qi emerging from the throat and tongue to the mouth. New patients and those with minor illnesses maintain their voice, but only those with prolonged or severe illnesses will see a change in their voice. Once the voice changes, the disease manifests and can no longer be evaded; it is thus something that can be heard and known. The classic says: to hear and know is called spirit.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

If one cultivates with sincere effort over time, it becomes as if a blind person hears with precision; could it not be said that the heart does not separate from the eyes? However, one must refer to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; to seek transformations of the heart, thus beginning to be called a divine ear. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; categorizes the five tones of Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, and Yu, as well as the five sounds of laughter, singing, crying, moaning, and groaning, to examine the internal and external states of the five organs and the evils of the five energies. It describes the liver&#39;s wood represented by the tone Jue and the sound call; its transformation is grip. The heart&#39;s fire represented by the tone Zhi and the sound laughter; its transformation is worry. The spleen&#39;s earth represented by the tone Gong and the sound songs; its transformation is eructation. The lung&#39;s metal represented by the tone Shang and the sound crying; its transformation is cough.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that when speech is evaluated as good or bad, without regard for familiarity or distance, this is a confusion of the divine and the bright. One can discern changes in spirit through sound, which is even more profound. The &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; also associates the sound of a patient&#39;s voice with their condition: if a patient speaks in a quiet and subdued manner, expressing delight or surprise, it indicates an ailment in the joints; if the voice is hoarse and unclear, it suggests a problem in the heart and diaphragm; if the voice is shrill, thin, and prolonged, it signifies an issue in the head. These three types of speech reflect illnesses in the lower, middle, and upper burners, each with its own discernible changes. The subtle meanings are revealed from heaven, easily understood even through a mere partition. A subdued voice indicates a desire to remain silent rather than to speak out. Quietude and concealment correspond to the three yin, which are connected to the jueyin (the terminal yin). How do we know this? Jueyin is associated with surprise in intention and with calling in sound; the illness is fundamentally silent yet includes moments of surprise and calling, thus we come to understand this.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When it comes to the Yin aspect, the illness must penetrate deeply into the lower regions, affecting the bones and the spaces between the sinews and joints. If sounds emit softly and are not fully expressed, it indicates a failure to resonate. When the great qi in the chest does not circulate, the mechanisms of inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling become difficult and delayed, indicating that the illness is within the middle jiao, between the chest and diaphragm. If the sounds are sharp and prolonged, they arise from the Yin division of the lower regions and ascend, correlated with the Taiyang channel governing qi and in connection with the Shaoyin, hence the kidney evil does not reach the neck but returns; it should progress through the Taiyang section to reach the summit. The sound of the kidneys is normally a groan, but now, as the kidney qi assaults directly upward along the Taiyang meridians, the groan transforms, becoming a sharp, prolonged sound, representing an illness in the head. This passage by Zhang Zhongjing expands the theory, emphasizing the importance of listening to sounds and discerning illnesses, so the writings cannot fully convey everything; scholars should seek out the endless treasures within themselves.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a></p></div>

<p>Discussion on Breath</p>
<p>Breath comes from the nose and its energy spreads in the zhong (anatomical center). The zhong qi governs the upper-jiao&#39;s respiratory pathway, constantly connected with the lungs and stomach. It may be clear and slow or short and rapid, all sufficient to gauge the fullness or deficiency of the zhong qi. Therefore, the classics say that the movements below the breast correspond to clothing, indicating that the zhong qi is leaking. Is it possible for a person to be recklessly anxious, causing the zhong qi to surge and result in rapid breathing, leading to excess and thus deficiency? This refers specifically to exhalation as one aspect of breath. When one&#39;s movements are normal, yet breath has sound, this indicates stagnation of the lung meridians; not being able to lie down but breath has sound indicates stagnation of the yangming. This further demonstrates that the spread of breath is connected to the lung and stomach, referring again to exhalation as one aspect of breath. Exhalation is governed by the heart and lungs, while inhalation is governed by the kidneys and liver. In the midst of respiration, the spleen and stomach govern. Thus, the spleen and stomach, governing the middle-jiao, are the primary support for respiration. If energy accumulates and blocks the entrance at the esophageal gate, preventing its flow, it results in a critical condition of life and death.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those skilled in nurturing life enable the qi of the upper gate to pass into the lower gate, and the qi of the lower gate to flow out through the two hidden passages, thus preventing harm. The upper and lower regions, each divided in breathing out and in, cannot be adequately described by merely the term &quot;breath.&quot; This understanding is known only to Zhongjing, who says that when breathing causes the shoulders to shake, the heart is firm; when breath draws the upper qi from the chest and leads to coughing, it is because the heart&#39;s fire causes the disturbance; when one breathes with an open mouth and shortness of breath, it suggests lung weakness and drool, indicating the division of breath dominated by exhalation, and not to be conflated with inhalation, which seems like an interpretation; yet, Zhongjing articulates this based on the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The analysis of expulsion being at both ends of inhalation is insufficiently comprehensive. Indeed, the heart fire dominates the lungs, leading to rapid and forceful exhalation, which must occur, as exhalation reflects the yang of the heart and lungs, not to be mixed with the yin of the liver and kidneys. When breathing causes the shoulders to move, it is merely the action of the fire. When breath draws the upper qi of the chest causing a cough, it results from the failure of the lung channels to descend, leading to a rebellious cough, again, due to the fire.<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one breathes short and shallow, with symptoms of lung atrophy, expectorating phlegm that resembles gold, and suffering under an incurable condition akin to being punished by fire, this is commonly referred to as &quot;breath.&quot; Why, then, do we not simply call it by that name? It is because breath involves both exhalation and inhalation, and that which is divided cannot be easily grasped by sages. The affliction of exhalation pertains to diseases of exhalation, while the affliction of inhalation pertains to diseases of inhalation, which need not be stated further. The classics mention the child suffering from wind-heat, wheezing, and shoulder breath. There are many such instances regarding the sound of breath, yet they are not spoken of together, as the diseases of inhalation are more readily identifiable. However, there is concern that future generations may not fully understand, so let me elaborate: when inhalation is slight, the disease resides in the middle burner, and can be remedied immediately; the weak cannot be treated. In the upper burner, inhalation is rapid; in the lower burner, inhalation is slow. All of these are difficult to treat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In observing the delicate and frequent inhalations, the swift movement of qi in and out of the middle jiao indicates that it must be substantial; by addressing this, one can clear the obstructions in the middle jiao and achieve recovery. If it is insubstantial, the foundational elements of the liver and kidneys are unstable, their qi is light and erratic, deviating from the yang, making treatment impossible. This is especially critical when the obstruction between the cardia and pylorus does not resolve, marking a dire situation for survival. </p>
<p>In the upper jiao, the inhalation is quick, as the pathways of the heart and lungs are close. In cases where true yin is deficient, the yang fire rises without entering the lower jiao, hence the rapid inhalation. Therefore, one must not overlook the inhalation in the upper jiao. In the lower jiao, the inhalation is slow, since the pathways of the liver and kidneys are distant. When the original yang is declining, it is trapped by yin pathogens, making it difficult to ascend, leading to slow inhalation. Both true yin and original yang are affected, hence they are hard to treat. </p>
<p>If the breathing is irregular and shaky, then the qi of the ying and wei is already engaged, with only a thin thread of breath remaining; is that still viable? One must first differentiate the inhalation and exhalation to understand the condition, and upon grasping the situation, corresponding treatment should be precise. However, when analyzing breathing, how then do we differentiate the roles of the upper, middle, and lower jiao? Alas, it is subtle! </p>
<p>In summary:<br>When differentiating breathing, failing to separate exhalation from inhalation to assess conditions, even by the smallest margin, is an error by the physician.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Listening to Voices</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: To hear and know is called being wise. Like distinguishing sounds, one can understand an object just by listening to its voice; even if it is not far removed, is it not truly profound? I will briefly mention the key points from the classics. The classics state: The liver, in sound, represents the &quot;horn&quot; and in voice represents &quot;call&quot;; the heart, in sound, represents &quot;sign&quot; and in voice represents &quot;laughter&quot;; the spleen, in sound, represents &quot;palace&quot; and in voice represents &quot;song&quot;; the lungs, in sound, represent &quot;market&quot; and in voice represent &quot;cry&quot;; the kidneys, in sound, represent &quot;feathers&quot; and in voice represent &quot;groan.&quot; When speech is chaotic, it is called nonsensical, this is the mix of both void and substance. When there are unfounded shouts, it is called wild words, this is the manifestation of substance. Speech that is bold and forceful, starting light and then heavy, indicates outer influences. Speech that is hesitant and cowardly, starting heavy and then light, indicates internal injury; when words do not connect, it is the Zheng sound; when no one initiates the conversation, it is solitary speech. These three types of evidence pertain to the void. Nasal obstruction with a heavy voice indicates a cold; hoarse voice with lip sores indicates possession; sudden silence in speech with retraction indicates a phlegm condition. Snoring with blocked speech indicates warm wind; confused speech and unsteady words indicate heat. A bubbling sound below the heart, starting with thirst and followed by vomiting, indicates blocked water. A gurgling sound in the throat indicates phlegm. If the intestines rumble like thunder, it indicates disharmony in the qi, related to dampness. In young children, convulsions with an inability to speak indicate heart heat. Complete silence is like a crow’s call, indicative of death. Various illnesses causing wheezing and a hoarse voice indicate severe conditions. If one can carefully observe these signs, they can indeed save lives. As for hearing the five voices to understand the suffering, this is the divine and wise method, existing solely in the heart of the one in charge of life.<br><strong>External Diagnosis Method [Question]</strong><a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Inner Canon</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Transformation of Essence and Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: I have heard the essentials from the Master; the Master said that one does not stray from color and pulse, and this is what I know. Qi Bo replied: The essence of treatment is in the unity. The Emperor asked: What is the meaning of unity? Qi Bo said: Unity is obtained through understanding. The Emperor inquired: How so? Qi Bo explained: Close the doors and seal the windows, and for the patient, repeatedly inquire about their condition to follow their intention. Those who gain spirit prosper, while those who lose spirit perish. The Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unity refers to spirit. When one obtains their spirit, all colors, pulses, essence, and qi are also obtained. To &#39;obtain&#39; means to derive from their feelings and intentions. Closing the doors and sealing the windows means to not let external thoughts intrude. Spirit resides in the heart; the movements of the heart and nature are termed feelings and intentions. Intention is what governs the spirit, gathers the soul, adapts to cold and warmth, and harmonizes joy and anger; hence, one should not let external thoughts distract, but frequently inquire into their feelings to follow their intention, thus grasping the existence or loss of their spirit. Those who lose spirit die, while those who gain spirit live.</p>
<p><strong>On the Three Parts and Nine Conditions</strong></p>
<p>It is imperative to carefully inquire about the initial ailment and the current ailments before taking each pulse to observe the floating or sinking of the meridians, and the reversal or following nature of the condition. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The initial ailment refers to an old and deep illness; the current ailment refers to the newly acquired, superficial ailment. Taking each pulse means to assess whether the affliction is in the yin or yang, in the organs or viscera. An old illness has a deep and reversed pulse, while a current ailment has a following and floating pulse; hence, one must observe the floating or sinking of the meridians, and the reversal or following nature.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the shape is joyful and the will is bitter, illness arises from the meridians, treated with moxibustion and acupuncture. [Note: This refers to a noble person. They may alternate between nobility and humility, understanding life and death, and deciding success and failure.]</p>
<p>When the shape is joyful and the will is joyful, illness arises from the flesh, treated with needles and stones.

<p>When the shape is bitter and the will is joyful, illness arises from the tendons, treated with pressing and guiding techniques. [Note: If one labors their shape, it harms the tendons; if the will is at ease and joyful, the blood vessels have not fallen ill. Therefore, it should be treated with pressing and guiding to nourish the tendons with blood vessels, leading to peace.]</p>
<p>When the shape is bitter and the will is bitter, illness arises in the throat and palate, treated with sweet medicine. [Note: Various worries affect the heart, and countless matters exhaust the body, harming both Yin and Yang, Qi, and blood. The throat governs the atmospheric Qi, while the palate governs the earthly Qi. Since both Yin and Yang Qi and blood are harmed, illness arises in the throat and palate, hence sweet medicine should be used to regulate the spleen and stomach.]</p>
<p>When the shape is frequently shocked and afraid, and the meridians are obstructed, illness arises from insensitivity, treated with massage and medicinal brews. [Note: Shock disrupts Qi, and fear causes it to descend.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Five Errors</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In cases where the illness has not yet been diagnosed, it is essential to inquire whether one has previously experienced wealth followed by poverty. Even if there is no malevolent influence, the disease arises from within, termed &quot;loss of nourishment.&quot; When one has experienced prosperity followed by misfortune, it is called &quot;loss of essence.&quot; The five vital energies become stagnant, and ailments may coalesce; when physicians diagnose without considering the organs or changing the body&#39;s condition, they may feel uncertain and fail to identify the disease. The body continues to weaken, energy is exhausted, and there is a lack of essence; the illness becomes profound, leading to sudden fears. In deeper illnesses, there is a depletion of external defenses and an internal loss of nourishment. When skilled doctors make mistakes, they do not grasp the severity of the condition. This is also one of the errors in treatment.</p>
<p>(Note: The phrases &quot;wealth followed by poverty&quot; and &quot;prosperity followed by misfortune&quot; refer to injuries to one’s morale; hence, even without malevolent influences, the disease arises from within. The spleen stores nourishment, which expresses intention, while the kidneys store essence, which expresses will; thus, when will and intention are lost, essence and nourishment are depleted. Stagnation of the five vital energies refers to the spirit energies of the five organs being congested internally and not being able to flow freely. &quot;Coalesce&quot; means illnesses merge with those of the five organs.)<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the five organs intersects with the skin, hair, muscles, and bones; thus the body diminishes daily. When energy is deficient and there is no essence, and when the illness is deep with no energy, it is said that energy arises from essence, and essence arises from energy. The joint deterioration of essence and energy occurs. When one is anxious and fearsome, it signifies a loss of long-term wealth and honors, thus one is startled by the time. This illness does not reside in the organs and bowels, nor in the body shape; essence and energy diminish daily, and the protective and nutritive systems are consumed daily. Even a skilled practitioner may not know the cause of this condition. This is the first mistake in treatment.</p>
<p>Whenever one desires to diagnose an illness, they must inquire about diet and living conditions. Sudden pleasure and sudden suffering, pleasure followed by suffering, all harm essence and energy. When essence and energy are exhausted, the body becomes ruined and depressed. Sudden anger harms Yin, and sudden joy harms Yang. When the vital energy rises, it fills the meridians and separates from the physical form. A foolish doctor who treats this, without understanding how to tonify or drain, not recognizing the condition, will see essence and energy gradually escape, allowing evil energy to invade. This is the second error in treatment.</p>
<p>Note: Taste pertains to form, and energy pertains to essence. Taste harms form, and energy harms essence. Heat harms energy, while cold harms form.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who enjoy life must have more than enough to eat and wear, while those who suffer must endure hunger and cold. Therefore, when diet is unregulated and temperature is inappropriate, it all harms vital essence. When vital essence is exhausted, the body will be destroyed. If joy and anger are not in balance, then yin and yang are not harmonized, leading to the rising of pathogenic qi, and the pulse becomes full and departs from its form. </p>
<p>The upper half of the body represents yang, and the lower half represents yin. The muscles and skin represent yang, while the channels and blood represent yin. When yin and yang are peaceful, the qi and blood circulate smoothly both internally and externally. If one experiences violent joy, it injures yang, causing qi to bind within yang and lead to counterflow. If one experiences violent anger, it injures yin, causing blood to bind within yin and lead to a fullness in the pulse. The blood and qi of the muscular form are therefore considered to be full when they are within the pulse. </p>
<p>Excesses should be drained away, while deficiencies should be replenished. A foolish physician treats without understanding replenishing and draining, and without understanding the condition of the disease, leading to daily loss of essence and the mingling of cold and heat pathogenic factors. This is the dual error in treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, it is important to detach from power; even if one is not affected by malice, the spirit can suffer internal injuries, leading to bodily ruin. If one starts wealthy and ends up poor, although it may not cause harm directly, the skin will become scorched, muscles will weaken, and there may be paralysis or cramping. If the doctor cannot be strict and cannot move the spirit, the exterior will become weak and chaotic, disrupting the normal state. If the illness cannot be displaced, then medical practices will not function. These are the four errors in treatment.</p>
<p>(Note: In times of power loss, it is essential to detach from it, for the concern arises internally, hence the spirit suffers. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: worry, fear, anger, and injury to the vital energy—these three cannot be preserved and thus lose their normal state. Starting wealthy and ending in poverty harms one&#39;s will and intention. Intention is what governs the spirit, gathers the soul, and adapts to cold and warmth, harmonizing joy and anger. Therefore, when the protective and nourishing energies are balanced, and will and intention are harmonious, the tendons and bones become strong, and the pores are dense. Thus, when the will and intention are harmed, the spirit cannot be internally guarded, leading to external afflictions of tendons and bones, unbalanced protective energies, and open pores, resulting in external weakness, and all three also lose their normal state.)<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a></p></div>

<p>Practitioners who do not understand that the energy entering the body has distinctions of yin and yang, nor the differences in blood and energy, are lacking in proper knowledge.

When death approaches, the doctor cannot see clearly; without inquiry into the cause, they merely speak of impending death—this too reflects a lack of skill.

<p>All these five instances arise from a misunderstanding of techniques and a lack of clarity in understanding human affairs. </p>
<p>Note: If one loses their wealth in a single day after having been prosperous, it greatly pains their spirit and soul. Thus, the heart governs the vessels, and the liver governs the tendons, as if severed; this represents harm to the left blood vessels.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the illness initially arises from the yin, over time it will affect the yang as well. Therefore, it injures and depletes the heart and liver blood, which then stagnates on the left side, resulting in a deficiency in the qi aspect that subsequently returns to the yang. Both the blood and qi on the left and right are harmed, leading to the accumulation of pus and cold heat. This occurs because the injury to yin causes it to weaken and return to the yang, hence the pus accumulates between the yin and yang, cold and heat. When both yin and yang, blood and qi are injured, supplementing the yang leads to the exhaustion of the yin, while draining the yin results in the loss of the yang. In such cases, one should only take sweet medicinals and should not resort to cauterization or needling. Inexperienced practitioners do not understand this and hastily puncture the yin and yang, leading to the disintegration of the body, which harms the spleen qi; if the limbs cramp, it signifies the exhaustion of the stomach qi. The spleen and stomach are the sources of life for the organs. Once the vital energy is exhausted, there is no chance for recovery. Even skilled physicians, if they are not aware of the interaction of yin and yang, and do not inquire into the cause of the illness, can only see the deterioration of yin and yang and the impending end; this too reflects a lack of understanding. They cannot discern the cause and appropriately administer treatment. All of these five factors arise within the five internal organs and are not due to external influences.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One must understand the qi of heaven and earth, the yin and yang, and the regularities of day-to-day affairs. Each has its own inherent principles; following them brings harmony and balance to one&#39;s intentions, while opposing them leads to harsh illnesses and violent outbreaks. This arises from a lack of mastery over the art and a failure to comprehend human affairs, culminating in five responsibilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said: When a sage treats illness, they must recognize the yin and yang of heaven and earth, the seasonal changes, the organs and viscera, and the interplay of male and female. Techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and the use of stones and poisons are all governed accordingly. One must approach human matters calmly to clarify the underlying principles. Status, wealth, and poverty all have their distinct qualities. Inquiry into youth and age, bravery and fear must also be pursued. By examining the differentiated pulse, one can identify the root of the illness. The eight principles and nine indicators must be diligently observed.</p>
<p>[Note: This summarizes the method of pulse diagnosis, which aligns externally with the yin and yang of heaven and earth, and the seasonal changes, while internally connecting with the organs and the male-female dynamics. Some methods may require moxibustion or acupuncture, while others may call for medicinal and dietary interventions. By addressing human affairs thoughtfully to clarify principles of status and wealth, and by understanding age and courage, one can discern the differentiated pulse and root cause of illness. Observing seasonal changes and the eight principles is crucial, and thus the diagnostic method is well-prepared and reliable.]<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Questions About Feelings and Intentions to Diagnose Illness</strong></p>
<p>When inquiring about illness, one must ask what the individual thinks, fears, desires, and doubts. The core inquiry focuses on discerning the true and false aspects of yin and yang, and identifying the cold and heat of the organs. Diseases arise from the balance of yin and yang, and the conditions of the organs; understanding this clearly ensures effective treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Questions About the Five Flavors to Determine the Origin of Illness</strong></p>
<p>The sixty-first difficulty states: to understand, one should ask about the desired five flavors to know the origin of the illness. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that each flavor affects certain aspects: sour targets the tendons and excessive consumption can cause urinary issues; salty affects the blood and can lead to thirst; spicy influences qi and too much can create heart problems; bitter affects the bones and can cause vomiting; sweet impacts the flesh and can lead to anxiety. With this reasoning, one can ascertain the illness&#39;s origin by asking about the desired five flavors. Moreover, if a person excessively craves certain flavors, it indicates an imbalance in organ energy.<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Cold Damage</strong> by Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Question: When to restrain sweating and purging based on the state of qi movement</strong></p>
<p>When the qi moves to the right, sweating should not be induced. If sweating is induced, it leads to thirst and restlessness, making one vomit water upon drinking. When the qi moves to the left, sweating should also not be induced. Inducing sweating causes dizziness and persistent sweating, along with muscle and tendon spasms. When the qi moves upward, sweating must not be induced. If sweating occurs, the qi rises and obstructions occur at the heart. When the qi moves downward, inducing sweating is inappropriate. Sweating leads to no perspiration, great restlessness within the heart, pain in the joints, a feeling of cold in the eyes, and vomiting food with difficulty in digestion. If there is obstruction in the throat, sweating should not be induced. If sweating happens, it can lead to vomiting blood, a feeling of impending collapse, coldness in the hands and feet, and an overwhelming desire to curl up without being able to get back to normal.</p>
<p>When the qi moves to the right, purging should not be done. If purging occurs, the fluids will be depleted and the throat will feel dry, the nose will be blocked, dizziness and palpitations may arise. When the qi moves to the left, purging should likewise be avoided. If purging occurs, there will be abdominal constriction, inability to eat, increased qi movement, and despite a fever, the urge to curl up while lying down. When the qi moves upward, purging is not advisable. If purging is performed, the hands and palms feel hot and irritable while the body feels cold, resulting in spontaneous sweating and a desire for water to quench the thirst. When the qi moves downward, purging must not be done. If purging occurs, there will be abdominal bloating, sudden dizziness, food will not stay down, and there may be a sense of fullness in the heart. If there is obstruction in the throat, purging should be avoided. Inducing purging leads to a feeling of lightness above and heaviness below, fluids cannot be swallowed, the urge to curl up while lying down persists, and there can be severe pain, with multiple episodes of diarrhea.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Treatment of Illness and Inquiry into Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: When there is heat in the middle, it causes coldness; when there is coldness in the middle, it produces heat. If there is heat in the stomach, it consumes food, leading to a restless heart and excessive hunger. If there is heat in the skin above the navel and heat in the intestines, it results in yellowish discharge resembling gruel. If there is coldness in the skin below the navel and coldness in the stomach, it causes abdominal bloating. When the intestines are cold, it leads to gurgling sounds and loose stools. This indicates that coldness in the intestines causes food to stagnate, resulting in gurgling and sharp pain, with stool appearing white. If the intestines are cold while the stomach is hot, it leads to intense hunger and pain in the lower abdomen. If both the intestines and stomach are hot, it results in bloating and diarrhea. It is not only heat in the intestines that causes diarrhea; coldness in the stomach, affecting digestion, can also lead to it. The stomach desires hot beverages, while the intestines need cold drinks. Despite differing preferences, in spring and summer one should first address the symptoms, while in autumn and winter, one should treat the root cause. Clothing should not be excessively cold or hot; one should not sweat from heat or feel despair from cold. Temperatures should be moderate, allowing the body to retain its balance and preventing the onset of ailments. Such guidelines are the standard practices, the principles of reason, and the measures of assessment. Treatment should be adapted to the situation, responding to changes as necessary.<a id="trans-242p" href="#orig-242p" class="marker">[242p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of external cold pathogens, along with illnesses caused by improper diet and labor that affect the physical constitution, and injuries from internal dietary issues, all exhibit signs of cold and heat. The entire world tends to misinterpret illnesses from internal dietary negligence and inadequate labor as those caused by external cold pathogens, thereby mistakenly treating superficial symptoms and resulting in an increase in casualties. This confusion primarily arises from an inability to distinguish between cold and heat.</p>
<p>Now, let us clarify this in detail: External cold pathogens cause fever and aversion to cold, with both cold and heat occurring simultaneously. The heat manifests as a vigorous fever, additionally producing a sensation that swells up and radiates outward, felt on the skin like the stroke of feathers, indicating that the heat is on the surface. This is a sign of external cold pathogens attacking the body&#39;s exterior. The skin and hair follicles represent the surface of Yang, nourished by the vital energy of defense. When cold pathogens invade, they obstruct the Yang aspect, preventing its expression, which in turn leads to fever.<a id="trans-243p" href="#orig-243p" class="marker">[243p]</a></p></div>

The surface shows only superficial heat. Despite heavy clothing and close proximity to a fierce fire, the chilling sensation cannot be resisted—the cold increases with each moment and day. One must wait for it to penetrate the interior before it subsides. The cold and heat arise simultaneously without interruption. </p>
<p>Internal injuries from irregular eating or excessive labor also cause headaches, neck stiffness, and lower back pain, which are somewhat similar to the superficial symptoms of the sun, yet differ significantly—this is clarified in the texts. Diseases caused by internal deficiencies occur when the exterior lacks yang, rendering it incapable of resisting wind and cold; this is common. The restless heat arising from the kidneys is different from the external cold evil. This is due to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, causing the vital qi to descend and disturb the kidneys and liver, leading to gradual weakness. However, if the stomach qi is normal, food enters the stomach, and the vital qi rises to nourish the heart and lungs, thereby sustaining the original qi of the skin and pores in the upper body.<a id="trans-244p" href="#orig-244p" class="marker">[244p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the body becomes deficient, the heart and lungs receive nothing, and the skin lacks yang. It loses the protection and warmth it needs, consequently becoming weak between the skin and hair. It becomes sensitive to wind and cold, especially in damp, shadowy places without sunlight, and reacts poorly to these conditions. This often occurs without interruption. However, by avoiding wind and cold, finding warmth, or adding clothing and covers to keep warm, the aversion to wind and cold can dissipate. This warmth arises not from external cold injury, but from heat generated within the skin and hair. It originates from dampness flowing downward from the spleen and stomach, blocking their pathways, which causes the yin fire to rise. This results in a steam-like internal heat that affects the head and spreads through the skin, causing the entire body to feel hot and restless. One must remain unclothed and in a cool place to relieve this condition. Alternatively, when heat becomes extreme and sweating occurs, this can provide relief. External injuries typically accompanied by chills and fever do not involve sweating. If one achieves sweating, then the illness is alleviated. Based on this distinction, is it not as clear as black and white? Those suffering from internal deficiency experience restlessness and heat.<a id="trans-245p" href="#orig-245p" class="marker">[245p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cause may stem from inhaling the cold air, which blocks the yin fire, causing obstruction in the throat and diaphragm. The inhaled air desires entry but is repelled by the fire of the ascending channel in the diaphragm, preventing the yin energy from entering. The qi within the chest is restrained by external cold winds and cannot expand, leading to a gaping mouth and bulging eyes. In extreme cases, sound escapes outward, and the qi is unable to rise or fall, becoming trapped in the throat and risking suffocation. </p>
<p>Additionally, it may occur due to hiccups, vomiting, or regurgitation, which stir up heat and restlessness, indicating an underlying cause for these symptoms. The signs of the exterior being weak and vulnerable to cold winds reappear. The weakness of the exterior is overpowered by the yin fire, causing transient restlessness. When the exterior is weak and lacks yang, it cannot withstand the reemergence of wind and cold. This weakness at the exterior is a constant issue, and the restlessness arises intermittently. When the restlessness presents, cold may emerge; conversely, when cold presents, restlessness may arise—this is different from the simultaneous onset of cold and heat due to external injury, which occurs without interruption.</p>
<p>All illnesses exhibit body heat, referred to as muscle heat or skin heat. It is only by palpation that one can discern this, as it pertains to the heat of the body&#39;s form. It is also necessary for yin and yang to be harmonized, for sweating to be the means of recovery. Care should be taken not to distinguish too finely in this matter! Because both internal and external conditions exist in a state of deficiency or excess, differentiating them is indeed difficult.

<p>External wind pathogens typically manifest as aversion to wind, sweating, headaches, and runny noses, often becoming stronger at different times throughout the day until they penetrate deeper, leading to internal symptoms.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Internal injuries are caused by irregular diet and exertion; however, they are also affected by wind. When one resides in a damp place and encounters a strong wind, it may not be harmful; yet, even a slight draft from the gaps of doors and windows can be quite detrimental. This differs from cold and flu symptoms. Additionally, there may be a runny nose and headaches accompanied by sweating. Breathing may feel short and insufficient; speech is also weak and breathless, leading to difficulties with eating or a lack of appetite, with these three symptoms interrelated.</p>
<p>Discomfort in the abdomen may occur, or there may be an urgent need that cannot be relieved. When the mouth forgets the taste of grains, urination is frequent without thirst. Initially, after exertion, one may fall ill, have a reduced appetite, and experience red or yellow urine. Bowel movements may be difficult, either dry or constipated, or one may feel weak and experience only small amounts of white pus, sometimes with abdominal distension. There can be yellow diarrhea that is watery or loose with a white hue, or constipation that does not relieve pressure, causing a sensation of fullness in the chest or pain akin to being stabbed, and these symptoms may not appear together.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the stomach or heart area may be painful, with pain in the upper body and flanks, reflecting a fiery disturbance below the navel that surges like an uncontrollable river, causing the Yangming channel to operate in reverse and disrupt the chest. This causes unrelenting gas and, in severe cases, leads to significant shortness of breath, heating the vital energy and resulting in limbs that cannot move, fatigue, and a desire to sleep. Because the external symptoms of wind and cold do not present this condition, it is easier to distinguish.<a id="trans-248p" href="#orig-248p" class="marker">[248p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing the Palm and Back of the Hand</strong></p>
<p>When internal injuries arise from overwork or irregular eating, the palm feels hot while the back of the hand remains cool. In cases of external injuries from wind and cold, the back of the hand feels hot while the palm does not. This distinction is very clear.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing the Mouth and Nose</strong></p>
<p>If injuries occur from eating, work, or excessive strain, the outer symptoms manifest prominently in the mouth, leading to loss of taste, abdominal discomfort, disinterest in speaking, and if compelled to respond, the voice will be weak and timid, with excessive salivation, and clear nasal discharge, which may fluctuate, indicating a yin condition. However, in the case of external injuries from wind and cold, the symptoms will prominently appear in the nose, causing blocked nasal passages, heavy and unclear voice, with speech being stifled but forceful, and the mouth will feel harmonious. In the case of cold damage, the face may turn red, the nose will be blocked and dry; in cases of wind damage, there will simply be a clear nasal discharge. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the nose is the indication of the lungs, and lung energy connects to the heavens. Therefore, when there is external injury from wind and cold, the nose will be affected. The mouth is associated with the earth, and spleen energy connects to the mouth; when eating is irregular or labor causes harm, the mouth loses the taste of grains and becomes indifferent to all flavors. It is also said that harm can occur from poor or harmful food. This is quite evident!<a id="trans-249p" href="#orig-249p" class="marker">[249p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiation of Headache</strong></p>
<p>Internal headaches sometimes occur and sometimes cease. External headaches are often present and must be transferred to treat the underlying condition. This highlights the difference between internal and external symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation of Middle Heat Similar Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>During extremely hot weather, headaches may arise from labor on the road, in the fields, or from physical weakness, insufficient food intake, and excessive labor. Additionally, those who frequently practice virtue and fasting may experience prolonged deficiency of stomach qi and develop heat due to overexertion. All these resemble the symptoms of middle heat treated with Bai Hu decoction. There must be notable heat upon physical examination, along with restlessness, confusion, intense thirst, and a desire to drink water. Due to excessive labor, there may also be body aches. At the onset of the illness, it specifically resembles excess heat obtained externally; wrongly administering Bai Hu decoction could be fatal within ten days. This condition signifies severe deficiency of the spleen and stomach, insufficient vital energy, and shortness of breath. After noon, as the yangming period approaches, the illness must reduce significantly. In cases of external middle heat, symptoms intensify by late afternoon, with increased thirst and persistent agitation. Those who do not overexert themselves will not exhibit these symptoms and may recover easily. If there is a difficult or ambiguous presentation, it is necessary to wait one or two days for medical treatment to avoid errors.<a id="trans-250p" href="#orig-250p" class="marker">[250p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Suitable and Forbidden Medicines for Internal Injuries from Diet</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In the case of internal injuries, the pulses at the qi and mouth are greater than those of the human pulse by one, two, or even three times; thus, one should use targeted medications. It also mentions: If there is a pulse in the upper part and none in the lower part, that person should vomit, and if they do not, they will die. However, if food is not accepted and there is a feeling of nausea, regardless of the magnitude of the pulse, it is not appropriate to use the standard remedy for nausea; instead, one should use a finger or an object to probe and induce vomiting. If what caused the injury does not come out completely, one must further diagnose the pulse and inquire about the source of injury, using food and medicine to eliminate it according to the nature of the blockage, which is also described as cold being treated by cold. If there is a discharge and it descends, it corresponds to the use of the Taiyin (Greater Yin). At this time, it is essential to include herbs that elevate and promote, allowing the vital energy to rise. A blockage is treated by removing blockages, and one acts to straighten that which is curved. What does it mean to be curved? It refers to injury to the stomach&#39;s qi. What does it mean to be straight? It indicates the promotion of stomach qi. Thus, treating internal injuries related to diet allows for the enhancement of life energy and the restoration of stomach qi; this embodies correcting the curved to make it straight.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one uses medicine according to the classification of injuries, the nature of the injured item—whether cold or hot, warm or cool, hard or soft—varies, making it difficult to establish a fixed method. One must adapt the treatment according to the specific injury, adjusting temporarily as needed. Additionally, it is important to inquire about the patient&#39;s constitution over time, as well as the nature of their injuries from cold or heat. If the patient enjoys eating and consumes food, then one should avoid using medicines that break the vital energy; if they eat out of hunger or distress, one should replenish the stomach’s energy. If compelled by others to eat, it may be necessary to reduce blood and enhance energy. </p>
<p>By examining the pulse, one can determine which organ is injured, thus allowing for appropriate medications for the illness. Is it wise to recklessly deplete the natural vital energy and risk losing the treasure of life? For example, if one first eats hot foods without injury, then follows with cold foods, and this results in undigested hot food causing harm, one should inquire about the quantities of the hot and cold foods consumed and adjust the medication accordingly. </p>
<p>If the injury is two parts from hot substances and one part from cold, then one should use two parts of cold medicine and one part of hot medicine combined to restore the vital energy. There are also instances where one drinks alcohol before consuming cold foods, or injures themselves with hot foods, cool water, or ice—each scenario must be considered. One should inquire about the items that caused the injury, measure the ratios of cold and hot medicines accordingly, and tailor the treatment to the specific condition without fail.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>About Daily Life</strong>  </p>
<p>In treating illness, one must first inquire about daily living, diet, and habits.  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Fundamental Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>Every illness has a root, much like grass has roots. Removing the leaves without addressing the roots will leave the grass still standing. Treating illness without addressing its root is akin to removing plants without addressing their roots; if the illness is within the organs yet we treat the exterior, not only do we harm the stomach&#39;s vital energy, but we also aid the pathogenic factors—what does the physician say to this? My elder relative is seventy years old, robust in spirit yet thin in body. At the end of summer, he suffered from diarrhea, and by late autumn, various treatments were ineffective. Upon examination, I noted that although his illness had lasted long, his spirit remained undiminished, his urination scant and not dark, the pulses in both hands were thin yet somewhat taut. He mentioned feeling a slight oppression in the diaphragm and reduced appetite. I then realized this must be years of accumulated phlegm, lurking in the stomach and intestines. I asked him what he enjoyed eating throughout his life. He replied that he had never missed a day of eating carp for three years. I diagnosed that there was phlegm accumulating in the lungs. The lungs are connected to the large intestine, so the foundation of the large intestine must be unstable. It was necessary to clarify the source of this accumulation for it to clear on its own. I prescribed a strong decoction made with evodia, dried tangerine peel, green onion, radish root, and ginger, sweetened with sugar, instructing him to drink about one bowl. By probing with his finger, after half an hour, he expelled about half a liter of thick phlegm. That night, it reduced by half. The next morning he drank again and expelled another half liter, stopping the diarrhea. I then prescribed Pingwei powder, adding Atractylodes and Coptis, and within ten days, he was at ease.<a id="trans-254p" href="#orig-254p" class="marker">[254p]</a></p></div>

I said: &quot;There is stagnant blood at the entrance of the stomach, and the qi is obstructed, turning into phlegm; this must be caused by the food. Speak clearly to me.&quot; He was not aware of it himself. I then asked: &quot;What do you often eat during the winter?&quot; He replied: &quot;Every day, I must drink a couple of cups of strong liquor early to dispel cold.&quot; I prescribed a remedy: half a silver cup of leek juice, to be drunk cold in small sips, until half a pound of leek juice is consumed, and the illness was relieved.

I checked his pulse; both hands were dry, with the right slightly taut as well. I said: &quot;This is a severe case of gonorrheal sores; take Danggui Longhui Pills without musk.

<p><strong>Inquiry About Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>First, ask: Is there pain in the head and body? Observe if there are continuous chills and fever due to external factors. If the palms are hot and the mouth is indifferent to taste, it indicates harm from food and weariness. There might be restlessness with heat in the five hearts and a cough; if someone is thin, it points to a deficiency of yin and excessive heat. Besides these three noted conditions, if there are mixed symptoms like malaria or dysentery, they must be recognized. From head to toe, questions must be detailed and symptoms carefully listened to. </p>
<p><strong>Does the head hurt?</strong> Continuous pain indicates an external injury, while intermittent pain suggests internal harm.<br><strong>Are the eyes red and swollen?</strong> They may be suddenly red and swollen, or persistent pain might be present.<br><strong>Is there ringing or deafness in the ears?</strong> It could be in one ear or the other. For those who have been deaf for a long time, one should be cautious about using only tonifying medicines and should also prescribe remedies to promote qi.<br><strong>Is there nasal discharge?</strong> It could be dry without mucus, blocked, consistently running, or even nosebleeds or alcohol-induced redness.<br><strong>Can you taste food?</strong> If they do not eat, but can recognize taste, it points to an external attack of wind and cold; if they eat and still cannot taste, it indicates internal harm from diet.<br><strong>Are you thirsty?</strong> Drinking cold water suggests thirst from heat, while drinking hot water indicates deficiency; excessive thirst in summer leading to frequent drinking suggests heat from summer.<br><strong>Is there a coating on the tongue?</strong> It could be white, yellow, black, or red and cracked.<br><strong>Are there toothaches?</strong> It may be in the upper or lower gums, or from a tooth itself.<br><strong>Is there stiffness in the neck?</strong> Sudden stiffness suggests wind and cold; prolonged stiffness indicates phlegm and heat.<br><strong>Is there a sore throat?</strong> Sudden pain often points to phlegm-heat, whereas chronic pain relates to deficiency below.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a></p></div>

If both the back and palm are hot, it signifies a combination of internal injury and external factors. Are the tips of your fingers cold? Coldness suggests a chill; if not cold, it might indicate wind injury, while a naturally cold sensation indicates bodily weakness. Is there paralysis in the limbs? When the left hand or foot, or arm cannot raise or is painful, it relates to blood deficiency with fire. If the right hand or foot, or arm is affected, it pertains to energy deficiency with phlegm. Is there pain in the shoulders and back? Sudden pain is due to external factors, while chronic pain indicates deficiency and stagnation. Is there pain in the lower back or spine? Sudden pain is also due to external factors, while chronic pain signifies kidney deficiency with stagnation. Is there pain in the coccyx? Sudden illness suggests an invasion of the Taiyang channel, while chronic pain indicates fire in the Taiyang channel. Is there fullness in the chest? If there is fullness below, it is due to a mass in the chest; if not, it suggests an evil entering the Shaoyang channel, rather than a mass in the chest.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essential Reading for Physicians</strong><br><strong>Li Zhongzi, Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Not Losing Human Feelings</strong></p>
<p>I have often read the Inner Canon and reached the section on the fluctuations of conditions, which concludes with the phrase: &quot;Not losing human feelings.&quot; It never fails to make me sit up, sighing deeply at how profoundly it enters the human heart! The concept of not losing human feelings is something that physicians urgently need to grasp, yet it is exceedingly difficult. Generally, there are three types of human feelings: first, the feelings of the patient; second, the feelings of others; third, the feelings of the physician. </p>
<p>The feelings of the patient refer to how each organ has its own tendencies, and how the seven emotions have their own dominances. The yang organs should be treated with coolness, while the yin organs should be treated with warmth. For those who can endure toxins, a gentle remedy may be ineffective, while for those who are sensitive to toxins, a harsh remedy can cause harm. This illustrates the different energies of the organs. </p>
<p>Motion and stillness each have their own preferences and aversions, while food and drink are also liked or disliked. Those with a tendency toward auspiciousness may find unfavorable words hard to accept; those who are overly worried may be deceived by false reassurances. For those who do not believe, earnest advice is hard to enact; for the overly suspicious, profound words are met with suspicion. This reflects the differences in likes and dislikes. Wealthy individuals tend to indulge their desires and disregard restrictions; those in high positions often self-important and arrogant, disregarding reason. This highlights the differences in interpersonal interactions.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The poor lack adequate clothing and food, let alone medicine; the distressed toil excessively and suffer, revealing their inner turmoil. This reflects the differences in treatment. There are wise words that, when initially trusted, may turn into false views; many paths lead to straying, leading to unfulfilled hopes. This is the danger of having no guidance. Some are overly fearful of the extraordinary and only seek concealed truths; a little firewood and a cup of water cannot prevent their demise—this is the danger of excessive caution. Some find external circumstances do not align, failing to achieve their goals, experiencing deep affection and attachment that good medicine cannot remedy—this illustrates the harm of gains and losses. Those with acute conditions suffer delayed healing from additional treatments; those with chronic conditions facing sudden illness may become stagnant and difficult to reverse. This shows the harm of recognizing urgency and delay. Some taste medicines with hesitation, fearing that ceasing to take them will cause blockage; some fear that strong medicines will cause them to lose their spirit, demonstrating the perils of mental state. There are those who hide their ailments and conceal their feelings, even pretending to mask symptoms, attempting to diagnose through pulse alone, unaware that throughout history, no wise person ever relied solely on this method without questioning or observing. For instance, if the pulse at the qi point is strong, it indicates harm from food. Can one really discern the precise day of injury or the nature of what was harmed solely from the pulse? These are insights about the patients’ conditions that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Detailed Inquiry into Illness</strong></p>
<p>In diagnosing an illness, one must first ask about the person being examined: whether they are male or female, old or young, a servant or a maid. Next, inquire about the onset of the illness, its causes, the state of appetite and digestive energy, the nature of bowel movements, any medications previously taken, and the patient&#39;s condition during the day and at night, including any sensations of fullness, pressure, or pain in the chest area. </p>
<p>If the patient answers without clarity, it may indicate deafness; one should then ask whether they have been hard of hearing for long. Otherwise, if the illness has persisted for too long or if excessive sweating has occurred, it may lead to temporary deafness. A patient who is reluctant to speak or merely nods indicates a deficiency of vital energy.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Confused and unaware of one&#39;s condition, is it due to a violent seizure? Or from a prolonged illness? Women often have phlegm. </p>
<p>A woman should inquire about the condition of the lunar water. A widow’s vital energy and blood become stagnant, feeling like more than two feet of accumulation, which should not be mistakenly diagnosed as a fetus. The same applies to unmarried women. If there is swelling and pain in the abdomen, it is essential to ask whether it is a previous illness or something newly arisen. </p>
<p>In diagnosing an illness, one must ask what flavors are desired and what things are favored, whether it be indulging in wine or practicing vegetarianism. A liking for sour indicates liver deficiency, whereas a fondness for sweet indicates spleen weakness. Head, body, and arm pain should always inquire if there have been previous sores.</p>
<p>Wang Haizang said: When a common person seeks diagnosis, they remain silent, allowing only pulse diagnosis to determine their illness. The pulse reflects a person’s vital energy and blood through the meridians; if heat predominates, the pulse is rapid, if cold prevails, the pulse is slow. A strong pulse indicates fullness, while a weak pulse indicates deficiency. As for the cause of the illness and what was injured, can it truly be known through the pulse? Therefore, a physician must not neglect to ask for the cause, and the patient must not fail to explain their reasons. </p>
<p>Zhongnian Sun stated: It is most reliable to ask before diagnosis. Su Dongpo remarked: The difficulty of understanding the pulse is an issue both ancient and modern. In cases of deficiency, there might be an excess condition; in cases of true fullness, there can appear signs of emaciation. Between doubt and certainty lies the difference between life and death. Scholars often keep their ailments secret to test a physician’s ability. Throughout my life, when seeking treatment for ailments, I always fully disclose my conditions. This enables the physician to clearly know where the illness lies, distinguishing between deficiency and fullness, cold and heat, establishing understanding in their mind first, then proceeding to pulse diagnosis, lest doubt mislead their judgment.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I seek only to recover from illness; how can I burden the physician? In obstetrics, first inquire about the ease of sitting on the grass, the amount of lochia, the timing of meals, and the survival of the child. There are differences between injuries to the form and injuries to the blood, thus the need to supplement qi and blood differs. Eating and drinking should be regular; if the child does not survive, one must also open the stagnation. Ask about desires to understand the illness. If one craves heat, it indicates cold; if one desires cold, it indicates heat. If one prefers stillness and dislikes movement, it indicates deficiency; if one is restless, it indicates excess. Aversion to food indicates food injury, and aversion to wind indicates wind injury. Craving sweet food suggests spleen deficiency, craving spicy food suggests lung disease, craving sour food suggests liver deficiency, craving salty food suggests kidney weakness, and an appetite for bitter food suggests heart disease. These conditions are in harmony and easy to treat. However, if someone with heart disease craves salty food, someone with lung damage desires bitter, someone with spleen weakness enjoys sour, someone with liver disease prefers spicy, and someone with kidney decline craves sweet, these are contrary signs. Light illnesses may become serious, and serious cases lead to death. If treated with the correct method and medications are taken for prevention, revival is still possible. </p>
<p>For example, when Tang Ruzheng treated a child suffering from wind-heat, the child fully healed except for the crown of the head. Inquiring into the cause, he learned that the wet nurse enjoyed hot wine, which he recognized as toxic.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Laws</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry into Illness</strong></p>
<p>Medicine is an art rooted in compassion. A benevolent person must be deeply attuned to emotions; when they are, they see others as themselves, inquiring about their suffering without omission. In ancient times, practitioners would close doors and cover windows, asking patients about their conditions repeatedly to understand their intentions. If one can genuinely please the patient, the inquiries will not feel burdensome to the questioner, nor will they be unwelcome to the patient. This allows for thorough investigation and accurate treatment. </p>
<p>An imbalance can arise when the rich become poor—their ailments may be miscategorized. Similarly, when one is affluent but loses vitality, their condition might be misdiagnosed. Additionally, physical and mental states of joy and sorrow can result in similar ailments that require different treatments; disruptions in diet and daily routines during seasons and festivals; afflictions of worry and fear that agitate the spirit; personal preferences and aversions that create distinct dispositions; and varying individual temperaments regarding what is suitable or harmful. </p>
<p>Without inquiry, how can one tailor treatment appropriately? Therefore, one should learn the customs of a country, understand the taboos of a family, ask the appropriate questions in a formal setting, and inquire about what the patient finds comfortable. The comfortable aspects include their living conditions, movements, responses to heat and cold, and the suitability of their emotional state. For instance, if a patient’s illness is identified as heat, one can employ cooling methods; if identified as cold, warming methods can be used. This approach aligns treatments with the patient’s condition. </p>
<p>Many are rigid in their own opinions; opposing their views may offend, while accommodating them may exacerbate their illness. There is no better way than this.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a></p></div>

If a person has a chronic illness even before they fall ill, and if they become seriously unwell and acquire new ailments, if one does not inquire and rigidly adheres to established treatments, will this not harm the patient? In cases of difficult diagnoses, if one is determined to ask but cannot uncover the truth, and hears irrelevant comments that could turn real, if one does not ask in detail and hastily makes a blind decision, will this not harm the patient? The section on symptoms states: ask about the illness to know its nature, which is termed skillful. Today, those called skillful often inquire about what is not to be asked, flattering amidst it. The patient, delighted, follows this, and as the illness worsens, the medical response remains the same, leading to indecision regarding treatment. When one unexpectedly meets a knowledgeable person, they still refrain from taking action. This calls for careful guidance, as if addressing a sovereign or parent; one cannot be nonchalant or external in such matters. Even more astonishing are ignorant friends and relatives who inquire, forgetting their own ignorance, vainly flaunting their knowledge, speaking falsely and asserting truths, pointing to fire while labeling it phlegm. Who can say they are blameless while making easy statements? They sit idly, conforming and catering, creating shallow currents without any resolution; this is truly lamentable! We must be clear in self-discipline, sincere in motivating others, and together withstand the turbulent waves!<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a></p></div>

Those who are troubled become stagnant and inactive, those filled with fear become anxious and lose their guard, those in great anger become confused and unhealed, and those who are excessively joyful become careless and cannot contain themselves.

<p>Inquiry and Diagnosis</p>
<p>In diagnosing illnesses, there is no method more exquisite than taking the pulse. However, some diseases correspond with the pulse, while others do not; within this lies profound principles. Therefore, when facing ambiguous and difficult cases, it is essential to employ the four diagnostic methods, thoroughly inquire into the origins of the illness, and discern the patient&#39;s voice and complexion. It is crucial to correct the order of primary and secondary issues with reason, thus attaining the truth. If one neglects this and only relies on a single diagnosis, carelessly treating at random, how can one grasp the numerous truths and falsehoods of the pulse? When discrepancies arise, how can one avoid mistakes? Moreover, those who frequently diagnose find it easier, while novices face significant challenges. This is why the four diagnostic methods should never be overlooked. Therefore, the &quot;Nanjing&quot; places pulse-taking at the end of the four diagnostics, which serves a profound purpose. Tao Jie&#39;an also states: &quot;Inquire about the illness to understand its external aspects, observe the pulse to grasp its internal condition; it all hinges on the key concepts of being dynamic, which is the essence of pulse-taking during clinical practice.&quot; This principle is explained most thoroughly by Wang Shishan.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inquiry about Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about cold and heat pertains to the internal and external states of cold and heat, aiming to distinguish whether they are present superficially or internally. When a person suffers from cold, the illness manifests as heat. Therefore, any condition where the body shows signs of heat, with tight pulses, headache, body aches, and rigidity without sweating, especially if it arises suddenly, can be attributed to external pathogens. This is because the cold evil is in the meridians, causing headaches and bodily pains; the pathogen obstructs the skin and muscles, leading to rigidity and fever. If one does not have a chronic illness but suddenly exhibits these symptoms, it is often due to external influences. Since the cold evil is not something chronic but appears suddenly, this is a superficial condition. If there are no superficial symptoms but the body’s heat persists without abatement, it is more likely indicative of internal injury. However, there must be corresponding internal signs that align together to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>In general, if body heat continues for ten days or even over a month, it may still correspond to superficial conditions. This is often because of an initial exposure to cold evil, leading to body heat and headaches. If a physician cannot discern the condition and mistakenly diagnoses it as heat, treating it with cold remedies can prevent the pathogen from dispersing, or even if it is eventually treated, if the medication does not reach the ailment, it can lead to retention in the meridians, with a prevalence of external symptoms and fewer internal signs. This does not signify an internal issue; it still requires dispersing treatment.</p>
<p>For internal conditions that cause fever, they are mostly related to Yin deficiency or due to accumulated heat. Nonetheless, there must be corresponding internal signs, and the development of these conditions is gradual. It is understood that Yin deficiency must harm the essence, and harm to the essence must involve the organs.<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a></p></div>

<p>All forms of anger and emotional disturbances harm the liver and organs causing heat, which are collectively due to insufficiency of true yin, hence the evil fire easily ignites, indicating yin deficiency as well.</p>
<p>Any fatigue harming the spleen resulting in fever is due to insufficiency of spleen yin, making it prone to injury. When injured, heat arises in the muscles, again suggesting yin deficiency.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about sweating also serves to observe the exterior and interior. Generally, when exterior pathogenic factors are vigorous, there will be no sweating. When one is sweating, it indicates that the pathogenic factor is being expelled along with the sweat, implying the absence of exterior pathogenic factors; this is a natural principle. Thus, when the pathogenic factor has diminished completely and sweating occurs, the body cools and heat recedes, indicating the departure of the pathogenic factor. If the pathogenic factor remains in the meridians while sweating occurs only on the skin, this is not genuine sweating. After sweating, if the pathogenic factor has slightly reduced but not completely eliminated, residual pathogenic factors still exist; therefore, one should not hastily conclude that there are no exterior pathogenic factors based solely on sweating, but must carefully examine the pulse and symptoms.</p>
<p>In instances of warmth, summer heat, and similar conditions, there are cases where sweating is caused by pathogenic factors, while others may sweat without dispelling the pathogenic factor—both are exterior symptoms. In summary, if the exterior pathogenic factors have not been eliminated, they will affect the channels externally, leading to possible pain in the head and body; if they affect the internal organs, this may cause restlessness or anxiety in the chest and diaphragm. In both exterior and interior cases, there are symptoms to rely on; whether the pulse is tight or rapid can provide diagnostic differentiation. One must discern the authenticity, vacuity, and solidity of conditions, identifying what is slight and what is severe in order to treat accordingly.</p>
<p>If there are symptoms that are entirely unrelated to exterior factors, there may be cases of yang deficiency causing sweating, which requires tonifying the qi; for yin deficiency causing sweating, one should nourish the essence; if there is excessive fire causing sweating, one should cool it for self-recovery; if excessive drinking leads to sweating, clearing it may bring tranquility. It is crucial to investigate the yin-yang and exterior-interior aspects of sweating symptoms.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inquiry about Head and Body</strong></p>
<p>To inquire about the head allows one to assess the upper and lower aspects. To inquire about the body allows one to perceive the exterior and interior. Headaches indicate that pathogens reside in the Yang regions, while body pains suggest pathogens exist within the meridians. One can discern yin and yang through the front, back, left, and right; the presence or absence of heat reveals internal and external conditions. If it is purely an exterior pathogen, dispersing it will lead to recovery.</p>
<p>In cases where excessive internal heat causes headaches, there must be an internal correlate, possibly located in the throat or ears, discernible by the absence of body heat or aversion to cold. Here, the heat is excessive in the upper part, with the disease being internal. One should examine which meridian is affected, and it is appropriate to clear and reduce it. High heat should be suppressed; this is the principle. If one uses a light, uplifting dispersal remedy, the fire will only rise further, worsening the pain.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by yin deficiency, they can arise unpredictably due to excessive indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures, or due to overwork, or emotional disturbances, leading to exacerbated symptoms. This is an internal condition related to essence or qi and requires tonification.</p>
<p>Most headaches attributed to internal factors stem from heat, which is commonly observed. However, there are cases where cold yin is present above, and yang deficiency fails to lift, resulting in intense pain. Symptoms may include aversion to cold and vomiting, and the pulses may be weak or thin. When treatments prove ineffective, remedies such as cinnamon, aconite, ginseng, and similar warming herbs may lead to recovery. This indicates a headache associated with yang deficiency.</p>
<p>The term &quot;head wind&quot; is an informal catch-all in popular usage; however, it must have a basis and requires investigation of its root cause to discern the appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-278p" href="#orig-278p" class="marker">[278p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of dizziness or heaviness of the head, one can distinguish between reality and illusion based on these symptoms. Usually, dizziness in the context of illness arises because the clear Yang does not ascend, leading to an upper deficiency. As Danxi mentioned: &quot;Without phlegm, there is no dizziness,&quot; which is not a truly accurate statement. It is necessary to consider the physical condition and differentiate between temporary and prolonged symptoms. According to the Inner Canon, when the upper is deficient, there is dizziness; when the upper is excessive, there is heat and pain, and the meaning is clear. Heaviness of the head particularly corresponds to an upper deficiency. The classic states: &quot;When the upper qi is insufficient, the brain is not filled, and the head suffers from tilting.&quot; This is what is meant. </p>
<p>As for severe body pain, one should also examine both the exterior and interior to differentiate between cold and heat. If the pain arises from an invasion of cold, it can occur in the upper or lower body, with no fixed location, and it dissipates by itself; this is an exterior pathogen. If the pain is localized and there are no other exterior symptoms, it belongs to the category of painful obstruction; despite the pathogenic qi residing in the channels, it should be confirmed through interior symptoms, distinguishing only between cold and heat. In cases of excessive fire, there may be skin burning, persistent redness and swelling, or internal thirst; there must be corresponding heat symptoms, and treatment should focus on clearing and cooling. If there are no heat indicators but the pain persists, it is often due to yin cold, which causes blood and qi stagnation. The classic states: &quot;Pain is caused by excess cold; therefore, to alleviate the pain, one must warm the channels to promote the flow of blood and qi, allowing the pathogens to exit on their own.&quot; </p>
<p>In cases of significant strain and sudden severe body pain, this indicates extreme yin deficiency that fails to nourish the tendons and bones, leading to a state of depletion. The nutritive qi is exhausted and thus ineffective.<a id="trans-279p" href="#orig-279p" class="marker">[279p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inquiry on the Two Excretions</strong></p>
<p>The two excretions serve as the gateways of the body. Regardless of internal injury or external influences, one must observe these to distinguish between cold and heat, deficiency and excess. The preceding yin connects to the bladder, allowing one to discern its beneficial or detrimental effects, heat or lack of heat, and the strength or weakness of the body&#39;s Qi. In cases of cold damage, if urination is easy and plentiful, this indicates that the influence of the Tai Yang (Greater Yang) is not severe, which is a favorable sign. The latter yin opens the gate of the large intestine, allowing one to observe its passage or blockage, and whether there is accumulation or not, in order to gauge the deficiency or excess of the Yang Ming (Lesser Brightness). If there is feverish constipation and a hard, full abdomen, this indicates excess, and one can take measures to alleviate it. However, if recent defecation was obtained but the stool is not too dry, or if one has not defecated for ten days yet feels no bloating, then this does not indicate true Yang Ming excess. According to Zhongjing: if the stool is hard at first and then becomes liquid, it should not be purged. This shows that, although there was initial hardness, later looseness does not indicate true heat. Furthermore, if there are continuous loose stools for several days, that too can be understood. If there are no true signs of hardness, dryness, or fullness, then it is evident that there is no true excess to be attacked. Generally, if urination is merely yellow, one may think it a sign of fire, not realizing that when a person is fatigued, urination can also appear yellow. Persistent worry and overthinking can also lead to yellow urine, as can chronic diarrhea. Drinking alcohol excessively can harm the yin, resulting in yellow urine as well.<a id="trans-280p" href="#orig-280p" class="marker">[280p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is no true heat or pain, and the conditions of heat are accompanied, one cannot assume that yellow urine indicates fire. I have seen many who, due to the forcing out of vital fluids, have met their demise. The classics say: when the central qi is insufficient, urination and bowel movements will change, which is clear in meaning. If the urine is clear and beneficial, it indicates that the internal pathogenic influence is not severe, and the illness is not in the qi aspect. When the body’s fluids are transformed by qi, if the illness is qi-related, urination will not be beneficial. If urination gradually becomes beneficial, it indicates that the transformation of qi is evident, which is a good sign. </p>
<p>The large intestine is the sea for the processing of food and drink, the gateway of the stomach and intestines. The bladder is the sea for blood and qi, the passageway of the chong and ren channels. Both urination and defecation are governed by the kidneys, which are essential for original qi. One must truly observe the actual pathogenic influences before discussing matters of regulation and expulsion. Otherwise, it is best to observe carefully and prudently, to avoid misguided action. If one pursues what is not real, causing the loss of original qi, those superficial pathogenic influences may take advantage of the resulting emptiness and delve deeper. Consequently, internal struggles will inevitably lead to further depletion through purging. Therefore, in cases of insufficient illness, one should not force expulsion. The ideal situation is when urination benefits by obtaining qi and transforms by itself, while bowel movements being solid indicates improved health. When both ying and wei (nutritive and defensive qi) are balanced, there will naturally be passage. Even if the large intestine is blocked for ten days or more, there should be no concern. If one experiences loose stools without control, this should not be the case for those who are truly weak; preventing this should be the priority.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inquiry on Diet</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about one’s diet serves two purposes: first, it allows us to observe the clarity or turbidity of the appetite; second, it helps us assess the yin and yang of the organs. When illness arises from external factors yet the appetite remains, it indicates that the pathogen has not affected the organs, and we can understand whether the food is agreeable or not. If the illness is due to internal injury and the eating habits change, we can discern one&#39;s preferences for flavors, indicating a liking for cold or heat. Those who desire warmth know the yin organs require warmth; those who prefer cold understand that the yang organs benefit from being cleared. Sometimes, disturbances in eating and drinking can lead to inadvertent harm, and changes in diet can provide clues for diagnosis. Hence, the nature of one’s diet should be carefully examined, and the appropriateness of medicinal foods can be inferred from it. Generally, if a patient feels slightly reassured by food, it indicates a deficiency syndrome. If the appetite grows stronger, it could indicate either deficiency or excess, which must be distinguished and treated accordingly.<a id="trans-282p" href="#orig-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inquiries Regarding the Chest</strong></p>
<p>The chest, or the central part of the thorax, connects above to the heart and lungs and below to the organs of digestion. There are numerous diseases of the chest and abdomen, making it difficult to enumerate them all. However, when diagnosing a patient, one must inquire in order to discern whether there is an evil presence and whether to replenish or drain. Generally, if there is distension and fullness in the chest and abdomen, one should avoid using tonics; if there is neither distension nor fullness, one should avoid purgatives. This is a fundamental principle. However, &quot;pí&quot; (a specific feeling of discomfort) and fullness are different and should be distinguished by their severity. </p>
<p>In severe cases, there is a sensation of distension that feels like fullness, indicating a true evil, and one must use purgative methods. In mild cases, there is simply a lack of appetite, an inability to discern hunger and fullness, a sensation that resembles distension but is not true distension; rather, it is &quot;pí&quot; qi, or stagnant energy, which is not actual fullness. This may arise from either an evil force invading the chest or from the spleen being weak and failing to move properly. The patient may not understand this distinction and may simply feel that their stomach qi is not activated, resulting in a lack of food intake, stating they feel a sense of fullness and discomfort, when in fact, there is no true distension or fullness.<a id="trans-283p" href="#orig-283p" class="marker">[283p]</a></p></div>

If one does not discern the truth, they may inevitably misapply tonics or purgatives, leading to considerable harm. Nowadays, many people suffer from deficiencies, so supplementation is necessary. However, the methods of supplementation should not be rushed. To determine whether it is appropriate to supplement or not, one must first assess the condition of the chest and abdomen, and then proceed gradually. If the illness has not advanced, one can use stronger measures without concern. This is the significant principle of supplementation.</p>
<p>In cases of deficiency that are urgent, tonic agents cannot afford to be administered slowly. It is essential to first inquire about the state of the chest; only then can one advance the treatment swiftly. If the vital energy is truly deficient and the chest and abdomen are bloated, this indicates a true deficiency that cannot accept supplementation. If one forcefully administers tonics, it will not only be ineffectual but is likely to invite criticism.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Inquiry on Deafness</h3>
<p>Although the ear is associated with the lesser yang channel, it is essentially the organ of the kidneys and the gathering point of the ancestral vessels. Inquiry into it not only allows for discernment between deficiency and excess, but also reveals matters of life and death. For those who have been deaf for a long time, the closure of this channel is not surprising. However, for those who become deaf due to illness, it is crucial to make a distinction. As mentioned in the Treatise on Heat Disorders: &quot;After three days of cold damage, the lesser yang suffers, resulting in deafness.&quot; This occurs because cold pathogens obstruct the channel and obstruct the qi. Nevertheless, through my observations, there has been no case that did not arise from qi deficiency.</p>
<p>The Suwen states: &quot;When essence is depleted, deafness ensues.&quot; Zhang Zhongjing noted: &quot;In cases of deafness with no hearing, it is due to yang qi deficiency.&quot; From this perspective, of all diseases, those that are due to qi deficiency account for nine out of ten, while those resulting from qi obstruction comprise one out of ten. </p>
<p>Deafness can vary in severity; mild cases correspond to less severe illness, while severe cases indicate more serious conditions. If treatment leads to gradual alleviation, one can observe the gradual recovery of the illness; if it progresses, the disease also advances. If the condition reaches an extreme state of deafness, such that there is complete loss of hearing, this indeed corresponds to the depletion of essence; I have encountered several such cases, all of which were beyond treatment.<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inquiring About Thirst</strong></p>
<p>Inquiring about thirst or lack of thirst allows one to discern the internal conditions of cold and heat, and the differences between deficiency and excess can also be observed. When there is significant internal heat, there will be great thirst. This is characterized by a preference for cold water that does not cease, while the abdomen feels hard and constipated, and the pulse is strong and robust; this indicates a yang condition. When the mouth is thirsty but prefers warmth over cold, this is not a fire condition, and the presence of internal cold can be determined. If it is not a fire condition, what causes thirst? It is because of a deficiency of water. </p>
<p>When a patient is asked if they are thirsty and replies that their mouth is dry, but when asked if they want soup or water, they say they do not desire it. This indicates that there is no pathogenic fire within, which is why they do not crave soup or water; true yin is deficient, leading to a lack of saliva in the mouth. This is dry mouth, not thirst. One should not treat dryness as if it were thirst.</p>
<p>When yang pathogens are strong but true yin is also deficient, one should not hastily conclude that because there is a strong fire preference for cold, it can be termed as “true heat.” The internal water is insufficient, seeking external water to remedy it. When water is depleted and essence is lacking, the yin becomes desiccated, which must be carefully examined alongside the pulse signs. A slight mistake here can determine life or death. </p>
<p>I often treat patients in critical condition with severe febrile diseases who exhibit these symptoms. In such cases, I frequently use potent nourishing remedies in conjunction with cold water or alternate with ice water and cooked remedies, which has preserved many lives. Most people find it remarkable, not realizing that this approach is grounded in principles. However, only those with severe dryness and constipation may be treated with cold water; if there is no solid obstruction, one should not give water.<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Body Examination and Verification</strong><br><strong>(Qing Dynasty, Li Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>The four methods of diagnosing illnesses are observation, listening, questioning, and pulse-taking. Observing colors, listening to sounds, and feeling the pulse have been repeatedly emphasized by ancient scholars. However, the art of inquiry to acquire knowledge about illnesses has not been thoroughly developed by earlier philosophers, leaving some doubts. Why is that? When visiting a patient, asking about diarrhea to understand diarrhea, or inquiring about chills and fevers to grasp their nature, is rather superficial. This cannot be the intent of ancient wisdom. </p>
<p>One must ask when the illness began: if it started recently, it is often a new illness characterized by substantial signs; if it began a long time ago, it is likely a chronic condition featuring more signs of deficiency. </p>
<p>What food has been consumed? For instance, if ice was eaten leading to illness, apply treatments that involve ice. If there was an injury caused by meat, use herbs like cardamom or hawthorn. </p>
<p>Have there been experiences of anger, overexertion, or sexual desire? Anger damages the liver, overexertion injures the original energy, and sexual desire harms the kidneys. </p>
<p>Lastly, inquire about the initial symptoms; for example, if the initial presentation includes headache, fever, and aversion to cold, it pertains to an external pathogen.<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a></p></div>

If shortness of breath comes before bloating, the issue is in the lungs; if bloating comes before shortness of breath, the issue is in the spleen. If thirst precedes vomiting, it indicates water retention.</p>
<p>Is there a desire to drink? If there is no thirst, it indicates the absence of inner heat; if there is thirst and a desire to drink, it indicates heat. In the elderly, if there is thirst without a desire to drink, it suggests a deficiency of body fluids.

Enjoying rich flavors leads to phlegm, and drinking fine wine causes internal heat. Various questions are indeed the shortcut for the living. However, to exhaust the ancient knowledge through questioning alone is still insufficient. In a state of calm, I seem to gain some insights. The ailments of modern people, such as cough, fever, and diarrhea, are collectively named illnesses. Within one condition, there can be elements of heat and cold, phlegm and qi, deficiency and excess, leading to different origins of symptoms. For example, if a cough indicates a heat condition, then one treats it as such; if there is phlegm and qi, then treat it as phlegm and qi. Hence, through questioning, one seeks to identify the origins of the illness rather than just its name, which should align with the ancient wisdom. In the past, Master Danxi was renowned through the ages, yet he merely differentiated the conditions of cold, heat, deficiency, excess, phlegm, fire, blood, and qi for tailored treatments. Is this not the insight of someone exceptional, who sees through the organs? Ultimately, it is through questioning the symptoms that one comes to know them.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a></p></div>

Thus, primarily assessing the sun-like functions of the hands and feet is critical since the sun governs all yang energies. Prominent pupils indicate a deficiency in the spirit of the sun. The pulse of the hand solar channel extends from the cheek to the sharp corner of the eye, and its branches reach from the nose to the inner corners of the eyes. If it is deficient, the channel energy becomes urgent, leading to prominent pupils. The pulse of the foot solar channel originates from the inner corners of the eyes; when qi is cut off, death is inevitable, thus resulting in sunken eyes. Although the energies of the hand and foot channels in the yang interact and connect, any deficiency in the hand channel stems from the decline of vital qi, manifesting as depletion in the lower body leading to the upper body failing first. Therefore, deficiencies in the upper body should be nourished, while complete cessation in the lower body signifies death.

If one can induce sweating, it is permissible to wait for the right moment.

For someone who does not drink, what is the state of their pulse? The teacher said: The pulse is naturally thin, and the lips and mouth are dry. For someone who feels shame, what type of pulse do they have? The teacher said: The pulse is floating, and the complexion alternates between pale and red.

This is caused by the winter days of Ren and Gui. Why? Liver illness can affect the spleen, which should then convey to the kidneys. The kidneys are strong in the winter, and when strong, they do not accept evil. But the spleen still wants to send things back to the liver.

In the treatment of illness, one must first observe the condition of the body and then examine the pulse and inquire about the symptoms. The classics say: The method of pulse diagnosis involves observing a person's courage and fears, their muscles and skin, to understand their condition for diagnosis. The shapes of people differ: long is not equal to short, large is not equal to small, and fat is not equal to thin. The coloring differs as well: white is not equal to black, tender is not equal to faded, thin is not equal to thick.

The foot’s Taiyang is associated with water, appearing black when cold and red when hot. It is said that when the facial complexion is bright red, it indicates Yang qi stagnation on the surface and that sweating has not occurred, so it should be induced. If the pulse is floating and rapid, showing surface heat, and there is no sweating, the face appears red and radiant. It is stated that when a Yangming disease has a red complexion, it should not be attacked directly. The term \"coalesce\" implies communication; this means that surface pathogens remain unresolved and should not be attacked internally.

Such individuals tend to lie against a wall, close their eyes, and dislike bright light, preferring to avoid seeing others. Additionally, a yin toxicity manifests as pain in the body like being struck, feeling heavy as if under a mountain, and unable to turn. When influenced by dampness or wind, the body often feels heavy and painful, resulting in an inability to move side to side; it is essential to differentiate these conditions. Generally, in yang conditions, the body feels light, the hands and feet are warm, and the eyes are open with a desire to see others, indicating a chance for treatment. If the head feels heavy and vision is obscured, it suggests a disturbance of the heavenly pillar bone and the depletion of vital energy.

Color is the banner of the spirit. When the spirit is strong, the color is vibrant; when the spirit is weak, the color fades; when the spirit is hidden, the color dims; when the spirit is exposed, the color shines. The color of emperors is marked with dragon patterns and phoenix hues. The color of immortals reflects the brilliance of mountain greens. The glory of wealth shines like pearls and the luster of jade. The color of longevity and old age resembles the ancient cypress and the deep green of pines. Even the colors of poverty and early demise are heavy, murky, and stifled, lacking vitality and appearing dull and dark; all these reveal themselves on the face. For illnesses arising from within, how should their visible colors be interpreted? The “Inner Canon” emphasizes the importance of observing the face in discerning colors. Yellow on the face with various eye colors—be it green, red, white, or black—indicates survival; however, blue faces with red eyes, red faces with white eyes, blue faces with black eyes, black faces with white eyes, and red faces with green eyes all indicate death. This is because yellow represents the central hue of the earth; if a patient’s face displays yellow, unhindered by other colors, it is auspicious. A face lacking yellow but instead tainted by other colors suggests misfortune. Although the color yellow in the eyes, regardless of its depth and warmth, should not be hastily judged regarding life and death. Nonetheless, the colors reflecting the virtues and vices of the five organs reveal themselves on the face, distributed among the forehead, cheeks, nose, and jaw. The “Needling Heat” chapter states that for those with liver heat, the left cheek becomes red first; for heart heat, the forehead turns red first; for spleen heat, the nose reddens first; for lung heat, the right cheek shows redness first; and for kidney heat, the jaw reddens first. Even if the illness has not yet erupted, redness should be needled, which is referred to as treating illness before it manifests. Thus, the colors indicating the conditions of the five organs observed on the face warrant careful examination, not only concerning heat-related illnesses."},{"anchor":"trans-194p","marker":"194p","type":"translation","text":"However, there is further insight, namely the brightness of the eyes and the brilliance of the nose. The classic states that the five colors of brightness represent the essence of qi. These five colors manifest above the essence of the five organs, changing among the brightness; certain colors signify good, while others signify evil, allowing for foresight. The colors seen on the face correspond to their respective positions—above, below, left, and right—each with its significance. Thus, the brilliance around the nose provides a means to discern these colors' oppositions, as well as those of the genders, making it crucial. The subtleties of color observation are unparalleled. Zhongjing further proposed a profound principle, with the key being the central nasal bridge, which serves as the celestial cornerstone and the earthly central peak. The pathological energies of the four organs—wood, metal, water, and fire—must converge upon the central soil. For instance, when the tip of the nose appears blue, and there is internal suffering of cold pain in the abdomen, it denotes death. This remark stands out through the ages; later generations lament the absence of “On Sudden Illness,” unable to trace its origins, unaware that this statement captures its essence. The blue color of the liver's wood within the Ying Yin corresponds with the coldness of the kidney's water; it manifests at the nose and reflects in the abdomen, resulting in sudden illness leading to death. A slightly darkened tip of the nose indicates the presence of water energy, interlinking with the previous statement. Although black signifies the yin of the kidneys, a slight darkness without abdominal pain indicates water energy rather than sudden illness. A yellow hue denotes coldness in the chest, where “cold” often implies phlegm within the context of “Treatise on Cold Damage,” suggesting accumulation of phlegm in the chest. A white hue indicates loss of blood; white is associated with the lungs, which govern the upper jiao, and when the vital flow is insufficient, the nose becomes pale, indicating blood loss."},{"anchor":"trans-195p","marker":"195p","type":"translation","text":"It is said that if one sees a faint red that is not in season, it indicates death; the color of fire returns to the earth. Why hastily conclude death?

Next, regarding the observation of the eyes, it is stated that if the pupils are perfectly round, it signifies that paralysis cannot be treated. Following this, we examine the five facial colors: a blue color indicates pain; a black color indicates labor; a red color indicates wind; a yellow color indicates constipation; a bright color indicates retention of fluids. Furthermore, a yellow color indicates coldness in the chest. Each observation corresponds with the \"Neijing,\" supplementing what is lacking, and thus it may be used as a method and transmitted. The good colors are: blue like emerald feathers, red like a rooster's comb, yellow like a crab's belly, white like pig fat, and black like crow feathers. The bad colors are: blue like grass, red like magenta blood, yellow like bitter oranges, black like soot, and white like dry bones. The five organs show good colors when they possess essence and vitality; when devoid of it, the color is adverse. Initially, one does not take blue and black as major taboos. If one sees a bad color before illness, illness is bound to be severe. The \"Lingshu\" states that red appearing on both cheekbones, as large as a thumb, signifies that even a minor illness will inevitably lead to death. Black appearing at the forehead, also as large as a thumb, indicates certain death without any prior illness.

The manifestation of disease in one's color can be seen by ordinary practitioners, yet hoping to revive the dry and withered on days of no benefit is akin to multiplying efforts without result when compared to treating those who are not yet ill. Moreover, one may observe the color of someone who has long been ailing, and mistakenly think they are sick, leading the unskilled to be dazzled and suspicious, unaware that the color of the veins is not to be feared.

White is fine silk, layered upon red, bright red, dark blue, yellow, and purple; the inner colors shine through to the outside, appearing both hidden and visible. The complexion reflects what is within the flesh; how can it be different from this? Thus, the subtleties of observing colors are entirely based on observing the spirit. Blood nourishes qi, and qi nourishes the spirit; when illness occurs, these aspects become intertwined. A person who loses sleep shows a hungry spirit; a child who has lost a parent shows a dull spirit, as their qi is no longer nourished by the spirit. When a child develops smallpox, an intense inner fire is in motion, and the eyes first show a crystalline light without waiting for the pox to develop.

Color is what the eyes perceive, and pulse is what the hands hold; when combined, they go beyond mere sight and touch, fundamentally relying on the spiritual heart. The Inner Canon states that ancient practitioners skillfully assessed the color and pulse to connect with divine insights, harmonizing with the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—along with the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, always adhering to the constant principles. Thus, the significance of color and pulse can discern divine signs, linking the interplay of the elements and seasons, while the variations of winds and patterns do not stray from their regular cycles.

The pulses of both hands belong to the Taiyin channels, collectively called the inch pulse, and when they are active according to their appropriate time, the liver's dominant color should be green, with the pulse reflecting a subtle tension. If it appears white instead, it indicates a superficial pulse, and if it fails to endure during its critical time, it leads to demise. Only when the natural dominant color of the pulse is green and tense can one align with the rightful spring season. Moreover, any appearance of a white superficial pulse is a sign of malevolent forces, as are the colors red, yellow, or black, indicating that these pulses should be treated as illness, though with distinctions of severity.

If the form is correct, the reflection is correct; if the form is crooked, the reflection is crooked. Disease originates internally, thus the pulse color will inevitably reveal itself externally. Therefore, when examining a patient, one must first clarify the pulse color. However, the way of pulse color cannot be fully expressed in mere words; to grasp its essence, it relies on the four aspects of yin, yang, deficiency, and excess. If there is no distinction among the four, all is well. In general, a pulse that is surging and smooth is considered solid and yang, while a weak pulse is considered deficient and yin.

Tao Jiemian states that regardless of whether the pulse is floating, sinking, large, or small, if there is no strength detectable under pressure, and heavy pressing yields none, it is indicative of a yin condition.

There is also the \"heaven of humanity,\" which refers to the heaven that shapes us, formed from existence and grounded in ourselves. The act of being born is prior, and the act of being shaped is subsequent, thus the meanings of pre-heaven and post-heaven are revealed here. Therefore, speaking of human endowments, those endowed pre-heavenly strong and robust tend to live longer, while those weak in pre-heaven are more prone to early death. Those who are cultivated post-heaven live longer still, while those who are diminished post-heaven face even earlier demise. As for bones, they are pre-heaven; muscles are post-heaven. The spirit is also pre-heaven; appearance is post-heaven. In terms of coloration, those who are pale tend to live long, while those who are tender are more likely to perish early. Among the tender, those with some pallor are fortunate; among the pale, those with some tenderness are unfortunate. In terms of sound, fullness brings longevity, while timidity leads to early death. Although slender and long sounds are unlucky, although loud and abrupt sounds are also unlucky. Differentiating physical forms, sturdiness leads to longevity, while fragility results in early demise.

When assessing temperament, the youthful and flashy are easily filled; this is a sign of early decline. Thus, those who encompass both heaven and earth surely enjoy longevity. Those who lose their principles in both early and late phases will experience short lives without foreknowledge. If we speak of human agency, the strength from nature should not be relied upon recklessly; doing so will only lead to its loss. The naturally weaker should exercise caution; with caution, one can overcome destiny. Caution means guarding one’s emotions to protect the mind, being mindful of seasonal changes to safeguard lung energy, being restrained with indulgences to protect the liver and kidneys, and avoiding excessive labor and food to preserve the spleen and stomach. Only joy can nurture life; those who desire happiness should strive for goodness. Only blessings can ensure existence; those who seek blessings must not deceive the divine.

The \"Neijing\" says: The qi of the five organs manifests in color; if it appears green like grass, it indicates death; yellow like bitter orange indicates death; black like soot indicates death; red like fresh blood indicates death; and white like withered bones indicates death. These are the signs of death in the five colors. If it appears green like emerald feathers, it indicates life; red like a rooster's comb indicates life; yellow like a crab's abdomen indicates life; white like pig fat indicates life; and black like crow's feathers indicates life. These are the signs of life in the five colors. Life manifests in the heart as if wrapped in white cloth over red; in the lungs as if wrapped in white cloth over red; in the liver as if wrapped in white cloth over blue; in the spleen as if wrapped in white cloth over gourd; and in the kidneys as if wrapped in white cloth over purple. These are the external manifestations of the five organs. The \"Neijing\" divides colors into three categories of health, sickness, and death. The \"Lingshu\" further divides the internal organs into distinct sections, with methodologies that address the surface level and depth, as well as vitality and dispersion, signifying the importance of this principle.

If Qi and blood still exist, their colors are bright and moist, represented by the five conditions of green feathers, cockscomb, crab abdomen, pig fat, and black feathers. Although these five colors can still be generated, they ultimately correspond to an excessive color of one organ, which leads to harm and illness, not balance. A healthy person with harmonious organs will have the color of one organ that awaits its dominant one, beginning to flourish outwardly. This outward flourishing is nourished by stomach Qi, appearing in the skin and fur. The color of stomach Qi is yellow, while the color of the skin and fur is white, hence it is said to resemble being wrapped in white cloth. A white cloth wraps is hazy with luminosity; although there is shape and shadow, it is not yet radiant, stemming from the harmony of Qi and blood, the absence of conflict between Yin and Yang, and the balance among the five organs. If not, should the five organs decline, the previously hazy color changes to an excessive one; the previously bright color turns to murkiness; the previously moist color becomes withered.

Indeed, the heart fire dominates the lungs, leading to rapid and forceful exhalation, which must occur, as exhalation reflects the yang of the heart and lungs, not to be mixed with the yin of the liver and kidneys.

This is especially critical when the obstruction between the cardia and pylorus does not resolve, marking a dire situation for survival. In the upper jiao, the inhalation is quick, as the pathways of the heart and lungs are close. In cases where true yin is deficient, the yang fire rises without entering the lower jiao, hence the rapid inhalation. Therefore, one must not overlook the inhalation in the upper jiao. In the lower jiao, the inhalation is slow, since the pathways of the liver and kidneys are distant. When the original yang is declining, it is trapped by yin pathogens, making it difficult to ascend, leading to slow inhalation. Both true yin and original yang are affected, hence they are hard to treat. If the breathing is irregular and shaky, then the qi of the ying and wei is already engaged, with only a thin thread of breath remaining; is that still viable?

Like distinguishing sounds, one can understand an object just by listening to its voice; even if it is not far removed, is it not truly profound? I will briefly mention the key points from the classics. The classics state: The liver, in sound, represents the \"horn\" and in voice represents \"call\"; the heart, in sound, represents \"sign\" and in voice represents \"laughter\"; the spleen, in sound, represents \"palace\" and in voice represents \"song\"; the lungs, in sound, represent \"market\" and in voice represent \"cry\"; the kidneys, in sound, represent \"feathers\" and in voice represent \"groan.\" When speech is chaotic, it is called nonsensical, this is the mix of both void and substance. When there are unfounded shouts, it is called wild words, this is the manifestation of substance. Speech that is bold and forceful, starting light and then heavy, indicates outer influences. Speech that is hesitant and cowardly, starting heavy and then light, indicates internal injury; when words do not connect, it is the Zheng sound; when no one initiates the conversation, it is solitary speech. These three types of evidence pertain to the void. Nasal obstruction with a heavy voice indicates a cold; hoarse voice with lip sores indicates possession; sudden silence in speech with retraction indicates a phlegm condition. Snoring with blocked speech indicates warm wind; confused speech and unsteady words indicate heat. A bubbling sound below the heart, starting with thirst and followed by vomiting, indicates blocked water. A gurgling sound in the throat indicates phlegm. If the intestines rumble like thunder, it indicates disharmony in the qi, related to dampness. In young children, convulsions with an inability to speak indicate heart heat. Complete silence is like a crow’s call, indicative of death. Various illnesses causing wheezing and a hoarse voice indicate severe conditions. If one can carefully observe these signs, they can indeed save lives.

The body continues to weaken, energy is exhausted, and there is a lack of essence; the illness becomes profound, leading to sudden fears. In deeper illnesses, there is a depletion of external defenses and an internal loss of nourishment. When skilled doctors make mistakes, they do not grasp the severity of the condition. This is also one of the errors in treatment. (Note: The phrases \"wealth followed by poverty\" and \"prosperity followed by misfortune\" refer to injuries to one’s morale; hence, even without malevolent influences, the disease arises from within. The spleen stores nourishment, which expresses intention, while the kidneys store essence, which expresses will; thus, when will and intention are lost, essence and nourishment are depleted.

The joint deterioration of essence and energy occurs. When one is anxious and fearsome, it signifies a loss of long-term wealth and honors, thus one is startled by the time. This illness does not reside in the organs and bowels, nor in the body shape; essence and energy diminish daily, and the protective and nutritive systems are consumed daily. Even a skilled practitioner may not know the cause of this condition. This is the first mistake in treatment. Whenever one desires to diagnose an illness, they must inquire about diet and living conditions. Sudden pleasure and sudden suffering, pleasure followed by suffering, all harm essence and energy. When essence and energy are exhausted, the body becomes ruined and depressed. Sudden anger harms Yin, and sudden joy harms Yang. When the vital energy rises, it fills the meridians and separates from the physical form. A foolish doctor who treats this, without understanding how to tonify or drain, not recognizing the condition, will see essence and energy gradually escape, allowing evil energy to invade.

The upper half of the body represents yang, and the lower half represents yin. The muscles and skin represent yang, while the channels and blood represent yin. When yin and yang are peaceful, the qi and blood circulate smoothly both internally and externally. If one experiences violent joy, it injures yang, causing qi to bind within yang and lead to counterflow. If one experiences violent anger, it injures yin, causing blood to bind within yin and lead to a fullness in the pulse. The blood and qi of the muscular form are therefore considered to be full when they are within the pulse. Excesses should be drained away, while deficiencies should be replenished. A foolish physician treats without understanding replenishing and draining, and without understanding the condition of the disease, leading to daily loss of essence and the mingling of cold and heat pathogenic factors.

This confusion primarily arises from an inability to distinguish between cold and heat. Now, let us clarify this in detail: External cold pathogens cause fever and aversion to cold, with both cold and heat occurring simultaneously. The heat manifests as a vigorous fever, additionally producing a sensation that swells up and radiates outward, felt on the skin like the stroke of feathers, indicating that the heat is on the surface. This is a sign of external cold pathogens attacking the body's exterior. The skin and hair follicles represent the surface of Yang, nourished by the vital energy of defense.

Diseases caused by internal deficiencies occur when the exterior lacks yang, rendering it incapable of resisting wind and cold; this is common. The restless heat arising from the kidneys is different from the external cold evil. This is due to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, causing the vital qi to descend and disturb the kidneys and liver, leading to gradual weakness.

However, by avoiding wind and cold, finding warmth, or adding clothing and covers to keep warm, the aversion to wind and cold can dissipate. This warmth arises not from external cold injury, but from heat generated within the skin and hair.

This results in a steam-like internal heat that affects the head and spreads through the skin, causing the entire body to feel hot and restless. One must remain unclothed and in a cool place to relieve this condition. Alternatively, when heat becomes extreme and sweating occurs, this can provide relief.

When the restlessness presents, cold may emerge; conversely, when cold presents, restlessness may arise—this is different from the simultaneous onset of cold and heat due to external injury, which occurs without interruption.

I asked him what he enjoyed eating throughout his life. He replied that he had never missed a day of eating carp for three years. I diagnosed that there was phlegm accumulating in the lungs. The lungs are connected to the large intestine, so the foundation of the large intestine must be unstable. It was necessary to clarify the source of this accumulation for it to clear on its own.

In diagnosing an illness, one must ask what flavors are desired and what things are favored, whether it be indulging in wine or practicing vegetarianism.

A strong pulse indicates fullness, while a weak pulse indicates deficiency. As for the cause of the illness and what was injured, can it truly be known through the pulse? Therefore, a physician must not neglect to ask for the cause, and the patient must not fail to explain their reasons. Zhongnian Sun stated: It is most reliable to ask before diagnosis. Su Dongpo remarked: The difficulty of understanding the pulse is an issue both ancient and modern. In cases of deficiency, there might be an excess condition; in cases of true fullness, there can appear signs of emaciation. Between doubt and certainty lies the difference between life and death. Scholars often keep their ailments secret to test a physician’s ability. Throughout my life, when seeking treatment for ailments, I always fully disclose my conditions.

Similarly, when one is affluent but loses vitality, their condition might be misdiagnosed. Additionally, physical and mental states of joy and sorrow can result in similar ailments that require different treatments; disruptions in diet and daily routines during seasons and festivals; afflictions of worry and fear that agitate the spirit; personal preferences and aversions that create distinct dispositions; and varying individual temperaments regarding what is suitable or harmful. Without inquiry, how can one tailor treatment appropriately? Therefore, one should learn the customs of a country, understand the taboos of a family, ask the appropriate questions in a formal setting, and inquire about what the patient finds comfortable. The comfortable aspects include their living conditions, movements, responses to heat and cold, and the suitability of their emotional state. For instance, if a patient’s illness is identified as heat, one can employ cooling methods; if identified as cold, warming methods can be used.

In discussing treatment, one must not overlook the five critical principles and the core teachings of the \"Inner Canon.\" If one fails to consider the three constants in diagnosing an illness, does not recognize similarities and distinctions, does not observe the patient's spirit, and does not adhere to the teachings of the sages, then one transgresses against the standards and bears the responsibility for the failures in treatment. According to the \"Inner Canon,\" proper management prioritizes the latter over the former, which emphasizes the need to accurately assess the patient’s condition. When it comes to diet and lifestyle, the error lies in not understanding the unique emotional responses of each patient. The principles of comparison and the extraordinary versus the ordinary are crucial for physicians. Just like an experienced judge makes decisions based on precedents not explicitly mentioned in the law, physicians must rely on comparison, without missing any details. Recognizing the extraordinary and the ordinary involves careful consideration of the peculiarities of the illness. When employing comparative methods, it is essential to analyze the condition in detail, avoiding superficial or simplistic approaches.

Those who are troubled become stagnant and inactive, those filled with fear become anxious and lose their guard, those in great anger become confused and unhealed, and those who are excessively joyful become careless and cannot contain themselves. Because of these eight states, the five organs may become empty, and the blood and vital energy may become detached from their rightful place. If one often causes great harm during examination, it is not merely a loss beyond one’s share; even if the body recovers, the fluids may not nourish it. When blood and energy become internally stagnant, if they thin in the yang channels, they transform into pus, and if they accumulate for long in the abdomen, they manifest externally as cold and heat.

Therefore, when facing ambiguous and difficult cases, it is essential to employ the four diagnostic methods, thoroughly inquire into the origins of the illness, and discern the patient's voice and complexion. It is crucial to correct the order of primary and secondary issues with reason, thus attaining the truth. If one neglects this and only relies on a single diagnosis, carelessly treating at random, how can one grasp the numerous truths and falsehoods of the pulse? When discrepancies arise, how can one avoid mistakes? Moreover, those who frequently diagnose find it easier, while novices face significant challenges. This is why the four diagnostic methods should never be overlooked. Therefore, the \"Nanjing\" places pulse-taking at the end of the four diagnostics, which serves a profound purpose. Tao Jie'an also states: \"Inquire about the illness to understand its external aspects, observe the pulse to grasp its internal condition; it all hinges on the key concepts of being dynamic, which is the essence of pulse-taking during clinical practice.\" This principle is explained most thoroughly by Wang Shishan."},{"anchor":"trans-275p","marker":"275p","type":"translation","text":"**Inquiry about Cold and Heat** Inquiring about cold and heat pertains to the internal and external states of cold and heat, aiming to distinguish whether they are present superficially or internally. When a person suffers from cold, the illness manifests as heat. Therefore, any condition where the body shows signs of heat, with tight pulses, headache, body aches, and rigidity without sweating, especially if it arises suddenly, can be attributed to external pathogens. This is because the cold evil is in the meridians, causing headaches and bodily pains; the pathogen obstructs the skin and muscles, leading to rigidity and fever. If one does not have a chronic illness but suddenly exhibits these symptoms, it is often due to external influences. Since the cold evil is not something chronic but appears suddenly, this is a superficial condition. If there are no superficial symptoms but the body’s heat persists without abatement, it is more likely indicative of internal injury. However, there must be corresponding internal signs that align together to reveal the truth. In general, if body heat continues for ten days or even over a month, it may still correspond to superficial conditions. This is often because of an initial exposure to cold evil, leading to body heat and headaches. If a physician cannot discern the condition and mistakenly diagnoses it as heat, treating it with cold remedies can prevent the pathogen from dispersing, or even if it is eventually treated, if the medication does not reach the ailment, it can lead to retention in the meridians, with a prevalence of external symptoms and fewer internal signs. This does not signify an internal issue; it still requires dispersing treatment. For internal conditions that cause fever, they are mostly related to Yin deficiency or due to accumulated heat. Nonetheless, there must be corresponding internal signs, and the development of these conditions is gradual.

Yet, there must be a fluctuation of cold and heat, appearing and disappearing at times, or a timid voice with subtle sound, all indicative of yin deficiency. All forms of anger and emotional disturbances harm the liver and organs causing heat, which are collectively due to insufficiency of true yin, hence the evil fire easily ignites, indicating yin deficiency as well. Any fatigue harming the spleen resulting in fever is due to insufficiency of spleen yin, making it prone to injury. When injured, heat arises in the muscles, again suggesting yin deficiency. As for internal accumulation of heat, when symptoms of distention appear, there must be tangible evidence, and in terms of blood and qi, there must be clear signs, whether heat in the nine orifices above and below or heat in the organs within the three burners. If the heat is truly from excess, all fire-related injuries on the body that do not involve true essence will have a robust appearance in form, qi, voice, complexion, and pulse, and this should be treated with the method for excess fire. Cold symptoms are particularly evident, whether external cold indicates yang deficiency at the surface or internal cold signifies depleted fire within, similar to previous symptoms. However, excess heat tends to be more pronounced, while deficient heat is the most easily mistaken. Excess cold is usually more apparent, while there can also be some cases of true cold.

Generally, when exterior pathogenic factors are vigorous, there will be no sweating. When one is sweating, it indicates that the pathogenic factor is being expelled along with the sweat, implying the absence of exterior pathogenic factors; this is a natural principle. Thus, when the pathogenic factor has diminished completely and sweating occurs, the body cools and heat recedes, indicating the departure of the pathogenic factor. If the pathogenic factor remains in the meridians while sweating occurs only on the skin, this is not genuine sweating. After sweating, if the pathogenic factor has slightly reduced but not completely eliminated, residual pathogenic factors still exist; therefore, one should not hastily conclude that there are no exterior pathogenic factors based solely on sweating, but must carefully examine the pulse and symptoms. In instances of warmth, summer heat, and similar conditions, there are cases where sweating is caused by pathogenic factors, while others may sweat without dispelling the pathogenic factor—both are exterior symptoms. In summary, if the exterior pathogenic factors have not been eliminated, they will affect the channels externally, leading to possible pain in the head and body; if they affect the internal organs, this may cause restlessness or anxiety in the chest and diaphragm. In both exterior and interior cases, there are symptoms to rely on; whether the pulse is tight or rapid can provide diagnostic differentiation. One must discern the authenticity, vacuity, and solidity of conditions, identifying what is slight and what is severe in order to treat accordingly. If there are symptoms that are entirely unrelated to exterior factors, there may be cases of yang deficiency causing sweating, which requires tonifying the qi; for yin deficiency causing sweating, one should nourish the essence; if there is excessive fire causing sweating, one should cool it for self-recovery; if excessive drinking leads to sweating, clearing it may bring tranquility.

One can discern yin and yang through the front, back, left, and right; the presence or absence of heat reveals internal and external conditions. If it is purely an exterior pathogen, dispersing it will lead to recovery. In cases where excessive internal heat causes headaches, there must be an internal correlate, possibly located in the throat or ears, discernible by the absence of body heat or aversion to cold. Here, the heat is excessive in the upper part, with the disease being internal. One should examine which meridian is affected, and it is appropriate to clear and reduce it. High heat should be suppressed; this is the principle. If one uses a light, uplifting dispersal remedy, the fire will only rise further, worsening the pain. For headaches caused by yin deficiency, they can arise unpredictably due to excessive indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures, or due to overwork, or emotional disturbances, leading to exacerbated symptoms. This is an internal condition related to essence or qi and requires tonification. Most headaches attributed to internal factors stem from heat, which is commonly observed. However, there are cases where cold yin is present above, and yang deficiency fails to lift, resulting in intense pain. Symptoms may include aversion to cold and vomiting, and the pulses may be weak or thin.

It is necessary to consider the physical condition and differentiate between temporary and prolonged symptoms. According to the Inner Canon, when the upper is deficient, there is dizziness; when the upper is excessive, there is heat and pain, and the meaning is clear. Heaviness of the head particularly corresponds to an upper deficiency. The classic states: \"When the upper qi is insufficient, the brain is not filled, and the head suffers from tilting.\" This is what is meant. As for severe body pain, one should also examine both the exterior and interior to differentiate between cold and heat. If the pain arises from an invasion of cold, it can occur in the upper or lower body, with no fixed location, and it dissipates by itself; this is an exterior pathogen. If the pain is localized and there are no other exterior symptoms, it belongs to the category of painful obstruction; despite the pathogenic qi residing in the channels, it should be confirmed through interior symptoms, distinguishing only between cold and heat. In cases of excessive fire, there may be skin burning, persistent redness and swelling, or internal thirst; there must be corresponding heat symptoms, and treatment should focus on clearing and cooling. If there are no heat indicators but the pain persists, it is often due to yin cold, which causes blood and qi stagnation. The classic states: \"Pain is caused by excess cold; therefore, to alleviate the pain, one must warm the channels to promote the flow of blood and qi, allowing the pathogens to exit on their own.\" In cases of significant strain and sudden severe body pain, this indicates extreme yin deficiency that fails to nourish the tendons and bones, leading to a state of depletion.

Regardless of internal injury or external influences, one must observe these to distinguish between cold and heat, deficiency and excess. The preceding yin connects to the bladder, allowing one to discern its beneficial or detrimental effects, heat or lack of heat, and the strength or weakness of the body's Qi. In cases of cold damage, if urination is easy and plentiful, this indicates that the influence of the Tai Yang (Greater Yang) is not severe, which is a favorable sign. The latter yin opens the gate of the large intestine, allowing one to observe its passage or blockage, and whether there is accumulation or not, in order to gauge the deficiency or excess of the Yang Ming (Lesser Brightness). If there is feverish constipation and a hard, full abdomen, this indicates excess, and one can take measures to alleviate it. However, if recent defecation was obtained but the stool is not too dry, or if one has not defecated for ten days yet feels no bloating, then this does not indicate true Yang Ming excess. According to Zhongjing: if the stool is hard at first and then becomes liquid, it should not be purged. This shows that, although there was initial hardness, later looseness does not indicate true heat. Furthermore, if there are continuous loose stools for several days, that too can be understood. If there are no true signs of hardness, dryness, or fullness, then it is evident that there is no true excess to be attacked. Generally, if urination is merely yellow, one may think it a sign of fire, not realizing that when a person is fatigued, urination can also appear yellow.

If the urine is clear and beneficial, it indicates that the internal pathogenic influence is not severe, and the illness is not in the qi aspect. When the body’s fluids are transformed by qi, if the illness is qi-related, urination will not be beneficial. If urination gradually becomes beneficial, it indicates that the transformation of qi is evident, which is a good sign. The large intestine is the sea for the processing of food and drink, the gateway of the stomach and intestines. The bladder is the sea for blood and qi, the passageway of the chong and ren channels. Both urination and defecation are governed by the kidneys, which are essential for original qi. One must truly observe the actual pathogenic influences before discussing matters of regulation and expulsion. Otherwise, it is best to observe carefully and prudently, to avoid misguided action. If one pursues what is not real, causing the loss of original qi, those superficial pathogenic influences may take advantage of the resulting emptiness and delve deeper. Consequently, internal struggles will inevitably lead to further depletion through purging. Therefore, in cases of insufficient illness, one should not force expulsion. The ideal situation is when urination benefits by obtaining qi and transforms by itself, while bowel movements being solid indicates improved health. When both ying and wei (nutritive and defensive qi) are balanced, there will naturally be passage. Even if the large intestine is blocked for ten days or more, there should be no concern.

This is a fundamental principle. However, \"pí\" (a specific feeling of discomfort) and fullness are different and should be distinguished by their severity. In severe cases, there is a sensation of distension that feels like fullness, indicating a true evil, and one must use purgative methods. In mild cases, there is simply a lack of appetite, an inability to discern hunger and fullness, a sensation that resembles distension but is not true distension; rather, it is \"pí\" qi, or stagnant energy, which is not actual fullness. This may arise from either an evil force invading the chest or from the spleen being weak and failing to move properly.

In cases of deficiency that are urgent, tonic agents cannot afford to be administered slowly. It is essential to first inquire about the state of the chest; only then can one advance the treatment swiftly.

Nevertheless, through my observations, there has been no case that did not arise from qi deficiency.

Deafness can vary in severity; mild cases correspond to less severe illness, while severe cases indicate more serious conditions. If treatment leads to gradual alleviation, one can observe the gradual recovery of the illness; if it progresses, the disease also advances.

When the mouth is thirsty but prefers warmth over cold, this is not a fire condition, and the presence of internal cold can be determined. If it is not a fire condition, what causes thirst? It is because of a deficiency of water. When a patient is asked if they are thirsty and replies that their mouth is dry, but when asked if they want soup or water, they say they do not desire it. This indicates that there is no pathogenic fire within, which is why they do not crave soup or water; true yin is deficient, leading to a lack of saliva in the mouth. This is dry mouth, not thirst. One should not treat dryness as if it were thirst. When yang pathogens are strong but true yin is also deficient, one should not hastily conclude that because there is a strong fire preference for cold, it can be termed as “true heat.” The internal water is insufficient, seeking external water to remedy it. When water is depleted and essence is lacking, the yin becomes desiccated, which must be carefully examined alongside the pulse signs. A slight mistake here can determine life or death.

In such cases, I frequently use potent nourishing remedies in conjunction with cold water or alternate with ice water and cooked remedies, which has preserved many lives.

What food has been consumed? For instance, if ice was eaten leading to illness, apply treatments that involve ice. If there was an injury caused by meat, use herbs like cardamom or hawthorn. Have there been experiences of anger, overexertion, or sexual desire? Anger damages the liver, overexertion injures the original energy, and sexual desire harms the kidneys.
