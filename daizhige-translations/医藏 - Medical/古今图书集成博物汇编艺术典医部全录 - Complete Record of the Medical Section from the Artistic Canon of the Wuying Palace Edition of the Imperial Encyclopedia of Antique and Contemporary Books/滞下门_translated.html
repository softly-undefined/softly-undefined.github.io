<p><strong>Stagnation at the Lower Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essential Truths</strong></p>
<p>When the lesser yang governs the heavens, the fire&#39;s excess prevails, causing the people to suffer from red and white discharges. When the lesser yang is in the spring, if the fire&#39;s excess prevails, the people will suffer from discharges that are red and white, with abdominal pain and red urine; in severe cases, blood may appear in the stools. </p>
<p>In the year when the lesser yang is in the spring, if the fire&#39;s excess prevails, the discharges from the people will be red and white, leading to abdominal pain and red urine; in extreme cases, blood will be present in the urine. </p>
<p>The excess of the extreme yin results in lower abdominal pain and discharges of red and white.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Commentary: This wind is harmful.</strong></p>
<p>When the lesser yin prevails, it causes fullness in the abdomen, pain, and diarrhea, which is referred to as &quot;red feces.&quot; <strong>Commentary: Fullness in the abdomen and diarrhea indicates coldness in the lower body. The term &quot;red feces&quot; refers to excessive heat from the yin fire below.</strong> When the lesser yang prevails, there is pain in the lower abdomen and the stool is red and white. <strong>Commentary: This indicates heat prevailing below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Reversal</strong></p>
<p>When heat moves from the kidneys to the spleen, it produces deficiency, intestinal collapse, and leads to inevitable death. <strong>Commentary: The great yin, which corresponds to damp earth, governs Qi and cannot control water but instead suffers from the reciprocal effect of damp heat. If spleen Qi is deficient, it fails to process food and water, leading to intestinal collapse and diarrhea, thus resulting in a condition deemed incurable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Established Teaching</strong></p>
<p>The three yangs represent the utmost yang. When they accumulate, they cause shock, leading to sudden illnesses resembling violent winds, like thunder and lightning. All nine orifices become blocked, and the yang Qi overflows, causing dryness in the throat and blockage. When combined with the yin, both upper and lower bodies become unstable, resulting in mild intestinal collapse. <strong>Commentary: The utmost yang represents the peak of yang without limit, akin to a swift wind or the sudden arrival of thunder and lightning. When yang is abundant, it leads to shock. The nine orifices serve as reservoirs for water; when the moisture is depleted, excess yang Qi fills the orifices. Since the lungs and kidneys communicate with each other, an excess of yang and depletion of fluids leads to dryness in the throat and blockages. When combined with yin, it destabilizes the yin Qi in the upper and lower bodies, resulting in mild intestinal collapse and diarrhea.</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When yin and yang are deficient, there will be internal disruption leading to death.<br>(Note: The nourishment and energy of the body, such as qi and blood, stem from food and drink. The stomach is the organ of reception, while the intestines are responsible for transportation. If both yin and yang are deficient, then the fundamental source of life is lost, leading to death.)</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Evaluation of Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about dysentery with bloody stools? Qibo replied: Heat in the body results in death; cold results in survival. The Emperor asked: What about dysentery with white foam in the stools? Qibo replied: A sinking pulse indicates survival; a floating pulse indicates death. The Emperor asked: What about dysentery with pus and blood? Qibo replied: A knotted pulse indicates death; a slippery and large pulse indicates survival. The Emperor stated: For dysentery without body heat and without a knotted pulse, what should we consider? Qibo said: A slippery and large pulse indicates survival; a knotted pulse indicates death. This is based on the condition of the organs.<br>(Note: Dysentery occurs when evils accumulate in the intestines, causing abnormal excretion. Dysentery with bloody stools is due to the overflow of blood from the yin channels. White foam is caused by the cold fluids outside the intestines, while pus and blood occur when fluids and blood clash and are expelled together. Bloody stools indicate internal yin leakage, while fever indicates external yang depletion.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The text states: When yin and yang are in deficiency, the intestines rupture and death occurs. When there is white froth at the mouth, it indicates that the yin fluids are descending; therefore, a sinking pulse is considered normal. If the pulse is floating, it signifies an outflow of the vital energy; the pulse rises, and the channels are disconnected, which is thus regarded as a sign of death. The state of suspended death indicates the cessation of the yin fluids of the foot&#39;s shaoyin. A slippery and large pulse indicates an abundance of the vital energy of the foot&#39;s shaoyin. If the body is not warm, yang has not escaped outward. If the pulse is not suspended or severed, then yin has not descended. A suspended pulse indicates that the vital energy of the yangming has already departed, leading to death. If the stomach&#39;s qi is absent, the pulse of the true organ becomes visible, which is why it is important to consider the state of the organs. If the liver reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in eighteen days. If the heart reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in nine days. If the lung reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in twelve days. If the kidney reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in seven days. If the spleen reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in four days. A suspended pulse indicates the complete absence of the stomach&#39;s yangming qi, leaving the true organ isolated.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>Great Discussion on Anomalies</h3>
<p>The spleen pulse is externally raised; it is submerged as intestinal dysentery, which self-resolves over time. The liver pulse is slightly slow and causes intestinal dysentery, making it easier to treat. The kidney pulse is slightly rapid; it is submerged and leads to blood in the stool. If the blood causes body heat, the person will die. Heart and liver involvement also leads to blood in the stool; if both organs are affected, it can be treated. The pulse that is small, submerged, and difficult indicates intestinal dysentery. If the body is hot, the person will die. If heat persists for seven days, death occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The spleen is a Yin organ, situated in the center, receiving the force of the three Yangs. When this energy presses upward, the pulse becomes externally raised, and when it depresses downward, it results in intestinal dysentery. However, the spleen represents the utmost Yin; despite being influenced by Yang heat, it self-resolves over time. If the Yang heat depletes the Yin of the organs, causing the liver’s blood and energy to leak and weaken, the pulse becomes small and slow. The liver governs blood storage, and although it suffers from Yang evil, it remains relatively easy to treat. The kidneys govern essence, serving as the source of essence and blood. With Yang heat applied, it dilutes the kidneys, leading to blood in the stool. The pulse is small due to Yin-blood damage. Heat exhausts the kidneys, thus the pulse appears submerged and rapid. When Yin and Yang are harmonious, life arises; when imbalanced, death ensues.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>When blood is heated and injured, it becomes warm as a result. If the body is hot, it is due to the excess of the three Yang energies while the three Yin energies are depleted, leading to death. The heart governs the generation of blood, while the liver stores blood; therefore, when both the heart and liver are affected by the excess Yang energy, blood may flow downward as a consequence. If both organs are ill, the Yin blood is strong enough to combat the Yang pathogenic influences, which makes it a treatable condition. A weak and deep pulse indicates damage due to insufficient Yang. In cases of body heat, the Yang is abundant while the Yin is exhausted. Those who die after seven days have depleted the Yin energy of the six organs. This is a serious and persistent illness; the Yang energy converges directly with the Yin, resulting in damage to the Yin energy, hence the weak and strained pulse. </p>
<p>In the early stages, if the internal condition is acute, one might experience pain in the abdomen, severe diarrhea, sudden shock or faintness, or a dry throat and blocked airway. Although the body feels warm, the heat may be mild, with light external symptoms and an urgent internal condition. It is crucial to urgently use medicines that suppress Yang and nourish Yin to provide relief. If one sees mild heat in the body and uses light exterior-releasing medications, or applies mild harmonizing formulas due to the weak and strained pulse, after three days, it will become unmanageable.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>A rapid pulse indicates a disease in the yang channels, resulting in pus and blood in the stool. [Note: Yang heat is in the channels, hence the rapid pulse. Heat injures the blood level, hence the pus and blood in the stool. The menstrual blood descends, hence it is one generation.]</p>
<p><strong>Taiyin and Yangming Treatise</strong></p>
<p>If eating and drinking are excessive, and daily activities are irregular, the yin will be affected. When yin is affected, it enters the five organs, causing fullness and obstruction in the menstrual cycle, leading to diarrhea and eventually causing intestinal collapse. [Note: Entering the five organs refers to Taiyin&#39;s energy circulating through the three yins. If Taiyin is ill, all energies of the five organs will also become ill. If spleen energy is counterflowing, it causes distension and fullness. Taiyin is responsible for opening; if it is obstructed, the granaries cannot supply and thus cause diarrhea, which leads to intestinal collapse over time.]</p>
<p><strong>General Principles of the Six Factors</strong></p>
<p>Taiyang governs the affairs of heaven, where the four energies clash—wind and dampness fighting each other—causing the people to suffer from bloody discharges. [Note: The approaching energy is the jueyin wind wood, while the main energy of the four is Taiyin damp earth, thus the clash of wind and dampness. The bloody discharges are due to the interplay of dampness and heat.]</p>
<p><strong>Lingshu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the Channels</strong></p>
<p>The channel of the kidney is the lesser yin, which governs diseases originating from the kidneys, such as intestinal collapse. [Note: This is due to reversed energy below.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stagnation of Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>When there is diarrhea from the large intestine, the patient experiences discomfort after eating, with white-colored stools and painful rumbling in the intestines.<br>When there is diarrhea from the small intestine, there is pus and blood in the urine and pain in the lower abdomen.<br>When there is severe stagnation, the patient feels urgency with a heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, needing to defecate repeatedly but unable to do so, with pain in the genitals.<br>— <em>Essentials of the Golden Coffer</em> [Han, Zhang Ji]  </p>
<p><strong>Stagnation with Pus and Blood</strong></p>
<p>If there is frequent diarrhea with rapid pulse and thirst, it may resolve on its own. If not, there will certainly be pus and blood, due to the presence of heat.<br>With dysentery, if the pulse is floating and rapid on the inch position, and there is a firm pulse in the wrist, there will certainly be pus and blood.<br>— <em>The Classic of Middle Storage</em> [Han, Hua Tuo]  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Yin and Yang of the Organs: Vacuity, Fullness, Cold, Heat, Life, and Death</strong></p>
<p>If there is a severe illness causing rapid diarrhea with pus and blood, the patient has a rapid pulse and hot skin, cannot eat, has abdominal distension, and a vacant stare, the prognosis is death.<br>If the body feels cold all over, with a deep and thin pulse that shows no vitality, this also indicates death.<br>If the patient eats as normal, with a strong and intermittent pulse, this indicates survival.<br>The spleen is associated with the Earth; if it is vacuous, it leads to many accumulations, with a preference for sour foods, resulting in continuous diarrhea.<br>If the spleen qi is weak, the stools will be slippery, and defecation will be easy, leading to profuse sweating and the excretion of five fluids, causing diarrhea of five distinct colors.<br>If there is a turning of bowel adhesions, with an extremely rapid pulse, this indicates death.<br>If there are white pus discharges from the bowel adhesions, this indicates death.<br>If there is pus and blood from the bowel adhesions and the pulse is absent, this indicates death; if the stools are large and slippery, this indicates survival.<br>If there is pus and blood from the bowel adhesions, with a sensation of cold in the body and an absent pulse, this indicates death.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Prescription for a Thousand Golds</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Heat-Related Diarrhea and Other Illnesses</strong>  </p>
<p>Since I began my practice, I have encountered heat-related diarrhea three times and cold-related diarrhea once, enduring more than a hundred episodes day and night, even needing to move my bed to the toilet. The suffering was that profound. Yet, those who are self-disciplined naturally find relief; thus, I know this illness is easy to treat. However, those who indulge in their desires, arrogant and self-righteous, find good medicine hard to swallow and cannot bring themselves to discipline their eating. They hope to recover by chance, only to see the severity of their condition increase, with their stomach becoming weaker and their heart&#39;s strength diminished, making it difficult to ingest food or medicine. When they cannot recover, they call the illness difficult to treat, which is a self-deception. Learners must deeply understand this principle. Yet, this illness can be improved by taking suitable remedies; one must be resolute in self-discipline in their food intake, aiming for recovery as the ultimate goal, to ensure a cure. Moreover, one must be cautious about taste; if severe, recovery can be expected regardless. Following the methods documented in the &quot;Thousand Golds,&quot; it is important to prepare an appropriate remedy. After a hundred days, a subsequent remedy should be taken within a month. Thus, one should often lament those who cannot exercise restraint, expressing this as a great lament. There are countless formulas for diarrhea from ancient to modern times, too many to record, but I will only summarize seven or eight of effective ones. Nonetheless, the broader context rests on the practitioners themselves.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>What is there to say? For those suffering from dysentery, taking remedies such as Zhili Wan, Wumei Wan, and Songpi San will surely lead to recovery. Similarly, if one takes the Wenspi Decoction or Jianpi Wan over a long period, how can one not be cured? Generally, there are four types of dysentery: cold, hot, gnawing, and gu poison. Cold dysentery presents as white; hot dysentery is red; gnawing dysentery is a mix of red and white, lacking regularity, with excessive sleepiness; and gu poison manifests as pure dysentery with stagnant blood. For hot dysentery, one should increase Huang Lian and remove the dried ginger; for cold dysentery, add warm medicines; for gnawing dysentery, administer medicine via rectal methods; and for gu poisoning, treat with appropriate methods. If the medicines correspond properly to the condition, and one diligently takes the remedies, how can there be anyone not recovering? </p>
<p>When administering anti-dysentery medicines, the initial dosage may be intense. If a foolish person does not understand this and stops taking the medicine, it is particularly inadvisable. As long as the medicine corresponds to the source of the illness, even if the initial reaction is strong, continued use—even if it takes several times—eventually brings understanding. However, one should never take remedies that do not correspond.</p>
<p>In general, individuals with dysentery must avoid consuming raw, cold, acidic, slippery foods, including pork, chicken, fish, oil, dairy, pastries, jerky, powder, and salt. All foods should be well-cooked and soft. One must also avoid overeating. This is essential for recovery. If rest is neglected, even the wisest will not be able to help.</p>
<p>For cases of diarrhea accompanied by a slippery and rapid pulse, if there is retained food, one should address it with appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>When diarrhea has a slow and slippery pulse, it indicates fullness; diarrhea has not yet stopped, and it should be urgently treated.<br>If the pulse of diarrhea is not slippery, there should be some removal; afterward, it will improve.<br>If one with diarrhea does not want to eat, there is likely retained food, and it should be purged.<br>If diarrhea is accompanied by abdominal pain and fullness, it suggests a cold excess and should be purged.<br>If there is hardness in the abdomen during diarrhea, it should be purged.<br>If one with diarrhea is speaking incompletely, it indicates there is dried stool in the abdomen, and purging is advisable.<br>For diarrhea, if all three pulses are even, consider if there is hardness beneath the heart; it should be purged immediately.<br>If diarrhea resolves and then recurs at the designated time again, this indicates that it has not fully resolved; further purging can lead to healing. If the excess is severe with wind and cold, do not purge; afterwards, if there is hardness and pain under the heart with a slow pulse, this suggests cold, and one should only warm it. A deep and tight pulse indicates purging is also appropriate.<br>If the pulse is large and floating, purging is usually unnecessary. If the pulse is floating and rough, and bowel sounds are present, then warming is indicated.<br>If the pulse is slow and tight along with diarrhea suggesting pain that has not yet stopped, warming is advised. If cold is present, there will be fullness and stool in the intestines.<br>If diarrhea is accompanied by body aches, urgent treatment is needed inside, and warming methods can be used, including warming herbs such as Lizhong Decoction, Si Ni Decoction, and Aconite Decoction.<br>For diarrhea causing intense pain in the major orifice, warming is advisable.<br>If there is abdominal bloating and full body pain with diarrhea, one should first warm the interior and then treat the exterior.<br>For diarrhea characterized by clear liquid, do not treat the exterior, as sweating will lead to bloating.<br>For diarrhea with flatulence, one should facilitate urination.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If there is diarrhea with a wiry pulse, accompanied by fever and sweating, there will be self-recovery. If there is diarrhea with a yellow, dry tongue but no thirst, and there is heat in the chest with persistent diarrhea, it is fatal. After diarrhea, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, but if the pulse returns and the hands and feet are warm at an appropriate time, there is hope; if not, it is fatal. Generally, if the six fu organs are obstructed externally, the hands and feet will feel cold, with difficulty in breathing, and the feet may become smaller. If the qi of the five zang organs is obstructed internally, there will be incontinence. In severe cases, there will be numbness in the hands and feet. A careful examination would yield a true diagnosis. This is a general outline of diarrhea conditions.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; it is said: in spring, one may be harmed by wind; in summer, by pus and blood. Usually, diarrhea is often due to stagnation. If harmed by wind in summer, there will surely be chronic diarrhea in autumn. Autumn often brings watery diarrhea, which is related to cold. One should treat accumulated cold and heat, and food stagnation with Da Huang Decoction. Strong individuals should not take more than two doses, administering them five or six days apart before proceeding with another. For those whose Bu He Tang is ineffective, one may administer a dose every three days.</p>
<p>Traditionally, to treat dysentery, the use of Jian Pi Wan has been effective. Now, for chronic cold-type dysentery, one should first use Wen Pi Tang to clear it, and then supplement with Jian Pi Wan; there has been no case in which it has not been effective.</p>
<p>The illness of dampness and malnutrition is primarily due to excessive consumption of rich and oily foods during the hot months, combined with cold, excessive sleeping. The &quot;Li&quot; states: in the months of intense heat, a gentleman should consume mild flavors and avoid rich, oily food; otherwise, it will be detrimental to health. Those focused on wellness should heed this warning; otherwise, they risk suffering from dampness and malnutrition.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>For persistent dysentery that transforms into white pus, with dripping discharge, while warming the spleen does not yield results, the method should be to warm the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bone marrow, and white pus is another name for bone marrow. Symptoms include a slightly dark complexion and weakened bones, indicative of kidney deficiency. One should use materials such as broken old paper, Angelica sinensis, Chen pi, dried ginger, and cinnamon. It is also advisable to use Ejiao, Angelica sinensis, green peel, red Poria, and coptis as a decoction, combined with black plum and honey. This is most effective in cleansing filth; once the accumulation is removed, the flow will naturally ease. Dysentery arises from accumulation. Accumulation refers to the piling up of matter, while stagnation refers to stagnation of qi. When matter accumulates and desires to exit, but the qi is stagnant and prevents it from doing so, one experiences a descending urgency, with bowel movements coming and going, happening more than a hundred times day and night. Regardless of the color, whether red or white, or the size of the pulse, all treatments should focus on alleviation, as without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The dysentery referred to today was known in ancient times as &quot;stagnation below.&quot; Let me explain its causes: the stomach is the organ of the spleen and serves as the sea for food and drink, nourished by the essence of vitality. The large intestine, being the organ of the lungs, is responsible for the transport and transformation of substances. When people’s eating, drinking, and daily activities are out of balance, or when they exert themselves excessively, the spleen and stomach become insufficient, and the large intestine weakens. This allows external pathogens from wind, cold, summer heat, and dampness to enter, leading to dysentery. Generally, when there is heat injury, it results in red dysentery; cold injury causes white dysentery; wind injury leads to pure discharge of clear blood; and dampness results in discharge resembling bean soup. If one drinks cold beverages and indulges in excess, leading to damage of essence and blood, it can result in chronic toxic dysentery. Even though healing can be guided by the symptoms, it is often lamented that when people initially contract this illness, they frequently resort to using poppy husks, pomegranate peels, galla chinensis, and nutmeg to stop the diarrhea.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Little do people know that dysentery is often caused by food stagnation in the intestines and stomach. If one does not first use substances like dhupa beans to eliminate this stagnation and drive out the foulness, it is rare not to face severe physical distress, leading to weakness over time. Whenever I encounter this condition, I always begin by purging the intestines and stomach, then addressing the root issue, and subsequently discerning the influences of wind, cold, heat, and dampness to determine the treatment method. Therefore, if there is heat damage resulting in redness, I cool it; if there is cold damage leading to paleness, I warm it; if there is wind damage with a pure discharge of blood, I expel it; and if there is dampness causing a discharge resembling bean curd soup, I promote its elimination. In cases of alternating cold and heat, I adjust with a mix of warmth and coolness; for chronic toxic dysentery due to injury, I detoxify to protect health. Thus, every remedy shall be effective, and all ailments shall be cured. However, one must also observe the pulse for its strength or weakness. If there is a weak, fine pulse with diarrhea, life can be sustained; but a floating, strong pulse indicates difficulty in treatment. For a condition characterized by frequent discharge of pus and blood, the pulse should be slippery and strong; if it is tense and tight, death is certain. Additionally, if the body feels cold, life is preserved; if it feels hot, death is imminent. Examining and treating according to these observations at the time of illness, one is rarely mistaken.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>The Six Diseases of the Hejian (by Liu Wanshu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea is caused by pressure from the lower body, which leads to urgency and discomfort. The nature of fire is swift and capable of drying things out. When the intestines and stomach are obstructed, the process of transformation fails, resulting in diarrhea.</p>
<p>As for dysentery, it occurs when the internal organs become burdened by toxins: they congeal but do not disperse. This can happen due to exposure to cold substances, or from being exposed to cold and hot temperatures, leading to a lack of appetite that prevents digestion. Additionally, consuming excessive cold or hot foods can cause harm, or taking overly warm medicines can result in a buildup that leads to dysentery. </p>
<p>Ancient wisdom categorizes white dysentery as cold and red dysentery as hot, which is a misunderstanding. In modern times, when sores and boils first appear, and a cut releases blood, they turn into pus after several days—why then consider it hot at first and cold thereafter?</p>
<p>Shuhe mentions that excessive moisture causes the five types of diarrhea, with the intestines moving like thunder in a storm. Unwise doctors do not understand that the yellow discharge is heat, while greenish dysentery is cold. The &quot;Great Substance&quot; states that the five types of diarrhea are: watery, duck, food, moist, and slippery. These correspond to different elements: blue represents the influence of the liver wood; red, the spirit of the heart fire; and white, the energy from the lung metal in the west.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The color yellow corresponds to the earth of the spleen. The color green indicates the energy of the body, which is supported by water, manifesting as a green hue. If there is severe diarrhea accompanied by intense heat, frequent and painful straining, or if it persists and cannot be relieved by various medicines, it is necessary to purge it in order to eliminate dampness, heat, and blockages, and to promote the circulation of vital energy and fluids. It is advisable to chase away these issues while also promoting the passage of accumulated heat.</p>
<p>Diarrhea related to the organs exhibits many signs. Generally, it can be understood from the perspectives of wind, dampness, and heat, where there is more heat than cold, and excessive cold cannot sustain for long. Thus, it is said that acute diarrhea is not due to Yang, while chronic diarrhea is not due to Yin. It is stated: in spring, one should take a gentler approach; movement leads to the flourishing of the liver wood. Conversely, excessive stillness means engaging in the autumn&#39;s order, where metal can control wood. With wind energy concealed within, during the summer solstice, fire flourishes while metal departs, fire is isolated, and wood becomes vigorous, which harms the earth of the spleen. In mild cases, there may be loose stools with body heat, a rapid pulse, and food cannot be transformed; in severe cases, there may be diarrhea with thick, sticky pus and blood, all of which relate to fire.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The classics say: When there is leakage leading to pus and blood, one knows the qi is moving and the blood stops; it is appropriate to use a large dose of Da Huang Decoction, which is a heavy remedy. The Huang Qin and Shao Yao Decoction serves as a lighter remedy. When there is excess, it purges the root; wood can become empty, thus strengthening the spleen’s earth. Therefore, the classics state: If spring is harmed by wind, summer will surely result in diarrhea. This is contrary to the seasonal qi and a result of one’s own actions. If the Taiyin Spleen Meridian is affected by dampness, it can lead to watery diarrhea and a feeling of heaviness, without knowing the flavors of grains. In the spring, it is fitting to use Yi Huang Powder to replenish; in the summer, it is fitting to purge. The rules state: One should replenish, harmonize, and stop. To harmonize, there is the Shao Yao Decoction; to stop, there is the He Zi Decoction. If this persists, it may change into pus and blood. The Spleen Meridian connects to the Kidney and is referred to as a thief of evil, which makes recovery difficult. If diarrhea occurs before the slippery condition, it is called a minor evil, making recovery easier. All this is due to the Spleen’s earth being affected by dampness, a matter of Heavenly action, which even the wisest cannot escape. The mouth consumes flavors and the nose takes in qi; through the nose it enters, accumulates in the spleen, and leads to watery diarrhea.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>When the Jueyin channel is affected, and there is persistent diarrhea, the pulse is deep and slow, the hands and feet are cold and reversed, there is mucus and blood in the phlegm, this condition is difficult to treat; it is appropriate to use Ephedra and Xiao Xueming Decoction. The principle states that there is an external pathogen constrained within, and it should be dispelled to achieve recovery. In cases of sudden diarrhea without sound, body cold with spontaneous sweating, clear and smooth urination, and uncontrolled defecation, with difficulty in breathing and a weak pulse causing nausea, strong warming herbs should be urgently used to resolve the issue. The method states: if there is heaviness afterwards, it is appropriate to drain; if there is abdominal pain, it is appropriate to harmonize; if there is body heaviness, it is to eliminate dampness; if the pulse is wiry, it is to dispel wind. Thick and sticky pus and blood should be forced out with strong herbs. For body cold with spontaneous sweating, toxic herbs should be used to warm. When the wind pathogen is constrained within, sweating may lead to recovery. If there is watery stool, it should be warmed. Additionally, it states: for conditions on the surface, induce sweating; for those within, induce purging; for those above, induce vomiting; for those below, deplete. If there is heat on the surface, it should be cleared internally; if urination is difficult, it should be facilitated. It further mentions: those in excess should be harmonized, those in deficiency should be supported, and those in excess should be stopped. The military strategy says: evade the incoming sharpness and strike at the returning slackness. This is what this means.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>When there is illness characterized by diarrhea and an aversion to wind and cold, it is due to the transmission of the Taiyin to the Shaoyin, where wood overcomes earth. Use dampness-removing Bai Zhu, Fu Ling to calm the spleen, and Shao Yao, Gui, and Huang Lian to break up blood. Fire evil cannot overcome water. The Taiyin channel cannot transmit to the Shaoyin, while the fire evil ascends to the lung channel, leading to dysentery producing white pus. Add Huang Lian and Dong Gui to the treatment. </p>
<p>If there is a sense of urgency in the bowels with heaviness in the rear, and the pulse is large and rapid, it indicates internal heat causing stagnation. If the pulse is floating and excessively large, one should avoid purgatives; although there is urgency and heaviness, if the pulse is deep, thin, and weak, it indicates cold evil inside with dispersed qi, which can be warmed and nourished to heal. </p>
<p>For urgency and heaviness with closed bowels, it indicates the large intestine channel&#39;s qi is not flowing. It is advisable to add Mu Xiang and Bing Lang to promote its flow. If there is diarrhea or dysentery accompanied by vomiting, it indicates disharmony in the stomach qi. For disharmony in the upper burner, treat with ginger and orange peel. For disharmony in the middle burner, use Shao Yao, Dong Gui, and Fu Ling. For disharmony in the lower burner due to cold, treat with mild heat or strong heat herbs.</p>
<p>If there is weak constipation that does not improve for a long time, there is concern that the Taiyin transmission to the Shaoyin may transform into dysentery. The Taiyin itself is considered a harmful evil, and one should first use Zhi Shi and Hou Po decoction to prevent its transformation. </p>
<p>If the limbs feel lazy and fatigued, with scanty or unobstructed urination, and difficult, heavy stool, with reduced appetite, it is advisable to regulate the stomach and eliminate dampness with Bai Zhu, Shao Yao, and Fu Ling in a decoction. The sweetness of Bai Zhu can enter the stomach and remove spleen and stomach dampness; the sour nature of Shao Yao can eliminate damp heat from the stomach; the light drainage property of Fu Ling can smooth the water pathways and eliminate dampness. These three ingredients are essential for treating dysentery and diarrhea.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>If there is fever and aversion to cold, with no abdominal pain, add Huangqin as the main herb; if there is aversion to cold without visible pus, it indicates the Greater Yin is wanting to transmit to the Lesser Yin, add Huanglian as the main herb, supplemented by Guizhi; if there is severe abdominal pain, add a double dose of Danggui and Shaoyao; if there is blood present, add Huanglian as the main herb, supplemented by Guizhi and Danggui; if there is agitation, or if there is first white pus then blood, or fever, or aversion to cold, it cannot be resolved without Huangqin, for this is blood in the upper part.</p>
<p>If there is aversion to cold with a deep pulse, or back pain, or blood dysentery with abdominal pain, it cannot be resolved without Huanglian, for this is blood in the middle part.</p>
<p>If there is a mixture of pus and blood in the stool, with a floating large pulse, be cautious not to use Dahuang to purge it, for doing so will surely lead to death, as it causes Qi to drain downward, leaving Yang with nothing to hold onto. In general, when Yin and Yang are not harmonized, they can only be treated with medicines that divide Yin and Yang. It is also said: acute diarrhea indicates Yang, chronic diarrhea indicates Yin. When stool fully descends, there can be cold and heat. The heated condition has a rapid pulse, the body is often active, the voice is loud, and there is forceful urge to expel; this is Yang. The cold condition has a deep, thin, rapid pulse, the body is inactive, the eyes are dull, appetite is absent, and the breath is faint; this is Yin, which is treated with Jiangfu Decoction.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If the body feels heavy and the limbs cannot move, then Angelica is attached to the Yang. For long-standing diarrhea or sudden severe cases, it is all a result of the Taiyin channel being affected, so it must not be separated from Peony. If one is not suffering from dampness, they cannot have diarrhea; thus, White Atractylodes is essential. Therefore, the sage established a method: for diarrhea in all four seasons, within Peony and White Atractylodes, in spring add Siler, in summer add Scutellaria, in autumn add Magnolia, in winter add Cinnamon and Aconite. Additionally, one must consider external symptoms of cold and heat; if there is urgency with heaviness afterwards, one should add Rhubarb; if there is fatigue and weakness, add White Atractylodes; if there is sweating all over with a slight cold breath, add Cinnamon and Aconite to warm it; if there is heaviness afterwards, with thick, sticky pus and blood, even in midwinter, add Rhubarb to the damp medicines. Following any diarrhea, if there is slight relief but intolerable empty pain in the abdomen, this is a severe imbalance between Yin and Yang; one should take the highly effective Yao Tao powder. To treat cold accumulation diarrhea, it does not matter if it is seen in men, children, or women—whether it is red or white, or clear liquid like water and not heavy afterwards, it indicates cold. The classics state: clear and cold are both associated with cold. This results from vacuous cold coupled with accumulation, suitable for Aconite or Areca to purge it. If relief is seen, take it on an empty stomach.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If one experiences diarrhea with pus and blood, it is due to the large intestine’s discharge. If the pulse above the five regions is surging, one should use the Seven Xuan Pill. If the pulse is steady, from the beginning of autumn to the spring equinox, one should use the Xianglian Pill; from the spring equinox to the beginning of autumn, the Shaoyao and Huangbai Pill is recommended. Throughout the four seasons, it is advisable to adjust with Pingwei Powder or the Seven Xuan Pill. Subsequently, one should take this medicine to expel remaining evils and harmonize the stomach qi.</p>
<p>Throughout the four seasons, the stomach qi is fundamental. Prolonged blood dysentery leads to spleen deficiency, causing blood not to circulate to the limbs, but rather accumulates in the stomach as blood. Nourishing the spleen and stomach is necessary for recovery. </p>
<p>For the illness of five types of diarrhea, the treatment methods differ due to varying external symptoms. If it&#39;s gastric diarrhea, with undigested food leading to a yellowish discharge, one should use the Chengqi Decoction. For spleen diarrhea, characterized by abdominal distension, fullness, and vomiting upon intake, one should use the Jiangzhong or Lizhong Decoction.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>For large intestine diarrhea, characterized by urgent urge to defecate, white stool, and intestinal rumbling with sharp pain, the treatment is ginger and aconite decoction. For small intestine diarrhea, which presents with pus and blood in the urine and stool, alongside lower abdominal pain, the remedy is the Chengqi decoction. For great knot diarrhea, symptoms include urgency with a heavy feeling after defecation, repeated unsuccessful attempts, pain in the dorsal region, and difficulty urinating; this relates to the kidneys. In relation to the five types of diarrhea: the symptoms of the stomach, small intestine, and great knot can all be addressed with the Qingliang Yinzi to stop the diarrhea. The conditions of Jueyin and Shaoyin require separate treatments. For Jueyin symptoms, licorice is added to address the pain in the dorsal region, which is associated with the liver. The Inner Canon states that when the liver is in distress, sweet food should be consumed to ease it. The Shaoyin symptoms often involve urgency with a heavy feeling, hence the addition of rhubarb to promote expulsion, leading to relief. It also states that one should reduce the heaviness when necessary, and “what is below should be drawn out and exhausted.” There are also conditions related to the Taiyin and Yangming channels that suggest the administration of the Dachengqi decoction should be considered. For Taiyin symptoms with inability to eat, nourishment should be provided first, followed by a purging medicine.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>First, decoct half a tael of magnolia bark, using one and a half cups of water according to the original prescription, and boil it until reduced by half, then take it. If after taking three taels it hasn&#39;t resolved, it indicates undigested food. Then add two qian of bitter orange and decoct them together for consumption. If you still have diarrhea after taking three taels, it may be due to leftover food and heat toxicity; add three qian of rhubarb to push it through and stop the diarrhea. If diarrhea persists, this suggests long-standing residue in the intestines; add half a he of Glauber&#39;s salt to thoroughly eliminate the old residue and achieve recovery.</p>
<p>The white diarrhea is associated with cold; blue, yellow, red, and black are all associated with heat. The color white from diarrhea corresponds to the lung’s color. When cold water is excessive, it suppresses fire, which fails to regulate metal, leading to an excess in the lung, hence the white coloration, similar to how turbid water settles into clear, bright ice. Blue corresponds to the liver and wood; when fire is abundant, it suppresses metal, leading to an excess in wood, thus the blue color. Some say that the color blue being associated with cold is a misunderstanding.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Zhongjing said: &quot;In cases of Shaoyin disease with clear water diarrhea, if the color is pure blue, it indicates that there is heat inside; in this case, use the Da Chengqi Decoction. When a child experiences severe heat leading to acute fright, with the diarrhea appearing mostly blue, it indicates clear heat. If the color is yellow, it is due to excessive fire, which causes the water to decline, and the spleen&#39;s earth to flourish, hence the yellow color. Red indicates heat from the heart fire, while a deep red suggests severe heat. As for black diarrhea, it is also attributed to heat; if fire heat reaches an extreme, it consequently affects the water, rendering it black. In cases of Typhoid Yangming disease with severe heat, there may be afternoon tidal fever, and in severe cases, the person may not recognize others, feel around for clothes, or talk to themselves as if seeing ghosts; the remedy is to administer Da Chengqi Decoction. If the stool is not black, treatment is easier; if black, it is more difficult. The same principle applies to dysentery. However, to distinguish the color of dysentery for the purpose of discerning cold and heat, one should also closely observe the colors of the food and medicine consumed. In cases of children with heat, vomiting, and diarrhea, if the stool is still white due to undigested milk, one should not hastily conclude it is cold; instead, differentiate based on pulse and signs. The general principle is that diarrhea and clear, unclouded urine indicate cold, while red indicates heat.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If the grains do not digest but the complexion remains unchanged, with foul and smelly excretions, clear and cool urine, body feeling cold without thirst, and the pulse being slow, fine, and weak, this indicates a cold syndrome. If the grains do not digest but the complexion changes to something other than white, with restlessness and thirst, and urine appearing red or yellow and possibly turbid, this indicates a heat syndrome. Generally, if grains are digested, regardless of color or other symptoms, it signifies heat. Cold diarrhea with grain digestion has never been seen, as cold prevents the digestion of grains. Moreover, if heat is excessive and rapid, the transformation becomes abnormal, and grains cannot digest, leading to diarrhea—this can also occur. Zhongjing said: &quot;Pathogenic heat does not kill grains.&quot; However, if heat combines with dampness, it leads to diarrhea. The assertion that white diarrhea indicates cold is mistaken.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>If it is cold, it cannot transform food, so how can it then turn into pus? The so-called diarrhea transforming food into pus and blood is like grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables in the world; when dampness and heat are excessive, they naturally rot, break down, and turn into turbid water. Thus, when food is in the stomach, if it encounters the damp-heat evils from people, it naturally breaks down, turning into pus and blood. The heat is red, belonging to the fire of the heart. The dampness is yellow, belonging to the earth of the spleen. The dryness and stagnation is white, belonging to the metal of the lung. The scripture says: all obstructed qi belongs to the lung, indicating the transformation of dry metal. Wang Bing said: the constrained and urgent qi is used by metal. However, all diarrhea and dysentery involve dampness, and now if one speaks of dry qi, it indicates that the damp-heat is stronger within the intestines and stomach, causing heat to become stagnant, with dampness dominating, which leads to qi and fluids not being able to unfold, thus resulting in dryness in the intestines and stomach, making thirst unending. If there is red and white diarrhea, the common saying that cold and heat are combined is particularly erroneous.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>How can one understand the interplay of water and fire, yin and yang, cold and heat? It is like the balance; when one side is high, the other must be low; when one side is full, the other must be weakened. Can cold and heat both be excessive in the intestines and yet result in the same dysentery? When heat causes sores and discharges white pus, can it be interpreted as cold because of the whiteness? The white indicates its relation to the skin, belonging to the lung metal; hence its color is white. When it pertains to the blood vessels and belongs to the heart fire, it manifests as blood sores. In the muscles, associated with the spleen earth, it produces yellow pus; in the tendons, linked to the liver wood, it shows a greenish color; when it penetrates deeply to the bones, belonging to the kidney water, it results in purple-black blood. Each follows the corresponding organ and displays the five colors, which is termed a sign. Fundamentally, it all arises from heat, merely varying in depth. The major symptoms include pressing pain and urgency in the lower abdomen, with red and turbid urine, all indicating dryness and heat. Meanwhile, white dysentery must also occur frequently, thereby clearly indicating heat.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Some say: Since dysentery is a heat disease, why do we use pungent and heating medicines, and yet some recover? This is because pungent and heating medicines can open up blockages in the intestines and stomach, aiding the flow of qi and fluids, moistening the dryness, and harmonizing the qi. Therefore, those with mild cases can recover, but those with severe blockages will worsen, and their condition may lead to death. This is also true for treating severe vomiting and diarrhea. </p>
<p>In treating various forms of dysentery, it is best to use bitter and cold medicines, sometimes slightly supplemented with pungent and heating ones. Pungent and heating substances disperse and unblock, while bitter substances dry up moisture, and cold ones conquer heat, helping to restore the balance of qi. Medicines like Qian&#39;s fragrant linked pill are examples of this approach. </p>
<p>Thus, for treating dysentery, Huanglian (Coptis) and Huangbai (Phellodendron) are primary medicines, emphasizing the treatment of damp-heat diseases with strong bitterness and coldness. </p>
<p>However, the commonly used pungent and heating medicines, even poisonous substances, sometimes help treat various forms of vomiting, diarrhea, and dysentery because they effectively open up blockages. Yet, even though there may be some efficacy, they can also backfire and become toxic. </p>
<p>When using very toxic medicines, they should only be considered when no better options are available, necessitated by the situation. Fortunately, there are effective medicines that, though not always yielding results, can be beneficial without harm. Why then use highly toxic medicines and risk additional complications? The classics say: &quot;It is better to choose the small over the large, the good over the toxic.&quot; This is what is meant by that.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>On Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The scripture states: &quot;Lower abdominal pain and heat cause the excretion of white fluids.&quot; The term &quot;pain&quot; refers to stagnation. This illness does not originate from the primary channel but arises from stagnation in other channels causing this disease. The term &quot;pain&quot; can also mean a guest, signifying something that is lingering. A guest that causes heat in the lower abdomen, persisting for a long time, transforms into white through the action of metal. </p>
<p>If there is dysentery that is both red and white, the red indicates a new accumulation stemming from heart fire; the white indicates an old accumulation due to lung metal. Therefore, red and white dysentery cannot be simply categorized as hot or cold; one should only differentiate between new and old for treatment. For example, in the case of abscesses starting with red blood, followed by the emergence of white pus, how can one attribute it only to cold? Yet the patient remains unconvinced. </p>
<p>Liu Hejian often discussed this, stating that &quot;excess cold results in white,&quot; and thus recommends dried ginger and red shijinshi. While the Tao Hua pill may effectively treat dysentery, it may later lead to blood diseases. In cases of leukorrhea, directly using white peony root and dried ginger might resolve the leukorrhea, but it will inevitably cause difficulty in urination. </p>
<p>Both treatments for diarrhea and leukorrhea should avoid the sudden use of harsh and hot drying medications. Applying such drying methods will deplete internal fluids, leading to a feeling of thirst; with thirst, urination becomes difficult, and difficult urination can lead to swelling of the feet, potentially progressing to a point of no return.</p>
<p>For rectal hemorrhage, one can use the stomach-regulating Chenshi Decoction with the addition of angelica. After purging, next use the white peony and bark of phellodendron pills, as well as Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, Wuling, and Yiyuan, adjusted to take five to seven qian.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The Inner Canon states: How does one treat intestinal bleeding with diarrhea? The response is: &quot;Bleeding refers to water accumulation in the intestines. If the body is hot, it leads to death; if cold, it leads to recovery. Heat causes blood and qi to deteriorate, hence death; cold preserves nourishment and life. Those who die within seven days succumb due to the effects of fire.</p>
<p>In cases of severe diarrhea with pus and blood, and persistent abdominal pain, one may use the Adjusting the Stomach and Purging Qi Decoction, adding fresh ginger and jujube for decoction; if it does not suffice, take seven to eighty pills according to one&#39;s condition to adjust and relieve. Then use long-flowing water to prepare five-argyllium powder, in amounts of five to seven qian, possibly adding light reed decoction or mixing with Aiyuan powder in similar amounts. Avoid all greasy and hot foods, and recovery will follow.</p>
<p>For diarrhea due to the small intestine, with pus and blood in urine and feces, and pain in the lower abdomen, one should use cold and gentle agents to relieve the condition. In cases of urgency with pressure and inability to defecate, begin with clear cold preparations to relieve it, then apply gentle and sweet kinds afterward. Pain in the stem area may also be treated similarly.</p>
<p>For bleeding in diarrhea characterized by pus and blood in feces, one should use Wu’er pills, Dihuang powder, Zhuchun pills, and Plantago seed, and also employ gentle or sweet medicines as needed. </p>
<p>In general, for persistent diarrhea with pus and blood and unceasing abdominal pain, what causes this? All pain and itch relate to heart fire; one may use the Tongjie pill, adjusting the dosage based on the condition, to relieve it; then use the Xiao Shi powder with fresh ginger, jujube, and peony to purge further, followed by taking the five-argyllium powder mixed with fresh water.&quot;<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Intestinal Moisture and Blood</strong></p>
<p>The Theory of Taiyin and Yangming states: Irregular eating and drinking and untimely daily routines cause the Yin to receive these disturbances. When the Yin is affected, it enters the five organs; when it enters the five organs, it leads to fullness and obstruction (of the menstrual essence), resulting in fermentation and eventual intestinal moisture. Intestinal moisture represents water and food combining with blood, pushing out like a spout from a barrel. During the long summer, when dampness and heat are at their peak, the pathogenic factors are dominant and the body&#39;s defenses are weak, leading to severe cases of intestinal moisture. Therefore, treat it with a cooling blood formula containing Rehmannia.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong>  </p>
<p>Dysentery with red stools pertains to blood, while white stools pertain to qi. If there is body heat followed by heaviness and abdominal pain with blood in the stool, and if the body heat is accompanied by an external pathogen, remove ginseng from Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. The heaviness is due to accumulation and qi descending, thus both ascending and dispersing are required, suitable methods include Mu Xiang and Bing Lang pills. If not cured, use Qin Jiao, Zao Jiao Zi, and the decoction of Da Huang, Dang Gui, Tao Ren, Huang Lian, and Zhi Ke; if there is strong intestinal wind, it can be taken in pill form. Baohe Pills are also effective for heaviness caused by accumulation. After five days, do not induce purgation, as this is due to spleen and stomach deficiency. If heaviness is distressing, one should harmonize the qi using Mu Xiang or Bing Lang. For abdominal pain, it is the lung metal qi congested in the large intestine. If the condition is real, treat according to Liu&#39;s method; if deficient, use bitter herbs to disperse, then apply dysentery medicine. For qi-related issues, use qi medicines; for blood-related issues, use blood medicines. If there is heat, use Huang Qin and Shao Yao; if there is no heat with abdominal pain, consider warming herbs like ginger and cinnamon. Blood in the stool primarily relates to food accumulation and heat, or may involve the use of (stone salt). Moreover, Qing Liu Pills are effective for blood dysentery.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>In the initial one or two days of dysentery, the principle is to induce bowel movements; one must not hastily use agents to stop diarrhea. If it is severe, one should regulate the stomach with methods like the Chengqi Decoction, including both the Da and Xiao Chengqi formulas, to purge. If there is heat, first dispel the heat, then assess the conditions of qi, blood, and adjust the medications accordingly; do not hastily use ginseng or atractylodes. However, those with qi deficiency may use these, and those with stomach deficiency can also use them.</p>
<p>For blood dysentery that does not improve over time, it is due to yin deficiency, primarily using the Siwu Decoction. To cool and harmonize the blood, use herbs such as angelica and peach kernels. If there is persistent diarrhea with fever, it indicates yin deficiency; cold and cooling medicines must be combined with ascending and dispersing medicines, along with heated remedies.</p>
<p>For dysentery with severe abdominal pain, it is due to heat moving downward. Use herbs like nutmeg, betel nut, Coptis, and Scutellaria, as well as fried ginger. For cases of locked mouth dysentery, it is due to severe heat in the stomach. With great deficiency and great heat, use half of Xianglian Pills and lotus seeds, ground into powder, mixed with rice soup to take. Another formula involves two parts of ginseng and one part of ginger juice fried with Coptis, ground into powder, simmered thick, and sipped throughout the day. If there is vomiting, take again. Just one sip will open up the throat. Many do not realize this and often use warm, sweet medicines, which only exacerbate the fire and stagnation.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Sealing the navel to draw down heat involves mixing a small amount of musk into a paste made from the flesh of freshwater snails and applying it in the navel. Signs of untreatable conditions: if the discharge resembles fish brain, the patient is half dead, half alive; if it appears like dirty dust, the patient will die; if it is pure blood, the patient will die; if it resembles water leaking from a roof, the patient will die; if it flows like bamboo being poured, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>Red dysentery originates from the small intestine, while white dysentery comes from the large intestine, both caused by damp heat. Red and white dysentery with turbidity can be treated similarly.</p>
<p>If there is an invasion of wind causing a downward descent, it should be lifted; as wind harms the liver, which governs wood. If dampness injures the blood, one should disperse dampness and clear heat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that heat in the body leads to death, while cold brings life; this is a generalized statement and must be assessed with accompanying symptoms for accuracy. Surely, there are cases without body heat that lead to cold and death, correct?</p>
<p>A pulse that is deep, small, or subtle is easy to treat. A pulse that is large and rapid is difficult to treat. The pulse should be smooth and large, not tight and urgent.</p>
<p>Zhongjing treats dysentery with five methods for warming and ten methods for purging. Some methods relieve the exterior, some facilitate urination, and some rely on the body&#39;s natural healing. There are clear distinctions between easy, difficult, and untreatable cases, which are very thorough. However, since it is similar to diarrhea, the theories should not be conflated; learners should discern the differences.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Severe abdominal pain can be treated by warming or clearing. For long-standing cold illnesses with a submerged and weak pulse, warming is appropriate; for sudden illnesses with heat and a floating and strong pulse, clearing and nourishing is recommended. If there’s anything to expel through vomiting, sweating, or purging, it can be done.</p>
<p>In the initial stages of illness, when the vital energy is not yet depleted, it’s essential to push and promote circulation, which is the basic principle of treatment. However, if the illness has persisted and caused energy deficiency, purging is not suitable. Strong and healthy individuals in the early stages of illness should be purged, while the weak, frail, or elderly with prolonged illnesses should be nourished.</p>
<p>When purging, start with watery excrement, then move to purulent blood. This reflects the transmission from the spleen to the kidneys, indicating the difficulty of eliminating harmful pathogens. If purulent blood is expelled first and followed by watery excrement, this shows the transmission from the kidneys to the spleen, making it easier to recover from mild pathogens.</p>
<p>Diarrhea resembling bean juice indicates dampness. The spleen and stomach are the seas of water and grain, absorbing everything and often involving all four organs, leading to a mixture of the five colors; thus, the initial focus should be on unblocking and facilitating the flow. Even the weak should be examined carefully. If the diarrhea is due to heat, rash beans should not be used; if caused by cold substances, they may be applied but with caution.</p>
<p>Additionally, during epidemics presenting as diarrhea, when a family infects one another similarly, it’s best to emphasize the balance of nutrition and recovery in treatment.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>If one experiences chills and fever, with pain in both the body and head, this indicates an exterior condition. It is advisable to induce a slight sweat for resolution, using a decoction of Atractylodes, Mutong, Chuanxiong, Chenpi, Shaoyao, Licorice, and three slices of Ginger.</p>
<p>If there is abdominal pain with a feeling of heaviness, frequent but small urination, and accumulated blockage, this indicates an interior condition. It is best to harmonize and disperse qi, using a decoction of fried Zhigou, processed Houpo, Shaoyao, Chenpi, Huashi, and Licorice.</p>
<p>If there is an abnormal sensation of heaviness with dark blood in the accumulation and severe pain, this is indicative of stagnant blood. The method should be to crush and grind Peach kernels and Huashi to promote movement.</p>
<p>If there is thirst and dry, painful stools, this is termed heat retention, and Huangqin should be added. If there is no thirst, no fever, and a preference for warmth, this indicates cold retention, and Ganjiang should be added.</p>
<p>If there is a sensation of heaviness after the menstrual flow, this indicates qi stagnation; therefore, add one Betel nut to the previous medicine.</p>
<p>If the discomfort is in the lower abdomen with a sensation of heaviness, and in the upper abdomen with nausea and eating difficulties, this signifies unresolved toxicity and unbalanced stomach qi. One must identify whether it is due to cold (to warm) or heat (to clear), and if there is deficiency, to use Ginseng and Atractylodes for supplementation. Addressing the toxicity will help the digestion restore.</p>
<p>If there is fatigue and a feeling of insufficient qi, along with aversion to food, this indicates a concomitant deficiency. It is advisable to add Atractylodes and Angelica. If the patient is severely deficient, add Ginseng. In cases of extreme deficiency, use only Ginseng along with Chenpi for supplementation. When deficiency recedes, dysentery will naturally stop.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If one&#39;s qi is flowing and blood is harmonious but accumulates little, and they merely sit idly resulting in responsibility, this indicates a deficiency of blood. One should use a greater amount of angelica root and its tail, alongside raw white peony root, raw rehmannia root, and raw peach kernel as assistants, and combine them with aged tangerine peel to harmonize, allowing the blood to nourish and stabilize.</p>
<p>If there is a feeling of heaviness and reduction by seven or eight tenths, and the filth has been eliminated but the dregs are not yet resolved, one should prepare a decoction of stir-fried white peony root, stir-fried white atractylodes, roasted licorice, aged tangerine peel, and poria, and take it with thirty pills of the firming intestinal pill. However, since the firming intestinal pill is drying, there is concern that there may still be lingering qi that has not moved; therefore, it is advisable to only drink this decoction initially, and the firming intestinal pill should not be used hastily. The firming intestinal pill has the effect of removing dampness and solidifying the intestines.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If one suffers from residues after eating, or has a slight overindulgence in porridge, or is extremely hungry before eating, causing abdominal pain, there is no need to fear. One should prepare a decoction of equal parts white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel to soothe oneself. </p>
<p>For those who have experienced prolonged diarrhea and are weak and frail, leading to continuous loose stools, it is appropriate to use a purging mixture. This can include terminalia chebula, nutmeg, alum, and pinellia. In severe cases, add oyster shells as an option. However, it is essential to use dried tangerine peel as an adjunct, as severe liquefaction may also cause pain. In more critical situations, one can moxibust at the Tianshu and Qihai points.</p>
<p>The above formula uses magnolia bark to specifically eliminate stagnation and accumulated Qi. However, magnolia bark is highly warming and disperses Qi readily; prolonged use can lead to deficiency in those already weak. If stagnation still persists, utilize stir-fried Citrus aurantium and dried tangerine peel. Yet, stir-fried Citrus aurantium also consumes Qi; it is slightly slower than magnolia bark and heavier than dried tangerine peel. Once stagnation has lessened, remove it, only using dried tangerine peel to harmonize all the medicinal ingredients. Dried tangerine peel, when stripped of its white part, serves both to nourish and purge. If used as an adjunct to ginseng or atractylodes, it serves purely as a tonic.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>For dysentery and abdominal pain, one must use white peony root and licorice as the primary ingredients, with angelica and white atractylodes as assistants. For those suffering from cold and pain, cinnamon should be added; for those with heat and pain, add ameliorating coptis. If one can further consult seasonal medicines according to the year and current conditions, it will enhance the treatment, which is surely more effective than simply adhering to a fixed prescription.</p>
<p>Dysentery can present with a deficiency of qi combined with cold and heat, food accumulation, wind pathogens, heat, dampness, and sinking yang qi, so the treatment must be differentiated. For light diarrhea, treat the severe dysentery. Any accumulation with abdominal heat and gripping pain should be addressed; for issues with qi, one should examine the abdomen as if it were crabs. Ultimately, one must trace the source of the disease and match it with the appropriate medicine. The main principles are to dispel wind pathogens, move stagnated qi, and open the stomach and diaphragm first. </p>
<p>Do not hastily use nutmeg, myrobalan, or white atractylodes to supplement and suppress cold pathogens; do not use grain husks or dragon bone to close and bind damp heat in the stomach and intestines. If the pathogens are supplemented, they will grow stronger, thus the condition may worsen, leading to prolonged suffering.</p>
<p>If the treatment aims to disperse, one may use stomach wind decoction, wind-dispersing white peony root decoction, divine atractylodes powder, and other similar formulas to induce sweating. </p>
<p>For accumulating pathogens, if there is dampness, one should use guiding water pills; if there is also stagnation, one can employ descending qi decoction or harmonizing pills. If there is food accumulation, use holy cake and spleen accumulation pills; for cold accumulation, apply the prescribed warming and soothing pills. If damp heat is severe, one should use clearing and brightening ointments. </p>
<p>For diagnosis, if the color is white, it indicates a qi issue; red and white signifies a disease of qi and blood; a combination of red and black relates to damp heat; and mixed shades of green suggest wind with damp and fire.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>For those who have menstrual bleeding, cool the blood using Danggui and Shengdi. For red blood, refer to the &quot;Baoming Ji&quot; which prescribes the Four Substance Decoction with the addition of Sophora flower, Coptis, and fried millet husk with vinegar. </p>
<p>For diarrhea with weak pulse and abdominal pain, use Jiangfu Decoction, adding Duowuling and Lichong, along with the &quot;Jiyao&quot; Gengsui powder. If the diarrhea is accompanied by a greenish color, it indicates cold and wind. </p>
<p>If yang energy is descending, use Shengyang Yigei Decoction with the addition of Platycodon and vinegar-prepared Nanchang, applying Mei leaf on the eyebrows which is highly effective, as it stops the bubbles. </p>
<p>For watery diarrhea with notable dampness, the Pingwei Powder combined with Duowuling Powder works best; or alternatively, Ququn Pill may be used. </p>
<p>For elderly individuals overly cared for, diet harming the spleen results in spleen deficiency. Use the &quot;Jiyao&quot; Bai Zhu and Shao Yao Decoction, preparing the dampness with fried Xian Zhu.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>If yin and yang are not separated, one should use diuretics like Wuling and may also use a powdered form of coix seeds, combined with rice decoction at two qians. If both blood and qi are deficient and the spirit is weak, take ginseng, white atractylodes, angelica, peony, and fried poria, and add a small amount of coptis to take. The Qian’s white atractylodes powder or the Shibu decoction are also good options. If there is summer dysentery with a weakened pulse, one should use the xiangru decoction or Qing-shu Yiqi; alternatively, the Liuhe decoction or Huo-xiang Zhengqi, each with half a qian of costus added, is called the Mu-xiang Jiaojia powder. If the white dysentery has a texture like frozen glue or nasal mucus, this is considered cold dysentery, and one should use the Zhi-shi decoction with one qian of costus added. For those who are weak, also take the Shibu decoction. In cases of red dysentery with fever, prepare the Baidu powder with a pinch of Chen Cang rice. For dysentery with difficulty in urination, the Huanglian Ejiao pill is the best choice.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>On the Illness of Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>The ailment of stagnation has often been misunderstood. Some in the world divide cold and heat based on red and white, recklessly using drying agents to stop it; others claim it is due to accumulation and prescribe Ba Nao pills to attack it; or they point to damp-heat and offer diuretics to relieve it. Can such one-sided errors be overlooked? According to &quot;Yuan Bing Shi,&quot; both red and white pertain to the same principle, reiterated through various explanations, yet not fully grasped.</p>
<p>If the intestines and stomach are stagnant and not functioning, the proper remedy should be cooling and harsh medicines to promote change and wash away the stagnation, rather than using toxic and heating treatments like Ba Nao. Otherwise, the stagnation may worsen, leading to severe complications. If purging and relieving do not distinguish between symptoms, mixing the signs of damp-heat with the obstruction of urination is not the correct treatment. </p>
<p>For purging involves water and grain, symbolic of dampness. Stagnation, on the other hand, consists of waste and clots, similarly manifesting damp-heat. The treatments must be distinctly different. Gentle diuretics function to scatter and facilitate the water pathways, allowing the turbulent flow to cease naturally.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The manifestation of existence and non-existence, how can it be confused with the discussion of stagnation below, and can one apply treatments to guide stagnation and accumulation? The diarrhea originating from the pathway of the large intestine has no connection with kidney energy. The substances passed can be like fish brain, like bean juice, or consist of white pus, pure blood, red or white, or a mixture of red and white; can such cases be treated like diarrhea by using mild diuretics? One must examine its root cause, which stems from the intestines and stomach daily accumulating food and drink, the excess not being entirely expelled, remaining stagnant within, causing dampness, steaming heat, and congestion that deepens over time. When the summer heat is rampant, the fire within is commanding, and the regulation of intake goes awry, it further reacts to the intense heat toxin. As autumn arrives and the yang energy begins to decline, the heat energy decreases, leading to the evaporation of accumulated substances, and thus the symptoms of stagnation and diarrhea manifest. Because of the stagnation in accumulation, it is termed &quot;stagnation below.&quot; The damp heat and accumulated stagnation, if dry in the blood aspect, appears red; if dry in the qi aspect, appears white; thus both red and white substances can result, indicating that both qi and blood have been afflicted by evils.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>If it has not improved for a long time, the energy weakens and does not circulate, the spleen accumulates and does not process, the old accumulation becomes slippery and congealed, resembling fish brain. If severe, the intestines and stomach may be empty, the barrier is compromised, and turbid fluids flow together, differing in color and mixed as though like bean juice. If the spleen energy sinks, and one sits and strains without relief, the output may resemble white pus. If the heat damages the blood deeply and damp toxins accumulate, it may congeal into a purplish-black color. When the filth accumulates and wishes to exit but the energy is stagnated, this causes downward pressure and pain, a heavy feeling in the back, urgency to defecate yet inability to do so; this leads to frequent, minimal urges that arise suddenly, causing restlessness. All this is due to obstructions in the large intestine channel, blocking the flow of energy and fluids. Many say it is difficult to treat; what method can be sought? The discourse from Changsha states: for those that can be purged, use a formula with rhubarb; for those that can be warmed, use ginger and aconite.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>How could one ever use the fiery poison of the Ba Nao to suppress it, or use strong sour astringents to contain it? Moreover, according to the words from Hejian: when there is heaviness in the lower body, one ought to purge; when there is abdominal pain, one ought to harmonize; when the body feels heavy, one ought to warm; when the pulse is wiry, one should dispel wind; when there is thick phlegm and blood, one must use strong medicines to counter it; when the body feels cold and there is spontaneous sweating, one should use warming poisons; if wind evil causes contraction, one ought to induce sweating; if there is diarrhea, one should warm; for those on the surface, induce sweating; for those within, purge; for those above, induce vomiting; for those below, exhaust; when there is heat on the surface, clear it within; when urination is painful or difficult, benefit it by promoting urination. The distinction of heavy and light in using medicines is further detailed. If one regulates the blood, the bowels will naturally heal, and if one adjusts the qi, the heaviness in the lower body will be relieved. This is the essential discussion on treating excess and deficiency, particularly regarding great deficiency and great cold, with recorded experiences and case studies. Considering these methods, could one merely adhere rigidly to one principle? Furthermore, there are cases of weakness and inability to eat, which relates to prohibiting intake in the case of dysentery; however, there has been no detailed discussion on this in the seven methods. Applying the great principles to this, there is internal obstruction with nausea and reversal, resembling the rise of fire upwards; at the root of this is the weakness of the stomach with wood and fire overcoming, which is the earth being destroyed by wood. Recognizing this can lead to many critical conditions.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The Bureau&#39;s Insights - Zhu Zhenheng of the Yuan Dynasty</p>
<p>On the Condition of Stagnation and Diarrhea</p>
<p>Some say: The expressions from Hejian regarding stagnation seem to lack references to the cold and empty aspects, is this true or false? The response: In cases of diarrhea, the food and water may either be digested or not, without any pressing pain, merely a sense of fatigue. However, in the case of stagnation, it is different; there may be pus or blood, or a mixture of pus and blood, or fecal matter, or a lack of residue, or mixed residues. Although there are variations in pain, whether there is pain or no pain, or considerable pain, all of it results in a sense of urgent and heavy pressure that is bothersome. Upon examining the classics and observing the symptoms, it seems to indicate a pattern of heat and actual conditions. In recent years, my experiences have also encountered significant deficiency and cold, which is essential to recognize.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong><br><strong>By Luo Tianyi (Yuan Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: purulent blood is thick and sticky, all belong to fire. Taiyin governs diarrhea, and Shaoyin governs dysentery, leading to the loss of fluid through prior diarrhea. Fire causes dryness, and the kidneys dislike dryness. Residing in the lower cavity&#39;s blood area, it becomes susceptible to evil, hence the occurrence of purulent blood. However, blue and white signify cold, and red and yellow signify heat, requiring consideration of both. For treating heat, use the Solid Center Pill or Cardamom and Aromatic Mixture; for cold, use White Glue and Aromatic Powder. If there is more heat than cold, boil Wood Fragrance Paste with water. If symptoms are frequent and slippery, it is good to stop diarrhea and nourish with Zang Decoction. If the pathogenic energy has greatly receded but the righteous energy has not yet stabilized, it is necessary to provide nourishment.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding stopping diarrhea and dysentery, if the spleen and stomach are weak and unable to tolerate food, one cannot universally apply punitive medicines. If one nourishes the spleen qi, there will naturally be enough qi to take in food. The Qian family prescription, Yigong Powder, is appropriate. If one excessively craves food and injures the spleen and stomach, leading to abdominal distension and nausea, then do not stick to this principle; instead, it is advisable to use Tangerine Peel, Zhi Zhu Pill. One dose should suffice, and it should not be repeated. If food intake is regulated without causing harm, then the stomach qi will be tranquil.</p>
<p>For heat-induced diarrhea, with heat below the navel, red-yellow stools, or perhaps with intestinal debris, use Zhangjing&#39;s Huangqin Decoction. If heat toxin enters the stomach, causing bloody diarrhea, use Zhangjing’s Huanglian and Ejiao Decoction. For cold toxins resulting in diarrhea, with cold below the navel, abdominal bloating, and stools that may be yellow-white or red-black, or possibly with clear grains, use the Regulate the Center Decoction, or the Four Extremities Decoction, or the Bai Tong Decoction.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise: The Correct Transmission of Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Yu Tuan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;If there is blood and pus in the urine and feces, the flow of qi causes the blood to stop.&quot; My humble observation of the text suggests that the character for urine is missing the character for turbidity. Urine refers to urination. The mention of blood with pus in the urine indicates the cause of the disease. The blood is obstructed due to stagnation of qi, leading to difficulty in both urination and defecation. The statement that qi flows and blood stops refers to the treatment method. Therefore, Hejian elucidates this idea by stating that harmonizing qi will alleviate the heaviness in the lower body and that medications such as cardamom, betel nut, and bitter orange should be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Hejian further states: &quot;When blood circulates, the discharge of pus from the bowels is self-healing; when qi is harmonized, the heaviness in the lower body is alleviated.&quot; He also states that if there is heaviness in the lower body, purgation is indicated; if there is abdominal pain, harmonization is recommended; if the body feels heavy, dampness must be expunged; if the pulse is taut, wind must be expelled; if pus and blood are thick and sticky, potent medications should be used to force them out; if the body feels cold and there is spontaneous sweating, warming medications should be administered; if wind pathogenic factors are trapped on the outside, sweating is necessary; if there is watery diarrhea resembling dysentery, warming should be applied. He also notes: &quot;If the condition is superficial, apply acupuncture; if it is internal, use purging; for conditions above, induce vomiting; and for conditions below, deplete.&quot; If there is heat on the surface of the body, it should be cleared out; if urination is turbid, it should be separated and relieved. He states, &quot;For excess, harmonize it; for deficiency, send it away; for excess, stop it.&quot; The military strategy advises evading the sharp approach and striking when the opponent is sluggish. This encapsulates the essence of the treatment.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>In ancient practices, diarrhea and dysentery were treated with similar methods, blurring the distinctions between them. However, it is not commonly understood that diarrhea is related to the spleen while dysentery is related to the kidneys. Danxi stated: if water diarrhea occurs before purulent blood, this indicates a transfer from the spleen to the kidneys, making it difficult for the evil pathogen to retreat. If purulent blood occurs before water diarrhea, this indicates a transfer from the kidneys to the spleen, allowing for easier recovery from the mild evil. These are sayings from earlier sages, meant as guidelines for later learners. Should practitioners not investigate this in detail?</p>
<p>Zhongjing treated dysentery that could be purged by using modified Chengqi Decoction. The cold nature of rhubarb has a strong drive to move, complemented by the warmth of magnolia bark, which helps in dispersing stagnant qi. Sweetness from licorice gently eases the treatment, while decoctions help cleanse the intestines and stomach, resulting in a light, refreshing feeling that halts accumulation. </p>
<p>The formula &quot;局方&quot; employs arsenic, cinnabar, and other heavy substances to form pills; their qi is fierce, and their bodies are heavy and stagnant. Even when stagnant qi has moved, if toxic qi has not yet dispersed, it is like a violent thief wielding weapons, lurking about the halls and rooms. Even if it has the power to cure illness, could it not harm the pure qi of the intestines and stomach? For those who can tolerate warmth, ginger and aconite are used for their warming effects. The formula typically uses hot medicines as the main component and cold medicines as assistance, which is acceptable for treating clear, watery diarrhea. However, for urgent interior distress and heavy sensations, what the texts refer to as being &quot;forced down,&quot; these are all caused by excessive heat. If such hot and oppressive agents are added, what else could it be but destructive?<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty – Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery, also known as &quot;stagnant diarrhea&quot; in ancient times, arises from Qi stagnation leading to accumulation, which over time becomes dysentery. The treatment must prioritize regulating Qi, hence it is said that one cannot die from dysentery without adequate intake. Dysentery should not be judged solely by its color—red or white—but rather as a manifestation of cold or heat: if the hands and feet are warm, it indicates Yang; one should first use Job&#39;s Tears Shell Drink, with Wu Ling Powder, followed by Gan Ying Pill; if the hands and feet feel cold, it indicates Yin; warm remedies must be applied, and this differentiation must be recognized.</p>
<p>For the initial onset of dysentery, regardless of whether it is red or white, characterized by urgency with frequent urges to defecate and little produced, accompanied by a return of urgency after rising, it is advisable to use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Powder with half a qian of Mu Xiang, along with Gan Ying Pill, or Su He Xiang Pill combined with Gan Ying Pill. </p>
<p>In the case of red dysentery, with bright red blood, or resembling snake or insect shapes with fresh blood, it corresponds to heat dysentery. Use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Powder with thirty black beans, Wu Ling Powder with half a qian of Mu Xiang, and a small amount of Job&#39;s Tears, along with Huang Lian Pill or Huang Lian with Ejiao Pill, or Tea Plum Pill. If the heat is severe and these medications prove ineffective, then Bai Tou Weng Decoction should be applied.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If there is fever with dysentery, boil Baidu San and add a pinch of Chen Cang rice. If the blood appears dark like bruising, taking cold medicine and having more excretions occurring frequently indicates it should be regarded as cold dysentery. It is advisable to use LIRI Zhong Tang or Si Jun Zi Tang, adding half a qian of nutmeg and cardamom. If dysentery arises from summer heat, the patient will sweat, have a fever, feel flush, experience vomiting and nausea, have thirst and desire to drink, suffer from internal stabbing pains, and have difficulty urinating with frequent blood stasis. In this case, it is appropriate to use Xiangru Yin with one qian of Huanglian, supplemented with Wuling San adjusted with water; if ineffective, use honey water to adjust. For dysentery caused by summer heat, with severe pain and inability to eat, use half of Liuhe Tang and Huoxiang Zhengqi San, known as Muxiang Jia San. </p>
<p>For white dysentery that resembles frozen glue or nasal mucus, this is classified as cold dysentery; first, one should drink more of a damp-dispelling decoction, adding one qian of cardamom and swallowing with Gan Ying Wan, and then proceed with LIRI Zhong Tang. There are also cases where the stool appears like the color of a dehydrated plum or waxed tea; these should also use the previously mentioned white dysentery medicine. For mixed red and white dysentery, it is advisable to use Weiling Yin with a pinch of rice for decoction and swallow with Zhucheng Wan. </p>
<p>In all cases of treating dysentery, one must first eliminate accumulated stagnation.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>After several days, one can certainly use the warming methods. Regardless of whether it is a case of red or white (diarrhea), it is advisable to prepare the wood fragrance pills or wood fragrance drink, or the &quot;Real Person&#39;s Nourishing Organ Soup,&quot; or to stop medication. If white diarrhea persists severely, add cooked aconite to the nourishing soup; if red diarrhea, add a small pinch of black beans; for white diarrhea, add ten grains of dried ginger; and for red diarrhea, one can also add ten grains of yellow medicine. New cases do not require these additions; this is the way to maintain health.</p>
<p>As for forbidden food diarrhea, those who get sick immediately cannot eat, or those who cannot eat due to cold medicine or excessive medication, should not be restricted by the notion that red diarrhea cannot be treated with warm medicine. It is essential to prioritize warm eating, and it is suitable to use the middle soothing soup with half a qian of wood fragrance, or one qian of &quot;shrinking sand.&quot;</p>
<p>Resting diarrhea occurs due to premature stops in treatment, leading to stagnation, or due to recovery from diarrhea without proper care, causing intermittent symptoms. It is best to take the Four Gentleman Soup with one qian of dried tangerine peel and half a qian of wood fragrance, and swallow the retaining pills. The stagnation caused by stopping treatment has led to resting. If there is still accumulation, then use the warming medications.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Labor dysentery arises from a prolonged illness that depletes accumulated blood, leading to deficiency in the intestines and stomach, which can cause other symptoms. If there is heat in the five hearts resembling fatigue, one should use Yulian drink. Use double portions of lotus meat and white yam. After dysentery, for replenishing, it is advisable to use Four Gentlemen Decoction with an addition of one and a half qian of aged tangerine peel, which is similar to Yigong powder. For those who dislike sweetness, one can use Pingwei powder with a half qian each of ginseng and poria.</p>
<p>For various severe conditions, if there is persistent discharge of pus and blood, or if the color resembles that of a dead pig’s liver, or there is a mix of five colors in the discharge, often occurring without restraint, it resembles dysentery, commonly referred to as &quot;scraping the intestines.&quot; This indicates a general emptiness of the viscera, with the spleen’s energy on the verge of collapse, causing the intestines and stomach to descend. If dysentery medicines are administered, it would be a mistake. Liu Zhu drink should be used for stabilization, which might offer a slim chance of recovery.</p>
<p>Post-dysentery wind occurs due to deficiency following the dysentery, improper regulation, excessive activity, sexual exhaustion, or invasion of external pathogens, leading to weakness and soreness in the legs, possibly developing into wind dysentery. Use Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction with four pounds of tiger bone pills, or use Da Fang Feng Decoction, or often use fresh camphor, known colloquially as &quot;Kuson ginger,&quot; mixing one-third together to extract the juice, taken with wine, and externally using Eucommia, Achyranthes, cedar wood joints, angelica, rhizome of Nanjing star, and grass fragrant to decoct, then using the steam for washing.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>The movement of luck downward in white pertains to fire. The classic text states: &quot;Lesser Yang governs heaven; when the guest (malady) prevails greatly, the downward white stagnates in blood.&quot; The movement of luck in red and white has three types: the first pertains to fire. The classic text states: &quot;Lesser Yang governs heaven; when fire overwhelms, the people suffer from red and white fluid losses.&quot; It also says: &quot;Lesser Yang is in the spring; when fire overwhelms, the people suffer from red and white fluid losses, pain in the lower abdomen, and discharge in red and white.&quot; The treatment is with sweet and clear substances.</p>
<p>The second pertains to wind. The classic text states: &quot;When the condition of Jueyin prevails, the intestines grumble and there is diarrhea; pain occurs in the lower abdomen along with discharge in red and white.&quot; The treatment is also with sweet and clear substances.</p>
<p>The third pertains to wind and dampness. The classic text states: &quot;When the condition of Taiyang governs heaven, and the four qi are in conflict, the people suffer from discharge in red and white.&quot; </p>
<p>For the movement of luck characterized by urgency and heaviness, there are two types: the first is dampness that aids the spleen, resulting in heaviness. The classic text states: &quot;When Taiyin prevails, the lower abdomen is full, the waist feels heavy, and there is strong internal discomfort, leading to good discharge and diarrhea.&quot;</p>
<p>The second is wind attacking the weak spleen, leading to heaviness. The classic text states: &quot;Jueyin governs heaven; when wind overwhelms, the people suffer from diarrhea, water retention, and a sense of heaviness.&quot; Heaviness refers to the sensation of burdensome weight. </p>
<p>In cases of dysentery with internal wind evil causing contraction, the symptoms are incessant diarrhea, a deep and slow pulse, reverse circulation in the hands and feet, weak throat function, or the presence of sputum mixed with pus and blood, which is difficult to treat. It is advisable to use Ma Huang Sheng Ma Decoction or Xiao Xu Ming Decoction to resolve it. The principle states: &quot;With external evil constricted internally, one must disperse the evil to the limbs and distribute it through the vessels; if the external evil is eliminated, the organs will be at peace.&quot; If there is food accumulation, add five qian of Zhi Shi. If wine leads to diarrhea, this indicates heat; add five qian of Huang Qin.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Medical Texts from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 260</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery is caused by damp-heat and food accumulation. The treatment should differentiate between the five colors: red, white, blue, yellow, and black, corresponding to the five organs. The white color is associated with damp-heat, harming the Qi; red is also damp-heat, harming the blood; a mixture of red and white harms both Qi and blood; yellow is due to food accumulation. The treatment method involves expelling the damp-heat from the intestines and stomach, relieving obstructed Qi, digesting the food stagnation, and ensuring unobstructed passages.</p>
<p>Initially, only diarrhea is present. If there&#39;s no recovery after the initial treatment, adjust based on symptoms. If dysentery persists for a long time, avoid laxatives due to a deficiency in the stomach. Dysentery is mostly associated with heat, but there can also be deficient or cold types. For deficiency, tonifying methods should be used; for cold, warming methods are preferable. Elderly or weak individuals should not take laxatives.</p>
<p>The formula includes five fen (a measurement) of fried Scutellaria (Huangqin), five fen of fried Coptis (Huanglian), and two qian (another measurement) of fried White Peony (Baishao). These three herbs are essential for treating dysentery. Add five fen of fried Aquilaria (Muxiang), five fen of fried Bitter Orange (Zhike), three fen of roasted Licorice (Gancao), and one qian of Areca Nut (Binglang), boiled with ginger water for consumption. If abdominal pain increases, add one qian and five fen of Angelica (Danggui) and one qian of Sand Ginger (Shuansha), and further add five fen each of Aquilaria and White Peony.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The preceding symptoms are all due to damp-heat accumulation; if the condition worsens, this formula is advisable.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>If there is stagnation in food intake, use Erchen Decoction with hawthorn to send off the fragrant lotus pill. Master Zhongjing says: If the pulse is deep and strong, it indicates fullness in the interior, and purgation is appropriate; if the pulse is deep and weak, it indicates deficiency in the interior, and supplementation is needed. If the vital energy is deficient and slippery, it should be warmed and nourished. If the pulse is slippery and rapid, it indicates retained food, and purgation should be done. If the pulse is floating and large, this is due to deficiency yet strong purgation is required. If the pulse is floating and leathery, accompanied by intestinal sounds, it should be warmed. If there is purging diarrhea with a hardened abdomen, it should be purged. If there is purging diarrhea with delirium and dry stools, it should also be purged. In purging diarrhea, if all three pulse positions are flat, pressing it reveals hardness and urgency in the heart area, purgation should be performed. If the pulse of purging diarrhea is large, floating, and taut, it will resolve on its own. If there is purging diarrhea with fullness and pain in the abdomen indicating fullness, purgation is required. The practitioner must be diligent. </p>
<p>If there is heaviness combined with slippery symptoms, add five parts of fried talc, with five parts each of bitter orange peel, betel nut, peony, and rhizome of sweetflag. </p>
<p>Note: If there is a discharge of pus and blood, it indicates the flow of qi while the blood is stagnant. When blood flows, the discharge of pus will resolve itself; regulating qi will eliminate the heaviness. If there is stagnation in the large intestine, with fullness and heaviness, the method should be to discharge. If the qi of the large intestine is deficient and sinking, causing heaviness, the method should be to raise and supplement.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>If there is white dysentery, add one qian each of white atractylodes, white poria, talc, and roasted tangerine peel. Initially, if one wants to purge, add five qian of rhubarb. If there is food accumulation, add one qian each of hawthorn and bitter orange.</p>
<p>Note: For abdominal pain with a heavy sensation after pressing, or a strong, full pulse, this indicates stagnation and blockage; this formula is suitable for relieving it. If there is abdominal pain with a heavy sensation that is relieved by pressing, or a weak, fine pulse, this indicates deficiency of Yang Qi and cold; the formula Six Gentlemen with dried ginger should be used for warm supplementation.</p>
<p>If there is red dysentery, add one qian and five fen each of angelica, ligusticum, and peach kernel. Initially, if one wants to purge, add five qian of rhubarb.</p>
<p>Note: If the illness has lasted long, or if improper purging medicines have been taken without improvement, one should tonify the spleen and stomach. Generally, blood conditions that do not heal for a long time are often due to Yang Qi deficiency leading to an inability to generate blood, or due to deficiency of Yang Qi leading to an inability to contain blood. Hence, Mr. Danxi treated this condition, which had not improved, with the Four Gentlemen Decoction to achieve its purpose.</p>
<p>If red and white dysentery are mixed together, add one qian and five fen each of ligusticum, angelica, and peach kernel to regulate the blood, and one qian and five fen each of talc, tangerine peel, and苍朮 (a type of atractylodes) to regulate the Qi.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>If there is excess food accumulation, add hawthorn and bitter orange to aid digestion. </p>
<p>[Note: If the previous condition is due to stagnation of qi and food accumulation caused by damp heat, this remedy should be used. If there is spleen deficiency with food stagnation, it is advisable to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Xianglian Pill for supplementation. The classic states: the spleen governs blood, and the lungs govern qi. The previous condition affects both qi and blood. If it results from damage to spleen and lung blood, the Four Substance Decoction should be used with added Atractylodes and Poria, and prepared with Xianglian Pill. If it results from damage to spleen and lung qi, the Four Gentlemen Decoction should be used with added Angelica and Chuanxiong, and prepared with Xianglian Pill.]</p>
<p>If there is chronic white dysentery, with a weak stomach and qi deficiency, or if there is no recovery after a bowel movement, omit areca nut and bitter orange, reduce the doses of Scutellaria, Coptis, and Peony each by seven parts, and add 1.5qian of Atractylodes, 1qian each of Astragalus, Tangerine Peel, and Poria, and 5fen each of powdered sand and dry ginger that have been roasted.</p>
<p>[Note: If, previously, there have been frequent bowel movements with inability to pass stools, or if a small amount of white pus appears, it indicates that the earth cannot generate metal and that the lung and large intestine qi are damaged, causing downward descent. One should use Shengma Yigai Decoction to lift the yang qi, allowing the yin to descend so that the bowel movements normalize. If food cannot be ingested, with fever and thirst indicating a severe condition, use the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction; if ineffective, administer Ershen Pill.]<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>If the dysentery is prolonged, and the stomach is weak with blood deficiency, or if symptoms persist after a purge, reduce both Huangqin (Scutellaria) and Huanglian (Coptis) by five fen, and add one qian each of Danggui (Angelica), Chuanxiong (Ligusticum), Shudihuang (Rehmannia), Ejiao (Donkey-hide gelatin), and Chenpi (dried tangerine peel), along with one qian five fen of Baizhu (Atractylodes). </p>
<p><em>Note: If the initial condition indicates heat in the Spleen channel causing lasting issues, one should use Siwu Decoction with added Baizhu and Fuling (Poria). If Spleen Qi deficiency prevents the regulation of blood and does not resolve, use the Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Danggui. If Middle-Qi sinks and fails to contain blood, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction.</em></p>
<p>If there is a mixture of red and black, this indicates an excess of dampness. If urination is red, scanty, and painful, add one qian each of Mutong (Akebia), Zexie (Alisma), and Fuling, and five fen of fried Zhizhi (Gardenia fruit) to promote urination.</p>
<p><em>Note: Initially, if there is an abundance of dampness associated with red and painful urination, the previously mentioned herbs are recommended. If the condition has lasted long with Yang Qi falling or in the elderly and weak, the Sheng Yang Qu Zhi Feng Decoction is advisable. If there is a deficiency in Spleen Earth and the cold water invades, first use the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added ginger and cinnamon to warm and tonify, then follow with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Fuling and Banxia (Pinellia) for supplementary support.</em><a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>If there is dysentery with blood, add one qian each of Angelica, Chuanxiong, Rehmannia, Peach Kernel, and Szechuan Sophora flower, all stir-fried; if not cured for a long time, reduce Scutellaria and Rhu Xiang to seven fen each, remove Areca nut and Bitter Orange, then add one qian five fen of Ejiao, leaf of Platycladus, and Bai Zhu, and one qian each of dry ginger (stir-fried black) and tangerine peel.</p>
<p>(Note: In the previous symptoms, there can be those due to weakened spleen energy, those due to spleen energy sinking, those due to weak liver energy, and those due to liver blood deficiency with heat.)</p>
<p>If dysentery has lasted a long time and the heaviness doesn&#39;t cease, this indicates a sinking of the large intestine. Remove Areca nut and Bitter Orange, use Scutellaria and add one qian of Cimicifuga to lift it.</p>
<p>(Note: In the previous symptoms, there can be those due to stagnation of large intestine energy, those due to sinking of large intestine energy, those due to deficiency of large intestine blood, and those due to cold deficiency of spleen and kidney. If there is stagnation of the large intestine causing sinking, use the Four Gentlemen Formula in conjunction with Xianglian Pill. If there is sinking due to deficiency of large intestine energy, use the Four Gentlemen Formula with Chai Hu and Cimicifuga to send it with Xianglian Pill. If there is blood deficiency causing heaviness, use the Four Herbs Decoction with Ginseng and Bai Zhu along with Xianglian Pill. Dongyuan states: If there is urgency inside, it means the abdomen is not relaxed. There are also those who sit idly with difficulty in defecation, all these indicate blood deficiency.)<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>If there is a deficiency of blood, there will be urgency in the bowels and heaviness in the rear. If there is vomiting and food cannot be ingested, add 1.5 grams of soft gypsum, 1 gram of dried tangerine peel, 0.5 grams of fried gardenia fruit, and 0.6 grams of fresh ginger, and slowly sip to relieve the heat in the stomach. </p>
<p>Note: If the previous symptoms stem from a longstanding damp-heat in the spleen and stomach, or from overeating rich, spicy foods that caused sudden illness, this prescription is suitable. If the stomach qi is deficient and there is counterflow of qi leading to vomiting, use Liu Jun Zi Tang with added fresh ginger. If the stomach qi is deficient and cold, also use the above medicine with added fried ginger and costus. </p>
<p>For cases of both qi and blood deficiency accompanied by dysentery, use Si Wu Tang with additional ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, baicalein, and coptis. </p>
<p>Note: If the previous symptoms indicate that the spleen qi is deficient and the blood is weak, Si Jun Zi Tang is advisable. If the stomach qi is deficient and the blood is weak, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. For long-term illness with both qi and blood deficiency, Ba Zhen Tang is recommended. Generally, if this condition does not improve over time or transforms into various symptoms, consistently adhering to the previous methods will eventually lead to recovery. </p>
<p>In cases of cold dysentery, use coptis, costus, peony, wine-fried angelica, fried dried ginger, sand, magnolia bark, and cinnamon.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>According to Master Dongyuan, if the pulse is deep and thin, the body does not move, the eyes cannot see well, food and drink do not go down, and the breath from the nose is weak, then use Ginger-Enhancing Decoction. If the body feels heavy and the limbs cannot lift, use Atractylodes-Enhancing Decoction. If there is sudden, silent diarrhea, the body is cold and sweating, urination is free, but there is no control over bowel movements, breath is difficult, the pulse is weak, and there is vomiting, then use the Water Decoction. </p>
<p>If one suffers from dysentery and mistakenly takes warm or hot drugs to stop diarrhea, even if it has lasted some time, it is appropriate to use the previous methods and follow the prescriptions below to adjust. If dysentery occurs and the previous methods for expelling it do not work, and the previous adjustment methods have been used for a long time without improvement, this indicates a deficiency of cold and slippery nature. Therefore, one can choose from the previously mentioned methods to tonify and warm, adding dragon bone, talc, poppy husk, and black plum flesh to stop diarrhea.</p>
<p>If the previous condition shows that the spleen&#39;s qi is deficient and cold, and abandons downward force, one should use the Beneficial Middle, Energy-Enhancing Decoction, such as with corn husk, ginger, and cinnamon. If it does not respond, urgently use Aconite. If qi and blood are weak, use the Complete Great Tonifying Decoction, adding Aconite and corn husk. If the fire at the life gate is declining, use Eight-Flavor Pill to tonify the Earth Mother. If abdominal pain causes thirst for soup, and pressing the abdomen brings slight relief, then warm tonification of the spleen and stomach is advisable.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>If there is fever, thirst, dark and urgent urination, and painful and red stools, it is due to heat. If the body is cool and not thirsty, with clear urination and smooth, white stools, it is due to cold. However, dysentery is often caused by summer heat, while colder cases are less common. Nonetheless, due to the changes between yin and yang, if the color is red but light, it may also indicate cold; if it is white but thick, it may indicate heat. One must consider both the color and symptoms to distinguish between cold and heat. </p>
<p>Blood is affected by fire, and excess dampness can cause diarrhea. When fire injures the qi aspect, it leads to qi stagnation, resulting in white stools from the lower intestines; when fire injures the blood aspect, it causes blood stasis, leading to red stools from the small intestine. If both qi and blood are harmed, there will be a combination of red and white symptoms. The causes may include external factors of summer heat and dampness, internal injuries from alcoholic intake, excessive cooking or roasting, or emotional stress leading to tangible fire situations. </p>
<p>There may also be external factors of cold and dampness, internal injuries from cold substances, physical blockage of hard materials, or excessive sexual activity harming essence and blood, resulting in an empty fire state. All of these can lead to dampness and stagnation in the intestines, accumulating and forming toxins over time. The classics state: irregular diet and untimely rest lead to obstruction in the five organs through yin, resulting in diarrhea and intestinal issues. This indicates that damp heat is stagnant in the intestines, hence termed stagnation downward. Furthermore, it is stated that dysentery refers to diarrhea, thus it should be treated with purgation. Initially, one may experience fever, aversion to cold, headache, and body aches, which represent exterior symptoms.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>For those with heat, use the Nine-Flavor Qiang Huo Decoction; for those with cold, the Jin Zheng Qi Powder should not be exchanged. For vexation and thirst caused by heat, use the Ru Ling Decoction, Liu Yi Powder, or Mei Mi Drink. For deficiency, use the Qian Family White Atractylodes Powder. For vomiting with both cold and heat, it belongs to the half exterior; use the Chai Ling Decoction. For stubborn phlegm in the diaphragm, use the Qin Lian Er Chen Decoction with added Fang Feng and Jie Geng to expel phlegm. For stomach fire ascending, use the Qing Liu Wan. For toxin stagnating and ascending, use the Ping Wei Powder with added Huang Lian, Mu Xiang, and Bing Lang. For deficient vomiting with little food intake, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction, adding Chen Pi, Hou Po, Mai Men Dong, and Zhu Ru, or Warm Liu Wan. For those with chronic yin deficiency, use the Eight Ingredients combined with Er Chen Decoction and add Jie Geng. </p>
<p>In the case of complete inability to eat, known as &quot;mouth shut,&quot; it indicates severe stomach fire. For severe weakness and heat, make a powder of half Xiang Lian Wan and half lotus seeds, and take with rice drink. Alternatively, use four qian of ginseng and two qian of roasted Huang Lian, decocted and sipped all day long. If vomiting occurs again, take it again. Just one sip and it will open up the throat. For those poisoned and affecting the heart and lungs, use the Bai Du San with lotus seeds and aged rice or simply use lotus seeds, ground into powder; with every two qian of Chen Pi, decoct and drink. Externally, take a large field snail, mix in a little musk, crush it and apply it to the navel, then paste with Tai Yi ointment to draw down the heat. In cases of overconsumption of purgatives and spleen-stomach deficiency, use the Ren Ling Bai Atractylodes Powder, removing Shan Yao and adding Chang Pu.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Urgent Abdominal Pain with Heaviness in the Rectum</strong></p>
<p>Fire moves quickly downward, sometimes dissolving or not dissolving. When food stagnates and desires to exit, the qi instead becomes trapped, leading to the urge to defecate without success, causing abdominal pain that is urgent and constricted, and a feeling of heaviness and dragging in the lower intestines. In severe cases, there may be pain at the anus. One should use musk and areca nut to help move qi, rhubarb to descend fire, Scutellaria and Coptis to resolve toxicity, and Angelica and peony to harmonize the blood, while bitter orange and aged tangerine peel help to move stagnation. The classic states: &quot;Harmonizing the blood allows pus to heal on its own, and moving qi helps alleviate heaviness in the rectum.&quot; If there is an underlying virtual fire, ginseng, atractylodes, angelica, and chuanxiong should be used to nourish it; if there is cold congealing, dried ginger and cinnamon should be used to warm it. Additionally, if there are existing accumulations, it is crucial to discern which organ’s qi is not functioning, potentially leading to dysentery due to disturbance of the intestines and stomach, in order to address it appropriately.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>Differentiating the Five Colors</strong></p>
<p>A pure red that is excessively hot indicates summer heat; for mild cases, use Huangqin Decoction, and for severe cases, use Daoshi Decoction. If it persists, use Huanglian Ejiao Decoction. A hot accumulation with purple-black color suggests blood stasis. For unusual abdominal pain and a feeling of heaviness afterward, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction. If due to mistakenly using heat treatment causing blood stasis, use Xijiao Dihuang Decoction with added Huanglian and Dahuang, or Jiawei Qingliu Pills; for long-standing cases, use Dihu San, Dankushen Pills, or Huanglian Ejiao Pills. It is important to note that all dysentery involves blood stasis, and only black indicates severe stasis. </p>
<p>Cold dysentery appears white like duck droppings, with intestinal sounds and slight pain or descent; use Weichang Zhengqi Powder, adding Wumei, Chenmi, or cooked Liujisan. If the limbs are cold and the stool is clear, use G姜 Fu Decoction or Lizhong Decoction. For long-standing cases, use Huanglian Bujung Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of damp dysentery accompanied by abdominal distension and a heavy body feeling, with liquid resembling bean juice or mixed red-black and turbid colors, it is a dangerous condition. Use Danggui Huo Xue San, Shengyang Chushi Fang, Shengyang Yigui Tang, Chushi Tang, Zhuling Decoction, or Wujidan Pills. </p>
<p>For wind dysentery with aversion to wind, nasal congestion, body aches, presenting as blue or pure blue watery stool, use Gancang Fang or Shenzhusan. If the color is blue with white, it indicates wind-cold; use Wujisan; if it has red, use Weifeng Decoction. For mixed blue-green colors, this pertains to wind-fire-dampness, and if all five colors are present, it signifies food accumulation in the spleen and stomach, along with the conjunction of the four energies; use Gu Yulian Pills to remedy this. </p>
<p>The aforementioned external-causation dysentery resembles epidemic dysentery in similarity among young and old and is named epidemic dysentery. Use Baidu San plus Chenpi or ginger tea decoction for prevention, further adjusting treatment based on qi movement. <a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p>
<h3>Examination of Seven Emotions</h3>
<p>For the condition of qi dysentery, with symptoms resembling crab foam, marked urgency, and flowing qi, prescribe the following: Qi drink for children, ancient dried tangerine peel pills, and Six Mashing Decoction. If there is heat, use Detoxifying Decoction with added Zhimu and Zhike, or the pill of Mu Xiang and Betel Nut. If the condition is cold, use Mu Xiang Harmonizing Qi Powder or Boiled Yellow Pill. For urinary retention, prescribe Wu Ling Powder. If the condition persists, use Qi Dysentery Pills.</p>
<p>In cases of accumulated dysentery presenting with yellow or fish soup-like color, abdominal swelling, pain, and aversion to food, consider Bai Pian Pills or Emergency Pain Relief Pills. For all types of food stagnation, whether yellow or red, use Tong Yuan Er Ba Dan. If there is severe injury from alcohol, use Huang Lian Pills for alcohol-induced symptoms. For water retention causing distension and pain in the flanks and abdomen, apply Warm Six Pills. If the body is solid, use Water Guide Pills.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p>
<h3>Hypochondria</h3>
<p>Hypochondria manifests as weakness, chronic diarrhea and exhaustion, difficulty digesting food, slight or severe abdominal pain without straining. The blood appears deficient and pale red, treated with the two medicines of Tongyuan and Dan. Over time, add Shengma and Xiangfu to the Four Substances Decoction. If sexual exhaustion has harmed the essence and blood, causing toxicity, use Shenqi Pills. For consumption accompanied by diarrhea, use Xianglian Zhuduan Pills. In cases where diarrhea persists and pain does not diminish, especially with a tendency to sit and strain for a long time without recovery, this is a sign of deficient yin and blood. For wind in the stomach, remove cinnamon from Weifeng Decoction and add roasted land root. </p>
<p>If there is qi deficiency with a pale complexion, resembling frozen mucus, use Four Gentlemen Decoction or Lizhong Decoction, both with additions of Mu Xiang, Rou Gui, Hou Po, and Fu Ling to dispel wind evil, regulate the water pathways, and stimulate the appetite. For prolonged cases, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. If deficiency is severe with reverse cold and weak pulse, apply Sishun Powder or Heixi Dan. </p>
<p>If there is uncontrollable diarrhea, leading to possible prolapse of the rectum, address the blood aspect with Four Substances Decoction plus Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Di Yu, and Chuan Bai Pi; for the qi aspect, use Zhenren Yangzang Decoction, Daduan Pills, or Lingsha Cangyu Decoction.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Resting</strong></p>
<p>If dysentery persists for an extended period with no improvement, and there has been previous intake of cooling medicines resulting in deficiency of energy and blood, one should use Ba Wu Decoction combined with Chen Pi, Ejiao, Poria, and a little bit of Lian, or take the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. For those with spleen and stomach deficiency, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction or Ren Shen Ling Bai Zhu San. For kidney deficiency, Si Shen Wan or Chi Shi Zhi Wan are recommended. If there has been accidental ingestion of bitter medicines and residual toxins remain, utilize Guo Qian Zhu Decoction, Shen Xiao Wan, or Liu Shen Wan. If there is accumulation of substances, Tong Yuan Er Ba Dan should be applied. After detoxifying the accumulated substances, once the spleen and stomach are harmonized and energy and blood are recovering, then use Bai Zhong San to stop it. If bitter medicines are taken too early, it may lead to chronic gastric failure, which is difficult to remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Parasite Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>In cases of dysentery caused by parasites, if the stools are as dark as chicken liver, accompanied by thirst and sharp pain in the internal organs, one should take Wu Shi Tang Wan to forcefully eliminate the true yin; its blood will come from the hundred channels and meridians, so Xi Gen Wan can save it. There are also those suited for warm and hot medicines. </p>
<p>For long-standing dysentery with an anus resembling a bamboo tube or stools that look like leaky, moldy water, and if there is shortness of breath (food stagnation) and reversal of qi, it should not be treated. If there is purely blood in the stool, with difficulty urinating, a red lip, and a strong, rushing pulse after bowel movements, it should also not be treated.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>The general principle involves understanding common symptoms. Sweating and purging are also considered part of this approach. Initially, if the original energy is strong, treatment can proceed. However, if after five to seven days the spleen and stomach are weak, one should focus on harmonizing and resolving issues, promoting urination, and eliminating food stagnation, as there can be no dysentery without accumulation.</p>
<p>If the condition persists, medicines that invigorate Qi and blood may be added, such as Angelica, Bupleurum, Ledebouriella, and Atractylodes to elevate the energy. If symptoms are severe, one may use buckwheat husk, nutmeg, dragon bone, oyster shell, and chebula to consolidate and constrict. For those with reduced appetite, it is essential to specially adjust the spleen and stomach, as advancing food intake allows for natural harmonization of Qi and blood, since dysentery fundamentally relies on stomach Qi.</p>
<p>If there is urgency with abdominal pain but no exterior signs, one should facilitate bowel movement. For a weak spleen that resists purging, one may either harmonize or directly uplift. If Qi sinks and symptoms resemble severe diarrhea, one should temporarily stop purging. If there is severe pain with slippery discharge, it indicates excess phlegm and heat, which should be treated with purging or uplifting methods. If phlegm is dissipated and heat is lowered, the large intestine will naturally consolidate; medical decisions should be based on pulse diagnostics.</p>
<h3>After Recovery</h3>
<p>After recovering from dysentery, treatments such as Sanbai Decoction, Liushen Pills, Zhi Zhuru Pills, and Taihe Soup are recommended. If there is swelling in the hands and feet or pain in the joints, it indicates residual blood stasis in the meridians, so purely using wind-dispelling remedies is not advisable. For cases resembling &quot;crane knee wind,&quot; one may use Dahuangfeng Decoction or Wujijiaojia San; for slender legs, Canggui Pills may be prescribed.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p>
<h3>Differentiating Similarities</h3>
<p>Similar to dysentery but not dysentery, there are symptoms of imbalance between cold and heat. Sometimes heat accumulates internally and is counteracted with cold substances and remedies, or cold accumulates internally and is countered with heat medicines and foods, leading to diarrhea caused by the clash of heat and cold. Whether it is dry or loose stools, with urgency and heaviness in the abdomen, the treatments include Wujici Pills or Xianglian Pills, or Lizhong Decoction with added Huanglian and Muxiang.</p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>I perceive that dysentery often originates from issues with the spleen and kidneys. The spleen manages storage, and earth is the mother of all things; the kidneys govern storage, and water is the source of all things. Both organs are fundamental, and if treatment is insufficient, it leads to a deepening of the ailment. The root of the error lies in the unclear distinction between cold and heat, and between deficiency and excess. In recent discussions, there has been little to elaborate on, even in the works of ancient masters, which exhibit considerable bias. For instance, the &quot;Jufang&quot; and Fuan favor pungent and hot treatments, while Hejian and Danxi prefer bitter and cold remedies, showing a rigid adherence rather than a rounded understanding—how vastly different this is! Dysentery arises in the summer and autumn, associated with the heat of the season; seeking coolness leads to the excessive consumption of raw and cold items, which is due to human behavior. When one’s vitality is strong, it primarily results in heat accumulation from climatic factors; when weak, it results in excess cold caused by personal factors. The damp earth thrives in all seasons; if it derives from fire, there is an abundance of yang earth leading to damp heat as a disease, referred to as “Dunfu” in the classics. If it derives from water, there is a deficiency in yin earth leading to cold damp as a disease, referred to as “Bijian” in the classics.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>To speak of heat is to dismiss cold; to speak of cold is to neglect heat. Is this not an error in expression? Furthermore, to equate red with heat and white with cold is also not a definitive assertion. If red and white are both present, can it be said that they truly suffer from the same conditions of cold and heat? One must differentiate between them using evidence and the observation of color and pulse, and only then can cold and heat be clearly understood. It is essential to know that cold must be associated with deficiency, while heat must be associated with fullness. By detailing this deficiency and fullness, the distinction between cold and heat becomes clearer. A feeling of fullness, aversion to food, urgent pain, and fear of pressure indicate fullness; thirst that prompts drinking, a preference for coolness, and aversion to heat indicate heat. A strong and firm pulse indicates fullness; a rapid and slippery pulse indicates heat. Beyond this, everything else is surely cold and deficient. In cases of similarity, one should be particularly careful in observation. For instance, if one interprets thirst as a sign of true heat, they might not realize that in cases of diarrhea, there is a loss of bodily fluids; as fluids are depleted below, dryness occurs above. How can one not feel thirsty? Furthermore, one must differentiate between a preference for coolness and a preference for heat to understand deficiency and fullness. To consider abdominal pain as true heat might seem plausible, yet one may be unaware that dysentery originates from the organs, harming the intestines and stomach, with pus and blood pressing against the skin. How can there be no pain? One must further distinguish between the severity or urgency of the pain, whether pressure alleviates or exacerbates it, the yin and yang of the organs, the presence or absence of abdominal distension, and the strength or weakness of the pulse to ascertain deficiency and fullness.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>The yellowish-red color and the short quantity of urine indicate actual heat; however, one should understand that if fluid is lost through dysentery, urination must be lessened. When yin is depleted, the color changes. It is also essential to differentiate between the heat or lack of heat in the urine, the depletion or not of fluids, and the luster or lack thereof in color to discern between deficiency and excess. </p>
<p>The urgency and heaviness in the abdomen indicate actual heat; nevertheless, if the qi is suppressed, then the storehouse cannot hold, and if yin is lost, then the gates do not close. It is also necessary to differentiate between the new or chronic nature of the disease, the strength or weakness of the condition, and the vigor or decline of the pulse to discern between deficiency and excess.</p>
<p>In treatment, one must identify what pathogen has caused the damage and which organ is affected. If it is due to damp-heat, remove the damp-heat; if due to accumulation and stagnation, remove the accumulation; if related to qi and blood, harmonize them. New illnesses that are strong can be treated with common methods, while chronic illnesses that are deficient require different approaches. </p>
<p>These are all standard methods and need no further explanation. It is particularly puzzling that among those suffering dysentery, nineteen out of ten have a deficiency, yet physicians treating dysentery rarely provide any supplementation. If the qi is inherently sinking and one continues to move the qi, does not the heaviness worsen? If the center is fundamentally deficient and weak, does attacking the accumulation not deplete the vital energy even further? </p>
<p>When damp-heat injures the blood, one should naturally regulate the blood. If one pushes too hard, does it not further injure the blood? When fluids are exhausted, leading to thirst, one should stop the diarrhea.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>If we continue with infiltration of profits, will the essence not be wasted? The common practitioners of this world adhere strictly to the pain without remedy, claiming: &quot;Only when the pain stops can one seek to remedy it.&quot; They do not know that pain caused by emptiness only worsens with more attacks, leading to greater emptiness and pain. This stems from a lack of clarity on fundamental and peripheral issues; they only regard present ailments as tangible diseases, neglecting the intangible concerns of vital energy. </p>
<p>Let me state the necessary proofs for supplementation: a weak pulse can be supplemented; a frail appearance can be supplemented; post-disease diarrhea can be supplemented; severe cases arising from excessive interventions can be supplemented. However, what is most crucial lies within the spleen and kidney organs. If diarrhea occurs before dysentery, the spleen contributes to the kidney, leading to malevolent influences, which are hard to treat; if dysentery precedes diarrhea, the kidney transmits minor issues to the spleen, which are easier to heal. Therefore, diseases in the spleen are superficial, while those in the kidney are deep. The kidney is the gate of the stomach, opening to the two yin regions; there has never been a case of prolonged dysentery without harming the kidney. Thus, treating dysentery without supplementing the kidney is not a proper treatment. </p>
<p>All the Four Gentlemen (Si Jun Zi), Gui Pi, Shi Quan, and Bu Zhong formulas supplement spleen deficiency and are indeed beneficial. However, if the disease arises from diminished fire and the earth lacks a mother, unless we use cinnamon or aconite to significantly replenish the kidney yang and restore the spleen&#39;s maternal role, how can nourishment be received, how can the pathways be secured, and how can true essence be restored? If one fears heat and does not advance, merely supplementing the earth with ginseng and atractylodes can lead to grave consequences and significant harm.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For old accumulations, these are caused by dampness, heat, and phlegm, and the treatment should be to purge them. For new accumulations, after purging, there may be further issues, so they should be adjusted or supplemented and not treated too aggressively. If diarrhea arises from a deficiency, even old accumulations should not be purged, but rather treated with a specific dispersing medicine; once the deficiency is resolved, the diarrhea will stop. Danxi suggested first supplementing stomach Qi with ginseng and atractylodes before purging, which is also an excellent method for those in a deficient state. </p>
<p>If the stool is dark and black, it indicates extreme heat that transforms and overwhelms itself; use Shao Yao Decoction. If the stool looks like black lacquer, it indicates blood stasis; use Tao Ren Cheng Qi Decoction. If urgent bowel movements are accompanied by inability to pass stool, it indicates fire; use Cheng Qi Decoction for severe cases and Shao Yao Decoction for milder cases. If there are frequent urgent bowel movements that soil clothing, it indicates deficiency; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, removing the angelica and adding meat fruit. </p>
<p>If urgency is followed by a heavy sensation, with a slight decrease in urgency after passing stool but soon becoming severe again, use Shao Yao Decoction. If urgency is accompanied by a slippery sensation afterward, and there is no relief post-defecation because of resolving a deficiency, use Zhen Ren Yang Zang Decoction. If the heaviness persists, use licorice to alleviate it and angelica to lift it. </p>
<p>For someone who is weak, straining without producing a bowel movement, it is due to blood deficiency causing urgency; herbs like Gui Shen, Di Huang, Shao Yao, and Chen Pi should be used. If the mouth remains shut and food cannot be ingested, it results in vomiting as soon as it reaches the mouth.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>If there are evils in the upper diaphragm causing fire qi to rise, use Huanglian, Muxiang, Jiegeng, Juhong, Fuling, and Changpu; for those with stomach deficiency and vomiting, use Treating the Middle Decoction; if there is insufficient Yang qi with undigested food, use the Regulating the Middle Decoction with added Sharen, Chenpi, Muxiang, and Doukou; if there is liver qi causing vomiting, use Muxiang, Huanglian, Wuzhuyu, Qingpi, and Shaoyao; if there is water accumulation, use Wuling Powder for light cases, or add Gansui for heavier cases; if there are accumulated waste and foul qi causing dampness, use Chengqi Decoction with Shilian ground into powder, mixed with cooled rice soup. Shilian refers to aged lotus seeds; do not use the wooden lotus available in the market. Danxi used Ren Shen and Huanglian boiled strong with ginger juice, sip slowly; if there is a desire to vomit again, continue to take it, ensuring each sip is swallowed to open up the situation.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>Repeatedly stopping and starting, persisting without recovery is called &quot;rest.&quot; It is often due to an early onset of dampness, with accumulated heat not yet cleared. Use Xianglian pill supplemented with ginseng powder, licorice, poria, and bitter orange. For those with improper regulation, treat according to the symptoms. For severe deficiencies with slippery conditions, take the white bark of the chuan tree. Soak it in water for a day, remove the yellow skin, and for every two parts, add one part of ginseng, two qian of fragrant wood, and three qian of polished rice to brew a soup for drinking, or alternatively, use a big purging pill.</p>
<p>Abdominal pain caused by the lung&#39;s metal energy stagnating in the large intestine should be treated with platycodon, using white peony, licorice, dried tangerine peel, fragrant wood, and angelica as the main ingredients. Add dried ginger for aversion to cold and huanglian for aversion to heat.</p>
<p>Pain in the anus indicates heat retained below, and it is advisable to use sophora flower and fragrant wood. If accompanied by cold, use the &quot;Regulate the Center Decoction.&quot; Pinworm dysentery involves the pinworm, which is very thin, one of the nine worms. When the stomach is weak and the intestines are empty, pinworms can take advantage, causing itching or passing through the anal canal. Internally, use realgar, and take peach kernel, sophora seeds, and wormseed.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Death Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>If there is pure blood below, then death. If there is leaking water in the house, then death. If there is a large hole like a bamboo tube, then death. If the lips are like they are painted red, then death. If there is continuous fever, then death. If the color is like fish brain or pig liver, they are half dead, half alive. If the pulse is fine, the skin cold, the qi is deficient, and there is inability to eat before and after, this is called the five deficiences, leading to death. Only with ginseng and aconite, can one save one in ten.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Indicators</strong></p>
<p>A pulse that is faint and thin is auspicious. A pulse that is strong, large, slippery, and rapid is inauspicious. Zhongjing says: if the pulse is deep and stiff, it is serious. A large pulse indicates it has not yet stopped. A weak pulse indicates it wants to stop, even if there is a fever, it will not lead to death.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Stagnation and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, red was considered hot, and white cold. Liu Hejian and Li Dongyuan first disputed this. Liu claimed that all forms of dysentery arise from heat, associating red with the heart&#39;s fire, yellow with the spleen&#39;s earth, white with the lung&#39;s metal, green with the liver&#39;s wood, and black as the extreme of heat, also converging with the kidney&#39;s water transformation. All forms of diarrhea are intertwined with warmth, and dampness leads to a sensation of fullness, causing qi to be unable to circulate freely. Excessive damp heat within the intestines and stomach results in a dryness of these organs, leading to frequent urges to defecate along with a feeling of heaviness, and red, painful urination. He indicated that to treat all types of dysentery, bitter cold medicines should be used, possibly with a slight addition of a warming element. Bitterness can dry dampness, while cold can suppress heat, allowing for the smooth circulation of qi. If blood flows properly, rectal bleeding will self-heal; regulating qi will alleviate feelings of heaviness. </p>
<p>Li&#39;s approach, starting from spleen and stomach conditions, stated that upward disturbances in the lungs present as white, while downward transmissions to the yin manifest as red. The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; asserts that the Taiyin governs diarrhea, which presents in the Shaoyin as dysentery. This occurs as a result of the loss of bodily fluids and subsequent heat leading to dryness. The kidneys dislike dryness, residing in the lower abdominal blood division, thus leading to pus and blood in the stool for those affected. Nevertheless, red and yellow indicate heat, while green and white signify cold. Danxi said that dysentery from stagnation is due to the heat pressing down, causing the sensation of fullness and heaviness. Therefore, one should use Liu&#39;s methods for treating damp heat and Li&#39;s for preserving the spleen’s earth, further assessing the balance of qi and blood to determine the appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The three schools all express what previous generations have not, and they highlight the essentials. I have often studied this. From the perspective that the five colors correspond to the five organs, one can see that within the dampness and heat, five evils are intertwined. From the viewpoint of the rising and descending flow of qi and blood, one can observe that the qi and blood of the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians can all be harmed, resulting in both red and white dysentery. From the perspective of dampness and heat as a disease, it is clear that the causes of dampness and heat are not singular. From the differentiation of dysentery into deficiency and excess, one can see that all symptoms among patients with dysentery, such as restlessness, dry throat, black tongue, belching, heaviness in the back, abdominal pain, bloating, as well as foot pain, swelling, and weakness, have distinctions between deficiency and excess. Therefore, I conclude that dysentery arises from evil entering the stomach to create dampness and heat; when qi is harmed, it causes illness in the lungs; when blood is harmed, it is transmitted to the heart. The heart and lungs are the masters of blood and qi. Once the pathways of blood and qi are affected, how can they not return to the organs they govern? The large and small intestines are related to the heart and lungs, being the officials in charge of the intake and distribution of food and fluids. The stomach is the chief of the large and small intestines, and it is also the sea that contains the qi of the five organs and six bowels as well as the twelve meridians. If there are external and internal evils that harm the organs and meridians, or if the evil moves to the stomach, which belongs to the transformation of damp earth, then when the stomach suffers from the evil, the dampness cannot be transformed, accumulating and resulting in damp heat.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>When diseases of the heart and lungs transfer to the intestines, if only the large intestine suffers, the qi becomes concentrated and forms white dysentery; if only the small intestine suffers, the blood becomes concentrated and forms red dysentery; if both the large and small intestines are affected, red and white mix and are expelled together. The damp heat of the stomach that corrupts the large and small intestines also follows this pattern, with a yellow color. If the color is black, there are two types: one is a scorched black, which is black caused by extreme heat combined with water transformation; the other is a glossy black like lacquer, which represents stagnant blood. </p>
<p>Some say: Treating dysentery begins in the intestines and stomach, which is the commonly held practice; now, if we seek the initial pathogens and the channels they entered, what is the use? It is said: The disease in the intestines and stomach is the manifestation. The pathogens encountered and the channels first affected are the root cause. Furthermore, the Inner Canon indicates that for treating root and branch, there are appropriate methods for each, and the order of application matters. Additionally, the methods for transferring and changing conditions are not different from those for treating febrile diseases; how can one not pursue this? </p>
<p>Is it just this? As for diseases arising from the intestines and stomach, they should also be analyzed based on the balance of pathogenic and righteous qi. Either the righteous qi is initially deficient, allowing the invasion of pathogens, or it becomes deficient due to the pathogens; thus, the former is the root cause, and the latter is the manifestation, akin to the distinction between old and new accumulations. Old accumulations are formed from retained food and phlegm, while new accumulations arise after the old are eliminated and result from stagnation of qi and blood. Old accumulations should be treated first through elimination, while new accumulations should not be purged.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>What is the reason for this? It is because the digestion of water and grains in the intestines and stomach, along with the transportation of waste, all depend on the function of the spleen and stomach. Now, if there is an evil presence in the intestines and stomach, the spleen and stomach cannot operate freely, leading to obstruction, and so the defensive qi becomes stagnant and cannot circulate, while the nourishing blood weeps and cannot move. Consequently, phlegm accumulates in the stomach, waste remains in the intestines, and together with the stagnant qi and weeping blood, this results in a blockage that causes illness. In such cases, one must expel the blockage to ensure the smooth functioning of the spleen and stomach. If the ascending and descending processes still do not function, the defensive qi becomes stagnant again, and the nourishing blood weeps again, creating new accumulation, thus the illness returns. In this situation, it is unnecessary to seek out the evil to treat it; rather, one should regulate the defensive qi to open the pores, harmonize the nourishing blood to adjust the balance of yin and yang. When yin and yang are balanced and the pores are open, the pathways of ascending and descending will function, and the accumulation will dissipate on its own. However, there are certain accumulations that must not be purged. Initially, due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, they cannot transform and transport the food accumulations, so one must first replenish the spleen and stomach, ensuring that the true qi within them is full, and then one can purge it, so as to avoid any errors. I have often encountered popular methods that adhere to a limited number of prescriptions for treating dysentery, mainly relying on purging. But how can one know that the medicines used to attack the illness are all those that drain qi and damage blood? If used continuously, they can even lead to the scattering of qi and loss of blood, leaving the five zang organs empty, and the essence depleted, resulting in the spirit departing and death. Such closing and stagnation will only increase the qi stagnation and weeping blood problems, leading to abdominal distention, lower limb swelling, and coughs, among other ailments. The methods of dealing with illnesses in this world are hardly worth adhering to!<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Danxi stated: For conditions that can be treated by Zhang Jing’s methods, one should use the Chengqi Decoction. The cold nature of Da Huang is good for moving, while the warm nature of Hou Po is effective for promoting the smooth movement of stagnant qi. The sweetness of Gan Cao softens the mixture. When administered with warm liquid, it cleanses and nourishes the intestines and stomach, making them light and agile, thus stopping the accumulation. One should avoid the use of toxic substances such as arsenic, vermillion, Ba, and Nao, as their aggressive poison may harm the pure qi of the intestines and stomach. Furthermore, it is said that “in the prescriptions, hot medicines are primarily used, while cold medicines are supplementary.&quot; This may be acceptable for treating clear dysentery, but when there are urgent symptoms with heaviness after defecation, these conditions are all related to heat. Adding cold and hot medicines would only exacerbate the condition. The preceding discussion focuses on the treatment of cold, arguing that dysentery arises in autumn due to the accumulation of summer heat, which is quite reasonable, and the arguments are also balanced.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>It is not clear what specifically causes the oppressive heat; it often arises from intense summer heat, excessive consumption of ice water, or overindulgence in cold foods, leading to heat being trapped by cold. If these conditions persist, they may result in a lingering accumulation of cold. One must not rigidly classify it as heat without discerning the conditions through pulse diagnosis; only then can one confirm the presence of heat accumulation and consider the use of Da Huang (rhubarb). If it is a cold accumulation, using Da Huang will not only fail to alleviate the condition but may also exacerbate the pain and create a crisis.</p>
<p>Generally, for heat dysentery, Da Huang is used; for cold dysentery, Ba Dou (cascara) is employed. It is imperative to use the correct medicine for the specific illness. The methods established by ancient practitioners must be adhered to without deviation. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; outlines two essential approaches: one involves steaming Da Huang with wine, and the other involves wax pills of Ba Dou, with clear distinctions that must not be overlooked. It is also said that warming herbs may be acceptable for clear, watery dysentery, but must not be used for pure blood dysentery. Furthermore, Wang Haizang noted that during the hot months, one should avoid Huang Lian (coptis) as there is an underlying deficiency.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>The &quot;Ben Cao Yan Yi&quot; states: There was a man who, during the hot months, suffered from blood dysentery. The doctor treated him with cooling medicines, specifically using Huang Lian, Mu Xiang, and Ejiao. If this illness is addressed early, it can be treated, but if it has persisted for a long time, leading to an empty intestine, it is not appropriate to take such medicines. After more than ten days, he nearly reached a critical state and required a different treatment. This discussion can also be found in the preface of &quot;Lui Zheng Ben Cao.&quot; Haicang says: Master Yang, after three bouts of heavy drunkenness, woke up feeling extremely thirsty and drank three large cups of cold water. The next day, he drank three bowls of tea, but subsequently experienced fresh blood in his stool four times, enough to fill a basin. Initially, he was given Wu Zhu Yu pills, and the following day, he took equal parts of Ping Wei and Wu Ling powders. After three large doses, the blood stopped, but then he had white dysentery again. He took Gan Ying pills four times, and the white dysentery stopped, allowing him to return to his usual state. Someone asked: Why was Huang Lian and similar medicines not used to clear the toxins, but rather warm and hot agents? I replied: If cold and cooling medicines are used, the illness can greatly change, making it difficult to heal from internal cold and toxins. Additionally, using cold and cooling treatment is not the proper way to address this issue.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>Moreover, when blood is congealed by cold and seeps into the intestines leading to diarrhea, it requires warmth to flow naturally, which is why warm medicines are used; then the blood will stop. The classics state that to treat illness, one must seek the root cause, and this is what is meant. When the stomach is warmed, the blood will not congeal and will flow freely, each component maintaining its proper state. This example illustrates that one should not rigidly adhere to the idea of using cold. If one encounters dysentery with blood, it cannot simply be seen as a heat issue.</p>
<p>In general, if there is abdominal pain accompanied by a feeling of heaviness, reduced urination, thirst with a preference for cold drinks, and dryness in the intestines, this is categorized as a heat-related dysentery, and the previously mentioned methods are indeed appropriate. However, if there is abdominal pain without thirst, a preference for warm drinks, clear and frequent urination, no fever in the body, and a preference for warm compresses on the abdomen, this indicates a cold-related dysentery and should be treated with warming herbs like ginger and cinnamon.</p>
<p>As for the initial onset of illness, it is generally due to heat dysentery. If it lingers for a long time with persistent symptoms or even worsening conditions, it should be treated differently; in this case, one should not just observe but should use tonifying treatments to replenish the Middle and boost Qi. The approach of balancing nourishing and warming ingredients, such as ginseng and astragalus, is essential for effective treatment.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>If there is a heaviness in the lower abdomen and sharp pain resembling a bursting sensation, this indicates a condition attributed to the Lesser Yin. One should urgently add Wu Yao, Cinnamon, and fried fat, alongside the fruit of meat; if severe, include Aconite. If there is pure blood, add roasted black dried ginger, as a deficiency will self-cure the diarrhea. However, to wait for the blood-clear diarrhea to stop before supplementing is too late.</p>
<p>There are many cases in the world that seem like dysentery yet are not. Dongyuan states: Damage from diet and irregular living can harm the stomach qi, leading the ascending clear qi to descend instead, which is known as &quot;sour diarrhea.&quot; Prolonged cases may shift from the Greater Yin to the Lesser Yin, resulting in intestinal collapse. Symptoms may be urgency and a feeling of heaviness after defecation, with pus and blood mixing, often leading to frequent but ineffective bowel movements. In such cases, primarily use the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to facilitate the proper flow of ascending and descending, allowing the diarrhea to resolve on its own.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>I have studied the Eastern Garden. Generally, for anything hot, use ginger or Huanglian; for anything cold, add ginger and cinnamon. If there is cold accompanied by lower abdominal pain, use the Jianzhong Decoction. For wind and dampness, use Fangfeng and Qianghuo. If liver qi is affecting the spleen, use double the Chaihu with Shaoyao and Muxiang. For excess discharge, add millet husks and Haritaki. If warming and tonifying do not heal, another treatment should be considered. The classics state: if it is hot but not hot, there is no fire. No fire means nourishing the source of fire, urgently supplementing the fire at the life gate to nurture the mother of the spleen soil; this is the ultimate strategy. </p>
<p>There is also a type of yin deficiency resembling dysentery, specifically referring to frequent loose stools and abdominal distension. The classics say: urgency in the lower abdomen with a heavy feeling behind, frequently having the urge to defecate but unable to do so, there must be pain in the genitals. According to the Zhu family, if yin has been exhausted and further depleted, there will be pulling pain in bowel movements. The more pain, the more the urge to go; the more one goes, the more pain increases. The symptoms are a mix of red and white, urgency in the lower abdomen with heavy sensation, resembling dysentery, with painful and scanty urination, or painful obstruction, or the urge to urinate while passing stool first, or wanting to defecate but experiencing incontinence. The two excretions pull and cause pain; this is a critical sign of kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>Quickly use a mixture of eight ingredients: prepared Rehmannia, combined with wolfberry, nutmeg, and donkey-hide gelatin. Also, take the &quot;Treatise on the Middle&quot; decoction with additional herbs like Schizonepeta, cinnamon, and aconite, taking these in succession; this may help to restore health. In the world, cases where diarrhea-inducing medicine leads to death are countless; I have detailed this specifically in the section on diarrhea in the &quot;Essentials of Pre-Heaven.&quot; </p>
<p>For one type of accumulation that has lessened, but is still present, if one sits idly and exerts effort, this indicates a significant loss of blood; in this case, use a primary dosage of Angelica as the main herb, with blood-nourishing herbs as supplements, as blood will naturally restore equilibrium. This is a case of blood deficiency with yin symptoms.</p>
<p>There are two conditions afterward: If the pathogenic qi has descended, there is no relief after defecation; if there is weakness and effort to expel waste without retention, relief will be experienced after defecation. This can distinguish between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>There is a type of dysentery characterized by a tightness in the throat where medicine enters and quickly exits; the lower body feels constricted and urgent. This is often caused by intense heat and toxins, which clash against the stomach, causing the stomach energy to be suppressed and unexpressed. In urgent cases, use Huanglian (Coptis) prepared with Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia) that has been stir-fried and then removed, with the addition of equal parts of ginseng—about a pinch, concentrated and boiled down to a small cup. Take it spoonful by spoonful, and as long as one or two spoonfuls are swallowed, vomiting will no longer occur. If vomiting recurs, take again.</p>
<p>There is another type where cold energy rises; use warming and nourishing medicine to adjust this condition, as it is easier to treat.</p>
<p>There is also a type considered &quot;resting dysentery&quot; that recurs over many months or years; this is due to cold accumulating at the bottom of the large intestine, where other medicines cannot reach. Only with a single ingredient, Ba Dou (Semen Crotonis), ground and stir-fried into waxy pills the size of longan, taken on an empty stomach, will it not recur. This method is a common and effective approach.</p>
<p>For cases of dysentery that follow malaria, or vice versa, after malaria, all excretions have been dispelled, removing heat toxins. If dysentery occurs afterward, it indicates a collapse of vital energy, with spleen energy unable to rise, appearing like dysentery but not truly dysentery. After dysentery, excessive discharge may lead to blood loss, with energy dispersing alongside the dysentery. This results in both yin and yang being deficient; yang deficiency leads to aversion to cold, whereas yin deficiency leads to aversion to heat, causing a conflict between cold and heat, resembling malaria but not truly malaria. Hence, a theory of deficiency is formulated and treated with strengthening and warming tonics for self-recovery.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>On Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery is a condition that is difficult to describe. In the &quot;Ling&quot; and &quot;Su,&quot; it is referred to as &quot;intestine collapse&quot; and also as &quot;obstructed discharge.&quot; The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; categorizes vomiting, sudden diarrhea, and dysentery as a single condition, as all three stem from illnesses of the Yangming stomach and the hand Yangming large intestine. However, when discussing diarrhea, it aligns with the main symptoms of the Jueyin channel in &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; and this does not match with the vomiting and sudden diarrhea of the two Yangming categories. </p>
<p>In their discourse, both Jue and diarrhea are frequently mentioned together. It is first stated that if the qi of the six fu organs is exhausted externally, the hands and feet are cold; if the qi of the five zang organs is exhausted internally, diarrhea cannot be controlled. Thus, the dual presence of Jue and diarrhea signifies extreme deficiency and coldness. For those who can still eat, they die, but those who develop a fever often do not. Why is there such a contradiction? </p>
<p>This likely stems from the omission of dysentery from the section on vomiting and sudden diarrhea in the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; and subsequently, the incorporation of the lower diarrhea narrative from the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage.&quot; Many later practitioners have repeatedly tried and failed to verify this, leading to frequent errors in practice.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>In winter, during the month when cold leads to diarrhea, and in summer and autumn, when heat causes diarrhea, one might invoke Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s treatments and speak in vain about techniques? Later generations, lacking guidance, present their own biased views based on what they observe with their eyes and test with their hands, spreading widely these notions, which cannot be considered as proper methods, hence declaring that there are no correct formulas for dysentery and malaria. How did medical practice come to such a state? I respectfully reference the methods of Zhang Zhongjing of Huangqi and propose this discussion. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that in winter, cold leads to illness and fever, while in summer and autumn, the three heat energies of summer heat and humidity intermingle and produce heat that is much stronger than in winter. When externally induced heat from the three energies leads to diarrhea, it must be expelled from the outside. Therefore, diarrhea must first be resolved by sweating to treat the exterior and then regulate the interior. Firstly, use warming herbs to resolve the exterior, and secondly, use bitter cold herbs to clear the interior; one or two doses may cure. If there is neglect in treating the exterior, the external pathogens will escape through the interior, leading to a situation where one does not recover and cannot stop suffering. Thus, even after a hundred days, one should still apply methods akin to rowing against the current to draw out the pathogens to the exterior, as those on the brink of death may still be saved and those in critical condition can be stabilized.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>When treating chronic diarrhea, the effects are clear and can be documented. It is detailed in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; that if one has a reeling pulse with diarrhea and experiences fever and sweating, they will recover on their own. In cases of prolonged diarrhea, the pulse is deeply rooted in the yin portion, and it becomes soft and weak. Suddenly, if the pulse changes to a reeling quality, this indicates the emergence of yang energy; without using reversal techniques, how could this occur? Prolonged diarrhea allows the evil to invade the yin, and the body will not be hot; if there is any deficiency heat, it will lead to a persistent fever. Now, due to the method of reversal, we force a temporary surge of disturbances, and soon the evil is expelled from the surface, causing the heat to dissipate. Prolonged diarrhea leads to a sinking of yang energy, resulting in dry skin and an absence of sweat. Now, using the reversal techniques to support the exterior yang, we drive the evil back to the surface, causing sweating, which results in a calm abdomen and ultimately the resolution of the illness.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>How could one dare to rely on untrained intellect? Moreover, there is the sudden onslaught of summer heat and dampness, causing water and food to exit the body. In a day and night, one may sweat profusely and drink excessively, with thirst unquenchable. This signifies that the intestines and stomach are under attack from hot toxins, quickly rotting away. This condition is tenfold more severe than ingesting purgative poison or lead. The method of forcefully countering this is both misguided and far-fetched! </p>
<p>One should adhere to the principles outlined in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; using such remedies as rhubarb, coptis, and licorice, taking them three to five doses over a day and night, waiting for the downward force of diarrhea and the thirst to ease before beginning to balance internally. There is no need to resort to external measures since the hostility, like water breaking against stone, will naturally exit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the emergency method of rapidly opening the &quot;river&quot; of the body. The heat and toxins inside rush towards the large intestine and may become obstructed in the bladder. If the bladder is hot and stagnant, the transformation of qi is impaired, leading to short, painful urination. Hence, it is more appropriate to facilitate this flow rather than forcibly countering the condition. Clearing the bladder allows for qi to flow and dissipate the heat swiftly.</p>
<p>Zhongjing stated: &quot;When there is a downward flow of qi, one should promote urination.&quot; Qi is the essence transformed by the bladder; if it is instead being expelled from the large intestine, then facilitating urination is indeed necessary. However, when water flows from a high source and the lungs are not hot, urination will occur naturally. The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; the heat of the large intestine arises from the heat of the lungs. Thus, it is particularly important to use cool, pungent medicines to first clear the transformation source in the lungs.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; for diarrhea and lung pain, the main prescription is Zishen Decoction, while Qilei Le Powder is also indicated. Later generations doubted that these two formulas were from Zhongjing, not realizing that intestinal and stomach issues are fundamentally connected to the lungs. The &quot;Bencao&quot; states: Zishen is for the accumulation in the chest and abdomen, treating internal heat in the intestines and stomach, unblocking the nine orifices, and facilitating urination and defecation. Zhongjing selected it for its principle of unblocking through the means of unblocking use. Qilei Le has both unblocking and obstructing effects; it clears phlegm, digests stagnant food, resolves qi stagnation, while also firming up the intestines to prevent collapse. Zhongjing chose it for its mutual application of unblocking and obstructing as well. Thus, if there is pain due to obstructed lung qi, one should urgently clear that obstruction; if the large intestine&#39;s qi is descending and causing pressure, then mutual application of unblocking and obstructing will help regulate its appropriateness. Alas! The methods of the &quot;Neijing&quot; may not be directly actionable; one seeks from the &quot;Jinkui&quot;; when the methods for diarrhea in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; seem unapproachable, turn to the spirit of one&#39;s own heart in wakefulness and dream, and one will understand the &quot;Jinkui&quot; methods as if they are at one’s fingertips.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>Unfortunately, youthful time has been wasted, and now I am old, unable to make further progress. I write these humble thoughts as a contribution for later generations to delve deeper into this subject.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of malaria, one should progress from the lesser yang and retreat in between. Advancing towards the yang should indeed start with the lesser yang as a guiding principle. Likewise, for dysentery, one should also refer to the lesser yang, since the qi from food and drink enters the stomach and moves rapidly downward; initially, the energy of the lesser yang is not able to expand, and subsequently, it becomes trapped. Thus, rather than broadly seeking the three yang, it is better to specifically seek the lesser yang, allowing the clear energy from the heavens to elevate and the flavors of the water and earth to transform naturally, with subtle and proper dispersal, avoiding the suffering of urgent dysentery.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the bodily fluids stored in the two yangming channels have already been excreted, one should not further induce sweating. The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; clearly states the prohibition on sweating when in the presence of yangming excess, and the &quot;Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet&quot; reinforces the ban on inducing sweating in cases of diarrhea, stating that one should not attack the exterior when there is clear diarrhea from food intake, as sweating will inevitably lead to fullness and distension.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>Excessive loss of bodily fluids harms the essence; sweating further depletes these fluids. When bodily fluids are diminished, the stomach energy is void, leading to the escape of turbid air downwards. This, compounded by the upward flow of sweat, results in bloating and fullness. When one seeks resolution for the diarrhea but cannot find it, is this not a serious warning? Therefore, one should adhere to the method of the lesser yang, gently reversing the descending clear energy, allowing the body to follow the natural orders of spring and summer without causing repression. In essence, this is a harmonizing method, entirely distinct from the intention of inducing sweat. If the bodily fluids are not harmed, sweating does not pose a problem; but if the fluids are harmed, any slight moisture between the skin is already indicative of rising problematic energy. Can the exterior invasion of wind and cold in the greater yang simply be treated with sweating? Can the combined conditions of the greater yang and yangming presenting with diarrhea be treated like that with kudzu root? Alas! How subtle this is! </p>
<p>For treating dysentery, use the method that is open and prevalent, alongside the gold needle technique. The pathogenic fire, dampness, and heat press forth and should only be remedied with bitter and cold herbs, such as those found in the major and minor purge formulas. Prescription texts often mix in warming herbs for the middle and to strengthen the intestines and stomach, which is aimed at establishing a foundation against the fire, dampness, and heat.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>To treat dysentery with a tight mouth, many use Huang Lian, which is indeed a medicine for damp-heat, but it is bitter and descending, unable to open and uplift; moreover, it is not suitable for cases of stomach deficiency, hence I dare not use it. Some use the mud of pond snails, applied to the navel, to guide the heat downwards, which is most effective. However, when there is stagnant heat, one should alternate between ascending and descending methods, and cannot rely solely on one approach. Using spices like clove and sand cardamom with fire to aid fire can lead to harm.</p>
<p>In cases where diarrhea occurs prior to dysentery, it is an indication of reversal. If the condition persists despite attempts to reopen, it indicates deficiency. A weak and slow pulse calls for warming and tonifying treatment. A taut and rapid pulse indicates reversal and is a sign of imminent death. Postpartum dysentery also requires warming and tonification.</p>
<p>For cases with blood in the stool, cooling and activating the blood is necessary, using herbs like Angelica, Huangqin, and peach kernel. If there is evil wind descending, a lifting approach is needed. If damp-heat injures the blood, one should clarify dampness and clear heat.</p>
<p>For long-term dysentery with blood that does not heal, it indicates yang deficiency and yin evacuation, warranting the use of Ba Zhen Decoction with herbs that uplift. If there are paroxysms from below, with cold limbs, and the pulse gradually weakens, this signals a risk of vital energy collapse; urgent moxibustion at the Qihai point and using Fuzi Lichong Decoction is crucial—delay can lead to death.</p>
<p>For chronic dysentery with a weak and sinking pulse, where various medicines are ineffective, one can use Shiquan Dabu Decoction with ginger and jujube, adding a small amount of honey to be consumed as a decoction.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>In treating dysentery, if one does not distinguish between the root causes and symptoms, and hastily employs bitter cold remedies, it is a medical error. </p>
<p>From the perspective of the intestines and stomach, the large intestine represents the symptoms and the stomach represents the root cause. From the perspective of the meridians, the Yangming channels of the hands and feet represent the symptoms, while the Shaoyang fire represents the root cause. Thus, when the stomach is affected by damp-heat, the food and water are transformed by the fire of the Shaoyang into foul and turbid substances, which then enter the large intestine. If one only treats the Yangming channel without addressing the Shaoyang, it will be of no benefit. The vital energy generated by the Shaoyang flows downward into the earth, and if it is not first lifted with warm and acrid remedies, but rather directly countered with bitter cold ones, dysentery will have no end.</p>
<p>In treating dysentery, if one fails to assess the condition&#39;s true nature, clinging to conventional methods while relying on mere superficial knowledge, it is also a medical error. </p>
<p>The term &quot;real&quot; refers to the presence of pathogenic factors, while &quot;deficient&quot; refers to the weakness of the body&#39;s vital energy. In cases of seven real and three deficient, attacking the pathogenic factor comes first. In cases of seven deficient and three real, supporting the body&#39;s energy is fundamental.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>When there is excessive evil, it corresponds to a strong fire consuming vital energy, and there is no proper way to support it, so one must urgently remove the evil to preserve the true. When there is excessive emptiness and evil, it corresponds to a state of faintness, with nothing substantial to attack, so one must urgently restore the true and allow the evil to leave on its own. Therefore, a physician who does not understand the need for adaptation and merely adheres to ancestral knowledge makes the gravest mistakes.</p>
<p>In treating dysentery, if one does not differentiate between the severity of damp-heat, and indiscriminately administers compounded pills, it is the fault of the physician. Dysentery arises from internal damp-heat, and if bitter-cold remedies are to be used, they should be decocted and not made into pills. Pills cannot purge effectively, and often contain harmful ingredients like croton seeds, light powder, fixed powder, sulfur, realgar, senna, euphorbia, pharbitis, black plum, or millet husk. Even if the illness is alleviated, the remaining medicine can cause great harm. Moreover, if the illness does not subside, the poison can become more severe, making recovery very difficult. Should one not be cautious?<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br><strong>Jingyue Quanshu [Complete Book of Jingyue] by Zhang Jiebin (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Proof</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery is more prevalent at the turn of summer and autumn. Traditional methods passed down through the ages all assert that the fierce summer heat leads to the commanding of the fire element, which, combined with the intense heat&#39;s toxin, accumulates to cause dysentery. </p>
<p>Contemporary beliefs largely align with this notion that dysentery arises from summer heat, making it understandable that it involves heat. However, heat is a natural phenomenon of heaven. If there is a day when it is not hot, it inevitably leads to disaster. It is common for individuals to desire coolness due to the heat. Overindulging in raw and cold foods is what brings about dysentery.</p>
<p>Many who are cautious of illness, despite exposure to intense heat, do not suffer from cold and coolness, hence they experience no dysentery. Is it not that they uniquely do not succumb to heat? The illness actually stems from the cold evil rather than the summer heat; it lies in human actions, rather than the weather. This can be deduced clearly.</p>
<p>However, those with strong stomachs and solid vitality can consume fruits and similar items daily and remain healthy, thus avoiding illness. </p>
<p>Those slightly weaker may not be ill immediately, but over time, when the intense heat shifts westward and the newly cool air arrives, the lurking internal yin becomes active, seizing the opportunity to strike. Thus, cold dampness tends to invade the spleen particularly in the months of July and August, marking the transition from yang declining to yin rising, which is easy to observe.</p>
<p>Lastly, those with inherently weak spleens and stomachs will easily fall ill as conditions arise without needing to be exposed to cold, nor waiting for the season; this is particularly common.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>Eating cold foods causes diarrhea; how can this possibly turn into heat? How is it that modern medicine sees only the heat of the season and not the coldness in a person&#39;s organs? They only recognize the symptoms of dysentery, hastily declaring it as hot poison, and instead treat the cold with cooling methods. Is this not like adding frost on snow? Common understanding leads to many deaths. Some may claim that there are instances where cold medicines lead to recovery; why is this? It is due to individuals with strong stomachs and an abundance of yang who develop heat from dampness. There are also those whose vital energy is robust and where the evil does not overpower the righteous. Cases like these can use cold treatments and recover, or they may benefit from purging methods, but these individuals are extremely rare. Many, however, have weak stomachs and yang deficiency, suffering injury from cold. For these individuals, further use of cooling treatments or rash purging will invariably lead to death. All those who die from dysentery belong to this category. Observing Danxi, it is said that those with dysentery are more often of the heat type than of the cold type. Dai Yuanli states that the intense heat poison, as autumn arrives, when the yang energy begins to decline and fire energy decreases, leads to stagnation-related symptoms. These are all grievous misunderstandings and should not be trusted. A popular saying cautions us: &quot;In hot summer, yin evils easily invade. Heat is the main affliction, while wind and cold are the guests. If the body is not exposed to wind, how can malaria develop? If the mouth does not receive cold, how can dysentery occur?&quot; Treatment must seek the root cause, beyond mere fleeting symptoms. This subtle wisdom can be a guiding principle for physicians.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Yin and Yang</h3>
<p>In treating dysentery, it is crucial to observe the nature of Yin and Yang, and distinguish between cold and heat; this is the most significant relationship in dysentery. If these four aspects are unclear, it becomes very easy to cause harm.</p>
<p>In distinguishing between excess conditions, one must note a robust physical appearance, strong and smooth pulse, or a history of indulgence in food and drink, or notable abdominal distension, hardness, and pain, especially in younger patients with recent onset and without damage to the spleen&#39;s energy; only then can one employ symptomatic treatments. For mild cases, promote movement; for more severe cases, use purgatives.</p>
<p>In distinguishing deficiency conditions, look for weakened body structure, pale or bluish complexion, pulse that is rapid yet weak and lacking vitality, pulse that appears firm yet is actually weak, patients with inherent Yang deficiency, those prone to coldness or subtle indigestion, encountering cold or damp weather, or cases of improper diet, particularly in individuals with weaker spleens due to age. In all these instances, if there has been no prior indulgence and dysentery suddenly occurs, it is likely due to consuming something cold or a slight injury to stomach energy; there would be no accumulation or heat present. Hence, those with weak spleens often exhibit such symptoms.</p>
<p>For treatment, one should only warm and regulate the spleen and stomach; warming the spleen will dispel cold, thus expelling the pathogen. Furthermore, the pathogens themselves are not numerous; employing warming tonics to strengthen the spleen poses no risk. A few doses will lead to complete recovery. It is essential not to hastily claim that tonics will trap the pathogens and thus proceed with harsh purgatives or fire-clearing medicines first. If the spleen&#39;s energy is further damaged, lighter cases will worsen and severe cases will become critical.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br><strong>On Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>In distinguishing the symptoms of dysentery as cold or heat, if it is indeed heat, one will surely fear heat and prefer coolness, not wanting clothing or blankets, experiencing extreme thirst and drinking a lot of water, with possibly hot and painful urination or diarrhea that is purely bright red blood. The pulse will certainly be slippery, firm, and strong, and one’s physical condition will be restless and irritable. If the heat symptoms are genuine, then cooling treatments should be employed, possibly combined with methods to expel the pathogenic influences; the illness will heal on its own. However, if these heat symptoms are not present and the dysentery persists, it must be due to deficiency and cold. If one does not warm and tonify the spleen and kidneys, healing cannot be achieved; even if there is some recovery, it must be that the underlying energy is well-rooted, waiting for its return. One should not believe that there are deficiency and cold symptoms that can heal without warming and tonifying. Sometimes treatments for dysentery must be cool, and while cooling methods can be harmless, if not applied properly, they can lead to complications.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Accumulation of Filth</h3>
<p>The issue of accumulation in the abdomen involves the stagnation of food and drink that gathers within, sometimes forming lumps, or causing distension and pain, not digesting or moving due to obstruction—this is what is termed accumulation, which should be expelled. However, people today are unable to discern this properly; they see diarrhea with purulent filth and wrongly label it as accumulation, not realizing that this does not fall under the category of stagnant matter but is actually fat that adheres to the intestines and viscera, all belonging to the essence of blood. Regardless of whether one is thin or fat, all have this fat; the fat is thicker in the fat person and thinner in the thin person, and there is no one without fat. If there were truly no fat, how would the space between the intestines permit anything to be thin and exposed? Not only would this lack of support be insecure, but the organs would also be easily harmed—this is illogical. In the case of those suffering from diarrhea, it is merely the fat of the five internal organs that is not secure, causing it to be stripped away daily. If the strength of the organ&#39;s energy is slightly robust, it can go and come as it pleases, and there is little to worry about. If the organ&#39;s energy deteriorates, being stripped away completely, or if one suffers from prolonged diarrhea, only observing blood and watery discharge, the average person may claim that there is no longer lingering accumulation and even deem it good, not knowing that if the fat is scraped away completely, it signifies an extreme dangerous condition. If one recognizes this as fat rather than accumulation, then there is no time to be at ease or secure, yet one still dares to say to attack and expel it, or to use bitter cold to lubricate and benefit?<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Colors</strong></p>
<p>The distinctions among the five colors are akin to the substances of diarrhea and pus, all of which are transformed by the blood and energy. The white color arises more superficially, resembling the floating fats; the red color comes from deeper sources, associated with fats that penetrate the skin and vessels. When there is pure blood, it often signifies heat pressing upon it, thus it spills over and flows down, which is the deepest condition. The purple-red and purple-white colors indicate a prolonged separation, where the discharge doesn’t occur quickly, and the colors change due to that delay, or they haven&#39;t yet reached the vessels, marking a slightly shallower condition. When red and white are combined, this indicates variations in depth. Generally, pure bright red signifies more heat pathology, as its fiery nature is urgent and forceful in its descent. Purple-red and purple-white indicate less heat pathology, due to the stagnation and damage caused by cold Yin. Pure white signifies no heat pathology, as it arises from the organs&#39; cold, thin, and slippery conditions. However, there are cases of being without red while still indicating heat; this falls into the category of violent onset, not merely classified as diarrhea.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>There are instances where a deep purple-red color appears, yet it cannot be said to be hot. This is due to damage to the yin network, rather than a violent outpouring. When distinguishing between the yellow and black colors, any deep yellow that is foul and smelly indicates a presence of heat, as well as cold. If the yellow is light and less odorous, possibly accompanied by a fishy odor (suggesting consumption on the left and retention on the right), this indicates a type that does not transform, which is all cold. A thick, black color that is very foul-smelling indicates a scorched condition, often associated with heat. However, a bluish-black that is thin and fishy represents decay in the liver and kidneys, yet it is still mistakenly considered as heat. Although the differentiation of the five colors generally follows this pattern, in cases of dysentery with blood, it is solely due to injury to the yin network. Whether it is cold or hot, if the network vessels are damaged, bleeding will occur. Therefore, one cannot simply assume that blood presence indicates heat. In any case of this symptom, one should comprehensively examine the pulse, color, form, energy, and cause of the illness.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Abdominal Pain</h3>
<p>In cases of diarrhea and abdominal pain, there are those with excess heat and those with deficiency cold. For excess heat, it may arise from food accumulation or the invasion of pathogenic heat. However, the pain from food accumulation is usually accompanied by distension, fullness, and hardness, or it is painful to the touch, indicating that there is something stagnating. For minor cases, it is advisable to eliminate the stagnation, while for severe cases, purging and expelling it is suitable. </p>
<p>In cases of pain from pathogenic heat, there will often be signs of internal heat, hence it is appropriate to clear and benefit the body. However, when there is a substantial pathogenic presence inside, there will often be a lot of rebellious qi. Therefore, the method of treating pain, whether it’s due to heat or food, should always prioritize the movement of qi, while considering the nature of the remedies in terms of heat and cold, and selecting them accordingly.</p>
<p>Abdominal pain from deficiency cold is particularly important to distinguish. Generally, pain from diarrhea is mostly due to cold qi in the organs. The classics say: pain is often due to an excess of cold qi. Thus, pain occurs because of cold. It also states: illness causing pain is associated with yin. Therefore, if a person overeats raw or cold foods, or is exposed to cold air, they may experience abdominal pain; this is well understood. </p>
<p>If cold is present internally, the treatment should warm the spleen; if cold is in the lower regions, the treatment should warm the kidneys. Furthermore, the principle of deficiency cold causing pain is often not well known. If the original qi is insufficient internally, even without external cold pathogens, if the internal qi is not warmed, this is a cold syndrome. As a result, diarrhea cannot be stopped, food cannot be digested, and the illness cannot be cured, precisely because there is a deficiency of yang leading to excess cold.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>The persistent diarrhea causes damage to the stomach qi, and with the essence and blood harming the skin, how can there be no pain? This pain results from the inflammation reaching the intestines. Therefore, diarrhea is caused by pain, and pain arises from diarrhea. Thus, any invasion of cold into the internal organs or injury to the meridians and vessels leading to blood movement and qi stagnation can produce pain. However, it is important to note if the condition is weak and not solid, if there is a tendency to enjoy gentle pressure or warmth, if the chest and abdomen feel empty and there is a lack of desire to eat, or if there is nausea with excess salivation, but without indicators of solid heat, then it is generally classified as deficiency and cold. How can pain be said to always stem from accumulation and to always indicate solid proof in such cases? </p>
<p>In treating pain caused by deficiency and cold, it is essential to promptly warm and nourish the internal qi, without further depleting it, which would lead to a nurturing pain becoming worse, and smooth maladies becoming more pronounced, posing a significant risk. Some claim that pain does not warrant tonics until it has stabilized, but this can deplete vital essence day by day, with no end in sight. I&#39;ve seen a physician state that dysentery must last seven days before tonics can be used, ignorant that the patient may die within six days. This stubbornness is exceedingly foolish.</p>
<p>However, for those with intense pain, it is advisable to slightly add an aromatic herb, such as patchouli, to the nourishing concoction to harmonize the qi, or to increase angelica to regulate blood; once the pain alleviates, these two ingredients should be removed. This caution stems from the fear of patchouli depleting qi and angelica causing excessive intestinal relaxation. If the cold is in the lower burner inducing pain, then the addition of evodia is necessary. If the pain is not severe, then the primary approach should center on warming and tonifying the spleen and kidneys; as the condition stabilizes, the pain should naturally subside without needing specific treatment for the pain.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>When there is urgency and heaviness in the lower abdomen, the illness resides at the lowest part of the large intestine, but its root cause is not in the large intestine; it lies in the spleen and kidneys. Various forms of dysentery, whether hot, cold, or arising from deficiency, are present and cannot all be classified as heat. If there is heat in the middle burner, it compels heat pathogens downwards; if there is cold in the middle burner, it compels cold pathogens downwards; if there is deficiency of spleen and kidney qi, it causes qi to descend and press downwards. To treat this, one must first understand the cause and then address the root of the spleen and kidneys, and there will be no case that does not heal.</p>
<p>However, if the illness is in the large intestine, it is no longer simply a case of food accumulation. When food accumulation reaches this point, it would not leave any residue upon diarrhea; what remains is merely the descending qi, which is formless. Thus, even if there seems to be an urge to expel, in reality, there is nothing to expel. When there is nothing to expel yet it appears there is an urge, it is purely the effect of qi. Hence, the use of Shao Yao Decoction by Hejian, which claims that moving the blood leads to self-healing and adjusting the qi alleviates heaviness at the back, is indeed logical. However, adjusting the qi must be done appropriately: for heat in the qi, cool it; for cold in the qi, warm it; for deficiency in the qi, tonify it; for descending qi, uplift it; it is essential to harmonize the qi, only then can it be regulated. The method of moving blood is similar. If one merely uses ingredients like Mu Xiang, Bing Lang, Dang Gui, and Da Huang to dispel qi and move blood, as a means of harmonization without realizing that the large intestine is the farthest point, thus making it difficult for the medicine to reach it, what actually disperses and moves is merely the qi of the middle burner. Moreover, if the qi has already descended, further dispersing and moving it will only cause it to descend further; will there be any possibility of healing? Moreover, dysentery must stop before heaviness can stop, and there has never been a case where dysentery does not heal and yet heaviness can heal. Therefore, anyone wishing to treat this should focus on treating the dysentery as the main priority.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br><strong>On Pain from the Large Intestine</strong></p>
<p>In cases of dysentery, there are often pains from the large intestine. What is the reason for this? It is because the spleen and stomach are out of harmony; thus, the vital essence of food and drink fails to transform properly, leading to oppressive and foul substances being expelled through the orifices, resulting in unavoidable pain. Furthermore, if fire causes diarrhea and yang is driven away by yin, then the yang energy in the stomach becomes forced downward, unable to disperse, which gives rise to swelling. Therefore, where dysentery is more severe, pain is also greater; where dysentery is less severe, pain is also less. Pain and absence of pain are determined by whether the energy is trapped or not. Consequently, regardless of whether it is cold dysentery or hot dysentery, pain can arise from the large intestine and cannot be solely attributed to heat. To treat this, one need only address the dysentery; when the dysentery ceases, the swelling and pain will naturally resolve, akin to the principle of heaviness after defecation. As Danxi stated: pain from the large intestine arises when heat flows downward, and the main remedies are musk, areca nut, scutellaria, and coptis combined with fried ginger. This shows that it is known that fire can cause swelling and pain, but how does one comprehend the sinking of original yang? Subsequent generations have all followed this method. As for those with deficiency and cold, many cannot endure this condition.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Thirst</h3>
<p>All cases of dysentery must involve significant thirst. Nowadays, people only see thirst and immediately attribute it to heat, not realizing that both those with heat and those without can experience thirst. It is crucial to distinguish between the two. When heat is strong within, it scorches the spleen and burns the stomach, depleting fluids and causing a strong craving for cold water, which they consume excessively to the point of never growing tired of it; the cooler it is, the more they desire it. This indicates thirst due to heat, which requires treatment with cooling methods. </p>
<p>However, if the mouth is hot and thirsty, but one cannot drink much water despite wanting to, this is not true heat and should not be treated with cooling methods. Generally, if the mouth is dry and thirsty preferring coolness, but the stomach does not tolerate coolness, this indicates cold accumulating within, while superficial heat lingers above. Such cases strongly contraindicate cold remedies. </p>
<p>Thirst can be genuine or deceptive. A true thirst must prefer tea; just by observing the preference for hot or cold, one can discern the nature of the heat or cold.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Like someone who is thirsty, they may feel dry, but it does not mean they are truly thirsty. If the mouth is dry yet there is no desire to drink, it indicates that it is certainly not a heat syndrome. However, in cases of diarrhea, because the fluids leak downwards, there will inevitably be a depletion of fluids upwards, hence the feeling of thirst cannot be avoided. Thirst accompanied by a desire to drink is due to insufficient internal fluids, seeking external fluids for assistance; it does not necessarily indicate the presence of heat. Therefore, one must carefully assess whether there is heat or not. If there is an excess of heat, one should clear the heat; if there is a deficiency of water, one should nourish the yin. Moreover, qi is the mother of water; if there is qi deficiency that cannot generate water, without nourishing the mother, water cannot be produced and thirst remains unrelieved. The spleen governs water; if there is spleen deficiency that cannot control water, without strengthening the main organ, water cannot be stored and thirst persists. If one can treat the cause of thirst rather than just addressing the thirst itself, what need is there for a thirst condition?<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br><strong>On Small Urine</strong></p>
<p>In all cases of dysentery, small urine will often be abundant and not beneficial; there may be much yellow or red. This is significantly related to the conditions of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess, and must not be overlooked. If there is sudden diarrhea, due to the unclear distinction between clean and turbid, food and fluids both enter the large intestine, hence the water may not be beneficial; this is only temporary. However, in dysentery accompanied by small urine, the underlying illness is not uniform. Nowadays, people merely see yellow or red and conclude it is heat, which leads to many misunderstandings. In cases due to heat, the heat must be very intense and may involve considerable pain or fresh blood; only then should there be signs of heat both above and below. This indicates true heat, which should be treated with cooling methods. If it is not true heat, it may arise from internal cold constraining the yang in the lower region, or from the loss of yin due to diarrhea causing water to be depleted and the color to change, or from the lower yang&#39;s failure to warm and transform water, or from improper use of astringent methods that deplete fluids. However, if there is no fire in the three warmers, then despite the yellow or turbid appearance, it suggests a lack of yin and fluids, and can&#39;t simply be analyzed as heat. It is imperative to nourish and support true yin as it is the best approach. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;When the middle qi is insufficient, urine and stools will change.&quot; How profound are these words! Why do people nowadays fail to recognize this? Additionally, whenever small urine is clear and accompanied by abdominal pain, they still apply herbs like Qin and Lian, but do not understand what this implies.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br><strong>On the Doubts and Similarities of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The principle of Yin and Yang is the foundation of nurturing life and treating diseases, yet it is not easily understood by people due to its unpredictable nature. The function of Yin and Yang seeks mutual support, not mutual harm. Mutual support means harmony; there cannot be Yin without Yang, nor Yang withoutYin. Mutual harm causes damage. When Yang harms Yin, it results in withering; when Yin harms Yang, it brings about extinction. All diseases are due to the mutual harm of Yin and Yang, resulting in a loss of harmony. </p>
<p>The nature of Yin and Yang is such that Yin prefers stillness and hates motion, while Yang enjoys warmth and fears cold. When they harm each other, Yin fears the excess of Yang, leading to either withering or desiccation; Yang fears the toxins of Yin, leading to either fleeing or flying away in the presence of Yin&#39;s invasion, which embodies the jealousy of Yin and Yang. </p>
<p>In cases of severe illness that exhibit doubt between false and true, this reflects the evidence. This is particularly evident in cases of typhus and dysentery. Nowadays, those suffering from dysentery often exhibit signs of heat in both the upper and lower parts of the body, which does not always indicate true heat. How can this be observed? For instance, agitation can seem like heat but is not true heat; restlessness can appear mad yet is not madness, leading to a state too vague to describe. This does not represent true Yang evidence. </p>
<p>This agitation is the result of damaged essence and blood, with the fire not having water to cool it, leading to the depletion of Yin&#39;s stillness. Additionally, symptoms where one feels hot above or has pain below, such as thirst and sore throats or redness and heat in the body, may not correspond to true heat.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>Water and fire mutually constrain each other; the yang drives away the yin. When fire departs from its proper position, it causes erratic movements. Nowadays, people only observe these symptoms and say that one must look to the physical manifestations of the illness. If the heat from physical symptoms is evident, they still claim it is cold. This reflects an awareness of external heat without recognizing the internal cold, similar to being aware of heat above and not knowing the cold in the middle. Furthermore, how can they understand that restlessness indicates yin deficiency and erratic movements signify yang deficiency? Even within uncertainty, one must still discern clearly. For instance, when the exterior muscles exhibit heat symptoms, one ought to feel aversion to heat, yet they refuse to part from their clothing or coverings. Some may even prefer warmth on their abdomen, indicating the need for warmth or pressure; despite feeling hot externally, there may still be cold internally.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>In addition, when there is heat evidence in all nine orifices, there is a strong desire for cold drinks. However, while there may be a craving for cold in the mouth, the stomach fears it. Therefore, any cold that goes down may increase vomiting, aggravate abdominal pain, cause choking, or lead to bloating and discomfort. Even if the mouth and tongue have sores and pain, there is still a desire for hot soup and drinks. This indicates that although there is heat above and below, there is cold in the middle burner. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases of weak yang energy and a faint pulse, as previously discussed. If one only recognizes this as fire and treats it with cold, while the underlying issue is internal cold, adding more cold will only invade the stomach and directly affect the middle burner. The external heat does not relate to this, and the internal cold will become even more severe. Consequently, those who are already ill will become more ill, akin to adding frost on snow. The desire to preserve the solitary yang cannot be achieved. Therefore, in treating such conditions, one should only be able to draw the fire back to its source, warming the elixir field; thus, the fire will then dry out. By solidifying the lower source, energy returns to essence. This is the mysterious principle of the reversal of yin and yang.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p>
<h3>On Treating</h3>
<p>In general, the principles for treating dysentery involve understanding the conditions of deficiency and excess, cold and heat; grasping these essentials leads to success, while losing sight of them results in the greatest harm. The methods for regulating diarrhea should be carefully applied.</p>
<p>When initially hurt by cold and when dietary irregularities occur, if the stomach qi remains intact and the original qi is not depleted, symptoms such as intense pain, bloating, violent diarrhea, or dysentery might arise, especially if there is food stagnation that hasn&#39;t cleared. In such cases, a dose of Five Virtues Pills, or formulas like Ping Wei San, Wei Ling Tang, and Wu Ling San should be used to mildly dispel cold stagnation; recovery is very attainable.</p>
<p>For those with weak spleen and kidneys who suffer from cold, dysentery can easily occur, regardless of whether they are adults or children. For cases of spleen deficiency leading to dysentery, without the presence of excess heat or other symptoms, it is advisable to first warm the spleen using Guan Jian. If the illness has progressed to involve the liver and kidneys, then Wei Guan Jian is most effective; do not fear using it due to its newness. Alternatively, other formulations like Five Virtues Pills and Four Spirits Pills can also be utilized.</p>
<p>In severe cases of both spleen and kidney deficiency, use Wei Guan Jian as the first choice, followed by Wen Wei Yin, or use both alternately as needed. One may also combine it with formulas like Si Wei San, Jiu Qi Dan, or Fu Yang Dan.</p>
<p>For dysentery accompanied by vomiting and a strong urge to vomit, or if there is a feeling of nausea upon smelling food, this indicates that cold has weakened the stomach qi, making it unable to tolerate. It is essential to warm and nourish the stomach. Use prescriptions like Wu Jun Zi Jian, Liu Wei Yi Gong Jian, Wen Wei Yin, and Sheng Zhu San for this condition. If vomiting is severe, then Liu Wei Hui Yang Yin should be the primary treatment. If there is a deficiency of fire in the yin, causing nausea due to qi not returning to the original source, then Wei Guan Jian and Li Yin Jian should be used as the main treatments.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>If gastrointestinal fire rises and causes vomiting, there will necessarily be symptoms of heat and fullness, and cooling and fire-reducing herbs can be used, such as large doses of Qingyin Decoction and Yiyuan Powder. </p>
<p>In cases of exuberant damp-heat, with vexation and a preference for coolness, a firm pulse and abdominal fullness, or pure bright red diarrhea, it is advisable to use Qingliang Decoction or Huangqin and Shaoyao Decoction, or Xianglian Pill, or Hejian Shaoyao Decoction. If the heat is severe, large doses of Qingyin Decoction or Yincheng Decoction should be given. If these remedies do not yield results after several doses, one must consider nourishing the spleen and kidneys.</p>
<p>For dysentery accompanied by fever, it seems to belong to fire and should be treated with cooling methods. However, signs of true heat may not necessarily present with fever; instead, dysentery can harm vital essence and blood, leading to yin deficiency and water loss, resulting in heat and agitation. If there is latent fire in a weak condition, and the pulse feels strong, it is advisable to add or reduce Yin Decoction or Baoyin Decoction. If the pulse is fundamentally weak and there is purely virtual fire, fire should not be treated; one should focus on strengthening water and supplementing yin, using San Yin Decoction or Liuwei or Bawuwei Pills. If yin is strong and counteracting yang causes external heat, it is necessary to use Weiguan Decoction and Yougui Decoction.</p>
<p>When dysentery first occurs, if the vital Qi is still strong, or if it is due to overeating, leading to stagnation of food and drink, with symptoms of firm, painful fullness and both Qi and pulse being firm, one can first eliminate the accumulation, which will stop the dysentery itself. Qingqi Decoction, Shenyoupill, or Baishun Pill should be prescribed. Alternatively, using Chi Jin Dou for mild purgation can be effective, as pain diminishes with the alleviation of constipation. However, careful evaluation of these symptoms is essential before applying these treatments.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>If one assumes that diarrhea caused by deficiency and cold in the spleen and kidneys can be treated with this medicine and other cold and cooling agents, and in doing so, they further weaken the original Yang, it is likely that the situation will become irretrievable. Therefore, great caution is necessary. </p>
<p>Locking the mouth and not eating is the most dangerous symptom of diarrhea, yet it has not been clearly distinguished since ancient times. Observing what Danxi said: &quot;Locking the mouth in diarrhea is due to excessive heat in the stomach.&quot; One should take a decoction of huanglian (Coptis), and ginseng, sipping it throughout the day. If one vomits and then eats again, just a sip, swallowing it would be good. People are unaware of this and instead use warming and sweet medicines, akin to fire aiding fire, therefore worsening stagnation. </p>
<p>There are also instances where one mistakenly takes a hot and toxic medicine that offends the stomach, which should be clarified and the poison expelled. This is what Danxi referred to. The distinction of locking the mouth is very subtle; is it merely due to excessive heat in the stomach that one believes huanglian can treat it all? Locking the mouth occurs because food cannot enter. Although there may be evidence of excess heat, deficiency and cold of the spleen and stomach are more common. </p>
<p>If one locks the mouth due to food stagnation in the stomach, there will certainly be distention in the chest and abdomen, or one may experience pain. In such cases, one should resolve the stagnation and eliminate the accumulation, so when the accumulation is removed, food can enter again. This can be achieved with herbs such as Qing, Chen, Zha, and Pu. </p>
<p>If one locks the mouth due to constrained heat in the stomach, the internal organs must be quite heated, with a pulse that is rapid and strong. In this case, one should drain fire and eliminate the heat evil, allowing food to enter again, using herbs like Qin, Lian, Zhi, and Bo. In all these instances, it is the evil that accumulates within that causes the actual symptom of locking the mouth.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>However, the actual evidence is scarce; yet among those suffering from illness, when one examines their appetite, many show no signs of distension or fullness. Or upon examining the presence of heat evils, they are also found to lack true heat, only manifesting symptoms of excess outflow without inflow, leading to a daily decline in stomach energy and spirit. Since there is no distension, it is not due to accumulation; and since there is no true heat, it is not due to fire. Without accumulation and without fire, yet food cannot enter—what is the reason? It is due to the organ&#39;s inability to receive. The inability to receive arises from two causes: one is the weakness of the spleen&#39;s energy, which may result in vomiting, nausea, or aversion to food odors, leading to discomfort; or a feeling of hunger without the ability to eat, leaving the stomach empty and awaiting distress. This is because the middle burner is not functioning, thus preventing food from entering, and the responsibility lies with the spleen.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The weakness of the kidney qi causes the gate of life to be unable to warm, leading to the large intestine&#39;s inability to consolidate and the small intestine&#39;s failure to transform, thus hindering the stomach qi&#39;s movement. This indicates a loss of control in the lower jiao, and the source of transformation is ungoverned; the responsibility lies with the kidney. To strengthen the middle jiao, one must use herbs such as ginseng, white astragalus, dried ginger, and licorice. To bolster the lower jiao, one must use substances like cooked rehmannia, aconite, wuzhuyu (Evodia), and cinnamon. When the spleen and kidneys are strong, food naturally enters, and the principle is clear as it resonates like an echo. My experience in this matter cannot be overstated. Danxi&#39;s use of huanglian (coptis) and the notion of using fire to assist fire, and stagnation to increase stagnation is primarily focused on the concept of true fire, showing merely a one-sided perspective. This constrains human intelligence and life force; their interrelationship is significant and should not be treated lightly. </p>
<p>In cases of prolonged diarrhea with yang deficiency, or when excessive cold attacks lead to the depletion of the spleen and kidney essence, resulting in constant looseness, the original source is already damaged. Even if aggressive warming and tonifying medicines are administered, they will certainly be ineffective. It is advisable to promptly moxibustion the Baihui, Qihai, Tianshu, and Shenque points to revive the yang, in hopes of achieving a potential for recovery.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescription from the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Treatment Method for Dysentery</strong>  </p>
<p>When a person is affected by the heat of summer and autumn, suffering from dysentery with blood, experiencing up to a hundred or more bouts in a day, it is truly a critical situation. If one were to use cooling medicine to stop the bleeding or purging medicine to attack the evil, it would not be a good method. I have a miraculous recipe that can rescue from emergency and danger without harming the vital energy and blood, allowing the dysentery to stop while also keeping the body healthy. </p>
<p>The recipe uses the &quot;Divine Aid Pill&quot;: two taels each of white peony and angelica, two qian each of bitter orange peel, areca nut, and licorice, three qian of talc powder, one qian each of wide wood fragrant and radish seeds, boiled in water and taken as a decoction. One dose is light, two doses stop the condition, and three doses lead to complete recovery. </p>
<p>The brilliance of this recipe lies in using such a large amount of white peony and angelica at two taels, which ensures there is enough liver blood. By not depleting or overcoming the spleen and earth element, there arises an opportunity for the spleen&#39;s energy to rejuvenate, naturally allowing the large intestine to facilitate its functions. In addition, the bitter orange peel, areca nut, and radish seeds all serve as excellent medicines to eliminate impurities and remove accumulation, particularly effective in supplementary remedies combined with attack.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The substances talc, licorice, and wood incense, when harmonized between slow and fast, can effectively eliminate stagnation without causing any internal issues. For mild dysentery, such a large amount is unnecessary; halving the dosage will also yield results. There is no need to differentiate between red and white or between pain and no pain; all are effective.</p>
<p>The symptoms of dysentery often arise from the heat and humidity of summer, aggravated by atmospheric moisture from rain and dew. The discharge may appear mixed, resembling blood and pus; in severe cases, it can be as bad as leaking roofs or frozen fish, accompanied by urgency, heaviness, and pain, with a strong desire to defecate but inability to do so, or defecation without relief. It may occur dozens or even hundreds of times day and night, leaving one gasping, waiting for death.</p>
<p>If the disorder is abruptly halted, one may die instantly; if not controlled, danger remains ever-present. Attempts to replenish vital energy may worsen the evil qi, while efforts to clear heat may exacerbate the downward flow. At this moment, only a method that follows the situation can be employed. If it is suspected that one is already deficient in energy and blood, further purging will surely lead to death. It is not understood that as long as the evil qi persists, the vital qi will remain unsettled. The ancients said: &quot;There is no stopping method for dysentery,&quot; and this statement is not in vain.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>The formula includes three taels of white peony and angelica, one tael of radish seeds, and three qian each of bitter orange peel, betel nut, licorice, and plantain seeds, boiled in water and taken as a decoction. One dose is sufficient; after two doses, one is completely at ease, and can return to normal diet. The uniqueness of this formula lies in the use of white peony and angelica. Water-dampness most abhors the slippery nature of angelica, whereas dysentery favors it. Peony has a sour taste that enters the liver to pacify wood, so that it dares not invade the spleen-earth again. Additionally, there are bitter orange and betel nut to dispel damp-heat, along with plantain seeds to promote the flow of dampness without depleting true kidney yin, thus this formula is even more effective than poria. Particularly remarkable is the inclusion of radish seeds, a point often overlooked by many. Radish seeds have a spicy flavor that can dispel evils and eliminate dampness, and they also promote communication both upwards and downwards. They aid digestion and facilitate qi movement within the blood, assisting angelica and peony to generate new blood and eliminate stagnation. A little licorice is added to harmonize the formula, thus avoiding excessive potency. The remarkable efficacy of this preparation indeed contains profound principles. Blood dysentery can be differentiated by the presence or absence of abdominal pain.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>For pain, it is due to great heat. Use one tael each of Ligusticum and white peony, three qian of Coptis, two qian each of bitter orange peel and radish seed, one qian of licorice, and decoct in water for consumption. For those without pain, it is due to cold. Use three qian each of white peony and Ligusticum, two qian of radish seed, and one qian each of bitter orange peel, betel nut, and licorice, and decoct in water for consumption. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said: blood dysentery arises from the liver channel invading the spleen and earth element. Although this is due to the spleen’s dampness compounded by summer heat and concealed injury from fruits, it ultimately arises because the liver wood is too strong, overpowering the spleen earth. To remedy this, use white peony and Ligusticum to nourish the liver and subdue the wood. When the liver wood is nourished, it will not attack the spleen earth, allowing the earth to be nourished and thus curing the blood dysentery. </p>
<p>Even though blood dysentery can be categorized by pain or no pain, it essentially involves fire evils accompanied by dampness. Logically, it should be treated similarly to prescriptions for diarrhea with Atractylodes and Plantago, and must be approached with caution regarding pain or no pain. The two prescriptions may be adjusted for efficacy; there is no need to fear strict classifications, as one treats pain and the other non-pain. Fire evils with dampness dwell in the intestines and stomach; if they cannot descend promptly, they inevitably lead to urgency and heaviness. Using Ligusticum and white peony will facilitate smooth excretion, allowing fire evils to descend without cessation, while harmonizing the liver wood and aiding the spleen earth.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br><strong>Zhi Xia Men (Stagnation Under the Door)</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: when there is stagnation in the lower abdomen, focus on the Foot Taiyin meridian. The scripture states: diseases arising from the Spleen Foot Taiyin Meridian manifest as masses, diarrhea, and dysentery. One should observe the symptoms of excess and deficiency, heat and cold, and treat accordingly. For urgency and heaviness, use He Gu and Wai Guan points.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Movements</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials for Health Preservation&quot; states: for the treatment of dysentery through guided movements, clench the perineum, stand with feet together, concentrate your spirit with your gaze, hang down both fists straight, draw in your abdomen and raise your shoulders, using your mind to pull up your energy. Inhale, allowing three breaths without interruption, and direct the energy upwards to stop the diarrhea. </p>
<p>First, circulate energy to gather and consolidate it before pushing it through the Large Intestine, allowing for the flow to release heat, then draw it back and focus on the navel, seeking tranquility and waiting for the diarrhea to stabilize, supplementing energy as needed. </p>
<p>Another method is: push open the Lung Meridian, releasing through the nine bends of the Large Intestine; then rise with Kidney water to cleanse the Lung Meridian. </p>
<p>For mouth-related dysentery: push from the heart to the kidneys, envisioning Kidney water rising to the crown of the head to cleanse the heart, restoring balance in the navel and practicing the circulation method. </p>
<p>For summer heat-induced dysentery: circulate water to cleanse the Lung Meridian, then push through the nine bends of the Large Intestine; after stopping the diarrhea, focus on the navel for recovery. </p>
<p>The method of gathering energy: the Earth represents the original essence. With a focused heart, nourish in the Earth, letting all senses return to the origin; concentrate the heart for a long time, and you will feel the true essence always present, at which point you may use your mind to circulate energy.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>The method of practice involves raising the intent upwards, circulating within the processes of nature, moving from left to right. First, cultivate the dantian, gathering and releasing, releasing and then gathering again, returning to the original state. Do not stray from this, and the mind will return to the truth.</p>
<p>As for the method of circulating the whole body: first establish stability and guard the center, and once the techniques are mastered, perform circulation throughout the body to disperse stagnant energy in the limbs. The practice begins with movement at the dantian, expanding from small to large and then back to small, ascending sequentially to the Xuanzhi point, circling around the left arm, and descending to the Quqi and Neiguan points, tracing the palm and fingertips, circling the back of the wrist, ascending to the elbow, shoulder well, and Dachui, then moving down to the tailbone, and returning upward, passing over the Yuzhen, surpassing the Kunlun, above the facial area, and descending the Magpie Bridge to reach the stomach, crossing the dantian to the Yuzhu, then circulating to the right leg, passing the knee, penetrating through the Xiaolao point to the top of the foot and to the fingertips, turning at the Yongquan, rising at the heel, passing over the Yingu, connecting to the tailbone, and circling to the crown of the head. Following the descent from the Magpie Bridge, similarly send energy down the left leg as done on the right, then ascending through the Niwan and Xuanzhi on the right side, illuminating the left hand, turning over the shoulder and back, channeling through Kunlun and then down to gather yuanqi. In this way, the meridians throughout the body will become unimpeded, slowly revolving. As the mind directs, the energy naturally follows. This is the method of circulating the whole body that can also interact with nature.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Case</h3>
<p>According to the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot;: In the winter of the Gui-Mao year, in the Bai Shu household, there was an old man with a dusty face and a notably weak spirit. He had been suffering from a long-standing case of rectal prolapse, had not found relief from medicines, and was also experiencing both red and white purulent dysentery, accompanied by a feeling of urgency and heaviness in the abdomen; there was more white than red, and he could not endure the pain in search of a cure. I said: This is not due to meat and rich foods but rather from a diet high in vegetables or irregular eating habits. Though the weather is cold, his clothing remains thin; he is unable to resist and his intestines have fallen due to cold. The true qi cannot be retained, and the bodily form is not consolidated, resulting in the blood being loose and slipping. This is due to a failure of cold and slippery qi to hold firm, causing the bodily form to descend. I will use a medicinal powder made from the skin of the haritaki fruit to relieve his prolapse and eliminate the slippery condition; its slightly sour taste will help to consolidate and raise the qi. I will administer a strongly warming medicinal formula to dispel the cold and or restore yang; using qi-replenishing herbs will elevate yang, enhance qi, and provide stability.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>The text states: As I turned over fifty, I suffered from a blockage in the lower abdomen during the summer, experiencing mild pain in the belly and dark-colored excretions. There was frequent heaviness, a significant reduction in appetite, and occasional slight fever. Upon examining the pulse, it was found to be string-like and deficient, slightly rapid yet somewhat elongated, without being overly floating. Both hands had equal strength, and I observed a substantial decrease in vitality. I concluded that this was not merely a blockage but a result of worry, with heart blood deficiency and weak spleen qi. Therefore, I prescribed ginseng and atractylodes as the main ingredients, with angelica, tangerine peel as assistants, and fried ligusticum, white peony, and poria as adjuncts. Given the intense heat, I added a little coptis, and after two days, the patient was at ease.</p>
<p>As for Chief Mei, over thirty years old and well-nurtured, he suffered blockage in the lower abdomen during the summer and autumn, experiencing significant pain. Someone advised him to take single-boiled dried ginger, which alleviated the pain temporarily. However, the pain recurred shortly thereafter, and again he took the ginger, which provided relief. Consequently, he consumed three pounds of dried ginger over time. After eight days, I examined him again; the left pulse was string-like and somewhat stronger, while the right pulse was string-like yet slightly weaker. The pulse felt tense upon further inspection. I suggested that he must have overeaten and consumed excessive cold substances, hence it should be treated as a deficiency of cold. Due to the excessive intake of dried ginger, I prescribed the Four Substances Decoction omitting rehmannia, adding ginseng, atractylodes, tangerine peel, wine-red flower, poria, and peach kernel, decocted with fresh ginger juice, and after a month, he was stable.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>The wife of the Jin family was nearly forty years old. In early autumn, it was still hot, and she suffered from a stagnation below, experiencing only dull abdominal pain, which was worse at night than during the day, preventing her from sleeping entirely. Her appetite had slightly decreased, and she felt dry in her mouth without thirst. She had already taken two doses of a remedy for dysentery. Upon examination, both of her pulses were weak and irregular, and she appeared very fatigued. Her food intake was significantly reduced, so I prescribed the Four Substance Decoction, increasing the amount of white atractylodes as the main ingredient, with dried tangerine peel as an aid, and after taking a dozen doses, she felt settled.</p>
<p>Brother Zheng from Pujiang was nearly sixty years old and was a person cared for and receiving assistance. In the middle of summer, he had long suffered from stagnation below and also had overexerted himself in sexual activity. One evening, while going to the toilet, he suddenly relaxed, his eyes opened without light, he urinated involuntarily, sweated profusely, and felt as if his throat was being pulled and sawed, with very faint breathing; his pulse was large and erratic, showing no clear position, which was very alarming. I happened to be there and quickly ordered ginseng paste to be prepared, and also instructed to moxibustion at the Qihai point with moxa cones the size of a little finger—up to eighteen cones, he regained movement in his right hand; after three more cones, his lips began to move slightly. The ginseng paste was ready, and I gave him one cup. By midnight, after consuming three cups, he could move his eyes; after finishing two pounds, he was able to speak and asked for congee. After finishing five pounds, the diarrhea stopped, and with ten pounds, he felt at ease.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: An elderly man, aged seventy, had a pale face, with thin, rapid pulses; only his stomach pulse was deep and slippery. After drinking white wine, he developed dysentery, passing blood with thin pus and had abdominal pain, with difficult urination and urgency. I prescribed ginseng and atractylodes as the main ingredients, with licorice, talc, areca nut, wood incense, and common atractylodes as assistants, and gave him twenty-five pills of Baohe Wan. The next day, all symptoms had diminished, but he still had difficulty urinating, so I administered Yiyuan San, and he was stable.</p>
<p>Zhao Lidao, nearing fifty, had a weak constitution and frequently lost his temper. In July, during the intense heat of summer and amidst great hunger, his family could not quickly provide food, which led to a great anger. Two days later, he developed stagnation and had difficulty with bowel movements, feeling thirsty, so he mixed cold water with honey to drink, which provided relief, and the stagnation gradually eased over five to seven days. When I was called to examine him, the pulse was slightly stronger but not rapid. I ordered him to stop drinking honey water. When thirsty, I instructed him to drink a decoction of ginseng and white atractylodes, along with Yiyuan San, and the stagnation continued to improve. </p>
<p>After seven to eight days, he felt very fatigued and began to belch; I knew this was due to prolonged diarrhea leading to Yin deficiency, so I instructed him to continue with the previous medication. However, the stagnation had not yet ceased, and he was still drinking honey. After three days, the belching had not stopped. Many attributed this to improper medication and suggested ginger and fuzi (prepared aconite) be added. I said, &quot;Tonics do not have immediate effects; fuzi is not for nourishing Yin, and taking it could be fatal.&quot; They said, &quot;He drank a lot of cold water—could that be the cause of the cold?&quot; I replied, &quot;In such intense heat, drinking something cool isn’t the same as being cold—do not doubt too much, wait a few days; when the medicine takes effect, it will naturally stop.&quot; After another four days, the belching ceased and the bowel issues were also resolved.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>Chen Zeren was nearly seventy years old, a person of considerable substance. He had a lingering cough for a long time, which occasionally ceased. In early autumn, he suffered from a blockage in his lower abdomen, reducing his appetite significantly, leading to vomiting after five or seven days. He summoned me to examine him; his pulse was notably large, and many thought it difficult. I said: A person who is thin can still be treated. I administered a ginseng and white atractylodes decoction along with a major tonic pill to replenish his blood, and he was stable after seven days.</p>
<p>My paternal uncle, robust in both form and complexion, was suffering from intermittent fever and also dysentery. He relied on his strength and ability to eat, without any caution. One day, he called for me and said: I am healthy and able to eat, yet I have profuse sweating; can you stop this sweat? I replied: The intermittent fever is not the sweating that hinders recovery; what is concerning is your strength and ability to eat. This is not dysentery. Your stomach is hot and well-digested; the spleen is struggling with food residue, and the condition has become severe. At this time, it is wise to regulate your diet to nourish your stomach energy, minimizing exposure to wind and cold, and wait for the sweat to pass for stability. </p>
<p>He said: People say that one cannot die from dysentery while still able to eat; since I can eat, what is there to worry about? I replied: If one can eat but has dysentery, it indicates that the stomach energy is not yet affected, hence the claim of not dying. It is not about overindulging in eating without selection. Ignoring my advice, he indulged in excessive eating and also consumed fruits. After a month of this, he sought treatment, but it was too late to intervene. After another month, he passed away. The Inner Canon states that arrogance is not to be discussed in reason and is a disease that cannot be treated; how true this is!<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br>The Zhou person was robust in both body and appearance but suffered from dysentery. He had a good appetite but was easily hungry, devouring food indiscriminately for five months. I admonished him, saying: &quot;While ill, one should nourish oneself appropriately; how can you indulge in flavors that harm your body?&quot; Therefore, I advised him to eat only cooked radishes and congee, and to take fewer remedies, which led to his recovery after half a month.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Notes on Nurturing Illness,&quot; it is recorded that Emperor Xiaozong once suffered from dysentery, and despite the ineffectiveness of many doctors, De Shou was worried about him. While passing through the palace, he happened to see a small pharmacy and sent a messenger to inquire, &quot;Can you treat dysentery?&quot; The response was: &quot;It is my specialty.&quot; The messenger then brought him in to ask about the cause of the illness, and it was mentioned that he had eaten too many river crabs, leading to this ailment. He was then asked to check the pulse and diagnosed it as a type of cold dysentery. The prescribed method involved using freshly harvested lotus root segments, finely ground, to be taken with hot wine. Following this method, with the root ground finely and mixed with wine for several doses, he soon recovered. De Shou was greatly pleased and consequently gifted him the golden pestle and mortar, which have since been referred to as the &quot;Golden Pestle Mortar of Strict Defense.&quot;<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a><br>In the &quot;Correct Transmission of Medicine,&quot; it is stated: There was a man nearing fifty who suffered from dysentery for more than a month in summer and autumn. Although he took medicine, he improved only slightly; his bowel movements had stopped, yet he could not eat, going to the toilet five to six times a day and also experiencing discomfort from prolapsed rectum for another half month, with no remedy proving effective. I remembered a formula passed down from my ancestors, which involved using a turtle from a pond. Following the method, I prepared it mainly with fresh ginger and a small piece of rock sugar, avoiding salt and sauces. After cooking it thoroughly, he consumed one or two bowls. Within three days, he did not need to go to the toilet, and from then on, his large intestine was functional, and the rectum returned to normal. This condition was likely due to a deficiency in the spleen, leading to a lack of nourishment for both the lungs and the large intestine. Thus, the large intestine was unable to function properly. The turtle, categorized as a shellfish and having an element of earth, is warm and can nourish the spleen and lungs. Moreover, the lungs, having been exposed to cold due to previous treatments involving bitter and cold herbs, now required warming. Therefore, ginger, which is spicy, was used to restore the lung&#39;s metal element, and the sweetness of rock sugar was employed to fortify the spleen&#39;s earth element. Once the lung energy was sufficient, the large intestine also became robust, allowing it to regain its function. Hence, the effectiveness of this method was evident.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: My elder brother experienced stagnant bowel issues in September, having over fifty bouts each night, with vomiting and inability to keep food down. After five or six days, he additionally suffered from hiccups. By holding a small piece of clove in his mouth, the hiccups stopped immediately. However, they returned shortly after, so he took Huanglian Xiexin Decoction, adding some bamboo leaf to drink. Although the hiccups reduced, the bowel issues remained uneasy for over ten days. He then took a small amount of glutinous rice husk on an empty stomach to relieve the discomfort. During the day, he supplemented his weakness with ingredients such as ginseng, atractylodes, and dried tangerine peel. After consuming the glutinous rice husk, his hiccup sounds gradually lessened, and his bowel condition was ultimately stabilized.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: Cui Sikong, over sixty years old, suffered from dysentery with both red and white stools, experiencing urgency and a heavy feeling afterward. This was due to damp-heat stagnation, so he was treated with Shao Yao Decoction, adding two qian of Da Huang, and after one dose was reduced by half, he was cured with another full dose. However, the urgency persisted; this indicated a sinking of the spleen qi, treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi to regulate and send Xiang Lian Wan for recovery. </p>
<p>Luo Ge Shi experienced acute pain in the lower abdomen, with a desire to defecate but unable to do so, indicating deficiency and sinking of the spleen and kidney qi. Two doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Ba Wei Wan were used, leading to recovery. Such cases arise from dysentery medications damaging the original qi, resulting in limb swelling and even death, which are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Shao Zongbo visited Gu Dongjiang, who had stopped eating due to dysentery and felt abdominal pain with a downward sensation. Some used purgative medicines, resulting in swelling in both legs, reduced appetite, fatigue, irritability, thirst with a rapid pulse, which felt thin upon examination. I prescribed Liu Jun Decoction with an addition of two qian each of ginger and cinnamon, and one qian each of Wu Zhu Yu and Wu Wei, simmered until cooked and taken cold. After sleeping, all symptoms rapidly diminished; with a second dose, all symptoms completely disappeared. This condition was characterized by true internal cold and false external heat, thus treated with a warming remedy and cold drink.<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br>Judge Wang Tianxi, over sixty years old, suffered from dysentery and severe abdominal pain. He experienced thirst and was sensitive to cold, with food intake impaired. A prescription of Shao Yao Decoction was enhanced with an ounce of Da Huang, which showed some effect after four doses, but the previous prescription was continued with Da Huang reduced by half, and after several doses he recovered. Such vitality is quite rare.</p>
<p>A female patient experienced severe dysentery afterward and knew the medicinal approach. She took Shao Yao Decoction, but her condition worsened with minimal appetite, cold abdomen, and cold limbs. It was deemed a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, so she was treated with Liu Junzi Decoction augmented with Mu Xiang and Pao Jiang, and she recovered.</p>
<p>The Grand Attendant Yang Juyuan initially had food stagnation with a heavy feeling in the lower abdomen. He took Liu Junzi Decoction with Sheng Ma and Chai Hu and gradually improved. Later, he had difficulty digesting food, with loose bowels and a sense of urgency in the abdomen, making repeated visits to the latrine without success. He was treated with Sheng Yang Zhi Shi Fang and was cured. Subsequently, he experienced pain in the heart and abdomen with a lack of appetite. He was then given He Zhong Wan with a double dose of Yi Zhi Ren and soon recovered.</p>
<p>An elderly woman developed dysentery after eating due to anger, with urgency in the abdomen and a heavy feeling. This was attributed to the descent of spleen qi. She was prescribed a large dose of Liu Junzi Decoction supplemented with Fu Zi, Mu Guo, and Pao Mu Xiang each at a qian, Wu Yao at half a qian, Guo Zhi, and Wu Wei at one and a half qian each. After two doses, all symptoms subsided. However, she still felt distension in the lower abdomen, which was due to liver qi stagnation affecting the spleen. She took Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with an addition of Fu Zi and Mu Xiang at half a qian and was cured after four doses. Later, she felt a salty taste in her mouth, indicating kidney deficiency with water retention, and was treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Decoction for recovery.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a><br>My late mother, aged eighty, suffered from summer dysentery with abdominal pain, vomiting, and loss of appetite. She experienced heat and thirst, craving for soup, and found slight relief from pressing her abdomen. Her pulse was strong and forceful, indicating a deficiency of true qi and an excess of pathogenic qi. In response, I urgently administered five qian of ginseng, three qian each of white atractylodes and poria, and one qian each of dried tangerine peel, bulbus cimicifugae, aconite, and roasted licorice. After taking this remedy, she desired food and her symptoms significantly lessened; a second dose provided her with peace, demonstrating that symptoms should be prioritized over the pulse in acute illnesses. At that time, Lady Shi Ge, of the same age and exhibiting similar symptoms, specialized in treating her dysentery but ultimately failed to recover.</p>
<p>As for Ting Ping Qu Ru, after meals he returned to his room and experienced abdominal pain that seemed like dysentery but was not quite so. The next day, he had purulent blood in his stools, accompanied by restlessness and thirst, and felt mentally sluggish and fatigued. A dose of the Four Spirits Pill resulted in quick improvement. Additionally, he took Eight Flavor Pills, enhanced with five flavors, Wu youtang, bone fat, and nutmeg, and was completely cured after two doses.</p>
<p>Sima Wang Jingshan suffered from severe dysentery; after taking bitter orange peel and betel nuts, his condition worsened. He ate little and had abdominal pain. I believed his spleen and stomach were damaged, resulting in a deficiency and cold state. Thus, I used Six Gentleman Decoction with added agastache and processed ginger, and he recovered.<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a><br>Li Yi from the Ministry of Rites suffered from blood dysentery, with a swollen chest and abdomen, an urge to defecate without result, and extreme fatigue in the limbs. This was due to a weakness of spleen qi, which could not hold the blood and restore it to its source. I treated him with a formula to tonify the middle and boost qi, adding Poria and Pinellia, and he gradually recovered. Later, due to anger, the previous symptoms reappeared. The left guan pulse was string-taut and floating, and upon palpation it was weak. This indicated a deficiency of the liver that could not store the blood, so I treated him with the Six-Flavor Pill, and he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Medicine of Ancient and Modern Times&quot; states: A patient suffering from dysentery and urgency precisely matches the symptoms of the purgative syndrome. I noted that the qi pulse was weak, and although the body appeared full, the complexion was pale and yellow, indicating past overeating had damaged the stomach. I then used ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and peony in more than ten doses. After three months, his stomach qi had improved somewhat, and I prescribed two doses of the purgative decoction, and he was at ease. If one does not first tonify, although they may recover, they will still feel exhausted.</p>
<p>A patient presented with a pale complexion and a string-taut pulse, the gastric pulse being deep and slippery. After consuming white liquor, he had dysentery with clear watery pus and blood, abdominal pain, difficulty urinating, and a feeling of urgency and heaviness in the lower abdomen. I used ginseng and white atractylodes as the main herbs, with licorice, talc, cardamom, betel nut, and bitter atractylodes as assistants, brewing a decoction and administering twenty pills of Baohuan Pill. The following day, his symptoms diminished, but he still had difficulty urinating. I prescribed several doses of Yiyuan Powder, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another patient suffered from dysentery with slight abdominal pain, passing dark brown stools, feeling heavy and frequent urges to defecate, reduced appetite, and slight fever. The pulse was string-taut and thin, seemingly rapid yet long; he showed a lack of vitality. I diagnosed this as arising from worry and distress, leading to heart blood deficiency and weak spleen qi. Using ginseng and atractylodes as the main herbs, with angelica, dried tangerine peel as ministers, and chuanxiong, peony, poria, and coptis as assistants, he recovered.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a><br>&quot;The Essential Medical Texts&quot; states: Lady Sun Xiaoxiang, who suffered from dysentery for forty days, experienced dry mouth, fever, lack of appetite, abdominal bloating, and undigested food. There were those who argued that the invading heat did not harm the food. She took over thirty prescriptions of Xiang, Lian, Zhi Ke, Dou Kou, and Hou Po, but after five days of fasting, her life was in danger. When I was called to diagnose her, her pulse was large and rapid; upon palpation, it was clear that her abdominal pain subsided with pressure, and her urination was clear and smooth. This indicated that the fire was weak and could not generate earth, showing true cold internally but false heat externally. I urgently prepared a decoction of Fu Zi and Li Zhong Tang and administered it cold, leading to the relief of pain after one dose, and after six doses, her fever subsided and she was able to eat. After taking Ba Wei Wan for over twenty days, she recovered remarkably.</p>
<p>In Huaian County, the daughter of Lord Xu Tongsheng suffered from dysentery and abdominal pain, with a pulse that was weak and soft, indicative of qi deficiency unable to transform essence. Her urgency and heaviness were due to prolapse. I used Sheng Yang San Huo Tang for one dose, followed by ten doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which led to her recovery.</p>
<p>In the case of Wenxue Gu Weinan, he had dysentery for a month, with all medicines proving ineffective. I diagnosed him with both qi and blood deficiency, proposing a heavy supplementation. All medications for dysentery were halted. I prescribed ten doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang and, alongside that, twenty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi added with ginger and cinnamon, achieving a state of calm.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br>During autumn, General Zhang Qing&#39;an suffered from dysentery. He tried various remedies like Xiang, Lian, Zhi, and Pu for two months, but his condition did not improve. Upon examination, his pulse was slippery yet strong, indicating that he had lost his ability to expel. I used a combination of Xiang, Lian, Gui, Shao, Chenpi, and Zhihua, along with three qian of Dahuang, leading to a considerable expulsion of waste. His pulse remained strong, so I continued with the same prescription, considering the accumulation as substantial as fish intestines. After over ten days of treatment, he recovered.</p>
<p>The official Mao Ru initially had dysentery that presented with severe abdominal pain and gurgling sounds, leading to vomiting upon the sight of food. He had only taken Qinshi, Lian, Muxiang, Changpu, Huoxiang, Juhong, and Shaoyao. Later, someone administered Si Jun Zi Tang, which I found dubious but didn’t pursue further. He called for me at night for a diagnosis. Although his pulse was full and large, it felt weak under pressure, especially at the right wrist, where it was particularly soft. I deduced that the fire at the life gate was weak and could not generate Earth, thus he urgently needed Ren and Fu to restore Yang. Ru said: “If I only use Ren and Shu, can he recover?” I replied: “Without Gui and Fu, even with Ren and Shu, it would not benefit the illness. Moreover, the Spleen Earth is greatly deficient; deficiency requires to supplement the Mother, does it not? Thus, I prescribed five qian of Ren, one and a half qian of Fu, one qian of Paojiang, and three qian of Baizhu, administering three doses, after which vomiting ceased and he could eat congee. Further, I added Bu Zhong Yi Qi with ginger and Fu; after fourteen doses, he was able to attend to matters again.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a><br>The &quot;Remarkable Remedies&quot; states: Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty suffered from dysentery and issued an edict promising a heavy reward for anyone who could cure his illness. A practitioner named Zhang Baozang presented this remedy and was rewarded with a third-rank official position. The recipe includes half a liter of cow&#39;s milk and two qian of powdered ginger, boiled down by half and taken on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a person who suffered from dysentery, experiencing pus and blood in his stools. He suddenly saw sweet melons soaked in water and, filled with delight, ate several pieces with the skin, after which the pus and blood ceased.</p>
<p>Chen Qing&#39;s eldest son, around ten years old, suffered from severe dysentery, unable to take water or grain for several days, only able to take medicine. A person used powdered yam mixed with rice water for him, and after one dose, the dysentery became slightly better; after three doses, he craved porridge and was able to consume about half a bowl, after which his dysentery stopped and he felt at ease.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Comprehensive Treatise&quot; states: A pregnant woman experienced both malaria and dysentery simultaneously, and was treated for more than two months. The malaria subsided, but the dysentery worsened, accompanied by abdominal pain and reduced appetite, prompting me to examine her again. I said: This is a condition of deficiency and cold. I prescribed a restorative formula to boost the central qi, adding ginger and cinnamon. After one dose, the dysentery improved significantly; after a second dose, however, the malaria symptoms intensified alarmingly. The host was frightened, but I reassured them: This is a good sign. The prior cessation of malaria indicated an extreme dominance of yin, causing yang to refrain from confrontation. Now, with a tonic for yang, the yang energy is fortified enough to contend with yin, thus helping yang&#39;s strength and allowing yin to recede. I added five grams of prepared aconite to the prescription, and both malaria and dysentery were cured. After taking a large restorative dose, three months later she gave birth to a son, and she was very healthy after childbirth.</p>
<p>The &quot;Meaning in Herbs&quot; states: Zhu Kongyang, aged twenty-five, was slender and accustomed to a life of leisure. During the summer months, due to involvement in a lawsuit, he was out during the hot midday, causing internal heat from the combined effects of heat and humidity, resulting in dysentery. He experienced frequent bowel movements, one to two hundred times a day, unable to get out of bed. He laid coarse paper on his bedding, replacing it frequently, only able to drink water but unable to eat, suffering intensely with rectal pain that felt like being burned. He would flail his limbs, restless and miserable. I examined his pulse, which was tight and forceful, refusing to yield under pressure. I remarked: This condition signifies a mass of toxic fire, trapped within the intestines and stomach, burning fiercely. Immediate rescue is necessary; if delayed by two or three days, the intestines and stomach will rot away.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a><br>Then, four taels of rhubarb, two taels each of coptis and licorice were put into a large sand pot for decoction, taken while boiling, and consumed. After taking the medicine, the person was somewhat calm for a moment, but shortly thereafter, the restlessness returned for a whole day and night. After taking more than twenty bowls, the rhubarb had completely dissolved, and the coptis and licorice were boiled down to dryness. The next day, the patient again requested the previous medicine. After the diagnosis, I saw the pulse was somewhat softer and knew the illness could be cured, but I opted for an urgent method instead of urgent medicine. Thus, I changed to four taels each of raw rehmannia and ophiopogon, and separately extracted their fresh juices. I then added one tael each of powdered trichosanthes, peony bark, red peony, and licorice, and decocted them into a large bowl of harmonious fluid to drink. Because the onset was fierce, all bodily fluids had been depleted, and one must wait for the diarrhea to stop before nourishing the blood and fluids, as recovering from such depletion would take time. Now that the pulse had softened, the fiery pathogen had retreated; if one did not treat the diarrhea, it would stop on its own. How could one rely on lubricating and stagnating medicines without urgent action? After taking this medicine, indeed the diarrhea ceased completely, leaving only a little residual froth. On the third day, the patient craved tofu soup. On the fourth day, I gradually introduced clear broth from old warehouse rice. Slowly adjusting over ten days, he was eventually able to digest grains. It was also noted that the presence of stomach qi must not overlook this urgent matter at hand.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br>Chen Ruming was suffering from dysentery, with fever as if steamed, heavy and unable to eat, feeling extremely unwell. On the third day, in critical condition, he requested my diagnosis. His pulse was rapid and considerably hollow, with the pulse at the wrist being especially strong. I said: This is a case where two illnesses coincide at one time. Internally, there is damp-heat combining with the external heat of the season, wanting to manifest as dysentery, yet he remained unaware, having also engaged in excessive sexual activity, which contributed to being suddenly attacked by cold. Hence, the fever, heaviness, and inability to eat are all related to the external invasion of the Lesser Yin Kidney channel. When the Lesser Yin is affected, one should expect diarrhea of clear fluids. This is because the damp-heat in the intestines has already boiled into a foul form resembling pig liver or fish brain; thus, although the color changes, the diarrhea remains the same. If I were to administer a remedy for dysentery at this point, it would be of no help. I hastily gave him a dose of Mahuang, Fuzhu, and Xixin Decoction to dispel the external pathogen, and after sweating, his heat slightly diminished. Then, I used Fuzhu Lizhong Decoction as well, giving two doses; the heat receded, and he felt lighter and was able to eat. I switched to taking Huanglian Lizhong Pills, and by the tenth day, he was completely well.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br>Ye Maoqing, a young boy, suffered from dysentery and was instructed not to eat. He had a fever for more than ten days, with continuous vomiting. Upon examining his pulse, it was surging upward without a root; the pulse in his feet showed the same condition. I told his father: &quot;This is not a case of dysentery caused by dietary restriction; rather, it is a sign that the stomach&#39;s qi is about to fail. In dysentery from dietary restriction, there is virtual heat in the stomach, stagnating and not dispersing, hence the sensation of fullness without appetite. The treatment should focus on nourishing deficiency and clearing heat. This condition arises from the harm of bitter and cold medicines, which cannot accept food; thus, warm nourishment is the only remedy.&quot; </p>
<p>I then administered two doses of the &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; (Regulating the Center Decoction). In no time, he experienced ten or more bouts of dysentery, and the surroundings became messy. Maoqing feared that the medicine was inappropriate for his condition and requested a different prescription. I replied: &quot;My aim is to first save the qi of the stomach from failing, and I am not treating the dysentery directly. Dysentery involves the large and small intestines, which are quite distant in the body; even a miraculous pill cannot instantly change the stool. Encouraging it to come out quickly with medicine is indeed a good thing—how could that be doubted?&quot; </p>
<p>So, I continued the previous medicine for another two days. His condition greatly improved; he began to feel hungry without vomiting, and the dysentery&#39;s intensity decreased. Four days later, he only passed damp remnants. After restoring the Qi with nourishing methods and regulating his condition for ten days, he fully recovered. This illustrates that in children with dysentery, even if they have consumed food that harms the stomach, it is rare to find accumulated heat inside. Thus, it is particularly inadvisable to lightly apply the standard methods for treating dysentery.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a><br>Mr. Pu Junyi fell ill with dysentery. At first, he had an outward pathogen that had not yet dispersed, but mistakenly used ginseng and atractylodes to strengthen the exterior, allowing the pathogenic qi to penetrate deeply. He also mistakenly took huanglian to cool and resolve heat, and da huang to purge, which he did for more than a month, resulting in his stomach qi being out of order, with over a hundred watery stools in one day. One evening, he vomited three to five bowls of the yellow lotus medicine, and after vomiting two or three times, his stomach and intestines seemed to become one. The pylorus and the lower orifice were wide open without obstruction; not only did the congee and drink flow straight out, but even ginseng extract, once swallowed, rushed down immediately from the intestines. In this critical situation, various friends and relatives asked me: &quot;Is there no fear in this condition?&quot; I replied, &quot;With the medicine I’m using, there is something to rely on. Am I unaware of the severity of this illness? But there is no one else to depend on; I will temporarily calm him down while doing my best to inform his supporters.&quot; Thus, I prescribed a large dose of the Four Gentlemen Decoction, decocted with powdered red stone fat and Yu Yu grain, and continuously administered it. After taking it, the rate of diarrhea diminished slightly, but he experienced unbearable abdominal pain. Junyi said: &quot;Although I had much diarrhea before, there was no pain. After taking this medicine, the pain increased; it cannot be taken again.&quot; I replied: &quot;This is precisely the saying that when it flows, there is no pain; when there is pain, it does not flow. If it does not flow, it is dangerous; if it hurts, it is safe. Why would one not prefer to feel pain?&quot; I continued with the previous medicine. Once the condition improved significantly, I then used an increased amount of the Four Gentlemen Decoction with more than ten doses of poria to ensure complete safety.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　痢是湿热及食积，治者别赤、白、青、黄、黑五色，以属五脏。白者湿热，伤气分；赤者湿热，伤血分；赤白相杂，气血俱伤；黄者食积。治法泻肠胃之湿热，开郁结之气，消化积滞，通因通用。其初只是下，下后未愈，随证调之。痢稍久者不可下，胃虚故也。痢多属热，然亦有虚与寒者。虚者宜补，寒者宜温。年老及虚弱人不宜下。方用黄芩炒、黄连炒各五分，白芍药炒二钱。已上三药，乃痢疾之必用者。木香、枳壳炒各五分，甘草炙三分，槟榔一钱，姜水煎服。若腹痛加当归一钱五分、缩砂一钱，再加木香、芍药各五分。　　【注　按前证皆因湿热郁结，后重不利，宜用此方。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>若饮食停滞，用二陈汤加山楂送香连丸。仲景先生云：脉沉而有力者，属里实也，宜下之；沉而无力者，属里虚也，宜补之。元气虚滑者，宜温之濇之。脉滑而数者，有宿食也，当下之。脉浮大，此为虚而强下之故也。脉浮革者，因而肠鸣，当温之。下痢腹坚者，当下之。下痢谵语有燥屎，当下之。下痢，三部脉皆平，按之心下坚急，下之。下痢脉大浮弦，当自愈。下痢腹满痛为实，当下之。治者审焉。】　　若后重加滑石炒五分，再加枳壳、槟榔、芍药、条芩各五分。　　 【注　按利而便脓血者，乃气行而血止也。行血则便脓自愈，调气则后重自除。若大肠积滞，雍实而后重，法当疏导。若大肠气虚下陷而后重，法当升补。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>】　　若白痢，加白朮、白茯苓、滑石、炒陈皮各一钱。初欲下之，再加大黄五钱。兼食积，加山楂、枳实各一钱。　　 【注　按前证若腹痛后重怕按，或脉洪实，为积滞闭结，宜用此方疏通之。若腹痛后重喜按，或脉微细为阳气虚寒，宜用六君加干姜温补之。】　　若红痢，加当归、川芎、桃仁各一钱五分。初欲下之，再加大黄五钱。　　 【注　按前证若病日久，或误服疏通之药而不能愈者，当调补脾胃。大凡血证久而不愈，多因阳气虚而不能生血，或因阳气虚而不能摄血。故丹溪先生治此证久而不愈，用四君子汤以收其功。】　　若红白相杂，加川芎、当归、桃仁各一钱五分以理血，滑石、陈皮、苍朮各一钱五分以理气。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>有余食积者，加山楂、枳实以消导。　　 【注　按前证若气滞食积，湿热所致，宜用此方治之。若脾虚饮食停滞，宜用六君子送香连丸调补之。经云：脾主血，肺主气。前证乃气血俱受病也。若因脾肺血伤所致，宜用四物汤加白朮、茯苓煎送香连丸。若因脾肺气伤所致，宜用四君汤加当归、川芎煎送香连丸。】　　若白痢久，胃弱气虚，或下后未愈，去槟榔、枳壳，减芩、连、芍药各七分，加白朮一钱五分，黄芪、陈皮、茯苓各一钱，缩砂、干姜炙各五分。　　 【注　按前证若数至圊而不能便，或少有白脓者，乃土不能生金，肺与大肠气伤而下坠也。当用升麻益胃汤，举其阳气，则阴自降而二便自愈。若饮食不入，发热作渴，其势危甚，用十全大补汤；如不应，送二神丸。<a id="orig-60p" href="#trans-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>】　　若红痢久，胃弱血虚，或下后未愈，减黄芩、黄连各五分，加当归、川芎、熟地、阿胶、陈皮各一钱，白朮一钱五分。　　 【注　按前证若脾经血热下注而不愈者，用四物汤加白朮、茯苓。若脾经气虚不能统血而不愈者，用四君子加川芎、当归。若中气下陷，不能摄血而不愈者，用补中益气汤。】　　若赤黑相杂，此湿胜也。及小便赤濇短少，加木通、泽泻、茯苓各一钱，山栀仁炒五分，以分利之。　　【注　按初患湿盛而小便赤濇者，宜用前药。若病久而阳气下陷或老弱者，宜用升阳除湿防风汤。若脾土亏损，寒水来侮，先用六君子汤加姜、桂温而补之，后用补中益气汤加茯苓、半夏升而补之。<a id="orig-61p" href="#trans-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>】　　若血痢加当归、川芎、生地黄、桃仁、槐花炒各一钱；久不愈，减芩、连各七分，去槟榔、枳壳，再加阿胶珠、侧柏叶、白朮各一钱五分，干姜炒黑、陈皮各一钱。　　 【注　按前证亦有因脾气虚弱者，有因脾气下陷者，有因肝气虚弱者，有因肝血虚热者。】　　若痢已久而后重不去，此大肠坠下，去槟榔、枳壳，用条芩加升麻一钱，以升提之。　　 【注　按前证亦有因大肠气滞者，有因大肠气陷者，有因大肠血虚者，有因脾肾虚寒者。若大肠气滞坠下，宜用四君子送香连丸。若大肠气虚陷下，宜用四君子加柴胡、升麻送香连丸。若大肠血虚后重，宜用四物汤加参、朮送香连丸。东垣云：里急者，腹中不宽快也。亦有虚坐而大便不行者，皆血虚也。<a id="orig-62p" href="#trans-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>血虚，则里急后重。】　　若呕吐食不得下，加软石膏一钱五分，陈皮一钱，山栀仁炒五分，生姜六分，缓呷之，以泻胃口之热。　　 【注　按前证若脾胃素有实热，或过食厚味辛辣而暴患之，宜用此方。若胃气虚，膈气逆而作呕吐者，用六君子加生姜。若胃气虚寒，亦用前药加炮姜、木香。】　　有一样气血虚而痢者，用四物汤，加人参、白朮、陈皮、黄芩、黄连。　　 【注　按前证若脾气虚而血弱，宜用四君子汤。若胃气虚而血弱，用补中益气汤。若久病气血俱虚，宜用八珍汤。大凡此证久而不愈，或变证百出，但守前法，久之自愈。】　　有一样寒痢，用黄连、木香、芍药、酒炒当归、干姜炒、缩砂、厚朴、肉桂。<a id="orig-63p" href="#trans-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>　　 【注　按东垣先生云：前证若脉沉细而身不动作，睛不了了，饮食不下，鼻准气息者，用姜附汤。身重四肢不举者，用朮附汤。暴下无声，身冷自汗，小便自利，大便不禁，气难布息，脉微呕吐者，用浆水散。】　　若得痢而误服温热止濇之药，则虽稍久，亦宜用前法以下之，下后方调之。若得痢便用前证法下之而未应，又用前调理法治之久而不愈，此属虚寒而滑脱，可以前补虚温寒二条择用，更加龙骨、石脂、罂粟壳、乌梅肉等收濇之药。　　 【注　按前证若脾气虚寒下陷，宜用补中益气汤，如粟壳、姜、桂；如不应，急用附子。若气血虚弱，宜用十全大补汤，加附子粟壳。若命门火衰，用八味丸以补土母。若腹痛作渴饮汤，手按腹痛稍止者，俱宜温补脾胃。】<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>　　　　医学入门 【明　李梴】</p>
<p>　　　　　病因</p>
<p>　　身热口渴，溺濇，大便急痛，色赤者，为热。身凉不渴，溺清，大便顺利，色白者，为寒。但痢因于暑热者多，寒者少。然阴阳变化，赤而淡者亦寒，白而稠者亦热，必色证两参而后寒热可辨。　　血因火动，湿多成泻。火伤气分则气郁，自大肠滞下为白；火伤血分则血瘀，从小肠渗下为赤。气血俱伤，则赤白相兼。其因有外感暑湿，内伤酒面，炙煿消烁，或七情气郁，而为火之实者。有外感寒湿，内伤生冷，硬物积滞，或房欲损伤精血，而为火之虚者。皆令肠胃粘濇，久积成毒。经曰：饮食不节，起居不时者，阴受之则入五脏闭塞，下为飧泄肠癖。言湿火滞于肠中，故名滞下。又云：痢者利也，法当利下耳。　　初起发热恶寒，头疼身痛，带表证也。<a id="orig-65p" href="#trans-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>热者九味羌活汤，寒者不换金正气散。　　烦渴多暑，薷苓汤、六一散、梅蜜饮。虚者钱氏白朮散。呕吐有寒热者，属半表，柴苓汤。顽痰在膈者，芩连二陈汤加防风、桔梗芦探吐。胃火冲上者，清六丸。毒滞上攻者，平胃散加黄连、木香、槟榔。　　虚呕食少者，四君子汤加陈皮、厚朴、麦门冬、竹茹，或温六丸。日久阴虚者，八物合二陈汤加桔梗。　　呕吐全不食者，谓之噤口，胃火甚也。大虚大热，香连丸加莲肉各一半为末，米饮下。又人参四钱、姜炒黄连二钱，浓煎，终日细细呷之。如吐再服。但一呷下，咽便开。有毒熏心肺者，败毒散加莲肉、陈米，或单莲肉留心为末，每二钱陈皮煎汤下；外用大田螺入麝少许，捣碎敷脐中，以太乙膏贴之，引热下行。间有过服利药及脾胃虚者，参苓白朮散去山药加菖蒲。<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>　　　　　里急腹痛后重</p>
<p>　　火性急速传下，或化或不化，食物瘀秽欲出，而气反滞住，所以欲便不便，腹痛窘迫拘急，大肠重而下坠，甚则肛门作痛，宜木香、槟榔通气，大黄降火，芩、连解毒，归、芍和血，枳壳、陈皮行滞。经云：和血则便脓自愈，行气则后重自除。间有虚火者，参、朮、归、芎补之；寒凝者，干姜、肉桂温之。又素有积聚，偶因一脏之气未动，干犯肠胃成痢者，须察何脏相乘，以平治之。<a id="orig-67p" href="#trans-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>　　　　　辨五色</p>

<p>　　　　　总论</p>
<p>　　愚按痢之为证，多本脾肾。脾司仓廪，土为万物之母；肾主蛰藏，水为万物之元。二脏皆根本之地，投治少瘥，冤沉幽冥。究其疵误，皆寒热未明，虚实不辨也。晚近不足论，即在前贤，颇有偏僻。如《局方》与复庵例行辛热，河间与丹溪专用苦寒，何其执而不圆，相去天壤耶？夫痢起夏秋，炎蒸热郁，本乎天也；因热求凉，过吞生冷，由于人也。气壮而伤于天者，郁热居多；气弱而伤于人者，阴寒为甚。湿土寄旺四时，或从于火，则阳土有余而湿热为病，经所谓敦阜是也。或从于水，则阴土不足而寒湿为病，经所谓卑监是也。<a id="orig-73p" href="#trans-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>言热者遗寒，言寒者废热，岂非立言之过乎？至以赤为热、白为寒，亦非确论。果尔则赤白相兼者，岂真寒热同病乎？必以见证与色脉辨之，而后寒热不淆也。须知寒者必虚，热者必实。更以虚实细详之，而寒热愈明耳。胀满恶食，急痛惧按者，实也；烦渴引饮，喜冷畏热者，热也。脉强而实者，实也；脉数而滑者，热也。外此则靡非虚寒矣。而相似之际，尤当审察。如以口渴为实热是矣，不知凡系泻痢，必亡津液，液亡于下则津涸于上，安得不渴？更当以喜冷喜热分虚实也。以腹痛为实热似矣，不知痢出于脏，肠胃必伤，脓血迫肤，安得不痛？更当以痛之缓急、按之可否、脏之阴阳、腹之胀与不胀、脉之有力无力分虚实也。<a id="orig-74p" href="#trans-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>以小便之黄赤短少为实热是矣，不知水从痢去，溲必不长，液以阴亡，溺因色变，更当以便之热与不热、液之涸与不涸、色之泽与不泽分虚实也。以里急后重为实热是矣，不知气陷则仓廪不藏，阴亡则门户不闭，更当以病之新久、质之强弱、脉之盛衰分虚实也。至治法须求何邪所伤，何脏受病。如因于湿热者，去其湿热；因于积滞者，去其积滞；因于气血者，和之；新感而实者，可以通因通用；久病而虚者，可以塞因塞用。是皆常法，无待言矣。独怪世之病痢者，十有九虚，而医之治痢者，百无一补。气本下陷，而再行其气，后重不益甚乎？中本虚衰，而复攻其积，元气不愈竭乎？湿热伤血者，自宜调血。若过行推荡，血不转伤乎？津亡作渴者，自宜止泄。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>若再与渗利，津不转耗乎？世之庸工，专守痛无补法，且曰：直待痛止，方可补耳。不知因虚而痛者，愈攻则愈虚愈痛矣。此皆本末未明，但据现在者为有形之疾病，不思可虑者在无形之元气也。请以宜补之证悉言之：脉来微弱者可补；形色虚薄者可补；疾后而痢者可补；因攻而剧者可补。然而尤有至要者，则在脾肾两脏。如先泻而后痢者，脾传肾为贼邪，难疗；先痢而后泻者，肾传脾为微邪，易医。是知在脾者病浅，在肾者病深。肾为胃关，开窍于二阴，未有久痢而肾不损者，故治痢不知补肾，非其治也。凡四君、归脾、十全、补中，皆补脾虚，未尝不善。若病在火衰，土位无母，设非桂、附大补命门，以复肾阳，以救脾母，则饮食何由而进、门户何由而固、真元何由而复耶？若畏热不前，仅以参、朮补土，多致不起，大可伤矣。<a id="orig-76p" href="#trans-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>　　　　　证治</p>

<p>　　凡五色之辨，如下痢脓垢之属，无非血气所化。但白者其来浅，浮近之脂膏也；赤者其来深，由脂膏而切肤络也。下纯血者，多以血为热迫，故随溢随下，此其最深者也。若紫红紫白者，则离位稍久，其下不速而色因以变，或未及脉络，此其稍浅者也。若红白相兼者，此又其浅深皆及者也。大都纯血鲜红者多热证，以火性急速迫而下也。紫红紫白者少热证，以阴凝血败损而然也。纯白者无热证，以脏寒气薄滑而然也。然有以无红而亦因热者，此亦暴注之类，而非下痢之谓也。<a id="orig-108p" href="#trans-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>有以紫红虽多，而不可言热者，此以阴络受伤，而非暴注之比也。若辨黄黑二色，则凡黄深而秽臭者，此有热证，亦有寒证。若浅黄色淡不甚臭，而或兼腥(左食右容去口改夕)气者，此即不化之类，皆寒证也。黑而浓厚大臭者，此焦色也，多有火证。若青黑而腥薄者，此肝肾腐败之色也，犹以为热，其谬甚矣。虽五色之辨，大约如此，然痢之见血者，无非阴络受伤，即或寒或热，但伤络脉，则无不见血，故不可以见血者，必认为热也。凡临此证，当必以脉色形气病因，兼而察之。<a id="orig-109p" href="#trans-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>　　　　　论腹痛</p>
<p>　　凡泻痢腹痛，有实热者，有虚寒者。实热者，或因食积、或因火邪。但食积之痛，必多胀满坚硬，或痛而拒按，此必有所停滞，微者宜行其滞，甚者宜泻而逐之。　　火邪之痛，必有内热等证，方宜清之利之。然邪实于中者，必多气逆。故凡治痛之法，无论是火是食，皆当以行气为先，但宜察药性之寒热，择而用之可也。　　虚寒之痛，尤所当辨。盖凡泻痢之痛，多由寒气之在脏也。经曰：痛者，寒气多也。有寒故痛也。又曰：病痛者，阴也。故凡人有过食生冷，或外受寒气，即能腹痛，此可知也。寒在中者，治宜温脾；寒在下者，治宜温肾也。再若虚寒刮痛之义，则人多不知。盖元气不足于内，则虽无外受寒邪，而中气不暖，即寒证也。所以泻痢不能止，饮食不能化，而病有不能愈，正以阳虚多寒也。<a id="orig-110p" href="#trans-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>且泻痢不止，胃气既伤，膏血切肤，安能不痛？此其为痛，乃因剥及肠脏而然。是以痢因于痛，痛因于痢。故凡以寒侵腑脏，及脉络受伤，血动气滞者，皆能为痛。但察其不实不坚，或喜揉按，或喜暖熨，或胸腹如饥而不欲食，或胃脘作呕而多吞酸，但无实热等证，则总属虚寒。安得为痛必因积、痛皆实证耶？凡治虚寒之痛者，速宜温养脏气，不得再加消伐，致令痛春愈痛，滑者愈滑，必至危矣。若谓诸痛不宜补，乃待痛定然后可用，则元气日去，终无定期。尝见一医云：痢疾须过七日，方可用补。而不知六日已死。执迷不悟，愚亦甚矣。但其痛之甚者，当于温补药中，稍加木香以顺其气，或多加当归以和其血，俟痛稍减，则当去此二味。盖恐木香之耗气，当归之滑肠也。若寒在下焦而作痛者，必加吴茱萸。其或痛不至甚，则但以温补脾肾为主，渐安则痛当自止，不必治其痛也。<br>　　　　　论里急后重<a id="orig-111p" href="#trans-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p>
<p>　　凡里急后重者，病在广肠最下之处，而其病本，则不在广肠而在脾肾。凡热痢、寒痢、虚痢皆有之，不得尽以为热也。盖中焦有热则热邪下迫，中焦有寒则寒邪下迫，脾肾气虚则气陷下迫。欲治此者，但当察其所因，以治脾肾之本，则无有不愈。然病在广肠，已非食积。盖食积至此，泻则无留，而所留者，惟下陷之气，气本无形，故虽若欲出，而实无所出，无所出而又似欲出，皆气之使然耳。故河间之用芍药汤，谓行血则便自愈，调气则后重除，是固然矣。然调气之法，如气热者凉之则调，气寒者温之则调，气虚者补之则调，气陷者举之则调，必使气和，乃为调气。行血之法亦然。若但以木香、槟榔、当归、大黄行血散气之属，谓之调和，不知广肠最远，药不易达，而所行所散者，皆中焦之气耳。且气既下陷，而复以行之散之，则气必更陷，其能愈乎？矧痢止而后重自止，未有痢不愈而后重能愈者也。故凡欲治此者，但当以治痢为主。<a id="orig-112p" href="#trans-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>　　　　　论大孔肿痛</p>
<p>　　凡病痢疾，多有大孔肿痛者，其故何也？盖脾胃不和，则水谷之气，失其正化，而浊恶难堪之物，出诸孔道，此痛楚之不能免也。又若火因泻陷，阳为阴逐，则胃中阳气并逼于下，无从解散，此肿之所由生也。所以痢多则痛多，痢少则痛少。痛与不痛，亦由气之陷与不陷耳。故无论寒痢热痢，大孔皆能为痛，不得谓痛必由热也。欲治此者，但治其痢，痢止则肿痛自散，亦如后重之法也。自丹溪云：大孔痛因热流于下，木香、槟榔、芩、连加炒干姜主之。是但知火能为肿为痛，亦焉知元阳之下陷也？后人所宗，皆其法也。凡虚寒之辈，其不能堪此亦多矣。<a id="orig-113p" href="#trans-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>　　　　　论口渴</p>
<p>　　凡泻痢证必多口渴，今人但见口渴，即认为火，不知有火者固能渴，无火者亦能渴，不可不辨也。如火盛于中，则熏脾烁胃，津液耗干，故酷好冰水，多而不厌，愈凉愈快，随饮随消者，此因热而渴，治宜凉也。如口热作渴，虽欲饮水而饮不能多者，即非真火，不宜凉也。凡口虽干渴喜凉，而腹不喜凉者，是寒聚于中，而无根之火浮戴于上，此最忌寒凉者也。然渴有真渴，有似渴。真渴者必好茶饮，但以喜热喜凉，即可辨其寒热。<a id="orig-114p" href="#trans-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>似渴者，干也，非渴也。口虽干而不欲饮，则尤非热证可知。然泻痢之证，因其水泄于下，必津涸于上，故不免于渴。渴而欲饮，正以内水不足，欲得外水以相济，岂必皆因于火乎？诸如此者，必当详审其有火无火。若火有余者，自当清火；水不足者，自当滋阴矣。然气为水母，其有气虚不能生水者，不补其母，则水不能生而渴不止；土为水主，其有脾虚不能约水者，不强其主，则水不能畜而渴不止也。使能不治其渴，而治其所以渴，又何渴病之有？<a id="orig-115p" href="#trans-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>　　　　　论小水</p>

<p>　　阴阳之道，即养生治病之本，而人有不易知，以其有莫测之妙也。夫阴阳之用，欲其相济，不欲其相贼。相济者，相和也。阴中不可无阳，阳中不可无阴也。相贼者，相害也。阳贼阴则为焦枯，阴贼阳则为寂灭也。凡诸为病者，无非阴阳相贼，而有失其和耳。盖阴阳之性，阴常喜静而恶动，阳常喜暖而畏寒。及其相贼，则阴畏阳之亢，所以阴遇阳邪非枯则槁；阳畏阴之毒，所以阳逢阴寇，不走即飞，此阴阳相妒之机也。凡诸病剧而有假真疑似者，即其证也。而尤于伤寒痢疾为最。若今之患痢最甚者，多见上下皆有热证，而实非真热者，何以见之？如烦则似热非热，躁则似狂非狂，懊憹不宁，莫可名状，此非真阳证也。盖以精血败伤，火中无水，而阴失其静，故烦躁若此。又如飞者飞于上，走者走于下，飞于上则为口渴喉疮或面红身热，走于下则为孔热孔痛或便黄便血，此非实热证也。<a id="orig-117p" href="#trans-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>盖以水火相刑，阳为阴逐，而火离其位，故飞走若此。今之人但见此等证候，佥曰，察病不离形证，形证之热既已若此，而犹谓之寒，是但知外之有热，而不知内之有寒，如上下之有热，而不知中焦之有寒也。又岂知烦躁之为阴虚，而飞走之为阳虚乎？疑似之间，犹不可不辨也。且如肌表皆有热证，本当恶热而反不舍衣被，或脐腹喜暖，而宜熨宜按者，此外虽热而内则有寒也。<a id="orig-118p" href="#trans-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>又如九窍皆有热证，必喜冷饮，然有口欲寒而腹畏之，故凡寒冷下咽，则或增呕恶，或加腹痛，或噎塞不行，而反生胀闷，或口舌虽有疮痛，而反欲热汤饮者，此则上下虽热，而中焦之有寒也。此外有阳气素弱，及脉色少神，如前论等证，若止知为火，治以寒凉，其奈内本因寒，而再加以寒，则寒凉入胃，直犯中焦，是外热不相及，而中寒必更甚。故致飞者愈飞，走者愈走，雪上加霜，欲孤阳之不灭，不可得也。故凡治此者，但能引火归原，使丹田暖则火就燥，下原固则气归精，此阴阳颠倒之神理也。<a id="orig-119p" href="#trans-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>

<p>When the lesser yin prevails, it causes fullness in the abdomen, pain, and diarrhea, which is referred to as &quot;red feces.&quot; <strong>Commentary: Fullness in the abdomen and diarrhea indicates coldness in the lower body. The term &quot;red feces&quot; refers to excessive heat from the yin fire below.</strong> When the lesser yang prevails, there is pain in the lower abdomen and the stool is red and white. <strong>Commentary: This indicates heat prevailing below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Reversal</strong></p>
<p>When heat moves from the kidneys to the spleen, it produces deficiency, intestinal collapse, and leads to inevitable death. <strong>Commentary: The great yin, which corresponds to damp earth, governs Qi and cannot control water but instead suffers from the reciprocal effect of damp heat. If spleen Qi is deficient, it fails to process food and water, leading to intestinal collapse and diarrhea, thus resulting in a condition deemed incurable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Established Teaching</strong></p>
<p>The three yangs represent the utmost yang. When they accumulate, they cause shock, leading to sudden illnesses resembling violent winds, like thunder and lightning. All nine orifices become blocked, and the yang Qi overflows, causing dryness in the throat and blockage. When combined with the yin, both upper and lower bodies become unstable, resulting in mild intestinal collapse. <strong>Commentary: The utmost yang represents the peak of yang without limit, akin to a swift wind or the sudden arrival of thunder and lightning. When yang is abundant, it leads to shock. The nine orifices serve as reservoirs for water; when the moisture is depleted, excess yang Qi fills the orifices. Since the lungs and kidneys communicate with each other, an excess of yang and depletion of fluids leads to dryness in the throat and blockages. When combined with yin, it destabilizes the yin Qi in the upper and lower bodies, resulting in mild intestinal collapse and diarrhea.</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When yin and yang are deficient, there will be internal disruption leading to death.<br>(Note: The nourishment and energy of the body, such as qi and blood, stem from food and drink. The stomach is the organ of reception, while the intestines are responsible for transportation. If both yin and yang are deficient, then the fundamental source of life is lost, leading to death.)</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Evaluation of Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about dysentery with bloody stools? Qibo replied: Heat in the body results in death; cold results in survival. The Emperor asked: What about dysentery with white foam in the stools? Qibo replied: A sinking pulse indicates survival; a floating pulse indicates death. The Emperor asked: What about dysentery with pus and blood? Qibo replied: A knotted pulse indicates death; a slippery and large pulse indicates survival. The Emperor stated: For dysentery without body heat and without a knotted pulse, what should we consider? Qibo said: A slippery and large pulse indicates survival; a knotted pulse indicates death. This is based on the condition of the organs.<br>(Note: Dysentery occurs when evils accumulate in the intestines, causing abnormal excretion. Dysentery with bloody stools is due to the overflow of blood from the yin channels. White foam is caused by the cold fluids outside the intestines, while pus and blood occur when fluids and blood clash and are expelled together. Bloody stools indicate internal yin leakage, while fever indicates external yang depletion.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: When yin and yang are in deficiency, the intestines rupture and death occurs. When there is white froth at the mouth, it indicates that the yin fluids are descending; therefore, a sinking pulse is considered normal. If the pulse is floating, it signifies an outflow of the vital energy; the pulse rises, and the channels are disconnected, which is thus regarded as a sign of death. The state of suspended death indicates the cessation of the yin fluids of the foot&#39;s shaoyin. A slippery and large pulse indicates an abundance of the vital energy of the foot&#39;s shaoyin. If the body is not warm, yang has not escaped outward. If the pulse is not suspended or severed, then yin has not descended. A suspended pulse indicates that the vital energy of the yangming has already departed, leading to death. If the stomach&#39;s qi is absent, the pulse of the true organ becomes visible, which is why it is important to consider the state of the organs. If the liver reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in eighteen days. If the heart reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in nine days. If the lung reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in twelve days. If the kidney reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in seven days. If the spleen reaches the state of suspended death, death occurs in four days. A suspended pulse indicates the complete absence of the stomach&#39;s yangming qi, leaving the true organ isolated.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Great Discussion on Anomalies</h3>
<p>The spleen pulse is externally raised; it is submerged as intestinal dysentery, which self-resolves over time. The liver pulse is slightly slow and causes intestinal dysentery, making it easier to treat. The kidney pulse is slightly rapid; it is submerged and leads to blood in the stool. If the blood causes body heat, the person will die. Heart and liver involvement also leads to blood in the stool; if both organs are affected, it can be treated. The pulse that is small, submerged, and difficult indicates intestinal dysentery. If the body is hot, the person will die. If heat persists for seven days, death occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The spleen is a Yin organ, situated in the center, receiving the force of the three Yangs. When this energy presses upward, the pulse becomes externally raised, and when it depresses downward, it results in intestinal dysentery. However, the spleen represents the utmost Yin; despite being influenced by Yang heat, it self-resolves over time. If the Yang heat depletes the Yin of the organs, causing the liver’s blood and energy to leak and weaken, the pulse becomes small and slow. The liver governs blood storage, and although it suffers from Yang evil, it remains relatively easy to treat. The kidneys govern essence, serving as the source of essence and blood. With Yang heat applied, it dilutes the kidneys, leading to blood in the stool. The pulse is small due to Yin-blood damage. Heat exhausts the kidneys, thus the pulse appears submerged and rapid. When Yin and Yang are harmonious, life arises; when imbalanced, death ensues.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When blood is heated and injured, it becomes warm as a result. If the body is hot, it is due to the excess of the three Yang energies while the three Yin energies are depleted, leading to death. The heart governs the generation of blood, while the liver stores blood; therefore, when both the heart and liver are affected by the excess Yang energy, blood may flow downward as a consequence. If both organs are ill, the Yin blood is strong enough to combat the Yang pathogenic influences, which makes it a treatable condition. A weak and deep pulse indicates damage due to insufficient Yang. In cases of body heat, the Yang is abundant while the Yin is exhausted. Those who die after seven days have depleted the Yin energy of the six organs. This is a serious and persistent illness; the Yang energy converges directly with the Yin, resulting in damage to the Yin energy, hence the weak and strained pulse. </p>
<p>In the early stages, if the internal condition is acute, one might experience pain in the abdomen, severe diarrhea, sudden shock or faintness, or a dry throat and blocked airway. Although the body feels warm, the heat may be mild, with light external symptoms and an urgent internal condition. It is crucial to urgently use medicines that suppress Yang and nourish Yin to provide relief. If one sees mild heat in the body and uses light exterior-releasing medications, or applies mild harmonizing formulas due to the weak and strained pulse, after three days, it will become unmanageable.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>A rapid pulse indicates a disease in the yang channels, resulting in pus and blood in the stool. [Note: Yang heat is in the channels, hence the rapid pulse. Heat injures the blood level, hence the pus and blood in the stool. The menstrual blood descends, hence it is one generation.]</p>
<p><strong>Taiyin and Yangming Treatise</strong></p>
<p>If eating and drinking are excessive, and daily activities are irregular, the yin will be affected. When yin is affected, it enters the five organs, causing fullness and obstruction in the menstrual cycle, leading to diarrhea and eventually causing intestinal collapse. [Note: Entering the five organs refers to Taiyin&#39;s energy circulating through the three yins. If Taiyin is ill, all energies of the five organs will also become ill. If spleen energy is counterflowing, it causes distension and fullness. Taiyin is responsible for opening; if it is obstructed, the granaries cannot supply and thus cause diarrhea, which leads to intestinal collapse over time.]</p>
<p><strong>General Principles of the Six Factors</strong></p>
<p>Taiyang governs the affairs of heaven, where the four energies clash—wind and dampness fighting each other—causing the people to suffer from bloody discharges. [Note: The approaching energy is the jueyin wind wood, while the main energy of the four is Taiyin damp earth, thus the clash of wind and dampness. The bloody discharges are due to the interplay of dampness and heat.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Prescription for a Thousand Golds</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Heat-Related Diarrhea and Other Illnesses</strong>  </p>
<p>Since I began my practice, I have encountered heat-related diarrhea three times and cold-related diarrhea once, enduring more than a hundred episodes day and night, even needing to move my bed to the toilet. The suffering was that profound. Yet, those who are self-disciplined naturally find relief; thus, I know this illness is easy to treat. However, those who indulge in their desires, arrogant and self-righteous, find good medicine hard to swallow and cannot bring themselves to discipline their eating. They hope to recover by chance, only to see the severity of their condition increase, with their stomach becoming weaker and their heart&#39;s strength diminished, making it difficult to ingest food or medicine. When they cannot recover, they call the illness difficult to treat, which is a self-deception. Learners must deeply understand this principle. Yet, this illness can be improved by taking suitable remedies; one must be resolute in self-discipline in their food intake, aiming for recovery as the ultimate goal, to ensure a cure. Moreover, one must be cautious about taste; if severe, recovery can be expected regardless. Following the methods documented in the &quot;Thousand Golds,&quot; it is important to prepare an appropriate remedy. After a hundred days, a subsequent remedy should be taken within a month. Thus, one should often lament those who cannot exercise restraint, expressing this as a great lament. There are countless formulas for diarrhea from ancient to modern times, too many to record, but I will only summarize seven or eight of effective ones. Nonetheless, the broader context rests on the practitioners themselves.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is there to say? For those suffering from dysentery, taking remedies such as Zhili Wan, Wumei Wan, and Songpi San will surely lead to recovery. Similarly, if one takes the Wenspi Decoction or Jianpi Wan over a long period, how can one not be cured? Generally, there are four types of dysentery: cold, hot, gnawing, and gu poison. Cold dysentery presents as white; hot dysentery is red; gnawing dysentery is a mix of red and white, lacking regularity, with excessive sleepiness; and gu poison manifests as pure dysentery with stagnant blood. For hot dysentery, one should increase Huang Lian and remove the dried ginger; for cold dysentery, add warm medicines; for gnawing dysentery, administer medicine via rectal methods; and for gu poisoning, treat with appropriate methods. If the medicines correspond properly to the condition, and one diligently takes the remedies, how can there be anyone not recovering? </p>
<p>When administering anti-dysentery medicines, the initial dosage may be intense. If a foolish person does not understand this and stops taking the medicine, it is particularly inadvisable. As long as the medicine corresponds to the source of the illness, even if the initial reaction is strong, continued use—even if it takes several times—eventually brings understanding. However, one should never take remedies that do not correspond.</p>
<p>In general, individuals with dysentery must avoid consuming raw, cold, acidic, slippery foods, including pork, chicken, fish, oil, dairy, pastries, jerky, powder, and salt. All foods should be well-cooked and soft. One must also avoid overeating. This is essential for recovery. If rest is neglected, even the wisest will not be able to help.</p>
<p>For cases of diarrhea accompanied by a slippery and rapid pulse, if there is retained food, one should address it with appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

If there is diarrhea with a yellow, dry tongue but no thirst, and there is heat in the chest with persistent diarrhea, it is fatal. After diarrhea, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, but if the pulse returns and the hands and feet are warm at an appropriate time, there is hope; if not, it is fatal. Generally, if the six fu organs are obstructed externally, the hands and feet will feel cold, with difficulty in breathing, and the feet may become smaller. If the qi of the five zang organs is obstructed internally, there will be incontinence. In severe cases, there will be numbness in the hands and feet. A careful examination would yield a true diagnosis. This is a general outline of diarrhea conditions.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; it is said: in spring, one may be harmed by wind; in summer, by pus and blood. Usually, diarrhea is often due to stagnation. If harmed by wind in summer, there will surely be chronic diarrhea in autumn. Autumn often brings watery diarrhea, which is related to cold. One should treat accumulated cold and heat, and food stagnation with Da Huang Decoction. Strong individuals should not take more than two doses, administering them five or six days apart before proceeding with another. For those whose Bu He Tang is ineffective, one may administer a dose every three days.</p>
<p>Traditionally, to treat dysentery, the use of Jian Pi Wan has been effective. Now, for chronic cold-type dysentery, one should first use Wen Pi Tang to clear it, and then supplement with Jian Pi Wan; there has been no case in which it has not been effective.</p>
<p>The illness of dampness and malnutrition is primarily due to excessive consumption of rich and oily foods during the hot months, combined with cold, excessive sleeping.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>For persistent dysentery that transforms into white pus, with dripping discharge, while warming the spleen does not yield results, the method should be to warm the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bone marrow, and white pus is another name for bone marrow. Symptoms include a slightly dark complexion and weakened bones, indicative of kidney deficiency. One should use materials such as broken old paper, Angelica sinensis, Chen pi, dried ginger, and cinnamon. It is also advisable to use Ejiao, Angelica sinensis, green peel, red Poria, and coptis as a decoction, combined with black plum and honey. This is most effective in cleansing filth; once the accumulation is removed, the flow will naturally ease. Dysentery arises from accumulation. Accumulation refers to the piling up of matter, while stagnation refers to stagnation of qi. When matter accumulates and desires to exit, but the qi is stagnant and prevents it from doing so, one experiences a descending urgency, with bowel movements coming and going, happening more than a hundred times day and night. Regardless of the color, whether red or white, or the size of the pulse, all treatments should focus on alleviation, as without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The dysentery referred to today was known in ancient times as &quot;stagnation below.&quot; Let me explain its causes: the stomach is the organ of the spleen and serves as the sea for food and drink, nourished by the essence of vitality. The large intestine, being the organ of the lungs, is responsible for the transport and transformation of substances. When people’s eating, drinking, and daily activities are out of balance, or when they exert themselves excessively, the spleen and stomach become insufficient, and the large intestine weakens. This allows external pathogens from wind, cold, summer heat, and dampness to enter, leading to dysentery. Generally, when there is heat injury, it results in red dysentery; cold injury causes white dysentery; wind injury leads to pure discharge of clear blood; and dampness results in discharge resembling bean soup. If one drinks cold beverages and indulges in excess, leading to damage of essence and blood, it can result in chronic toxic dysentery. Even though healing can be guided by the symptoms, it is often lamented that when people initially contract this illness, they frequently resort to using poppy husks, pomegranate peels, galla chinensis, and nutmeg to stop the diarrhea.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Little do people know that dysentery is often caused by food stagnation in the intestines and stomach. If one does not first use substances like dhupa beans to eliminate this stagnation and drive out the foulness, it is rare not to face severe physical distress, leading to weakness over time. Whenever I encounter this condition, I always begin by purging the intestines and stomach, then addressing the root issue, and subsequently discerning the influences of wind, cold, heat, and dampness to determine the treatment method. Therefore, if there is heat damage resulting in redness, I cool it; if there is cold damage leading to paleness, I warm it; if there is wind damage with a pure discharge of blood, I expel it; and if there is dampness causing a discharge resembling bean curd soup, I promote its elimination. In cases of alternating cold and heat, I adjust with a mix of warmth and coolness; for chronic toxic dysentery due to injury, I detoxify to protect health. Thus, every remedy shall be effective, and all ailments shall be cured. However, one must also observe the pulse for its strength or weakness. If there is a weak, fine pulse with diarrhea, life can be sustained; but a floating, strong pulse indicates difficulty in treatment. For a condition characterized by frequent discharge of pus and blood, the pulse should be slippery and strong; if it is tense and tight, death is certain. Additionally, if the body feels cold, life is preserved; if it feels hot, death is imminent. Examining and treating according to these observations at the time of illness, one is rarely mistaken.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea is caused by pressure from the lower body, which leads to urgency and discomfort. The nature of fire is swift and capable of drying things out. When the intestines and stomach are obstructed, the process of transformation fails, resulting in diarrhea.</p>
<p>As for dysentery, it occurs when the internal organs become burdened by toxins: they congeal but do not disperse. This can happen due to exposure to cold substances, or from being exposed to cold and hot temperatures, leading to a lack of appetite that prevents digestion. Additionally, consuming excessive cold or hot foods can cause harm, or taking overly warm medicines can result in a buildup that leads to dysentery. </p>
<p>Ancient wisdom categorizes white dysentery as cold and red dysentery as hot, which is a misunderstanding. In modern times, when sores and boils first appear, and a cut releases blood, they turn into pus after several days—why then consider it hot at first and cold thereafter?</p>
<p>Shuhe mentions that excessive moisture causes the five types of diarrhea, with the intestines moving like thunder in a storm. Unwise doctors do not understand that the yellow discharge is heat, while greenish dysentery is cold. The &quot;Great Substance&quot; states that the five types of diarrhea are: watery, duck, food, moist, and slippery. These correspond to different elements: blue represents the influence of the liver wood; red, the spirit of the heart fire; and white, the energy from the lung metal in the west.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The color yellow corresponds to the earth of the spleen. The color green indicates the energy of the body, which is supported by water, manifesting as a green hue. If there is severe diarrhea accompanied by intense heat, frequent and painful straining, or if it persists and cannot be relieved by various medicines, it is necessary to purge it in order to eliminate dampness, heat, and blockages, and to promote the circulation of vital energy and fluids. It is advisable to chase away these issues while also promoting the passage of accumulated heat.</p>
<p>Diarrhea related to the organs exhibits many signs. Generally, it can be understood from the perspectives of wind, dampness, and heat, where there is more heat than cold, and excessive cold cannot sustain for long. Thus, it is said that acute diarrhea is not due to Yang, while chronic diarrhea is not due to Yin. It is stated: in spring, one should take a gentler approach; movement leads to the flourishing of the liver wood. Conversely, excessive stillness means engaging in the autumn&#39;s order, where metal can control wood. With wind energy concealed within, during the summer solstice, fire flourishes while metal departs, fire is isolated, and wood becomes vigorous, which harms the earth of the spleen. In mild cases, there may be loose stools with body heat, a rapid pulse, and food cannot be transformed; in severe cases, there may be diarrhea with thick, sticky pus and blood, all of which relate to fire.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: When there is leakage leading to pus and blood, one knows the qi is moving and the blood stops; it is appropriate to use a large dose of Da Huang Decoction, which is a heavy remedy. The Huang Qin and Shao Yao Decoction serves as a lighter remedy. When there is excess, it purges the root; wood can become empty, thus strengthening the spleen’s earth. Therefore, the classics state: If spring is harmed by wind, summer will surely result in diarrhea. This is contrary to the seasonal qi and a result of one’s own actions. If the Taiyin Spleen Meridian is affected by dampness, it can lead to watery diarrhea and a feeling of heaviness, without knowing the flavors of grains. In the spring, it is fitting to use Yi Huang Powder to replenish; in the summer, it is fitting to purge. The rules state: One should replenish, harmonize, and stop. To harmonize, there is the Shao Yao Decoction; to stop, there is the He Zi Decoction. If this persists, it may change into pus and blood. The Spleen Meridian connects to the Kidney and is referred to as a thief of evil, which makes recovery difficult. If diarrhea occurs before the slippery condition, it is called a minor evil, making recovery easier. All this is due to the Spleen’s earth being affected by dampness, a matter of Heavenly action, which even the wisest cannot escape. The mouth consumes flavors and the nose takes in qi; through the nose it enters, accumulates in the spleen, and leads to watery diarrhea.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the Jueyin channel is affected, and there is persistent diarrhea, the pulse is deep and slow, the hands and feet are cold and reversed, there is mucus and blood in the phlegm, this condition is difficult to treat; it is appropriate to use Ephedra and Xiao Xueming Decoction. The principle states that there is an external pathogen constrained within, and it should be dispelled to achieve recovery. In cases of sudden diarrhea without sound, body cold with spontaneous sweating, clear and smooth urination, and uncontrolled defecation, with difficulty in breathing and a weak pulse causing nausea, strong warming herbs should be urgently used to resolve the issue. The method states: if there is heaviness afterwards, it is appropriate to drain; if there is abdominal pain, it is appropriate to harmonize; if there is body heaviness, it is to eliminate dampness; if the pulse is wiry, it is to dispel wind. Thick and sticky pus and blood should be forced out with strong herbs. For body cold with spontaneous sweating, toxic herbs should be used to warm. When the wind pathogen is constrained within, sweating may lead to recovery. If there is watery stool, it should be warmed. Additionally, it states: for conditions on the surface, induce sweating; for those within, induce purging; for those above, induce vomiting; for those below, deplete. If there is heat on the surface, it should be cleared internally; if urination is difficult, it should be facilitated. It further mentions: those in excess should be harmonized, those in deficiency should be supported, and those in excess should be stopped. The military strategy says: evade the incoming sharpness and strike at the returning slackness. This is what this means.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is illness characterized by diarrhea and an aversion to wind and cold, it is due to the transmission of the Taiyin to the Shaoyin, where wood overcomes earth. Use dampness-removing Bai Zhu, Fu Ling to calm the spleen, and Shao Yao, Gui, and Huang Lian to break up blood. Fire evil cannot overcome water. The Taiyin channel cannot transmit to the Shaoyin, while the fire evil ascends to the lung channel, leading to dysentery producing white pus. Add Huang Lian and Dong Gui to the treatment. </p>
<p>If there is a sense of urgency in the bowels with heaviness in the rear, and the pulse is large and rapid, it indicates internal heat causing stagnation. If the pulse is floating and excessively large, one should avoid purgatives; although there is urgency and heaviness, if the pulse is deep, thin, and weak, it indicates cold evil inside with dispersed qi, which can be warmed and nourished to heal. </p>
<p>For urgency and heaviness with closed bowels, it indicates the large intestine channel&#39;s qi is not flowing. It is advisable to add Mu Xiang and Bing Lang to promote its flow. If there is diarrhea or dysentery accompanied by vomiting, it indicates disharmony in the stomach qi. For disharmony in the upper burner, treat with ginger and orange peel. For disharmony in the middle burner, use Shao Yao, Dong Gui, and Fu Ling. For disharmony in the lower burner due to cold, treat with mild heat or strong heat herbs.</p>
<p>If there is weak constipation that does not improve for a long time, there is concern that the Taiyin transmission to the Shaoyin may transform into dysentery. The Taiyin itself is considered a harmful evil, and one should first use Zhi Shi and Hou Po decoction to prevent its transformation. </p>
<p>If the limbs feel lazy and fatigued, with scanty or unobstructed urination, and difficult, heavy stool, with reduced appetite, it is advisable to regulate the stomach and eliminate dampness with Bai Zhu, Shao Yao, and Fu Ling in a decoction. The sweetness of Bai Zhu can enter the stomach and remove spleen and stomach dampness; the sour nature of Shao Yao can eliminate damp heat from the stomach; the light drainage property of Fu Ling can smooth the water pathways and eliminate dampness. These three ingredients are essential for treating dysentery and diarrhea.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

For long-standing diarrhea or sudden severe cases, it is all a result of the Taiyin channel being affected, so it must not be separated from Peony. If one is not suffering from dampness, they cannot have diarrhea; thus, White Atractylodes is essential. Therefore, the sage established a method: for diarrhea in all four seasons, within Peony and White Atractylodes, in spring add Siler, in summer add Scutellaria, in autumn add Magnolia, in winter add Cinnamon and Aconite. Additionally, one must consider external symptoms of cold and heat; if there is urgency with heaviness afterwards, one should add Rhubarb; if there is fatigue and weakness, add White Atractylodes; if there is sweating all over with a slight cold breath, add Cinnamon and Aconite to warm it; if there is heaviness afterwards, with thick, sticky pus and blood, even in midwinter, add Rhubarb to the damp medicines. Following any diarrhea, if there is slight relief but intolerable empty pain in the abdomen, this is a severe imbalance between Yin and Yang; one should take the highly effective Yao Tao powder. To treat cold accumulation diarrhea, it does not matter if it is seen in men, children, or women—whether it is red or white, or clear liquid like water and not heavy afterwards, it indicates cold. The classics state: clear and cold are both associated with cold. This results from vacuous cold coupled with accumulation, suitable for Aconite or Areca to purge it.

For great knot diarrhea, symptoms include urgency with a heavy feeling after defecation, repeated unsuccessful attempts, pain in the dorsal region, and difficulty urinating; this relates to the kidneys. In relation to the five types of diarrhea: the symptoms of the stomach, small intestine, and great knot can all be addressed with the Qingliang Yinzi to stop the diarrhea. The conditions of Jueyin and Shaoyin require separate treatments. For Jueyin symptoms, licorice is added to address the pain in the dorsal region, which is associated with the liver. The Inner Canon states that when the liver is in distress, sweet food should be consumed to ease it. The Shaoyin symptoms often involve urgency with a heavy feeling, hence the addition of rhubarb to promote expulsion, leading to relief. It also states that one should reduce the heaviness when necessary, and “what is below should be drawn out and exhausted.” There are also conditions related to the Taiyin and Yangming channels that suggest the administration of the Dachengqi decoction should be considered.

When a child experiences severe heat leading to acute fright, with the diarrhea appearing mostly blue, it indicates clear heat. If the color is yellow, it is due to excessive fire, which causes the water to decline, and the spleen&#39;s earth to flourish, hence the yellow color. Red indicates heat from the heart fire, while a deep red suggests severe heat. As for black diarrhea, it is also attributed to heat; if fire heat reaches an extreme, it consequently affects the water, rendering it black. In cases of Typhoid Yangming disease with severe heat, there may be afternoon tidal fever, and in severe cases, the person may not recognize others, feel around for clothes, or talk to themselves as if seeing ghosts; the remedy is to administer Da Chengqi Decoction. If the stool is not black, treatment is easier; if black, it is more difficult. The same principle applies to dysentery. However, to distinguish the color of dysentery for the purpose of discerning cold and heat, one should also closely observe the colors of the food and medicine consumed. In cases of children with heat, vomiting, and diarrhea, if the stool is still white due to undigested milk, one should not hastily conclude it is cold; instead, differentiate based on pulse and signs. The general principle is that diarrhea and clear, unclouded urine indicate cold, while red indicates heat.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

Generally, if grains are digested, regardless of color or other symptoms, it signifies heat. Cold diarrhea with grain digestion has never been seen, as cold prevents the digestion of grains. Moreover, if heat is excessive and rapid, the transformation becomes abnormal, and grains cannot digest, leading to diarrhea—this can also occur.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it is cold, it cannot transform food, so how can it then turn into pus? The so-called diarrhea transforming food into pus and blood is like grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables in the world; when dampness and heat are excessive, they naturally rot, break down, and turn into turbid water. Thus, when food is in the stomach, if it encounters the damp-heat evils from people, it naturally breaks down, turning into pus and blood. The heat is red, belonging to the fire of the heart. The dampness is yellow, belonging to the earth of the spleen. The dryness and stagnation is white, belonging to the metal of the lung. The scripture says: all obstructed qi belongs to the lung, indicating the transformation of dry metal. Wang Bing said: the constrained and urgent qi is used by metal. However, all diarrhea and dysentery involve dampness, and now if one speaks of dry qi, it indicates that the damp-heat is stronger within the intestines and stomach, causing heat to become stagnant, with dampness dominating, which leads to qi and fluids not being able to unfold, thus resulting in dryness in the intestines and stomach, making thirst unending.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some say: Since dysentery is a heat disease, why do we use pungent and heating medicines, and yet some recover? This is because pungent and heating medicines can open up blockages in the intestines and stomach, aiding the flow of qi and fluids, moistening the dryness, and harmonizing the qi. Therefore, those with mild cases can recover, but those with severe blockages will worsen, and their condition may lead to death. This is also true for treating severe vomiting and diarrhea. </p>
<p>In treating various forms of dysentery, it is best to use bitter and cold medicines, sometimes slightly supplemented with pungent and heating ones. Pungent and heating substances disperse and unblock, while bitter substances dry up moisture, and cold ones conquer heat, helping to restore the balance of qi. Medicines like Qian&#39;s fragrant linked pill are examples of this approach. </p>
<p>Thus, for treating dysentery, Huanglian (Coptis) and Huangbai (Phellodendron) are primary medicines, emphasizing the treatment of damp-heat diseases with strong bitterness and coldness. </p>
<p>However, the commonly used pungent and heating medicines, even poisonous substances, sometimes help treat various forms of vomiting, diarrhea, and dysentery because they effectively open up blockages. Yet, even though there may be some efficacy, they can also backfire and become toxic. </p>
<p>When using very toxic medicines, they should only be considered when no better options are available, necessitated by the situation. Fortunately, there are effective medicines that, though not always yielding results, can be beneficial without harm. Why then use highly toxic medicines and risk additional complications? The classics say: &quot;It is better to choose the small over the large, the good over the toxic.&quot; This is what is meant by that.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The scripture states: &quot;Lower abdominal pain and heat cause the excretion of white fluids.&quot; The term &quot;pain&quot; refers to stagnation. This illness does not originate from the primary channel but arises from stagnation in other channels causing this disease. The term &quot;pain&quot; can also mean a guest, signifying something that is lingering. A guest that causes heat in the lower abdomen, persisting for a long time, transforms into white through the action of metal. </p>
<p>If there is dysentery that is both red and white, the red indicates a new accumulation stemming from heart fire; the white indicates an old accumulation due to lung metal. Therefore, red and white dysentery cannot be simply categorized as hot or cold; one should only differentiate between new and old for treatment. For example, in the case of abscesses starting with red blood, followed by the emergence of white pus, how can one attribute it only to cold? Yet the patient remains unconvinced. </p>
<p>Liu Hejian often discussed this, stating that &quot;excess cold results in white,&quot; and thus recommends dried ginger and red shijinshi. While the Tao Hua pill may effectively treat dysentery, it may later lead to blood diseases. In cases of leukorrhea, directly using white peony root and dried ginger might resolve the leukorrhea, but it will inevitably cause difficulty in urination. </p>
<p>Both treatments for diarrhea and leukorrhea should avoid the sudden use of harsh and hot drying medications. Applying such drying methods will deplete internal fluids, leading to a feeling of thirst; with thirst, urination becomes difficult, and difficult urination can lead to swelling of the feet, potentially progressing to a point of no return.</p>
<p>For rectal hemorrhage, one can use the stomach-regulating Chenshi Decoction with the addition of angelica. After purging, next use the white peony and bark of phellodendron pills, as well as Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, Wuling, and Yiyuan, adjusted to take five to seven qian.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Inner Canon states: How does one treat intestinal bleeding with diarrhea? The response is: &quot;Bleeding refers to water accumulation in the intestines. If the body is hot, it leads to death; if cold, it leads to recovery. Heat causes blood and qi to deteriorate, hence death; cold preserves nourishment and life. Those who die within seven days succumb due to the effects of fire.</p>
<p>In cases of severe diarrhea with pus and blood, and persistent abdominal pain, one may use the Adjusting the Stomach and Purging Qi Decoction, adding fresh ginger and jujube for decoction; if it does not suffice, take seven to eighty pills according to one&#39;s condition to adjust and relieve. Then use long-flowing water to prepare five-argyllium powder, in amounts of five to seven qian, possibly adding light reed decoction or mixing with Aiyuan powder in similar amounts. Avoid all greasy and hot foods, and recovery will follow.</p>
<p>For diarrhea due to the small intestine, with pus and blood in urine and feces, and pain in the lower abdomen, one should use cold and gentle agents to relieve the condition. In cases of urgency with pressure and inability to defecate, begin with clear cold preparations to relieve it, then apply gentle and sweet kinds afterward. Pain in the stem area may also be treated similarly.</p>
<p>For bleeding in diarrhea characterized by pus and blood in feces, one should use Wu’er pills, Dihuang powder, Zhuchun pills, and Plantago seed, and also employ gentle or sweet medicines as needed. </p>
<p>In general, for persistent diarrhea with pus and blood and unceasing abdominal pain, what causes this? All pain and itch relate to heart fire; one may use the Tongjie pill, adjusting the dosage based on the condition, to relieve it; then use the Xiao Shi powder with fresh ginger, jujube, and peony to purge further, followed by taking the five-argyllium powder mixed with fresh water.&quot;<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

Intestinal moisture represents water and food combining with blood, pushing out like a spout from a barrel. During the long summer, when dampness and heat are at their peak, the pathogenic factors are dominant and the body&#39;s defenses are weak, leading to severe cases of intestinal moisture.

<p><strong>Dysentery</strong>  </p>
<p>Dysentery with red stools pertains to blood, while white stools pertain to qi. If there is body heat followed by heaviness and abdominal pain with blood in the stool, and if the body heat is accompanied by an external pathogen, remove ginseng from Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. The heaviness is due to accumulation and qi descending, thus both ascending and dispersing are required, suitable methods include Mu Xiang and Bing Lang pills. If not cured, use Qin Jiao, Zao Jiao Zi, and the decoction of Da Huang, Dang Gui, Tao Ren, Huang Lian, and Zhi Ke; if there is strong intestinal wind, it can be taken in pill form. Baohe Pills are also effective for heaviness caused by accumulation. After five days, do not induce purgation, as this is due to spleen and stomach deficiency. If heaviness is distressing, one should harmonize the qi using Mu Xiang or Bing Lang. For abdominal pain, it is the lung metal qi congested in the large intestine. If the condition is real, treat according to Liu&#39;s method; if deficient, use bitter herbs to disperse, then apply dysentery medicine. For qi-related issues, use qi medicines; for blood-related issues, use blood medicines. If there is heat, use Huang Qin and Shao Yao; if there is no heat with abdominal pain, consider warming herbs like ginger and cinnamon. Blood in the stool primarily relates to food accumulation and heat, or may involve the use of (stone salt). Moreover, Qing Liu Pills are effective for blood dysentery.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the initial one or two days of dysentery, the principle is to induce bowel movements; one must not hastily use agents to stop diarrhea.

If there is heat, first dispel the heat, then assess the conditions of qi, blood, and adjust the medications accordingly; do not hastily use ginseng or atractylodes.

<p>For blood dysentery that does not improve over time, it is due to yin deficiency, primarily using the Siwu Decoction. To cool and harmonize the blood, use herbs such as angelica and peach kernels. If there is persistent diarrhea with fever, it indicates yin deficiency; cold and cooling medicines must be combined with ascending and dispersing medicines, along with heated remedies.</p>
<p>For dysentery with severe abdominal pain, it is due to heat moving downward. Use herbs like nutmeg, betel nut, Coptis, and Scutellaria, as well as fried ginger. For cases of locked mouth dysentery, it is due to severe heat in the stomach.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Severe abdominal pain can be treated by warming or clearing. For long-standing cold illnesses with a submerged and weak pulse, warming is appropriate; for sudden illnesses with heat and a floating and strong pulse, clearing and nourishing is recommended. If there’s anything to expel through vomiting, sweating, or purging, it can be done.</p>
<p>In the initial stages of illness, when the vital energy is not yet depleted, it’s essential to push and promote circulation, which is the basic principle of treatment. However, if the illness has persisted and caused energy deficiency, purging is not suitable. Strong and healthy individuals in the early stages of illness should be purged, while the weak, frail, or elderly with prolonged illnesses should be nourished.</p>
<p>When purging, start with watery excrement, then move to purulent blood. This reflects the transmission from the spleen to the kidneys, indicating the difficulty of eliminating harmful pathogens. If purulent blood is expelled first and followed by watery excrement, this shows the transmission from the kidneys to the spleen, making it easier to recover from mild pathogens.</p>
<p>Diarrhea resembling bean juice indicates dampness. The spleen and stomach are the seas of water and grain, absorbing everything and often involving all four organs, leading to a mixture of the five colors; thus, the initial focus should be on unblocking and facilitating the flow.

<p>If there is an abnormal sensation of heaviness with dark blood in the accumulation and severe pain, this is indicative of stagnant blood. The method should be to crush and grind Peach kernels and Huashi to promote movement.</p>
<p>If there is thirst and dry, painful stools, this is termed heat retention, and Huangqin should be added. If there is no thirst, no fever, and a preference for warmth, this indicates cold retention, and Ganjiang should be added.</p>
<p>If there is a sensation of heaviness after the menstrual flow, this indicates qi stagnation; therefore, add one Betel nut to the previous medicine.</p>
<p>If the discomfort is in the lower abdomen with a sensation of heaviness, and in the upper abdomen with nausea and eating difficulties, this signifies unresolved toxicity and unbalanced stomach qi. One must identify whether it is due to cold (to warm) or heat (to clear), and if there is deficiency, to use Ginseng and Atractylodes for supplementation. Addressing the toxicity will help the digestion restore.</p>
<p>If there is fatigue and a feeling of insufficient qi, along with aversion to food, this indicates a concomitant deficiency. It is advisable to add Atractylodes and Angelica. If the patient is severely deficient, add Ginseng. In cases of extreme deficiency, use only Ginseng along with Chenpi for supplementation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For dysentery and abdominal pain, one must use white peony root and licorice as the primary ingredients, with angelica and white atractylodes as assistants. For those suffering from cold and pain, cinnamon should be added; for those with heat and pain, add ameliorating coptis. If one can further consult seasonal medicines according to the year and current conditions, it will enhance the treatment, which is surely more effective than simply adhering to a fixed prescription.</p>
<p>Dysentery can present with a deficiency of qi combined with cold and heat, food accumulation, wind pathogens, heat, dampness, and sinking yang qi, so the treatment must be differentiated. For light diarrhea, treat the severe dysentery. Any accumulation with abdominal heat and gripping pain should be addressed; for issues with qi, one should examine the abdomen as if it were crabs. Ultimately, one must trace the source of the disease and match it with the appropriate medicine. The main principles are to dispel wind pathogens, move stagnated qi, and open the stomach and diaphragm first. </p>
<p>Do not hastily use nutmeg, myrobalan, or white atractylodes to supplement and suppress cold pathogens; do not use grain husks or dragon bone to close and bind damp heat in the stomach and intestines. If the pathogens are supplemented, they will grow stronger, thus the condition may worsen, leading to prolonged suffering.</p>
<p>If the treatment aims to disperse, one may use stomach wind decoction, wind-dispersing white peony root decoction, divine atractylodes powder, and other similar formulas to induce sweating. </p>
<p>For accumulating pathogens, if there is dampness, one should use guiding water pills; if there is also stagnation, one can employ descending qi decoction or harmonizing pills. If there is food accumulation, use holy cake and spleen accumulation pills; for cold accumulation, apply the prescribed warming and soothing pills. If damp heat is severe, one should use clearing and brightening ointments. </p>
<p>For diagnosis, if the color is white, it indicates a qi issue; red and white signifies a disease of qi and blood; a combination of red and black relates to damp heat; and mixed shades of green suggest wind with damp and fire.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Illness of Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>The ailment of stagnation has often been misunderstood. Some in the world divide cold and heat based on red and white, recklessly using drying agents to stop it; others claim it is due to accumulation and prescribe Ba Nao pills to attack it; or they point to damp-heat and offer diuretics to relieve it. Can such one-sided errors be overlooked? According to &quot;Yuan Bing Shi,&quot; both red and white pertain to the same principle, reiterated through various explanations, yet not fully grasped.</p>
<p>If the intestines and stomach are stagnant and not functioning, the proper remedy should be cooling and harsh medicines to promote change and wash away the stagnation, rather than using toxic and heating treatments like Ba Nao. Otherwise, the stagnation may worsen, leading to severe complications. If purging and relieving do not distinguish between symptoms, mixing the signs of damp-heat with the obstruction of urination is not the correct treatment. </p>
<p>For purging involves water and grain, symbolic of dampness. Stagnation, on the other hand, consists of waste and clots, similarly manifesting damp-heat. The treatments must be distinctly different. Gentle diuretics function to scatter and facilitate the water pathways, allowing the turbulent flow to cease naturally.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

The diarrhea originating from the pathway of the large intestine has no connection with kidney energy. The substances passed can be like fish brain, like bean juice, or consist of white pus, pure blood, red or white, or a mixture of red and white; can such cases be treated like diarrhea by using mild diuretics? One must examine its root cause, which stems from the intestines and stomach daily accumulating food and drink, the excess not being entirely expelled, remaining stagnant within, causing dampness, steaming heat, and congestion that deepens over time. When the summer heat is rampant, the fire within is commanding, and the regulation of intake goes awry, it further reacts to the intense heat toxin. As autumn arrives and the yang energy begins to decline, the heat energy decreases, leading to the evaporation of accumulated substances, and thus the symptoms of stagnation and diarrhea manifest. Because of the stagnation in accumulation, it is termed &quot;stagnation below.&quot; The damp heat and accumulated stagnation, if dry in the blood aspect, appears red; if dry in the qi aspect, appears white; thus both red and white substances can result, indicating that both qi and blood have been afflicted by evils.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong><br><strong>By Luo Tianyi (Yuan Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: purulent blood is thick and sticky, all belong to fire. Taiyin governs diarrhea, and Shaoyin governs dysentery, leading to the loss of fluid through prior diarrhea. Fire causes dryness, and the kidneys dislike dryness. Residing in the lower cavity&#39;s blood area, it becomes susceptible to evil, hence the occurrence of purulent blood. However, blue and white signify cold, and red and yellow signify heat, requiring consideration of both. For treating heat, use the Solid Center Pill or Cardamom and Aromatic Mixture; for cold, use White Glue and Aromatic Powder. If there is more heat than cold, boil Wood Fragrance Paste with water. If symptoms are frequent and slippery, it is good to stop diarrhea and nourish with Zang Decoction. If the pathogenic energy has greatly receded but the righteous energy has not yet stabilized, it is necessary to provide nourishment.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding stopping diarrhea and dysentery, if the spleen and stomach are weak and unable to tolerate food, one cannot universally apply punitive medicines. If one nourishes the spleen qi, there will naturally be enough qi to take in food. The Qian family prescription, Yigong Powder, is appropriate. If one excessively craves food and injures the spleen and stomach, leading to abdominal distension and nausea, then do not stick to this principle; instead, it is advisable to use Tangerine Peel, Zhi Zhu Pill. One dose should suffice, and it should not be repeated. If food intake is regulated without causing harm, then the stomach qi will be tranquil.</p>
<p>For heat-induced diarrhea, with heat below the navel, red-yellow stools, or perhaps with intestinal debris, use Zhangjing&#39;s Huangqin Decoction. If heat toxin enters the stomach, causing bloody diarrhea, use Zhangjing’s Huanglian and Ejiao Decoction. For cold toxins resulting in diarrhea, with cold below the navel, abdominal bloating, and stools that may be yellow-white or red-black, or possibly with clear grains, use the Regulate the Center Decoction, or the Four Extremities Decoction, or the Bai Tong Decoction.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;If there is blood and pus in the urine and feces, the flow of qi causes the blood to stop.&quot; My humble observation of the text suggests that the character for urine is missing the character for turbidity. Urine refers to urination. The mention of blood with pus in the urine indicates the cause of the disease. The blood is obstructed due to stagnation of qi, leading to difficulty in both urination and defecation. The statement that qi flows and blood stops refers to the treatment method. Therefore, Hejian elucidates this idea by stating that harmonizing qi will alleviate the heaviness in the lower body and that medications such as cardamom, betel nut, and bitter orange should be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Hejian further states: &quot;When blood circulates, the discharge of pus from the bowels is self-healing; when qi is harmonized, the heaviness in the lower body is alleviated.&quot; He also states that if there is heaviness in the lower body, purgation is indicated; if there is abdominal pain, harmonization is recommended; if the body feels heavy, dampness must be expunged; if the pulse is taut, wind must be expelled; if pus and blood are thick and sticky, potent medications should be used to force them out; if the body feels cold and there is spontaneous sweating, warming medications should be administered; if wind pathogenic factors are trapped on the outside, sweating is necessary; if there is watery diarrhea resembling dysentery, warming should be applied. He also notes: &quot;If the condition is superficial, apply acupuncture; if it is internal, use purging; for conditions above, induce vomiting; and for conditions below, deplete.&quot; If there is heat on the surface of the body, it should be cleared out; if urination is turbid, it should be separated and relieved. He states, &quot;For excess, harmonize it; for deficiency, send it away; for excess, stop it.&quot; The military strategy advises evading the sharp approach and striking when the opponent is sluggish. This encapsulates the essence of the treatment.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient practices, diarrhea and dysentery were treated with similar methods, blurring the distinctions between them. However, it is not commonly understood that diarrhea is related to the spleen while dysentery is related to the kidneys. Danxi stated: if water diarrhea occurs before purulent blood, this indicates a transfer from the spleen to the kidneys, making it difficult for the evil pathogen to retreat. If purulent blood occurs before water diarrhea, this indicates a transfer from the kidneys to the spleen, allowing for easier recovery from the mild evil. These are sayings from earlier sages, meant as guidelines for later learners. Should practitioners not investigate this in detail?</p>
<p>Zhongjing treated dysentery that could be purged by using modified Chengqi Decoction. The cold nature of rhubarb has a strong drive to move, complemented by the warmth of magnolia bark, which helps in dispersing stagnant qi. Sweetness from licorice gently eases the treatment, while decoctions help cleanse the intestines and stomach, resulting in a light, refreshing feeling that halts accumulation. </p>
<p>The formula &quot;局方&quot; employs arsenic, cinnabar, and other heavy substances to form pills; their qi is fierce, and their bodies are heavy and stagnant. Even when stagnant qi has moved, if toxic qi has not yet dispersed, it is like a violent thief wielding weapons, lurking about the halls and rooms. Even if it has the power to cure illness, could it not harm the pure qi of the intestines and stomach? For those who can tolerate warmth, ginger and aconite are used for their warming effects. The formula typically uses hot medicines as the main component and cold medicines as assistance, which is acceptable for treating clear, watery diarrhea. However, for urgent interior distress and heavy sensations, what the texts refer to as being &quot;forced down,&quot; these are all caused by excessive heat. If such hot and oppressive agents are added, what else could it be but destructive?<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty – Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery, also known as &quot;stagnant diarrhea&quot; in ancient times, arises from Qi stagnation leading to accumulation, which over time becomes dysentery. The treatment must prioritize regulating Qi, hence it is said that one cannot die from dysentery without adequate intake. Dysentery should not be judged solely by its color—red or white—but rather as a manifestation of cold or heat: if the hands and feet are warm, it indicates Yang; one should first use Job&#39;s Tears Shell Drink, with Wu Ling Powder, followed by Gan Ying Pill; if the hands and feet feel cold, it indicates Yin; warm remedies must be applied, and this differentiation must be recognized.</p>
<p>For the initial onset of dysentery, regardless of whether it is red or white, characterized by urgency with frequent urges to defecate and little produced, accompanied by a return of urgency after rising, it is advisable to use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Powder with half a qian of Mu Xiang, along with Gan Ying Pill, or Su He Xiang Pill combined with Gan Ying Pill. </p>
<p>In the case of red dysentery, with bright red blood, or resembling snake or insect shapes with fresh blood, it corresponds to heat dysentery. Use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Powder with thirty black beans, Wu Ling Powder with half a qian of Mu Xiang, and a small amount of Job&#39;s Tears, along with Huang Lian Pill or Huang Lian with Ejiao Pill, or Tea Plum Pill. If the heat is severe and these medications prove ineffective, then Bai Tou Weng Decoction should be applied.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is fever with dysentery, boil Baidu San and add a pinch of Chen Cang rice. If the blood appears dark like bruising, taking cold medicine and having more excretions occurring frequently indicates it should be regarded as cold dysentery. It is advisable to use LIRI Zhong Tang or Si Jun Zi Tang, adding half a qian of nutmeg and cardamom. If dysentery arises from summer heat, the patient will sweat, have a fever, feel flush, experience vomiting and nausea, have thirst and desire to drink, suffer from internal stabbing pains, and have difficulty urinating with frequent blood stasis. In this case, it is appropriate to use Xiangru Yin with one qian of Huanglian, supplemented with Wuling San adjusted with water; if ineffective, use honey water to adjust. For dysentery caused by summer heat, with severe pain and inability to eat, use half of Liuhe Tang and Huoxiang Zhengqi San, known as Muxiang Jia San. </p>
<p>For white dysentery that resembles frozen glue or nasal mucus, this is classified as cold dysentery; first, one should drink more of a damp-dispelling decoction, adding one qian of cardamom and swallowing with Gan Ying Wan, and then proceed with LIRI Zhong Tang. There are also cases where the stool appears like the color of a dehydrated plum or waxed tea; these should also use the previously mentioned white dysentery medicine. For mixed red and white dysentery, it is advisable to use Weiling Yin with a pinch of rice for decoction and swallow with Zhucheng Wan. </p>
<p>In all cases of treating dysentery, one must first eliminate accumulated stagnation.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After several days, one can certainly use the warming methods. Regardless of whether it is a case of red or white (diarrhea), it is advisable to prepare the wood fragrance pills or wood fragrance drink, or the &quot;Real Person&#39;s Nourishing Organ Soup,&quot; or to stop medication. If white diarrhea persists severely, add cooked aconite to the nourishing soup; if red diarrhea, add a small pinch of black beans; for white diarrhea, add ten grains of dried ginger; and for red diarrhea, one can also add ten grains of yellow medicine. New cases do not require these additions; this is the way to maintain health.</p>
<p>As for forbidden food diarrhea, those who get sick immediately cannot eat, or those who cannot eat due to cold medicine or excessive medication, should not be restricted by the notion that red diarrhea cannot be treated with warm medicine. It is essential to prioritize warm eating, and it is suitable to use the middle soothing soup with half a qian of wood fragrance, or one qian of &quot;shrinking sand.&quot;</p>
<p>Resting diarrhea occurs due to premature stops in treatment, leading to stagnation, or due to recovery from diarrhea without proper care, causing intermittent symptoms. It is best to take the Four Gentleman Soup with one qian of dried tangerine peel and half a qian of wood fragrance, and swallow the retaining pills. The stagnation caused by stopping treatment has led to resting. If there is still accumulation, then use the warming medications.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Labor dysentery arises from a prolonged illness that depletes accumulated blood, leading to deficiency in the intestines and stomach, which can cause other symptoms. If there is heat in the five hearts resembling fatigue, one should use Yulian drink. Use double portions of lotus meat and white yam. After dysentery, for replenishing, it is advisable to use Four Gentlemen Decoction with an addition of one and a half qian of aged tangerine peel, which is similar to Yigong powder. For those who dislike sweetness, one can use Pingwei powder with a half qian each of ginseng and poria.</p>
<p>For various severe conditions, if there is persistent discharge of pus and blood, or if the color resembles that of a dead pig’s liver, or there is a mix of five colors in the discharge, often occurring without restraint, it resembles dysentery, commonly referred to as &quot;scraping the intestines.&quot; This indicates a general emptiness of the viscera, with the spleen’s energy on the verge of collapse, causing the intestines and stomach to descend. If dysentery medicines are administered, it would be a mistake. Liu Zhu drink should be used for stabilization, which might offer a slim chance of recovery.</p>
<p>Post-dysentery wind occurs due to deficiency following the dysentery, improper regulation, excessive activity, sexual exhaustion, or invasion of external pathogens, leading to weakness and soreness in the legs, possibly developing into wind dysentery. Use Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction with four pounds of tiger bone pills, or use Da Fang Feng Decoction, or often use fresh camphor, known colloquially as &quot;Kuson ginger,&quot; mixing one-third together to extract the juice, taken with wine, and externally using Eucommia, Achyranthes, cedar wood joints, angelica, rhizome of Nanjing star, and grass fragrant to decoct, then using the steam for washing.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

The classic text states: &quot;Lesser Yang governs heaven; when the guest (malady) prevails greatly, the downward white stagnates in blood.&quot; The movement of luck in red and white has three types: the first pertains to fire. The classic text states: &quot;Lesser Yang governs heaven; when fire overwhelms, the people suffer from red and white fluid losses.&quot; It also says: &quot;Lesser Yang is in the spring; when fire overwhelms, the people suffer from red and white fluid losses, pain in the lower abdomen, and discharge in red and white.&quot; The treatment is with sweet and clear substances.</p>
<p>The second pertains to wind. The classic text states: &quot;When the condition of Jueyin prevails, the intestines grumble and there is diarrhea; pain occurs in the lower abdomen along with discharge in red and white.&quot; The treatment is also with sweet and clear substances.</p>
<p>The third pertains to wind and dampness. The classic text states: &quot;When the condition of Taiyang governs heaven, and the four qi are in conflict, the people suffer from discharge in red and white.&quot; </p>
<p>For the movement of luck characterized by urgency and heaviness, there are two types: the first is dampness that aids the spleen, resulting in heaviness. The classic text states: &quot;When Taiyin prevails, the lower abdomen is full, the waist feels heavy, and there is strong internal discomfort, leading to good discharge and diarrhea.&quot;</p>
<p>The second is wind attacking the weak spleen, leading to heaviness. The classic text states: &quot;Jueyin governs heaven; when wind overwhelms, the people suffer from diarrhea, water retention, and a sense of heaviness.&quot; Heaviness refers to the sensation of burdensome weight. </p>
<p>In cases of dysentery with internal wind evil causing contraction, the symptoms are incessant diarrhea, a deep and slow pulse, reverse circulation in the hands and feet, weak throat function, or the presence of sputum mixed with pus and blood, which is difficult to treat. It is advisable to use Ma Huang Sheng Ma Decoction or Xiao Xu Ming Decoction to resolve it. The principle states: &quot;With external evil constricted internally, one must disperse the evil to the limbs and distribute it through the vessels; if the external evil is eliminated, the organs will be at peace.&quot; If there is food accumulation, add five qian of Zhi Shi. If wine leads to diarrhea, this indicates heat; add five qian of Huang Qin.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Collection of Medical Texts from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 260</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery is caused by damp-heat and food accumulation. The treatment should differentiate between the five colors: red, white, blue, yellow, and black, corresponding to the five organs. The white color is associated with damp-heat, harming the Qi; red is also damp-heat, harming the blood; a mixture of red and white harms both Qi and blood; yellow is due to food accumulation. The treatment method involves expelling the damp-heat from the intestines and stomach, relieving obstructed Qi, digesting the food stagnation, and ensuring unobstructed passages.</p>
<p>Initially, only diarrhea is present. If there&#39;s no recovery after the initial treatment, adjust based on symptoms. If dysentery persists for a long time, avoid laxatives due to a deficiency in the stomach. Dysentery is mostly associated with heat, but there can also be deficient or cold types. For deficiency, tonifying methods should be used; for cold, warming methods are preferable. Elderly or weak individuals should not take laxatives.</p>
<p>The formula includes five fen (a measurement) of fried Scutellaria (Huangqin), five fen of fried Coptis (Huanglian), and two qian (another measurement) of fried White Peony (Baishao). These three herbs are essential for treating dysentery. Add five fen of fried Aquilaria (Muxiang), five fen of fried Bitter Orange (Zhike), three fen of roasted Licorice (Gancao), and one qian of Areca Nut (Binglang), boiled with ginger water for consumption. If abdominal pain increases, add one qian and five fen of Angelica (Danggui) and one qian of Sand Ginger (Shuansha), and further add five fen each of Aquilaria and White Peony.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The preceding symptoms are all due to damp-heat accumulation; if the condition worsens, this formula is advisable.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is stagnation in food intake, use Erchen Decoction with hawthorn to send off the fragrant lotus pill. Master Zhongjing says: If the pulse is deep and strong, it indicates fullness in the interior, and purgation is appropriate; if the pulse is deep and weak, it indicates deficiency in the interior, and supplementation is needed. If the vital energy is deficient and slippery, it should be warmed and nourished. If the pulse is slippery and rapid, it indicates retained food, and purgation should be done. If the pulse is floating and large, this is due to deficiency yet strong purgation is required. If the pulse is floating and leathery, accompanied by intestinal sounds, it should be warmed. If there is purging diarrhea with a hardened abdomen, it should be purged. If there is purging diarrhea with delirium and dry stools, it should also be purged. In purging diarrhea, if all three pulse positions are flat, pressing it reveals hardness and urgency in the heart area, purgation should be performed. If the pulse of purging diarrhea is large, floating, and taut, it will resolve on its own. If there is purging diarrhea with fullness and pain in the abdomen indicating fullness, purgation is required. The practitioner must be diligent. </p>
<p>If there is heaviness combined with slippery symptoms, add five parts of fried talc, with five parts each of bitter orange peel, betel nut, peony, and rhizome of sweetflag. </p>
<p>Note: If there is a discharge of pus and blood, it indicates the flow of qi while the blood is stagnant. When blood flows, the discharge of pus will resolve itself; regulating qi will eliminate the heaviness. If there is stagnation in the large intestine, with fullness and heaviness, the method should be to discharge. If the qi of the large intestine is deficient and sinking, causing heaviness, the method should be to raise and supplement.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>If there is fever, thirst, dark and urgent urination, and painful and red stools, it is due to heat. If the body is cool and not thirsty, with clear urination and smooth, white stools, it is due to cold. However, dysentery is often caused by summer heat, while colder cases are less common. Nonetheless, due to the changes between yin and yang, if the color is red but light, it may also indicate cold; if it is white but thick, it may indicate heat. One must consider both the color and symptoms to distinguish between cold and heat. </p>
<p>Blood is affected by fire, and excess dampness can cause diarrhea. When fire injures the qi aspect, it leads to qi stagnation, resulting in white stools from the lower intestines; when fire injures the blood aspect, it causes blood stasis, leading to red stools from the small intestine. If both qi and blood are harmed, there will be a combination of red and white symptoms. The causes may include external factors of summer heat and dampness, internal injuries from alcoholic intake, excessive cooking or roasting, or emotional stress leading to tangible fire situations. </p>
<p>There may also be external factors of cold and dampness, internal injuries from cold substances, physical blockage of hard materials, or excessive sexual activity harming essence and blood, resulting in an empty fire state. All of these can lead to dampness and stagnation in the intestines, accumulating and forming toxins over time. The classics state: irregular diet and untimely rest lead to obstruction in the five organs through yin, resulting in diarrhea and intestinal issues. This indicates that damp heat is stagnant in the intestines, hence termed stagnation downward. Furthermore, it is stated that dysentery refers to diarrhea, thus it should be treated with purgation. Initially, one may experience fever, aversion to cold, headache, and body aches, which represent exterior symptoms.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those with heat, use the Nine-Flavor Qiang Huo Decoction; for those with cold, the Jin Zheng Qi Powder should not be exchanged. For vexation and thirst caused by heat, use the Ru Ling Decoction, Liu Yi Powder, or Mei Mi Drink. For deficiency, use the Qian Family White Atractylodes Powder. For vomiting with both cold and heat, it belongs to the half exterior; use the Chai Ling Decoction.

For those poisoned and affecting the heart and lungs, use the Bai Du San with lotus seeds and aged rice or simply use lotus seeds, ground into powder; with every two qian of Chen Pi, decoct and drink. Externally, take a large field snail, mix in a little musk, crush it and apply it to the navel, then paste with Tai Yi ointment to draw down the heat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Urgent Abdominal Pain with Heaviness in the Rectum</strong></p>
<p>Fire moves quickly downward, sometimes dissolving or not dissolving. When food stagnates and desires to exit, the qi instead becomes trapped, leading to the urge to defecate without success, causing abdominal pain that is urgent and constricted, and a feeling of heaviness and dragging in the lower intestines. In severe cases, there may be pain at the anus. One should use musk and areca nut to help move qi, rhubarb to descend fire, Scutellaria and Coptis to resolve toxicity, and Angelica and peony to harmonize the blood, while bitter orange and aged tangerine peel help to move stagnation. The classic states: &quot;Harmonizing the blood allows pus to heal on its own, and moving qi helps alleviate heaviness in the rectum.&quot; If there is an underlying virtual fire, ginseng, atractylodes, angelica, and chuanxiong should be used to nourish it; if there is cold congealing, dried ginger and cinnamon should be used to warm it. Additionally, if there are existing accumulations, it is crucial to discern which organ’s qi is not functioning, potentially leading to dysentery due to disturbance of the intestines and stomach, in order to address it appropriately.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiating the Five Colors</strong></p>
<p>A pure red that is excessively hot indicates summer heat; for mild cases, use Huangqin Decoction, and for severe cases, use Daoshi Decoction. If it persists, use Huanglian Ejiao Decoction. A hot accumulation with purple-black color suggests blood stasis. For unusual abdominal pain and a feeling of heaviness afterward, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction. If due to mistakenly using heat treatment causing blood stasis, use Xijiao Dihuang Decoction with added Huanglian and Dahuang, or Jiawei Qingliu Pills; for long-standing cases, use Dihu San, Dankushen Pills, or Huanglian Ejiao Pills. It is important to note that all dysentery involves blood stasis, and only black indicates severe stasis. </p>
<p>Cold dysentery appears white like duck droppings, with intestinal sounds and slight pain or descent; use Weichang Zhengqi Powder, adding Wumei, Chenmi, or cooked Liujisan. If the limbs are cold and the stool is clear, use G姜 Fu Decoction or Lizhong Decoction. For long-standing cases, use Huanglian Bujung Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of damp dysentery accompanied by abdominal distension and a heavy body feeling, with liquid resembling bean juice or mixed red-black and turbid colors, it is a dangerous condition. Use Danggui Huo Xue San, Shengyang Chushi Fang, Shengyang Yigui Tang, Chushi Tang, Zhuling Decoction, or Wujidan Pills. </p>
<p>For wind dysentery with aversion to wind, nasal congestion, body aches, presenting as blue or pure blue watery stool, use Gancang Fang or Shenzhusan. If the color is blue with white, it indicates wind-cold; use Wujisan; if it has red, use Weifeng Decoction. For mixed blue-green colors, this pertains to wind-fire-dampness, and if all five colors are present, it signifies food accumulation in the spleen and stomach, along with the conjunction of the four energies; use Gu Yulian Pills to remedy this. </p>
<p>The aforementioned external-causation dysentery resembles epidemic dysentery in similarity among young and old and is named epidemic dysentery.

If sexual exhaustion has harmed the essence and blood, causing toxicity, use Shenqi Pills. For consumption accompanied by diarrhea, use Xianglian Zhuduan Pills. In cases where diarrhea persists and pain does not diminish, especially with a tendency to sit and strain for a long time without recovery, this is a sign of deficient yin and blood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>The general principle involves understanding common symptoms. Sweating and purging are also considered part of this approach. Initially, if the original energy is strong, treatment can proceed. However, if after five to seven days the spleen and stomach are weak, one should focus on harmonizing and resolving issues, promoting urination, and eliminating food stagnation, as there can be no dysentery without accumulation.</p>
<p>If the condition persists, medicines that invigorate Qi and blood may be added, such as Angelica, Bupleurum, Ledebouriella, and Atractylodes to elevate the energy. If symptoms are severe, one may use buckwheat husk, nutmeg, dragon bone, oyster shell, and chebula to consolidate and constrict. For those with reduced appetite, it is essential to specially adjust the spleen and stomach, as advancing food intake allows for natural harmonization of Qi and blood, since dysentery fundamentally relies on stomach Qi.</p>
<p>If there is urgency with abdominal pain but no exterior signs, one should facilitate bowel movement. For a weak spleen that resists purging, one may either harmonize or directly uplift. If Qi sinks and symptoms resemble severe diarrhea, one should temporarily stop purging. If there is severe pain with slippery discharge, it indicates excess phlegm and heat, which should be treated with purging or uplifting methods. If phlegm is dissipated and heat is lowered, the large intestine will naturally consolidate; medical decisions should be based on pulse diagnostics.</p>
<h3>After Recovery</h3>
<p>After recovering from dysentery, treatments such as Sanbai Decoction, Liushen Pills, Zhi Zhuru Pills, and Taihe Soup are recommended. If there is swelling in the hands and feet or pain in the joints, it indicates residual blood stasis in the meridians, so purely using wind-dispelling remedies is not advisable. For cases resembling &quot;crane knee wind,&quot; one may use Dahuangfeng Decoction or Wujijiaojia San; for slender legs, Canggui Pills may be prescribed.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Differentiating Similarities</h3>
<p>Similar to dysentery but not dysentery, there are symptoms of imbalance between cold and heat. Sometimes heat accumulates internally and is counteracted with cold substances and remedies, or cold accumulates internally and is countered with heat medicines and foods, leading to diarrhea caused by the clash of heat and cold. Whether it is dry or loose stools, with urgency and heaviness in the abdomen, the treatments include Wujici Pills or Xianglian Pills, or Lizhong Decoction with added Huanglian and Muxiang.</p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>I perceive that dysentery often originates from issues with the spleen and kidneys. The spleen manages storage, and earth is the mother of all things; the kidneys govern storage, and water is the source of all things. Both organs are fundamental, and if treatment is insufficient, it leads to a deepening of the ailment. The root of the error lies in the unclear distinction between cold and heat, and between deficiency and excess. In recent discussions, there has been little to elaborate on, even in the works of ancient masters, which exhibit considerable bias. For instance, the &quot;Jufang&quot; and Fuan favor pungent and hot treatments, while Hejian and Danxi prefer bitter and cold remedies, showing a rigid adherence rather than a rounded understanding—how vastly different this is! Dysentery arises in the summer and autumn, associated with the heat of the season; seeking coolness leads to the excessive consumption of raw and cold items, which is due to human behavior. When one’s vitality is strong, it primarily results in heat accumulation from climatic factors; when weak, it results in excess cold caused by personal factors. The damp earth thrives in all seasons; if it derives from fire, there is an abundance of yang earth leading to damp heat as a disease, referred to as “Dunfu” in the classics. If it derives from water, there is a deficiency in yin earth leading to cold damp as a disease, referred to as “Bijian” in the classics.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To speak of heat is to dismiss cold; to speak of cold is to neglect heat. Is this not an error in expression? Furthermore, to equate red with heat and white with cold is also not a definitive assertion. If red and white are both present, can it be said that they truly suffer from the same conditions of cold and heat? One must differentiate between them using evidence and the observation of color and pulse, and only then can cold and heat be clearly understood. It is essential to know that cold must be associated with deficiency, while heat must be associated with fullness. By detailing this deficiency and fullness, the distinction between cold and heat becomes clearer. A feeling of fullness, aversion to food, urgent pain, and fear of pressure indicate fullness; thirst that prompts drinking, a preference for coolness, and aversion to heat indicate heat. A strong and firm pulse indicates fullness; a rapid and slippery pulse indicates heat. Beyond this, everything else is surely cold and deficient. In cases of similarity, one should be particularly careful in observation. For instance, if one interprets thirst as a sign of true heat, they might not realize that in cases of diarrhea, there is a loss of bodily fluids; as fluids are depleted below, dryness occurs above. How can one not feel thirsty? Furthermore, one must differentiate between a preference for coolness and a preference for heat to understand deficiency and fullness. To consider abdominal pain as true heat might seem plausible, yet one may be unaware that dysentery originates from the organs, harming the intestines and stomach, with pus and blood pressing against the skin. How can there be no pain? One must further distinguish between the severity or urgency of the pain, whether pressure alleviates or exacerbates it, the yin and yang of the organs, the presence or absence of abdominal distension, and the strength or weakness of the pulse to ascertain deficiency and fullness.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The yellowish-red color and the short quantity of urine indicate actual heat; however, one should understand that if fluid is lost through dysentery, urination must be lessened. When yin is depleted, the color changes. It is also essential to differentiate between the heat or lack of heat in the urine, the depletion or not of fluids, and the luster or lack thereof in color to discern between deficiency and excess. </p>
<p>The urgency and heaviness in the abdomen indicate actual heat; nevertheless, if the qi is suppressed, then the storehouse cannot hold, and if yin is lost, then the gates do not close. It is also necessary to differentiate between the new or chronic nature of the disease, the strength or weakness of the condition, and the vigor or decline of the pulse to discern between deficiency and excess.</p>
<p>In treatment, one must identify what pathogen has caused the damage and which organ is affected. If it is due to damp-heat, remove the damp-heat; if due to accumulation and stagnation, remove the accumulation; if related to qi and blood, harmonize them. New illnesses that are strong can be treated with common methods, while chronic illnesses that are deficient require different approaches. </p>
<p>These are all standard methods and need no further explanation. It is particularly puzzling that among those suffering dysentery, nineteen out of ten have a deficiency, yet physicians treating dysentery rarely provide any supplementation. If the qi is inherently sinking and one continues to move the qi, does not the heaviness worsen? If the center is fundamentally deficient and weak, does attacking the accumulation not deplete the vital energy even further? </p>
<p>When damp-heat injures the blood, one should naturally regulate the blood. If one pushes too hard, does it not further injure the blood? When fluids are exhausted, leading to thirst, one should stop the diarrhea.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we continue with infiltration of profits, will the essence not be wasted? The common practitioners of this world adhere strictly to the pain without remedy, claiming: &quot;Only when the pain stops can one seek to remedy it.&quot; They do not know that pain caused by emptiness only worsens with more attacks, leading to greater emptiness and pain. This stems from a lack of clarity on fundamental and peripheral issues; they only regard present ailments as tangible diseases, neglecting the intangible concerns of vital energy. </p>
<p>Let me state the necessary proofs for supplementation: a weak pulse can be supplemented; a frail appearance can be supplemented; post-disease diarrhea can be supplemented; severe cases arising from excessive interventions can be supplemented. However, what is most crucial lies within the spleen and kidney organs. If diarrhea occurs before dysentery, the spleen contributes to the kidney, leading to malevolent influences, which are hard to treat; if dysentery precedes diarrhea, the kidney transmits minor issues to the spleen, which are easier to heal. Therefore, diseases in the spleen are superficial, while those in the kidney are deep. The kidney is the gate of the stomach, opening to the two yin regions; there has never been a case of prolonged dysentery without harming the kidney. Thus, treating dysentery without supplementing the kidney is not a proper treatment. </p>
<p>All the Four Gentlemen (Si Jun Zi), Gui Pi, Shi Quan, and Bu Zhong formulas supplement spleen deficiency and are indeed beneficial. However, if the disease arises from diminished fire and the earth lacks a mother, unless we use cinnamon or aconite to significantly replenish the kidney yang and restore the spleen&#39;s maternal role, how can nourishment be received, how can the pathways be secured, and how can true essence be restored? If one fears heat and does not advance, merely supplementing the earth with ginseng and atractylodes can lead to grave consequences and significant harm.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Stagnation and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, red was considered hot, and white cold. Liu Hejian and Li Dongyuan first disputed this. Liu claimed that all forms of dysentery arise from heat, associating red with the heart&#39;s fire, yellow with the spleen&#39;s earth, white with the lung&#39;s metal, green with the liver&#39;s wood, and black as the extreme of heat, also converging with the kidney&#39;s water transformation. All forms of diarrhea are intertwined with warmth, and dampness leads to a sensation of fullness, causing qi to be unable to circulate freely. Excessive damp heat within the intestines and stomach results in a dryness of these organs, leading to frequent urges to defecate along with a feeling of heaviness, and red, painful urination. He indicated that to treat all types of dysentery, bitter cold medicines should be used, possibly with a slight addition of a warming element. Bitterness can dry dampness, while cold can suppress heat, allowing for the smooth circulation of qi. If blood flows properly, rectal bleeding will self-heal; regulating qi will alleviate feelings of heaviness. </p>
<p>Li&#39;s approach, starting from spleen and stomach conditions, stated that upward disturbances in the lungs present as white, while downward transmissions to the yin manifest as red. The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; asserts that the Taiyin governs diarrhea, which presents in the Shaoyin as dysentery. This occurs as a result of the loss of bodily fluids and subsequent heat leading to dryness. The kidneys dislike dryness, residing in the lower abdominal blood division, thus leading to pus and blood in the stool for those affected. Nevertheless, red and yellow indicate heat, while green and white signify cold. Danxi said that dysentery from stagnation is due to the heat pressing down, causing the sensation of fullness and heaviness. Therefore, one should use Liu&#39;s methods for treating damp heat and Li&#39;s for preserving the spleen’s earth, further assessing the balance of qi and blood to determine the appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The three schools all express what previous generations have not, and they highlight the essentials. I have often studied this. From the perspective that the five colors correspond to the five organs, one can see that within the dampness and heat, five evils are intertwined. From the viewpoint of the rising and descending flow of qi and blood, one can observe that the qi and blood of the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians can all be harmed, resulting in both red and white dysentery. From the perspective of dampness and heat as a disease, it is clear that the causes of dampness and heat are not singular. From the differentiation of dysentery into deficiency and excess, one can see that all symptoms among patients with dysentery, such as restlessness, dry throat, black tongue, belching, heaviness in the back, abdominal pain, bloating, as well as foot pain, swelling, and weakness, have distinctions between deficiency and excess. Therefore, I conclude that dysentery arises from evil entering the stomach to create dampness and heat; when qi is harmed, it causes illness in the lungs; when blood is harmed, it is transmitted to the heart. The heart and lungs are the masters of blood and qi. Once the pathways of blood and qi are affected, how can they not return to the organs they govern? The large and small intestines are related to the heart and lungs, being the officials in charge of the intake and distribution of food and fluids. The stomach is the chief of the large and small intestines, and it is also the sea that contains the qi of the five organs and six bowels as well as the twelve meridians. If there are external and internal evils that harm the organs and meridians, or if the evil moves to the stomach, which belongs to the transformation of damp earth, then when the stomach suffers from the evil, the dampness cannot be transformed, accumulating and resulting in damp heat.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When diseases of the heart and lungs transfer to the intestines, if only the large intestine suffers, the qi becomes concentrated and forms white dysentery; if only the small intestine suffers, the blood becomes concentrated and forms red dysentery; if both the large and small intestines are affected, red and white mix and are expelled together. The damp heat of the stomach that corrupts the large and small intestines also follows this pattern, with a yellow color. If the color is black, there are two types: one is a scorched black, which is black caused by extreme heat combined with water transformation; the other is a glossy black like lacquer, which represents stagnant blood. </p>
<p>Some say: Treating dysentery begins in the intestines and stomach, which is the commonly held practice; now, if we seek the initial pathogens and the channels they entered, what is the use? It is said: The disease in the intestines and stomach is the manifestation. The pathogens encountered and the channels first affected are the root cause. Furthermore, the Inner Canon indicates that for treating root and branch, there are appropriate methods for each, and the order of application matters. Additionally, the methods for transferring and changing conditions are not different from those for treating febrile diseases; how can one not pursue this? </p>
<p>Is it just this? As for diseases arising from the intestines and stomach, they should also be analyzed based on the balance of pathogenic and righteous qi. Either the righteous qi is initially deficient, allowing the invasion of pathogens, or it becomes deficient due to the pathogens; thus, the former is the root cause, and the latter is the manifestation, akin to the distinction between old and new accumulations. Old accumulations are formed from retained food and phlegm, while new accumulations arise after the old are eliminated and result from stagnation of qi and blood. Old accumulations should be treated first through elimination, while new accumulations should not be purged.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is the reason for this? It is because the digestion of water and grains in the intestines and stomach, along with the transportation of waste, all depend on the function of the spleen and stomach. Now, if there is an evil presence in the intestines and stomach, the spleen and stomach cannot operate freely, leading to obstruction, and so the defensive qi becomes stagnant and cannot circulate, while the nourishing blood weeps and cannot move. Consequently, phlegm accumulates in the stomach, waste remains in the intestines, and together with the stagnant qi and weeping blood, this results in a blockage that causes illness. In such cases, one must expel the blockage to ensure the smooth functioning of the spleen and stomach. If the ascending and descending processes still do not function, the defensive qi becomes stagnant again, and the nourishing blood weeps again, creating new accumulation, thus the illness returns. In this situation, it is unnecessary to seek out the evil to treat it; rather, one should regulate the defensive qi to open the pores, harmonize the nourishing blood to adjust the balance of yin and yang. When yin and yang are balanced and the pores are open, the pathways of ascending and descending will function, and the accumulation will dissipate on its own. However, there are certain accumulations that must not be purged. Initially, due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, they cannot transform and transport the food accumulations, so one must first replenish the spleen and stomach, ensuring that the true qi within them is full, and then one can purge it, so as to avoid any errors. I have often encountered popular methods that adhere to a limited number of prescriptions for treating dysentery, mainly relying on purging. But how can one know that the medicines used to attack the illness are all those that drain qi and damage blood? If used continuously, they can even lead to the scattering of qi and loss of blood, leaving the five zang organs empty, and the essence depleted, resulting in the spirit departing and death. Such closing and stagnation will only increase the qi stagnation and weeping blood problems, leading to abdominal distention, lower limb swelling, and coughs, among other ailments. The methods of dealing with illnesses in this world are hardly worth adhering to!<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

<p>Danxi stated: For conditions that can be treated by Zhang Jing’s methods, one should use the Chengqi Decoction. The cold nature of Da Huang is good for moving, while the warm nature of Hou Po is effective for promoting the smooth movement of stagnant qi. The sweetness of Gan Cao softens the mixture. When administered with warm liquid, it cleanses and nourishes the intestines and stomach, making them light and agile, thus stopping the accumulation. One should avoid the use of toxic substances such as arsenic, vermillion, Ba, and Nao, as their aggressive poison may harm the pure qi of the intestines and stomach. Furthermore, it is said that “in the prescriptions, hot medicines are primarily used, while cold medicines are supplementary.&quot; This may be acceptable for treating clear dysentery, but when there are urgent symptoms with heaviness after defecation, these conditions are all related to heat. Adding cold and hot medicines would only exacerbate the condition. The preceding discussion focuses on the treatment of cold, arguing that dysentery arises in autumn due to the accumulation of summer heat, which is quite reasonable, and the arguments are also balanced.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is not clear what specifically causes the oppressive heat; it often arises from intense summer heat, excessive consumption of ice water, or overindulgence in cold foods, leading to heat being trapped by cold. If these conditions persist, they may result in a lingering accumulation of cold. One must not rigidly classify it as heat without discerning the conditions through pulse diagnosis; only then can one confirm the presence of heat accumulation and consider the use of Da Huang (rhubarb). If it is a cold accumulation, using Da Huang will not only fail to alleviate the condition but may also exacerbate the pain and create a crisis.</p>
<p>Generally, for heat dysentery, Da Huang is used; for cold dysentery, Ba Dou (cascara) is employed. It is imperative to use the correct medicine for the specific illness. The methods established by ancient practitioners must be adhered to without deviation. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; outlines two essential approaches: one involves steaming Da Huang with wine, and the other involves wax pills of Ba Dou, with clear distinctions that must not be overlooked. It is also said that warming herbs may be acceptable for clear, watery dysentery, but must not be used for pure blood dysentery. Furthermore, Wang Haizang noted that during the hot months, one should avoid Huang Lian (coptis) as there is an underlying deficiency.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

The doctor treated him with cooling medicines, specifically using Huang Lian, Mu Xiang, and Ejiao. If this illness is addressed early, it can be treated, but if it has persisted for a long time, leading to an empty intestine, it is not appropriate to take such medicines. After more than ten days, he nearly reached a critical state and required a different treatment. This discussion can also be found in the preface of &quot;Lui Zheng Ben Cao.&quot; Haicang says: Master Yang, after three bouts of heavy drunkenness, woke up feeling extremely thirsty and drank three large cups of cold water. The next day, he drank three bowls of tea, but subsequently experienced fresh blood in his stool four times, enough to fill a basin. Initially, he was given Wu Zhu Yu pills, and the following day, he took equal parts of Ping Wei and Wu Ling powders. After three large doses, the blood stopped, but then he had white dysentery again. He took Gan Ying pills four times, and the white dysentery stopped, allowing him to return to his usual state. Someone asked: Why was Huang Lian and similar medicines not used to clear the toxins, but rather warm and hot agents? I replied: If cold and cooling medicines are used, the illness can greatly change, making it difficult to heal from internal cold and toxins. Additionally, using cold and cooling treatment is not the proper way to address this issue.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, when blood is congealed by cold and seeps into the intestines leading to diarrhea, it requires warmth to flow naturally, which is why warm medicines are used; then the blood will stop. The classics state that to treat illness, one must seek the root cause, and this is what is meant. When the stomach is warmed, the blood will not congeal and will flow freely, each component maintaining its proper state. This example illustrates that one should not rigidly adhere to the idea of using cold. If one encounters dysentery with blood, it cannot simply be seen as a heat issue.</p>
<p>In general, if there is abdominal pain accompanied by a feeling of heaviness, reduced urination, thirst with a preference for cold drinks, and dryness in the intestines, this is categorized as a heat-related dysentery, and the previously mentioned methods are indeed appropriate. However, if there is abdominal pain without thirst, a preference for warm drinks, clear and frequent urination, no fever in the body, and a preference for warm compresses on the abdomen, this indicates a cold-related dysentery and should be treated with warming herbs like ginger and cinnamon.</p>

<p>There is also a type of yin deficiency resembling dysentery, specifically referring to frequent loose stools and abdominal distension.

According to the Zhu family, if yin has been exhausted and further depleted, there will be pulling pain in bowel movements. The more pain, the more the urge to go; the more one goes, the more pain increases. The symptoms are a mix of red and white, urgency in the lower abdomen with heavy sensation, resembling dysentery, with painful and scanty urination, or painful obstruction, or the urge to urinate while passing stool first, or wanting to defecate but experiencing incontinence.

After dysentery, excessive discharge may lead to blood loss, with energy dispersing alongside the dysentery. This results in both yin and yang being deficient; yang deficiency leads to aversion to cold, whereas yin deficiency leads to aversion to heat, causing a conflict between cold and heat, resembling malaria but not truly malaria. Hence, a theory of deficiency is formulated and treated with strengthening and warming tonics for self-recovery.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery is a condition that is difficult to describe. In the &quot;Ling&quot; and &quot;Su,&quot; it is referred to as &quot;intestine collapse&quot; and also as &quot;obstructed discharge.&quot; The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; categorizes vomiting, sudden diarrhea, and dysentery as a single condition, as all three stem from illnesses of the Yangming stomach and the hand Yangming large intestine. However, when discussing diarrhea, it aligns with the main symptoms of the Jueyin channel in &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; and this does not match with the vomiting and sudden diarrhea of the two Yangming categories. </p>
<p>In their discourse, both Jue and diarrhea are frequently mentioned together. It is first stated that if the qi of the six fu organs is exhausted externally, the hands and feet are cold; if the qi of the five zang organs is exhausted internally, diarrhea cannot be controlled. Thus, the dual presence of Jue and diarrhea signifies extreme deficiency and coldness. For those who can still eat, they die, but those who develop a fever often do not. Why is there such a contradiction? </p>
<p>This likely stems from the omission of dysentery from the section on vomiting and sudden diarrhea in the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; and subsequently, the incorporation of the lower diarrhea narrative from the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage.&quot; Many later practitioners have repeatedly tried and failed to verify this, leading to frequent errors in practice.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In winter, during the month when cold leads to diarrhea, and in summer and autumn, when heat causes diarrhea, one might invoke Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s treatments and speak in vain about techniques? Later generations, lacking guidance, present their own biased views based on what they observe with their eyes and test with their hands, spreading widely these notions, which cannot be considered as proper methods, hence declaring that there are no correct formulas for dysentery and malaria. How did medical practice come to such a state? I respectfully reference the methods of Zhang Zhongjing of Huangqi and propose this discussion. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that in winter, cold leads to illness and fever, while in summer and autumn, the three heat energies of summer heat and humidity intermingle and produce heat that is much stronger than in winter. When externally induced heat from the three energies leads to diarrhea, it must be expelled from the outside. Therefore, diarrhea must first be resolved by sweating to treat the exterior and then regulate the interior. Firstly, use warming herbs to resolve the exterior, and secondly, use bitter cold herbs to clear the interior; one or two doses may cure. If there is neglect in treating the exterior, the external pathogens will escape through the interior, leading to a situation where one does not recover and cannot stop suffering. Thus, even after a hundred days, one should still apply methods akin to rowing against the current to draw out the pathogens to the exterior, as those on the brink of death may still be saved and those in critical condition can be stabilized.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When treating chronic diarrhea, the effects are clear and can be documented. It is detailed in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; that if one has a reeling pulse with diarrhea and experiences fever and sweating, they will recover on their own. In cases of prolonged diarrhea, the pulse is deeply rooted in the yin portion, and it becomes soft and weak. Suddenly, if the pulse changes to a reeling quality, this indicates the emergence of yang energy; without using reversal techniques, how could this occur? Prolonged diarrhea allows the evil to invade the yin, and the body will not be hot; if there is any deficiency heat, it will lead to a persistent fever. Now, due to the method of reversal, we force a temporary surge of disturbances, and soon the evil is expelled from the surface, causing the heat to dissipate. Prolonged diarrhea leads to a sinking of yang energy, resulting in dry skin and an absence of sweat. Now, using the reversal techniques to support the exterior yang, we drive the evil back to the surface, causing sweating, which results in a calm abdomen and ultimately the resolution of the illness.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How could one dare to rely on untrained intellect? Moreover, there is the sudden onslaught of summer heat and dampness, causing water and food to exit the body. In a day and night, one may sweat profusely and drink excessively, with thirst unquenchable. This signifies that the intestines and stomach are under attack from hot toxins, quickly rotting away. This condition is tenfold more severe than ingesting purgative poison or lead. The method of forcefully countering this is both misguided and far-fetched! </p>
<p>One should adhere to the principles outlined in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; using such remedies as rhubarb, coptis, and licorice, taking them three to five doses over a day and night, waiting for the downward force of diarrhea and the thirst to ease before beginning to balance internally. There is no need to resort to external measures since the hostility, like water breaking against stone, will naturally exit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the emergency method of rapidly opening the &quot;river&quot; of the body. The heat and toxins inside rush towards the large intestine and may become obstructed in the bladder. If the bladder is hot and stagnant, the transformation of qi is impaired, leading to short, painful urination. Hence, it is more appropriate to facilitate this flow rather than forcibly countering the condition. Clearing the bladder allows for qi to flow and dissipate the heat swiftly.</p>
<p>Zhongjing stated: &quot;When there is a downward flow of qi, one should promote urination.&quot; Qi is the essence transformed by the bladder; if it is instead being expelled from the large intestine, then facilitating urination is indeed necessary. However, when water flows from a high source and the lungs are not hot, urination will occur naturally. The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; the heat of the large intestine arises from the heat of the lungs. Thus, it is particularly important to use cool, pungent medicines to first clear the transformation source in the lungs.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; for diarrhea and lung pain, the main prescription is Zishen Decoction, while Qilei Le Powder is also indicated. Later generations doubted that these two formulas were from Zhongjing, not realizing that intestinal and stomach issues are fundamentally connected to the lungs. The &quot;Bencao&quot; states: Zishen is for the accumulation in the chest and abdomen, treating internal heat in the intestines and stomach, unblocking the nine orifices, and facilitating urination and defecation. Zhongjing selected it for its principle of unblocking through the means of unblocking use. Qilei Le has both unblocking and obstructing effects; it clears phlegm, digests stagnant food, resolves qi stagnation, while also firming up the intestines to prevent collapse. Zhongjing chose it for its mutual application of unblocking and obstructing as well. Thus, if there is pain due to obstructed lung qi, one should urgently clear that obstruction; if the large intestine&#39;s qi is descending and causing pressure, then mutual application of unblocking and obstructing will help regulate its appropriateness. Alas! The methods of the &quot;Neijing&quot; may not be directly actionable; one seeks from the &quot;Jinkui&quot;; when the methods for diarrhea in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; seem unapproachable, turn to the spirit of one&#39;s own heart in wakefulness and dream, and one will understand the &quot;Jinkui&quot; methods as if they are at one’s fingertips.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Unfortunately, youthful time has been wasted, and now I am old, unable to make further progress. I write these humble thoughts as a contribution for later generations to delve deeper into this subject.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of malaria, one should progress from the lesser yang and retreat in between. Advancing towards the yang should indeed start with the lesser yang as a guiding principle. Likewise, for dysentery, one should also refer to the lesser yang, since the qi from food and drink enters the stomach and moves rapidly downward; initially, the energy of the lesser yang is not able to expand, and subsequently, it becomes trapped. Thus, rather than broadly seeking the three yang, it is better to specifically seek the lesser yang, allowing the clear energy from the heavens to elevate and the flavors of the water and earth to transform naturally, with subtle and proper dispersal, avoiding the suffering of urgent dysentery.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the bodily fluids stored in the two yangming channels have already been excreted, one should not further induce sweating. The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; clearly states the prohibition on sweating when in the presence of yangming excess, and the &quot;Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet&quot; reinforces the ban on inducing sweating in cases of diarrhea, stating that one should not attack the exterior when there is clear diarrhea from food intake, as sweating will inevitably lead to fullness and distension.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Excessive loss of bodily fluids harms the essence; sweating further depletes these fluids. When bodily fluids are diminished, the stomach energy is void, leading to the escape of turbid air downwards. This, compounded by the upward flow of sweat, results in bloating and fullness. When one seeks resolution for the diarrhea but cannot find it, is this not a serious warning? Therefore, one should adhere to the method of the lesser yang, gently reversing the descending clear energy, allowing the body to follow the natural orders of spring and summer without causing repression. In essence, this is a harmonizing method, entirely distinct from the intention of inducing sweat. If the bodily fluids are not harmed, sweating does not pose a problem; but if the fluids are harmed, any slight moisture between the skin is already indicative of rising problematic energy. Can the exterior invasion of wind and cold in the greater yang simply be treated with sweating? Can the combined conditions of the greater yang and yangming presenting with diarrhea be treated like that with kudzu root? Alas! How subtle this is! </p>
<p>For treating dysentery, use the method that is open and prevalent, alongside the gold needle technique. The pathogenic fire, dampness, and heat press forth and should only be remedied with bitter and cold herbs, such as those found in the major and minor purge formulas.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat dysentery with a tight mouth, many use Huang Lian, which is indeed a medicine for damp-heat, but it is bitter and descending, unable to open and uplift; moreover, it is not suitable for cases of stomach deficiency, hence I dare not use it. Some use the mud of pond snails, applied to the navel, to guide the heat downwards, which is most effective. However, when there is stagnant heat, one should alternate between ascending and descending methods, and cannot rely solely on one approach. Using spices like clove and sand cardamom with fire to aid fire can lead to harm.</p>
<p>In cases where diarrhea occurs prior to dysentery, it is an indication of reversal. If the condition persists despite attempts to reopen, it indicates deficiency. A weak and slow pulse calls for warming and tonifying treatment. A taut and rapid pulse indicates reversal and is a sign of imminent death. Postpartum dysentery also requires warming and tonification.</p>
<p>For cases with blood in the stool, cooling and activating the blood is necessary, using herbs like Angelica, Huangqin, and peach kernel. If there is evil wind descending, a lifting approach is needed. If damp-heat injures the blood, one should clarify dampness and clear heat.</p>
<p>For long-term dysentery with blood that does not heal, it indicates yang deficiency and yin evacuation, warranting the use of Ba Zhen Decoction with herbs that uplift. If there are paroxysms from below, with cold limbs, and the pulse gradually weakens, this signals a risk of vital energy collapse; urgent moxibustion at the Qihai point and using Fuzi Lichong Decoction is crucial—delay can lead to death.</p>
<p>For chronic dysentery with a weak and sinking pulse, where various medicines are ineffective, one can use Shiquan Dabu Decoction with ginger and jujube, adding a small amount of honey to be consumed as a decoction.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

<p>From the perspective of the intestines and stomach, the large intestine represents the symptoms and the stomach represents the root cause. From the perspective of the meridians, the Yangming channels of the hands and feet represent the symptoms, while the Shaoyang fire represents the root cause. Thus, when the stomach is affected by damp-heat, the food and water are transformed by the fire of the Shaoyang into foul and turbid substances, which then enter the large intestine. If one only treats the Yangming channel without addressing the Shaoyang, it will be of no benefit.

<p><strong>Discussion on Proof</strong></p>
<p>Dysentery is more prevalent at the turn of summer and autumn. Traditional methods passed down through the ages all assert that the fierce summer heat leads to the commanding of the fire element, which, combined with the intense heat&#39;s toxin, accumulates to cause dysentery. </p>
<p>Contemporary beliefs largely align with this notion that dysentery arises from summer heat, making it understandable that it involves heat. However, heat is a natural phenomenon of heaven. If there is a day when it is not hot, it inevitably leads to disaster. It is common for individuals to desire coolness due to the heat. Overindulging in raw and cold foods is what brings about dysentery.</p>
<p>Many who are cautious of illness, despite exposure to intense heat, do not suffer from cold and coolness, hence they experience no dysentery. Is it not that they uniquely do not succumb to heat? The illness actually stems from the cold evil rather than the summer heat; it lies in human actions, rather than the weather. This can be deduced clearly.</p>
<p>However, those with strong stomachs and solid vitality can consume fruits and similar items daily and remain healthy, thus avoiding illness. </p>
<p>Those slightly weaker may not be ill immediately, but over time, when the intense heat shifts westward and the newly cool air arrives, the lurking internal yin becomes active, seizing the opportunity to strike. Thus, cold dampness tends to invade the spleen particularly in the months of July and August, marking the transition from yang declining to yin rising, which is easy to observe.</p>
<p>Lastly, those with inherently weak spleens and stomachs will easily fall ill as conditions arise without needing to be exposed to cold, nor waiting for the season; this is particularly common.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Eating cold foods causes diarrhea; how can this possibly turn into heat? How is it that modern medicine sees only the heat of the season and not the coldness in a person&#39;s organs? They only recognize the symptoms of dysentery, hastily declaring it as hot poison, and instead treat the cold with cooling methods. Is this not like adding frost on snow? Common understanding leads to many deaths. Some may claim that there are instances where cold medicines lead to recovery; why is this? It is due to individuals with strong stomachs and an abundance of yang who develop heat from dampness. There are also those whose vital energy is robust and where the evil does not overpower the righteous. Cases like these can use cold treatments and recover, or they may benefit from purging methods, but these individuals are extremely rare. Many, however, have weak stomachs and yang deficiency, suffering injury from cold. For these individuals, further use of cooling treatments or rash purging will invariably lead to death. All those who die from dysentery belong to this category. Observing Danxi, it is said that those with dysentery are more often of the heat type than of the cold type. Dai Yuanli states that the intense heat poison, as autumn arrives, when the yang energy begins to decline and fire energy decreases, leads to stagnation-related symptoms. These are all grievous misunderstandings and should not be trusted. A popular saying cautions us: &quot;In hot summer, yin evils easily invade. Heat is the main affliction, while wind and cold are the guests. If the body is not exposed to wind, how can malaria develop? If the mouth does not receive cold, how can dysentery occur?&quot; Treatment must seek the root cause, beyond mere fleeting symptoms. This subtle wisdom can be a guiding principle for physicians.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Yin and Yang</h3>
<p>In treating dysentery, it is crucial to observe the nature of Yin and Yang, and distinguish between cold and heat; this is the most significant relationship in dysentery. If these four aspects are unclear, it becomes very easy to cause harm.</p>
<p>In distinguishing between excess conditions, one must note a robust physical appearance, strong and smooth pulse, or a history of indulgence in food and drink, or notable abdominal distension, hardness, and pain, especially in younger patients with recent onset and without damage to the spleen&#39;s energy; only then can one employ symptomatic treatments. For mild cases, promote movement; for more severe cases, use purgatives.</p>
<p>In distinguishing deficiency conditions, look for weakened body structure, pale or bluish complexion, pulse that is rapid yet weak and lacking vitality, pulse that appears firm yet is actually weak, patients with inherent Yang deficiency, those prone to coldness or subtle indigestion, encountering cold or damp weather, or cases of improper diet, particularly in individuals with weaker spleens due to age. In all these instances, if there has been no prior indulgence and dysentery suddenly occurs, it is likely due to consuming something cold or a slight injury to stomach energy; there would be no accumulation or heat present. Hence, those with weak spleens often exhibit such symptoms.</p>
<p>For treatment, one should only warm and regulate the spleen and stomach; warming the spleen will dispel cold, thus expelling the pathogen. Furthermore, the pathogens themselves are not numerous; employing warming tonics to strengthen the spleen poses no risk. A few doses will lead to complete recovery. It is essential not to hastily claim that tonics will trap the pathogens and thus proceed with harsh purgatives or fire-clearing medicines first. If the spleen&#39;s energy is further damaged, lighter cases will worsen and severe cases will become critical.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

<p>In distinguishing the symptoms of dysentery as cold or heat, if it is indeed heat, one will surely fear heat and prefer coolness, not wanting clothing or blankets, experiencing extreme thirst and drinking a lot of water, with possibly hot and painful urination or diarrhea that is purely bright red blood. The pulse will certainly be slippery, firm, and strong, and one’s physical condition will be restless and irritable. If the heat symptoms are genuine, then cooling treatments should be employed, possibly combined with methods to expel the pathogenic influences; the illness will heal on its own. However, if these heat symptoms are not present and the dysentery persists, it must be due to deficiency and cold. If one does not warm and tonify the spleen and kidneys, healing cannot be achieved; even if there is some recovery, it must be that the underlying energy is well-rooted, waiting for its return. One should not believe that there are deficiency and cold symptoms that can heal without warming and tonifying. Sometimes treatments for dysentery must be cool, and while cooling methods can be harmless, if not applied properly, they can lead to complications.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Accumulation of Filth</h3>
<p>The issue of accumulation in the abdomen involves the stagnation of food and drink that gathers within, sometimes forming lumps, or causing distension and pain, not digesting or moving due to obstruction—this is what is termed accumulation, which should be expelled. However, people today are unable to discern this properly; they see diarrhea with purulent filth and wrongly label it as accumulation, not realizing that this does not fall under the category of stagnant matter but is actually fat that adheres to the intestines and viscera, all belonging to the essence of blood. Regardless of whether one is thin or fat, all have this fat; the fat is thicker in the fat person and thinner in the thin person, and there is no one without fat. If there were truly no fat, how would the space between the intestines permit anything to be thin and exposed? Not only would this lack of support be insecure, but the organs would also be easily harmed—this is illogical. In the case of those suffering from diarrhea, it is merely the fat of the five internal organs that is not secure, causing it to be stripped away daily. If the strength of the organ&#39;s energy is slightly robust, it can go and come as it pleases, and there is little to worry about. If the organ&#39;s energy deteriorates, being stripped away completely, or if one suffers from prolonged diarrhea, only observing blood and watery discharge, the average person may claim that there is no longer lingering accumulation and even deem it good, not knowing that if the fat is scraped away completely, it signifies an extreme dangerous condition. If one recognizes this as fat rather than accumulation, then there is no time to be at ease or secure, yet one still dares to say to attack and expel it, or to use bitter cold to lubricate and benefit?<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

<p>The distinctions among the five colors are akin to the substances of diarrhea and pus, all of which are transformed by the blood and energy. The white color arises more superficially, resembling the floating fats; the red color comes from deeper sources, associated with fats that penetrate the skin and vessels. When there is pure blood, it often signifies heat pressing upon it, thus it spills over and flows down, which is the deepest condition. The purple-red and purple-white colors indicate a prolonged separation, where the discharge doesn’t occur quickly, and the colors change due to that delay, or they haven&#39;t yet reached the vessels, marking a slightly shallower condition. When red and white are combined, this indicates variations in depth. Generally, pure bright red signifies more heat pathology, as its fiery nature is urgent and forceful in its descent. Purple-red and purple-white indicate less heat pathology, due to the stagnation and damage caused by cold Yin. Pure white signifies no heat pathology, as it arises from the organs&#39; cold, thin, and slippery conditions. However, there are cases of being without red while still indicating heat; this falls into the category of violent onset, not merely classified as diarrhea.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

This is due to damage to the yin network, rather than a violent outpouring. When distinguishing between the yellow and black colors, any deep yellow that is foul and smelly indicates a presence of heat, as well as cold. If the yellow is light and less odorous, possibly accompanied by a fishy odor (suggesting consumption on the left and retention on the right), this indicates a type that does not transform, which is all cold. A thick, black color that is very foul-smelling indicates a scorched condition, often associated with heat. However, a bluish-black that is thin and fishy represents decay in the liver and kidneys, yet it is still mistakenly considered as heat. Although the differentiation of the five colors generally follows this pattern, in cases of dysentery with blood, it is solely due to injury to the yin network. Whether it is cold or hot, if the network vessels are damaged, bleeding will occur. Therefore, one cannot simply assume that blood presence indicates heat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Abdominal Pain</h3>
<p>In cases of diarrhea and abdominal pain, there are those with excess heat and those with deficiency cold. For excess heat, it may arise from food accumulation or the invasion of pathogenic heat. However, the pain from food accumulation is usually accompanied by distension, fullness, and hardness, or it is painful to the touch, indicating that there is something stagnating. For minor cases, it is advisable to eliminate the stagnation, while for severe cases, purging and expelling it is suitable. </p>
<p>In cases of pain from pathogenic heat, there will often be signs of internal heat, hence it is appropriate to clear and benefit the body. However, when there is a substantial pathogenic presence inside, there will often be a lot of rebellious qi. Therefore, the method of treating pain, whether it’s due to heat or food, should always prioritize the movement of qi, while considering the nature of the remedies in terms of heat and cold, and selecting them accordingly.</p>
<p>Abdominal pain from deficiency cold is particularly important to distinguish. Generally, pain from diarrhea is mostly due to cold qi in the organs. The classics say: pain is often due to an excess of cold qi. Thus, pain occurs because of cold. It also states: illness causing pain is associated with yin. Therefore, if a person overeats raw or cold foods, or is exposed to cold air, they may experience abdominal pain; this is well understood. </p>
<p>If cold is present internally, the treatment should warm the spleen; if cold is in the lower regions, the treatment should warm the kidneys. Furthermore, the principle of deficiency cold causing pain is often not well known. If the original qi is insufficient internally, even without external cold pathogens, if the internal qi is not warmed, this is a cold syndrome. As a result, diarrhea cannot be stopped, food cannot be digested, and the illness cannot be cured, precisely because there is a deficiency of yang leading to excess cold.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The persistent diarrhea causes damage to the stomach qi, and with the essence and blood harming the skin, how can there be no pain? This pain results from the inflammation reaching the intestines. Therefore, diarrhea is caused by pain, and pain arises from diarrhea. Thus, any invasion of cold into the internal organs or injury to the meridians and vessels leading to blood movement and qi stagnation can produce pain. However, it is important to note if the condition is weak and not solid, if there is a tendency to enjoy gentle pressure or warmth, if the chest and abdomen feel empty and there is a lack of desire to eat, or if there is nausea with excess salivation, but without indicators of solid heat, then it is generally classified as deficiency and cold. How can pain be said to always stem from accumulation and to always indicate solid proof in such cases? </p>
<p>In treating pain caused by deficiency and cold, it is essential to promptly warm and nourish the internal qi, without further depleting it, which would lead to a nurturing pain becoming worse, and smooth maladies becoming more pronounced, posing a significant risk. Some claim that pain does not warrant tonics until it has stabilized, but this can deplete vital essence day by day, with no end in sight. I&#39;ve seen a physician state that dysentery must last seven days before tonics can be used, ignorant that the patient may die within six days. This stubbornness is exceedingly foolish.</p>
<p>However, for those with intense pain, it is advisable to slightly add an aromatic herb, such as patchouli, to the nourishing concoction to harmonize the qi, or to increase angelica to regulate blood; once the pain alleviates, these two ingredients should be removed. This caution stems from the fear of patchouli depleting qi and angelica causing excessive intestinal relaxation. If the cold is in the lower burner inducing pain, then the addition of evodia is necessary. If the pain is not severe, then the primary approach should center on warming and tonifying the spleen and kidneys; as the condition stabilizes, the pain should naturally subside without needing specific treatment for the pain.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is urgency and heaviness in the lower abdomen, the illness resides at the lowest part of the large intestine, but its root cause is not in the large intestine; it lies in the spleen and kidneys. Various forms of dysentery, whether hot, cold, or arising from deficiency, are present and cannot all be classified as heat. If there is heat in the middle burner, it compels heat pathogens downwards; if there is cold in the middle burner, it compels cold pathogens downwards; if there is deficiency of spleen and kidney qi, it causes qi to descend and press downwards. To treat this, one must first understand the cause and then address the root of the spleen and kidneys, and there will be no case that does not heal.</p>
<p>However, if the illness is in the large intestine, it is no longer simply a case of food accumulation. When food accumulation reaches this point, it would not leave any residue upon diarrhea; what remains is merely the descending qi, which is formless. Thus, even if there seems to be an urge to expel, in reality, there is nothing to expel. When there is nothing to expel yet it appears there is an urge, it is purely the effect of qi. Hence, the use of Shao Yao Decoction by Hejian, which claims that moving the blood leads to self-healing and adjusting the qi alleviates heaviness at the back, is indeed logical. However, adjusting the qi must be done appropriately: for heat in the qi, cool it; for cold in the qi, warm it; for deficiency in the qi, tonify it; for descending qi, uplift it; it is essential to harmonize the qi, only then can it be regulated. The method of moving blood is similar. If one merely uses ingredients like Mu Xiang, Bing Lang, Dang Gui, and Da Huang to dispel qi and move blood, as a means of harmonization without realizing that the large intestine is the farthest point, thus making it difficult for the medicine to reach it, what actually disperses and moves is merely the qi of the middle burner. Moreover, if the qi has already descended, further dispersing and moving it will only cause it to descend further; will there be any possibility of healing? Moreover, dysentery must stop before heaviness can stop, and there has never been a case where dysentery does not heal and yet heaviness can heal. Therefore, anyone wishing to treat this should focus on treating the dysentery as the main priority.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Pain from the Large Intestine</strong></p>
<p>In cases of dysentery, there are often pains from the large intestine. What is the reason for this? It is because the spleen and stomach are out of harmony; thus, the vital essence of food and drink fails to transform properly, leading to oppressive and foul substances being expelled through the orifices, resulting in unavoidable pain. Furthermore, if fire causes diarrhea and yang is driven away by yin, then the yang energy in the stomach becomes forced downward, unable to disperse, which gives rise to swelling. Therefore, where dysentery is more severe, pain is also greater; where dysentery is less severe, pain is also less. Pain and absence of pain are determined by whether the energy is trapped or not. Consequently, regardless of whether it is cold dysentery or hot dysentery, pain can arise from the large intestine and cannot be solely attributed to heat. To treat this, one need only address the dysentery; when the dysentery ceases, the swelling and pain will naturally resolve, akin to the principle of heaviness after defecation. As Danxi stated: pain from the large intestine arises when heat flows downward, and the main remedies are musk, areca nut, scutellaria, and coptis combined with fried ginger. This shows that it is known that fire can cause swelling and pain, but how does one comprehend the sinking of original yang? Subsequent generations have all followed this method. As for those with deficiency and cold, many cannot endure this condition.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　凡泻痢证必多口渴，今人但见口渴，即认为火，不知有火者固能渴，无火者亦能渴，不可不辨也。如火盛于中，则熏脾烁胃，津液耗干，故酷好冰水，多而不厌，愈凉愈快，随饮随消者，此因热而渴，治宜凉也。如口热作渴，虽欲饮水而饮不能多者，即非真火，不宜凉也。凡口虽干渴喜凉，而腹不喜凉者，是寒聚于中，而无根之火浮戴于上，此最忌寒凉者也。然渴有真渴，有似渴。真渴者必好茶饮，但以喜热喜凉，即可辨其寒热。<a id="orig-114p" href="#trans-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Thirst</h3>
<p>All cases of dysentery must involve significant thirst. Nowadays, people only see thirst and immediately attribute it to heat, not realizing that both those with heat and those without can experience thirst. It is crucial to distinguish between the two. When heat is strong within, it scorches the spleen and burns the stomach, depleting fluids and causing a strong craving for cold water, which they consume excessively to the point of never growing tired of it; the cooler it is, the more they desire it. This indicates thirst due to heat, which requires treatment with cooling methods. </p>
<p>However, if the mouth is hot and thirsty, but one cannot drink much water despite wanting to, this is not true heat and should not be treated with cooling methods. Generally, if the mouth is dry and thirsty preferring coolness, but the stomach does not tolerate coolness, this indicates cold accumulating within, while superficial heat lingers above. Such cases strongly contraindicate cold remedies. </p>
<p>Thirst can be genuine or deceptive. A true thirst must prefer tea; just by observing the preference for hot or cold, one can discern the nature of the heat or cold.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Like someone who is thirsty, they may feel dry, but it does not mean they are truly thirsty. If the mouth is dry yet there is no desire to drink, it indicates that it is certainly not a heat syndrome. However, in cases of diarrhea, because the fluids leak downwards, there will inevitably be a depletion of fluids upwards, hence the feeling of thirst cannot be avoided. Thirst accompanied by a desire to drink is due to insufficient internal fluids, seeking external fluids for assistance; it does not necessarily indicate the presence of heat. Therefore, one must carefully assess whether there is heat or not. If there is an excess of heat, one should clear the heat; if there is a deficiency of water, one should nourish the yin. Moreover, qi is the mother of water; if there is qi deficiency that cannot generate water, without nourishing the mother, water cannot be produced and thirst remains unrelieved. The spleen governs water; if there is spleen deficiency that cannot control water, without strengthening the main organ, water cannot be stored and thirst persists. If one can treat the cause of thirst rather than just addressing the thirst itself, what need is there for a thirst condition?<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Small Urine</strong></p>
<p>In all cases of dysentery, small urine will often be abundant and not beneficial; there may be much yellow or red. This is significantly related to the conditions of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess, and must not be overlooked. If there is sudden diarrhea, due to the unclear distinction between clean and turbid, food and fluids both enter the large intestine, hence the water may not be beneficial; this is only temporary. However, in dysentery accompanied by small urine, the underlying illness is not uniform. Nowadays, people merely see yellow or red and conclude it is heat, which leads to many misunderstandings. In cases due to heat, the heat must be very intense and may involve considerable pain or fresh blood; only then should there be signs of heat both above and below. This indicates true heat, which should be treated with cooling methods. If it is not true heat, it may arise from internal cold constraining the yang in the lower region, or from the loss of yin due to diarrhea causing water to be depleted and the color to change, or from the lower yang&#39;s failure to warm and transform water, or from improper use of astringent methods that deplete fluids. However, if there is no fire in the three warmers, then despite the yellow or turbid appearance, it suggests a lack of yin and fluids, and can&#39;t simply be analyzed as heat. It is imperative to nourish and support true yin as it is the best approach. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;When the middle qi is insufficient, urine and stools will change.&quot; How profound are these words! Why do people nowadays fail to recognize this? Additionally, whenever small urine is clear and accompanied by abdominal pain, they still apply herbs like Qin and Lian, but do not understand what this implies.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Doubts and Similarities of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The principle of Yin and Yang is the foundation of nurturing life and treating diseases, yet it is not easily understood by people due to its unpredictable nature. The function of Yin and Yang seeks mutual support, not mutual harm. Mutual support means harmony; there cannot be Yin without Yang, nor Yang withoutYin. Mutual harm causes damage. When Yang harms Yin, it results in withering; when Yin harms Yang, it brings about extinction. All diseases are due to the mutual harm of Yin and Yang, resulting in a loss of harmony. </p>
<p>The nature of Yin and Yang is such that Yin prefers stillness and hates motion, while Yang enjoys warmth and fears cold. When they harm each other, Yin fears the excess of Yang, leading to either withering or desiccation; Yang fears the toxins of Yin, leading to either fleeing or flying away in the presence of Yin&#39;s invasion, which embodies the jealousy of Yin and Yang. </p>
<p>In cases of severe illness that exhibit doubt between false and true, this reflects the evidence. This is particularly evident in cases of typhus and dysentery. Nowadays, those suffering from dysentery often exhibit signs of heat in both the upper and lower parts of the body, which does not always indicate true heat. How can this be observed? For instance, agitation can seem like heat but is not true heat; restlessness can appear mad yet is not madness, leading to a state too vague to describe. This does not represent true Yang evidence. </p>
<p>This agitation is the result of damaged essence and blood, with the fire not having water to cool it, leading to the depletion of Yin&#39;s stillness. Additionally, symptoms where one feels hot above or has pain below, such as thirst and sore throats or redness and heat in the body, may not correspond to true heat.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Water and fire mutually constrain each other; the yang drives away the yin. When fire departs from its proper position, it causes erratic movements. Nowadays, people only observe these symptoms and say that one must look to the physical manifestations of the illness. If the heat from physical symptoms is evident, they still claim it is cold. This reflects an awareness of external heat without recognizing the internal cold, similar to being aware of heat above and not knowing the cold in the middle. Furthermore, how can they understand that restlessness indicates yin deficiency and erratic movements signify yang deficiency? Even within uncertainty, one must still discern clearly. For instance, when the exterior muscles exhibit heat symptoms, one ought to feel aversion to heat, yet they refuse to part from their clothing or coverings. Some may even prefer warmth on their abdomen, indicating the need for warmth or pressure; despite feeling hot externally, there may still be cold internally.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In addition, when there is heat evidence in all nine orifices, there is a strong desire for cold drinks. However, while there may be a craving for cold in the mouth, the stomach fears it.

Even if the mouth and tongue have sores and pain, there is still a desire for hot soup and drinks. This indicates that although there is heat above and below, there is cold in the middle burner. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases of weak yang energy and a faint pulse, as previously discussed. If one only recognizes this as fire and treats it with cold, while the underlying issue is internal cold, adding more cold will only invade the stomach and directly affect the middle burner. The external heat does not relate to this, and the internal cold will become even more severe. Consequently, those who are already ill will become more ill, akin to adding frost on snow. The desire to preserve the solitary yang cannot be achieved. Therefore, in treating such conditions, one should only be able to draw the fire back to its source, warming the elixir field; thus, the fire will then dry out. By solidifying the lower source, energy returns to essence. This is the mysterious principle of the reversal of yin and yang.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Treating</h3>
<p>In general, the principles for treating dysentery involve understanding the conditions of deficiency and excess, cold and heat; grasping these essentials leads to success, while losing sight of them results in the greatest harm. The methods for regulating diarrhea should be carefully applied.</p>
<p>When initially hurt by cold and when dietary irregularities occur, if the stomach qi remains intact and the original qi is not depleted, symptoms such as intense pain, bloating, violent diarrhea, or dysentery might arise, especially if there is food stagnation that hasn&#39;t cleared. In such cases, a dose of Five Virtues Pills, or formulas like Ping Wei San, Wei Ling Tang, and Wu Ling San should be used to mildly dispel cold stagnation; recovery is very attainable.</p>
<p>For those with weak spleen and kidneys who suffer from cold, dysentery can easily occur, regardless of whether they are adults or children. For cases of spleen deficiency leading to dysentery, without the presence of excess heat or other symptoms, it is advisable to first warm the spleen using Guan Jian. If the illness has progressed to involve the liver and kidneys, then Wei Guan Jian is most effective; do not fear using it due to its newness. Alternatively, other formulations like Five Virtues Pills and Four Spirits Pills can also be utilized.</p>
<p>In severe cases of both spleen and kidney deficiency, use Wei Guan Jian as the first choice, followed by Wen Wei Yin, or use both alternately as needed. One may also combine it with formulas like Si Wei San, Jiu Qi Dan, or Fu Yang Dan.</p>
<p>For dysentery accompanied by vomiting and a strong urge to vomit, or if there is a feeling of nausea upon smelling food, this indicates that cold has weakened the stomach qi, making it unable to tolerate. It is essential to warm and nourish the stomach. Use prescriptions like Wu Jun Zi Jian, Liu Wei Yi Gong Jian, Wen Wei Yin, and Sheng Zhu San for this condition. If vomiting is severe, then Liu Wei Hui Yang Yin should be the primary treatment. If there is a deficiency of fire in the yin, causing nausea due to qi not returning to the original source, then Wei Guan Jian and Li Yin Jian should be used as the main treatments.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If gastrointestinal fire rises and causes vomiting, there will necessarily be symptoms of heat and fullness, and cooling and fire-reducing herbs can be used, such as large doses of Qingyin Decoction and Yiyuan Powder. </p>
<p>In cases of exuberant damp-heat, with vexation and a preference for coolness, a firm pulse and abdominal fullness, or pure bright red diarrhea, it is advisable to use Qingliang Decoction or Huangqin and Shaoyao Decoction, or Xianglian Pill, or Hejian Shaoyao Decoction. If the heat is severe, large doses of Qingyin Decoction or Yincheng Decoction should be given. If these remedies do not yield results after several doses, one must consider nourishing the spleen and kidneys.</p>
<p>For dysentery accompanied by fever, it seems to belong to fire and should be treated with cooling methods. However, signs of true heat may not necessarily present with fever; instead, dysentery can harm vital essence and blood, leading to yin deficiency and water loss, resulting in heat and agitation. If there is latent fire in a weak condition, and the pulse feels strong, it is advisable to add or reduce Yin Decoction or Baoyin Decoction. If the pulse is fundamentally weak and there is purely virtual fire, fire should not be treated; one should focus on strengthening water and supplementing yin, using San Yin Decoction or Liuwei or Bawuwei Pills. If yin is strong and counteracting yang causes external heat, it is necessary to use Weiguan Decoction and Yougui Decoction.</p>
<p>When dysentery first occurs, if the vital Qi is still strong, or if it is due to overeating, leading to stagnation of food and drink, with symptoms of firm, painful fullness and both Qi and pulse being firm, one can first eliminate the accumulation, which will stop the dysentery itself. Qingqi Decoction, Shenyoupill, or Baishun Pill should be prescribed. Alternatively, using Chi Jin Dou for mild purgation can be effective, as pain diminishes with the alleviation of constipation. However, careful evaluation of these symptoms is essential before applying these treatments.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one assumes that diarrhea caused by deficiency and cold in the spleen and kidneys can be treated with this medicine and other cold and cooling agents, and in doing so, they further weaken the original Yang, it is likely that the situation will become irretrievable. Therefore, great caution is necessary. </p>
<p>Locking the mouth and not eating is the most dangerous symptom of diarrhea, yet it has not been clearly distinguished since ancient times. Observing what Danxi said: &quot;Locking the mouth in diarrhea is due to excessive heat in the stomach.&quot; One should take a decoction of huanglian (Coptis), and ginseng, sipping it throughout the day. If one vomits and then eats again, just a sip, swallowing it would be good. People are unaware of this and instead use warming and sweet medicines, akin to fire aiding fire, therefore worsening stagnation. </p>
<p>There are also instances where one mistakenly takes a hot and toxic medicine that offends the stomach, which should be clarified and the poison expelled. This is what Danxi referred to. The distinction of locking the mouth is very subtle; is it merely due to excessive heat in the stomach that one believes huanglian can treat it all? Locking the mouth occurs because food cannot enter. Although there may be evidence of excess heat, deficiency and cold of the spleen and stomach are more common. </p>
<p>If one locks the mouth due to food stagnation in the stomach, there will certainly be distention in the chest and abdomen, or one may experience pain. In such cases, one should resolve the stagnation and eliminate the accumulation, so when the accumulation is removed, food can enter again. This can be achieved with herbs such as Qing, Chen, Zha, and Pu. </p>
<p>If one locks the mouth due to constrained heat in the stomach, the internal organs must be quite heated, with a pulse that is rapid and strong. In this case, one should drain fire and eliminate the heat evil, allowing food to enter again, using herbs like Qin, Lian, Zhi, and Bo. In all these instances, it is the evil that accumulates within that causes the actual symptom of locking the mouth.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

Since there is no distension, it is not due to accumulation; and since there is no true heat, it is not due to fire. Without accumulation and without fire, yet food cannot enter—what is the reason? It is due to the organ&#39;s inability to receive. The inability to receive arises from two causes: one is the weakness of the spleen&#39;s energy, which may result in vomiting, nausea, or aversion to food odors, leading to discomfort; or a feeling of hunger without the ability to eat, leaving the stomach empty and awaiting distress. This is because the middle burner is not functioning, thus preventing food from entering, and the responsibility lies with the spleen.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The weakness of the kidney qi causes the gate of life to be unable to warm, leading to the large intestine&#39;s inability to consolidate and the small intestine&#39;s failure to transform, thus hindering the stomach qi&#39;s movement. This indicates a loss of control in the lower jiao, and the source of transformation is ungoverned; the responsibility lies with the kidney. To strengthen the middle jiao, one must use herbs such as ginseng, white astragalus, dried ginger, and licorice. To bolster the lower jiao, one must use substances like cooked rehmannia, aconite, wuzhuyu (Evodia), and cinnamon. When the spleen and kidneys are strong, food naturally enters, and the principle is clear as it resonates like an echo. My experience in this matter cannot be overstated. Danxi&#39;s use of huanglian (coptis) and the notion of using fire to assist fire, and stagnation to increase stagnation is primarily focused on the concept of true fire, showing merely a one-sided perspective. This constrains human intelligence and life force; their interrelationship is significant and should not be treated lightly. </p>
<p>In cases of prolonged diarrhea with yang deficiency, or when excessive cold attacks lead to the depletion of the spleen and kidney essence, resulting in constant looseness, the original source is already damaged.

<p>　　　　　痢病治法</p>
<p>　　凡人夏秋感暑热之气，患痢便血，一日间至百十次不止者，至危急也。苟用凉药以止血，利药以攻邪，俱非善法。我有神方，可以救急援危，而又不损伤气血，痢止身亦健也。方用援绝神丹：白芍、当归各二两，枳壳、槟榔、甘草各二钱，滑石末三钱，广木香、萝卜子各一钱，水煎服。一剂轻，二剂止，三剂全愈。此方妙在用白芍、当归至二两之多，则肝血有余，不去制克脾土，则脾气有生发之机，自然大肠有传导之化。加之枳壳、槟榔、萝卜子，俱逐秽去积之神药，尤能于补中用攻。<a id="orig-125p" href="#trans-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescription from the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Treatment Method for Dysentery</strong>  </p>
<p>When a person is affected by the heat of summer and autumn, suffering from dysentery with blood, experiencing up to a hundred or more bouts in a day, it is truly a critical situation. If one were to use cooling medicine to stop the bleeding or purging medicine to attack the evil, it would not be a good method. I have a miraculous recipe that can rescue from emergency and danger without harming the vital energy and blood, allowing the dysentery to stop while also keeping the body healthy. </p>
<p>The recipe uses the &quot;Divine Aid Pill&quot;: two taels each of white peony and angelica, two qian each of bitter orange peel, areca nut, and licorice, three qian of talc powder, one qian each of wide wood fragrant and radish seeds, boiled in water and taken as a decoction. One dose is light, two doses stop the condition, and three doses lead to complete recovery. </p>
<p>The brilliance of this recipe lies in using such a large amount of white peony and angelica at two taels, which ensures there is enough liver blood. By not depleting or overcoming the spleen and earth element, there arises an opportunity for the spleen&#39;s energy to rejuvenate, naturally allowing the large intestine to facilitate its functions. In addition, the bitter orange peel, areca nut, and radish seeds all serve as excellent medicines to eliminate impurities and remove accumulation, particularly effective in supplementary remedies combined with attack.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The substances talc, licorice, and wood incense, when harmonized between slow and fast, can effectively eliminate stagnation without causing any internal issues. For mild dysentery, such a large amount is unnecessary; halving the dosage will also yield results. There is no need to differentiate between red and white or between pain and no pain; all are effective.</p>
<p>The symptoms of dysentery often arise from the heat and humidity of summer, aggravated by atmospheric moisture from rain and dew. The discharge may appear mixed, resembling blood and pus; in severe cases, it can be as bad as leaking roofs or frozen fish, accompanied by urgency, heaviness, and pain, with a strong desire to defecate but inability to do so, or defecation without relief. It may occur dozens or even hundreds of times day and night, leaving one gasping, waiting for death.</p>
<p>If the disorder is abruptly halted, one may die instantly; if not controlled, danger remains ever-present. Attempts to replenish vital energy may worsen the evil qi, while efforts to clear heat may exacerbate the downward flow. At this moment, only a method that follows the situation can be employed. If it is suspected that one is already deficient in energy and blood, further purging will surely lead to death. It is not understood that as long as the evil qi persists, the vital qi will remain unsettled. The ancients said: &quot;There is no stopping method for dysentery,&quot; and this statement is not in vain.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>方用白芍、当归各三两，萝卜子一两，枳壳、槟榔、甘草、车前子各三钱，水煎服，一剂即止，二剂全安，可用饮食矣。此方之奇，全在用白芍、当归。盖水泻最忌当归之滑，而痢疾最喜其滑也。芍药味酸，入肝以平木，使木不敢再侵脾土；又有枳壳、槟榔，消逐其湿热之邪；又加车前分利其水湿，而又不耗真阴之水，所以功胜于茯苓也。尤奇在用萝卜子一味，世多不解。盖萝卜子味辣而能逐邪去湿，且又能上下通达。消食利气，使气行于血分之中，助归、芍以生新血，而袪荡其败瘀也。少加甘草以和中，则无过烈之患。此奏功之神奇，实有妙理耳。　　血痢有腹痛不痛之分。<a id="orig-127p" href="#trans-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The formula includes three taels of white peony and angelica, one tael of radish seeds, and three qian each of bitter orange peel, betel nut, licorice, and plantain seeds, boiled in water and taken as a decoction. One dose is sufficient; after two doses, one is completely at ease, and can return to normal diet. The uniqueness of this formula lies in the use of white peony and angelica. Water-dampness most abhors the slippery nature of angelica, whereas dysentery favors it. Peony has a sour taste that enters the liver to pacify wood, so that it dares not invade the spleen-earth again. Additionally, there are bitter orange and betel nut to dispel damp-heat, along with plantain seeds to promote the flow of dampness without depleting true kidney yin, thus this formula is even more effective than poria. Particularly remarkable is the inclusion of radish seeds, a point often overlooked by many. Radish seeds have a spicy flavor that can dispel evils and eliminate dampness, and they also promote communication both upwards and downwards. They aid digestion and facilitate qi movement within the blood, assisting angelica and peony to generate new blood and eliminate stagnation. A little licorice is added to harmonize the formula, thus avoiding excessive potency. The remarkable efficacy of this preparation indeed contains profound principles. Blood dysentery can be differentiated by the presence or absence of abdominal pain.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For pain, it is due to great heat. Use one tael each of Ligusticum and white peony, three qian of Coptis, two qian each of bitter orange peel and radish seed, one qian of licorice, and decoct in water for consumption. For those without pain, it is due to cold. Use three qian each of white peony and Ligusticum, two qian of radish seed, and one qian each of bitter orange peel, betel nut, and licorice, and decoct in water for consumption. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said: blood dysentery arises from the liver channel invading the spleen and earth element. Although this is due to the spleen’s dampness compounded by summer heat and concealed injury from fruits, it ultimately arises because the liver wood is too strong, overpowering the spleen earth. To remedy this, use white peony and Ligusticum to nourish the liver and subdue the wood. When the liver wood is nourished, it will not attack the spleen earth, allowing the earth to be nourished and thus curing the blood dysentery. </p>
<p>Even though blood dysentery can be categorized by pain or no pain, it essentially involves fire evils accompanied by dampness. Logically, it should be treated similarly to prescriptions for diarrhea with Atractylodes and Plantago, and must be approached with caution regarding pain or no pain. The two prescriptions may be adjusted for efficacy; there is no need to fear strict classifications, as one treats pain and the other non-pain. Fire evils with dampness dwell in the intestines and stomach; if they cannot descend promptly, they inevitably lead to urgency and heaviness. Using Ligusticum and white peony will facilitate smooth excretion, allowing fire evils to descend without cessation, while harmonizing the liver wood and aiding the spleen earth.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a></p></div>

<p>Combine these six ingredients, crushing Ku Shen and the other two into a fine powder, and boil the white onion, Dou Chi, and pepper in five sheng of water until only three sheng remain. Add a pinch each of the ground Ku Shen and other powders into this liquid, adjusting the temperature to that of the human body.

It is best to remain lying down for an extended period without getting up. In case of urgency, one should expel it in a clean place; there should appear a maggot-like substance similar to a white horse tail with a black head, which indicates effectiveness. In severe cases, if there is considerable difficulty in the anus, take a peach twig, wrap the head, and use the prepared juice at a slightly warm temperature to cauterize, ensuring it is approximately thirty degrees above the spine; this will lead to healing, proving to be remarkably effective.</p>
<p>Regarding another method, Cui’s observation states: During the Jin dynasty, many suffered from infestation that corroded the internal organs, visible along the spine, leading to pus and blood discharge, causing limb pain, weakness in the arms and legs, nocturnal restlessness, loss of color, shoulder and hip pain, and swelling in face and limbs.

<p>Prepare by boiling in water. An alternative formulation excludes Cinnamon and Licorice, substituting with Bitter Orange. The key is to use Peony and Licorice to alleviate abdominal pain. If there is heat with pain, add Scutellaria; if there is cold with pain, add Ginger or Cinnamon. Use Aromatic Wood and Areca Nut to move Qi and relieve heaviness in the lower abdomen. For issues in the Qi aspect, add Bitter Orange and Talcum for wider intestines; for blood issues, add Angelica and Peach Kernel to harmonize the blood. Use Gentian and Soapberry to expel intestinal wind, while Scutellaria and Coptis clear heat and toxins. White Atractylodes and Aged Tangerine Peel harmonize the stomach; Poria and Alisma drain dampness; Gardenia and Bitter Orange relieve accumulation. If vomiting occurs, add Gypsum, Aged Tangerine Peel, Gardenia, and Ginger Juice. If after dysentery the heaviness persists, remove Areca and Bitter Orange, switch to Scutellaria, and add Lonicera to lift it. For those with deficiency, reduce Scutellaria, Coptis, and Rhubarb; for Qi deficiency, add White Atractylodes, Astragalus, and Sand Ginger; for blood deficiency, add Chuang, Angelica, Donkey-hide Gel, Cedar Leaf, and Dry Ginger. This formula promotes blood circulation and harmonizes Qi, deeply in line with the principles of the classics.</p>

<p>For the initial treatment of dysentery, if there is first the onset of chills and fever with a headache, and blood changes in the middle leading to frequent bouts of red dysentery, the following formula is prescribed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xi Xin (Asarum) 8 drachmas</li>
<li>Qian Niu (Wrapped in cloth, baked until cooked) 4 drachmas</li>
<li>Ma Huang (Ephedra) 3 parts</li>
<li>Guan Gui (Cinnamon twig) 3 parts</li>
<li>Xiong Dan (Sichuan lovage) 2 taels</li>
<li>Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) 2 taels</li>
<li>Gao Ben (Ligusticum) 5 qian</li>
<li>Du Huo (Angelica) 5 qian</li>
<li>Jie Geng (Platycodon) 5 qian</li>
<li>Fang Feng (Siler) 5 qian</li>
<li>Bai Shao (White peony) 5 qian</li>
<li>Bai Zhi (Angelica dahurica) 5 qian</li>
<li>Dan Pi (Moutan) 1 part</li>
<li>Gan Cao (Licorice) 1 part</li>
</ul>
<p>Machinate these into a fine powder. Every dose is 2 qian, taken with warm soup prepared outside of meal times, and consume alongside the dregs to counteract heat. If, after two or three doses, the chills and fever persist, the subsequent prescription should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Huan Zhen Powder</strong></p>
<p>For the treatment of toxic dysentery when first onset includes chills and fever, take the previously mentioned formula. Once the chills and fever have subdued and the red dysentery has decreased, then this Huan Zhen Powder should be introduced. However, if the chills and fever do not recede and the red dysentery continues, do not take this medicine.</p>
<p>Five He Zi (Terminalia) should be wrapped in flour and baked until cooked; they should not be raw or burnt. Remove the flour and while still hot, bite through the He Zi, discarding the pit but retaining the skin and drying it out.</p>
<p>Crush and sieve into a fine powder. For each dose, take 2 qian and mix it with 1.5 bowls of rice soup, reducing it to 1 bowl. Consume on an empty stomach with the dregs. If one expectorates a bit of saliva, that is even better. After taking several doses, the large intestine will gradually calm down, and upon evacuation, reduce further consumption. Follow up with the third medicinal approach to consolidate the large intestine. If the previous medicine has not reduced the intense heat and bloody dysentery, do not take this medicine.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: when there is stagnation in the lower abdomen, focus on the Foot Taiyin meridian.

One should observe the symptoms of excess and deficiency, heat and cold, and treat accordingly. For urgency and heaviness, use He Gu and Wai Guan points.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Movements</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials for Health Preservation&quot; states: for the treatment of dysentery through guided movements, clench the perineum, stand with feet together, concentrate your spirit with your gaze, hang down both fists straight, draw in your abdomen and raise your shoulders, using your mind to pull up your energy. Inhale, allowing three breaths without interruption, and direct the energy upwards to stop the diarrhea. </p>
<p>First, circulate energy to gather and consolidate it before pushing it through the Large Intestine, allowing for the flow to release heat, then draw it back and focus on the navel, seeking tranquility and waiting for the diarrhea to stabilize, supplementing energy as needed. </p>
<p>Another method is: push open the Lung Meridian, releasing through the nine bends of the Large Intestine; then rise with Kidney water to cleanse the Lung Meridian. </p>
<p>For mouth-related dysentery: push from the heart to the kidneys, envisioning Kidney water rising to the crown of the head to cleanse the heart, restoring balance in the navel and practicing the circulation method. </p>
<p>For summer heat-induced dysentery: circulate water to cleanse the Lung Meridian, then push through the nine bends of the Large Intestine; after stopping the diarrhea, focus on the navel for recovery. </p>
<p>The method of gathering energy: the Earth represents the original essence. With a focused heart, nourish in the Earth, letting all senses return to the origin; concentrate the heart for a long time, and you will feel the true essence always present, at which point you may use your mind to circulate energy.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of practice involves raising the intent upwards, circulating within the processes of nature, moving from left to right. First, cultivate the dantian, gathering and releasing, releasing and then gathering again, returning to the original state. Do not stray from this, and the mind will return to the truth.</p>
<p>As for the method of circulating the whole body: first establish stability and guard the center, and once the techniques are mastered, perform circulation throughout the body to disperse stagnant energy in the limbs. The practice begins with movement at the dantian, expanding from small to large and then back to small, ascending sequentially to the Xuanzhi point, circling around the left arm, and descending to the Quqi and Neiguan points, tracing the palm and fingertips, circling the back of the wrist, ascending to the elbow, shoulder well, and Dachui, then moving down to the tailbone, and returning upward, passing over the Yuzhen, surpassing the Kunlun, above the facial area, and descending the Magpie Bridge to reach the stomach, crossing the dantian to the Yuzhu, then circulating to the right leg, passing the knee, penetrating through the Xiaolao point to the top of the foot and to the fingertips, turning at the Yongquan, rising at the heel, passing over the Yingu, connecting to the tailbone, and circling to the crown of the head. Following the descent from the Magpie Bridge, similarly send energy down the left leg as done on the right, then ascending through the Niwan and Xuanzhi on the right side, illuminating the left hand, turning over the shoulder and back, channeling through Kunlun and then down to gather yuanqi. In this way, the meridians throughout the body will become unimpeded, slowly revolving. As the mind directs, the energy naturally follows.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Medical Case</h3>
<p>According to the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot;: In the winter of the Gui-Mao year, in the Bai Shu household, there was an old man with a dusty face and a notably weak spirit. He had been suffering from a long-standing case of rectal prolapse, had not found relief from medicines, and was also experiencing both red and white purulent dysentery, accompanied by a feeling of urgency and heaviness in the abdomen; there was more white than red, and he could not endure the pain in search of a cure. I said: This is not due to meat and rich foods but rather from a diet high in vegetables or irregular eating habits. Though the weather is cold, his clothing remains thin; he is unable to resist and his intestines have fallen due to cold. The true qi cannot be retained, and the bodily form is not consolidated, resulting in the blood being loose and slipping. This is due to a failure of cold and slippery qi to hold firm, causing the bodily form to descend. I will use a medicinal powder made from the skin of the haritaki fruit to relieve his prolapse and eliminate the slippery condition; its slightly sour taste will help to consolidate and raise the qi. I will administer a strongly warming medicinal formula to dispel the cold and or restore yang; using qi-replenishing herbs will elevate yang, enhance qi, and provide stability.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: As I turned over fifty, I suffered from a blockage in the lower abdomen during the summer, experiencing mild pain in the belly and dark-colored excretions. There was frequent heaviness, a significant reduction in appetite, and occasional slight fever. Upon examining the pulse, it was found to be string-like and deficient, slightly rapid yet somewhat elongated, without being overly floating. Both hands had equal strength, and I observed a substantial decrease in vitality. I concluded that this was not merely a blockage but a result of worry, with heart blood deficiency and weak spleen qi. Therefore, I prescribed ginseng and atractylodes as the main ingredients, with angelica, tangerine peel as assistants, and fried ligusticum, white peony, and poria as adjuncts. Given the intense heat, I added a little coptis, and after two days, the patient was at ease.</p>
<p>As for Chief Mei, over thirty years old and well-nurtured, he suffered blockage in the lower abdomen during the summer and autumn, experiencing significant pain. Someone advised him to take single-boiled dried ginger, which alleviated the pain temporarily. However, the pain recurred shortly thereafter, and again he took the ginger, which provided relief. Consequently, he consumed three pounds of dried ginger over time. After eight days, I examined him again; the left pulse was string-like and somewhat stronger, while the right pulse was string-like yet slightly weaker. The pulse felt tense upon further inspection. I suggested that he must have overeaten and consumed excessive cold substances, hence it should be treated as a deficiency of cold. Due to the excessive intake of dried ginger, I prescribed the Four Substances Decoction omitting rehmannia, adding ginseng, atractylodes, tangerine peel, wine-red flower, poria, and peach kernel, decocted with fresh ginger juice, and after a month, he was stable.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a></p></div>

In early autumn, it was still hot, and she suffered from a stagnation below, experiencing only dull abdominal pain, which was worse at night than during the day, preventing her from sleeping entirely. Her appetite had slightly decreased, and she felt dry in her mouth without thirst. She had already taken two doses of a remedy for dysentery. Upon examination, both of her pulses were weak and irregular, and she appeared very fatigued. Her food intake was significantly reduced, so I prescribed the Four Substance Decoction, increasing the amount of white atractylodes as the main ingredient, with dried tangerine peel as an aid, and after taking a dozen doses, she felt settled.</p>
<p>Brother Zheng from Pujiang was nearly sixty years old and was a person cared for and receiving assistance. In the middle of summer, he had long suffered from stagnation below and also had overexerted himself in sexual activity. One evening, while going to the toilet, he suddenly relaxed, his eyes opened without light, he urinated involuntarily, sweated profusely, and felt as if his throat was being pulled and sawed, with very faint breathing; his pulse was large and erratic, showing no clear position, which was very alarming. I happened to be there and quickly ordered ginseng paste to be prepared, and also instructed to moxibustion at the Qihai point with moxa cones the size of a little finger—up to eighteen cones, he regained movement in his right hand; after three more cones, his lips began to move slightly. The ginseng paste was ready, and I gave him one cup. By midnight, after consuming three cups, he could move his eyes; after finishing two pounds, he was able to speak and asked for congee.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: An elderly man, aged seventy, had a pale face, with thin, rapid pulses; only his stomach pulse was deep and slippery. After drinking white wine, he developed dysentery, passing blood with thin pus and had abdominal pain, with difficult urination and urgency. I prescribed ginseng and atractylodes as the main ingredients, with licorice, talc, areca nut, wood incense, and common atractylodes as assistants, and gave him twenty-five pills of Baohe Wan. The next day, all symptoms had diminished, but he still had difficulty urinating, so I administered Yiyuan San, and he was stable.</p>
<p>Zhao Lidao, nearing fifty, had a weak constitution and frequently lost his temper. In July, during the intense heat of summer and amidst great hunger, his family could not quickly provide food, which led to a great anger. Two days later, he developed stagnation and had difficulty with bowel movements, feeling thirsty, so he mixed cold water with honey to drink, which provided relief, and the stagnation gradually eased over five to seven days. When I was called to examine him, the pulse was slightly stronger but not rapid. I ordered him to stop drinking honey water. When thirsty, I instructed him to drink a decoction of ginseng and white atractylodes, along with Yiyuan San, and the stagnation continued to improve. </p>
<p>After seven to eight days, he felt very fatigued and began to belch; I knew this was due to prolonged diarrhea leading to Yin deficiency, so I instructed him to continue with the previous medication. However, the stagnation had not yet ceased, and he was still drinking honey. After three days, the belching had not stopped. Many attributed this to improper medication and suggested ginger and fuzi (prepared aconite) be added. I said, &quot;Tonics do not have immediate effects; fuzi is not for nourishing Yin, and taking it could be fatal.&quot; They said, &quot;He drank a lot of cold water—could that be the cause of the cold?&quot; I replied, &quot;In such intense heat, drinking something cool isn’t the same as being cold—do not doubt too much, wait a few days; when the medicine takes effect, it will naturally stop.&quot; After another four days, the belching ceased and the bowel issues were also resolved.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chen Zeren was nearly seventy years old, a person of considerable substance. He had a lingering cough for a long time, which occasionally ceased. In early autumn, he suffered from a blockage in his lower abdomen, reducing his appetite significantly, leading to vomiting after five or seven days. He summoned me to examine him; his pulse was notably large, and many thought it difficult. I said: A person who is thin can still be treated. I administered a ginseng and white atractylodes decoction along with a major tonic pill to replenish his blood, and he was stable after seven days.</p>
<p>My paternal uncle, robust in both form and complexion, was suffering from intermittent fever and also dysentery. He relied on his strength and ability to eat, without any caution. One day, he called for me and said: I am healthy and able to eat, yet I have profuse sweating; can you stop this sweat? I replied: The intermittent fever is not the sweating that hinders recovery; what is concerning is your strength and ability to eat. This is not dysentery. Your stomach is hot and well-digested; the spleen is struggling with food residue, and the condition has become severe. At this time, it is wise to regulate your diet to nourish your stomach energy, minimizing exposure to wind and cold, and wait for the sweat to pass for stability. </p>
<p>He said: People say that one cannot die from dysentery while still able to eat; since I can eat, what is there to worry about? I replied: If one can eat but has dysentery, it indicates that the stomach energy is not yet affected, hence the claim of not dying. It is not about overindulging in eating without selection. Ignoring my advice, he indulged in excessive eating and also consumed fruits. After a month of this, he sought treatment, but it was too late to intervene. After another month, he passed away. The Inner Canon states that arrogance is not to be discussed in reason and is a disease that cannot be treated; how true this is!<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a></p></div>

He was then asked to check the pulse and diagnosed it as a type of cold dysentery. The prescribed method involved using freshly harvested lotus root segments, finely ground, to be taken with hot wine. Following this method, with the root ground finely and mixed with wine for several doses, he soon recovered.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Correct Transmission of Medicine,&quot; it is stated: There was a man nearing fifty who suffered from dysentery for more than a month in summer and autumn. Although he took medicine, he improved only slightly; his bowel movements had stopped, yet he could not eat, going to the toilet five to six times a day and also experiencing discomfort from prolapsed rectum for another half month, with no remedy proving effective. I remembered a formula passed down from my ancestors, which involved using a turtle from a pond. Following the method, I prepared it mainly with fresh ginger and a small piece of rock sugar, avoiding salt and sauces. After cooking it thoroughly, he consumed one or two bowls. Within three days, he did not need to go to the toilet, and from then on, his large intestine was functional, and the rectum returned to normal. This condition was likely due to a deficiency in the spleen, leading to a lack of nourishment for both the lungs and the large intestine. Thus, the large intestine was unable to function properly. The turtle, categorized as a shellfish and having an element of earth, is warm and can nourish the spleen and lungs. Moreover, the lungs, having been exposed to cold due to previous treatments involving bitter and cold herbs, now required warming. Therefore, ginger, which is spicy, was used to restore the lung&#39;s metal element, and the sweetness of rock sugar was employed to fortify the spleen&#39;s earth element. Once the lung energy was sufficient, the large intestine also became robust, allowing it to regain its function. Hence, the effectiveness of this method was evident.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li Yi from the Ministry of Rites suffered from blood dysentery, with a swollen chest and abdomen, an urge to defecate without result, and extreme fatigue in the limbs. This was due to a weakness of spleen qi, which could not hold the blood and restore it to its source. I treated him with a formula to tonify the middle and boost qi, adding Poria and Pinellia, and he gradually recovered. Later, due to anger, the previous symptoms reappeared. The left guan pulse was string-taut and floating, and upon palpation it was weak. This indicated a deficiency of the liver that could not store the blood, so I treated him with the Six-Flavor Pill, and he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Medicine of Ancient and Modern Times&quot; states: A patient suffering from dysentery and urgency precisely matches the symptoms of the purgative syndrome. I noted that the qi pulse was weak, and although the body appeared full, the complexion was pale and yellow, indicating past overeating had damaged the stomach. I then used ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and peony in more than ten doses. After three months, his stomach qi had improved somewhat, and I prescribed two doses of the purgative decoction, and he was at ease. If one does not first tonify, although they may recover, they will still feel exhausted.</p>
<p>A patient presented with a pale complexion and a string-taut pulse, the gastric pulse being deep and slippery. After consuming white liquor, he had dysentery with clear watery pus and blood, abdominal pain, difficulty urinating, and a feeling of urgency and heaviness in the lower abdomen. I used ginseng and white atractylodes as the main herbs, with licorice, talc, cardamom, betel nut, and bitter atractylodes as assistants, brewing a decoction and administering twenty pills of Baohuan Pill. The following day, his symptoms diminished, but he still had difficulty urinating. I prescribed several doses of Yiyuan Powder, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another patient suffered from dysentery with slight abdominal pain, passing dark brown stools, feeling heavy and frequent urges to defecate, reduced appetite, and slight fever. The pulse was string-taut and thin, seemingly rapid yet long; he showed a lack of vitality. I diagnosed this as arising from worry and distress, leading to heart blood deficiency and weak spleen qi. Using ginseng and atractylodes as the main herbs, with angelica, dried tangerine peel as ministers, and chuanxiong, peony, poria, and coptis as assistants, he recovered.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Essential Medical Texts&quot; states: Lady Sun Xiaoxiang, who suffered from dysentery for forty days, experienced dry mouth, fever, lack of appetite, abdominal bloating, and undigested food. There were those who argued that the invading heat did not harm the food. She took over thirty prescriptions of Xiang, Lian, Zhi Ke, Dou Kou, and Hou Po, but after five days of fasting, her life was in danger. When I was called to diagnose her, her pulse was large and rapid; upon palpation, it was clear that her abdominal pain subsided with pressure, and her urination was clear and smooth. This indicated that the fire was weak and could not generate earth, showing true cold internally but false heat externally. I urgently prepared a decoction of Fu Zi and Li Zhong Tang and administered it cold, leading to the relief of pain after one dose, and after six doses, her fever subsided and she was able to eat. After taking Ba Wei Wan for over twenty days, she recovered remarkably.</p>
<p>In Huaian County, the daughter of Lord Xu Tongsheng suffered from dysentery and abdominal pain, with a pulse that was weak and soft, indicative of qi deficiency unable to transform essence. Her urgency and heaviness were due to prolapse. I used Sheng Yang San Huo Tang for one dose, followed by ten doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which led to her recovery.</p>
<p>In the case of Wenxue Gu Weinan, he had dysentery for a month, with all medicines proving ineffective. I diagnosed him with both qi and blood deficiency, proposing a heavy supplementation. All medications for dysentery were halted. I prescribed ten doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang and, alongside that, twenty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi added with ginger and cinnamon, achieving a state of calm.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a></p></div>

He tried various remedies like Xiang, Lian, Zhi, and Pu for two months, but his condition did not improve. Upon examination, his pulse was slippery yet strong, indicating that he had lost his ability to expel. I used a combination of Xiang, Lian, Gui, Shao, Chenpi, and Zhihua, along with three qian of Dahuang, leading to a considerable expulsion of waste. His pulse remained strong, so I continued with the same prescription, considering the accumulation as substantial as fish intestines. After over ten days of treatment, he recovered.</p>
<p>The official Mao Ru initially had dysentery that presented with severe abdominal pain and gurgling sounds, leading to vomiting upon the sight of food. He had only taken Qinshi, Lian, Muxiang, Changpu, Huoxiang, Juhong, and Shaoyao. Later, someone administered Si Jun Zi Tang, which I found dubious but didn’t pursue further. He called for me at night for a diagnosis. Although his pulse was full and large, it felt weak under pressure, especially at the right wrist, where it was particularly soft. I deduced that the fire at the life gate was weak and could not generate Earth, thus he urgently needed Ren and Fu to restore Yang. Ru said: “If I only use Ren and Shu, can he recover?” I replied: “Without Gui and Fu, even with Ren and Shu, it would not benefit the illness. Moreover, the Spleen Earth is greatly deficient; deficiency requires to supplement the Mother, does it not? Thus, I prescribed five qian of Ren, one and a half qian of Fu, one qian of Paojiang, and three qian of Baizhu, administering three doses, after which vomiting ceased and he could eat congee. Further, I added Bu Zhong Yi Qi with ginger and Fu; after fourteen doses, he was able to attend to matters again.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Comprehensive Treatise&quot; states: A pregnant woman experienced both malaria and dysentery simultaneously, and was treated for more than two months. The malaria subsided, but the dysentery worsened, accompanied by abdominal pain and reduced appetite, prompting me to examine her again. I said: This is a condition of deficiency and cold. I prescribed a restorative formula to boost the central qi, adding ginger and cinnamon. After one dose, the dysentery improved significantly; after a second dose, however, the malaria symptoms intensified alarmingly. The host was frightened, but I reassured them: This is a good sign. The prior cessation of malaria indicated an extreme dominance of yin, causing yang to refrain from confrontation. Now, with a tonic for yang, the yang energy is fortified enough to contend with yin, thus helping yang&#39;s strength and allowing yin to recede. I added five grams of prepared aconite to the prescription, and both malaria and dysentery were cured. After taking a large restorative dose, three months later she gave birth to a son, and she was very healthy after childbirth.</p>

He experienced frequent bowel movements, one to two hundred times a day, unable to get out of bed. He laid coarse paper on his bedding, replacing it frequently, only able to drink water but unable to eat, suffering intensely with rectal pain that felt like being burned. He would flail his limbs, restless and miserable. I examined his pulse, which was tight and forceful, refusing to yield under pressure. I remarked: This condition signifies a mass of toxic fire, trapped within the intestines and stomach, burning fiercely. Immediate rescue is necessary; if delayed by two or three days, the intestines and stomach will rot away.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Then, four taels of rhubarb, two taels each of coptis and licorice were put into a large sand pot for decoction, taken while boiling, and consumed. After taking the medicine, the person was somewhat calm for a moment, but shortly thereafter, the restlessness returned for a whole day and night. After taking more than twenty bowls, the rhubarb had completely dissolved, and the coptis and licorice were boiled down to dryness. The next day, the patient again requested the previous medicine. After the diagnosis, I saw the pulse was somewhat softer and knew the illness could be cured, but I opted for an urgent method instead of urgent medicine. Thus, I changed to four taels each of raw rehmannia and ophiopogon, and separately extracted their fresh juices. I then added one tael each of powdered trichosanthes, peony bark, red peony, and licorice, and decocted them into a large bowl of harmonious fluid to drink. Because the onset was fierce, all bodily fluids had been depleted, and one must wait for the diarrhea to stop before nourishing the blood and fluids, as recovering from such depletion would take time. Now that the pulse had softened, the fiery pathogen had retreated; if one did not treat the diarrhea, it would stop on its own. How could one rely on lubricating and stagnating medicines without urgent action? After taking this medicine, indeed the diarrhea ceased completely, leaving only a little residual froth. On the third day, the patient craved tofu soup. On the fourth day, I gradually introduced clear broth from old warehouse rice. Slowly adjusting over ten days, he was eventually able to digest grains. It was also noted that the presence of stomach qi must not overlook this urgent matter at hand.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chen Ruming was suffering from dysentery, with fever as if steamed, heavy and unable to eat, feeling extremely unwell. On the third day, in critical condition, he requested my diagnosis. His pulse was rapid and considerably hollow, with the pulse at the wrist being especially strong. I said: This is a case where two illnesses coincide at one time. Internally, there is damp-heat combining with the external heat of the season, wanting to manifest as dysentery, yet he remained unaware, having also engaged in excessive sexual activity, which contributed to being suddenly attacked by cold. Hence, the fever, heaviness, and inability to eat are all related to the external invasion of the Lesser Yin Kidney channel. When the Lesser Yin is affected, one should expect diarrhea of clear fluids. This is because the damp-heat in the intestines has already boiled into a foul form resembling pig liver or fish brain; thus, although the color changes, the diarrhea remains the same. If I were to administer a remedy for dysentery at this point, it would be of no help. I hastily gave him a dose of Mahuang, Fuzhu, and Xixin Decoction to dispel the external pathogen, and after sweating, his heat slightly diminished. Then, I used Fuzhu Lizhong Decoction as well, giving two doses; the heat receded, and he felt lighter and was able to eat. I switched to taking Huanglian Lizhong Pills, and by the tenth day, he was completely well.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ye Maoqing, a young boy, suffered from dysentery and was instructed not to eat. He had a fever for more than ten days, with continuous vomiting. Upon examining his pulse, it was surging upward without a root; the pulse in his feet showed the same condition. I told his father: &quot;This is not a case of dysentery caused by dietary restriction; rather, it is a sign that the stomach&#39;s qi is about to fail. In dysentery from dietary restriction, there is virtual heat in the stomach, stagnating and not dispersing, hence the sensation of fullness without appetite. The treatment should focus on nourishing deficiency and clearing heat. This condition arises from the harm of bitter and cold medicines, which cannot accept food; thus, warm nourishment is the only remedy.&quot; </p>
<p>I then administered two doses of the &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; (Regulating the Center Decoction). In no time, he experienced ten or more bouts of dysentery, and the surroundings became messy. Maoqing feared that the medicine was inappropriate for his condition and requested a different prescription. I replied: &quot;My aim is to first save the qi of the stomach from failing, and I am not treating the dysentery directly. Dysentery involves the large and small intestines, which are quite distant in the body; even a miraculous pill cannot instantly change the stool. Encouraging it to come out quickly with medicine is indeed a good thing—how could that be doubted?&quot; </p>
<p>So, I continued the previous medicine for another two days. His condition greatly improved; he began to feel hungry without vomiting, and the dysentery&#39;s intensity decreased. Four days later, he only passed damp remnants. After restoring the Qi with nourishing methods and regulating his condition for ten days, he fully recovered. This illustrates that in children with dysentery, even if they have consumed food that harms the stomach, it is rare to find accumulated heat inside. Thus, it is particularly inadvisable to lightly apply the standard methods for treating dysentery.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Pu Junyi fell ill with dysentery. At first, he had an outward pathogen that had not yet dispersed, but mistakenly used ginseng and atractylodes to strengthen the exterior, allowing the pathogenic qi to penetrate deeply. He also mistakenly took huanglian to cool and resolve heat, and da huang to purge, which he did for more than a month, resulting in his stomach qi being out of order, with over a hundred watery stools in one day. One evening, he vomited three to five bowls of the yellow lotus medicine, and after vomiting two or three times, his stomach and intestines seemed to become one. The pylorus and the lower orifice were wide open without obstruction; not only did the congee and drink flow straight out, but even ginseng extract, once swallowed, rushed down immediately from the intestines. In this critical situation, various friends and relatives asked me: &quot;Is there no fear in this condition?&quot; I replied, &quot;With the medicine I’m using, there is something to rely on. Am I unaware of the severity of this illness? But there is no one else to depend on; I will temporarily calm him down while doing my best to inform his supporters.&quot; Thus, I prescribed a large dose of the Four Gentlemen Decoction, decocted with powdered red stone fat and Yu Yu grain, and continuously administered it. After taking it, the rate of diarrhea diminished slightly, but he experienced unbearable abdominal pain. Junyi said: &quot;Although I had much diarrhea before, there was no pain. After taking this medicine, the pain increased; it cannot be taken again.&quot; I replied: &quot;This is precisely the saying that when it flows, there is no pain; when there is pain, it does not flow. If it does not flow, it is dangerous; if it hurts, it is safe. Why would one not prefer to feel pain?&quot; I continued with the previous medicine. Once the condition improved significantly, I then used an increased amount of the Four Gentlemen Decoction with more than ten doses of poria to ensure complete safety.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a></p></div>

The liver pulse is slightly slow and causes intestinal dysentery, making it easier to treat. The kidney pulse is slightly rapid; it is submerged and leads to blood in the stool. If the blood causes body heat, the person will die. Heart and liver involvement also leads to blood in the stool; if both organs are affected, it can be treated. The pulse that is small, submerged, and difficult indicates intestinal dysentery. If the body is hot, the person will die. If heat persists for seven days, death occurs. **Note:** The spleen is a Yin organ, situated in the center, receiving the force of the three Yangs. When this energy presses upward, the pulse becomes externally raised, and when it depresses downward, it results in intestinal dysentery. However, the spleen represents the utmost Yin; despite being influenced by Yang heat, it self-resolves over time. If the Yang heat depletes the Yin of the organs, causing the liver’s blood and energy to leak and weaken, the pulse becomes small and slow. The liver governs blood storage, and although it suffers from Yang evil, it remains relatively easy to treat. The kidneys govern essence, serving as the source of essence and blood. With Yang heat applied, it dilutes the kidneys, leading to blood in the stool. The pulse is small due to Yin-blood damage. Heat exhausts the kidneys, thus the pulse appears submerged and rapid.

If both organs are ill, the Yin blood is strong enough to combat the Yang pathogenic influences, which makes it a treatable condition. A weak and deep pulse indicates damage due to insufficient Yang. In cases of body heat, the Yang is abundant while the Yin is exhausted. Those who die after seven days have depleted the Yin energy of the six organs. This is a serious and persistent illness; the Yang energy converges directly with the Yin, resulting in damage to the Yin energy, hence the weak and strained pulse.

For great knot diarrhea, symptoms include urgency with a heavy feeling after defecation, repeated unsuccessful attempts, pain in the dorsal region, and difficulty urinating; this relates to the kidneys. In relation to the five types of diarrhea: the symptoms of the stomach, small intestine, and great knot can all be addressed with the Qingliang Yinzi to stop the diarrhea. The conditions of Jueyin and Shaoyin require separate treatments. For Jueyin symptoms, licorice is added to address the pain in the dorsal region, which is associated with the liver. The Inner Canon states that when the liver is in distress, sweet food should be consumed to ease it. The Shaoyin symptoms often involve urgency with a heavy feeling, hence the addition of rhubarb to promote expulsion, leading to relief. It also states that one should reduce the heaviness when necessary, and “what is below should be drawn out and exhausted.” There are also conditions related to the Taiyin and Yangming channels that suggest the administration of the Dachengqi decoction should be considered.

If diarrhea persists, this suggests long-standing residue in the intestines; add half a he of Glauber's salt to thoroughly eliminate the old residue and achieve recovery. The white diarrhea is associated with cold; blue, yellow, red, and black are all associated with heat. The color white from diarrhea corresponds to the lung’s color. When cold water is excessive, it suppresses fire, which fails to regulate metal, leading to an excess in the lung, hence the white coloration, similar to how turbid water settles into clear, bright ice.

Generally, if grains are digested, regardless of color or other symptoms, it signifies heat. Cold diarrhea with grain digestion has never been seen, as cold prevents the digestion of grains. Moreover, if heat is excessive and rapid, the transformation becomes abnormal, and grains cannot digest, leading to diarrhea—this can also occur.

Thus, when food is in the stomach, if it encounters the damp-heat evils from people, it naturally breaks down, turning into pus and blood. The heat is red, belonging to the fire of the heart. The dampness is yellow, belonging to the earth of the spleen. The dryness and stagnation is white, belonging to the metal of the lung. The scripture says: all obstructed qi belongs to the lung, indicating the transformation of dry metal. Wang Bing said: the constrained and urgent qi is used by metal. However, all diarrhea and dysentery involve dampness, and now if one speaks of dry qi, it indicates that the damp-heat is stronger within the intestines and stomach, causing heat to become stagnant, with dampness dominating, which leads to qi and fluids not being able to unfold, thus resulting in dryness in the intestines and stomach, making thirst unending.

This is because pungent and heating medicines can open up blockages in the intestines and stomach, aiding the flow of qi and fluids, moistening the dryness, and harmonizing the qi. Therefore, those with mild cases can recover, but those with severe blockages will worsen, and their condition may lead to death. This is also true for treating severe vomiting and diarrhea. In treating various forms of dysentery, it is best to use bitter and cold medicines, sometimes slightly supplemented with pungent and heating ones. Pungent and heating substances disperse and unblock, while bitter substances dry up moisture, and cold ones conquer heat, helping to restore the balance of qi. Medicines like Qian's fragrant linked pill are examples of this approach. Thus, for treating dysentery, Huanglian (Coptis) and Huangbai (Phellodendron) are primary medicines, emphasizing the treatment of damp-heat diseases with strong bitterness and coldness. However, the commonly used pungent and heating medicines, even poisonous substances, sometimes help treat various forms of vomiting, diarrhea, and dysentery because they effectively open up blockages. Yet, even though there may be some efficacy, they can also backfire and become toxic. When using very toxic medicines, they should only be considered when no better options are available, necessitated by the situation. Fortunately, there are effective medicines that, though not always yielding results, can be beneficial without harm. Why then use highly toxic medicines and risk additional complications?

The term \"pain\" can also mean a guest, signifying something that is lingering. A guest that causes heat in the lower abdomen, persisting for a long time, transforms into white through the action of metal. If there is dysentery that is both red and white, the red indicates a new accumulation stemming from heart fire; the white indicates an old accumulation due to lung metal. Therefore, red and white dysentery cannot be simply categorized as hot or cold; one should only differentiate between new and old for treatment. For example, in the case of abscesses starting with red blood, followed by the emergence of white pus, how can one attribute it only to cold? Yet the patient remains unconvinced. Liu Hejian often discussed this, stating that \"excess cold results in white,\" and thus recommends dried ginger and red shijinshi. While the Tao Hua pill may effectively treat dysentery, it may later lead to blood diseases. In cases of leukorrhea, directly using white peony root and dried ginger might resolve the leukorrhea, but it will inevitably cause difficulty in urination. Both treatments for diarrhea and leukorrhea should avoid the sudden use of harsh and hot drying medications. Applying such drying methods will deplete internal fluids, leading to a feeling of thirst; with thirst, urination becomes difficult, and difficult urination can lead to swelling of the feet, potentially progressing to a point of no return. For rectal hemorrhage, one can use the stomach-regulating Chenshi Decoction with the addition of angelica.

If the pathogenic energy has greatly receded but the righteous energy has not yet stabilized, it is necessary to provide nourishment. Moreover, regarding stopping diarrhea and dysentery, if the spleen and stomach are weak and unable to tolerate food, one cannot universally apply punitive medicines. If one nourishes the spleen qi, there will naturally be enough qi to take in food. The Qian family prescription, Yigong Powder, is appropriate. If one excessively craves food and injures the spleen and stomach, leading to abdominal distension and nausea, then do not stick to this principle; instead, it is advisable to use Tangerine Peel, Zhi Zhu Pill.

Urine refers to urination. The mention of blood with pus in the urine indicates the cause of the disease. The blood is obstructed due to stagnation of qi, leading to difficulty in both urination and defecation. The statement that qi flows and blood stops refers to the treatment method. Therefore, Hejian elucidates this idea by stating that harmonizing qi will alleviate the heaviness in the lower body and that medications such as cardamom, betel nut, and bitter orange should be used for this purpose. Hejian further states: \"When blood circulates, the discharge of pus from the bowels is self-healing; when qi is harmonized, the heaviness in the lower body is alleviated.\" He also states that if there is heaviness in the lower body, purgation is indicated; if there is abdominal pain, harmonization is recommended; if the body feels heavy, dampness must be expunged; if the pulse is taut, wind must be expelled; if pus and blood are thick and sticky, potent medications should be used to force them out; if the body feels cold and there is spontaneous sweating, warming medications should be administered; if wind pathogenic factors are trapped on the outside, sweating is necessary; if there is watery diarrhea resembling dysentery, warming should be applied.

One must consider both the color and symptoms to distinguish between cold and heat. Blood is affected by fire, and excess dampness can cause diarrhea.

The causes may include external factors of summer heat and dampness, internal injuries from alcoholic intake, excessive cooking or roasting, or emotional stress leading to tangible fire situations.

Sweating and purging are also considered part of this approach. Initially, if the original energy is strong, treatment can proceed. However, if after five to seven days the spleen and stomach are weak, one should focus on harmonizing and resolving issues, promoting urination, and eliminating food stagnation, as there can be no dysentery without accumulation. If the condition persists, medicines that invigorate Qi and blood may be added, such as Angelica, Bupleurum, Ledebouriella, and Atractylodes to elevate the energy. If symptoms are severe, one may use buckwheat husk, nutmeg, dragon bone, oyster shell, and chebula to consolidate and constrict. For those with reduced appetite, it is essential to specially adjust the spleen and stomach, as advancing food intake allows for natural harmonization of Qi and blood, since dysentery fundamentally relies on stomach Qi. If there is urgency with abdominal pain but no exterior signs, one should facilitate bowel movement. For a weak spleen that resists purging, one may either harmonize or directly uplift. If Qi sinks and symptoms resemble severe diarrhea, one should temporarily stop purging. If there is severe pain with slippery discharge, it indicates excess phlegm and heat, which should be treated with purging or uplifting methods. If phlegm is dissipated and heat is lowered, the large intestine will naturally consolidate; medical decisions should be based on pulse diagnostics. ### After Recovery After recovering from dysentery, treatments such as Sanbai Decoction, Liushen Pills, Zhi Zhuru Pills, and Taihe Soup are recommended. If there is swelling in the hands and feet or pain in the joints, it indicates residual blood stasis in the meridians, so purely using wind-dispelling remedies is not advisable.

Sometimes heat accumulates internally and is counteracted with cold substances and remedies, or cold accumulates internally and is countered with heat medicines and foods, leading to diarrhea caused by the clash of heat and cold. Whether it is dry or loose stools, with urgency and heaviness in the abdomen, the treatments include Wujici Pills or Xianglian Pills, or Lizhong Decoction with added Huanglian and Muxiang. ### General Discussion I perceive that dysentery often originates from issues with the spleen and kidneys. The spleen manages storage, and earth is the mother of all things; the kidneys govern storage, and water is the source of all things. Both organs are fundamental, and if treatment is insufficient, it leads to a deepening of the ailment. The root of the error lies in the unclear distinction between cold and heat, and between deficiency and excess. In recent discussions, there has been little to elaborate on, even in the works of ancient masters, which exhibit considerable bias. For instance, the \"Jufang\" and Fuan favor pungent and hot treatments, while Hejian and Danxi prefer bitter and cold remedies, showing a rigid adherence rather than a rounded understanding—how vastly different this is! Dysentery arises in the summer and autumn, associated with the heat of the season; seeking coolness leads to the excessive consumption of raw and cold items, which is due to human behavior. When one’s vitality is strong, it primarily results in heat accumulation from climatic factors; when weak, it results in excess cold caused by personal factors. The damp earth thrives in all seasons; if it derives from fire, there is an abundance of yang earth leading to damp heat as a disease, referred to as “Dunfu” in the classics. If it derives from water, there is a deficiency in yin earth leading to cold damp as a disease, referred to as “Bijian” in the classics."},{"anchor":"trans-74p","marker":"74p","type":"translation","text":"To speak of heat is to dismiss cold; to speak of cold is to neglect heat. Is this not an error in expression? Furthermore, to equate red with heat and white with cold is also not a definitive assertion. If red and white are both present, can it be said that they truly suffer from the same conditions of cold and heat? One must differentiate between them using evidence and the observation of color and pulse, and only then can cold and heat be clearly understood. It is essential to know that cold must be associated with deficiency, while heat must be associated with fullness. By detailing this deficiency and fullness, the distinction between cold and heat becomes clearer. A feeling of fullness, aversion to food, urgent pain, and fear of pressure indicate fullness; thirst that prompts drinking, a preference for coolness, and aversion to heat indicate heat. A strong and firm pulse indicates fullness; a rapid and slippery pulse indicates heat. Beyond this, everything else is surely cold and deficient. In cases of similarity, one should be particularly careful in observation. For instance, if one interprets thirst as a sign of true heat, they might not realize that in cases of diarrhea, there is a loss of bodily fluids; as fluids are depleted below, dryness occurs above. How can one not feel thirsty? Furthermore, one must differentiate between a preference for coolness and a preference for heat to understand deficiency and fullness. To consider abdominal pain as true heat might seem plausible, yet one may be unaware that dysentery originates from the organs, harming the intestines and stomach, with pus and blood pressing against the skin. How can there be no pain? One must further distinguish between the severity or urgency of the pain, whether pressure alleviates or exacerbates it, the yin and yang of the organs, the presence or absence of abdominal distension, and the strength or weakness of the pulse to ascertain deficiency and fullness."},{"anchor":"trans-75p","marker":"75p","type":"translation","text":"The yellowish-red color and the short quantity of urine indicate actual heat; however, one should understand that if fluid is lost through dysentery, urination must be lessened. When yin is depleted, the color changes. It is also essential to differentiate between the heat or lack of heat in the urine, the depletion or not of fluids, and the luster or lack thereof in color to discern between deficiency and excess. The urgency and heaviness in the abdomen indicate actual heat; nevertheless, if the qi is suppressed, then the storehouse cannot hold, and if yin is lost, then the gates do not close. It is also necessary to differentiate between the new or chronic nature of the disease, the strength or weakness of the condition, and the vigor or decline of the pulse to discern between deficiency and excess. In treatment, one must identify what pathogen has caused the damage and which organ is affected. If it is due to damp-heat, remove the damp-heat; if due to accumulation and stagnation, remove the accumulation; if related to qi and blood, harmonize them. New illnesses that are strong can be treated with common methods, while chronic illnesses that are deficient require different approaches. These are all standard methods and need no further explanation. It is particularly puzzling that among those suffering dysentery, nineteen out of ten have a deficiency, yet physicians treating dysentery rarely provide any supplementation. If the qi is inherently sinking and one continues to move the qi, does not the heaviness worsen? If the center is fundamentally deficient and weak, does attacking the accumulation not deplete the vital energy even further? When damp-heat injures the blood, one should naturally regulate the blood. If one pushes too hard, does it not further injure the blood? When fluids are exhausted, leading to thirst, one should stop the diarrhea."},{"anchor":"trans-76p","marker":"76p","type":"translation","text":"If we continue with infiltration of profits, will the essence not be wasted? The common practitioners of this world adhere strictly to the pain without remedy, claiming: \"Only when the pain stops can one seek to remedy it.\" They do not know that pain caused by emptiness only worsens with more attacks, leading to greater emptiness and pain. This stems from a lack of clarity on fundamental and peripheral issues; they only regard present ailments as tangible diseases, neglecting the intangible concerns of vital energy. Let me state the necessary proofs for supplementation: a weak pulse can be supplemented; a frail appearance can be supplemented; post-disease diarrhea can be supplemented; severe cases arising from excessive interventions can be supplemented. However, what is most crucial lies within the spleen and kidney organs. If diarrhea occurs before dysentery, the spleen contributes to the kidney, leading to malevolent influences, which are hard to treat; if dysentery precedes diarrhea, the kidney transmits minor issues to the spleen, which are easier to heal. Therefore, diseases in the spleen are superficial, while those in the kidney are deep. The kidney is the gate of the stomach, opening to the two yin regions; there has never been a case of prolonged dysentery without harming the kidney. Thus, treating dysentery without supplementing the kidney is not a proper treatment. All the Four Gentlemen (Si Jun Zi), Gui Pi, Shi Quan, and Bu Zhong formulas supplement spleen deficiency and are indeed beneficial. However, if the disease arises from diminished fire and the earth lacks a mother, unless we use cinnamon or aconite to significantly replenish the kidney yang and restore the spleen's maternal role, how can nourishment be received, how can the pathways be secured, and how can true essence be restored?

Liu Hejian and Li Dongyuan first disputed this. Liu claimed that all forms of dysentery arise from heat, associating red with the heart's fire, yellow with the spleen's earth, white with the lung's metal, green with the liver's wood, and black as the extreme of heat, also converging with the kidney's water transformation. All forms of diarrhea are intertwined with warmth, and dampness leads to a sensation of fullness, causing qi to be unable to circulate freely. Excessive damp heat within the intestines and stomach results in a dryness of these organs, leading to frequent urges to defecate along with a feeling of heaviness, and red, painful urination. He indicated that to treat all types of dysentery, bitter cold medicines should be used, possibly with a slight addition of a warming element. Bitterness can dry dampness, while cold can suppress heat, allowing for the smooth circulation of qi. If blood flows properly, rectal bleeding will self-heal; regulating qi will alleviate feelings of heaviness. Li's approach, starting from spleen and stomach conditions, stated that upward disturbances in the lungs present as white, while downward transmissions to the yin manifest as red. The \"Treasured Mirror of Health\" asserts that the Taiyin governs diarrhea, which presents in the Shaoyin as dysentery. This occurs as a result of the loss of bodily fluids and subsequent heat leading to dryness. The kidneys dislike dryness, residing in the lower abdominal blood division, thus leading to pus and blood in the stool for those affected. Nevertheless, red and yellow indicate heat, while green and white signify cold. Danxi said that dysentery from stagnation is due to the heat pressing down, causing the sensation of fullness and heaviness. Therefore, one should use Liu's methods for treating damp heat and Li's for preserving the spleen’s earth, further assessing the balance of qi and blood to determine the appropriate treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-82p","marker":"82p","type":"translation","text":"The three schools all express what previous generations have not, and they highlight the essentials. I have often studied this. From the perspective that the five colors correspond to the five organs, one can see that within the dampness and heat, five evils are intertwined. From the viewpoint of the rising and descending flow of qi and blood, one can observe that the qi and blood of the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians can all be harmed, resulting in both red and white dysentery. From the perspective of dampness and heat as a disease, it is clear that the causes of dampness and heat are not singular. From the differentiation of dysentery into deficiency and excess, one can see that all symptoms among patients with dysentery, such as restlessness, dry throat, black tongue, belching, heaviness in the back, abdominal pain, bloating, as well as foot pain, swelling, and weakness, have distinctions between deficiency and excess. Therefore, I conclude that dysentery arises from evil entering the stomach to create dampness and heat; when qi is harmed, it causes illness in the lungs; when blood is harmed, it is transmitted to the heart. The heart and lungs are the masters of blood and qi. Once the pathways of blood and qi are affected, how can they not return to the organs they govern? The large and small intestines are related to the heart and lungs, being the officials in charge of the intake and distribution of food and fluids. The stomach is the chief of the large and small intestines, and it is also the sea that contains the qi of the five organs and six bowels as well as the twelve meridians. If there are external and internal evils that harm the organs and meridians, or if the evil moves to the stomach, which belongs to the transformation of damp earth, then when the stomach suffers from the evil, the dampness cannot be transformed, accumulating and resulting in damp heat."},{"anchor":"trans-83p","marker":"83p","type":"translation","text":"When diseases of the heart and lungs transfer to the intestines, if only the large intestine suffers, the qi becomes concentrated and forms white dysentery; if only the small intestine suffers, the blood becomes concentrated and forms red dysentery; if both the large and small intestines are affected, red and white mix and are expelled together. The damp heat of the stomach that corrupts the large and small intestines also follows this pattern, with a yellow color. If the color is black, there are two types: one is a scorched black, which is black caused by extreme heat combined with water transformation; the other is a glossy black like lacquer, which represents stagnant blood. Some say: Treating dysentery begins in the intestines and stomach, which is the commonly held practice; now, if we seek the initial pathogens and the channels they entered, what is the use? It is said: The disease in the intestines and stomach is the manifestation. The pathogens encountered and the channels first affected are the root cause. Furthermore, the Inner Canon indicates that for treating root and branch, there are appropriate methods for each, and the order of application matters. Additionally, the methods for transferring and changing conditions are not different from those for treating febrile diseases; how can one not pursue this? Is it just this? As for diseases arising from the intestines and stomach, they should also be analyzed based on the balance of pathogenic and righteous qi. Either the righteous qi is initially deficient, allowing the invasion of pathogens, or it becomes deficient due to the pathogens; thus, the former is the root cause, and the latter is the manifestation, akin to the distinction between old and new accumulations. Old accumulations are formed from retained food and phlegm, while new accumulations arise after the old are eliminated and result from stagnation of qi and blood. Old accumulations should be treated first through elimination, while new accumulations should not be purged."},{"anchor":"trans-84p","marker":"84p","type":"translation","text":"What is the reason for this? It is because the digestion of water and grains in the intestines and stomach, along with the transportation of waste, all depend on the function of the spleen and stomach. Now, if there is an evil presence in the intestines and stomach, the spleen and stomach cannot operate freely, leading to obstruction, and so the defensive qi becomes stagnant and cannot circulate, while the nourishing blood weeps and cannot move. Consequently, phlegm accumulates in the stomach, waste remains in the intestines, and together with the stagnant qi and weeping blood, this results in a blockage that causes illness. In such cases, one must expel the blockage to ensure the smooth functioning of the spleen and stomach. If the ascending and descending processes still do not function, the defensive qi becomes stagnant again, and the nourishing blood weeps again, creating new accumulation, thus the illness returns. In this situation, it is unnecessary to seek out the evil to treat it; rather, one should regulate the defensive qi to open the pores, harmonize the nourishing blood to adjust the balance of yin and yang. When yin and yang are balanced and the pores are open, the pathways of ascending and descending will function, and the accumulation will dissipate on its own. However, there are certain accumulations that must not be purged. Initially, due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, they cannot transform and transport the food accumulations, so one must first replenish the spleen and stomach, ensuring that the true qi within them is full, and then one can purge it, so as to avoid any errors. I have often encountered popular methods that adhere to a limited number of prescriptions for treating dysentery, mainly relying on purging. But how can one know that the medicines used to attack the illness are all those that drain qi and damage blood? If used continuously, they can even lead to the scattering of qi and loss of blood, leaving the five zang organs empty, and the essence depleted, resulting in the spirit departing and death.

One should avoid the use of toxic substances such as arsenic, vermillion, Ba, and Nao, as their aggressive poison may harm the pure qi of the intestines and stomach. Furthermore, it is said that “in the prescriptions, hot medicines are primarily used, while cold medicines are supplementary.\" This may be acceptable for treating clear dysentery, but when there are urgent symptoms with heaviness after defecation, these conditions are all related to heat.

However, if there is abdominal pain without thirst, a preference for warm drinks, clear and frequent urination, no fever in the body, and a preference for warm compresses on the abdomen, this indicates a cold-related dysentery and should be treated with warming herbs like ginger and cinnamon. As for the initial onset of illness, it is generally due to heat dysentery. If it lingers for a long time with persistent symptoms or even worsening conditions, it should be treated differently; in this case, one should not just observe but should use tonifying treatments to replenish the Middle and boost Qi.

After dysentery, excessive discharge may lead to blood loss, with energy dispersing alongside the dysentery. This results in both yin and yang being deficient; yang deficiency leads to aversion to cold, whereas yin deficiency leads to aversion to heat, causing a conflict between cold and heat, resembling malaria but not truly malaria.

However, when discussing diarrhea, it aligns with the main symptoms of the Jueyin channel in \"Treatise on Cold Damage,\" and this does not match with the vomiting and sudden diarrhea of the two Yangming categories. In their discourse, both Jue and diarrhea are frequently mentioned together. It is first stated that if the qi of the six fu organs is exhausted externally, the hands and feet are cold; if the qi of the five zang organs is exhausted internally, diarrhea cannot be controlled. Thus, the dual presence of Jue and diarrhea signifies extreme deficiency and coldness. For those who can still eat, they die, but those who develop a fever often do not. Why is there such a contradiction?

The \"Neijing\" states that in winter, cold leads to illness and fever, while in summer and autumn, the three heat energies of summer heat and humidity intermingle and produce heat that is much stronger than in winter. When externally induced heat from the three energies leads to diarrhea, it must be expelled from the outside. Therefore, diarrhea must first be resolved by sweating to treat the exterior and then regulate the interior. Firstly, use warming herbs to resolve the exterior, and secondly, use bitter cold herbs to clear the interior; one or two doses may cure. If there is neglect in treating the exterior, the external pathogens will escape through the interior, leading to a situation where one does not recover and cannot stop suffering.

Suddenly, if the pulse changes to a reeling quality, this indicates the emergence of yang energy; without using reversal techniques, how could this occur? Prolonged diarrhea allows the evil to invade the yin, and the body will not be hot; if there is any deficiency heat, it will lead to a persistent fever. Now, due to the method of reversal, we force a temporary surge of disturbances, and soon the evil is expelled from the surface, causing the heat to dissipate.

This condition is tenfold more severe than ingesting purgative poison or lead. The method of forcefully countering this is both misguided and far-fetched! One should adhere to the principles outlined in the \"Inner Canon,\" using such remedies as rhubarb, coptis, and licorice, taking them three to five doses over a day and night, waiting for the downward force of diarrhea and the thirst to ease before beginning to balance internally. There is no need to resort to external measures since the hostility, like water breaking against stone, will naturally exit. Furthermore, there is the emergency method of rapidly opening the \"river\" of the body. The heat and toxins inside rush towards the large intestine and may become obstructed in the bladder. If the bladder is hot and stagnant, the transformation of qi is impaired, leading to short, painful urination. Hence, it is more appropriate to facilitate this flow rather than forcibly countering the condition. Clearing the bladder allows for qi to flow and dissipate the heat swiftly. Zhongjing stated: \"When there is a downward flow of qi, one should promote urination.\" Qi is the essence transformed by the bladder; if it is instead being expelled from the large intestine, then facilitating urination is indeed necessary. However, when water flows from a high source and the lungs are not hot, urination will occur naturally. The lungs and large intestine are interconnected; the heat of the large intestine arises from the heat of the lungs.

Zhongjing selected it for its principle of unblocking through the means of unblocking use. Qilei Le has both unblocking and obstructing effects; it clears phlegm, digests stagnant food, resolves qi stagnation, while also firming up the intestines to prevent collapse. Zhongjing chose it for its mutual application of unblocking and obstructing as well.

I write these humble thoughts as a contribution for later generations to delve deeper into this subject. Regarding the treatment of malaria, one should progress from the lesser yang and retreat in between. Advancing towards the yang should indeed start with the lesser yang as a guiding principle. Likewise, for dysentery, one should also refer to the lesser yang, since the qi from food and drink enters the stomach and moves rapidly downward; initially, the energy of the lesser yang is not able to expand, and subsequently, it becomes trapped. Thus, rather than broadly seeking the three yang, it is better to specifically seek the lesser yang, allowing the clear energy from the heavens to elevate and the flavors of the water and earth to transform naturally, with subtle and proper dispersal, avoiding the suffering of urgent dysentery. Moreover, since the bodily fluids stored in the two yangming channels have already been excreted, one should not further induce sweating. The \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" clearly states the prohibition on sweating when in the presence of yangming excess, and the \"Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet\" reinforces the ban on inducing sweating in cases of diarrhea, stating that one should not attack the exterior when there is clear diarrhea from food intake, as sweating will inevitably lead to fullness and distension."},{"anchor":"trans-99p","marker":"99p","type":"translation","text":"Excessive loss of bodily fluids harms the essence; sweating further depletes these fluids.

Therefore, one should adhere to the method of the lesser yang, gently reversing the descending clear energy, allowing the body to follow the natural orders of spring and summer without causing repression. In essence, this is a harmonizing method, entirely distinct from the intention of inducing sweat. If the bodily fluids are not harmed, sweating does not pose a problem; but if the fluids are harmed, any slight moisture between the skin is already indicative of rising problematic energy. Can the exterior invasion of wind and cold in the greater yang simply be treated with sweating? Can the combined conditions of the greater yang and yangming presenting with diarrhea be treated like that with kudzu root? Alas! How subtle this is! For treating dysentery, use the method that is open and prevalent, alongside the gold needle technique. The pathogenic fire, dampness, and heat press forth and should only be remedied with bitter and cold herbs, such as those found in the major and minor purge formulas.

However, when there is stagnant heat, one should alternate between ascending and descending methods, and cannot rely solely on one approach. Using spices like clove and sand cardamom with fire to aid fire can lead to harm. In cases where diarrhea occurs prior to dysentery, it is an indication of reversal.

A taut and rapid pulse indicates reversal and is a sign of imminent death. Postpartum dysentery also requires warming and tonification. For cases with blood in the stool, cooling and activating the blood is necessary, using herbs like Angelica, Huangqin, and peach kernel.

Contemporary beliefs largely align with this notion that dysentery arises from summer heat, making it understandable that it involves heat. However, heat is a natural phenomenon of heaven. If there is a day when it is not hot, it inevitably leads to disaster. It is common for individuals to desire coolness due to the heat. Overindulging in raw and cold foods is what brings about dysentery. Many who are cautious of illness, despite exposure to intense heat, do not suffer from cold and coolness, hence they experience no dysentery. Is it not that they uniquely do not succumb to heat? The illness actually stems from the cold evil rather than the summer heat; it lies in human actions, rather than the weather. This can be deduced clearly. However, those with strong stomachs and solid vitality can consume fruits and similar items daily and remain healthy, thus avoiding illness. Those slightly weaker may not be ill immediately, but over time, when the intense heat shifts westward and the newly cool air arrives, the lurking internal yin becomes active, seizing the opportunity to strike. Thus, cold dampness tends to invade the spleen particularly in the months of July and August, marking the transition from yang declining to yin rising, which is easy to observe.

For mild cases, promote movement; for more severe cases, use purgatives. In distinguishing deficiency conditions, look for weakened body structure, pale or bluish complexion, pulse that is rapid yet weak and lacking vitality, pulse that appears firm yet is actually weak, patients with inherent Yang deficiency, those prone to coldness or subtle indigestion, encountering cold or damp weather, or cases of improper diet, particularly in individuals with weaker spleens due to age.

Regardless of whether one is thin or fat, all have this fat; the fat is thicker in the fat person and thinner in the thin person, and there is no one without fat. If there were truly no fat, how would the space between the intestines permit anything to be thin and exposed? Not only would this lack of support be insecure, but the organs would also be easily harmed—this is illogical. In the case of those suffering from diarrhea, it is merely the fat of the five internal organs that is not secure, causing it to be stripped away daily. If the strength of the organ's energy is slightly robust, it can go and come as it pleases, and there is little to worry about. If the organ's energy deteriorates, being stripped away completely, or if one suffers from prolonged diarrhea, only observing blood and watery discharge, the average person may claim that there is no longer lingering accumulation and even deem it good, not knowing that if the fat is scraped away completely, it signifies an extreme dangerous condition.

For minor cases, it is advisable to eliminate the stagnation, while for severe cases, purging and expelling it is suitable.

Abdominal pain from deficiency cold is particularly important to distinguish. Generally, pain from diarrhea is mostly due to cold qi in the organs. The classics say: pain is often due to an excess of cold qi. Thus, pain occurs because of cold. It also states: illness causing pain is associated with yin. Therefore, if a person overeats raw or cold foods, or is exposed to cold air, they may experience abdominal pain; this is well understood. If cold is present internally, the treatment should warm the spleen; if cold is in the lower regions, the treatment should warm the kidneys. Furthermore, the principle of deficiency cold causing pain is often not well known. If the original qi is insufficient internally, even without external cold pathogens, if the internal qi is not warmed, this is a cold syndrome.

How can pain be said to always stem from accumulation and to always indicate solid proof in such cases? In treating pain caused by deficiency and cold, it is essential to promptly warm and nourish the internal qi, without further depleting it, which would lead to a nurturing pain becoming worse, and smooth maladies becoming more pronounced, posing a significant risk.

I've seen a physician state that dysentery must last seven days before tonics can be used, ignorant that the patient may die within six days. This stubbornness is exceedingly foolish. However, for those with intense pain, it is advisable to slightly add an aromatic herb, such as patchouli, to the nourishing concoction to harmonize the qi, or to increase angelica to regulate blood; once the pain alleviates, these two ingredients should be removed. This caution stems from the fear of patchouli depleting qi and angelica causing excessive intestinal relaxation. If the cold is in the lower burner inducing pain, then the addition of evodia is necessary. If the pain is not severe, then the primary approach should center on warming and tonifying the spleen and kidneys; as the condition stabilizes, the pain should naturally subside without needing specific treatment for the pain."},{"anchor":"trans-112p","marker":"112p","type":"translation","text":"When there is urgency and heaviness in the lower abdomen, the illness resides at the lowest part of the large intestine, but its root cause is not in the large intestine; it lies in the spleen and kidneys. Various forms of dysentery, whether hot, cold, or arising from deficiency, are present and cannot all be classified as heat. If there is heat in the middle burner, it compels heat pathogens downwards; if there is cold in the middle burner, it compels cold pathogens downwards; if there is deficiency of spleen and kidney qi, it causes qi to descend and press downwards. To treat this, one must first understand the cause and then address the root of the spleen and kidneys, and there will be no case that does not heal. However, if the illness is in the large intestine, it is no longer simply a case of food accumulation. When food accumulation reaches this point, it would not leave any residue upon diarrhea; what remains is merely the descending qi, which is formless. Thus, even if there seems to be an urge to expel, in reality, there is nothing to expel. When there is nothing to expel yet it appears there is an urge, it is purely the effect of qi. Hence, the use of Shao Yao Decoction by Hejian, which claims that moving the blood leads to self-healing and adjusting the qi alleviates heaviness at the back, is indeed logical. However, adjusting the qi must be done appropriately: for heat in the qi, cool it; for cold in the qi, warm it; for deficiency in the qi, tonify it; for descending qi, uplift it; it is essential to harmonize the qi, only then can it be regulated. The method of moving blood is similar. If one merely uses ingredients like Mu Xiang, Bing Lang, Dang Gui, and Da Huang to dispel qi and move blood, as a means of harmonization without realizing that the large intestine is the farthest point, thus making it difficult for the medicine to reach it, what actually disperses and moves is merely the qi of the middle burner. Moreover, if the qi has already descended, further dispersing and moving it will only cause it to descend further; will there be any possibility of healing? Moreover, dysentery must stop before heaviness can stop, and there has never been a case where dysentery does not heal and yet heaviness can heal. Therefore, anyone wishing to treat this should focus on treating the dysentery as the main priority."},{"anchor":"trans-113p","marker":"113p","type":"translation","text":"**On Pain from the Large Intestine** In cases of dysentery, there are often pains from the large intestine. What is the reason for this? It is because the spleen and stomach are out of harmony; thus, the vital essence of food and drink fails to transform properly, leading to oppressive and foul substances being expelled through the orifices, resulting in unavoidable pain. Furthermore, if fire causes diarrhea and yang is driven away by yin, then the yang energy in the stomach becomes forced downward, unable to disperse, which gives rise to swelling. Therefore, where dysentery is more severe, pain is also greater; where dysentery is less severe, pain is also less. Pain and absence of pain are determined by whether the energy is trapped or not. Consequently, regardless of whether it is cold dysentery or hot dysentery, pain can arise from the large intestine and cannot be solely attributed to heat. To treat this, one need only address the dysentery; when the dysentery ceases, the swelling and pain will naturally resolve, akin to the principle of heaviness after defecation. As Danxi stated: pain from the large intestine arises when heat flows downward, and the main remedies are musk, areca nut, scutellaria, and coptis combined with fried ginger. This shows that it is known that fire can cause swelling and pain, but how does one comprehend the sinking of original yang? Subsequent generations have all followed this method. As for those with deficiency and cold, many cannot endure this condition."},{"anchor":"trans-114p","marker":"114p","type":"translation","text":"### Discussion on Thirst All cases of dysentery must involve significant thirst. Nowadays, people only see thirst and immediately attribute it to heat, not realizing that both those with heat and those without can experience thirst. It is crucial to distinguish between the two. When heat is strong within, it scorches the spleen and burns the stomach, depleting fluids and causing a strong craving for cold water, which they consume excessively to the point of never growing tired of it; the cooler it is, the more they desire it. This indicates thirst due to heat, which requires treatment with cooling methods. However, if the mouth is hot and thirsty, but one cannot drink much water despite wanting to, this is not true heat and should not be treated with cooling methods. Generally, if the mouth is dry and thirsty preferring coolness, but the stomach does not tolerate coolness, this indicates cold accumulating within, while superficial heat lingers above. Such cases strongly contraindicate cold remedies. Thirst can be genuine or deceptive. A true thirst must prefer tea; just by observing the preference for hot or cold, one can discern the nature of the heat or cold."},{"anchor":"trans-115p","marker":"115p","type":"translation","text":"Like someone who is thirsty, they may feel dry, but it does not mean they are truly thirsty. If the mouth is dry yet there is no desire to drink, it indicates that it is certainly not a heat syndrome. However, in cases of diarrhea, because the fluids leak downwards, there will inevitably be a depletion of fluids upwards, hence the feeling of thirst cannot be avoided. Thirst accompanied by a desire to drink is due to insufficient internal fluids, seeking external fluids for assistance; it does not necessarily indicate the presence of heat. Therefore, one must carefully assess whether there is heat or not. If there is an excess of heat, one should clear the heat; if there is a deficiency of water, one should nourish the yin. Moreover, qi is the mother of water; if there is qi deficiency that cannot generate water, without nourishing the mother, water cannot be produced and thirst remains unrelieved. The spleen governs water; if there is spleen deficiency that cannot control water, without strengthening the main organ, water cannot be stored and thirst persists. If one can treat the cause of thirst rather than just addressing the thirst itself, what need is there for a thirst condition?"},{"anchor":"trans-116p","marker":"116p","type":"translation","text":"**On Small Urine** In all cases of dysentery, small urine will often be abundant and not beneficial; there may be much yellow or red. This is significantly related to the conditions of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess, and must not be overlooked. If there is sudden diarrhea, due to the unclear distinction between clean and turbid, food and fluids both enter the large intestine, hence the water may not be beneficial; this is only temporary. However, in dysentery accompanied by small urine, the underlying illness is not uniform. Nowadays, people merely see yellow or red and conclude it is heat, which leads to many misunderstandings. In cases due to heat, the heat must be very intense and may involve considerable pain or fresh blood; only then should there be signs of heat both above and below. This indicates true heat, which should be treated with cooling methods. If it is not true heat, it may arise from internal cold constraining the yang in the lower region, or from the loss of yin due to diarrhea causing water to be depleted and the color to change, or from the lower yang's failure to warm and transform water, or from improper use of astringent methods that deplete fluids. However, if there is no fire in the three warmers, then despite the yellow or turbid appearance, it suggests a lack of yin and fluids, and can't simply be analyzed as heat. It is imperative to nourish and support true yin as it is the best approach. The \"Inner Canon\" states: \"When the middle qi is insufficient, urine and stools will change.\" How profound are these words! Why do people nowadays fail to recognize this? Additionally, whenever small urine is clear and accompanied by abdominal pain, they still apply herbs like Qin and Lian, but do not understand what this implies."},{"anchor":"trans-117p","marker":"117p","type":"translation","text":"**On the Doubts and Similarities of Yin and Yang** The principle of Yin and Yang is the foundation of nurturing life and treating diseases, yet it is not easily understood by people due to its unpredictable nature. The function of Yin and Yang seeks mutual support, not mutual harm. Mutual support means harmony; there cannot be Yin without Yang, nor Yang withoutYin. Mutual harm causes damage. When Yang harms Yin, it results in withering; when Yin harms Yang, it brings about extinction. All diseases are due to the mutual harm of Yin and Yang, resulting in a loss of harmony. The nature of Yin and Yang is such that Yin prefers stillness and hates motion, while Yang enjoys warmth and fears cold. When they harm each other, Yin fears the excess of Yang, leading to either withering or desiccation; Yang fears the toxins of Yin, leading to either fleeing or flying away in the presence of Yin's invasion, which embodies the jealousy of Yin and Yang. In cases of severe illness that exhibit doubt between false and true, this reflects the evidence. This is particularly evident in cases of typhus and dysentery. Nowadays, those suffering from dysentery often exhibit signs of heat in both the upper and lower parts of the body, which does not always indicate true heat. How can this be observed? For instance, agitation can seem like heat but is not true heat; restlessness can appear mad yet is not madness, leading to a state too vague to describe. This does not represent true Yang evidence. This agitation is the result of damaged essence and blood, with the fire not having water to cool it, leading to the depletion of Yin's stillness. Additionally, symptoms where one feels hot above or has pain below, such as thirst and sore throats or redness and heat in the body, may not correspond to true heat."},{"anchor":"trans-118p","marker":"118p","type":"translation","text":"Water and fire mutually constrain each other; the yang drives away the yin. When fire departs from its proper position, it causes erratic movements. Nowadays, people only observe these symptoms and say that one must look to the physical manifestations of the illness. If the heat from physical symptoms is evident, they still claim it is cold. This reflects an awareness of external heat without recognizing the internal cold, similar to being aware of heat above and not knowing the cold in the middle. Furthermore, how can they understand that restlessness indicates yin deficiency and erratic movements signify yang deficiency? Even within uncertainty, one must still discern clearly. For instance, when the exterior muscles exhibit heat symptoms, one ought to feel aversion to heat, yet they refuse to part from their clothing or coverings. Some may even prefer warmth on their abdomen, indicating the need for warmth or pressure; despite feeling hot externally, there may still be cold internally."},{"anchor":"trans-119p","marker":"119p","type":"translation","text":"In addition, when there is heat evidence in all nine orifices, there is a strong desire for cold drinks.

Even if the mouth and tongue have sores and pain, there is still a desire for hot soup and drinks. This indicates that although there is heat above and below, there is cold in the middle burner. Additionally, there are cases of weak yang energy and a faint pulse, as previously discussed. If one only recognizes this as fire and treats it with cold, while the underlying issue is internal cold, adding more cold will only invade the stomach and directly affect the middle burner. The external heat does not relate to this, and the internal cold will become even more severe. Consequently, those who are already ill will become more ill, akin to adding frost on snow. The desire to preserve the solitary yang cannot be achieved. Therefore, in treating such conditions, one should only be able to draw the fire back to its source, warming the elixir field; thus, the fire will then dry out. By solidifying the lower source, energy returns to essence. This is the mysterious principle of the reversal of yin and yang."},{"anchor":"trans-120p","marker":"120p","type":"translation","text":"### On Treating In general, the principles for treating dysentery involve understanding the conditions of deficiency and excess, cold and heat; grasping these essentials leads to success, while losing sight of them results in the greatest harm. The methods for regulating diarrhea should be carefully applied. When initially hurt by cold and when dietary irregularities occur, if the stomach qi remains intact and the original qi is not depleted, symptoms such as intense pain, bloating, violent diarrhea, or dysentery might arise, especially if there is food stagnation that hasn't cleared. In such cases, a dose of Five Virtues Pills, or formulas like Ping Wei San, Wei Ling Tang, and Wu Ling San should be used to mildly dispel cold stagnation; recovery is very attainable. For those with weak spleen and kidneys who suffer from cold, dysentery can easily occur, regardless of whether they are adults or children. For cases of spleen deficiency leading to dysentery, without the presence of excess heat or other symptoms, it is advisable to first warm the spleen using Guan Jian. If the illness has progressed to involve the liver and kidneys, then Wei Guan Jian is most effective; do not fear using it due to its newness. Alternatively, other formulations like Five Virtues Pills and Four Spirits Pills can also be utilized. In severe cases of both spleen and kidney deficiency, use Wei Guan Jian as the first choice, followed by Wen Wei Yin, or use both alternately as needed. One may also combine it with formulas like Si Wei San, Jiu Qi Dan, or Fu Yang Dan. For dysentery accompanied by vomiting and a strong urge to vomit, or if there is a feeling of nausea upon smelling food, this indicates that cold has weakened the stomach qi, making it unable to tolerate. It is essential to warm and nourish the stomach. Use prescriptions like Wu Jun Zi Jian, Liu Wei Yi Gong Jian, Wen Wei Yin, and Sheng Zhu San for this condition. If vomiting is severe, then Liu Wei Hui Yang Yin should be the primary treatment. If there is a deficiency of fire in the yin, causing nausea due to qi not returning to the original source, then Wei Guan Jian and Li Yin Jian should be used as the main treatments."},{"anchor":"trans-121p","marker":"121p","type":"translation","text":"If gastrointestinal fire rises and causes vomiting, there will necessarily be symptoms of heat and fullness, and cooling and fire-reducing herbs can be used, such as large doses of Qingyin Decoction and Yiyuan Powder. In cases of exuberant damp-heat, with vexation and a preference for coolness, a firm pulse and abdominal fullness, or pure bright red diarrhea, it is advisable to use Qingliang Decoction or Huangqin and Shaoyao Decoction, or Xianglian Pill, or Hejian Shaoyao Decoction. If the heat is severe, large doses of Qingyin Decoction or Yincheng Decoction should be given. If these remedies do not yield results after several doses, one must consider nourishing the spleen and kidneys. For dysentery accompanied by fever, it seems to belong to fire and should be treated with cooling methods. However, signs of true heat may not necessarily present with fever; instead, dysentery can harm vital essence and blood, leading to yin deficiency and water loss, resulting in heat and agitation. If there is latent fire in a weak condition, and the pulse feels strong, it is advisable to add or reduce Yin Decoction or Baoyin Decoction. If the pulse is fundamentally weak and there is purely virtual fire, fire should not be treated; one should focus on strengthening water and supplementing yin, using San Yin Decoction or Liuwei or Bawuwei Pills. If yin is strong and counteracting yang causes external heat, it is necessary to use Weiguan Decoction and Yougui Decoction. When dysentery first occurs, if the vital Qi is still strong, or if it is due to overeating, leading to stagnation of food and drink, with symptoms of firm, painful fullness and both Qi and pulse being firm, one can first eliminate the accumulation, which will stop the dysentery itself. Qingqi Decoction, Shenyoupill, or Baishun Pill should be prescribed. Alternatively, using Chi Jin Dou for mild purgation can be effective, as pain diminishes with the alleviation of constipation.

Therefore, great caution is necessary. Locking the mouth and not eating is the most dangerous symptom of diarrhea, yet it has not been clearly distinguished since ancient times. Observing what Danxi said: \"Locking the mouth in diarrhea is due to excessive heat in the stomach.\" One should take a decoction of huanglian (Coptis), and ginseng, sipping it throughout the day. If one vomits and then eats again, just a sip, swallowing it would be good. People are unaware of this and instead use warming and sweet medicines, akin to fire aiding fire, therefore worsening stagnation. There are also instances where one mistakenly takes a hot and toxic medicine that offends the stomach, which should be clarified and the poison expelled. This is what Danxi referred to. The distinction of locking the mouth is very subtle; is it merely due to excessive heat in the stomach that one believes huanglian can treat it all? Locking the mouth occurs because food cannot enter. Although there may be evidence of excess heat, deficiency and cold of the spleen and stomach are more common. If one locks the mouth due to food stagnation in the stomach, there will certainly be distention in the chest and abdomen, or one may experience pain. In such cases, one should resolve the stagnation and eliminate the accumulation, so when the accumulation is removed, food can enter again. This can be achieved with herbs such as Qing, Chen, Zha, and Pu. If one locks the mouth due to constrained heat in the stomach, the internal organs must be quite heated, with a pulse that is rapid and strong. In this case, one should drain fire and eliminate the heat evil, allowing food to enter again, using herbs like Qin, Lian, Zhi, and Bo. In all these instances, it is the evil that accumulates within that causes the actual symptom of locking the mouth."},{"anchor":"trans-123p","marker":"123p","type":"translation","text":"However, the actual evidence is scarce; yet among those suffering from illness, when one examines their appetite, many show no signs of distension or fullness. Or upon examining the presence of heat evils, they are also found to lack true heat, only manifesting symptoms of excess outflow without inflow, leading to a daily decline in stomach energy and spirit. Since there is no distension, it is not due to accumulation; and since there is no true heat, it is not due to fire. Without accumulation and without fire, yet food cannot enter—what is the reason? It is due to the organ's inability to receive. The inability to receive arises from two causes: one is the weakness of the spleen's energy, which may result in vomiting, nausea, or aversion to food odors, leading to discomfort; or a feeling of hunger without the ability to eat, leaving the stomach empty and awaiting distress. This is because the middle burner is not functioning, thus preventing food from entering, and the responsibility lies with the spleen."},{"anchor":"trans-124p","marker":"124p","type":"translation","text":"The weakness of the kidney qi causes the gate of life to be unable to warm, leading to the large intestine's inability to consolidate and the small intestine's failure to transform, thus hindering the stomach qi's movement.

To strengthen the middle jiao, one must use herbs such as ginseng, white astragalus, dried ginger, and licorice. To bolster the lower jiao, one must use substances like cooked rehmannia, aconite, wuzhuyu (Evodia), and cinnamon. When the spleen and kidneys are strong, food naturally enters, and the principle is clear as it resonates like an echo. My experience in this matter cannot be overstated. Danxi's use of huanglian (coptis) and the notion of using fire to assist fire, and stagnation to increase stagnation is primarily focused on the concept of true fire, showing merely a one-sided perspective. This constrains human intelligence and life force; their interrelationship is significant and should not be treated lightly. In cases of prolonged diarrhea with yang deficiency, or when excessive cold attacks lead to the depletion of the spleen and kidney essence, resulting in constant looseness, the original source is already damaged. Even if aggressive warming and tonifying medicines are administered, they will certainly be ineffective.

The brilliance of this recipe lies in using such a large amount of white peony and angelica at two taels, which ensures there is enough liver blood. By not depleting or overcoming the spleen and earth element, there arises an opportunity for the spleen's energy to rejuvenate, naturally allowing the large intestine to facilitate its functions.

The symptoms of dysentery often arise from the heat and humidity of summer, aggravated by atmospheric moisture from rain and dew. The discharge may appear mixed, resembling blood and pus; in severe cases, it can be as bad as leaking roofs or frozen fish, accompanied by urgency, heaviness, and pain, with a strong desire to defecate but inability to do so, or defecation without relief. It may occur dozens or even hundreds of times day and night, leaving one gasping, waiting for death.

Water-dampness most abhors the slippery nature of angelica, whereas dysentery favors it. Peony has a sour taste that enters the liver to pacify wood, so that it dares not invade the spleen-earth again. Additionally, there are bitter orange and betel nut to dispel damp-heat, along with plantain seeds to promote the flow of dampness without depleting true kidney yin, thus this formula is even more effective than poria. Particularly remarkable is the inclusion of radish seeds, a point often overlooked by many. Radish seeds have a spicy flavor that can dispel evils and eliminate dampness, and they also promote communication both upwards and downwards. They aid digestion and facilitate qi movement within the blood, assisting angelica and peony to generate new blood and eliminate stagnation.

To remedy this, use white peony and Ligusticum to nourish the liver and subdue the wood.

While passing through the palace, he happened to see a small pharmacy and sent a messenger to inquire, \"Can you treat dysentery?\" The response was: \"It is my specialty.\" The messenger then brought him in to ask about the cause of the illness, and it was mentioned that he had eaten too many river crabs, leading to this ailment. He was then asked to check the pulse and diagnosed it as a type of cold dysentery. The prescribed method involved using freshly harvested lotus root segments, finely ground, to be taken with hot wine.

I remembered a formula passed down from my ancestors, which involved using a turtle from a pond. Following the method, I prepared it mainly with fresh ginger and a small piece of rock sugar, avoiding salt and sauces. After cooking it thoroughly, he consumed one or two bowls. Within three days, he did not need to go to the toilet, and from then on, his large intestine was functional, and the rectum returned to normal. This condition was likely due to a deficiency in the spleen, leading to a lack of nourishment for both the lungs and the large intestine. Thus, the large intestine was unable to function properly. The turtle, categorized as a shellfish and having an element of earth, is warm and can nourish the spleen and lungs. Moreover, the lungs, having been exposed to cold due to previous treatments involving bitter and cold herbs, now required warming. Therefore, ginger, which is spicy, was used to restore the lung's metal element, and the sweetness of rock sugar was employed to fortify the spleen's earth element. Once the lung energy was sufficient, the large intestine also became robust, allowing it to regain its function.

I prescribed a restorative formula to boost the central qi, adding ginger and cinnamon. After one dose, the dysentery improved significantly; after a second dose, however, the malaria symptoms intensified alarmingly. The host was frightened, but I reassured them: This is a good sign. The prior cessation of malaria indicated an extreme dominance of yin, causing yang to refrain from confrontation.
