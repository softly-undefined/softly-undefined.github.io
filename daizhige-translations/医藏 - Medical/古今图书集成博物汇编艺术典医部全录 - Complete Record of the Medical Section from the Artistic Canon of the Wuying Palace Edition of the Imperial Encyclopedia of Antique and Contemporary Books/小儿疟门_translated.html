<p><strong>Childhood Malaria</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complete Book of Pediatrics</strong> [Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p><strong>Malaria</strong></p>
<p>There are two methods for treating malaria: for acute malaria, one should first stop the attack and then replenish; for chronic malaria, one should first replenish and then stop the attack. When treating malaria, it is important to differentiate between morning and evening treatments. If the attack occurs before noon, it indicates that the pathogen is present in the yang aspect; one should first use Pingwei Powder with added Changshan and Caoguo to treat it, and then follow up with Pingyue Yangpi Pill for nourishment. If the attack occurs in the afternoon, it indicates the pathogen is present in the yin aspect; for mild cases, one may use Siwu Decoction with added Guizhi or Guizhi Decoction with Taoren and Honghua to dispel cold pathogens from the blood; for severe cases, use Xiaochaihu Decoction with added Changshan and Caoguo to stop the attack; if slightly improved, then use Pingyue Yangpi Decoction to adjust. If there is more heat than cold in the attack, one should use Baihu Decoction with added Changshan and Caoguo to stop it; if there is a balance of cold and heat, one should use Chaihu Decoction with added Changshan and Caoguo to stop it, and then follow with Pingyue Yangpi Decoction for adjustment. For adults, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction for adjustment. The above methods all prioritize stopping the attack first before replenishing.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>For chronic malaria that lingers and does not retreat, occurring either every two days or every three days, the illness has deeply entrenched; one must not recklessly use interruptive medicines. Instead, employ the Pingyue Yangpi Pill to adjust it. If there is sweating, one should aim for no sweating; if there is no sweating, one should aim for sweating, as this will facilitate easier resolution of the malaria. Additionally, avoid wind and cold, and refrain from consuming chicken, fish, or cold water. Even the most potent elixirs would be ineffective if these precautions are violated.</p>
<p>When malaria transitions into dysentery, this condition often arises at the end of summer or the beginning of autumn, due to the accumulation of latent Yin within, which is exacerbated by sitting in cold. It must be treated based on deficiency; one should not resort to laxatives without care. If it is a simple case of dysentery, use Xianglian Pill taken with aged rice soup; if it is malaria with dysentery, treat with the Pingyue Yangpi Pill and/or the Tangerine Peel Harmonizing Pill.</p>
<p>If after malaria the face and body swell, this is due to receiving wind after sweating. In this case, use Weiling Pill, combining it with the decoction of Wujia skin and the light, long-flowing water for treatment.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>For external bathing methods, during midday, wipe the body with warm water in a sheltered area from the wind, then rest for a while, covered with a blanket, to induce slight sweating. Following this method daily yields significant effects.</p>
<p>If there is abdominal distension or shortness of breath after a fever, or if there is no breathlessness, this is caused by injury from cold affecting both the spleen and lungs. Distension is associated with the spleen, while breathlessness relates to the lungs. The treatment involves using Taqi Pills to alleviate distension, and Tingli Pills to settle breathing, followed by Jisheng Pills for balancing.</p>
<p>If there is a feeling of fullness in the abdomen after a fever, this is referred to as the &#39;mother of fever.&#39; It can occur from excessive intake of cold water or can develop from excessive heat. The treatment is primarily with Yuebian Pills.</p>
<p>For those who are yellow, thin, and exhibit signs of deficiency heat after a fever, Jisheng Pills alone can lead to recovery. Ancestral treatments for fever involve cutting off the condition with Zhan Gui Dan and adjusting with Wei Ling Soup. I often use Ping Wei San with added Changsang and Caoguo ground into powder. I recommend taking one coin of this powder, and at the onset of symptoms, boil seven peach tree branches and take it as a decoction in the early morning.</p>
<p>Xijiangyue.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When malaria comes, there are chills and fever, with internal injuries and external influences causing phlegm. At first, the cutting method seems divine, and one must not nurture the tiger to avoid trouble. For external influences, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. For internal injuries, regulating the stomach is the priority. Add grass fruit and common mountain herbs to the decoction with peach and willow branches to ease the entrance. </p>
<p>After cutting, adjust the spleen and stomach; merely clearing malaria and nurturing the spleen is sufficient. Expel evil and supplement the right to act as a good doctor, not letting down Zhong Yang, Qian Yi. If malaria persists, it may lead to blockages, with a pale face and abdominal swelling consuming muscle. The moon and toad gather as the foundation; this formula is a secret record. </p>
<p>For prolonged malaria in children, sometimes the tide comes in the afternoon. Also, during interstitial or tri-day periods, the cutting method should not be hasty. Just use to nourish the spleen and clear malaria, combining the gathering of the holy herbs for balance. Divine beings cut off demons without leniency, discerning at the early morning five. </p>
<p>Prolonged malaria can lead to severe symptoms, with a scorched spleen and a large belly showing blue veins. The head is dry, the feet thin, reducing the original spirit, with no food intake at all. The face is hollow, fearful, and weak, with limbs lacking strength, making it hard to move. There is no need for futile medical treatment; these are symptoms of near-death. </p>
<p>If malaria and dysentery occur together, one must know the auspicious and dangerous signs. Generally, eat and drink as usual, as complete stomach energy can heal. If there’s a lack of appetite, force the spleen and stomach to hold on. Do not delay with Wei Ling pills, interspersed with herbal medicines to stop the symptoms.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Malaria</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: Malaria occurs when summer heat harms the body, causing heat to accumulate in the skin. By autumn, due to labor and the depletion of blood energy, the pores become weak and external evils take advantage of this, leading to conflict between the residual summer heat and the body&#39;s defenses. When the yang is excessive, heat arises; when the yin is excessive, cold results. This back-and-forth of yin and yang leads to exacerbation or diminishment of both. Consequently, fevers and chills emerge; when yin and yang separate, both symptoms cease. However, if external evils disturb the body&#39;s energy again, the conflict can reoccur.</p>
<p>If a child contracts malaria without direct exposure to summer heat, it is likely due to the wet nurse not avoiding wind and cold while carrying and nursing the child. Wind evils harm the skin, and phlegm accumulates in the organs, creating a disharmony in blood and energy, and leading to conflict between yin and yang. If the vital energy prevails, the evil energy retreats; but if the evil energy is not entirely expelled, malaria will manifest.</p>
<p>Even if the evil energy recedes, the yin and blood remain deficient, allowing the evils to disturb the vital energy. The heat within the organs may not dissipate, leading to lingering heat. When the illness first manifests and chills and fevers clash, heat will invade the organs, causing dryness and thirst. If fluids stagnate and form a habit, it may lead to hardened areas under the ribs after recovery. If drinking is unending and urination is scanty, it may result in complications.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>When cold and heat alternate, and heat invades the five organs, qi accumulates without being released, hence causing distress and fullness. The struggle between cold and heat affects the organ’s qi, resulting in abdominal pain. For those with more cold than heat and without sweating, a decoction of equal parts of Cinnamon Twig and Ephedra is appropriate. If there is an abundance of sweating, use Chai Hu Gui Zhi Decoction. If there is much sweating and thirst, Bai Hu Decoction added with Cinnamon can be used. For frequent red and hot urination accompanied by thirst, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If malaria has not yet dispersed, Gui Ku San can stop it. With little cold and much heat, you can take Clear Spleen Decoction or Nourish Stomach Decoction. For treating cold and weak spleen and stomach, Si Shou Yin can also be taken. The malaria remedy should not use arsenic but can include常山 (common mountain) or 阿魏 (ferula), which can truly dissolve masses and blockages. For excess heat, with sweating and thirst along with abdominal pain, Da Chai Hu Decoction with Kudzu can be helpful. For cold symptoms after malaria, with blockages and masses, use Mu Xiang Pill. For restlessness and thirst, use Wu Ling San. In cases of severe heat, Bai Hu Decoction can be enhanced with cinnamon or ginseng. In the event of seasonal high fever, Chai Hu Shi Gao Decoction can also be taken. For severe headaches, a mixture of scallion white and licorice can be used, as well as Zhi Mu Ma Huang Decoction, which is a remarkable remedy for malaria.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Malaria</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;In summer, one suffers from heat, and in autumn there must be intermittent fevers.&quot; Those with mild afflictions are affected quickly, while those with severe ones are affected later and develop malaria. Malaria is a lingering condition of intermittent fevers. This indicates that in summer, one suffers from the heat and cannot release it, causing the evil Qi to act internally, which results in fever by autumn. </p>
<p>This is largely due to nurses holding babies without protection from wind and cold, and also because of exposure to hot and humid weather, leading to evil Qi lodging in the skin and lingering in the organs. The imbalance between Yin and Yang causes the evil and the right Qi to contend, resulting in alternating chills and fevers. If Yang is dominant, there is heat; if Yin is dominant, there is cold. The sequence of chills followed by heat indicates insufficient Yang; the sequence of heat followed by chills indicates insufficient Yin; more cold and less heat indicates that Yin is winning; more heat and less cold indicates that Yang is winning; equal amounts of cold and heat show that Yin and Yang are contending; alternating chills and fevers indicate a sudden separation of Yin and Yang. Generally, children mostly suffer from illnesses arising from diet, so one must first resolve and guide their digestion, and then adapt the treatment according to the source of their illness; this is the best method.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Malaria</strong></p>
<p>Malaria should be categorized according to the six channels and five organs, as well as the differences caused by phlegm, food, overwork, heat, and miasmas, and the variances of the three Yin. For malaria of the Foot Taiyang, it causes pain in the lower back and heaviness in the head, with chills arising from the back, first cold then hot, with a heat that feels intense and persisting complicating sweating. For malaria of the Foot Shaoyang, it leads to body aches, moderate chills, moderate heat, aversion to seeing people, and a restless mind with profuse sweating. Malaria of the Foot Yangming causes prolonged chills before the onset of heat, followed by sweating when the heat subsides, with a pleasure found in the light of the sun or moon, or in warmth. Malaria of the Foot Taiyin results in a lack of joy, frequent sighing, poor appetite, alternating chills and heat, with sweating leading to the end of the illness, followed by nausea.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The disease of the foot Shaoyin manifests with severe vomiting, accompanied by much cold and heat, where heat predominates over cold, leading to a desire to shut oneself indoors, indicating a difficult recovery. The sores of the foot Jueyin cause waist pain and abdominal distension, with difficulty in urination resembling urinary retention, not actually retention, but frequent urination, filled with anxiety and insufficient energy, with a feeling of unease in the abdomen. This pertains to the six channels of illness. </p>
<p>Lung illness causes a chill in the heart, with intense cold and intermittent heat that brings about fright, as if seeing something alarming. Heart illness causes severe agitation, with a desire for clean water, yet experiencing much cold and little heat. Liver illness causes a pale complexion and deep sighs, resembling a dying person. Spleen illness results in a feeling of cold, abdominal pain, and when hot, causes audible sounds in the intestines, leading to sweating. Kidney illness makes one feel scattered, with twisting pain in the back and waist, difficulty in defecation, cloudy vision, and cold hands and feet. Stomach illness leads to a propensity for hunger, yet an inability to eat, feeling full and distended after consuming food. These pertain to the illnesses of the five organs.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Therapeutic Principles: Malaria</strong></p>
<p>For treating childhood malaria, many methods are the same as those for adults, focusing on inducing sweating for recovery, and thus using ingredients like cinnamon twig, bupleurum, ephedra, ginseng, and poria. Additionally, one should observe the patients&#39; diet and phlegm in accordance with their condition. Generally, this illness arises from dietary irregularities, so guiding digestion should be prioritized.</p>
<p>According to the discussions on malaria in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: both intermittent fever and malaria arise from wind and occur at certain times. Qi Bo said: &quot;If one is harmed by summer heat, malaria will certainly develop in autumn.&quot; This refers to the opening of pores where sweat is produced, encountering wind, or from bathing, causing moisture to linger on the skin. When the protective qi is weak, pathogenic factors can invade, resulting in the onset of the disease with cold shivers, pain in the waist and back, and aching joints. When the cold dissipates, there is heat both internally and externally, accompanied by headaches and thirst. This situation arises from the clash between the yin and yang vital energies, leading to alternation between deficiency and excess. When yin energy is predominant, yang is deficient, resulting in initial cold and shivers, with pain in the waist, back, head, and joints; when yang energy prevails, yin is deficient, leading to initial heat.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>When the body is in the initial stages of an illness, there are no cravings for food and a tendency to vomit, with headaches and back pain, and urination is not smooth. When yin is strong and yang is weak, there is cold internally and externally; when yang is strong and yin is weak, there is heat both internally and externally. Additionally, one may be affected by the six pathogenic influences or internal emotional injuries, leading to the accumulation of phlegm and fluid, causing the pathogenic qi and defensive qi to coexist, thus the illness worsens daily. The defensive qi moves in the daytime with yang and in the nighttime with yin. When it departs with yang, it retreats with yin. If the internal organs become weak, the pathogenic qi penetrates deeply and cannot exit with the defensive qi, thus it manifests intermittently. Wherever the defensive qi goes, the location of the pathogenic qi also manifests. In yang conditions, there is heat, and in yin conditions, there is cold. The classic texts state: excessive yang leads to harm, while extremes eventually reverse. When yin and yang each weaken and the defensive qi separates from the pathogenic qi, the illness abates; but when yin and yang clash, and the defensive qi and pathogenic qi reunite, the illness recurs. Each follows its defensive qi and interacts with the corresponding pathogenic qi. If cold precedes heat, it is termed &quot;cold malaria&quot;; if heat precedes cold, it is termed &quot;warm malaria.&quot; If there is heat without cold, it is termed &quot;damp malaria.&quot; Symptoms include a heavy body, alternating chills and fever, bone and joint pain, abdominal distension, spontaneous sweating, and a tendency to vomit, which are all classified as &quot;damp malaria.&quot;<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The cold without heat is called &quot;female malaria.&quot; The nature of malaria as a disease is varied, which is why prescriptions are tailored according to its yin and yang, deficiency and excess, pulse and symptoms. Treatments should be adjusted for sweating, vomiting, purging, or warming, aiming for balance. Among various illnesses, it is important to recognize that due to the deficiency of righteous qi, one can be susceptible to evil qi, which lingers and does not disperse; this leads to a substantive illness. The methods for treating malaria have remained unchanged through the ages—first induce sweating followed by purging. Therefore, the treatment for malaria must begin from the exterior using &quot;Bai Jie San,&quot; and decoction of ginger and scallions; then follow with Xiao Chai Hu Tang mixed with cinnamon and a ginger and jujube decoction to harmonize and resolve the exterior and interior evils, which is naturally effective. If both the exterior and interior are substantial, use Dang Gui San, Wu He Tang, or Wu Xi Wan, Liusheng Wan for purging, harmonizing qi to stop supplementation, and finally use Huo Xiang Drink with grass fruit and ginger, water, and jujube in decoction to regulate the stomach qi and remove cold evils, achieving restoration. </p>
<p>After resolving the external condition, if there are alternating chills and fever, use Er Xian Drink to cut through them. Once the chills and fever are eliminated, utilize Ping Wei San with fennel soup to harmonize and mallow salt soup taken on an empty stomach.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Warming the stomach and drying the spleen, one should consume fine food and drink; when the land of the Central Plains is adequately nourished, then external evils will succumb without conflict. This is a clear statement. </p>
<p>If one has more cold than heat and the condition lasts long without improvement, it weakens the spleen and stomach, reduces appetite, alters complexion. The treatment involves using the Two Ginger Pill and the Clear Spleen Decoction. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;In summer, being harmed by heat will result in malaria in autumn.&quot; Its symptoms arise first from the fine hairs, leading to yawning; there will be chills and pain in the waist and spine. When the cold dissipates, both inner and outer heat will manifest, causing a splitting headache and thirst for cold drinks. Indeed, when evil qi converges with yang, yang prevails; when it converges with yin, yin prevails. If yin prevails, there is cold; if yang prevails, there is heat. The interplay of yin and yang causes conflict, leading to alternating cold and heat symptoms.</p>
<p>There are occurrences once a day, twice a day, or three times a day, occasional occurrences every day or on consecutive days, with symptoms appearing during both day and night, and varying with morning and evening. Some cases exhibit sweating, while others do not. This is an overview. </p>
<p>To elaborate, one should differentiate between the six channels and five organs, and the variations of phlegm, food stagnation, heat, and pestilence, along with the different manifestations of evil in the three yin meridians.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Phlegm malaria occurs when phlegm stagnates in the chest, leading to malaria, causing fullness and distension in the heart area, along with reversed qi and nauseous vomiting. Dietary malaria arises from the injury to the spleen caused by food, resulting in the person experiencing burping, sour regurgitation, and disharmony in the chest. Labor malaria occurs when the condition does not heal over time, both interior and exterior are deficient, the pathogenic factors are not dispelled, and true qi is not restored; therefore, although the disease may seem to cease, it flares up upon exertion. Heat malaria presents with a dirty complexion and thirst; even after the heat has receded, sweating persists. Ghost malaria has no specific times for its onset and remission. Miasmic malaria is caused by the influence of mountain miasma, displaying alternating cold and heat at certain times. If it occurs on Zi, Wu, Mao, or You days, it is classified as Lesser Yin malaria; on Yin, Shen, Ji, or Hai days, it is Greater Yin malaria; on Chen, Xu, Chou, or Wei days, it is called Supreme Yang malaria. This is known as the variations of the three yin. If it persists without healing, it is termed epidemic malaria. Epidemic malaria is chronic malaria. Chronic malaria that does not heal, forming a mass between the two conditions, is called the mother of malaria.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>This is initially lost due to dispersal, or it may be due to external factors like wind and cold, or internal issues from food and drink, hence the prolonged condition. The treatment principle states that when pathogens from wind and heat enter from the outside, they should be expelled; after releasing the exterior, one should support the stomach qi. Therefore, Danxi says: &quot;If there is no sweat, there should be sweat, and dispersing the pathogens is most important; if there is sweat, there should be no sweat, and maintaining the righteous qi is most important.&quot; For acute malaria, one should release the exterior; for chronic malaria, one should tonify the spleen. Cold malaria should be treated with warmth, warm malaria should be harmonized, and damp malaria should be cleared. If phlegm is present, one should expel phlegm, and if there is food stagnation, one should digest the food. For labor-induced malaria, one should provide peace, and for summer heat malaria, one should resolve it. Ghost malaria should be expelled, and swamp malaria should be dispersed. This is a concise overview. To elaborate: when heat is predominant and cold is less, Xiao Chaihu Decoction is appropriate; when cold is predominant and heat is less, Qingpi Decoction is suitable; for those without sweating, Gui Zhi Ma Huang Decoction in equal parts; for those with sweating, Chaihu Gui Zhi Decoction; for excessive sweating with thirst, Baihu Decoction; for thirst with difficulty in urination, Wuling San; for red and hot urine with excessive thirst, Xiao Chaihu Decoction; for excessive heat and sweating with abdominal fullness and constipation, Da Chaihu Decoction; and for thirst combined with Gekegen.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>For phlegm and malarial fever, use Erchen Decoction with the addition of Chai Hu and Huang Qin; in severe cases, add Zhi Shi. For food-related malaria, first use Da An Wan, then follow with Yigong San. For labor-induced and heat-induced malaria, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For summer malaria, use Shiwwei Xiangru Drink; for ghost-related malaria, use Gui Ku San; for swamp malaria, use Si Shou Drink; for malaria from the mother, use Bie Jia Drink. In all cases of spleen and stomach deficiency with malaria, regardless of sweating, use Liu Jun Zi Tang as the primary formula. If there is much heat, add Chai Hu and Shan Zhi; if there is much cold, add Gan Jiang and Rou Gui; if there is sweating, add Huang Qi and Fu Mai; if there is no sweating, add Cang Zhu and Ge Gen. If the vital energy is sinking and liver wood overacts on the spleen, also add Sheng Ma and Chai Hu. If using Qing Pi, Cao Guo, and Chang Shan as methods to attack and intercept, the righteous Qi becomes more deficient while the evil Qi becomes more entrenched, leading to prolonged labor heat. If a nursing mother experiences emotional fluctuations and dietary imbalances, or if her cold and heat symptoms resemble malaria, with excessive liver fire affecting the child, then the mother should be treated, which is the correct approach.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>&quot;The Complete Guide to Understanding Illness&quot; states: Regarding the illnesses of cold and heat, there may be cases where cold precedes heat or vice versa. If there is shivering from cold and heat, severe headache, body rigidity, frequent yawning, thirst for cold drinks, or if the condition starts with cold then shifts to heat, or vice versa, or manifests at certain times, or intermittently, and the onset is as usual, this is referred to as malaria. The pulse in cases of malaria is string-like; a string-like pulse that is rapid indicates excess heat, while a slow string-like pulse indicates excess cold. These conditions arise from the invasion of wind and cold during winter, which becomes lodged in the bones and marrow. When spring arrives with abundant yang energy, the pathogenic influence cannot escape, and upon encountering great heat, it combines with the pathogenic factors to manifest. For those with excessive cold, warming treatments such as ginger and cinnamon soup are appropriate; for excessive heat, relieving treatments such as cucumber and melon soup are suitable; for balanced cold and heat, regulating treatments such as turtle shell soup are recommended.</p>
<p>In children suffering from malaria, if cold emanates from the back and they feel cold as if their hands are scarcely trembling, seemingly wanting to develop a fever with sweating, or if headaches and vomiting occur during such episodes, their pulse is often slow and weak. This is due to the weakness of the spleen and stomach, as wind and cold gather, preventing the transformation of food and drink, which then becomes phlegm. The phlegm lies within, with yin overpowering yang, resulting in cold pressing down and leading to sweating. It is advisable to administer treatments like perilla flower pills or half-sulfur pills.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Health: Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>In children, cold and heat arise from external wind evils affecting the pores and internal phlegm and fluids permeating the organs, resulting in insufficient blood and qi, leading to the dominance of yin or yang. When yang is predominant, fever occurs; when yin prevails, cold is manifested. The struggle between yin and yang, and the interaction of evils and righteousness, cause cold and heat to alternate, sometimes appearing and sometimes stopping. This condition resembles malaria, yet with cold, there is no shaking; with heat, there is no confusion, which distinguishes it.</p>

<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: for children with warm malaria, moxibustion should be applied beneath each nipple, three times. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: for children with lingering malaria, moxibustion should be applied at the sites between the big toe and the second toe, one session for each. The &quot;Water Mirror&quot; mentions a song of the immortal regarding children&#39;s malaria, stating: malaria is an attack of evil wind, cold and heat; it must be treated properly to avoid emptiness. Shape Chang Shan into a human form and nail it to the child&#39;s vitality palace. If born in the year of metal, nail it in the position of the si; if in wood, nail it at hai; if in fire, nail it at yin; if in earth or water, nail it at shen.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Young Child&#39;s Treatise&quot; states: My son-in-law, Li Zhong&#39;an, has a son who is not yet one year old. Due to a food injury, he develops intermittent fever, which flares up every day, occurring at the hours of Zi and Chou. During the fever, he also has convulsions. At this time, he grits his teeth and cries out, with yellowish diarrhea that is difficult to expel. He clings to his mother for milk and stops feeding as soon as he gets it. After the fever, he sweats, feels a pounding heart, has abdominal rumbling, and experiences lingering warmth at the back of his head. His parents cherish him, feeling joy when the fever and convulsions subside, but are filled with worry and fear when both occur together. His mother also cannot limit his intake, and within ten days, he develops malnutrition. His complexion appears pale, with sunken cheeks and sparse hair, and he gradually becomes emaciated. They request my treatment. I said: This child has first been afflicted by summer heat and dampness. The heat causes fever, and the dampness causes phlegm; additionally, the injury from food exacerbates the heat and damp evil. Heat injures the heart, dampness injures the spleen; heat generates fire, and dampness generates phlegm. As the spleen weakens, the liver strengthens, leading to a type of fever known as food fever and malnutrition resulted from improper diet. Hence, we should treat the underlying deficiency. Furthermore, loud crying and frantic gestures indicate a disease of the liver and gallbladder, and the hour of Zi corresponds to the gallbladder.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Those who grit their teeth have both heated heart and liver; the liver corresponds to wood and the heart to fire, indicating a mother-son illness. Those who cry out from pain have liver problems, while those who groan have kidney issues; water and wood interact between the kidneys and liver, generating a mother-son illness. The liver embodies the wind-wood of the Jueyin, while the heart and kidneys represent the Shaoyin fire. When water and fire clash internally, convulsions occur, leading to yellow stools. If the mouth sucks from the mother’s mouth, it indicates internal heat causing thirst. If the child&#39;s mouth cannot speak, they resolve their issues through milk. When sweating occurs, it indicates the initial invasion of pathogenic Qi, and once it recedes with sweating, the true Qi leaks out. Therefore, in treating malaria, if there is no sweat, sweating should be induced to scatter the pathogen; if there is sweat, it must be curtailed to nourish the true Qi. The child experiences external sweating and internal diarrhea, with palpitations and abdominal rumblings, indicating a condition of excessive fire. The liver and gallbladder are treated with fire; this is the method. If the top of the head feels hot, as if there is a mountaintop, it also corresponds to the Jueyin liver meridian. I devised a formula with dual purposes, adding medicines for malnutrition to the formula that calms the liver and stops convulsions, and adding medicines to stop convulsions to the formula that tonifies the spleen and alleviates malaria. After adjusting for five days, both the malaria and convulsions resolved, and the child gradually gained weight while malnutrition was removed. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials for Protecting Infants&quot; states: A child experienced abdominal pain due to food stagnation and suffered from malaria after taking harsh purgatives, recurring in the afternoons. I believed the root Qi had descended and aimed to treat it with the “Middle Strengthening and Qi-Invigorating Decoction.” However, they were untrusting and proliferated purging and heat-clearing, which worsened the symptoms, leading to decreased appetite and diarrhea. I used the previous decoction in the morning and applied a different method with added Angelica in the evening; after a month, the child recovered.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>A young child had intermittent chills and fever every afternoon that persisted for a long time. I used Liu Jun Zi Tang with roasted ginger, making pills the size of a job&#39;s tear. After taking one pill each time, the child recovered in about ten days.</p>
<p>Another young child suffered from malaria, combined with blood in the stool and night sweats for over a year. I carefully examined the wet nurse and found she had a history of depression, coldness, heat, and blood in the stool. I first administered a modified Gui Pi Tang in the morning and a modified Xiao Yao San in the evening. I also gave the child a powdered mix of roasted peony root. After taking three to four grams with rice wine, both mother and child recovered in about a month.</p>
<p>A young child who had a malaria attack developed a fever, and after taking a digestive remedy, experienced abdominal distension and vomiting, along with swelling in the limbs. I initially used a modified Wu Wei Yi Gong San with cardamom, and all symptoms quickly subsided, allowing normal eating to resume. Later, due to overeating, the child developed diarrhea; I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with cardamom and then applied Wu Wei Yi Gong San, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child, after suffering from malaria, had abdominal distension, cough, and fatigue, associated with liver and lung qi deficiency. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, combined with poria and pinellia, until it provided relief. Later, the child had fever like malaria resulting from food damage and had blood in the stool. I applied the Four Gentlemen Decoction, along with fangfeng and bupleurum, which quickly stopped the bleeding. I then used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child nearly recovered from malaria overate, causing abdominal distension and fever, along with constipation. I used Xiao Ji Wan, Bao He Wan, and Yi Gong San, and the child recovered. Later, due to irregular eating, with chills and fever along with vomiting and diarrhea, I applied Yi Gong San, along with bupleurum and fangfeng, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>A young child, after suffering from malaria, had little appetite, experienced blood in the stool with a fever, and abdominal distension, attributed to spleen deficiency unable to regulate blood. First, Yigong San was used with additions of Shengma and Chaihu, which stopped the bleeding; then, Buzhong Yiqi Tang was administered, and food intake resumed promptly; Yigong San was continued, leading to a full recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, after malaria, presented with abdominal distension. Treatment involved Wuwu Yigong San and Siwei Feier Wan, resulting in gradual improvement, followed by Buzhong Yiqi Tang, leading to full recovery. Later, suffering from abdominal distension due to food injury with loose stools and difficult urination, Wuwu Yigong San combined with modified Jin Gui Shenqi Wan was used, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>One child, having recovered, experienced constipation. Buzhong Yiqi Tang with added Shanzhizi was used, which alleviated the urinary difficulty. After exertion leading to fever and loss of appetite, with difficult urination, Buzhong Yiqi Tang and Wuwu Yigong San with additions of Shengma and Chaihu were used, resulting in recovery. Subsequently, each time under mental strain, experiencing chills and fevers similar to malaria, Buzhong Yiqi Tang was used; when food intake was irregular, Wuwu Yigong San facilitated recovery.</p>
<p>A 14-year-old boy, after malaria, had abdominal bloating and difficult urination, attributed to cold spleen and kidney deficiency. In the morning, Buzhong Yiqi Tang was administered, and in the evening, modified Jin Gui Shenqi Wan was given, leading to recovery. After marriage, he experienced morning chills and evening fevers, with noticeable weight loss. When given nourishing Yin decoctions, phlegm intensified with fever and bloating, along with difficult urination. Again, Buzhong Yiqi Tang was provided in the morning, with modified Jin Gui Shenqi Wan in the evening, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>A young child with malaria was recovering but began to overeat, resulting in abdominal bloating, fever, and constipation. I treated him with digestive pills and herbal formulas to harmonize the spleen and stomach, and he recovered. Later, he had irregular eating habits that led to cold and heat symptoms with vomiting and diarrhea. I first administered Wei Ling Powder to stop the vomiting and diarrhea; then I used Yi Gong Powder, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma, and he recovered from the cold and heat.</p>
<p>Another child, fifteen years old, developed a fever and phlegm after recovering from malaria. I believed it was due to a change in spleen energy, but he would not listen and took yellow drugs and Zhimu, experiencing all the related symptoms. He asked me why his symptoms were severe with a strong stomach fire and dampness. I replied that the problem was in the yin of the spleen, which prefers warmth but was affected by cold and dampness. The medicines previously used were too harsh, damaging his vital energy further, hence the worsening of his condition. I then administered a combination of Liu Jun Zi, Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, and Mu Xiang, and his symptoms improved significantly. I supplemented this with Yi Gong Powder, adding Chai Hu and Sheng Ma to gradually restore his vital energy. </p>
<p>Afterwards, he experienced fever like malaria again, treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, but the cold and heat intensified along with cold hands and feet. I prescribed additional cooling remedies. He had difficulty with bowel movements; when he managed to urinate, the stools would come out first. I concluded this was due to the depletion of yin essence that had further been harmed, indicating a dangerous condition of kidney deficiency and cold. I used large doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Ba Wei Di Huang Wan, delighted that he could finally recover with the clearing of his symptoms.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Malaria</strong></p>
<p>There are two methods for treating malaria: for acute malaria, one should first stop the attack and then replenish; for chronic malaria, one should first replenish and then stop the attack. When treating malaria, it is important to differentiate between morning and evening treatments.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Malaria</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: Malaria occurs when summer heat harms the body, causing heat to accumulate in the skin. By autumn, due to labor and the depletion of blood energy, the pores become weak and external evils take advantage of this, leading to conflict between the residual summer heat and the body&#39;s defenses. When the yang is excessive, heat arises; when the yin is excessive, cold results. This back-and-forth of yin and yang leads to exacerbation or diminishment of both. Consequently, fevers and chills emerge; when yin and yang separate, both symptoms cease. However, if external evils disturb the body&#39;s energy again, the conflict can reoccur.</p>
<p>If a child contracts malaria without direct exposure to summer heat, it is likely due to the wet nurse not avoiding wind and cold while carrying and nursing the child. Wind evils harm the skin, and phlegm accumulates in the organs, creating a disharmony in blood and energy, and leading to conflict between yin and yang. If the vital energy prevails, the evil energy retreats; but if the evil energy is not entirely expelled, malaria will manifest.</p>
<p>Even if the evil energy recedes, the yin and blood remain deficient, allowing the evils to disturb the vital energy. The heat within the organs may not dissipate, leading to lingering heat. When the illness first manifests and chills and fevers clash, heat will invade the organs, causing dryness and thirst. If fluids stagnate and form a habit, it may lead to hardened areas under the ribs after recovery. If drinking is unending and urination is scanty, it may result in complications.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>The classics say: &quot;In summer, one suffers from heat, and in autumn there must be intermittent fevers.&quot; Those with mild afflictions are affected quickly, while those with severe ones are affected later and develop malaria. Malaria is a lingering condition of intermittent fevers. This indicates that in summer, one suffers from the heat and cannot release it, causing the evil Qi to act internally, which results in fever by autumn. </p>
<p>This is largely due to nurses holding babies without protection from wind and cold, and also because of exposure to hot and humid weather, leading to evil Qi lodging in the skin and lingering in the organs. The imbalance between Yin and Yang causes the evil and the right Qi to contend, resulting in alternating chills and fevers. If Yang is dominant, there is heat; if Yin is dominant, there is cold. The sequence of chills followed by heat indicates insufficient Yang; the sequence of heat followed by chills indicates insufficient Yin; more cold and less heat indicates that Yin is winning; more heat and less cold indicates that Yang is winning; equal amounts of cold and heat show that Yin and Yang are contending; alternating chills and fevers indicate a sudden separation of Yin and Yang. Generally, children mostly suffer from illnesses arising from diet, so one must first resolve and guide their digestion, and then adapt the treatment according to the source of their illness; this is the best method.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p>For treating childhood malaria, many methods are the same as those for adults, focusing on inducing sweating for recovery, and thus using ingredients like cinnamon twig, bupleurum, ephedra, ginseng, and poria. Additionally, one should observe the patients&#39; diet and phlegm in accordance with their condition. Generally, this illness arises from dietary irregularities, so guiding digestion should be prioritized.</p>
<p>According to the discussions on malaria in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: both intermittent fever and malaria arise from wind and occur at certain times. Qi Bo said: &quot;If one is harmed by summer heat, malaria will certainly develop in autumn.&quot; This refers to the opening of pores where sweat is produced, encountering wind, or from bathing, causing moisture to linger on the skin. When the protective qi is weak, pathogenic factors can invade, resulting in the onset of the disease with cold shivers, pain in the waist and back, and aching joints. When the cold dissipates, there is heat both internally and externally, accompanied by headaches and thirst. This situation arises from the clash between the yin and yang vital energies, leading to alternation between deficiency and excess. When yin energy is predominant, yang is deficient, resulting in initial cold and shivers, with pain in the waist, back, head, and joints; when yang energy prevails, yin is deficient, leading to initial heat.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the body is in the initial stages of an illness, there are no cravings for food and a tendency to vomit, with headaches and back pain, and urination is not smooth. When yin is strong and yang is weak, there is cold internally and externally; when yang is strong and yin is weak, there is heat both internally and externally. Additionally, one may be affected by the six pathogenic influences or internal emotional injuries, leading to the accumulation of phlegm and fluid, causing the pathogenic qi and defensive qi to coexist, thus the illness worsens daily. The defensive qi moves in the daytime with yang and in the nighttime with yin. When it departs with yang, it retreats with yin. If the internal organs become weak, the pathogenic qi penetrates deeply and cannot exit with the defensive qi, thus it manifests intermittently. Wherever the defensive qi goes, the location of the pathogenic qi also manifests. In yang conditions, there is heat, and in yin conditions, there is cold. The classic texts state: excessive yang leads to harm, while extremes eventually reverse. When yin and yang each weaken and the defensive qi separates from the pathogenic qi, the illness abates; but when yin and yang clash, and the defensive qi and pathogenic qi reunite, the illness recurs. Each follows its defensive qi and interacts with the corresponding pathogenic qi. If cold precedes heat, it is termed &quot;cold malaria&quot;; if heat precedes cold, it is termed &quot;warm malaria.&quot; If there is heat without cold, it is termed &quot;damp malaria.&quot; Symptoms include a heavy body, alternating chills and fever, bone and joint pain, abdominal distension, spontaneous sweating, and a tendency to vomit, which are all classified as &quot;damp malaria.&quot;<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cold without heat is called &quot;female malaria.&quot; The nature of malaria as a disease is varied, which is why prescriptions are tailored according to its yin and yang, deficiency and excess, pulse and symptoms. Treatments should be adjusted for sweating, vomiting, purging, or warming, aiming for balance. Among various illnesses, it is important to recognize that due to the deficiency of righteous qi, one can be susceptible to evil qi, which lingers and does not disperse; this leads to a substantive illness. The methods for treating malaria have remained unchanged through the ages—first induce sweating followed by purging. Therefore, the treatment for malaria must begin from the exterior using &quot;Bai Jie San,&quot; and decoction of ginger and scallions; then follow with Xiao Chai Hu Tang mixed with cinnamon and a ginger and jujube decoction to harmonize and resolve the exterior and interior evils, which is naturally effective. If both the exterior and interior are substantial, use Dang Gui San, Wu He Tang, or Wu Xi Wan, Liusheng Wan for purging, harmonizing qi to stop supplementation, and finally use Huo Xiang Drink with grass fruit and ginger, water, and jujube in decoction to regulate the stomach qi and remove cold evils, achieving restoration. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Warming the stomach and drying the spleen, one should consume fine food and drink; when the land of the Central Plains is adequately nourished, then external evils will succumb without conflict. This is a clear statement. </p>
<p>If one has more cold than heat and the condition lasts long without improvement, it weakens the spleen and stomach, reduces appetite, alters complexion. The treatment involves using the Two Ginger Pill and the Clear Spleen Decoction. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;In summer, being harmed by heat will result in malaria in autumn.&quot; Its symptoms arise first from the fine hairs, leading to yawning; there will be chills and pain in the waist and spine. When the cold dissipates, both inner and outer heat will manifest, causing a splitting headache and thirst for cold drinks. Indeed, when evil qi converges with yang, yang prevails; when it converges with yin, yin prevails. If yin prevails, there is cold; if yang prevails, there is heat. The interplay of yin and yang causes conflict, leading to alternating cold and heat symptoms.</p>
<p>There are occurrences once a day, twice a day, or three times a day, occasional occurrences every day or on consecutive days, with symptoms appearing during both day and night, and varying with morning and evening. Some cases exhibit sweating, while others do not. This is an overview. </p>
<p>To elaborate, one should differentiate between the six channels and five organs, and the variations of phlegm, food stagnation, heat, and pestilence, along with the different manifestations of evil in the three yin meridians.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Phlegm malaria occurs when phlegm stagnates in the chest, leading to malaria, causing fullness and distension in the heart area, along with reversed qi and nauseous vomiting. Dietary malaria arises from the injury to the spleen caused by food, resulting in the person experiencing burping, sour regurgitation, and disharmony in the chest. Labor malaria occurs when the condition does not heal over time, both interior and exterior are deficient, the pathogenic factors are not dispelled, and true qi is not restored; therefore, although the disease may seem to cease, it flares up upon exertion. Heat malaria presents with a dirty complexion and thirst; even after the heat has receded, sweating persists. Ghost malaria has no specific times for its onset and remission. Miasmic malaria is caused by the influence of mountain miasma, displaying alternating cold and heat at certain times. If it occurs on Zi, Wu, Mao, or You days, it is classified as Lesser Yin malaria; on Yin, Shen, Ji, or Hai days, it is Greater Yin malaria; on Chen, Xu, Chou, or Wei days, it is called Supreme Yang malaria. This is known as the variations of the three yin. If it persists without healing, it is termed epidemic malaria. Epidemic malaria is chronic malaria. Chronic malaria that does not heal, forming a mass between the two conditions, is called the mother of malaria.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

The treatment principle states that when pathogens from wind and heat enter from the outside, they should be expelled; after releasing the exterior, one should support the stomach qi. Therefore, Danxi says: &quot;If there is no sweat, there should be sweat, and dispersing the pathogens is most important; if there is sweat, there should be no sweat, and maintaining the righteous qi is most important.&quot; For acute malaria, one should release the exterior; for chronic malaria, one should tonify the spleen. Cold malaria should be treated with warmth, warm malaria should be harmonized, and damp malaria should be cleared. If phlegm is present, one should expel phlegm, and if there is food stagnation, one should digest the food. For labor-induced malaria, one should provide peace, and for summer heat malaria, one should resolve it. Ghost malaria should be expelled, and swamp malaria should be dispersed. This is a concise overview.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Complete Guide to Understanding Illness&quot; states: Regarding the illnesses of cold and heat, there may be cases where cold precedes heat or vice versa. If there is shivering from cold and heat, severe headache, body rigidity, frequent yawning, thirst for cold drinks, or if the condition starts with cold then shifts to heat, or vice versa, or manifests at certain times, or intermittently, and the onset is as usual, this is referred to as malaria. The pulse in cases of malaria is string-like; a string-like pulse that is rapid indicates excess heat, while a slow string-like pulse indicates excess cold. These conditions arise from the invasion of wind and cold during winter, which becomes lodged in the bones and marrow. When spring arrives with abundant yang energy, the pathogenic influence cannot escape, and upon encountering great heat, it combines with the pathogenic factors to manifest. For those with excessive cold, warming treatments such as ginger and cinnamon soup are appropriate; for excessive heat, relieving treatments such as cucumber and melon soup are suitable; for balanced cold and heat, regulating treatments such as turtle shell soup are recommended.</p>
<p>In children suffering from malaria, if cold emanates from the back and they feel cold as if their hands are scarcely trembling, seemingly wanting to develop a fever with sweating, or if headaches and vomiting occur during such episodes, their pulse is often slow and weak. This is due to the weakness of the spleen and stomach, as wind and cold gather, preventing the transformation of food and drink, which then becomes phlegm. The phlegm lies within, with yin overpowering yang, resulting in cold pressing down and leading to sweating. It is advisable to administer treatments like perilla flower pills or half-sulfur pills.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Health: Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>In children, cold and heat arise from external wind evils affecting the pores and internal phlegm and fluids permeating the organs, resulting in insufficient blood and qi, leading to the dominance of yin or yang. When yang is predominant, fever occurs; when yin prevails, cold is manifested. The struggle between yin and yang, and the interaction of evils and righteousness, cause cold and heat to alternate, sometimes appearing and sometimes stopping. This condition resembles malaria, yet with cold, there is no shaking; with heat, there is no confusion, which distinguishes it.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Young Child&#39;s Treatise&quot; states: My son-in-law, Li Zhong&#39;an, has a son who is not yet one year old. Due to a food injury, he develops intermittent fever, which flares up every day, occurring at the hours of Zi and Chou. During the fever, he also has convulsions. At this time, he grits his teeth and cries out, with yellowish diarrhea that is difficult to expel. He clings to his mother for milk and stops feeding as soon as he gets it. After the fever, he sweats, feels a pounding heart, has abdominal rumbling, and experiences lingering warmth at the back of his head. His parents cherish him, feeling joy when the fever and convulsions subside, but are filled with worry and fear when both occur together. His mother also cannot limit his intake, and within ten days, he develops malnutrition. His complexion appears pale, with sunken cheeks and sparse hair, and he gradually becomes emaciated. They request my treatment. I said: This child has first been afflicted by summer heat and dampness. The heat causes fever, and the dampness causes phlegm; additionally, the injury from food exacerbates the heat and damp evil. Heat injures the heart, dampness injures the spleen; heat generates fire, and dampness generates phlegm. As the spleen weakens, the liver strengthens, leading to a type of fever known as food fever and malnutrition resulted from improper diet. Hence, we should treat the underlying deficiency. Furthermore, loud crying and frantic gestures indicate a disease of the liver and gallbladder, and the hour of Zi corresponds to the gallbladder.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who grit their teeth have both heated heart and liver; the liver corresponds to wood and the heart to fire, indicating a mother-son illness. Those who cry out from pain have liver problems, while those who groan have kidney issues; water and wood interact between the kidneys and liver, generating a mother-son illness. The liver embodies the wind-wood of the Jueyin, while the heart and kidneys represent the Shaoyin fire. When water and fire clash internally, convulsions occur, leading to yellow stools. If the mouth sucks from the mother’s mouth, it indicates internal heat causing thirst. If the child&#39;s mouth cannot speak, they resolve their issues through milk. When sweating occurs, it indicates the initial invasion of pathogenic Qi, and once it recedes with sweating, the true Qi leaks out. Therefore, in treating malaria, if there is no sweat, sweating should be induced to scatter the pathogen; if there is sweat, it must be curtailed to nourish the true Qi. The child experiences external sweating and internal diarrhea, with palpitations and abdominal rumblings, indicating a condition of excessive fire. The liver and gallbladder are treated with fire; this is the method. If the top of the head feels hot, as if there is a mountaintop, it also corresponds to the Jueyin liver meridian. I devised a formula with dual purposes, adding medicines for malnutrition to the formula that calms the liver and stops convulsions, and adding medicines to stop convulsions to the formula that tonifies the spleen and alleviates malaria. After adjusting for five days, both the malaria and convulsions resolved, and the child gradually gained weight while malnutrition was removed. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials for Protecting Infants&quot; states: A child experienced abdominal pain due to food stagnation and suffered from malaria after taking harsh purgatives, recurring in the afternoons. I believed the root Qi had descended and aimed to treat it with the “Middle Strengthening and Qi-Invigorating Decoction.” However, they were untrusting and proliferated purging and heat-clearing, which worsened the symptoms, leading to decreased appetite and diarrhea. I used the previous decoction in the morning and applied a different method with added Angelica in the evening; after a month, the child recovered.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another child, after malaria, presented with abdominal distension.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child with malaria was recovering but began to overeat, resulting in abdominal bloating, fever, and constipation. I treated him with digestive pills and herbal formulas to harmonize the spleen and stomach, and he recovered. Later, he had irregular eating habits that led to cold and heat symptoms with vomiting and diarrhea. I first administered Wei Ling Powder to stop the vomiting and diarrhea; then I used Yi Gong Powder, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma, and he recovered from the cold and heat.</p>
<p>Another child, fifteen years old, developed a fever and phlegm after recovering from malaria. I believed it was due to a change in spleen energy, but he would not listen and took yellow drugs and Zhimu, experiencing all the related symptoms. He asked me why his symptoms were severe with a strong stomach fire and dampness. I replied that the problem was in the yin of the spleen, which prefers warmth but was affected by cold and dampness. The medicines previously used were too harsh, damaging his vital energy further, hence the worsening of his condition. I then administered a combination of Liu Jun Zi, Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, and Mu Xiang, and his symptoms improved significantly. I supplemented this with Yi Gong Powder, adding Chai Hu and Sheng Ma to gradually restore his vital energy. </p>
<p>Afterwards, he experienced fever like malaria again, treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, but the cold and heat intensified along with cold hands and feet. I prescribed additional cooling remedies. He had difficulty with bowel movements; when he managed to urinate, the stools would come out first. I concluded this was due to the depletion of yin essence that had further been harmed, indicating a dangerous condition of kidney deficiency and cold. I used large doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Ba Wei Di Huang Wan, delighted that he could finally recover with the clearing of his symptoms.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>
