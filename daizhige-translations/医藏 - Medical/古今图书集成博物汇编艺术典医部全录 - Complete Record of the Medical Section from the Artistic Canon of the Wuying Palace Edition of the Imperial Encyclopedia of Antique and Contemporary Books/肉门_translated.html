<p><strong>The Meat Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Manifestations of the Six Organs</strong></p>
<p>The spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, sanjiao (triple burner), and bladder are the foundation of storage; they house nourishment and are collectively referred to as “the器” (vessel). These organs transform the impure into essence, varying flavors as they intake and expel. Its manifestation is seen in the four white areas of the lips, its fullness resides in the flesh; its flavor is sweet, and its color is yellow. This represents the extreme yin, which corresponds to the earth&#39;s energy. </p>
<p>[Note: The foot of the Greater Yin receives the impurity of food and drink, serving as the conduit for transportation. The intestines and stomach lead in receiving and transmitting food and drink, the sanjiao governs the regulation of water pathways, while the bladder is the reservoir for water essence; thus, they are all fundamental to storage. The spleen houses nourishment, hence it is the dwelling for nourishment. The term &quot;器&quot; denotes the universe of generation and transformation, capable of rising, descending, entering, and exiting. The spleen can process the impure and transform flavors that nourish the five organs, while expelling waste through the two yin organs; hence it is called a vessel. The &quot;four whites&quot; refer to the white flesh surrounding the four corners of the lips. The mouth serves as an orifice of the spleen and governs the flesh, hence its manifestation appears at the four white areas of the lips, its fullness exists in the flesh. Sweetness corresponds to the flavor of earth, and yellow represents its color. The spleen is the utmost yin within yin, corresponding to the earth&#39;s energy. This section refers specifically to the spleen, while the intestines, stomach, sanjiao, and bladder engage in receiving and transmitting both the essence and residue of food and drink, thus being collectively called the foundation of storage. The receiver of impurities is defined as yin; hence it is referred to as the extreme yin.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The spleen is associated with flesh; its manifestation is in the lips, and it is governed by the liver. [Note: The spleen governs the central earth and is in charge of the granaries, responsible for processing and transforming the essences of food and water to nourish the muscles and flesh, hence its association with meat. The spleen opens at the mouth, which is why its manifestation is in the lips. The spleen is earth and is constrained by the liver&#39;s wood; thus, the liver is the main organ generating the spleen.] Eating too much sour food leads to the flesh becoming rigid and the lips becoming curled, as this hurts the five flavors. [Note: Consuming too much sour food represents an excess of the wood flavor, which damages the spleen, causing the flesh to become rigid and the lips to curl. The five flavors are meant to nourish the five organs; if one organ becomes excessive, the organ that it is incompatible with will be harmed; this illustrates the principle that constraints should not be exceeded.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Theory on the Soul of the Spleen</strong></p>
<p>The essence of the spleen is moist, and it stores the energy of the muscles.<br><em>(Note: The primordial essence of the earth organ is moist in the spleen and governs the storage of the energy of the muscles.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Discourse on the Spleen&#39;s Qi</strong></p>
<p>Those with spleen disorders feel heavy in their bodies, their muscles are prone to atrophy, their feet cannot retract, and they experience pain beneath their feet.<br><em>(Note: The spleen governs the muscles and is responsible for the flow of primordial essence. When the spleen&#39;s energy is harmed, the body feels heavy, and the muscles are prone to atrophy. Atrophy refers to the muscles being abandoned and lacking vitality. The foot&#39;s Taiyin meridian runs along the legs and knees; if evil exists in the meridian, the feet cannot retract. Energy injury leads to atrophy and pain. This describes a meridian disorder that affects energy.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Exposition on the Five Energies</strong></p>
<p>Sweetness nourishes the flesh; one with meat disorders should not eat too much sweetness.<br><em>(Note: The spleen governs the muscles, and sweetness is the flavor of earth. Eating too much sweetness when there is spleen disease harms the spleen&#39;s energy.)</em><br>Yin diseases manifest in the flesh.<br><em>(Note: The spleen represents the utmost yin, and in the body, it is flesh; thus, diseases of the Taiyin manifest in the muscles it governs.)</em><br>The spleen governs the flesh; prolonged sitting harms the flesh.<br><em>(Note: The primordial essence of the five organs connects to the flesh and skin; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the five organs, hence its dominion over the flesh. The spleen thrives on movement; therefore, prolonged sitting harms the flesh.)</em><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Blood and Qi, Form and Intention</strong></p>
<p>Form rejoices and intention rejoices; illness arises from the flesh, treated with needles and stones.<br><em>Note: Excessive comfort leads to the mind&#39;s inability to turn; blood and qi become stagnant, resulting in illness from the flesh, thus requiring treatment with needles and stones to draw and open it.</em></p>
<p>Form experiences shock and fear; meridians become blocked, and illness arises from insensitivity. Treated with massage and medicinal decoctions.<br><em>Note: Shock disrupts qi, and fear causes qi to descend; blood follows qi. When qi is disordered, meridians fail to function, and the vital and defensive energies do not circulate, resulting in illness from insensitivity. Therefore, massage and medicinal decoctions should be used to promote the circulation of vital and defensive blood and qi.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Reversal and Regulation</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: For a person whose flesh is harsh, even when near soft clothing, it still feels harsh. What illness does this signify? Qi Bo replied: The nourishing qi is weak, while the protective qi is strong. When the nourishing qi is weak, insensitivity arises; when the protective qi is strong, it cannot be used. If both the nourishing and defensive energies are weak, it results in insensitivity and ineffectiveness, leaving the flesh unchanged.<br><em>Note: &quot;Harsh&quot; means cruel. Even when flesh is close to soft clothing, it still feels cruel. Weakness and strength indicate imbalance. The nourishing qi cannot harmonize with the protective qi, leading to the weakness of the nourishing qi and the strength of the protective qi. The path of yang is always strong, hence it is called strong. Thus, excess is as bad as deficiency. Insensitivity is the inability to feel pain or itch, while ineffectiveness means weakness and an inability to function. The phrase indicates the disharmony between nourishing and protective energies, both being weak. When both energies are weak, there is insensitivity and ineffectiveness, and insensitivity and ineffectiveness with unchanged harshness of flesh indicate a lack of harmony, resulting in weakness.</em><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Bi (Obstruction)</strong></p>
<p>When Bi (obstruction) is in the flesh, it is not benevolent.<br><em>[Note: The visceral qi externally combines with the physical body; if the physical form is affected but does not harm its qi, one can only see that the flesh is unresponsive without pain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wei (Atrophy)</strong></p>
<p>There is a gradual effect from dampness; concerning water, if something remains, and one resides in dampness, the flesh becomes moist and soaked, leading to obstructions and lack of responsiveness, resulting in muscle atrophy. Therefore, it is said in the &quot;Lower Scriptures&quot;: those with muscle atrophy obtain it from damp ground.<br><em>[Note: The gradual effect from dampness refers to the earth&#39;s qi being in the lower region. &quot;Concerning water&quot; implies a fondness for drinking moist liquids, leaving damp and turbid substances within. If there is a retention of dampness and turbidities, and one resides in low places, with internal and external dampness affecting the flesh, it results in the flesh becoming soaked, leading to obstructions and lack of responsiveness, culminating in muscle atrophy.]</em></p>
<p>When the spleen qi is hot, it causes the stomach to dry up and thirst, resulting in unresponsiveness of the flesh and muscle atrophy.<br><em>[Note: The Yangming dryness of metal governs qi, revealing the dampness of Taiyin transforming from within, hence when spleen qi is hot, the stomach dries up and one feels thirsty. The qi of the spleen and stomach both govern the flesh; at this time, the fluids of Yangming do not produce, and the qi of Taiyin does not arrive, causing the flesh to be unresponsive and leading to muscle atrophy.]</em><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Qi and Cavities</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear about the convergence in the valleys. Qi Bo replied: The major convergence of flesh is in the valley, while the minor convergence is in the creek. Between the divisions of flesh, the convergence of creeks and valleys enables the flow of nourishment and defense, congregating great qi. If evil qi overflows and obstructs, causing the pulse to heat and the flesh to decay, and if nourishment and defense do not circulate, it will inevitably lead to pus. If internal consumption affects the bone marrow and externally it damages the major joints, and if it lingers at the joints, it will certainly lead to failure. Accumulation of cold lingers and the nourishment and defense do not reside, causing the flesh to shrink and muscles to contract, resulting in inability to extend the ribs and elbows; internally this leads to bone numbness, and externally to lack of sensation, termed insufficiency; this is the great cold residing in the valleys. The creeks and valleys gather three hundred sixty-five cavities, corresponding to the year. Minor numbness and overflow travel along the pulse; where fine needles reach, it aligns with the principle. </p>
<p><em>Note: The flesh has major divisions, like the meat of the thigh and arm, each with its own boundaries; minor divisions refer to the inner muscle tissue, which also has patterns and lines. Despite the division, they interconnect, thus the major division is the major convergence, and the minor division is the minor convergence. Between the divisions, the flow of the nourishment and defense qi gives the name &#39;creek and valley.&#39; Great qi refers to ancestral qi. Qi is yang; if evil remains in the superficial layers of the flesh, when evil and righteousness clash, it results in pathogenic heat, hence the diseases manifest as pus and decay.</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>When evil qi overflows, the righteous qi becomes obstructed. The energy of the streams and valleys connects with the meridians; thus, when the pulse is hot inside, the flesh decays outside. If the flow of nourishment and defense is impaired, then blood and qi stagnate and become obstructed. If pus and evil stagnate between the joints and flesh, then the tendons and bones will surely deteriorate. The accumulation of cold leads to the inability of nourishment and defense to reside within, causing the cold evil to stagnate and not be harmonized by righteous qi, resulting in the flesh curling and the tendons contracting. The ribs and elbows serve as the joints of the tendons and bones, hence they cannot stretch or relax. Evil is obstructed outside, causing internal bone blockages. When the nourishment and defense rebel inward, this results in outward numbness, termed insufficiency. The overflow of heat evil signifies excess, while the nature of cold is stagnation, hence leading to insufficiency. This great cold evil lingers between the streams and valleys, causing illness to the tendons and bones. Within the streams and valleys, there are also three hundred sixty-five points corresponding to a year, akin to the pathways of the sun. These can be pierced with fine needles to expel the evil. Minor blockages refer to the initial invasion of evil into the skin, without harming the tendons and bones. The meridian referred to is the sun pathway. When the evil resides in the skin and travels along the meridian, treating it with expulsion is similar to the method for the sun pathway, and it is not necessary to inquire about the specific points. This speaks to how evil initially invades a person; it starts with the skin, then the sun pathway, enters the muscles, and affects the tendons and bones. When it is still shallow, fine needles can easily disperse it, preventing it from penetrating deeply and causing major blockage.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Regulating Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>When the blood and qi have not yet combined, the five organs stabilize, and the muscles move, it is called a slight breeze. 【Note: &quot;Move&quot; refers to the actions of insects. When the wind harms the defense, the defensive qi flows through the muscles, hence the movement.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seasonal Response</strong></p>
<p>In the case of excess in the Taiyin, one suffers from muscle paralysis and internal cold; in cases of deficiency, one suffers from spleen paralysis. 【Note: When there is excess externally, it results in muscle paralysis; when there is deficiency internally, it leads to spleen paralysis.】 The Qi of late summer resides in the muscles. Late summer is when all channels are abundant, overflowing into the muscles.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Governance of the Five Constant Seasons</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyang governs the heavens; when water and drink accumulate internally, one may feel fullness without appetite, with skin and muscles becoming rigid, leading to obstructed tendons, and in severe cases, swelling and boils on the back. 【Note: When the Taiyang governs the sky, the Taiyin&#39;s damp earth is in the springs. When water and drink accumulate, it causes skin rigidity and muscle hardship, all being the illnesses from water and damp. Boils on the back are those that erupt there.】 The Jueyin governs the heavens; as the wind descends, spleen qi rises, the body feels heavy, the muscles weaken, appetite decreases, and one experiences dryness in the mouth, with the wind moving through the vastness, clouds and objects shaking, and eyes turning with ringing in the ears. 【Note: In the season of prosperity, it resembles earth, and the organ involved is the spleen. When earth follows wood transformation, it undergoes defeat, thus leading to heaviness of the body and decreased appetite as a spleen-related illness. The turning of the eyes and ringing in the ears correspond with the movement of wind above.】<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on the Six Parameters</strong></p>
<p>The sun governs the heavenly affairs; the four atmospheres—wind and damp—are in conflict, causing the wind to transform into rain, enabling growth and maturation. The people suffer from great heat and diminished energy, with muscle atrophy, weakness in the legs, and abnormal discharges of red and white. [Note: The additional atmospheric influences are attributed to the retreating wind and wood of the Jueyin phase, while the primary energy of the four comes from the Taiyin, associated with damp earth; thus, the conflict of wind and damp gives rise to rain, corresponding to seasonal transformations. Between summer and autumn, the damp earth is predominant, leading to growth and maturation. Generally, summer signifies growth, and autumn signifies maturation, whereas late summer is associated with transformation. The ailments of great heat and diminished energy arise from wind-heat disorders. Muscle atrophy and leg weakness stem from the influence of damp earth. Abnormal discharges of red and white result from the interaction of damp and heat.]</p>
<p><strong>The Essential Principles of the True and Ultimate</strong></p>
<p>The predominance of the sun leads to conditions such as hemorrhoids and malaria; when cold and deficiency invade the stomach, internal heart pain arises, leading to sores within, with obstacles in the hidden channels, and constriction of muscles and tendons. [Note: The &quot;Lingshu Sutra&quot; states: The foot Taiyang is responsible for illnesses caused by the muscles; conditions such as hemorrhoids and malaria are manifestations of the cold and heat associated with the sun. When deficiency reverses into the stomach, it implies water attacking earth. The stomach&#39;s network connects to the heart, hence the heart pain. Sores arise from the hidden channels being obstructed, inducing tension in the muscles and tendons, which the foot Taiyang regulates.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Lingshu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Longevity and Short Life</strong></p>
<p>Bojiao said: When the body and Qi are in harmony, one attains longevity; when they are not in harmony, one meets with early death. If the body is full and large, and the flesh is firm and well-defined, then the flesh is strong, leading to longevity. If the body is full and large, but the flesh lacks definition and is not firm, then the flesh is fragile, resulting in early death. <strong>[Note: The spleen governs the earth and is responsible for flesh. Firm flesh leads to longevity; unfirm flesh leads to early death. This relates to the varying thickness of the postnatal earth.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the True Spirit</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is anxious and preoccupied with thoughts, it harms the spirit. When the spirit is harmed, fear and anxiety result in a loss of composure, leading to the deterioration of flesh and a pale complexion, resulting in death during winter. <strong>[Note: Worrying is related to the spleen&#39;s emotions. If the heart is anxious and preoccupied, it harms the spirit of the heart. When the spirit is harmed, it cannot maintain control, leading to fear and loss of composure. The spleen governs the earth and is responsible for muscle, while the lungs govern Qi and control the skin. The fatty essence of flesh is termed (Meat Essence), and color is the manifestation of Qi. The essence of flesh is formed from earth, while the hair color is born of the heavens. The deterioration of flesh and pale complexion signifies the end of life born of heaven and earth.

<p>When the Qi of the Foot Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse does not nourish the muscles. The lips and tongue are the foundation of the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish, the muscles become soft; when the muscles are soft, the flesh withers. When the flesh withers, the lips invert; when the lips invert, the flesh perishes first. The essence of one dies, and the essence of the other dies; wood conquers earth.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Qi of the Foot Taiyin originates in the spleen. The spleen stores nourishment and externally governs the muscles. Thus, when the Qi of the Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse does not nourish the muscles. The spleen opens to the mouth, governing the welcoming of food, which is why the lips and tongue are the foundation of the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish, the muscles wither and the lips invert, indicating the external exhaustion of the Taiyin&#39;s vital Qi. The essence of one dies, and the essence of the other dies, indicating the internal death of the spleen’s Qi.</p>
<p><strong>Five Types of Fluids Section</strong></p>
<p>In hot weather, if one wears thick clothing, the pores open, thus causing sweating; if cold lingers between the flesh layers, it gathers and causes pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pores refer to the texture and structure between the flesh layers. Fluids follow the Triple Burner to exit, pooling between the skin and muscles. Therefore, when the pores are open, sweat is released abundantly. If there is cold that lingers and gathers between the flesh layers, it splits the flesh and causes pain. Foam occurs when fluids gather and become frothy.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we determine why people easily suffer from wind-cold and excessive sweating? Shao Yu replied: If the flesh is not firm and the pores are loose, one is prone to wind. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we tell if the flesh is not firm? Shao Yu answered: The flesh behind the knee is not firm and lacks clear texture; the texture is coarse, and if the skin does not seal well, then the pores are loose, indicating a lack of integrity in the body.</p>
<p>[Note: Zhu Yongnian said: This indicates that if the skin is not tightly sealed, and the flesh&#39;s texture is coarse and loose, it allows for wind pathogens to invade internally, resulting in excessive sweating. The area below the knee is referred to as &quot;ji,&quot; which corresponds to the solar region. The solar energy governs the skin, thus if the knee flesh is not firm and lacks clear texture, it means the texture is coarse. If the texture is coarse and the skin does not seal tightly, then the pores are loose, leading to a natural outpouring of sweat.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we determine why some people are prone to blockages? Shao Yu replied: If the texture is coarse and the flesh is not firm, then one is prone to blockages. The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a place that indicates the severity of blockages? Shao Yu answered: To understand their severity, one must look at their respective regions.</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Texture&quot; refers to the patterns of muscles; if the texture is coarse and loose rather than tight, then pathogens linger and cause blockages. The skin, flesh, veins, muscles, bones, and the divisions of the five internal organs constitute different areas.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The Treatise on Bi (Obstruction) states: When the three Qi of wind, cold, and dampness come together, they combine to form Bi. Those who encounter this in winter have bone Bi, in spring have sinew Bi, in summer have vessel Bi, in the depths of winter have muscle Bi, and in autumn have skin Bi. Therefore, by observing the respective parts, one can understand the severity of Bi. Generally, Bi affecting the heart and lungs is classified as high, while that affecting the liver, kidneys, and spleen is classified as low. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we discern diseases caused by accumulation in the intestines? Shao Yu responded: When the skin is thin and lacks moisture, and the flesh is not firm but becomes damp, this leads to a deterioration of the intestines and stomach. Such deterioration causes evil Qi to stagnate and accumulate, which harms the spleen and stomach. If cold and warmth are not properly balanced, and evil Qi gradually enters, this leads to stagnation and significant accumulation. </p>
<p>Note: When the skin is thin and does not ensure a healthy moisture, and the flesh is not firm leading to lack of fluid, this results in a deterioration of the intestines and stomach. Indeed, fluid, blood, and Qi are generated from the intestines and stomach; when these deteriorate, evil Qi stagnates and leads to accumulation, which harms the spleen and stomach. If one continues to eat unregulated, with improper heating and cooling, and evil Qi enters, this fosters stagnation and significant accumulation. The intestines connect with the lungs and govern the skin and Qi, while the stomach connects with the spleen and governs flesh and fluid. Therefore, when the skin is thin and the flesh not firm, the Qi lacks fullness and fluid does not nourish. Without fullness of Qi and nourishment of fluid, the hair follicles open and pores loosen; this allows evil Qi to stagnate, gradually seeping into the intestines and stomach and resulting in accumulation.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>On the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The protective qi is what regulates the flesh, nourishes the skin, promotes fat and pores, and is responsible for opening and closing. When the protective qi is harmonized, the flesh is well-dispersed, the skin is soft and well-adjusted, and the pores are tight. [Note: When a person&#39;s blood, qi, and spirit are harmonized, the body rests in peace.] </p>
<p>The spleen corresponds to the flesh. If the flesh is large and firm, the stomach is thick; if the flesh is small, the stomach is thin; if the flesh is small and tender, the stomach is not firm; if the flesh does not match the body, the lower stomach is constricted and unbeneficial; if the flesh is not firm, the stomach is relaxed; if the flesh is free of small accumulations, the stomach is rapid; if the flesh has many small accumulations, the stomach is compacted, leading to constriction at the upper stomach which is unbeneficial. [Note: Ni&#39;s commentary states: (月囷) refers to fat; 么 also means small; and 约 means restriction. The stomach has upper, middle, and lower sections, thus if the lower stomach is constricted, it is unbeneficial at the lower section; if it is compacted, it is unbeneficial at the upper section.]<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>On Courage</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How do the winds of the four seasons affect the sick? Shao Yu said: Those with thin yellow skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the void winds of spring; those with thin white skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the void winds of summer; those with thin blue skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the void winds of autumn; those with thin red skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the void winds of winter. The Yellow Emperor asked: What about black? Shao Yu replied: Those with black skin that is thick and flesh that is firm are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons. However, those whose skin is thin and flesh is not firm and whose color varies will suffer from void winds as summer extends. Those with thick skin and firm muscles do not fall ill even when void winds arise during the long summer. Nevertheless, those with thick skin and firm muscles will suffer from cold if they are heavily affected by it, both inside and out, and they will become sick. 【Note: Thin skin and weak flesh indicates a deficiency in the vital energy of the organs.】<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>When the qi of the five organs is deficient, it cannot withstand the deficient winds of the four seasons. The deficient wind is the邪 wind that arises from an improper state of the vital residence. Black is the color of water, which relates to the thick or thin quality of the kidney qi. If one is not harmed by the winds of the four seasons, it indicates that the earth element is strong throughout the seasons. If one does not suffer from the winds of late summer, it signifies that the earth element dominates in late summer. Those with thick skin and firm flesh who are harmed by the winds of the four seasons must be significantly affected by cold. Heaven is represented by water on earth and by cold in the heavens; the kidneys correspond to the water organs and thus correspond to the cold air from heaven. This is why those with a black complexion and thick skin, who manifest illness, are particularly vulnerable to cold. This applies both externally and internally, as the external cold from heaven invades while internally it injures the kidney’s water qi. This illustrates the connection between a person’s five organs and the six atmospheric qi, indicating that those who are weak in the five colors cannot withstand the winds of the four seasons.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>On Pain</strong></p>
<p>People with strong bones, weak tendons, soft flesh, and thick skin can endure pain. This applies to pain from needles and stones as well as from fire. Additionally, those with black and beautiful bones can withstand the pain of fire. Those with firm flesh and thin skin cannot endure the pain from needles and stones, and this is also true regarding fire. </p>
<p>(Note: The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones of a person are nourished by the energies of both the Shaoyin and Yangming. Shaoyin possesses the essence of innate energy, while Yangming transforms the essence of food and drink. Therefore, the strength of tendons and bones, the firmness or tenderness of flesh, and the thickness or thinness of skin, as well as the openness or closeness of pores, are all influenced by the energies of Shaoyin and Yangming. Individuals with black and beautiful bones have abundant blood and energy from Shaoyin. Those with soft flesh and thick skin have abundant blood and energy from Yangming.)<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>On the Disorder of Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can one discern between the fat and the lean? Bo Gao replied: People can be fat, greasy, or meaty. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can these be differentiated? Bo Gao said: If the flesh behind the knee is firm and the skin is taut, this is fat; if the flesh is not firm and the skin is loose, this is greasy; if the skin and flesh are closely connected, this is meaty. </p>
<p>[Note: The term &quot;skin and flesh&quot; refers to the texture of the muscles, akin to how the fine meat of a pig is structured with distinct layers. The white membrane within the muscle is called fat; the fatty meat attached to the skin is referred to as fat. Thus, when the flesh behind the knee is firm and the skin taut, it denotes fat. Fat is contained within the skin, outside of the meat, and hence the flesh is firm while the skin is taut. Greasiness, on the other hand, refers to the fat substance, which entails a mixture of red and white layers akin to that of a pig. It resides between the layers of meat, which is why the meat is not firm and the skin is loose. This discourse examines the characteristics of defensive Qi in relation to fat, hence it only discusses greasiness rather than fat itself. Nonetheless, the mention of people being fat serves to clarify the distinction between greasy and fatty.]<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Those whose flesh and skin do not part are said to have flesh that overcomes and connects to the skin; they have no oil within and no fat without. This is also the superior energy of the protective qi over the flesh&#39;s channels. The Yellow Emperor asked: How does the body&#39;s coldness and warmth manifest? Bo Gao replied: The oil indicates that the flesh is tender, and coarse channels indicate a cold body; fine channels indicate a hot body. The fat indicates that the flesh is firm; fine channels indicate heat, while coarse channels indicate cold.</p>
<p>(Note: The oil signifies tender flesh, referring to the interaction and harmony between the oil and flesh. The fat represents tightly bound pores, resulting in firm flesh. Coarse channels allow the protective qi to leak outward, thus causing coldness in the body. Fine channels retain protective qi, leading to warmth in the body.) </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What about the fatness and thinness, and the sizes? Bo Gao replied: The oil indicates an abundance of qi, and the skin is loose and relaxed, allowing for a bulging and rich abdomen; the flesh indicates a larger body size; the fat indicates a smaller and more compact body.</p>
<p>(Note: When protective qi is abundant, the pores are plump. Thus, the oily nature indicates more qi and relaxed skin, allowing for a protruding and rich abdomen. The rich refers to the lower abdomen beneath the navel. The flesh indicates a larger body size due to the fullness of protective qi occupying the flesh.)<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The essence of fat is that one&#39;s body is slender because the defensive qi is profound and unable to fill the flesh, leading to a connection of fat membranes and tight muscles, hence the slender body. The Yellow Emperor said: How do the amounts of qi and blood vary among the three? Bo Gao replied: The fatty have abundant qi; abundant qi produces heat, and heat enables endurance against cold. The muscular have abundant blood; abundant blood fills the body, resulting in fullness. The fatty&#39;s blood is pure, and their qi is smooth and sparse, thus they cannot grow large; this distinguishes them from the average person. </p>
<p>The note explains that the fatty have strong defensive qi, which makes them warm and resilient to cold, while the muscular have prominent flesh, hence they possess more blood. When blood and qi are abundant, they fill the skin and heat the flesh, promoting fullness. Blood follows qi, and when both are abundant, it results in nourishment and balance. The fatty&#39;s muscles are firm and dense, leading to pure blood and lesser qi, thus they cannot grow large. These three types vary in their fatness and size, differentiating them from ordinary people. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What about ordinary people? Bo Gao replied: Ordinary people have skin, flesh, fat, and essence, which cannot be combined.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Blood and qi cannot be excessive in relation to each other; thus, their forms are neither large nor small, each claiming its own identity, called the common people. The Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should we govern this? Bo Gao said: We must first differentiate the three forms: the quantity of blood, the purity and turbidity of qi, and only then adjust them, without losing the regular principles of defense qi. Therefore, those with abundant flesh have a distended belly; the fleshy ones appear large from top to bottom, while the fatty ones cannot become large despite the fat they have. </p>
<p>(Note: Regarding the three types of people, there are excesses in being overly large or deficiently small, so it is necessary to assess the quantity of blood and the quality of qi, and then make adjustments without losing the regular principles of defense qi. This results in a harmonious individual. The loss of regular defense qi causes those with abundant flesh to have a distended belly, the fleshy ones to appear large from top to bottom, while the fatty ones cannot grow large despite having fat. Defense qi governs the area between skin, flesh, tendons, and bones, floating and sinking in various depths, each in its place. If it is solely concentrated in the space between skin and flesh, leading to a distended belly and large form, or sinking deeply into the tendons and bones so that fat cannot grow large, these are all disturbances of the defense qi. Therefore, the floating and sinking, the deep and shallow, cannot be fully exhaustively categorized; adjustments to qi are made according to changes, referred to as the superior practitioner.)</p>
<p>In the chapter on the Five Prohibitions:</p>
<p>Stagnation that does not shift, ruptured flesh, body heat, and an irregular pulse are considered adverse conditions. </p>
<p>(Note: Stagnation that does not shift, ruptured flesh, and body heat occur when dampness injures the form, leading to prolonged transformation into heat. An irregular pulse signifies the failure of the spleen and stomach qi.)<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>The True Evil of Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>The intrusion of void and evil into the body is profound; cold and heat clash, lingering long and taking root within. If cold predominates over heat, the bones ache and the flesh withers; if heat predominates over cold, the flesh rots, the muscles decay into pus, leading to internal bone injury. Internal bone injury results in bone erosion. </p>
<p>If there is an affliction in the tendons, they become bent and cannot straighten; the pathogenic energy resides within and does not retreat, causing swelling in the tendons, creating knots, and the vital energy converges, while the defending energy remains, unable to retreat. If bodily fluids linger long, they combine to form intestinal channels, and it often takes several years for this to manifest. </p>
<p>If one presses on it gently and a knot is already present, the vital energy converges, and the bodily fluids remain, while the pathogenic energy is trapped inside; as it condenses, over time it becomes more severe, congregating into what is termed a &#39;historic lump.&#39; </p>
<p>If one presses and it is firm, with a knot that penetrates deep into the bones, the energy emanates from the bones; as the bones and energy merge, it increases daily, resulting in bone abscesses. If a knot is within the flesh, the ancestral energy converges, and the evil lingers without dispersing; if there is heat, it transforms into pus, and without heat, it results in flesh abscesses.</p>
<p>All these various pathogenic energies do not emerge from fixed locations, yet they bear consistent names. <em>[Note: The clash of cold and heat refers to the yin and yang energies within the body. The essence it&#39;s about the body housing energy; when the essence is injured, the energy suffers, and vice versa. The converging of energy signifies the clashing of cold and heat, which becomes trapped within the form of evil. Thus, these various energies manifest unpredictably, yet they have established names such as flesh withering, bone erosion, tendon swelling, and historic lumps.]</em><a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</strong></p>
<p>The wind comes from the southwest, called the &quot;Strategic Wind.&quot; Its harm affects the inner spleen and manifests externally on the skin; its nature is weak. The wind comes from the southeast, known as the &quot;Weak Wind.&quot; Its harm affects the inner stomach and shows externally on the muscles; its nature is heavy.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Nine Needle Treatise</strong></p>
<p>The joy of the body leads to the joy of the heart; illness arises from the flesh, treated with needles and stones. When the body experiences shock and fear, the channels and meridians become blocked. Illness arises from lack of kindness, treated with massage and medicinal potions. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The joy of the body and heart means that when the heart is broad and the body is plump, it is necessary to treat with needles and stones to disperse qi. Shock harms the heart and liver, and fear harms the kidneys; hence, when the body experiences shock and fear, the channels and meridians become obstructed, and the nourishing qi does not flow, leading to a lack of kindness.</p>
<p><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Muscle Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>When there are three losses affecting the muscles, the muscles become thin, and food cannot nourish the skin. </p>
<p><strong>Central Storage Classics</strong> (Han: Hua Tuo)</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Muscle obstruction occurs due to irregular eating habits, the consequence of rich and fatty foods. Obstruction refers to the support of the flesh, where qi has already consumed the essence of the flesh, leading to no nourishment for the muscles, and the skin lacks moisture, resulting in loose texture. Environmental factors like wind, cold, heat, and dampness easily invade; thus, if not treated early, it leads to muscle obstruction. The condition of muscle obstruction begins with the inability to feel satisfaction despite eating. The limbs are weak and unable to hold themselves. The right pulse feels weak and lacks rhythm. One should regulate diet to balance the organs, maintain a regular routine to soothe the obstruction, and then follow the classics for supplementation and drainage to seek recovery.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Flesh Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Massaging can dispel superficial evils affecting the muscles; it is advisable to massage rather than refrain from doing so, as not massaging will lead to indulgence in the muscle, lingering for a long time without dissipating. If a disease is deficient and not supplemented, it causes the qi and blood to disperse, the muscles to weaken, the spirit to diminish, and the will to become muddled. Sweating inappropriately leads to the extinction of muscles and depletion of bodily fluids. Inappropriate massage can cause muscle swelling and relaxation of tendons and bones.<br>— <em>Qianjin Fang</em> [Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao]  </p>
<p><strong>The Extremes of Flesh</strong></p>
<p>In general, the extremes of flesh correspond to the spleen. The spleen is associated with flesh, and the flesh harmonizes with the spleen. If the spleen is diseased, the flesh changes color. Moreover, it is said: when the extreme yin encounters illness, it leads to muscular atrophy; if muscular atrophy persists and is further affected by external evils, residing within the spleen, the body itches as if mice are running, and the bodily fluids escape, the pores open, resulting in profuse sweating, with a yellowish hue at the tip of the nose which is its sign. Generally, when wind and qi accumulate in the skin, the color of the flesh deteriorates. The spleen wind occurs in the late summer when the earth element is injured by the wind. The conditions of spleen wind are characterized by excessive sweating. When yin movement is injured by cold, it leads to deficiency; deficiency results in a heavy and lethargic body, with limbs reluctant to move, lacking appetite. If food is consumed, it causes coughing; coughing then results in pain under the right ribs that radiates to the shoulder and back, restricting movement. This condition is called severe wind, with internal deficiency and external fullness.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>If yang moves and injures heat, then heat becomes real; when real, it feels as if mice are running on the body, the lips and mouth decay, the skin color changes, and bodily fluids are lost, leading to open pores and excessive sweating, which is called evil wind. One must determine its regulations, understand its beginnings and ends, and discern the dynamics of yin and yang and the fullness and emptiness of flesh. When it is full, one must drain it; when it is empty, one must replenish it. To treat the illness, if wind has just entered between the flesh, skin, and sinew, it must be dealt with immediately. If it has entered the six bowels and five organs, it is nearly fatal. Bian Que said: “Without decisive action, death will occur in five days.” How do we know this? When the skin does not open, external substances cannot be expelled. Flesh should correspond to the greater yin; if the qi of the greater yin is exhausted, the pulse will not nourish the flesh. The lips are the foundation of the flesh. If the pulse does not nourish, then the flesh weakens; if the flesh weakens, the middle of the mouth fills, and if the mouth fills, the lips will revert. If the lips revert and qi is exhausted, the flesh will perish first. A&#39;s death brings about B&#39;s demise; wood conquers earth and leads to death; without good doctors and miraculous medicines, one ultimately cannot be cured.<br>             Emptiness and Fullness.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>When the flesh is deficient, one cannot sit still; the body is unstable and restless. When the flesh is strong, one can sit comfortably and breathe easily. The response of the flesh&#39;s deficiency or fullness is governed by the spleen. If the organs are sick due to the flesh, heat will affect the organs, while cold will affect the bowels.</p>
<p>Numbness</p>
<p>When the three forces of wind, cold, and dampness linger without leaving, the limbs become numb and constricted. Dampness causes smoothness; dryness causes stagnation. Thus, because dryness and dampness oppose each other, if there is stagnation throughout the body, it belongs to the transformation of dry metal, hence numbness in autumn. However, numbness is also similar to stagnation. Due to the scarcity of water and fluids, dryness leads to numbness, and when the flow of qi is obstructed, it does not achieve smoothness and clarity. If vitality is strong but struggles violently, it results in numbness. If a healthy person suppresses their limbs, their qi will suddenly move vigorously, causing stagnation and obstruction, and numbness resembles the effect of a drum on an object. Those who do not wish to move will become numb upon movement since movement increases yang, making qi surge. Thus, numbness arises. Common prescriptions for treating numbness often use black and foxglove herbs to stimulate qi flow vigorously. This creates an opening to achieve smoothness; when the medicinal properties are exhausted, balance is restored, and qi flows freely, leading to recovery from numbness. However, the six qi do not necessarily act singularly to cause illness; they often coexist. If fluids are lost leading to dryness, or there is numbness without heat symptoms, this treatment should be considered. If wind and heat overpower dampness causing dryness and resulting in numbness, one should use herbs that expel wind, dispel heat, invigorate blood, nourish fluids, and moisten dryness to regulate and thereby resolve numbness. The treatment for all kinds of dryness and stagnation should follow this principle.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Clarity</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unkindness</strong></p>
<p>In the case of cold-induced numbness of the flesh, how can one clarify it? Kindness is softness. Unkindness is not softness; it is the inability to feel itching, pain, cold, or heat. When one allows the body to bend and stretch without awareness of these sensations, one is said to be unkind. This arises due to the excessive obstruction of pathogenic qi, causing the rightful qi to be suppressed and unable to emerge, leading to the deficiency of nutrative and defensive blood qi, thus failing to circulate properly. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when the nutrative qi is deficient, one experiences unkindness. The &quot;Needle Classic&quot; states that when the defensive qi does not circulate, it leads to unkindness. The classics say: when the nutrative and defensive forces cannot support each other, the triple burner has no elevation, and the body experiences numbness and unkindness. Therefore, it is made clear that understanding the deficiency of the nutrative and defensive blood qi, which cannot flow properly, results in unkindness. The classics state: those who succumb to the cold will suffer from obstruction and thus experience unkindness.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>This text refers to the condition known as &quot;sudden loss of consciousness&quot; caused by the invasion of cold from the environment into the body, rather than from the extremities being cold. Why is this? It is because stagnation leading to dizziness and insensitivity results in an inability to feel pain or discomfort, which can indeed be classified as a type of &quot;sudden loss of consciousness.&quot; The classic text states: when the lesser yin pulse is absent, the kidney&#39;s vitality is weak, there is a lack of essence and blood, and the rushing qi is forced upwards into the chest cavity, the ancestral qi gathers back, causing blood to stagnate beneath the heart, the yang qi retreats, heat returns to the yin, creating a mutual movement that renders the body insensitive, this is called &quot;sudden loss of consciousness.&quot; The symptoms caused by cold invasion, along with stagnation and insensitivity, clearly indicate this type of &quot;sudden loss of consciousness.&quot; In ancient times, when the people of Yue entered Guo, they diagnosed the prince&#39;s condition as &quot;sudden loss of consciousness&quot; based on stagnation and insensitivity, believing it to be treatable, and they performed acupuncture, resulting in a cure; this truly reflects the skill of a divine healer. Oh! If someone has a pulse that is floating and surging, sweats profusely, experiences continuous shortness of breath, cannot take in liquids, and their body is insensitive, this is called life-threatening, and even the people of Yue would find it difficult to revive such a person.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Trembling</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: When the qi moves to the left, sweating should not be induced; if sweating occurs, it leads to dizziness and if the sweat does not stop, the muscles and flesh tremble. This occurs when sweating stimulates the liver qi. How can we clarify the muscle trembling in the case of cold damage? Cold damage typically presents with headaches, body aches, aversion to cold, and fever—these are inevitable signs. The muscle trembling is usually caused by excessive sweating; when yang is lost, it manifests. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Yang qi nourishes the spirit when it is refined and nourishes the muscles when it is gentle. Excessive sweating leads to depletion of fluids and weakened yang qi, causing the muscles to lose their nourishment, which results in trembling and involuntary movements. In cases of taiyang disease where the pulse is weak and sweating occurs with aversion to wind, one should not take the major green dragon decoction; taking it would lead to counterflow and muscular trembling, marking a reversal.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>In cases of Taiyang disease, if sweating is induced and the sweat does not resolve the fever, but the person continues to have fever, with dizziness and body trembling, and a sensation of wanting to hit the ground, this is treated with Zhenwu Decoction. If the movement of qi is on the left, sweating should not be induced; if it is induced, it will lead to dizziness, unceasing sweat, and trembling of the tendons and flesh. This indicates that the excessive sweating has consumed Yang, revealing Yang deficiency. Though this may seem contrary, it is necessary to stop the sweating that depletes Yang and leads to exterior deficiency, and treat with warming the meridians and nourishing Yang. If someone has symptoms of deficiency at both the exterior and interior due to vomiting, purging, and sweating, this is not the same as just the aftermath of sweating alone. The classics say: in cases of cold damage with vomiting, purging, and sweating, if there is vexation and the pulse is very weak, after eight or nine days there may be distention below the heart, pain in the sides, qi surging to the throat, dizziness, and movement of the tendons, which can lead to atrophy over time. This indicates a severe reversal. After sweating, vomiting, and purging in a case of Taiyang disease, if both the exterior and interior are deficient, and there are additional symptoms like chest distress, and a blue-yellow complexion with trembling skin, treatment is difficult. This is the gravest reversal. Sweating, vomiting, and purging should not be neglected!</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of unfeelingness:</p>
<p>If the flesh is unfeeling, it is due to a combination of wind, dampness, and cold leading to obstruction, along with numbness in the hands and feet. The Neijing states: with deficient nourishment and replete defenses, the skin is unfeeling and cannot sense itch or pain. One may use Yujin Powder for vomiting, and then take Daoshui Pill and lighter cold medications to purge; once purged, follow with spicy warming agents. After sweating, regularly taking medicines such as angelica, peony, rehmannia, and prepared aconite to harmonize the blood will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Eastern Garden Ten Treatises</strong><br><strong>(Yuan - Li Gao)</strong>  </p>

If there is deficiency accompanied by dampness, one experiences numbness alongside other symptoms. In cases where deficiency is compounded by the three factors of wind, cold, and damp, the whole body may experience pulling pain and numbness. In severe cases, one should expel the excess through sweating before supplementing. If phlegm stagnates in the limbs or if just one finger becomes numb for over a year, it may indicate a risk of stroke; these are all signs of prior qi and blood deficiency. Such conditions must be treated in advance.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Medical Transmission - Ming Dynasty, Yu Tuan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The three energies of wind, cold, and dampness combine to create blockages. Hence, when wind prevails, it causes moving blockages; when cold prevails, it causes painful blockages; and when dampness prevails, it causes stagnation. He Jian states: If it lingers and does not go away, the limbs become numb and constrained. It further states: When there is pain, it is due to excessive cold; pain arises from cold. When there is no pain or numbness, it indicates a prolonged illness that has penetrated deeply. The flow of nourishment is sluggish, and the meridians are sometimes obstructed, thus there is no pain; the skin is not nourished, resulting in numbness. The so-called numbness can affect the entire body or just the limbs, leading to a tingling, numbing sensation without awareness of pain or itch, similar to the state after a rope has been released from tight binding. The ancient texts referred to this as numbness. Danxi mentions: Numbness relates to Qi deficiency, while &#39;wood&#39; symbolizes dampness, phlegm, and stagnant blood. Therefore, referring to numbness and &#39;wood&#39; is a way of distinguishing two kinds of numbness. Nonetheless, there can be cases of both Qi and blood deficiency that present only numbness without &#39;wood&#39;; there are also cases where deficiency causes dampness, leading to both numbness and pain; further, there can be conditions where deficiency allows the three energies of wind, cold, and dampness to invade, resulting in pain and numbness throughout the body. Ancient texts termed this as generalized blockage. The treatment method should prioritize sweating first, followed by supplementation. Physicians should apply similar principles to treat, rather than adhering to a single viewpoint.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>A floating and moist pulse indicates Qi deficiency. If it is felt in the front gate, the condition affects the upper body; if felt in the back gate, it affects the lower body. A floating and relaxed pulse indicates dampness, leading to paralysis; a tight and floating pulse indicates cold, leading to painful obstruction; a choppy and hollow pulse indicates stagnant blood, belonging to Wood, with no sensation of pain or itch.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Functions</strong></p>
<p>The spleen governs muscle. The classic states: the spleen governs muscle; in the body it is the muscle, in the organs it is the spleen. Moreover, if there is evil in the spleen and stomach, muscle pain will result. Spleen illness is located in the creek. The classic states: in the northern direction, black corresponds with the kidneys, hence illness in the creek. The creek is the minor convergence of muscle.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>Dampness injures the muscles, sweetness harms the muscles. The classic states: dampness injures the muscles, wind overcomes dampness. Sweetness harms the muscles, sourness overcomes sweetness. Furthermore, excessive sweetness leads to muscle diseases; consuming a lot of sourness causes muscular stiffness and lip peeling. Prolonged sitting injures the muscles. The classic states: prolonged sitting damages muscles. Moreover, emotional joy and physical delight can lead to ailments in the muscles, which should be treated with needles and stones.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Death from Flesh Loss</strong></p>
<p>When the flesh has fully detached, despite the nine conditions being regulated, it is still like this. Qi Bo desires that one understands the pulse aligned with the form. The flesh is governed by the spleen, which is the source of all things. Observing the flesh&#39;s detachment indicates internal damage to the spleen, leading to a loss of foundation. Even if the nine conditions are adjusted, one cannot escape death; how can the form be overlooked?</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>The scripture states: When spleen qi is hot, the stomach dries and thirst arises, causing the muscles to become numb, leading to muscle atrophy. The atrophy of the spleen results in muscle atrophy. The spleen and stomach are interconnected by membranes, opening at the mouth. Therefore, if spleen heat occurs, the stomach dries and causes thirst. The spleen governs muscles; internal heat depletes vital essence, resulting in numb muscles, leading to muscle atrophy.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Obstruction diseases affecting the muscles often lead to numbness, corresponding to the spleen. The symptoms include weakness in the limbs, coughing, and vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong></p>
<p>Muscle numbness occurs due to wind, dampness, and heat descending into the blood division&#39;s yin. The yang pathway is obstructed, and there may also be phlegm in the blood division. Symptoms include general muscle numbness and itching when closing one&#39;s eyes, as blood fails to nourish the skin and muscles. Treatments with ginseng and astragalus can help the yang pathway, while angelica can promote the yin pathway. The herbs Atractylodes, Poria, licorice, and rhubarb can eliminate damp heat, and schisandra, perilla, and peony can uplift the condition. Phlegm requires treatment with Er Chen. Treatment should be effective; if encountering wind and dampness, the arms may feel painful or numb, or the entire body may experience muscle numbness. Use Wu Ji San for this.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Medicine: Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Spleen Corresponds to Flesh</strong><br>If there is deficiency in any of the five organs, it will manifest externally. When the spleen is deficient, the face and limbs will exhibit weak and swollen muscles. One should channel the flow and replenish the source, which can be considered a skillful approach.</p>
<p><strong>Emaciation</strong><br>When the heart and spleen are compromised, leading to stomach damage, food does not nourish the skin and flesh. It is advisable to tonify qi and harmonize blood with appropriate diet, remedies like the Ten Benefits Great Tonifying Decoction, and Kidney-strengthening Pills.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Flesh</strong><br>When the spleen is full, it leads to muscular obstruction, the pores open, resulting in profuse sweating and weak limbs with urgent pain. One should take Job’s Tears Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong><br>When the nutrients and defenses stagnate and do not circulate, numbness occurs, similar to prolonged pressure on one area, causing inability to lift—this can be understood. Numbness is related to phlegm and deficiency; wood corresponds entirely to damp phlegm and stagnant blood, which causes insensitivity to pain or itch, leading to a state of numbness. Those with a deep, slippery pulse and a robust body are often afflicted with phlegm and dampness. Using the combinations of the two herbs of Atractylodes and Pinellia, along with possibly a few additional herbs for wind like Qiang, Duan, and Cinnamon Twig, while also incorporating Ginseng and Astragalus for qi replenishment, is beneficial.<br>For women and those with a history of repression, it is essential to clear the stagnation.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The pulse is weak or feels large and powerless; for those who have been ill for a long time and are emaciated, the blood and qi are deficient, so one should tonify the middle and benefit the qi. Alternatively, add a piece of processed aconite and use Sheng Mai San in summer. </p>
<p>If one feels no pain or discomfort but experiences increased coldness, with symptoms that are lighter during the day and heavier at night, the pulse will be weak and hollow. </p>
<p>Phlegm mixed with stagnant blood should be treated with blood-activating and qi-moving herbs, such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, peach kernel mud, safflower, Notopterygium, and the two Chen herbs, combined with chives. For dark stools and constipation, use Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction to relieve it.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage, one may experience tremors, which are not uncommon. Yang qi, when adequate, nourishes the spirit and when gentle, nourishes the tendons. Excessive sweating leads to depletion of fluids, and when yang qi is deficient, the muscles and tendons lose nourishment, causing tremors and spasms. Without warming the channels and assisting yang with medicine, how can one expect improvement? Therefore, Shen Wu Decoction is prescribed to rescue this condition. After sweating, vomiting, or purging, when both exterior and interior are deficient, these symptoms are especially serious.</p>
<p>Numbness of the muscles refers to a lack of softness and sensitivity; even with pain or itching, one remains unaware, unable to feel needles or fire applied to the skin. When various deficiencies coincide with cold, this results in malaise and numbness. If blood and qi are weak and cannot circulate throughout the body, upright qi is suppressed by evil qi, which leads to limbs being stubbornly numb and lifeless as if they were dead. Use a decoction of equal parts cinnamon and麻 also. If this does not resolve the issue, then use the Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction with ginger juice. </p>
<p>If the body feels oily, sweating does not cease, breathing is labored, and one cannot take in water, this indicates a critical condition.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Numbness</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Neijing,&quot; it states that the combination of the three Qi: wind, cold, and dampness results in bi syndrome. When wind predominates, it is termed &quot;xingshi,&quot; when cold predominates, it is &quot;tongbi,&quot; and when dampness predominates, it is &quot;zhangbi.&quot; The state of being neither painful nor sensitive is called numbness. Currently, the symptom of numbness aligns with the classic definition of being neither painful nor sensitive. When an illness has persisted for a long time, it penetrates deeply, causing the flow of nourishment and defense to become sluggish, leading to the obstruction of meridians, hence the absence of pain; the skin lacks nourishment, resulting in insensitivity, much like the condition of a rope that has been tied and then partially loosened.</p>
<p><strong>To treat numbness, the first step is to disperse and guide the Qi and blood that are stagnant.</strong></p>
<p>If one sits or lies in a position for an extended time, causing the Qi and blood in the meridians to become unimpeded, numbness will result, indicating stagnation. Numbness predominantly occurs in the limbs and the fingers, suggesting inadequate Qi and blood supply to the extremities, resulting in numbness. Danxi asserts the frequent use of aconite to move the meridians, which aligns with this idea. </p>
<p>For numbness in all ten fingers, this indicates a significant presence of damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach, for which the prescription of Er Chen Decoction with the addition of Atractylodes Macrocephala, Peach Kernel, and Red Flower is recommended.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The &quot;Original Disease Theory&quot; lists the symptoms of numbness under the categories of the Six Qis, including Dryness and Metal. It explains that when substances gain moisture, they become smooth and moist; when they are dry, they become stagnant. Numbness is akin to stagnation. This results from a deficiency of bodily fluids leading to dryness, and from the obstruction of Qi, which prevents smooth circulation. If Qi becomes strong and forceful, it can create numbness.</p>
<p>Common remedies for numbness often include the use of black and aconite herbs, which stimulate Qi excessively, thus helping to resolve the stagnation and restore smooth circulation, resulting in the alleviation of numbness. However, the Six Qis do not necessarily imply that any single Qi alone causes disease; multiple Qis can interact. If bodily fluids are lost, leading to dryness, or if there is numbness without heat symptoms, then this must be treated accordingly. If wind-heat overwhelms dampness and leads to numbness, one should use cooling herbs to dispel wind, scatter heat, invigorate blood, nourish fluids, and moisten dryness to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>Dongyuan states that numbness signifies a deficiency of Qi. When the vital energy is weak and cannot flow properly, it blocks the meridians, resulting in weakness in the limbs and subsequent numbness. This numbness may occur in the hands or feet, or it may affect the skin overall. Remedies should include Astragalus, Ginseng, Atractylodes, Licorice, Schisandra, Peony, Angelica, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, tailored according to the seasonal Qi without rigid prescription, focusing solely on tonifying the deficiency without harshly attacking or forcing the Qi.</p>
<p>I have noted that both Liu and Li lived in the same era and place, without differences in worldly conditions or geographical suitability. Why then is there such a distinction between their approaches to treatment? This is due to their different understandings of the Way of the Sages. Liu believed that a person is born with innate gifts, and when disturbances from pathogens enter and disrupt the Qi, illness results. Therefore, attacking the pathogen is essential; once the pathogen is expelled, the vital energy can restore its balance.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Using the true qi of a person nourishes the hundred bones and circulates throughout life. Whenever the true qi is out of balance and suffers even a little, the five evils and six afflictions can take the opportunity to invade. Therefore, the key is to supplement and correct; when the correct qi is restored, the evil qi will naturally retreat. Now, it is advisable to carefully consider the methods of the two gentlemen, to know when to attack and when to supplement, and adjust accordingly without being rigid in their theories. Danxi further divides numbness into two types; one type called &quot;ma&quot; merely stops habits and still shows no signs of the disturbance of qi and blood, while &quot;wood&quot; indicates that qi and blood have been obstructed and are unresponsive, lacking awareness of pain and itching. When an epidemic wind first arises, the hands and feet will certainly first show signs of &quot;wood&quot; and then the skin will ulcerate; similarly, in cases of boils and paralysis, the hands and feet can also become numb. One should seek the origins of this. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: when the nourishing qi is weak, there is no responsiveness; when the defensive qi is weak, there is no function; when both the nourishing and defensive qi are weak, there is neither responsiveness nor function. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: if the defensive qi does not flow, then one is bound to experience numbness.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>In Dongyuan&#39;s treatment of paralysis, it is essential to supplement the defensive Qi and proceed accordingly; this serves as the fundamental approach. </p>
<p>For generalized numbness and loss of sensation, whether on the left or right side of the body, or affecting the face, head, arms, or legs, the Huangqi Decoction is effective. </p>
<p>If the skin feels numb, it indicates that the lung Qi is not circulating; thus, the Shaoyao Qi Decoction should be used. If the muscles are numb, one must clear the nutrients to recover. If damp heat is present, causing heaviness and pain in the limbs, one should expel the dampness and heat. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; if blood deficiency presents with both Yin and Yang being weak, the pulse at the cun position is faint, and the pulse at the chi position is mildly tight, while external signs show numbness resembling wind blockage, the Huangqi and Guizhi Five Ingredients Decoction should be prescribed. </p>
<p>If damp wind symptoms persist with dizziness and ongoing numbness, the Qianghuo Decoction for expelling wind and dampness should be used. </p>
<p>For deficiency of nourishment and protective Qi resulting in muscle numbness leading to heaviness, termed &quot;meat hardness,&quot; the Qianhu Powder or Ku Shen Pills are recommended.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Classical and Modern Books, Medical Section, Volume 213</strong></p>

<p>According to the &quot;Su Wen,&quot; when the moon begins to wax, the blood and qi energies start to accumulate, and the defensive qi begins to circulate; when the moon is full, the blood is abundant, and the muscles are firm; when the moon wanes, the muscles diminish, the meridians weaken, and the defensive qi disperses, leaving the body alone. Thus, blood and qi should be adjusted in accordance with the seasons. During cold weather, acupuncture should not pierce, during warm weather, should not congeal; in the waxing moon, there should be no purging; in the full moon, there should be no tonics; in the waning moon, there should be no treatments—this is called treating it in accordance with time.<br>Conditions based on the sequence of nature, during times of abundance and deficiency, light should be moved to adjust positioning, standing upright and waiting for the right moment.  </p>
<p>For diseases of the skin, needling the skin should not injure the flesh; if the flesh is hurt, it causes internal disturbance to the spleen. If the spleen is disturbed, it leads to abdominal distension and loss of appetite, with symptoms lasting for seventy-two days across the seasons.<br>Needling the skin without harming the flesh indicates that the disease is within the skin; a needle inserted into the skin does not injure the flesh.<br>The Yellow Emperor asked: Can the dimensions of the meridians, the amount of blood, the thickness of the skin, the firmness of the flesh, and the size of the knees be measured? Qibo replied: What can be measured is the average; it should not excessively deplete the flesh while ensuring the blood and qi do not diminish.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>As for those who measure the body, if they are thin and emaciated, how can they accurately assess and needling them? By carefully examining and palpating, observing their seasonal changes in temperature and vitality, one adjusts accordingly; this is called acting in accordance with the true nature of things.</p>
<p>In spring, one targets the collaterals; in summer, the fascial layers; in autumn, the orifices of qi; in winter, the channels and collaterals. Each of these four seasons is treated according to its own timing. The collaterals address the skin, the fascial layers treat the muscles, the orifices of qi affect the tendons, and the channels and collaterals address the bones and marrow.</p>
<p>In spring, needling the collaterals causes the blood and qi to overflow outward, leading to diminished breath. Needling the muscles in spring causes blood and qi to flow in reverse, leading to shortness of breath. Needling the tendons and bones in spring causes blood and qi to stagnate inward, resulting in abdominal distension.</p>
<p>In summer, needling the channels causes the blood and qi to become depleted, leading to disorientation. Needling the muscles in summer causes the blood and qi to retreat inward, resulting in anxiety. Needling the tendons and bones in summer leads to the upward reversal of blood and qi, causing anger.</p>
<p>In winter, needling the channels causes the blood and qi to completely escape, leading to unclear vision. Needling the collaterals in winter causes internal qi to leak outward, resulting in great pain. Needling the muscles in winter leads to the depletion of yang qi, causing forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: When illness is located between the muscle layers, use a round needle at the site of the illness. </p>
<p>The method of the three needlings to release the sourness involves first shallowly needling to break the skin to expel yang pathogens, and then deeper needling to expel the yin pathogens by penetrating further into the muscle, without yet entering the space between the muscle layers. Once penetrating into the space between the muscle layers, then the sourness is released.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The meridian point He Gu is pricked, with needles placed between the muscle divisions on both sides, to relieve muscle stiffness, which corresponds to the spleen. Spring energy resides in the hair, summer energy in the skin, autumn energy in the muscle divisions, and winter energy in the tendons and bones. When treating these ailments, one must align with the appropriate seasonal energy. Therefore, for the obese, treatment should align with autumn and winter; for the lean, it should align with spring and summer.</p>
<p>If the pathogenic factors are in the spleen and stomach, muscle pain will result. When yang energy is excessive and yin energy is insufficient, there will be heat accompanied by hunger. Conversely, when yang energy is lacking and yin energy is excessive, there will be cold, intestinal sounds, and abdominal pain. If both yin and yang energies are excessive or deficient, there will be both cold and heat, which can be balanced at the San Li point.</p>
<p>For muscle pain marked by cold and heat, with hair damaged and lips dry, unable to sweat, one should tonify the three yang channels below to expel blood and supplement the taiyin to promote sweating. </p>
<p>Wind, cold, and dampness invading the exterior muscle divisions lead to urgency and particular symptoms. When dampness encounters cold, it accumulates; and when it accumulates, it disrupts the muscle divisions, causing splitting. When splitting occurs, pain arises, and when the spirit returns, there is heat; the heat alleviates the pain, which in turn leads to numbness, causing further issues which manifest in the same way.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one know the diseases of flesh? Bo Gao replied: The colors of the lips—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—indicate disease in the muscles. There is a structure within the flesh; this structure lies between the muscles of the arms and legs in the yang parts, and near the yin regions of the feet. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can it be treated? Bo Gao said: The myriad diseases are changeable, arising and subsiding, and are too numerous to exhaust; each has its place. Those in the superficial layer are less severe, while the deeper ones are more troublesome; the mild ones are few, while the severe ones are many. Adjust the qi according to the changes. Hence it is said: That which responds to the earth in humans is the flesh; therefore, when treating with needles, one must ensure that the body is tubular and the ends are rounded, so as to avoid injuring the flesh. If injured, the qi will be depleted.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Classic&quot; states: Coughing, shortness of breath, sudden loss of voice, and a blue vein beneath the tongue; with a large atmosphere around the neck, a dry and urgent throat that cannot breathe, a sound from the throat, alternating chills and fevers, swollen neck and shoulder pain, fullness in the chest, hot skin on the abdomen, malaria, shortness of breath, heart pain, rashes, headaches, red and hot facial skin, and a loss of sensitivity in the body—these indicate the primary aspects.</p>
<p>Cold qi in the interstitial spaces of the muscles causes pain and numbness in both the upper and lower parts, which is managed by the Zhongdu. The &quot;Medical Principles&quot; states: All who suffer in summer from wind, cold, and dampness, resulting in muscle obstruction, if prolonged, will affect the spleen, resulting in weakness in the four limbs, causing coughing and vomiting of fluids; remedies include Tai Bai and San Li.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rite of Filial Piety&quot; states: A man from Yancheng named Liang, over sixty years old, suddenly woke up one morning to comb his hair and noticed that the fingers of his left hand were numb. In a little while, half of his arm became numb, then the other arm followed. Soon, half of his head was numb, and by the time he finished combing, he experienced numbness from his waist down to his feet. He had not had a bowel movement for two to three days. He sought the advice of doctors, who all said it was due to wind. Some prescribed medicine, others acupuncture, but nothing worked. Eventually, he sought treatment from Doctor Dai. </p>
<p>Doctor Dai observed that all three pulse positions on the left hand were weak and three times smaller than those on the right hand, indicating a condition of deficiency and stagnation. It could not solely be attributed to wind; there was also accompanying dryness from heat. He prescribed a treatment involving one purge, one diuretic, and one sweating method, and the numbness immediately subsided. Afterwards, he balanced the condition with warming herbs and moistening draughts, but the little and ring fingers still showed some numbness. </p>
<p>Doctor Dai commented that the root of the illness had been eradicated and that this remaining sensation was just residual heat, which could be treated with acupuncture at the gu (valley) point. The gu point is where the bone is hollow. On a sunny day, he performed the acupuncture, using the technique from the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; that involves the chicken foot method. He inserted needles vertically while lying on his back, advancing and retracting them three times, then removed the needles and inserted them again while lying on his stomach, applying them to the spaces between the fingers. Afterward, the hand felt hot like fire, and all numbness had ceased. In the past, Liu Hejian wrote the &quot;Original Pathologies,&quot; often attributing numbness to dryness, thus understanding the mechanism of diseases truly well.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The &quot;Treasures of Health&quot; states: When Zhang Fuchu was ill, he experienced pain in his right shoulder and arm that could not be controlled. He was unable to move, sweated excessively, the muscles were emaciated, and he could not lie down properly as it caused more pain. The classic states: Excessive sweating leads to weakness, causing a person to become emaciated. I reflect on the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which says that deficiency and excess are neighbors, and one can resolve and connect them. It also states: If one remains emaciated and stagnant, one must use acupuncture and moxibustion to unblock and harmonize the meridians, allowing blood and energy to recover. It mentions that if there is sinking energy, moxibustion should be applied, as vital energy has descended into the Yin. When the shoulder pains intermittently and cannot move, one should guide it with fire; fire leads upwards, thus replenishing and warming. All these symptoms are suitable for acupuncture and moxibustion. It is said that one should first puncture the Jing points of the twelve meridians. On April 12, I first needled the Jianjing point on the upper shoulder of the right arm, then applied moxibustion for fifteen sessions, whereupon sore areas began to emerge, and gradually muscle was added to the lean areas, sweating decreased, and the shoulder and arm regained some strength. By May 8, I applied moxibustion again at Jianjing and then at the Chize point, each for twenty-eight sessions, directing energy downward to connect with the righteous energy. The next day, the arm again gained strength and could move. It was mid-summer, with increasing heat, so I prescribed Qingfei Yin to tonify lung energy, nourish the spleen and stomach, and calm the heart.</p>
<p>In &quot;Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Records,&quot; it is stated: A parturient woman experienced numbness in both hands. After taking Yufeng Dan and Tianma Pills, she felt numbness all over the body, was lethargic, thirsty during the evening, and experienced spontaneous sweating and night sweats. I prescribed several doses of Shenqi Dabu Decoction, after which all symptoms receded. After a few more doses, she recovered completely. However, because of internal heat, I used Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder for her cure.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>A woman initially suffered from a deficiency of vital energy. When fatigued, her body became numb and warm, with phlegm and qi rising to attack. She was treated with remedies like Wuyao Shunqi Powder and Qufeng Huatan Pill. Her limbs were weak and her phlegm and saliva were spontaneously expelled. She had a sallow complexion and felt fatigued, with her spleen and lungs notably weak, indicating deficiency resembling wind. She improved gradually with the morning use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and evening use of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. Eventually, she was treated with a modified Gui Pi Decoction and recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng&quot; states: Mrs. Li Zhengchen was diagnosed with a pulse that was thin and taut, both full and slow, with no strength upon palpation. The tautness was at the superficial level, indicating wind-heat sinking into the yin, obstructing the yang path. Her symptoms included complete body numbness with closed eyes, which was less severe in the daytime and worse at night; upon awakening and opening her eyes, the numbness gradually receded, and if prolonged, it would stop. She kept her eyes open due to fear of numbness, causing insomnia. Her body felt heavy, with occasional phlegmatic cough, a constant sensation of phlegm in her chest that was not easily expelled, and intermittent agitation with shortness of breath and wheezing. Her skin appeared swollen, but her appetite and bowel movements were normal. The greatest suffering was the fear of numbness and the inability to close her eyes. Observing her color and pulse, her symptoms matched the state of her illness without contradiction. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In yang conditions, opening the eyes and moving is light; in yin conditions, closing the eyes and resting is heavy. It further states: All pulses are related to the eyes.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The “Lingshu” states: When the eyes are opened, the yang pathway operates, and the yang energy spreads throughout the body; when the eyes are closed, the yang pathway is blocked and does not operate. This is like the division between day and night, understanding that the yang declines while the yin flourishes. Furthermore, numbness is caused by wind; even a three-foot-tall child understands this, but upon closer examination, it is not true. For instance, one becomes numb after sitting for a long time. If a person is tightly bound by a rope, once released, they may feel numb but dare not move; after a while, they adapt. Observing this, it is clear that it is not an invasion of wind, but rather that the energy is stagnant. There is no need to treat for wind; one should tonify the lung&#39;s energy, and then the numbness will dissipate. Understanding that the yin fire within the meridians affects the yang aspect, with internal movement causing numbness, one should also eliminate the yin fire to achieve recovery. When there is phlegm and coughing, it is due to the coolness of autumn on the outside and dampness causing discomfort. One should warm the skin with warming medicinals. When the body feels heavy and the pulse is slow, it indicates trapped dampness. When an anxious sensation appears, one should raise the yang, support the qi, and enrich the blood, subtly drain the yin fire and eliminate dampness, allowing the meridians to flow and balancing the yin and yang. It does not signify an innate evil in the five organs and six bowels. The remedy is to supplement qi, elevate yang, and harmonize.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>During the severe winter frost, Lady Li fell ill, with her limbs weak and paralyzed, indicating damp heat in the lower body. The bitter heart indicates that the turbid qi does not descend and is accumulating. If the eyes are numb when closed, it signifies that the yang pathways are not functioning. If the eyes are not numb when open, it indicates that the opening of the eyes aids the yang pathways, thus slightly alleviating the cold qi. Dizziness and spinning in the head indicate that the wind qi has sunk into the blood aspect, and it arises without stretching out. The &quot;Warming the Meridians and Eliminating Dampness Decoction&quot; is prescribed for this condition.</p>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Dali, Han Zhuquan, experienced complete paralysis and could not move, seeking treatment from me. I provided him with a modified version of the &quot;Miraculous Efficacy Astragalus Decoction,&quot; using one liang and two qian of astragalus, and six qian each of ginseng and peony. The rest of the ingredients were similar, and one dose was reduced by half. He wanted immediate results, so he combined two doses into one, and within ten days, his illness seemed to vanish. I advised him that with his original qi beginning to recover, he should rest to nourish it, and only after it became solid should he go out. He could not follow this advice and suddenly went out during the heat of summer, attending to guests and becoming fatigued over several days. One day, while exiting the morning chamber and mounting a horse, he unexpectedly nearly fell over. Companions assisted him to the guesthouse and invited me to examine him, but I declined treatment. A few days later, he passed away.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The Meat Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Manifestations of the Six Organs</strong></p>
<p>The spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, sanjiao (triple burner), and bladder are the foundation of storage; they house nourishment and are collectively referred to as “the器” (vessel). These organs transform the impure into essence, varying flavors as they intake and expel. Its manifestation is seen in the four white areas of the lips, its fullness resides in the flesh; its flavor is sweet, and its color is yellow. This represents the extreme yin, which corresponds to the earth&#39;s energy. </p>
<p>[Note: The foot of the Greater Yin receives the impurity of food and drink, serving as the conduit for transportation. The intestines and stomach lead in receiving and transmitting food and drink, the sanjiao governs the regulation of water pathways, while the bladder is the reservoir for water essence; thus, they are all fundamental to storage. The spleen houses nourishment, hence it is the dwelling for nourishment. The term &quot;器&quot; denotes the universe of generation and transformation, capable of rising, descending, entering, and exiting. The spleen can process the impure and transform flavors that nourish the five organs, while expelling waste through the two yin organs; hence it is called a vessel. The &quot;four whites&quot; refer to the white flesh surrounding the four corners of the lips. The mouth serves as an orifice of the spleen and governs the flesh, hence its manifestation appears at the four white areas of the lips, its fullness exists in the flesh. Sweetness corresponds to the flavor of earth, and yellow represents its color. The spleen is the utmost yin within yin, corresponding to the earth&#39;s energy. This section refers specifically to the spleen, while the intestines, stomach, sanjiao, and bladder engage in receiving and transmitting both the essence and residue of food and drink, thus being collectively called the foundation of storage. The receiver of impurities is defined as yin; hence it is referred to as the extreme yin.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Chapter on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The spleen is associated with flesh; its manifestation is in the lips, and it is governed by the liver. [Note: The spleen governs the central earth and is in charge of the granaries, responsible for processing and transforming the essences of food and water to nourish the muscles and flesh, hence its association with meat. The spleen opens at the mouth, which is why its manifestation is in the lips. The spleen is earth and is constrained by the liver&#39;s wood; thus, the liver is the main organ generating the spleen.] Eating too much sour food leads to the flesh becoming rigid and the lips becoming curled, as this hurts the five flavors. [Note: Consuming too much sour food represents an excess of the wood flavor, which damages the spleen, causing the flesh to become rigid and the lips to curl. The five flavors are meant to nourish the five organs; if one organ becomes excessive, the organ that it is incompatible with will be harmed; this illustrates the principle that constraints should not be exceeded.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Reversal and Regulation</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: For a person whose flesh is harsh, even when near soft clothing, it still feels harsh. What illness does this signify? Qi Bo replied: The nourishing qi is weak, while the protective qi is strong. When the nourishing qi is weak, insensitivity arises; when the protective qi is strong, it cannot be used. If both the nourishing and defensive energies are weak, it results in insensitivity and ineffectiveness, leaving the flesh unchanged.<br><em>Note: &quot;Harsh&quot; means cruel. Even when flesh is close to soft clothing, it still feels cruel. Weakness and strength indicate imbalance. The nourishing qi cannot harmonize with the protective qi, leading to the weakness of the nourishing qi and the strength of the protective qi. The path of yang is always strong, hence it is called strong. Thus, excess is as bad as deficiency. Insensitivity is the inability to feel pain or itch, while ineffectiveness means weakness and an inability to function. The phrase indicates the disharmony between nourishing and protective energies, both being weak. When both energies are weak, there is insensitivity and ineffectiveness, and insensitivity and ineffectiveness with unchanged harshness of flesh indicate a lack of harmony, resulting in weakness.</em><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of Qi and Cavities</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear about the convergence in the valleys. Qi Bo replied: The major convergence of flesh is in the valley, while the minor convergence is in the creek. Between the divisions of flesh, the convergence of creeks and valleys enables the flow of nourishment and defense, congregating great qi. If evil qi overflows and obstructs, causing the pulse to heat and the flesh to decay, and if nourishment and defense do not circulate, it will inevitably lead to pus. If internal consumption affects the bone marrow and externally it damages the major joints, and if it lingers at the joints, it will certainly lead to failure. Accumulation of cold lingers and the nourishment and defense do not reside, causing the flesh to shrink and muscles to contract, resulting in inability to extend the ribs and elbows; internally this leads to bone numbness, and externally to lack of sensation, termed insufficiency; this is the great cold residing in the valleys. The creeks and valleys gather three hundred sixty-five cavities, corresponding to the year. Minor numbness and overflow travel along the pulse; where fine needles reach, it aligns with the principle. </p>
<p><em>Note: The flesh has major divisions, like the meat of the thigh and arm, each with its own boundaries; minor divisions refer to the inner muscle tissue, which also has patterns and lines. Despite the division, they interconnect, thus the major division is the major convergence, and the minor division is the minor convergence. Between the divisions, the flow of the nourishment and defense qi gives the name &#39;creek and valley.&#39; Great qi refers to ancestral qi. Qi is yang; if evil remains in the superficial layers of the flesh, when evil and righteousness clash, it results in pathogenic heat, hence the diseases manifest as pus and decay.</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When evil qi overflows, the righteous qi becomes obstructed. The energy of the streams and valleys connects with the meridians; thus, when the pulse is hot inside, the flesh decays outside. If the flow of nourishment and defense is impaired, then blood and qi stagnate and become obstructed. If pus and evil stagnate between the joints and flesh, then the tendons and bones will surely deteriorate. The accumulation of cold leads to the inability of nourishment and defense to reside within, causing the cold evil to stagnate and not be harmonized by righteous qi, resulting in the flesh curling and the tendons contracting. The ribs and elbows serve as the joints of the tendons and bones, hence they cannot stretch or relax. Evil is obstructed outside, causing internal bone blockages. When the nourishment and defense rebel inward, this results in outward numbness, termed insufficiency. The overflow of heat evil signifies excess, while the nature of cold is stagnation, hence leading to insufficiency. This great cold evil lingers between the streams and valleys, causing illness to the tendons and bones. Within the streams and valleys, there are also three hundred sixty-five points corresponding to a year, akin to the pathways of the sun. These can be pierced with fine needles to expel the evil. Minor blockages refer to the initial invasion of evil into the skin, without harming the tendons and bones. The meridian referred to is the sun pathway. When the evil resides in the skin and travels along the meridian, treating it with expulsion is similar to the method for the sun pathway, and it is not necessary to inquire about the specific points. This speaks to how evil initially invades a person; it starts with the skin, then the sun pathway, enters the muscles, and affects the tendons and bones. When it is still shallow, fine needles can easily disperse it, preventing it from penetrating deeply and causing major blockage.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Longevity and Short Life</strong></p>
<p>Bojiao said: When the body and Qi are in harmony, one attains longevity; when they are not in harmony, one meets with early death. If the body is full and large, and the flesh is firm and well-defined, then the flesh is strong, leading to longevity. If the body is full and large, but the flesh lacks definition and is not firm, then the flesh is fragile, resulting in early death. <strong>[Note: The spleen governs the earth and is responsible for flesh.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Qi of the Foot Taiyin originates in the spleen. The spleen stores nourishment and externally governs the muscles. Thus, when the Qi of the Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse does not nourish the muscles. The spleen opens to the mouth, governing the welcoming of food, which is why the lips and tongue are the foundation of the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish, the muscles wither and the lips invert, indicating the external exhaustion of the Taiyin&#39;s vital Qi. The essence of one dies, and the essence of the other dies, indicating the internal death of the spleen’s Qi.</p>

<p>In hot weather, if one wears thick clothing, the pores open, thus causing sweating; if cold lingers between the flesh layers, it gathers and causes pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pores refer to the texture and structure between the flesh layers. Fluids follow the Triple Burner to exit, pooling between the skin and muscles. Therefore, when the pores are open, sweat is released abundantly. If there is cold that lingers and gathers between the flesh layers, it splits the flesh and causes pain.

<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we determine why people easily suffer from wind-cold and excessive sweating? Shao Yu replied: If the flesh is not firm and the pores are loose, one is prone to wind. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we tell if the flesh is not firm? Shao Yu answered: The flesh behind the knee is not firm and lacks clear texture; the texture is coarse, and if the skin does not seal well, then the pores are loose, indicating a lack of integrity in the body.</p>
<p>[Note: Zhu Yongnian said: This indicates that if the skin is not tightly sealed, and the flesh&#39;s texture is coarse and loose, it allows for wind pathogens to invade internally, resulting in excessive sweating. The area below the knee is referred to as &quot;ji,&quot; which corresponds to the solar region. The solar energy governs the skin, thus if the knee flesh is not firm and lacks clear texture, it means the texture is coarse. If the texture is coarse and the skin does not seal tightly, then the pores are loose, leading to a natural outpouring of sweat.]</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we determine why some people are prone to blockages? Shao Yu replied: If the texture is coarse and the flesh is not firm, then one is prone to blockages. The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a place that indicates the severity of blockages? Shao Yu answered: To understand their severity, one must look at their respective regions.</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Texture&quot; refers to the patterns of muscles; if the texture is coarse and loose rather than tight, then pathogens linger and cause blockages.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Treatise on Bi (Obstruction) states: When the three Qi of wind, cold, and dampness come together, they combine to form Bi. Those who encounter this in winter have bone Bi, in spring have sinew Bi, in summer have vessel Bi, in the depths of winter have muscle Bi, and in autumn have skin Bi. Therefore, by observing the respective parts, one can understand the severity of Bi. Generally, Bi affecting the heart and lungs is classified as high, while that affecting the liver, kidneys, and spleen is classified as low. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we discern diseases caused by accumulation in the intestines? Shao Yu responded: When the skin is thin and lacks moisture, and the flesh is not firm but becomes damp, this leads to a deterioration of the intestines and stomach. Such deterioration causes evil Qi to stagnate and accumulate, which harms the spleen and stomach. If cold and warmth are not properly balanced, and evil Qi gradually enters, this leads to stagnation and significant accumulation. </p>
<p>Note: When the skin is thin and does not ensure a healthy moisture, and the flesh is not firm leading to lack of fluid, this results in a deterioration of the intestines and stomach. Indeed, fluid, blood, and Qi are generated from the intestines and stomach; when these deteriorate, evil Qi stagnates and leads to accumulation, which harms the spleen and stomach. If one continues to eat unregulated, with improper heating and cooling, and evil Qi enters, this fosters stagnation and significant accumulation. The intestines connect with the lungs and govern the skin and Qi, while the stomach connects with the spleen and governs flesh and fluid. Therefore, when the skin is thin and the flesh not firm, the Qi lacks fullness and fluid does not nourish. Without fullness of Qi and nourishment of fluid, the hair follicles open and pores loosen; this allows evil Qi to stagnate, gradually seeping into the intestines and stomach and resulting in accumulation.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

If one is not harmed by the winds of the four seasons, it indicates that the earth element is strong throughout the seasons. If one does not suffer from the winds of late summer, it signifies that the earth element dominates in late summer. Those with thick skin and firm flesh who are harmed by the winds of the four seasons must be significantly affected by cold. Heaven is represented by water on earth and by cold in the heavens; the kidneys correspond to the water organs and thus correspond to the cold air from heaven. This is why those with a black complexion and thick skin, who manifest illness, are particularly vulnerable to cold. This applies both externally and internally, as the external cold from heaven invades while internally it injures the kidney’s water qi.

<p>[Note: The term &quot;skin and flesh&quot; refers to the texture of the muscles, akin to how the fine meat of a pig is structured with distinct layers. The white membrane within the muscle is called fat; the fatty meat attached to the skin is referred to as fat. Thus, when the flesh behind the knee is firm and the skin taut, it denotes fat. Fat is contained within the skin, outside of the meat, and hence the flesh is firm while the skin is taut. Greasiness, on the other hand, refers to the fat substance, which entails a mixture of red and white layers akin to that of a pig. It resides between the layers of meat, which is why the meat is not firm and the skin is loose. This discourse examines the characteristics of defensive Qi in relation to fat, hence it only discusses greasiness rather than fat itself.

Therefore, those with abundant flesh have a distended belly; the fleshy ones appear large from top to bottom, while the fatty ones cannot become large despite the fat they have. </p>
<p>(Note: Regarding the three types of people, there are excesses in being overly large or deficiently small, so it is necessary to assess the quantity of blood and the quality of qi, and then make adjustments without losing the regular principles of defense qi. This results in a harmonious individual. The loss of regular defense qi causes those with abundant flesh to have a distended belly, the fleshy ones to appear large from top to bottom, while the fatty ones cannot grow large despite having fat. Defense qi governs the area between skin, flesh, tendons, and bones, floating and sinking in various depths, each in its place. If it is solely concentrated in the space between skin and flesh, leading to a distended belly and large form, or sinking deeply into the tendons and bones so that fat cannot grow large, these are all disturbances of the defense qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The True Evil of Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>The intrusion of void and evil into the body is profound; cold and heat clash, lingering long and taking root within. If cold predominates over heat, the bones ache and the flesh withers; if heat predominates over cold, the flesh rots, the muscles decay into pus, leading to internal bone injury. Internal bone injury results in bone erosion. </p>
<p>If there is an affliction in the tendons, they become bent and cannot straighten; the pathogenic energy resides within and does not retreat, causing swelling in the tendons, creating knots, and the vital energy converges, while the defending energy remains, unable to retreat. If bodily fluids linger long, they combine to form intestinal channels, and it often takes several years for this to manifest. </p>
<p>If one presses on it gently and a knot is already present, the vital energy converges, and the bodily fluids remain, while the pathogenic energy is trapped inside; as it condenses, over time it becomes more severe, congregating into what is termed a &#39;historic lump.&#39; </p>
<p>If one presses and it is firm, with a knot that penetrates deep into the bones, the energy emanates from the bones; as the bones and energy merge, it increases daily, resulting in bone abscesses. If a knot is within the flesh, the ancestral energy converges, and the evil lingers without dispersing; if there is heat, it transforms into pus, and without heat, it results in flesh abscesses.</p>
<p>All these various pathogenic energies do not emerge from fixed locations, yet they bear consistent names. <em>[Note: The clash of cold and heat refers to the yin and yang energies within the body. The essence it&#39;s about the body housing energy; when the essence is injured, the energy suffers, and vice versa. The converging of energy signifies the clashing of cold and heat, which becomes trapped within the form of evil. Thus, these various energies manifest unpredictably, yet they have established names such as flesh withering, bone erosion, tendon swelling, and historic lumps.]</em><a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Central Storage Classics</strong> (Han: Hua Tuo)</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Muscle obstruction occurs due to irregular eating habits, the consequence of rich and fatty foods. Obstruction refers to the support of the flesh, where qi has already consumed the essence of the flesh, leading to no nourishment for the muscles, and the skin lacks moisture, resulting in loose texture. Environmental factors like wind, cold, heat, and dampness easily invade; thus, if not treated early, it leads to muscle obstruction. The condition of muscle obstruction begins with the inability to feel satisfaction despite eating. The limbs are weak and unable to hold themselves. The right pulse feels weak and lacks rhythm. One should regulate diet to balance the organs, maintain a regular routine to soothe the obstruction, and then follow the classics for supplementation and drainage to seek recovery.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p>Massaging can dispel superficial evils affecting the muscles; it is advisable to massage rather than refrain from doing so, as not massaging will lead to indulgence in the muscle, lingering for a long time without dissipating. If a disease is deficient and not supplemented, it causes the qi and blood to disperse, the muscles to weaken, the spirit to diminish, and the will to become muddled. Sweating inappropriately leads to the extinction of muscles and depletion of bodily fluids. Inappropriate massage can cause muscle swelling and relaxation of tendons and bones.<br>— <em>Qianjin Fang</em> [Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao]  </p>
<p><strong>The Extremes of Flesh</strong></p>
<p>In general, the extremes of flesh correspond to the spleen. The spleen is associated with flesh, and the flesh harmonizes with the spleen. If the spleen is diseased, the flesh changes color. Moreover, it is said: when the extreme yin encounters illness, it leads to muscular atrophy; if muscular atrophy persists and is further affected by external evils, residing within the spleen, the body itches as if mice are running, and the bodily fluids escape, the pores open, resulting in profuse sweating, with a yellowish hue at the tip of the nose which is its sign. Generally, when wind and qi accumulate in the skin, the color of the flesh deteriorates. The spleen wind occurs in the late summer when the earth element is injured by the wind. The conditions of spleen wind are characterized by excessive sweating. When yin movement is injured by cold, it leads to deficiency; deficiency results in a heavy and lethargic body, with limbs reluctant to move, lacking appetite. If food is consumed, it causes coughing; coughing then results in pain under the right ribs that radiates to the shoulder and back, restricting movement. This condition is called severe wind, with internal deficiency and external fullness.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

One must determine its regulations, understand its beginnings and ends, and discern the dynamics of yin and yang and the fullness and emptiness of flesh. When it is full, one must drain it; when it is empty, one must replenish it. To treat the illness, if wind has just entered between the flesh, skin, and sinew, it must be dealt with immediately. If it has entered the six bowels and five organs, it is nearly fatal. Bian Que said: “Without decisive action, death will occur in five days.” How do we know this? When the skin does not open, external substances cannot be expelled. Flesh should correspond to the greater yin; if the qi of the greater yin is exhausted, the pulse will not nourish the flesh. The lips are the foundation of the flesh. If the pulse does not nourish, then the flesh weakens; if the flesh weakens, the middle of the mouth fills, and if the mouth fills, the lips will revert. If the lips revert and qi is exhausted, the flesh will perish first.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the flesh is deficient, one cannot sit still; the body is unstable and restless. When the flesh is strong, one can sit comfortably and breathe easily. The response of the flesh&#39;s deficiency or fullness is governed by the spleen. If the organs are sick due to the flesh, heat will affect the organs, while cold will affect the bowels.</p>
<p>Numbness</p>
<p>When the three forces of wind, cold, and dampness linger without leaving, the limbs become numb and constricted. Dampness causes smoothness; dryness causes stagnation. Thus, because dryness and dampness oppose each other, if there is stagnation throughout the body, it belongs to the transformation of dry metal, hence numbness in autumn. However, numbness is also similar to stagnation. Due to the scarcity of water and fluids, dryness leads to numbness, and when the flow of qi is obstructed, it does not achieve smoothness and clarity. If vitality is strong but struggles violently, it results in numbness. If a healthy person suppresses their limbs, their qi will suddenly move vigorously, causing stagnation and obstruction, and numbness resembles the effect of a drum on an object. Those who do not wish to move will become numb upon movement since movement increases yang, making qi surge. Thus, numbness arises. Common prescriptions for treating numbness often use black and foxglove herbs to stimulate qi flow vigorously. This creates an opening to achieve smoothness; when the medicinal properties are exhausted, balance is restored, and qi flows freely, leading to recovery from numbness. However, the six qi do not necessarily act singularly to cause illness; they often coexist. If fluids are lost leading to dryness, or there is numbness without heat symptoms, this treatment should be considered. If wind and heat overpower dampness causing dryness and resulting in numbness, one should use herbs that expel wind, dispel heat, invigorate blood, nourish fluids, and moisten dryness to regulate and thereby resolve numbness. The treatment for all kinds of dryness and stagnation should follow this principle.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Unkindness</strong></p>
<p>In the case of cold-induced numbness of the flesh, how can one clarify it? Kindness is softness. Unkindness is not softness; it is the inability to feel itching, pain, cold, or heat. When one allows the body to bend and stretch without awareness of these sensations, one is said to be unkind. This arises due to the excessive obstruction of pathogenic qi, causing the rightful qi to be suppressed and unable to emerge, leading to the deficiency of nutrative and defensive blood qi, thus failing to circulate properly. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when the nutrative qi is deficient, one experiences unkindness. The &quot;Needle Classic&quot; states that when the defensive qi does not circulate, it leads to unkindness. The classics say: when the nutrative and defensive forces cannot support each other, the triple burner has no elevation, and the body experiences numbness and unkindness. Therefore, it is made clear that understanding the deficiency of the nutrative and defensive blood qi, which cannot flow properly, results in unkindness. The classics state: those who succumb to the cold will suffer from obstruction and thus experience unkindness.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

Why is this? It is because stagnation leading to dizziness and insensitivity results in an inability to feel pain or discomfort, which can indeed be classified as a type of &quot;sudden loss of consciousness.&quot; The classic text states: when the lesser yin pulse is absent, the kidney&#39;s vitality is weak, there is a lack of essence and blood, and the rushing qi is forced upwards into the chest cavity, the ancestral qi gathers back, causing blood to stagnate beneath the heart, the yang qi retreats, heat returns to the yin, creating a mutual movement that renders the body insensitive, this is called &quot;sudden loss of consciousness.&quot; The symptoms caused by cold invasion, along with stagnation and insensitivity, clearly indicate this type of &quot;sudden loss of consciousness.&quot; In ancient times, when the people of Yue entered Guo, they diagnosed the prince&#39;s condition as &quot;sudden loss of consciousness&quot; based on stagnation and insensitivity, believing it to be treatable, and they performed acupuncture, resulting in a cure; this truly reflects the skill of a divine healer.

<p>The classics say: When the qi moves to the left, sweating should not be induced; if sweating occurs, it leads to dizziness and if the sweat does not stop, the muscles and flesh tremble. This occurs when sweating stimulates the liver qi. How can we clarify the muscle trembling in the case of cold damage? Cold damage typically presents with headaches, body aches, aversion to cold, and fever—these are inevitable signs. The muscle trembling is usually caused by excessive sweating; when yang is lost, it manifests. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Yang qi nourishes the spirit when it is refined and nourishes the muscles when it is gentle. Excessive sweating leads to depletion of fluids and weakened yang qi, causing the muscles to lose their nourishment, which results in trembling and involuntary movements. In cases of taiyang disease where the pulse is weak and sweating occurs with aversion to wind, one should not take the major green dragon decoction; taking it would lead to counterflow and muscular trembling, marking a reversal.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of Taiyang disease, if sweating is induced and the sweat does not resolve the fever, but the person continues to have fever, with dizziness and body trembling, and a sensation of wanting to hit the ground, this is treated with Zhenwu Decoction. If the movement of qi is on the left, sweating should not be induced; if it is induced, it will lead to dizziness, unceasing sweat, and trembling of the tendons and flesh. This indicates that the excessive sweating has consumed Yang, revealing Yang deficiency. Though this may seem contrary, it is necessary to stop the sweating that depletes Yang and leads to exterior deficiency, and treat with warming the meridians and nourishing Yang. If someone has symptoms of deficiency at both the exterior and interior due to vomiting, purging, and sweating, this is not the same as just the aftermath of sweating alone. The classics say: in cases of cold damage with vomiting, purging, and sweating, if there is vexation and the pulse is very weak, after eight or nine days there may be distention below the heart, pain in the sides, qi surging to the throat, dizziness, and movement of the tendons, which can lead to atrophy over time. This indicates a severe reversal. After sweating, vomiting, and purging in a case of Taiyang disease, if both the exterior and interior are deficient, and there are additional symptoms like chest distress, and a blue-yellow complexion with trembling skin, treatment is difficult. This is the gravest reversal. Sweating, vomiting, and purging should not be neglected!</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of unfeelingness:</p>
<p>If the flesh is unfeeling, it is due to a combination of wind, dampness, and cold leading to obstruction, along with numbness in the hands and feet.

One may use Yujin Powder for vomiting, and then take Daoshui Pill and lighter cold medications to purge; once purged, follow with spicy warming agents.

<p><strong>Numbness</strong>  </p>
<p>Numbness is associated with qi deficiency; &quot;wood&quot; refers to phlegm and stagnant blood. There may be cases of both qi and blood deficiency, resulting in numbness without the presence of phlegm. If there is deficiency accompanied by dampness, one experiences numbness alongside other symptoms. In cases where deficiency is compounded by the three factors of wind, cold, and damp, the whole body may experience pulling pain and numbness. In severe cases, one should expel the excess through sweating before supplementing. If phlegm stagnates in the limbs or if just one finger becomes numb for over a year, it may indicate a risk of stroke; these are all signs of prior qi and blood deficiency. Such conditions must be treated in advance.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Numbness</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The three energies of wind, cold, and dampness combine to create blockages. Hence, when wind prevails, it causes moving blockages; when cold prevails, it causes painful blockages; and when dampness prevails, it causes stagnation. He Jian states: If it lingers and does not go away, the limbs become numb and constrained. It further states: When there is pain, it is due to excessive cold; pain arises from cold. When there is no pain or numbness, it indicates a prolonged illness that has penetrated deeply. The flow of nourishment is sluggish, and the meridians are sometimes obstructed, thus there is no pain; the skin is not nourished, resulting in numbness. The so-called numbness can affect the entire body or just the limbs, leading to a tingling, numbing sensation without awareness of pain or itch, similar to the state after a rope has been released from tight binding. The ancient texts referred to this as numbness. Danxi mentions: Numbness relates to Qi deficiency, while &#39;wood&#39; symbolizes dampness, phlegm, and stagnant blood. Therefore, referring to numbness and &#39;wood&#39; is a way of distinguishing two kinds of numbness. Nonetheless, there can be cases of both Qi and blood deficiency that present only numbness without &#39;wood&#39;; there are also cases where deficiency causes dampness, leading to both numbness and pain; further, there can be conditions where deficiency allows the three energies of wind, cold, and dampness to invade, resulting in pain and numbness throughout the body. Ancient texts termed this as generalized blockage. The treatment method should prioritize sweating first, followed by supplementation. Physicians should apply similar principles to treat, rather than adhering to a single viewpoint.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>A floating and moist pulse indicates Qi deficiency. If it is felt in the front gate, the condition affects the upper body; if felt in the back gate, it affects the lower body. A floating and relaxed pulse indicates dampness, leading to paralysis; a tight and floating pulse indicates cold, leading to painful obstruction; a choppy and hollow pulse indicates stagnant blood, belonging to Wood, with no sensation of pain or itch.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Functions</strong></p>
<p>The spleen governs muscle. The classic states: the spleen governs muscle; in the body it is the muscle, in the organs it is the spleen. Moreover, if there is evil in the spleen and stomach, muscle pain will result. Spleen illness is located in the creek. The classic states: in the northern direction, black corresponds with the kidneys, hence illness in the creek. The creek is the minor convergence of muscle.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>Dampness injures the muscles, sweetness harms the muscles. The classic states: dampness injures the muscles, wind overcomes dampness. Sweetness harms the muscles, sourness overcomes sweetness. Furthermore, excessive sweetness leads to muscle diseases; consuming a lot of sourness causes muscular stiffness and lip peeling. Prolonged sitting injures the muscles. The classic states: prolonged sitting damages muscles. Moreover, emotional joy and physical delight can lead to ailments in the muscles, which should be treated with needles and stones.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Death from Flesh Loss</strong></p>
<p>When the flesh has fully detached, despite the nine conditions being regulated, it is still like this. Qi Bo desires that one understands the pulse aligned with the form. The flesh is governed by the spleen, which is the source of all things. Observing the flesh&#39;s detachment indicates internal damage to the spleen, leading to a loss of foundation. Even if the nine conditions are adjusted, one cannot escape death; how can the form be overlooked?</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>The scripture states: When spleen qi is hot, the stomach dries and thirst arises, causing the muscles to become numb, leading to muscle atrophy. The atrophy of the spleen results in muscle atrophy. The spleen and stomach are interconnected by membranes, opening at the mouth. Therefore, if spleen heat occurs, the stomach dries and causes thirst. The spleen governs muscles; internal heat depletes vital essence, resulting in numb muscles, leading to muscle atrophy.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Obstruction diseases affecting the muscles often lead to numbness, corresponding to the spleen. The symptoms include weakness in the limbs, coughing, and vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong></p>
<p>Muscle numbness occurs due to wind, dampness, and heat descending into the blood division&#39;s yin. The yang pathway is obstructed, and there may also be phlegm in the blood division. Symptoms include general muscle numbness and itching when closing one&#39;s eyes, as blood fails to nourish the skin and muscles. Treatments with ginseng and astragalus can help the yang pathway, while angelica can promote the yin pathway. The herbs Atractylodes, Poria, licorice, and rhubarb can eliminate damp heat, and schisandra, perilla, and peony can uplift the condition. Phlegm requires treatment with Er Chen. Treatment should be effective; if encountering wind and dampness, the arms may feel painful or numb, or the entire body may experience muscle numbness. Use Wu Ji San for this.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Medicine: Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Spleen Corresponds to Flesh</strong><br>If there is deficiency in any of the five organs, it will manifest externally. When the spleen is deficient, the face and limbs will exhibit weak and swollen muscles. One should channel the flow and replenish the source, which can be considered a skillful approach.</p>
<p><strong>Emaciation</strong><br>When the heart and spleen are compromised, leading to stomach damage, food does not nourish the skin and flesh. It is advisable to tonify qi and harmonize blood with appropriate diet, remedies like the Ten Benefits Great Tonifying Decoction, and Kidney-strengthening Pills.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Flesh</strong><br>When the spleen is full, it leads to muscular obstruction, the pores open, resulting in profuse sweating and weak limbs with urgent pain. One should take Job’s Tears Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong><br>When the nutrients and defenses stagnate and do not circulate, numbness occurs, similar to prolonged pressure on one area, causing inability to lift—this can be understood. Numbness is related to phlegm and deficiency; wood corresponds entirely to damp phlegm and stagnant blood, which causes insensitivity to pain or itch, leading to a state of numbness. Those with a deep, slippery pulse and a robust body are often afflicted with phlegm and dampness. Using the combinations of the two herbs of Atractylodes and Pinellia, along with possibly a few additional herbs for wind like Qiang, Duan, and Cinnamon Twig, while also incorporating Ginseng and Astragalus for qi replenishment, is beneficial.<br>For women and those with a history of repression, it is essential to clear the stagnation.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse is weak or feels large and powerless; for those who have been ill for a long time and are emaciated, the blood and qi are deficient, so one should tonify the middle and benefit the qi. Alternatively, add a piece of processed aconite and use Sheng Mai San in summer. </p>
<p>If one feels no pain or discomfort but experiences increased coldness, with symptoms that are lighter during the day and heavier at night, the pulse will be weak and hollow. </p>
<p>Phlegm mixed with stagnant blood should be treated with blood-activating and qi-moving herbs, such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, peach kernel mud, safflower, Notopterygium, and the two Chen herbs, combined with chives. For dark stools and constipation, use Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction to relieve it.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage, one may experience tremors, which are not uncommon. Yang qi, when adequate, nourishes the spirit and when gentle, nourishes the tendons. Excessive sweating leads to depletion of fluids, and when yang qi is deficient, the muscles and tendons lose nourishment, causing tremors and spasms. Without warming the channels and assisting yang with medicine, how can one expect improvement? Therefore, Shen Wu Decoction is prescribed to rescue this condition. After sweating, vomiting, or purging, when both exterior and interior are deficient, these symptoms are especially serious.</p>
<p>Numbness of the muscles refers to a lack of softness and sensitivity; even with pain or itching, one remains unaware, unable to feel needles or fire applied to the skin. When various deficiencies coincide with cold, this results in malaise and numbness. If blood and qi are weak and cannot circulate throughout the body, upright qi is suppressed by evil qi, which leads to limbs being stubbornly numb and lifeless as if they were dead. Use a decoction of equal parts cinnamon and麻 also. If this does not resolve the issue, then use the Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction with ginger juice. </p>
<p>If the body feels oily, sweating does not cease, breathing is labored, and one cannot take in water, this indicates a critical condition.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on Numbness</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Neijing,&quot; it states that the combination of the three Qi: wind, cold, and dampness results in bi syndrome. When wind predominates, it is termed &quot;xingshi,&quot; when cold predominates, it is &quot;tongbi,&quot; and when dampness predominates, it is &quot;zhangbi.&quot; The state of being neither painful nor sensitive is called numbness. Currently, the symptom of numbness aligns with the classic definition of being neither painful nor sensitive. When an illness has persisted for a long time, it penetrates deeply, causing the flow of nourishment and defense to become sluggish, leading to the obstruction of meridians, hence the absence of pain; the skin lacks nourishment, resulting in insensitivity, much like the condition of a rope that has been tied and then partially loosened.</p>
<p><strong>To treat numbness, the first step is to disperse and guide the Qi and blood that are stagnant.</strong></p>
<p>If one sits or lies in a position for an extended time, causing the Qi and blood in the meridians to become unimpeded, numbness will result, indicating stagnation. Numbness predominantly occurs in the limbs and the fingers, suggesting inadequate Qi and blood supply to the extremities, resulting in numbness. Danxi asserts the frequent use of aconite to move the meridians, which aligns with this idea. </p>
<p>For numbness in all ten fingers, this indicates a significant presence of damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach, for which the prescription of Er Chen Decoction with the addition of Atractylodes Macrocephala, Peach Kernel, and Red Flower is recommended.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Original Disease Theory&quot; lists the symptoms of numbness under the categories of the Six Qis, including Dryness and Metal. It explains that when substances gain moisture, they become smooth and moist; when they are dry, they become stagnant. Numbness is akin to stagnation. This results from a deficiency of bodily fluids leading to dryness, and from the obstruction of Qi, which prevents smooth circulation. If Qi becomes strong and forceful, it can create numbness.</p>
<p>Common remedies for numbness often include the use of black and aconite herbs, which stimulate Qi excessively, thus helping to resolve the stagnation and restore smooth circulation, resulting in the alleviation of numbness. However, the Six Qis do not necessarily imply that any single Qi alone causes disease; multiple Qis can interact. If bodily fluids are lost, leading to dryness, or if there is numbness without heat symptoms, then this must be treated accordingly. If wind-heat overwhelms dampness and leads to numbness, one should use cooling herbs to dispel wind, scatter heat, invigorate blood, nourish fluids, and moisten dryness to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>Dongyuan states that numbness signifies a deficiency of Qi. When the vital energy is weak and cannot flow properly, it blocks the meridians, resulting in weakness in the limbs and subsequent numbness. This numbness may occur in the hands or feet, or it may affect the skin overall. Remedies should include Astragalus, Ginseng, Atractylodes, Licorice, Schisandra, Peony, Angelica, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, tailored according to the seasonal Qi without rigid prescription, focusing solely on tonifying the deficiency without harshly attacking or forcing the Qi.</p>
<p>I have noted that both Liu and Li lived in the same era and place, without differences in worldly conditions or geographical suitability. Why then is there such a distinction between their approaches to treatment? This is due to their different understandings of the Way of the Sages. Liu believed that a person is born with innate gifts, and when disturbances from pathogens enter and disrupt the Qi, illness results. Therefore, attacking the pathogen is essential; once the pathogen is expelled, the vital energy can restore its balance.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

Whenever the true qi is out of balance and suffers even a little, the five evils and six afflictions can take the opportunity to invade. Therefore, the key is to supplement and correct; when the correct qi is restored, the evil qi will naturally retreat. Now, it is advisable to carefully consider the methods of the two gentlemen, to know when to attack and when to supplement, and adjust accordingly without being rigid in their theories. Danxi further divides numbness into two types; one type called &quot;ma&quot; merely stops habits and still shows no signs of the disturbance of qi and blood, while &quot;wood&quot; indicates that qi and blood have been obstructed and are unresponsive, lacking awareness of pain and itching. When an epidemic wind first arises, the hands and feet will certainly first show signs of &quot;wood&quot; and then the skin will ulcerate; similarly, in cases of boils and paralysis, the hands and feet can also become numb. One should seek the origins of this. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: when the nourishing qi is weak, there is no responsiveness; when the defensive qi is weak, there is no function; when both the nourishing and defensive qi are weak, there is neither responsiveness nor function.

<p>According to the &quot;Su Wen,&quot; when the moon begins to wax, the blood and qi energies start to accumulate, and the defensive qi begins to circulate; when the moon is full, the blood is abundant, and the muscles are firm; when the moon wanes, the muscles diminish, the meridians weaken, and the defensive qi disperses, leaving the body alone. Thus, blood and qi should be adjusted in accordance with the seasons. During cold weather, acupuncture should not pierce, during warm weather, should not congeal; in the waxing moon, there should be no purging; in the full moon, there should be no tonics; in the waning moon, there should be no treatments—this is called treating it in accordance with time.<br>Conditions based on the sequence of nature, during times of abundance and deficiency, light should be moved to adjust positioning, standing upright and waiting for the right moment.  </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for those who measure the body, if they are thin and emaciated, how can they accurately assess and needling them? By carefully examining and palpating, observing their seasonal changes in temperature and vitality, one adjusts accordingly; this is called acting in accordance with the true nature of things.</p>
<p>In spring, one targets the collaterals; in summer, the fascial layers; in autumn, the orifices of qi; in winter, the channels and collaterals. Each of these four seasons is treated according to its own timing. The collaterals address the skin, the fascial layers treat the muscles, the orifices of qi affect the tendons, and the channels and collaterals address the bones and marrow.</p>
<p>In spring, needling the collaterals causes the blood and qi to overflow outward, leading to diminished breath. Needling the muscles in spring causes blood and qi to flow in reverse, leading to shortness of breath. Needling the tendons and bones in spring causes blood and qi to stagnate inward, resulting in abdominal distension.</p>
<p>In summer, needling the channels causes the blood and qi to become depleted, leading to disorientation. Needling the muscles in summer causes the blood and qi to retreat inward, resulting in anxiety. Needling the tendons and bones in summer leads to the upward reversal of blood and qi, causing anger.</p>
<p>In winter, needling the channels causes the blood and qi to completely escape, leading to unclear vision. Needling the collaterals in winter causes internal qi to leak outward, resulting in great pain. Needling the muscles in winter leads to the depletion of yang qi, causing forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: When illness is located between the muscle layers, use a round needle at the site of the illness. </p>
<p>The method of the three needlings to release the sourness involves first shallowly needling to break the skin to expel yang pathogens, and then deeper needling to expel the yin pathogens by penetrating further into the muscle, without yet entering the space between the muscle layers. Once penetrating into the space between the muscle layers, then the sourness is released.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The meridian point He Gu is pricked, with needles placed between the muscle divisions on both sides, to relieve muscle stiffness, which corresponds to the spleen. Spring energy resides in the hair, summer energy in the skin, autumn energy in the muscle divisions, and winter energy in the tendons and bones. When treating these ailments, one must align with the appropriate seasonal energy. Therefore, for the obese, treatment should align with autumn and winter; for the lean, it should align with spring and summer.</p>
<p>If the pathogenic factors are in the spleen and stomach, muscle pain will result. When yang energy is excessive and yin energy is insufficient, there will be heat accompanied by hunger. Conversely, when yang energy is lacking and yin energy is excessive, there will be cold, intestinal sounds, and abdominal pain. If both yin and yang energies are excessive or deficient, there will be both cold and heat, which can be balanced at the San Li point.</p>
<p>For muscle pain marked by cold and heat, with hair damaged and lips dry, unable to sweat, one should tonify the three yang channels below to expel blood and supplement the taiyin to promote sweating. </p>
<p>Wind, cold, and dampness invading the exterior muscle divisions lead to urgency and particular symptoms. When dampness encounters cold, it accumulates; and when it accumulates, it disrupts the muscle divisions, causing splitting. When splitting occurs, pain arises, and when the spirit returns, there is heat; the heat alleviates the pain, which in turn leads to numbness, causing further issues which manifest in the same way.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one know the diseases of flesh? Bo Gao replied: The colors of the lips—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—indicate disease in the muscles. There is a structure within the flesh; this structure lies between the muscles of the arms and legs in the yang parts, and near the yin regions of the feet. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can it be treated? Bo Gao said: The myriad diseases are changeable, arising and subsiding, and are too numerous to exhaust; each has its place. Those in the superficial layer are less severe, while the deeper ones are more troublesome; the mild ones are few, while the severe ones are many. Adjust the qi according to the changes. Hence it is said: That which responds to the earth in humans is the flesh; therefore, when treating with needles, one must ensure that the body is tubular and the ends are rounded, so as to avoid injuring the flesh. If injured, the qi will be depleted.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rite of Filial Piety&quot; states: A man from Yancheng named Liang, over sixty years old, suddenly woke up one morning to comb his hair and noticed that the fingers of his left hand were numb. In a little while, half of his arm became numb, then the other arm followed. Soon, half of his head was numb, and by the time he finished combing, he experienced numbness from his waist down to his feet. He had not had a bowel movement for two to three days. He sought the advice of doctors, who all said it was due to wind. Some prescribed medicine, others acupuncture, but nothing worked. Eventually, he sought treatment from Doctor Dai. </p>
<p>Doctor Dai observed that all three pulse positions on the left hand were weak and three times smaller than those on the right hand, indicating a condition of deficiency and stagnation. It could not solely be attributed to wind; there was also accompanying dryness from heat. He prescribed a treatment involving one purge, one diuretic, and one sweating method, and the numbness immediately subsided. Afterwards, he balanced the condition with warming herbs and moistening draughts, but the little and ring fingers still showed some numbness. </p>
<p>Doctor Dai commented that the root of the illness had been eradicated and that this remaining sensation was just residual heat, which could be treated with acupuncture at the gu (valley) point. The gu point is where the bone is hollow. On a sunny day, he performed the acupuncture, using the technique from the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; that involves the chicken foot method. He inserted needles vertically while lying on his back, advancing and retracting them three times, then removed the needles and inserted them again while lying on his stomach, applying them to the spaces between the fingers. Afterward, the hand felt hot like fire, and all numbness had ceased. In the past, Liu Hejian wrote the &quot;Original Pathologies,&quot; often attributing numbness to dryness, thus understanding the mechanism of diseases truly well.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Treasures of Health&quot; states: When Zhang Fuchu was ill, he experienced pain in his right shoulder and arm that could not be controlled. He was unable to move, sweated excessively, the muscles were emaciated, and he could not lie down properly as it caused more pain. The classic states: Excessive sweating leads to weakness, causing a person to become emaciated. I reflect on the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which says that deficiency and excess are neighbors, and one can resolve and connect them. It also states: If one remains emaciated and stagnant, one must use acupuncture and moxibustion to unblock and harmonize the meridians, allowing blood and energy to recover. It mentions that if there is sinking energy, moxibustion should be applied, as vital energy has descended into the Yin. When the shoulder pains intermittently and cannot move, one should guide it with fire; fire leads upwards, thus replenishing and warming. All these symptoms are suitable for acupuncture and moxibustion. It is said that one should first puncture the Jing points of the twelve meridians. On April 12, I first needled the Jianjing point on the upper shoulder of the right arm, then applied moxibustion for fifteen sessions, whereupon sore areas began to emerge, and gradually muscle was added to the lean areas, sweating decreased, and the shoulder and arm regained some strength. By May 8, I applied moxibustion again at Jianjing and then at the Chize point, each for twenty-eight sessions, directing energy downward to connect with the righteous energy. The next day, the arm again gained strength and could move. It was mid-summer, with increasing heat, so I prescribed Qingfei Yin to tonify lung energy, nourish the spleen and stomach, and calm the heart.</p>
<p>In &quot;Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Records,&quot; it is stated: A parturient woman experienced numbness in both hands. After taking Yufeng Dan and Tianma Pills, she felt numbness all over the body, was lethargic, thirsty during the evening, and experienced spontaneous sweating and night sweats. I prescribed several doses of Shenqi Dabu Decoction, after which all symptoms receded. After a few more doses, she recovered completely. However, because of internal heat, I used Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder for her cure.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman initially suffered from a deficiency of vital energy. When fatigued, her body became numb and warm, with phlegm and qi rising to attack. She was treated with remedies like Wuyao Shunqi Powder and Qufeng Huatan Pill. Her limbs were weak and her phlegm and saliva were spontaneously expelled. She had a sallow complexion and felt fatigued, with her spleen and lungs notably weak, indicating deficiency resembling wind. She improved gradually with the morning use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and evening use of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. Eventually, she was treated with a modified Gui Pi Decoction and recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng&quot; states: Mrs. Li Zhengchen was diagnosed with a pulse that was thin and taut, both full and slow, with no strength upon palpation. The tautness was at the superficial level, indicating wind-heat sinking into the yin, obstructing the yang path. Her symptoms included complete body numbness with closed eyes, which was less severe in the daytime and worse at night; upon awakening and opening her eyes, the numbness gradually receded, and if prolonged, it would stop. She kept her eyes open due to fear of numbness, causing insomnia. Her body felt heavy, with occasional phlegmatic cough, a constant sensation of phlegm in her chest that was not easily expelled, and intermittent agitation with shortness of breath and wheezing. Her skin appeared swollen, but her appetite and bowel movements were normal. The greatest suffering was the fear of numbness and the inability to close her eyes. Observing her color and pulse, her symptoms matched the state of her illness without contradiction. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In yang conditions, opening the eyes and moving is light; in yin conditions, closing the eyes and resting is heavy. It further states: All pulses are related to the eyes.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The “Lingshu” states: When the eyes are opened, the yang pathway operates, and the yang energy spreads throughout the body; when the eyes are closed, the yang pathway is blocked and does not operate. This is like the division between day and night, understanding that the yang declines while the yin flourishes. Furthermore, numbness is caused by wind; even a three-foot-tall child understands this, but upon closer examination, it is not true. For instance, one becomes numb after sitting for a long time. If a person is tightly bound by a rope, once released, they may feel numb but dare not move; after a while, they adapt. Observing this, it is clear that it is not an invasion of wind, but rather that the energy is stagnant. There is no need to treat for wind; one should tonify the lung&#39;s energy, and then the numbness will dissipate. Understanding that the yin fire within the meridians affects the yang aspect, with internal movement causing numbness, one should also eliminate the yin fire to achieve recovery. When there is phlegm and coughing, it is due to the coolness of autumn on the outside and dampness causing discomfort. One should warm the skin with warming medicinals. When the body feels heavy and the pulse is slow, it indicates trapped dampness. When an anxious sensation appears, one should raise the yang, support the qi, and enrich the blood, subtly drain the yin fire and eliminate dampness, allowing the meridians to flow and balancing the yin and yang. It does not signify an innate evil in the five organs and six bowels. The remedy is to supplement qi, elevate yang, and harmonize.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>During the severe winter frost, Lady Li fell ill, with her limbs weak and paralyzed, indicating damp heat in the lower body. The bitter heart indicates that the turbid qi does not descend and is accumulating. If the eyes are numb when closed, it signifies that the yang pathways are not functioning. If the eyes are not numb when open, it indicates that the opening of the eyes aids the yang pathways, thus slightly alleviating the cold qi. Dizziness and spinning in the head indicate that the wind qi has sunk into the blood aspect, and it arises without stretching out. The &quot;Warming the Meridians and Eliminating Dampness Decoction&quot; is prescribed for this condition.</p>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Dali, Han Zhuquan, experienced complete paralysis and could not move, seeking treatment from me. I provided him with a modified version of the &quot;Miraculous Efficacy Astragalus Decoction,&quot; using one liang and two qian of astragalus, and six qian each of ginseng and peony. The rest of the ingredients were similar, and one dose was reduced by half. He wanted immediate results, so he combined two doses into one, and within ten days, his illness seemed to vanish. I advised him that with his original qi beginning to recover, he should rest to nourish it, and only after it became solid should he go out. He could not follow this advice and suddenly went out during the heat of summer, attending to guests and becoming fatigued over several days. One day, while exiting the morning chamber and mounting a horse, he unexpectedly nearly fell over. Companions assisted him to the guesthouse and invited me to examine him, but I declined treatment.

These organs transform the impure into essence, varying flavors as they intake and expel. Its manifestation is seen in the four white areas of the lips, its fullness resides in the flesh; its flavor is sweet, and its color is yellow. This represents the extreme yin, which corresponds to the earth's energy. [Note: The foot of the Greater Yin receives the impurity of food and drink, serving as the conduit for transportation. The intestines and stomach lead in receiving and transmitting food and drink, the sanjiao governs the regulation of water pathways, while the bladder is the reservoir for water essence; thus, they are all fundamental to storage. The spleen houses nourishment, hence it is the dwelling for nourishment. The term \"器\" denotes the universe of generation and transformation, capable of rising, descending, entering, and exiting. The spleen can process the impure and transform flavors that nourish the five organs, while expelling waste through the two yin organs; hence it is called a vessel. The \"four whites\" refer to the white flesh surrounding the four corners of the lips. The mouth serves as an orifice of the spleen and governs the flesh, hence its manifestation appears at the four white areas of the lips, its fullness exists in the flesh. Sweetness corresponds to the flavor of earth, and yellow represents its color. The spleen is the utmost yin within yin, corresponding to the earth's energy. This section refers specifically to the spleen, while the intestines, stomach, sanjiao, and bladder engage in receiving and transmitting both the essence and residue of food and drink, thus being collectively called the foundation of storage.

The spleen opens at the mouth, which is why its manifestation is in the lips. The spleen is earth and is constrained by the liver's wood; thus, the liver is the main organ generating the spleen.] Eating too much sour food leads to the flesh becoming rigid and the lips becoming curled, as this hurts the five flavors. [Note: Consuming too much sour food represents an excess of the wood flavor, which damages the spleen, causing the flesh to become rigid and the lips to curl.

Treated with massage and medicinal decoctions. *Note: Shock disrupts qi, and fear causes qi to descend; blood follows qi. When qi is disordered, meridians fail to function, and the vital and defensive energies do not circulate, resulting in illness from insensitivity. Therefore, massage and medicinal decoctions should be used to promote the circulation of vital and defensive blood and qi.* **Discussion on Reversal and Regulation** The Emperor said: For a person whose flesh is harsh, even when near soft clothing, it still feels harsh. What illness does this signify? Qi Bo replied: The nourishing qi is weak, while the protective qi is strong. When the nourishing qi is weak, insensitivity arises; when the protective qi is strong, it cannot be used. If both the nourishing and defensive energies are weak, it results in insensitivity and ineffectiveness, leaving the flesh unchanged. *Note: \"Harsh\" means cruel. Even when flesh is close to soft clothing, it still feels cruel. Weakness and strength indicate imbalance. The nourishing qi cannot harmonize with the protective qi, leading to the weakness of the nourishing qi and the strength of the protective qi. The path of yang is always strong, hence it is called strong. Thus, excess is as bad as deficiency. Insensitivity is the inability to feel pain or itch, while ineffectiveness means weakness and an inability to function. The phrase indicates the disharmony between nourishing and protective energies, both being weak. When both energies are weak, there is insensitivity and ineffectiveness, and insensitivity and ineffectiveness with unchanged harshness of flesh indicate a lack of harmony, resulting in weakness.*"},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Bi (Obstruction)** When Bi (obstruction) is in the flesh, it is not benevolent. *[Note: The visceral qi externally combines with the physical body; if the physical form is affected but does not harm its qi, one can only see that the flesh is unresponsive without pain.]* **Discussion on Wei (Atrophy)** There is a gradual effect from dampness; concerning water, if something remains, and one resides in dampness, the flesh becomes moist and soaked, leading to obstructions and lack of responsiveness, resulting in muscle atrophy.

Qi Bo replied: The major convergence of flesh is in the valley, while the minor convergence is in the creek. Between the divisions of flesh, the convergence of creeks and valleys enables the flow of nourishment and defense, congregating great qi. If evil qi overflows and obstructs, causing the pulse to heat and the flesh to decay, and if nourishment and defense do not circulate, it will inevitably lead to pus. If internal consumption affects the bone marrow and externally it damages the major joints, and if it lingers at the joints, it will certainly lead to failure. Accumulation of cold lingers and the nourishment and defense do not reside, causing the flesh to shrink and muscles to contract, resulting in inability to extend the ribs and elbows; internally this leads to bone numbness, and externally to lack of sensation, termed insufficiency; this is the great cold residing in the valleys. The creeks and valleys gather three hundred sixty-five cavities, corresponding to the year. Minor numbness and overflow travel along the pulse; where fine needles reach, it aligns with the principle. *Note: The flesh has major divisions, like the meat of the thigh and arm, each with its own boundaries; minor divisions refer to the inner muscle tissue, which also has patterns and lines. Despite the division, they interconnect, thus the major division is the major convergence, and the minor division is the minor convergence. Between the divisions, the flow of the nourishment and defense qi gives the name 'creek and valley.' Great qi refers to ancestral qi. Qi is yang; if evil remains in the superficial layers of the flesh, when evil and righteousness clash, it results in pathogenic heat, hence the diseases manifest as pus and decay.*"},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"When evil qi overflows, the righteous qi becomes obstructed. The energy of the streams and valleys connects with the meridians; thus, when the pulse is hot inside, the flesh decays outside. If the flow of nourishment and defense is impaired, then blood and qi stagnate and become obstructed. If pus and evil stagnate between the joints and flesh, then the tendons and bones will surely deteriorate. The accumulation of cold leads to the inability of nourishment and defense to reside within, causing the cold evil to stagnate and not be harmonized by righteous qi, resulting in the flesh curling and the tendons contracting. The ribs and elbows serve as the joints of the tendons and bones, hence they cannot stretch or relax. Evil is obstructed outside, causing internal bone blockages. When the nourishment and defense rebel inward, this results in outward numbness, termed insufficiency. The overflow of heat evil signifies excess, while the nature of cold is stagnation, hence leading to insufficiency. This great cold evil lingers between the streams and valleys, causing illness to the tendons and bones. Within the streams and valleys, there are also three hundred sixty-five points corresponding to a year, akin to the pathways of the sun. These can be pierced with fine needles to expel the evil. Minor blockages refer to the initial invasion of evil into the skin, without harming the tendons and bones. The meridian referred to is the sun pathway. When the evil resides in the skin and travels along the meridian, treating it with expulsion is similar to the method for the sun pathway, and it is not necessary to inquire about the specific points. This speaks to how evil initially invades a person; it starts with the skin, then the sun pathway, enters the muscles, and affects the tendons and bones.

Generally, summer signifies growth, and autumn signifies maturation, whereas late summer is associated with transformation.

The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we discern diseases caused by accumulation in the intestines? Shao Yu responded: When the skin is thin and lacks moisture, and the flesh is not firm but becomes damp, this leads to a deterioration of the intestines and stomach. Such deterioration causes evil Qi to stagnate and accumulate, which harms the spleen and stomach. If cold and warmth are not properly balanced, and evil Qi gradually enters, this leads to stagnation and significant accumulation.

Indeed, fluid, blood, and Qi are generated from the intestines and stomach; when these deteriorate, evil Qi stagnates and leads to accumulation, which harms the spleen and stomach. If one continues to eat unregulated, with improper heating and cooling, and evil Qi enters, this fosters stagnation and significant accumulation. The intestines connect with the lungs and govern the skin and Qi, while the stomach connects with the spleen and governs flesh and fluid.

Numbness When the three forces of wind, cold, and dampness linger without leaving, the limbs become numb and constricted. Dampness causes smoothness; dryness causes stagnation. Thus, because dryness and dampness oppose each other, if there is stagnation throughout the body, it belongs to the transformation of dry metal, hence numbness in autumn. However, numbness is also similar to stagnation. Due to the scarcity of water and fluids, dryness leads to numbness, and when the flow of qi is obstructed, it does not achieve smoothness and clarity. If vitality is strong but struggles violently, it results in numbness. If a healthy person suppresses their limbs, their qi will suddenly move vigorously, causing stagnation and obstruction, and numbness resembles the effect of a drum on an object. Those who do not wish to move will become numb upon movement since movement increases yang, making qi surge. Thus, numbness arises. Common prescriptions for treating numbness often use black and foxglove herbs to stimulate qi flow vigorously. This creates an opening to achieve smoothness; when the medicinal properties are exhausted, balance is restored, and qi flows freely, leading to recovery from numbness. However, the six qi do not necessarily act singularly to cause illness; they often coexist. If fluids are lost leading to dryness, or there is numbness without heat symptoms, this treatment should be considered.

He Jian states: If it lingers and does not go away, the limbs become numb and constrained. It further states: When there is pain, it is due to excessive cold; pain arises from cold. When there is no pain or numbness, it indicates a prolonged illness that has penetrated deeply. The flow of nourishment is sluggish, and the meridians are sometimes obstructed, thus there is no pain; the skin is not nourished, resulting in numbness. The so-called numbness can affect the entire body or just the limbs, leading to a tingling, numbing sensation without awareness of pain or itch, similar to the state after a rope has been released from tight binding. The ancient texts referred to this as numbness. Danxi mentions: Numbness relates to Qi deficiency, while 'wood' symbolizes dampness, phlegm, and stagnant blood. Therefore, referring to numbness and 'wood' is a way of distinguishing two kinds of numbness. Nonetheless, there can be cases of both Qi and blood deficiency that present only numbness without 'wood'; there are also cases where deficiency causes dampness, leading to both numbness and pain; further, there can be conditions where deficiency allows the three energies of wind, cold, and dampness to invade, resulting in pain and numbness throughout the body. Ancient texts termed this as generalized blockage. The treatment method should prioritize sweating first, followed by supplementation. Physicians should apply similar principles to treat, rather than adhering to a single viewpoint."},{"anchor":"trans-34p","marker":"34p","type":"translation","text":"**Pulse Diagnosis** A floating and moist pulse indicates Qi deficiency.

The classic states: the spleen governs muscle; in the body it is the muscle, in the organs it is the spleen. Moreover, if there is evil in the spleen and stomach, muscle pain will result. Spleen illness is located in the creek. The classic states: in the northern direction, black corresponds with the kidneys, hence illness in the creek. The creek is the minor convergence of muscle. **Causes of Illness** Dampness injures the muscles, sweetness harms the muscles. The classic states: dampness injures the muscles, wind overcomes dampness. Sweetness harms the muscles, sourness overcomes sweetness. Furthermore, excessive sweetness leads to muscle diseases; consuming a lot of sourness causes muscular stiffness and lip peeling. Prolonged sitting injures the muscles.

Qi Bo desires that one understands the pulse aligned with the form. The flesh is governed by the spleen, which is the source of all things. Observing the flesh's detachment indicates internal damage to the spleen, leading to a loss of foundation. Even if the nine conditions are adjusted, one cannot escape death; how can the form be overlooked? **Muscle Atrophy** The scripture states: When spleen qi is hot, the stomach dries and thirst arises, causing the muscles to become numb, leading to muscle atrophy. The atrophy of the spleen results in muscle atrophy. The spleen and stomach are interconnected by membranes, opening at the mouth. Therefore, if spleen heat occurs, the stomach dries and causes thirst. The spleen governs muscles; internal heat depletes vital essence, resulting in numb muscles, leading to muscle atrophy. **Spleen Obstruction** Obstruction diseases affecting the muscles often lead to numbness, corresponding to the spleen. The symptoms include weakness in the limbs, coughing, and vomiting. **Numbness** Muscle numbness occurs due to wind, dampness, and heat descending into the blood division's yin. The yang pathway is obstructed, and there may also be phlegm in the blood division. Symptoms include general muscle numbness and itching when closing one's eyes, as blood fails to nourish the skin and muscles. Treatments with ginseng and astragalus can help the yang pathway, while angelica can promote the yin pathway. The herbs Atractylodes, Poria, licorice, and rhubarb can eliminate damp heat, and schisandra, perilla, and peony can uplift the condition. Phlegm requires treatment with Er Chen.

When the spleen is deficient, the face and limbs will exhibit weak and swollen muscles. One should channel the flow and replenish the source, which can be considered a skillful approach. **Emaciation** When the heart and spleen are compromised, leading to stomach damage, food does not nourish the skin and flesh. It is advisable to tonify qi and harmonize blood with appropriate diet, remedies like the Ten Benefits Great Tonifying Decoction, and Kidney-strengthening Pills. **Extreme Flesh** When the spleen is full, it leads to muscular obstruction, the pores open, resulting in profuse sweating and weak limbs with urgent pain. One should take Job’s Tears Powder. **Numbness** When the nutrients and defenses stagnate and do not circulate, numbness occurs, similar to prolonged pressure on one area, causing inability to lift—this can be understood. Numbness is related to phlegm and deficiency; wood corresponds entirely to damp phlegm and stagnant blood, which causes insensitivity to pain or itch, leading to a state of numbness. Those with a deep, slippery pulse and a robust body are often afflicted with phlegm and dampness. Using the combinations of the two herbs of Atractylodes and Pinellia, along with possibly a few additional herbs for wind like Qiang, Duan, and Cinnamon Twig, while also incorporating Ginseng and Astragalus for qi replenishment, is beneficial.

Alternatively, add a piece of processed aconite and use Sheng Mai San in summer. If one feels no pain or discomfort but experiences increased coldness, with symptoms that are lighter during the day and heavier at night, the pulse will be weak and hollow. Phlegm mixed with stagnant blood should be treated with blood-activating and qi-moving herbs, such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, peach kernel mud, safflower, Notopterygium, and the two Chen herbs, combined with chives. For dark stools and constipation, use Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction to relieve it. In cases of cold damage, one may experience tremors, which are not uncommon. Yang qi, when adequate, nourishes the spirit and when gentle, nourishes the tendons. Excessive sweating leads to depletion of fluids, and when yang qi is deficient, the muscles and tendons lose nourishment, causing tremors and spasms. Without warming the channels and assisting yang with medicine, how can one expect improvement? Therefore, Shen Wu Decoction is prescribed to rescue this condition. After sweating, vomiting, or purging, when both exterior and interior are deficient, these symptoms are especially serious. Numbness of the muscles refers to a lack of softness and sensitivity; even with pain or itching, one remains unaware, unable to feel needles or fire applied to the skin. When various deficiencies coincide with cold, this results in malaise and numbness. If blood and qi are weak and cannot circulate throughout the body, upright qi is suppressed by evil qi, which leads to limbs being stubbornly numb and lifeless as if they were dead. Use a decoction of equal parts cinnamon and麻 also. If this does not resolve the issue, then use the Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction with ginger juice.

When wind predominates, it is termed \"xingshi,\" when cold predominates, it is \"tongbi,\" and when dampness predominates, it is \"zhangbi.\" The state of being neither painful nor sensitive is called numbness. Currently, the symptom of numbness aligns with the classic definition of being neither painful nor sensitive. When an illness has persisted for a long time, it penetrates deeply, causing the flow of nourishment and defense to become sluggish, leading to the obstruction of meridians, hence the absence of pain; the skin lacks nourishment, resulting in insensitivity, much like the condition of a rope that has been tied and then partially loosened. **To treat numbness, the first step is to disperse and guide the Qi and blood that are stagnant.** If one sits or lies in a position for an extended time, causing the Qi and blood in the meridians to become unimpeded, numbness will result, indicating stagnation. Numbness predominantly occurs in the limbs and the fingers, suggesting inadequate Qi and blood supply to the extremities, resulting in numbness. Danxi asserts the frequent use of aconite to move the meridians, which aligns with this idea. For numbness in all ten fingers, this indicates a significant presence of damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach, for which the prescription of Er Chen Decoction with the addition of Atractylodes Macrocephala, Peach Kernel, and Red Flower is recommended."},{"anchor":"trans-39p","marker":"39p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Original Disease Theory\" lists the symptoms of numbness under the categories of the Six Qis, including Dryness and Metal. It explains that when substances gain moisture, they become smooth and moist; when they are dry, they become stagnant. Numbness is akin to stagnation. This results from a deficiency of bodily fluids leading to dryness, and from the obstruction of Qi, which prevents smooth circulation. If Qi becomes strong and forceful, it can create numbness. Common remedies for numbness often include the use of black and aconite herbs, which stimulate Qi excessively, thus helping to resolve the stagnation and restore smooth circulation, resulting in the alleviation of numbness. However, the Six Qis do not necessarily imply that any single Qi alone causes disease; multiple Qis can interact. If bodily fluids are lost, leading to dryness, or if there is numbness without heat symptoms, then this must be treated accordingly. If wind-heat overwhelms dampness and leads to numbness, one should use cooling herbs to dispel wind, scatter heat, invigorate blood, nourish fluids, and moisten dryness to facilitate circulation. Dongyuan states that numbness signifies a deficiency of Qi. When the vital energy is weak and cannot flow properly, it blocks the meridians, resulting in weakness in the limbs and subsequent numbness. This numbness may occur in the hands or feet, or it may affect the skin overall. Remedies should include Astragalus, Ginseng, Atractylodes, Licorice, Schisandra, Peony, Angelica, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, tailored according to the seasonal Qi without rigid prescription, focusing solely on tonifying the deficiency without harshly attacking or forcing the Qi. I have noted that both Liu and Li lived in the same era and place, without differences in worldly conditions or geographical suitability. Why then is there such a distinction between their approaches to treatment? This is due to their different understandings of the Way of the Sages. Liu believed that a person is born with innate gifts, and when disturbances from pathogens enter and disrupt the Qi, illness results. Therefore, attacking the pathogen is essential; once the pathogen is expelled, the vital energy can restore its balance."},{"anchor":"trans-40p","marker":"40p","type":"translation","text":"Using the true qi of a person nourishes the hundred bones and circulates throughout life. Whenever the true qi is out of balance and suffers even a little, the five evils and six afflictions can take the opportunity to invade. Therefore, the key is to supplement and correct; when the correct qi is restored, the evil qi will naturally retreat. Now, it is advisable to carefully consider the methods of the two gentlemen, to know when to attack and when to supplement, and adjust accordingly without being rigid in their theories. Danxi further divides numbness into two types; one type called \"ma\" merely stops habits and still shows no signs of the disturbance of qi and blood, while \"wood\" indicates that qi and blood have been obstructed and are unresponsive, lacking awareness of pain and itching. When an epidemic wind first arises, the hands and feet will certainly first show signs of \"wood\" and then the skin will ulcerate; similarly, in cases of boils and paralysis, the hands and feet can also become numb. One should seek the origins of this. The \"Suwen\" states: when the nourishing qi is weak, there is no responsiveness; when the defensive qi is weak, there is no function; when both the nourishing and defensive qi are weak, there is neither responsiveness nor function. The \"Ling Shu\" states: if the defensive qi does not flow, then one is bound to experience numbness."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"In Dongyuan's treatment of paralysis, it is essential to supplement the defensive Qi and proceed accordingly; this serves as the fundamental approach.

If the skin feels numb, it indicates that the lung Qi is not circulating; thus, the Shaoyao Qi Decoction should be used. If the muscles are numb, one must clear the nutrients to recover. If damp heat is present, causing heaviness and pain in the limbs, one should expel the dampness and heat. According to the \"Jinkui,\" if blood deficiency presents with both Yin and Yang being weak, the pulse at the cun position is faint, and the pulse at the chi position is mildly tight, while external signs show numbness resembling wind blockage, the Huangqi and Guizhi Five Ingredients Decoction should be prescribed.

According to the \"Su Wen,\" when the moon begins to wax, the blood and qi energies start to accumulate, and the defensive qi begins to circulate; when the moon is full, the blood is abundant, and the muscles are firm; when the moon wanes, the muscles diminish, the meridians weaken, and the defensive qi disperses, leaving the body alone. Thus, blood and qi should be adjusted in accordance with the seasons. During cold weather, acupuncture should not pierce, during warm weather, should not congeal; in the waxing moon, there should be no purging; in the full moon, there should be no tonics; in the waning moon, there should be no treatments—this is called treating it in accordance with time. Conditions based on the sequence of nature, during times of abundance and deficiency, light should be moved to adjust positioning, standing upright and waiting for the right moment. For diseases of the skin, needling the skin should not injure the flesh; if the flesh is hurt, it causes internal disturbance to the spleen. If the spleen is disturbed, it leads to abdominal distension and loss of appetite, with symptoms lasting for seventy-two days across the seasons. Needling the skin without harming the flesh indicates that the disease is within the skin; a needle inserted into the skin does not injure the flesh. The Yellow Emperor asked: Can the dimensions of the meridians, the amount of blood, the thickness of the skin, the firmness of the flesh, and the size of the knees be measured? Qibo replied: What can be measured is the average; it should not excessively deplete the flesh while ensuring the blood and qi do not diminish."},{"anchor":"trans-58p","marker":"58p","type":"translation","text":"As for those who measure the body, if they are thin and emaciated, how can they accurately assess and needling them? By carefully examining and palpating, observing their seasonal changes in temperature and vitality, one adjusts accordingly; this is called acting in accordance with the true nature of things. In spring, one targets the collaterals; in summer, the fascial layers; in autumn, the orifices of qi; in winter, the channels and collaterals. Each of these four seasons is treated according to its own timing. The collaterals address the skin, the fascial layers treat the muscles, the orifices of qi affect the tendons, and the channels and collaterals address the bones and marrow. In spring, needling the collaterals causes the blood and qi to overflow outward, leading to diminished breath. Needling the muscles in spring causes blood and qi to flow in reverse, leading to shortness of breath. Needling the tendons and bones in spring causes blood and qi to stagnate inward, resulting in abdominal distension. In summer, needling the channels causes the blood and qi to become depleted, leading to disorientation. Needling the muscles in summer causes the blood and qi to retreat inward, resulting in anxiety. Needling the tendons and bones in summer leads to the upward reversal of blood and qi, causing anger. In winter, needling the channels causes the blood and qi to completely escape, leading to unclear vision. Needling the collaterals in winter causes internal qi to leak outward, resulting in great pain. Needling the muscles in winter leads to the depletion of yang qi, causing forgetfulness. The \"Lingshu\" says: When illness is located between the muscle layers, use a round needle at the site of the illness. The method of the three needlings to release the sourness involves first shallowly needling to break the skin to expel yang pathogens, and then deeper needling to expel the yin pathogens by penetrating further into the muscle, without yet entering the space between the muscle layers. Once penetrating into the space between the muscle layers, then the sourness is released."},{"anchor":"trans-59p","marker":"59p","type":"translation","text":"The meridian point He Gu is pricked, with needles placed between the muscle divisions on both sides, to relieve muscle stiffness, which corresponds to the spleen. Spring energy resides in the hair, summer energy in the skin, autumn energy in the muscle divisions, and winter energy in the tendons and bones. When treating these ailments, one must align with the appropriate seasonal energy. Therefore, for the obese, treatment should align with autumn and winter; for the lean, it should align with spring and summer. If the pathogenic factors are in the spleen and stomach, muscle pain will result. When yang energy is excessive and yin energy is insufficient, there will be heat accompanied by hunger. Conversely, when yang energy is lacking and yin energy is excessive, there will be cold, intestinal sounds, and abdominal pain. If both yin and yang energies are excessive or deficient, there will be both cold and heat, which can be balanced at the San Li point. For muscle pain marked by cold and heat, with hair damaged and lips dry, unable to sweat, one should tonify the three yang channels below to expel blood and supplement the taiyin to promote sweating. Wind, cold, and dampness invading the exterior muscle divisions lead to urgency and particular symptoms. When dampness encounters cold, it accumulates; and when it accumulates, it disrupts the muscle divisions, causing splitting. When splitting occurs, pain arises, and when the spirit returns, there is heat; the heat alleviates the pain, which in turn leads to numbness, causing further issues which manifest in the same way."},{"anchor":"trans-60p","marker":"60p","type":"translation","text":"The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one know the diseases of flesh? Bo Gao replied: The colors of the lips—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—indicate disease in the muscles.

The Yellow Emperor asked: How can it be treated? Bo Gao said: The myriad diseases are changeable, arising and subsiding, and are too numerous to exhaust; each has its place. Those in the superficial layer are less severe, while the deeper ones are more troublesome; the mild ones are few, while the severe ones are many. Adjust the qi according to the changes.

Soon, half of his head was numb, and by the time he finished combing, he experienced numbness from his waist down to his feet. He had not had a bowel movement for two to three days. He sought the advice of doctors, who all said it was due to wind. Some prescribed medicine, others acupuncture, but nothing worked. Eventually, he sought treatment from Doctor Dai. Doctor Dai observed that all three pulse positions on the left hand were weak and three times smaller than those on the right hand, indicating a condition of deficiency and stagnation. It could not solely be attributed to wind; there was also accompanying dryness from heat. He prescribed a treatment involving one purge, one diuretic, and one sweating method, and the numbness immediately subsided. Afterwards, he balanced the condition with warming herbs and moistening draughts, but the little and ring fingers still showed some numbness. Doctor Dai commented that the root of the illness had been eradicated and that this remaining sensation was just residual heat, which could be treated with acupuncture at the gu (valley) point. The gu point is where the bone is hollow. On a sunny day, he performed the acupuncture, using the technique from the \"Ling Shu\" that involves the chicken foot method. He inserted needles vertically while lying on his back, advancing and retracting them three times, then removed the needles and inserted them again while lying on his stomach, applying them to the spaces between the fingers. Afterward, the hand felt hot like fire, and all numbness had ceased.

He was unable to move, sweated excessively, the muscles were emaciated, and he could not lie down properly as it caused more pain. The classic states: Excessive sweating leads to weakness, causing a person to become emaciated. I reflect on the \"Inner Canon,\" which says that deficiency and excess are neighbors, and one can resolve and connect them. It also states: If one remains emaciated and stagnant, one must use acupuncture and moxibustion to unblock and harmonize the meridians, allowing blood and energy to recover. It mentions that if there is sinking energy, moxibustion should be applied, as vital energy has descended into the Yin. When the shoulder pains intermittently and cannot move, one should guide it with fire; fire leads upwards, thus replenishing and warming. All these symptoms are suitable for acupuncture and moxibustion. It is said that one should first puncture the Jing points of the twelve meridians. On April 12, I first needled the Jianjing point on the upper shoulder of the right arm, then applied moxibustion for fifteen sessions, whereupon sore areas began to emerge, and gradually muscle was added to the lean areas, sweating decreased, and the shoulder and arm regained some strength. By May 8, I applied moxibustion again at Jianjing and then at the Chize point, each for twenty-eight sessions, directing energy downward to connect with the righteous energy. The next day, the arm again gained strength and could move. It was mid-summer, with increasing heat, so I prescribed Qingfei Yin to tonify lung energy, nourish the spleen and stomach, and calm the heart.

She had a sallow complexion and felt fatigued, with her spleen and lungs notably weak, indicating deficiency resembling wind. She improved gradually with the morning use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and evening use of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. Eventually, she was treated with a modified Gui Pi Decoction and recovered. The \"Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng\" states: Mrs. Li Zhengchen was diagnosed with a pulse that was thin and taut, both full and slow, with no strength upon palpation. The tautness was at the superficial level, indicating wind-heat sinking into the yin, obstructing the yang path. Her symptoms included complete body numbness with closed eyes, which was less severe in the daytime and worse at night; upon awakening and opening her eyes, the numbness gradually receded, and if prolonged, it would stop. She kept her eyes open due to fear of numbness, causing insomnia. Her body felt heavy, with occasional phlegmatic cough, a constant sensation of phlegm in her chest that was not easily expelled, and intermittent agitation with shortness of breath and wheezing. Her skin appeared swollen, but her appetite and bowel movements were normal. The greatest suffering was the fear of numbness and the inability to close her eyes. Observing her color and pulse, her symptoms matched the state of her illness without contradiction.

Furthermore, numbness is caused by wind; even a three-foot-tall child understands this, but upon closer examination, it is not true. For instance, one becomes numb after sitting for a long time. If a person is tightly bound by a rope, once released, they may feel numb but dare not move; after a while, they adapt. Observing this, it is clear that it is not an invasion of wind, but rather that the energy is stagnant. There is no need to treat for wind; one should tonify the lung's energy, and then the numbness will dissipate. Understanding that the yin fire within the meridians affects the yang aspect, with internal movement causing numbness, one should also eliminate the yin fire to achieve recovery. When there is phlegm and coughing, it is due to the coolness of autumn on the outside and dampness causing discomfort. One should warm the skin with warming medicinals. When the body feels heavy and the pulse is slow, it indicates trapped dampness. When an anxious sensation appears, one should raise the yang, support the qi, and enrich the blood, subtly drain the yin fire and eliminate dampness, allowing the meridians to flow and balancing the yin and yang.
