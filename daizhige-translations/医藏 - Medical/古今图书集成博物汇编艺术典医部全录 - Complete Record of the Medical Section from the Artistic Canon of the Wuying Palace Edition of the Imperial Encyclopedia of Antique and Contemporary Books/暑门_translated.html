<p><strong>Summer Heat</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theory of Vital Qi Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>Due to summer heat, sweating occurs; when one is agitated, there is panting and loud breathing, while in stillness, there is excessive talking. The body feels like burning charcoal, sweating profusely and dispersing. </p>
<p>*[Note: The yang evil of heaven harms the yang energy of the body, causing the qi to weaken and sweat to flow. If the pathogenic heat in the qi aspect is severe, it makes the person feel unsettled. The heart governs the pulse, thus the heart feels troubled. The lungs cover the heart, hence agitation leads to panting. If there is stillness without agitation, this pathogen remains in the qi aspect, harming the qi, and as the spirit is weakened, there is excessive talking. The yang evil of heaven harms the yang energy, and with the two yang aspects clashing, the body feels like burning charcoal. The yang heat pathogen resolves through the body&#39;s yin fluids, leading to sweating and dispersing.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on the Governance of the Five Constants</strong></p>
<p>In the Lesser Yang, presiding over heaven, the fire energy descends, while the lung energy ascends. The Great Heat manifests, leading to coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion, oral ulcers, and fluctuations of heat and cold, with swelling. 【Note: In the records of Jin Ping, its organ is the lungs. The ascendance refers to the response to the descending heavenly energy, as one fears being overwhelmed by it. Coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion are all lung diseases. Oral ulcers, fluctuations of heat and cold, and swelling indicate heat conditions.】 </p>
<p>In the Lesser Yin, presiding over heaven, the hot energy descends, while the lung energy ascends. The white metal is utilized, vegetation becomes blighted, leading to wheezing, vomiting, and fluctuations of cold and heat, with sneezing, nasal congestion, and difficulty breathing. The Great Heat, when prevalent, can lead to ulcers and scorching, resembling molten metal and flowing stones. 【Note: The blight of vegetation, and the prevalence of Great Heat, is more intense than in spring and summer. The flow of molten metal and stones indicates excessive heat in autumn and winter.**</p>
<p><strong>The Great Treatise on the Correct Records of the Six Origins</strong></p>
<p>In the governance of the Lesser Yin presiding over heaven, the four energies interact, with the humid heat arriving, and heavy rain occurring frequently, alternating between cold and heat. The people suffer from symptoms of cold and heat, dryness in the throat, jaundice, nasal congestion, and excessive thirst. 【Note: In years of excessive conditions, relating to the four chief and guest energies, the humid earth is the master of the atmosphere. The mingling of humid and hot energies causes the arrival of humid heat and heavy rain, leading to alternating cold and heat. The people&#39;s symptoms of dry throats and jaundice are all due to the influence of humid heat.】 </p>
<p>In the realm of the Lesser Yang, it is the governor of the scorching heat and the place of heat accumulation, as well as the source of outflows. 【Note: The arrival of energies refers to the conditions of the four seasons influenced by the five movements and six energies, with the Lesser Yang governing the summer heat. The outflow refers to the energy emerging from within to the outside.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>On the Importance of True Principles</strong></p>
<p>The victory of the lesser yin occurs when summer heat arrives, leading to symptoms such as nausea, irritability, abdominal fullness and pain, diarrhea, and a condition known as red dampness. 【Note: The arrival of summer heat coincides with the interaction of the lesser yang energy. Nausea indicates the upward rebellion of yin energy. Irritability reflects the symptoms of yin and yang coldness and heat. Abdominal fullness and diarrhea indicate the presence of cold yin below. The condition of red dampness suggests the excess fire of the heart descending.】<br>— <em>Lingshu Classic</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Seasonal Dew</strong></p>
<p>Human beings are affected by the four seasons and the eight winds, which is why there are cold and hot periods. In the cold, the skin tightens and the pores close; in the heat, the skin relaxes and the pores open. 【Note: The infiltration of pathogenic winds and evil qi into people is caused by the fluctuations of their vital energy, which allows for varying depths of invasion, not dependent solely on the opening and closing of cold and heat.】<br>— <em>Bian Que’s Difficult Classic</em></p>
<p><strong>Heat as a Cause of Heart Disease Related to Just and Disordered Conditions</strong></p>
<p>How can one recognize the injury caused by summer heat? The presence of foul odors indicates this. Why is that? The heart dominates odors; it manifests as burnt odors if excess heat accumulates within the heart, as fragrant odors when entering the spleen, as fetid smells when affecting the liver, as rotten smells when impacting the kidneys, and as fishy odors when it influences the lungs. Therefore, it is understood that heart disease can result from the damage caused by summer heat, characterized by aversion to foul smells, accompanied by a heated body, irritability, and pain in the heart, with an energetic pulse that is large and scattered. 【Note: The heart&#39;s dominion over odors indicates that the heart suffers from summer heat, hence the aversion to foul smells, a symptom that is reflected in the pulse diagnostics, all pertaining to the heart.】<br>The injury caused by summer heat relates to just and disordered conditions.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>[Note: Zheng and xie refer to the sick individual in this text. Heatstroke is considered xie, caused by fire from illness.]</strong><br><strong>Shanghan Lun [Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji]</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are three types of heatstroke.</strong></p>
<p>For heatstroke from excessive sun, the symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, thirst, and a heavy body. <strong>[Note: If there is sweating, chills, and fever without thirst, it indicates a wind attack. If there is sweating, chills, fever, and thirst, it indicates heatstroke, which is treated with Bai Hu decoction plus ginseng according to Jin Gui.]</strong> </p>
<p>For heatstroke due to excessive heat, the symptoms are fever and chills, with body heaviness and pain. The pulse is thin, wiry, and slow. If urination is light and sparse with the hair standing on end, and hands and feet are cold, slight exertion will raise body temperature, with a dry mouth and tongue. If sweating occurs, chills will worsen; if warming needles are applied, fever will increase; if purgatives are used excessively, it will lead to serious dysuria. <strong>[Note: There are conditions affecting the surface and the interior, and some that affect both. This indicates an illness affecting both. Fever, chills, heaviness, and pain signify a heatstroke affecting the surface. A thin, wiry pulse indicates vacuity due to heatstroke. Sparse urination and cold extremities suggest insufficient qi in the Taiyang meridian.]</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Those who have slight labor and feel heat are said to exert their yang and become thirsty. If the mouth is dry with the front teeth exposed, this indicates significant heat. If one seems to be gasping and cannot stop, it is due to the dryness of the front teeth. If sweating alleviates exterior evils, then the external yang qi is deficient, leading to severe aversion to cold. If warming needles are used to assist yang, then internal heat attacks, causing an increase in body temperature. If purging is done to eliminate internal heat, then there is internal deficiency and dryness in the bladder, resulting in severe dysuria. Xu said: This condition has no defined treatment; Dongyuan treats it with Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction, claiming it reveals the ancient secret.</p>
<p>Those with heat due to solar exposure experience heavy body pain with weak pulses; this results from cold water injuring them in summer, which causes fluid accumulation beneath the skin. The classic states: weak pulse and body heat arise from summer heat damage. Heat with weak pulses indicates thirst. Heavy body pain signifies water retention. In summer, exposure to high heat and water can lead to this condition. The &quot;Jinkui&quot; references a remedy involving the dried gourd stem powder or possibly the Wuling Powder.</p>
<p>Pulse Text<br>By Wang Shuhe of the Jin Dynasty </p>
<p>Heat-induced weak pulses</p>
<p>A weak pulse with body heat indicates summer heat damage, resulting in spontaneous sweating, agitation, and palpitations. Fever related to yin deficiency requires early treatment; nourishing and enhancing qi must not be delayed.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Book of Living People</strong> <strong>[Song Dynasty, Zhu Gong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>When suffering from heat stroke, if the affliction is deep-rooted and does not heal, the person experiences incessant thirst. The remedy is to take wine-steamed Huanglian pills.</p>
<p><strong>Heat and Humidity Combined Illness Leading to Damp-Warmth</strong></p>
<p>If a person has previously suffered from dampness and then succumbs to heat stroke, the combination of damp and heat may manifest as damp-warmth, causing painful coldness in both legs, abdominal distension, excessive sweating from the chest, severe headaches, and delirium. The pulse will feel weak and moist on the Yang side, while the Yin side will be feeble and rapid. The treatment lies within the Taiyin; one must not induce sweating. If sweating occurs, the person will be unable to speak, may have hearing loss, and will no longer feel pain at the site of the affliction, with a bluish complexion. This condition is referred to as severe heat stroke, and if death occurs, it is due to the failure of the physician. The remedy is to use the White Tiger Soup with Cangzhu.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Season Adjustment Methods</strong></p>
<p>During the intense heat of summer, one must not wash the hands and face with cold water, as it harms the eyes significantly. The summer season is a time when people&#39;s spirits are easily drained; the heart is vigorous while the kidneys are weak. The kidneys transform into water, solidifying in autumn and becoming firm in winter. Therefore, one should be particularly careful with intimate activities and ensure the preservation of one&#39;s spirit.</p>
<p><strong>The Direct Guidelines of the Ren Zhai</strong> <strong>[Song Dynasty, Yang Dengfu]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heat Enters Through the Mouth and Nose</strong></p>
<p>The heart is interconnected with the stomach. If the stomach&#39;s energy is slightly deficient, or due to hunger one encounters heat, the heat toxins enter through the mouth and nose, condensing in the teeth and cheeks, reaching the heart like an echo. Therefore, if one encounters heat, it is advisable to rinse the mouth with water but not swallow it.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Heat Stroke</strong> </p>
<p>Heat stroke occurs because the pulse is weak; it is because heat injures the vital energy without harming the physical body. Furthermore, &quot;heat&quot; corresponds to the heavens as heat, to the earth as fire, and to the human body as the heart. Thus, heat particularly injures the heart, causing symptoms such as body heat and headaches, resembling cold diseases, but with coldness in the back and dirt on the face, which distinguishes it. Symptoms include fainting, loss of consciousness, cold extremities, thirst, dry mouth, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and a feeling of fullness—all resulting from heat intake. </p>
<p>Generally, recovering from heat stroke requires avoiding cold water and lying on cold, damp ground, as exposure to cold can be fatal. Instead, one should maintain warmth, applying hot water compresses to the abdomen and the lower dantian, or using hot soil up to the navel, continuing to expel urine. Wait until the person gradually regains consciousness, then slowly administer rice soup and adjust treatment based on symptoms. </p>
<p>Recently, in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, there have been many incidents of heat stroke leading to convulsions, where the person is unresponsive; such cases are not documented in medical texts. Diagnosing the pulse as floating and weak indicates that floating relates to wind, and weak relates to heat—this is heat stroke compounded by wind, commonly known as &quot;heat wind.&quot; If one treats it as a shock or seizure, it often leads to no recovery. In urgent situations, it is advisable to dissolve Su He Xiang pills in warm water and administer them, awaiting slight recovery. Afterward, use a decoction of Huang Lian and Xiang Ru powder combined with Qiang Huo for treatment, and many have responded well to this method.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Heatstroke causes profuse sweating, a weak pulse, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, and irritability, sometimes with chills or a fear of heat. Whether the symptoms are exterior or interior, Baihu Decoction is appropriate. If there is severe internal heat, fullness in the abdomen, and a sinking pulse that can be purged, Da Chengqi Decoction is recommended, or San Yi Chengqi Decoction is especially effective.</p>
<p>For those with heatstroke presenting with spontaneous sweating and a weak pulse, the heat injures qi, causing excessive sweating; hence, the pulse cannot be strong and instead becomes weak.</p>
<p>Symptoms of heatstroke include body heat, headache, chills in the back, sallow complexion, spontaneous sweating, irritability, extreme thirst, dry mouth, fatigue without body pain, sometimes with chills or fear of heat, a weak pulse, and regardless of exterior or interior symptoms, Baihu Decoction is suitable. In summer, catching a cold often leads to fever and thirst; thus, Wuling Powder, Guiling Ganlu Drink, Huanglian Xiangru Drink, or Shuangjie Powder can be used. If internal heat is severe, abdominal fullness, and a sunk pulse can be purged, Da Chengqi Decoction should be applied, or San Yi Chengqi Decoction is particularly good. For those in a half-exterior, half-interior condition, Xiao Chaihu Decoction, Liangge Powder, or Tianshui Powder can be used.</p>
<p>Movement and stillness are different.</p>
<p>In cases of movement leading to heat injury, the heart fire intensifies and lung qi is fully depleted, resulting in body heat and a bounding pulse. When movement produces excess fire, it injures qi. Baihu Decoction with ginseng is the main treatment. Those in hard labor often acquire this condition; it is essential to be aware of it.</p>
<p>In cases of stillness leading to heat injury, fire occupies the position of metal, lung qi moves to the exterior, resulting in chills and a rapid, deep pulse. When stillness results in excess dampness, the body feels heavy. Baihu Decoction with Atractylodes is the primary treatment. Those in a state of comfort frequently suffer from this; it is important to be aware.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Distinction between Heat Stroke and Excess Heat</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: Heat stroke is caused by remaining still, while excess heat is caused by movement. Heat stroke is a yin condition, and excess heat is a yang condition. If one avoids the heat in a deep hall or grand building and falls ill, it is called heat stroke. The symptoms will include headache, aversion to cold, a stiff body, joint pain, irritability, and extremely hot skin without sweat, due to being restrained by the yin cold of the room, preventing the body&#39;s yang energy from spreading out; Da Shun San is the remedy for this. However, if a traveler or farmer labors in the midday sun, it is called excess heat. The symptoms will include severe headache, agitation, feeling overheated, and extremely hot skin, with great thirst and copious sweating; one will lack the energy to move, which is an external injury to the lung energy from the intense heat, and the remedy is Cang Zhu Bai Hu Tang. </p>
<p>I propose that heat-related illnesses are a result of summer&#39;s decree; fire flows between heaven and earth, and people may labor or suffer from hunger, resulting in depleted vital energy that is insufficient to withstand the extreme decree of heaven, leading to injury and illness known as heat stroke or excess heat; in essence, they are the same. Why, then, distinguish them by movement and stillness? Indeed, heat stroke often occurs in laborers; the exertion makes them weak, and weakness allows pathogens to enter, causing illness. If one is not weak, then despite the extreme decree of heaven, there would be no way to harm them. Those who avoid the heat in deep halls and suffer from symptoms like headaches and aversion to cold are simply suffering from exposure to cold, and should not be labeled as experiencing heat stroke.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The distress caused by heat and the body feeling overly warm is not due to summer heat; rather, it is because the yang energy within the body is restrained by yin and cold. Since it is not summer heat, how can it be called heatstroke? If one wishes to treat it, then a gentle, warming formula can be used for dispersion. The Great Shun Powder is the main formula, with licorice as the most prominent ingredient, followed by dried ginger and almonds. Except for the cinnamon, the other three ingredients are all toasted, and this was originally intended to address the effects of overheating from excessive drinking, causing the spleen and stomach to be damp, leading to vomiting, where food and fluids become indistinct, and the organs are out of harmony. Thus, licorice and dried ginger are both roasted to ensure they are well-prepared. The use of cinnamon instead of cinnamon twig is meant to provide warming properties. The inclusion of almonds serves merely to help descend the qi. However, if this medicine is used to treat a static condition, I fear it cannot release the exterior and might actually increase internal distress. In today&#39;s society, many lack understanding and often assert that in the summer months, the internal yin energy is present, and the Great Shun Powder is a necessary medicine. Alas! Is this not a serious mistake? Yin energy is not cold energy; indeed, in summer, the yang energy disperses outward, while yin energy remains within. Is it appropriate to perceive yin energy as cold and use warming medicines against it? If yin were truly cold, why would water be consumed in summer? While the苍朮白虎汤 (Cang Zhu Bai Hu Decoction) is indeed suitable, should it be viewed as a universally applicable remedy? It must be combined with treatments for heat, using them according to the symptoms observed, for then it would be reasonable. As for what is called a diagnosis from a static condition, even during the summer months, if it is not a case of summer illness, it should be differentiated and not allow future generations to confuse the similar yet different signs.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>On Heat Injury to Stomach Qi</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Stabbing Will&quot; states: Qi deficiency causes body heat, which results from summer heat injury. Heat damages Qi. The &quot;Treatise on Atrophy&quot; mentions: If one travels a great distance and becomes tired, encountering great heat and thirst, then thirst will deplete Yang Qi. If Yang Qi is depleted, heat will abandon the kidneys, which are the water organ. If water cannot overcome fire, bones will become dry and marrow will be deficient, leading to weakness in the legs and resulting in bone atrophy. Thus, the &quot;Lower Classics&quot; state: Bone atrophy arises from great heat. This form of damp-heat leads to atrophy, causing the bones to lack strength. Therefore, we treat atrophy primarily with Yangming.</p>
<p>During the long summer, damp-heat prevails and it is intensely oppressive. When people are affected by this, they often experience fatigue in their limbs, diminished spirit, reluctance to move, chest fullness, shortness of breath, heavy limbs and joints, or high fever with wheezing, a hot and irritable body, distension below the heart, yellow and scant urine, frequent and loose bowel movements, possibly with diarrhea resembling yellow liquid, or resembling thin rice soup. One may feel thirsty or not, lack appetite, sweat excessively and feel heavy, or sweat less—indicating blood is affected first while Qi remains unwell. The pulse presents as flooding and relaxed.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If humidity collides, it must be treated with a gradual approach. Although the ailments may interchange and heal slowly, the cause is the same with heat and dampness in summer; therefore, it is advisable to treat it with drying and clearing agents. The Internal Classic states: &quot;Yang Qi protects the exterior and solidifies it; when it is insufficient, Qi leaks.&quot; Now, as summer pathogens disturb the protective layer, thus causing heat and sweating, the remedy is to use astragalus, ginseng, and licorice to tonify and enhance Qi. The peel of tangerine, and the body of angelica, sweet, spicy, and slightly warm, nourish the stomach Qi and harmonize the blood vessels, serving as assistants. Atractylodes, white atractylodes, and poria promote diuresis to eliminate dampness; caulis cum propriety and kudzu root, bitter, sweet, and neutral, effectively relieve muscle heat. </p>
<p>Additionally, when dampness prevails, digestion is affected, leading to bloating; thus, roasted malt, sweet and spicy, and the sweet warm flavor of green tangerine promote digestion and alleviate Qi stagnation. The kidneys dislike dryness, so urgent will require spicy foods to moisten, thus using bitter, spicy, and cold rhubarb to balance heat and supplement fluids. Those with deficiency should nourish their source of transformation using five-flavored fruit and ophiopogon, which are sour, sweet, and slightly cold, to counter the damage from summer heat throughout the metal phase. This is named the Clear Summer Heat and Qi Enhancing Decoction. Summer sickness arises from irregular diet and overexertion, which, over time, weakens the spleen and stomach, resulting in illness during the hot summer days.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Managing Heat According to Seasonal Changes</strong></p>
<p>During the extremely hot months of summer, if one is harmed by cold and hard substances, warm medicines should be used. For instance, the herb Mu Xiang combined with Jian Wan will treat this condition. It is necessary to add a small amount of San Huang Wan, as it is said that the seasonal environment should not be violated; thus, cold medicines are added to align with the season. If harmed by heat, then only San Huang Wan should be used. What does this mean? San Huang Wan is a warm medicine.</p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach are weak, there will certainly be insufficient upward energy. When encountering the intense heat of summer, it can damage vital energy, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down. The limbs may become weak, and there is a lack of spirit, with the feet feeling limp. In the face of early morning or evening cold, after the sun is high and the Yang energy is strong, heat rises like fire, resulting in a lack of both Yin and Yang energy and blood. This might cause either heat syncope due to Yin deficiency or cold syncope due to Qi deficiency. Patients may struggle to taste food, feel a burning sensation in their eyes, see little clearly, experience frequent urination, and have difficult and constipated bowel movements. There may also be pain in the stomach and heart area, pain or cramping on both sides, a feeling of tightness around the navel, sharp pain akin to a knife when it becomes acute, a feeling of fullness in the abdomen, a sensation of blockage in the chest, occasional nausea, or phlegm cough; frothy white foam may form in the mouth, with a stiff tongue. Pain in the lower back and along the shoulder blades may occur, headaches may be episodic, appetite may diminish or a sense of fullness may arise immediately upon eating, showing no desire for food, along with particularly profuse sweating. </p>
<p>If Yin energy stands above the skin and hair, this is due to the heat of the weather exacerbating the original affliction, leading to the heat of the large intestine and lungs being affected. One must first help to boost the vital energy and address the insufficiency of the metal elements (geng and xin). The formula Huang Qi Ren Shen Decoction is advisable for this.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>If there is stagnation and discomfort in the heart, add two or three fen of huanglian; if there is pain in the chest and stomach, reduce cold medicines and add five fen of cardamom seed; for pain or cramping in the flanks, add two or three fen of chaihu; if there is headache with burning in the eyes, add two or three fen of huanglian and three fen of chuanxiong; if headaches are accompanied by unclear vision, with upper obstruction and heat, add three fen each of manjingzi and chuanxiong, two fen each of dry rehmannia and liangchen, and one fen of xiexin; if shortness of breath causes a feeling of drowsiness and fatigue, add nine pieces of wuweizi; if the stools are dry and difficult to pass, leading to reduced appetite and blood being blocked with heat, add five fen each of danggui, shengdi, and mazi ren, and three peeled peach kernels ground separately; if the stools are passing well, do not take those added medicines again; if the stools are still delayed, do not use other medicines but add five fen of softened dahuang; if they remain unwell, it is not that blood is stagnant but heat causing wind, therefore the patient will show signs of wind disease; one cannot add blood medicines again, only routinely take huangqi and ginseng decoction, using five qian each of qianhu and fangfeng, chewing the two herbs, steep them in four bowls of water until reduced to one bowl, strain out the residues, and take it on an empty stomach, and the stools will certainly pass freely. One dose will suffice.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>If there is stagnation of qi in the chest, add one or two parts of fresh aromatic green peel, and double the amount of cured tangerine peel to expel its evil qi. This condition is fundamentally due to insufficient original qi; thus, one should supplement original qi and not drain it. If the qi stagnation is too severe or if the tonics are excessive, and the patient has worries and oppressed feelings beneath the heart, add two or three parts of mu xiang (saussurea) and sha ren (amomum) as well as two parts of white cardamom to be cooked with the main herbs. If there are abdominal pains without aversion to cold, add five parts of white peony root and two parts of yellow qin, while reducing the amount of schisandra. </p>
<p>Xu said: This refers to heat from summer, with similar symptoms. In the winter, cold injury manifests in different forms. The former injures the qi due to heat, while the latter damages the form due to cold. If the original qi is severely deficient and the condition is not addressed in time, it can be as harmful as cold damage with its hidden toxins. Therefore, Dongyuan&#39;s teachings illuminate this case, opening the eyes of future generations, and it is advisable to consider it together with Wei Men’s insights.</p>
<p>Sun Simiao stated: Regularly consuming schisandra in May helps to drain fire from the heart and tonify the large intestine, thereby benefiting the original qi of the five organs.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The cold of the bladder has already ceased with the snake (巳), and the kidney&#39;s water has ceased with the horse (午). Now, encountering a time of abundant moisture, it assists heat as an evil influence, while the cold from the west and north is completely cleared away. The sage established laws, stating that in summer, what should be supplemented is the true qi of the heavenly origin, not to supplement heat fire, which leads one to consume cold foods in summer. To counteract heat that injures the original qi, ginseng, ophiopogon, and schisandra are used to nourish the pulse. The pulse represents the original qi. The sweetness of ginseng supplements the original qi and drains excessive heat. The bitter coldness of ophiopogon nourishes the source of water and clears dryness that affects the metal (lungs). The sourness of schisandra drains fire while supplementing the large intestine and lung metal. At this time, even those without illness may still exhibit two conditions: either avoiding summer heat by seeking coolness in deep halls and large buildings, which is termed heat stroke.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The patient will inevitably experience headaches and chills, a tense and rigid body, aching limbs and joints, and a troubled mind. The skin will be very hot and without sweat, restrained by the cold and dampness of the dwelling, preventing the yang energy from circulating throughout the body. Many in the world use Da Shun San to treat this. If a traveler or farmer works in the heat of midday and becomes afflicted, it is called &quot;zhong re&quot; (heat strike). The symptoms will include severe headaches, dryness and fever, hot skin upon touch, great thirst leading to drinking, profuse sweating, and an inability to move due to a deficiency of qi. This is caused by external heat harming the lung qi, treated with Cang Zhu Bai Hu Tang. Jie Gu states: acquiring this from movement is called &quot;zhong re,&quot; while acquiring it from stillness is called &quot;zhong shu&quot; (heat stroke). Zhong shu is an yin condition, needing to be dispersed. Zhong re is a yang condition, resulting from heat harming the original qi, rather than from physical illness. If a person with pre-existing weakness in the spleen and stomach encounters this summer heat, they will surely lose balance, going against natural processes, and will be overcome with fatigue and weakness, speaking little, and having shortness of breath, weak and labored respiratory function, resembling wheezing without being truly wheezing. Their body will feel weak and insubstantial, as if in a dream, hazy like smoke, unaware of their bodily state, accompanied by profuse sweating. This is the loss of essential fluids, and urgent measures should be taken to stop it.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Add six pieces of Schisandra, five parts of fried Coptis, and three parts of fried Anemarrhena. Do not let it interfere with eating; adjust according to one&#39;s feelings. If it hinders appetite, stop and wait until food is consumed before taking it again. For Sanli and Qijie, draw blood with a three-edged needle; if sweating does not lessen or stop, draw blood three inches below the Sanli point and at the upper edge of the Lian point, and avoid alcohol and damp foods.</p>
<p>The Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction treats diseases caused by dietary fatigue that damage the spleen and stomach, exacerbated by summer heat. However, the ingredients that include Ze Xie, Zhu Ling, Fu Ling, Deng Xin, Tong Cao, and Mu Tong, which mildly promote urination, also draw on the excesses of seasonal Qi to relieve the invasions affecting the spleen and stomach, while compensating for the deficiencies of metal and water. This formula has been adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>If misapplied to conditions without specific seasonal damp-heat or spleen excess symptoms, or if urination has already increased and the kidneys and liver are not affected, it will surely lead to excessive draining of true Yin, depleting kidney water and first harming the eyes. Therefore, modifications should be made.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>There is another condition: when the weather is very hot, it can be acquired from labor on the road, or working in the fields; sometimes it occurs in those who are physically weak, eat little, and labor excessively; there are also those who are devoted to good deeds and maintain a constant fast, whose stomach qi has long been deficient, and suffer from this condition due to excessive labor. All these cases resemble the symptoms of internal heat with the Bai Hu Decoction (White Tiger Decoction). There must be strong heat felt in the body upon touching it, as well as irritability and restlessness, extreme heat, thirst leading to excessive drinking of water, and pain seen at the onset of the illness, which is particularly similar to symptoms arising from excessive external heat. If mistakenly treated with Bai Hu Decoction, one would surely die within ten days. This condition indicates a severe deficiency of the spleen and stomach, with insufficient vital energy, shortness of breath through the mouth and nose. After the sun shifts, when the yangming reaches its peak, the illness will surely lessen. If the condition pertains to external heat, by sunset, there will be much more irritability, increased heat, and unrelenting thirst. Those who labor insufficiently do not exhibit these symptoms and are easier to resolve. If there are difficult and ambiguous symptoms, one should wait a day or two before seeking medical treatment, ensuring that mistakes are avoided.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> (Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>For heat stroke, use Huanglian Xiangru drink. If phlegm is present, add Banxia and Nanzhen. For deficiency, add Ginseng and Astragalus. If there is internal injury from heat illness, use Qingshu Yiqi soup. Heat exposure results in phlegm, which should be expelled. </p>
<p>Heat refers to the intense summer heat; it represents excessive fire energy, which can cause various degrees of damage and injury that can be classified in severity and distinctions between excess and deficiency. Those with abdominal pain and diarrhea may have the stomach and large intestine affected; those with nausea may have phlegm and fluid in the stomach, both being cases of heat exposure, and can use Huanglian Xiangru drink or Qingshu Yiqi soup, as Huanglian clears the heat and Xiangru dispels excess water. </p>
<p>For those with body heat, headaches, restlessness, or sensations like being pricked by needles, this is due to heat injury in the flesh. One should use Detoxifying soup or Baihu soup with added Chaihu; if there are signs of deficiency, add Ginseng.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>If one experiences coughing, chills and fever, with persistent night sweats and a rapid pulse, it indicates heat in the lung meridian. Use remedies like Clear Lung Decoction or Chaihu Tianshui Powder for urgent treatment; if delayed, recovery is difficult, leading to the peril of fire overpowering metal, which is a condition of heatstroke. In treating illnesses, one must clearly discern and must not confuse treatments. Such conditions may also occur in spring and autumn; do not adhere rigidly but adjust the prescription according to the illness.</p>
<p>Dai Sigong says: heatstroke refers to fainting suddenly in summer. It can be caused by fire or phlegm. Fire stems from the two essential fires, while summer heat comes from the two celestial fires; together they create a burning condition, leading to fainting. Phlegm is a bodily fluid that, when heated by summer, gets stirred up and obstructs the heart&#39;s passages, causing limbs to lose movement and fainting. Both can be resolved by inducing vomiting. The Inner Classic states: &quot;If fire is stagnant, cause it to be expelled.&quot; Vomiting leads to dispersal. Assess the condition&#39;s excess or deficiency to induce vomiting, and after recovering consciousness, you may use a clear remedy for treatment.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Zhong He</p>
<p>Zhong He is a condition of excess heat, while heat stroke is a condition of excess cold. If the pulse is weak and deep, cool herbs should not be used. Clearing heat is best achieved with Tian Shui, Wu Ling, or Bai Hu Tang. For heat causing confusion and delirium, use Chen Sha Wu Ling San. If the pulse is wiry and strong, Huang Lian Xiang Ru Tang should be used. If there is severe heat with spontaneous sweating, thirst, and constipation, Wu Ling can be used to promote fluid movement, or Gui Ling Gan Lu Yin. For vomiting and diarrhea with a very weak pulse, Fu Zi Da Shun San can be used. If heat has been injured by cold, Shu Pi Yin or Liang Xiang Yin Zi can both be taken cold. One may also insert garlic cloves into the nostrils or prepare garlic water for irrigation; the potent smell of garlic can open all orifices.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>On Summer Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Summer is associated with yin deficiency and insufficient vital energy. At the beginning of summer and the end of spring, symptoms such as headaches, weak limbs, decreased appetite, and a feeling of heat in the body are noted. It is advisable to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Rx to tonify the middle and augment the qi) with the removal of Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, adding to it roasted Huang Bo and Bai Shao. For those with phlegm, add Nao Xing, Ban Xia, and Chen Pi for decoction. Alternatively, Sheng Mai Tang (Rx to generate the pulse) may be used. In cases of summer heat combined with phlegm and fire, emetic methods can be employed.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Lurking Yin in Summer Months</strong></p>
<p>Heaven and Earth operate through a singular vital essence, creating myriad things. The essence rooted in the internal is called &quot;shen ji&quot; (spiritual mechanism), while that rooted externally is referred to as &quot;qi&quot; and &quot;blood.&quot; All things share this singular essence. Humans are spiritually connected to these matters; in form, they partake in the cosmos, thus becoming a triad with Heaven and Earth, facilitated by their correct acquisition of qi. Therefore, when qi rises, people also rise, when qi floats, they also float; when qi descends, they descend, and when qi sinks, they also sink. Humanity shares this fundamental key with Heaven and Earth. </p>
<p>In the first month of the lunar calendar, yin is born, representing the initial movement of yang; in the third month, yang emerges from the earth, marking the ascent of qi. In the sixth month, when yang fully emerges from above, it signifies the floating of qi. The abdomen of a person is connected to the earth&#39;s qi, which at this time floats to the skin&#39;s surface, leading to a void in the abdomen. The classic text states: &quot;In summer, the meridians are full, the earth’s qi overflows, meridians receive blood, and the skin is filled.&quot; During the long summer, qi resides in the muscles, hence the surface is full, and when the surface is full, the interior must be deficient. It is said that in summer, lurking yin resides internally; this notion of yin implies deficiency. To interpret it as simply cold would be a significant misunderstanding.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Someone said: By placing the hand on the abdomen, it is clear that it is cold; if not cold, then what is it? Previous scholars treated heat-related illnesses with remedies like Yulong Pills, Dashun Powder, Guiling Pills, boiled ginger with herbs, and other warming formulas. Why does my disciple not contemplate this profoundly? I replied: In spring and summer, we nurture yang; Wang Taibu said that we should eat cool foods in spring and cold foods in summer to nourish yang. This intention is evident. However, places with cool waters, large fans, and cold springs, as well as icy fruits and snow, harm us internally and externally. Without warmth, how can one find peace from illness? Upon careful examination, it is not meant for internal hidden cold. Moreover, ancient sages stated that rising and falling should be followed while cold and heat should be countered. If, in the summer when the fire element is strong, one blindly uses warmth, how can one avoid the real and illusory dangers? Someone else said: The month of Si is purely yang, which may make sense. May has one yin, and June has two yins; is this not cold? I replied: This is the initial movement of yin underground, while four yangs float above ground, scorching and burning like gold melting stone. How can there be any cold? The sage Sun created the Shengmai Powder to be consumed in summer; is this not real?<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>Key Points on Treatment for Heat Stroke</h3>
<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Heat stroke is characterized by a damp, waxy face and collapse, confusion, and unconsciousness. There is profuse cold sweating and slightly cold extremities. Symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, or difficulty breathing. Avoid using cold water or excessively cold substances. A herbal formula can be used to dispel heat, and water can be administered. Alternatively, powdered herbal remedy can be mixed with water, or powdered herbal remedy can be prepared and administered with water. Once the patient shows signs of recovery, give them a warm drink of agastache (香薷) without sediment, adding a small amount of musk for consumption. You may also insert garlic cloves in the nostrils or administer garlic water. The heat and toxins from the heat stroke injure both the exterior and interior. Many heat-relieving medicines contain warming ingredients, such as ginger and cinnamon in the Dashun San, cloves in the Loquat Leaf Powder, and agastache in the agastache drink. Agastache has a spicy and warming nature, as does garlic, which is also strongly pungent and can open all pathways. Generally, extremely pungent and fragrant substances can clear the pathways effectively.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>When one first feels symptoms of heatstroke, apply a sun-heated tile or cloth soaked in hot broth to the lower abdomen, and urgently administer a decoction of the two qi pills mixed with broth. There was once a guest who suffered from heatstroke, appearing confused, with cold sweat pouring down, limbs cold and lifeless, wanting to throw himself into water, and drooling. This heatstroke was severe, with yin and yang separated, difficult to remedy.</p>
<p>There is also a milder form of heatstroke, where the person feels drowsy and disinclined to speak. For a robust person, prepare a decoction with fragrant plantain and add one qian of huanglian; for a weak person, use a decoction of star anise and add one qian of fragrant plantain. If after treatment cold sweat continues, limbs remain cold, and there is much thirst and agitation, fragrant plantain decoction should be given. If doctors improperly administer cold remedies, it could lead to persistent vomiting and diarrhea, causing internal coldness and external heat, with increased agitation and thirst, resulting in a desire to be bare, resembling typhoid. In these cases, warming remedies should be used, combining fragrant plantain decoction with fuzi, prepared cold for consumption. For thirst, a decoction of shrinking spleen should be made with fuzi, also prepared cold for consumption.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Heat Injury</strong></p>
<p>Heat injury must be accompanied by sweating, with a cold back and dirty face. Sometimes there is a hot and restless mouth, or headaches and fever, with a marked sense of mental fatigue. This is what is referred to as heat injuring the qi but not the body. However, if the body is not in pain, it differs from the effects of wind or cold. One should take a drink of sweet basil, Liu He soup, or sweet basil soup.</p>
<p>For those experiencing vomiting and thirst, soaking cold sweet basil soup or taking Wuling powder with summer heat remedy pills is advisable. If vomiting persists, one should use loquat leaf powder with broomcorn root and take the return dan. For vomiting with excessive phlegm, take the summer heat powder with summer heat remedy pills, or Xioa Ban Xia Fu Ling soup, or a summer heat drink.</p>
<p>For diarrhea and thirst, mix raw Ping Wei powder and raw Wuling powder in equal parts, called Wei Ling Powder; intermittently take the return dan. This dan is not originally a drug for treating diarrhea, but it is suitable for summer heat diarrhea; however, if diarrhea is severe, it should not be used.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>If there is diarrhea and persistent thirst, one can use spring regulations soup or reduce the spleen drink. When suffering from summer heat with a feeling of heaviness and discomfort in the heart, people often say it is summer poison attacking the heart, not knowing that where there is heat, there is phlegm, and the heaviness and discomfort are caused by phlegm. In the peak of summer heat, if suddenly there is no water and one is extremely thirsty, chewing on green onion about two inches long can replace drinking two liters of water. </p>
<p>For diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain with stagnant accumulation, a mixture of fresh five-lichen powder and fragrant qi drink in equal parts can be applied. If there is diarrhea but no accumulation, and the abdominal pain is severe, one can use fresh five-lichen powder with seven parts of musk, or add half a coin of musk to Liuhe soup, or not add musk, just boil the two medicines, strain them, and mix them with Suhexiang pills. </p>
<p>For those who do not feel thirsty but have dry abdominal pain, boiling Liuhe soup and mixing it with Suhexiang pills is especially appropriate. For diarrhea with fever, use Wei-Ling drink. For diarrhea with thirst, use Wei-Ling drink along with the reduced spleen drink.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>For symptoms of both thirst and unrelieved heat, take Tanghua Suhexiang pills, swallowing them with restorative pills; or crush restorative pills into a powder and mix with warm water to swallow. For those already relieved, use Xiangru drink. For cases with exterior-induced fever from a cold, use Liuhe Decoction, Xiangru Decoction, or Xiangru drink. If there is body heat and restlessness, use Wuling Powder, or Xiangru Decoction with a pennyweight of Huanglian. If there&#39;s heat with profuse sweating and a strong aversion to wind, use raw Wuling Powder. If there&#39;s heat and thirst, combine Wuling Powder with Zhi Pizhi drink. </p>
<p>When summer heat attacks internally causing unresolved heat, with symptoms of restlessness and dry mouth, use Chenshi Wuling Powder, or Xiangru drink with a pennyweight of Huanglian. If there is great thirst that doesn&#39;t cease, use Chenshi Wuling Powder, swallowing it with wine boiled with Huanglian pills. </p>
<p>When summer heat attacks internally, causing stabbing pains in the abdomen and difficulty urinating, use raw Wuling Powder combined with seven parts Mu Xiang.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Drinking alcohol in the heat brings summer heat into the intestines. The heat of the alcohol combined with the summer heat leads to fever, intense thirst, and difficult urination, with the urine appearing like blood. Use Wuling San without cinnamon and add a penny of huang lian (coptis). Take Wuling San with the cinnamon and prepare huang lian pills. </p>
<p>If summer heat enters the stomach causing difficulty in urination, add flavored Xiangru drink and also use Sanhuang pills. </p>
<p>If summer heat enters the heart, causing body heat and swelling, one should use Chen Sha Wuling San, or add a penny of huang lian to the Xiangru drink. </p>
<p>For those injured by summer heat and food, symptoms include headache, cold back, spontaneous sweating, fever, aversion to food, nausea, sour odor, and fullness in the chest. Use Liuhe decoction with double the amount of sha ren (galangal seed). </p>
<p>If due to summer heat one drinks cold food, which leads to internal cold injuries, or has external summer heat injuries, this medicine is also suitable. Summer heat primarily affects the heart, which belongs to the south and fire; the summer heat enters according to its kind.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The small intestine is the organ associated with the heart, facilitating the elimination of summer heat toxins through the small intestine. The Five Ling Powder promotes urination and is a treatment for summer heat. </p>
<p>If one is harmed by summer heat and then exposed to the cold while sleeping, that person may experience symptoms of both summer heat and cold, such as spontaneous sweating, aversion to wind, body aches, and headaches. If they feel cold without clothing yet are restless when dressed, they might already have a fever or not. In either case, it is appropriate to add lotus beans and cardamom to Liu He Decoction. In one formula, use patchouli; in another, use perilla, which is the correct treatment. </p>
<p>If one has already been affected by summer heat and then further exposed to wind and cold, or suffers from internal cold damage, both patchouli and perilla can release the exterior, while cardamom and lotus beans can warm the interior. However, for those who experience both summer heat and cold without sweating, it is best to use only the aforementioned medicines.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>If one is affected by the wind, they will inevitably sweat a lot. It is essential to recognize this symptom and to prepare Wuling San, with cinnamon twig as a preferred ingredient. This illness is often prevalent among the common people, frequently occurring when they labor in the heat during the day and sleep with the windows open at night, hoping for coolness. Not covering up leads to unawareness. Those with this condition and experiencing tidal heat, akin to early malaria but not fully developed, should take a mixture of Liuhuo Decoction and Yangwei Decoction in equal parts. </p>
<p>For those who have this condition and experience a runny nose or a hot feeling coming from the nostrils, they should add half a qian of Chuanxiong to Liuhuo Decoction, along with seven fen each of Qianghuo and Huangqin. </p>
<p>If one suffers from heat injury and excessively drinks cold water, resulting in summer heat toxins lingering in the chest, leading to clouded consciousness and inability to speak, they should take Xiangru Decoction or Suhexiang Pill. </p>
<p>For those injured by heat who wash their face with water or bathe, resulting in a clash of summer heat and dampness, causing spontaneous sweating and fever, a feeling of heaviness, and difficulty with urination, Wuling San should be used.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>If one suffers from heat injury and excessive sweating does not stop, severely leading to the depletion of vital essence, it is advisable to urgently collect the sweat. Use a dosage of Wuling Powder with double the amount of Cinnamon, or add Astragalus equal to the amount of Atractylodes. This is also an ancient method.</p>
<p>For sweating due to heat injury, along with cold hands and feet, decoct Liuhuo Decoction to mix with Suhexiang Pill.</p>
<p>If one has sweating due to heat injury, with intermittent twitching of hands and feet, this is known as &quot;heat wind.&quot; This occurs because the body has been harmed by heat, causing pores to open, allowing evil wind to invade. It is advisable to use Xiangru Drink or Xiangru Decoction, and one can add one qian of Qianghuo. If phlegm is abundant, use half a dose of Liuhuo Decoction and half a dose of Hexing Xiang San.</p>
<p>In the hot months, if the body itches like being pricked by needles, with occasional areas of redness and swelling, this is also called &quot;heat wind.&quot; For this condition, mix Liuhuo Decoction with Xiaofeng San, taking it with wine. In cases of heat wind combined with vomiting and diarrhea, use half a dose of Liuhuo Decoction and half a dose of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San, adding three whole scorpions.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>When summer heat accumulates in the upper body, causing chest fullness and obstruction, and when medicinal soups come back up immediately, preventing passage, there may be symptoms of shortness of breath. One can use Liuhe Decoction steeped in cold water, adding a small amount of musk. </p>
<p>For those suffering from vexing summer heat with excessive phlegm, in the Xiaoshu Wan, add two qian of Huanglian powder for a formulation known as Huanglian Xiaoshu Wan. Alternatively, one might use Erchen Decoction or Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction, with an additional one qian of Huanglian. </p>
<p>If summer heat lingers and causes more severe heat internally and externally, leading to restlessness, spontaneous sweating, and great thirst with a preference for cold, one should take Xiangru Drink with one qian of Huanglian, then follow with Baihu Decoction. </p>
<p>If the medicinal treatment yields no improvement, it indicates that the summer heat has deeply penetrated, resulting in a build-up of heat inside, characterized by delirium, unrest, thirst, aversion to clothing, constipation, and discolored urine. This should be treated as a heat illness, seeking medication akin to treating febrile diseases, like with the Tiaoguo Chengqi Decoction or Sanhuang Shigao Decoction. </p>
<p>— Medical Principles by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Heatstroke</p>
<p>When the pulse is weak, the body is hot, and there is spontaneous sweating accompanied by a dislike of cold, this is known as heatstroke. The prescription is Baihu Decoction with Cinnamon. If one drinks cold beverages first and then suffers from heat, the prescription is Wuling Powder. This is certainly accompanied by a sensation of fullness below the heart. Ginger Decoction should be adjusted for consumption, which is favorable; or one can use the Four Gentleman Decoction for adjustment as well. After achieving balance, if there is difficulty in urination or pain in the lower abdomen, one should use three qian of cattail pollen, five qian of talc, and one qian of gingerly licorice. </p>
<p>Moreover, regarding the term &quot;Zei Xie&quot; (thieving evil), I said: &quot;The &#39;Nan Jing&#39; states that there are five evils: real evil, false evil, proper evil, subtle evil, and thieving evil. Those evils that come later are considered false evils; those that come first are considered real evils; those that come from something one cannot overcome are thieving evils; those that come from what one can overcome are subtle evils; and the illness from one&#39;s own constitution is the proper evil.&quot; Furthermore, for instance, in the case of heart disease, heatstroke is the proper evil, while dampness acquired from it is the thieving evil. Now, if the heart first suffers from heat and dampness overcomes it, water conquering fire is something one cannot withstand, hence it is called thieving evil, which among the five evils is the most contrary. The &#39;Nan Jing&#39; states that in damp-heat conditions, Yang is moist and weak, and Yin is small and rapid. The weakness appears in the Yang aspect while dampness interacts with heat. The rapid response appears in the Yin aspect while heat steams up the dampness. Therefore, it is stated that heat and dampness act upon each other, termed damp-heat, which is called thieving evil. </p>
<p>Not only this, I have a chronic issue with stagnant drinking; every time during the hot months, my feet sweat excessively and do not dry. Taking this medicine for two or three doses immediately cures it. For damp-heat with little sweat, Baihu Decoction with Cao Guo; for abundant sweat, Baihu Decoction with Guizhi.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Summer Heat Disease</strong></p>
<p>After the summer solstice, diseases caused by heat are termed &quot;summer heat.&quot; Summer heat is a manifestation of the rising fire. During the summer months, people are affected by it from the mouth, entering and damaging the heart&#39;s protective channels. The pulse may be weak, or either floating and large but scattered, or fine and thin but delayed. This is because the heat damages the qi, leading to its depletion and a weak pulse. Symptoms include sweating, irritability with shortness of breath, excessive talking when calm, body heat with agitation, chest pain, intense thirst, headache accompanied by sweating, fatigue with shortness of breath, or yellowish blood in the stool with rashes; in severe cases, the heat may disturb the heart and spirit, causing loss of consciousness. </p>
<p>To treat summer heat, it is best to clear the heart and promote urination. Since summer heat damages the qi, augmenting the true qi is crucial. There may also be aversion to cold or cold limbs, and in severe cases, confusion or delirium leading to cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, phlegm causing nausea, or abdominal pain with dysentery; these are not due to summer heat harming the body but rather arise from the body&#39;s reaction to summer heat. Because the disease results from summer heat, it is also referred to as summer disease, but the treatment methods differ.</p>
<p>If a traveler or farmer becomes ill from laboring in the midday sun, it is considered an external injury and a yang condition. Such patients are likely to suffer from severe headaches, agitation, heat intolerance, a hot skin sensation, extreme thirst, sweating with an inability to move, indicating that the hot weather has harmed their original qi. The treatment should focus on clearing summer heat and boosting qi, using herbs such as fragrant rush, coptis, hyacinth bean, ginseng, astragalus, five-flavored herb, anemarrhena, and gypsum.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>In hot weather, if one experiences thirst and a weak pulse, it is advisable to use the Baihu Decoction with Ginseng. Use 1.5 qian of ginseng, 2 qian each of licorice and anemarrhena, and 5 qian of gypsum. The Zhuyeshigao Decoction is also effective. Use 1 liang of gypsum, 2.5 qian of pinellia, 2 qian each of licorice and ginseng, and 5 qian of ophiopogon, along with bamboo leaves, and boil in water to take.</p>
<p>If during the hot weather, healthy individuals seek relief from heat and cool themselves in deep halls and cool pavilions with large fans, they attain calmness and experience yin symptoms. This may lead to headaches, chills, stiffness in the body, pain in the limbs and joints, and a feeling of heat without sweating. This is caused by the restraint of yin cold, preventing the yang energy from spreading. It is recommended to use warm and pungent remedies to release the exterior and dispel the cold, using ingredients such as magnolia bark, perilla, dry kudzu, patchouli, notopterygium, and astragalus. If one has already been exposed to cold externally and has also consumed ice water or cold fruits, add dry ginger and cardamom to the previous prescription. This is not to treat heat directly but to address the diseases caused by heat.</p>
<p>If there is no external cold exposure and the issue is simply due to internal injury from cold water or cold items, resulting in abdominal pain or diarrhea, or cholera with vomiting, it is advisable to use the Suoping Decoction. Ingredients include cardamom, wild cardamom, licorice, lentils, dry ginger, and black plum; or modify the Lior Zhong Decoction by adding shenkui, malt, cardamom, and astragalus. This specifically treats internal issues, warming the center and aiding digestion.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>If there are severe symptoms of diarrhea and the pulse is deep and very weak, do not use cooling medicines; instead, use the Fuzi Dazhun Powder, which consists of roasted Fuzi, licorice, dried ginger, apricot kernel, and cinnamon. Alternatively, you can use the Fuzi Lizhong Decoction with added peony root. </p>
<p>(Note: According to Danxi, the cycles of heaven and earth reflect the changing of the five elements, leading to the four seasons; likewise, the five organs and six bowels of humans also follow this pattern. April corresponds to the Fire of the Snake, and May corresponds to the Fire of the Horse, which is overly strong; Fire is the husband of Metal (Lung), thus an excess of Fire leads to a decline of Metal. June corresponds to the Earth of the Sheep, which is too strong; Earth is the husband of Water (Kidney), thus an excess of Earth leads to a decline of Water. Moreover, the Kidney Water often relies on the Lung Metal for nurturing to compensate for its deficiencies. In ancient times, during the summer months, people would sleep alone and eat bland foods to nurture the organs of Metal and Water. The classics state: &quot;He who stores essence in winter does not suffer from warmth in spring.&quot; October corresponds to the Water of the Pig, and November corresponds to the Water of the Rat, when the Fire energy is stored; one must nurture the foundational truth to support the emergence of spring. If during this time one does not indulge in desires and harm oneself, by the time spring arrives, one will be robust and strong, and what illness can one speak of?)</p>
<p>If in the summer there is damage from heat leading to fever, excessive sweating, and loss of strength, where the pulse is weak, thin, and slow, this indicates heat damaging the vital energy. The prescription includes ginseng, honey-fried astragalus, fried lily, white peony root, aged tangerine peel, white poria (each 3 grams), fried yellow jían (2.5 grams), and three grams of berberine, 1.5 grams of white atractylodes, 7 grams of fragrant flat-leaved mint and anemone (mothers of wisdom); decocting with ginger water, to be taken warm before meals.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: Regarding the previous cases, there are those with heat injuring the vital energy causing sweating, those with overexertion injuring the vital energy also causing sweating, and those with pre-existing weakness of the vital energy leading to profuse sweating due to loose pores. Treatment methods: For heat injuring the vital energy, use Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction; for overexertion injuring the vital energy, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for pre-existing weakness of the vital energy with spontaneous sweating, use Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. If there is also night sweats, add Liu Wei Wan with Wu Wei Zi. Previously mentioned large sweating with weakness, pulse weak, thin, and slow, pertains to deficiency of yang qi. Internally, Huang Lian and Zhi Mu may further injure yang qi, while Shao Yao and Fu Ling may harm yin qi, so the practitioner must differentiate accordingly.  </p>
<p>In cases of summer and autumn heat, due to excessive consumption of cold substances like tea and water that injure the insides, combined with overexposure to cold air that injures the outsides, leading to chills and fever, fullness and oppression in the chest, and poor appetite, possibly with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, this is a case of injury from both internal and external cold. The prescription is: Ren Shen, Gan Jiang (stir-fried to purple), Hou Po (stir-fried), Chen Pi, Qiang Huo, Zhi Shi, Bai Fu Ling each 3 grams, Bai Zhu 4.5 grams, Honey-fried Gan Cao 1.5 grams, decoct with ginger water and take warm before meals.  </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For the previously described case, this formula should be used. If it does not respond, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San should be used. If both internal and external cold are resolved but the fever and chills have not subsided, or if appetite remains poor, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction. The &quot;Bao Ming Ji&quot; states: For cholera belonging to the Yang Ming pattern, use combinations like He Zhong, Ping Wei, Jian Zhong Decoction, or Si Jun Zi Decoction.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>When the pulse is floating with spontaneous sweating, add cinnamon twig to the Four Gentlemen formula. If the pulse is floating without sweating, add ephedra. If there is vomiting or loose stools with cramping, and pain on the sides with a wiry pulse, it indicates wood overcoming earth; use Pingwei Powder with papaya, or Jianzhong Decoction with bupleurum and papaya. If there are vomiting, loose stools, abdominal pain, and body heaviness, with a submerged and thin pulse, add white peony and galangal to the Four Gentlemen formula. For vomiting and loose stools with stiffness in the limbs, a submerged and slow pulse belongs to the lesser yin condition; add ginger, aconite, and magnolia bark to the Four Gentlemen formula. For vomiting and loose stools with coldness in the limbs and a faint and slow pulse indicating the jueyin condition, add angelica and aconite to Jianzhong Decoction. If vomiting and a headache with body heat occur, and there is much thirst, use Wuling Powder. If there is coldness and aversion to water, treat with Lizhong Pill. The &quot;Yuanrong&quot; states that for a taiyin condition with cholera, add dried tangerine peel to Lizhong. For vomiting, lower abdominal pain, and coldness in the hands and feet, add熟 aconite to Lizhong. If cramping occurs after vomiting and diarrhea, add fire-roasted gypsum to Lizhong. </p>
<p>If summer heat is encountered during travel, regularly consume to strengthen vital energy, clear heat, and dispel summer heat to prevent heat stroke, cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and other conditions. The formula consists of 1.2 grams of ginseng, 1.5 grams of atractylodes, ten crushed schisandra berries, 2 grams each of ophiopogon (without the heart), fried white peony, and white poria, 0.7 grams each of fried anemarrhena, dried tangerine peel, and fragrant madder, 0.3 grams of fried yellow gip, and 0.5 grams of honey-fried licorice, boiled with ginger water and taken warm before meals.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: According to previous evidence, if a person&#39;s vital energy is weak, it is advisable to use a formula for tonifying energy, removing Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, and adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, or a small amount of fried black Huang Bo; Ren Shen Yi Qi Tang can also be employed. If one encounters fatigue and has overexerted themselves, taking two or three doses of the following formula can prevent internal injuries and fever. This formula focuses on tonifying energy. The ingredients include one and a half qian of honey-fried Huang Qi, one qian each of Ren Shen, Mai Men Dong (with the heart removed), and Chen Pi, one qian of Bai Zhu, seven fen of fried Gan Cao, decocted in ginger and jujube water, to be taken warm before meals. If fatigued severely, add four or five fen of cooked Fu Zi. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: According to previous discussions on revealing the ignorance of the secular world and alleviating endless sufferings. Internally using Fu Zi is especially suitable for those who are typically sensitive to cold food and drink. If someone generally likes cold food and drink, it is also acceptable to substitute with meat桂 (Rou Gui) or fried ginger. If the fatigue is caused by heat injuring energy, leading to tired limbs or numbness in hands and feet, one should first use Ren Shen Yi Qi Tang and then use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. </p>
<p>If a person has overworked their mind with worry, damaging their spirit, experiencing dizziness and blurred vision, with weak heart and shortness of breath, one should primarily tonify blood. The formula includes one qian of Ren Shen, fifteen grains of Wu Wei Zi pounded, one qian each of fried Bai Shao, fried Suan Zao Ren, Fu Shen (with the heart removed), and cured Dang Gui, and five fen each of Gan Cao, Chen Pi, Chuan Xiong, Shao Di Huang (washed with wine), fried Shan Zhi Zi, and Mai Men Dong (with the heart removed), which are to be decocted in water and taken.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The previous diagnosis should use this formula and should not be taken in excess. Ingredients such as Ophiopogon (Mai Men Dong), Peony (Shao Yao), Gardenia (Shan Zhi), and Rehmannia (Sheng Di) are bitter and cold, which may further harm the spleen&#39;s qi. If the spleen and stomach are generally weak and hot and one suffers from the previous symptoms, it is enough to use the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; with Ophiopogon and Five-Flavored Herb. If due to hunger, thirst, or overexertion, leading to high qi and panting, a hot body and agitation, or spontaneous sweating, this indicates internal injury to the yang qi, and the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; should be used. If due to fluctuations in hunger and fullness or improper sweating, resulting in hot, dry muscles, intense thirst, red eyes, flushed face, a large pulse that feels vacuous upon pressing, this indicates blood loss and agitation, and the &quot;Danggui Buxue Decoction&quot; should be used. </p>
<p>Heat resulting from summer heat is due to fire evil harming the heart, consuming the original qi, and causing the evil heat to invade. Thus, it results in excessive sweating, lack of strength, and a weak, slow pulse, which is the external heat evil harming the nourishment and should be treated internally. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In summer, yang qi is predominant externally while yin qi is hidden internally. The principle should be to primarily tonify the yang qi while simultaneously alleviating heat, following the good method of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; of addressing time in accordance with indications. Therefore, in the previous case, one should investigate the cause and treat it accordingly; the indiscriminate use of herbs like Pogostemon (Xiangru) decoction should be avoided, as it can scatter the yang qi, damage the true yin, and worsen the condition.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>In summer, people use mint to brew tea, not realizing that it disperses one&#39;s true vitality, similar to how prolonged use of Chuanxiong soup can lead to sudden death. </p>
<p>Summer ailments caused by heat, although categorized as external influences, are akin to internal injuries and are significantly different from those of cold damage. Cold harms the exterior and obstructs the surface, presenting signs of excess, thus requiring sweating. Heat injures the vital energy, dissipating it and showing signs of deficiency, hence it needs to be replenished. This is what Dongyuan referred to as &quot;clearing heat and benefiting energy.&quot;</p>
<p>There are also cases where excessive consumption of cold substances due to the heat might harm the internal organs, or overexposure to cold air might damage the exterior; these are not injuries from heat but rather sicknesses caused by oneself due to the heat, and should be treated with warming and dispersing herbs or warming herbs that regulate the interior, similar to treatments for cold damage.</p>
<p>During summer, the yang energy rises to the surface, while yin energy sinks within. Overexertion through diet or labor can internally harm the qi, or excessive labor in intense heat can harm the yang energy, leading to numerous ailments. The principle should be to primarily tonify the original qi, supplemented by treatments that dispel heat. If one suffers from heat stroke, it indicates a deficiency of yin-cold, and the principle should be to primarily tonify the yang energy, with a slight addition of heat-dispelling treatments. Therefore, many ancient sages often used ginger, cinnamon, and aconite; this follows the sound principle of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; of treating based on symptoms rather than time.</p>
<p>Today, when faced with heat symptoms resulting in blue or darkened extremities or body parts, this is often due to not understanding the cause or inadequately warming and tonifying the interior, instead relying on the indiscriminate use of fragrant herbs like Banlangen tea. Banlangen tea disperses yang energy and leads the true yin, and if one’s vital energy is already weak or if there has been excessive labor and they use it, it is rarely without danger.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p>
<h3>Introduction to Medicine (Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</h3>
<h4>Distinguishing Between Deficiency and Excess, Yin and Yang</h4>
<p>For summer diseases, when the body is hot with spontaneous sweating, thirst, and a dirty face, other symptoms are secondary changes that may involve internal injury. One must first inquire if the person has a history of deficiency or a weak stomach, or if they suffered from a major illness or exhaustive effort that led to summer heat injury; in such cases, it is advisable to clear summer heat and bolster energy. </p>
<p>If the person is fundamentally strong, robust, and without any signs of deficiency or illness, it is advisable to dispel summer heat and harmonize the middle. </p>
<p>For those residing in high, spacious buildings, if they suffer from what appears to be a heat syndrome related to the heart and spleen meridians, it is termed heatstroke, a yin condition; while those engaged in outdoor activities, experiencing symptoms similar to a cold syndrome related to the bladder meridian, it is termed sunstroke, which is a yang condition; yet in essence, they are the same. </p>
<p>However, when discussing heat exposure, it is referred to as heatstroke, whereas when referring to being pressured by the sun, it is called sunstroke. At the onset of heat, it enters through the mouth, nose, teeth, and cheeks, reaching the palms, thereby producing heat from heat. Hence, ancient methods to dispel summer heat include using cool water for irrigation, though it should not be swallowed. When it enters the liver, it causes dizziness and stiffness; when it enters the spleen, it results in faintness and unawareness; when it enters the lungs, it leads to cough, wheezing, and debilitation; and when it enters the kidneys, it causes excessive thirst, not limited to affecting the heart but impacting multiple organs as well.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Heatstroke and Heat Invasion</strong></p>
<p>Heatstroke brings the heart to a lethargic state, leading to fainting. Heat injury affects the flesh, causing restlessness throughout the body, which may feel like being pricked by needles or experiencing redness and swelling. This occurs because the heat rises above the ground, causing the body&#39;s energy to also rise to the surface of the skin. </p>
<p>When heat invades the stomach and intestines, it results in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. &quot;Hidden heat&quot; refers to heat that has invaded for a long duration and becomes concealed within the three burners of the stomach and intestines, damaging the vital energy without harming the form. Over a period of weeks or months, it may lead to fluctuating cold and heat, resulting in symptoms such as cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, intermittent fevers, thirst, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. However, heat illness often does not involve body pain; if pain does occur, it is likely due to bathing, where moistness and heat conflict.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Wind from Syncope</strong></p>
<p>This refers to the occurrence of heat in the middle and the indication of wind by the twitching of hands and feet, while coldness in the extremities points to syncope. Syncope and the hot syncope from cold damage have similar meanings; one might use Huanglian Xiangru San. Summer wind arises from overexertion, stirring the fire within the five organs, which, when combined with external heat, causes the metal to weaken and wood to flourish, leading to the generation of wind. In this case, Xiangru San may be combined with Qianghuo, or Liuhe Decoction combined with Xiaofeng San. If there is already phlegm and fluids present, and summer heat causes agitation, the combination of Liuhe Decoction and Xingxiang San should be applied. </p>
<p>If a person suddenly collapses on the road and it is not convenient to administer medicine, fearing loss of energy may result in difficulty in treatment, one should urgently support them in a cool place, avoiding damp and cold ground. Heat from the road should be drawn away by placing warm earth on the navel and making openings, encouraging urination over it. Fresh ginger or garlic should be chewed and taken with hot soup or children&#39;s urine. Externally, apply a cloth dipped in hot soup to warm the Qi Hai point, encouraging recovery. </p>
<p>It is particularly important afterward not to drink cold water, but instead take large doses of restorative medicine. For confusion of mind, Wuling San may be used, boiled with lamb&#39;s heart and mixed with powdered cinnabar for oral intake. If sweating occurs, add Huangqi. If someone has been drinking alcohol and heat enters the stomach causing blood in the urine, remove the cinnamon and add Huanglian. If there is confusion, palpitations, and nonsensical speech, use Yiyuan San with an increased amount of cinnabar, mixed with freshly drawn water for dosage. This is essential medicine to lower stomach fire, treat agitation, resolve dampness, and quell thirst.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Heat Toxin and Phlegm Fire</strong></p>
<p>Heat toxin and phlegm fire can obstruct the chest, requiring an assessment of the body&#39;s condition to expel it, signifying that pent-up fire can be released. If there is phlegm, wheezing, shortness of breath, and a feeling of fullness in the chest, and medicines cannot be ingested, urgently prepare Liuhe Decoction blended with two厘 of musk to take. </p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong><br>In summer, people often drink cold water and eat cold food, thus promoting dampness while also aiding in dispersal and transport. For those who sweat excessively, it is advisable to avoid diuretics. To dispel heat, the following are recommended: Xiangru San, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, Qingfei Shengmai San, and Baihu Decoction with ginseng and chuanxiong added. If there is irregular cold and heat, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction. For harmonizing, it is suitable to use Xiao and Da Jiaozhong Decoction, Ruzhu Ling Decoction, Pi Pa Ye San, Weiling Decoction, Gui Ling Ganlu Drink, and Liuhe Decoction. </p>
<p>When there is hidden dampness inside, avoiding heat and craving coolness, while also being assailed by cold air from outside can depress the body&#39;s yang energy; therefore, it is appropriate to resolve this with spicy and warm dispersing remedies like Xianghuo Decoction. If there is exterior cold already received, and internally cold injury occurs, add dried ginger, cardamom, and shenqu. Conversely, if one is exposed to heat from the outside while sustaining internal injuries from cold food, leading to exterior heat and internal cold, use Qing Shu Yiqi Decoction. If there is no external cold but merely internal injury from cold causes abdominal pain and diarrhea, utilize Lizhong Decoction with malt and cardamom; or Da Shun San, or Erqi Dan with cold water; all serve to treat this condition. Inducing heat injury from cold is different from warming and dispersing to treat summer heat. Mistaken consumption can cause jaundice, spotting, accumulation of blood, distress, and death.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>For those suffering internal injuries from labor, or who are inherently weak with deficient qi and blood, particularly in the heat of summer, the primary focus should be on nourishment, and one must be cautious with the use of extremely hot or cold remedies. For those heavily affected by the heat with dark urine, the &quot;Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction&quot; is recommended. For those with mild heat and fatigue, the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; or even pills may be used. During temporary heatstroke, add fragrant plants like &quot;Xiang Ru&quot; and &quot;Bian Dou&quot;. If there is yin deficiency, &quot;Zi Yin Jiang Huo Decoction&quot; or &quot;Shen Qi Pill&quot; should be administered.</p>
<p>Severe heat damages qi. Health practitioners state that indulging in drinking and lust during this season can lead to the internal decay of the kidneys, ultimately resulting in deterioration by autumn and, in severe cases, leading to death by water retention. Regular protection against heat is advised; for those with a strong constitution, &quot;Xiang Ru San&quot; or &quot;Yi Yuan San&quot; may be used, while those with deficiencies should avoid it. It is known that individuals with spleen deficiency need not be overly troubled by summer labor or exposure to cool conditions; they often find themselves with headaches, weakness in the legs, little appetite, and a warm body at the turn of spring to early summer, a condition termed summer illness. The &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; is suitable, omitting &quot;Sheng&quot; and &quot;Chai,&quot; as well as ingredients like &quot;Huang Bo,&quot; &quot;Shao Yao,&quot; &quot;Wu Wei,&quot; and &quot;Mai Dong.&quot; If there is phlegm, add &quot;Ban Xia&quot; and ginger juice. This serves as a sacred remedy for eliminating summer heat.</p>
<p>For those experiencing fatigue, inadequate spirit, thirst, and loss of appetite, &quot;Sheng Mai San&quot; or &quot;Yao Xing Wan,&quot; and universally &quot;Xie Fu Wan Bing Wu You San&quot; are suggested for their efficacy.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Heat is a manifestation of the upward movement of fire. In the summer months, when people are exposed to it, it enters through the mouth and teeth, damaging the heart meridians and collaterals. The pulse may be weak, or it can be floating and large, or stringy, thin, weak, and slow. When heat injures the Qi, the Qi diminishes, leading to a weak pulse. The external symptoms include headache, body heat, dry mouth, thirst, facial greasiness, spontaneous sweating, fatigue, shortness of breath, chills, and aversion to heat. In severe cases, there may be delirium, resulting in cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, phlegm, and inverted flow, alongside yellowing and spots on the skin, all indicative of this condition. In more severe cases, the excess fire overwhelms metal, failing to balance wood, leading to liver excess and convulsions, resulting in a loss of consciousness. The pulse is weak and floating; the floating represents wind and the weak represents summer heat, commonly referred to as summer wind. The recommended treatment is a formula of Huang Lian and Xiang Ru decoction with added Qiang Huo, or simply a Shuang Jie powder with added Xiang Ru.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Generally, the method for treating summer heat should focus on clearing the heart and promoting urination. If there is excessive sweating, one should not promote urination but instead use Bai Hu Tang to clear the heat. Next, treat the exterior and interior accordingly. If it is an exterior condition with headache and aversion to cold, one should use formulas like Shuang Jie San, adding Xiang Ru, or the Ten Flavor Xiang Ru Drink. For a half-exterior, half-interior condition with diarrhea and thirst, along with water regurgitation, use Wu Ling San. If there is severe heat and thirst, use Yi Yuan San to clear it. If both the exterior and interior heat are severe, use Jiedu Tang and Shen Xiong Wan, or wine-steamed Huang Lian. For individuals who are typically weak, or elderly persons suffering from summer heat with weak pulse and diarrhea, and who crave warmth or exhibit syncope, use Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang with half a piece of Fu Zi taken cold. During summer, one must avoid all hot and drying agents. If misused, it can lead to symptoms of jaundice with small urine output, confusion, and possibly death.</p>
<p>When distinguishing between damage from summer heat and cold damage, both present with fever but should be clearly identified. Cold damages the body&#39;s form, while summer heat damages qi. Cold damage is characterized by aversion to cold with a floating and tense pulse, while summer heat exhibits aversion to heat with a weak and faint pulse—this is the difference. The classics state: a strong pulse with cold body indicates cold damage; a weak pulse with hot body indicates summer heat damage. The treatment should involve Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Shi Gao and Zhi Mu, or the use of Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang. In times of excessive rain and dampness coupled with cold, use Cang Zhu Bai Hu Tang. For those whose original qi is weak but suffering from severe damage, use Qing Shu Yi Qi Tang.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Heatstroke</strong></p>
<p>Heatstroke manifests as a weak and suppressed pulse, body heat with a cold back, a dirty face and spontaneous sweating, restlessness and extreme thirst, hair standing on end with a dislike for cold, drowsiness and fatigue without body pain, differing from symptoms of cold damage. If there is internal and external heat, with dry mouth and thirst, limbs slightly cold without body pain, use Baihu Decoction. For phlegm rebellion and aversion to cold, use Orange Peel Decoction. If there is heat and oppression without aversion to cold, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. For headache, nausea and irritability, discomfort in the heart area, and difficulty in urination, use Wuling Powder and Xiaoshu Wan for heat relief. For heatstroke, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is the best. With a thin, slow pulse, open pores and fine hair standing, dry mouth and tongue, use Baihu Decoction with Ginseng. For cholera, restlessness, extreme thirst, abdominal pain, cold limbs, and leg cramping, use Huang Lian and Xiang Ru Decoction. </p>
<p>When suffering from “three yang” heat during summer, the ailment must be heat-related; if the pulse is rapid, modify the Xuming Decoction by removing Aconite, Cinnamon, and Ephedra, and adding Huang Qin, Huang Lian, and Chai Hu. If there is a serious heat spike in summer with headache, irritability, thirst, a cold back, slight sweating, and a weak, deficient pulse, it is called heatstroke, for which cool and refreshing medicines should be used. </p>

<p>It is noted that heat illnesses such as summer heatstroke, heat exhaustion, and heat sickness, though they have different names, are in fact the same condition. If one is harmed by cold in winter and later develops a heat illness in summer, this transforms due to a delayed response, indicating a disease that has moved from the inside to the surface of the body, which is commonly referred to as a late onset. This differs from the acute onset of new heatstroke. It is said that in cases of new heatstroke, the pulse is weak, whereas in cases of late-onset heat illness, the pulse is strong.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Differentiating Between Heat Stroke and Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>Zhang said: &quot;The clear pathogens enter from above, while the turbid pathogens enter from below. Wind, cold, and dampness are all the energies of the earth and are associated with turbid pathogens, which is why they affect the channels of the lower body. Only summer heat is the energy of heaven, associated with clear pathogens, affecting the hand&#39;s lesser yin heart channel. The symptoms often resemble those of cold damage, but the pulse of heat stroke differs from that of cold damage. Although cold damage is characterized by aversion to cold and fever, in its early stages, it does not lead to thirst. In contrast, with heat stroke, thirst arises immediately upon onset, distinguishing it from cold damage. Furthermore, the pulse in cold damage is typically strong and floating, while in heat stroke, it is weak and may be wiry, thin, or slow. The classics state: &#39;A strong pulse with a cold body indicates cold damage; a weak pulse with a hot body indicates heat stroke.&#39; </p>
<p>For instance, if there is a condition resembling yang disease, with rigidity in the neck and back, sweating, and aversion to wind, during the hot summer days, would it not seem similar to heat stroke? However, the absence of thirst differentiates it, thus it is treated with Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang. Regardless of whether one resides in summer or autumn during hot weather, one should carefully follow the texts, for there is no worry of error. </p>
<p>In terms of symptoms, cold damage has aversion to cold, while heat damage has aversion to heat; in terms of pulse, cold damage presents with a strong pulse, while heat stroke shows a weak pulse. Additionally, the weak and thin pulse of heat stroke has some similarities with the pulse of damp constriction, but the symptoms differ. With heat, there is spontaneous sweating and thirst; with dampness, there is no thirst; and with constriction, there is body pain.**<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The pulse is weak and the body is hot due to sunstroke.</p>
<p>Liu Chun stated: According to Scholar Xu, the pulse when harmed by heat is thin, fine, and weak—why is this? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: cold injures the form, while heat injures the qi. Thus, if the qi is harmed but not the form, the qi depletes and the pulse weakens. The terms thin, fine, and weak all refer to a deficient pulse. Zhongjing identified the thin pulse as indicating yin, and Zhu Gong also mentioned that a pulse weak and fine corresponds to sunstroke, confirming that it is indeed a deficient pulse. </p>
<p>Sunstroke resembles the manifestations of heat illness, but in heat illness the pulse is robust, whereas in sunstroke, the pulse is weak; this is the distinguishing factor. Additionally, damp warmth is similar to sunstroke, but the difference lies in the absence of thirst when the body feels cool.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books on Medicine, Volume 232 – Heat Ailments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Heat stroke is the term used for those who suffer from heat illness. According to the &quot;Zuo Zhuan,&quot; it has long been known that people are shaded under trees to avoid heat. In later generations, those who become ill due to movement are said to have heat exhaustion, while those who suffer while at rest are considered to have heat stroke. Thus, can we say that those who suffer from heat while traveling are experiencing it at rest? The terms &quot;movement&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; can only distinguish between external influences and internal injuries. If one becomes ill due to movement, it is an external reaction to the heat of the sun; if one becomes ill due to resting, it is an injury from avoiding the sun’s heat only to suffer from dampness, wind, dew, and the consumption of cold fruits. During the seasons of minor and major cold, those who are affected suffer from cold illnesses; during the minor and major heat seasons, those who are affected suffer from heat illnesses. Laborious people, exposed to cold and heat, are thus more prone to cold and heat-related illnesses. Conversely, those who live in comfort and do not expose themselves to cold or heat through diet and activity invite no such ailments. Therefore, the treatment varies based on food and geography. Individuals with excessive internal dampness are most susceptible to heat stroke, as both external heat and internal dampness interact and cause it.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Therefore, those who are overweight and have excess moisture, during the summer months try many methods to avoid the heat, but if they cannot avoid the moisture in their bodies, they will not be able to escape the heat of the heavens either. The Yiyuan Powder drives out dampness through urination, and taking it in the summer alleviates heat, and this has been known for a long time. However, it is suitable for those whose bodies are full of dampness. For those with a lean and moist-free physique, their bodily fluids are consumed by seasonal changes, and they should use the Shengmai Powder to replenish their fluids. If they use Yiyuan recklessly to promote urination, they will deplete their lower sources, leading to dryness and deprivation. Moreover, the dampness induced by summer heat often coexists with underlying cold in overweight individuals, which can lead to severe symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, cold sweats, and life-threatening conditions. Relying solely on Yiyuan Powder to relieve heat and drive out dampness often exacerbates the situation, ultimately compromising organ function. Is it not crucial to discern its use with care? Furthermore, whenever there is excessive sweating, one should avoid promoting urination. This is vital, as the only bodily fluids in the stomach are this moisture. Once it leaks out and flows downward, it can be termed an approach that leads to depletion. Zhongjing referred to this condition as &quot;no yang,&quot; and if their pulse is short, rapid, and weak, that indicates a departure from vitality. Sudden heatstroke can lead to collapse and loss of consciousness, commonly referred to as &quot;heat wind.&quot; There are typically two pathways: one is the presence of phlegm.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>In ordinary times, phlegm accumulates, filling the meridians. Once subjected to intense heat, phlegm obstructs the qi, leading to sudden drooling; this is the most severe manifestation of humid heat disease. It is advisable to first induce vomiting to expel the phlegm, then clear the heat, which is relatively easier to manage. In cases of deficiency, it is a deficiency of yang. When the yang qi is weak and inert over time, while yin cold has long been in effect, upon suddenly encountering intense heat, the evil harmonizes with this deficiency, which is how humid heat disease arises from deficiency and cold. It is best to use warming medicines that also clear the heat, which is the most difficult to address. Danxi stated: &quot;Fire transforms gold into molten stone; what is there of cold?&quot; This assertion seems overly one-sided and cannot avoid mistakes in two or three out of ten cases. Just as the snow atop Mount Emei has never melted, how can it be said that all temples are hot in summer due to this misconception? In the human body, if there is accumulated yin to the extent that even boiling water cannot warm it, how is this different? The Inner Canon states: &quot;Seek what is lacking, and hold accountable what is deficient.&quot; This shows that we must not only seek and hold accountable for what is present and real. In my humble opinion, the Dahuang Long Wan can effectively revive those who have fainted due to heat stroke; isn’t that an example? There are also those with middle qi deficiency caused by emotional distress, where the qi is stagnant without phlegm; in such cases, Suhe Xiang Wan is advised for treatment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Scholar Xu said: This condition features a violent reversal of qi, yet it will quickly recover on its own. Even without medication, it can heal; however, afterward, it is advisable to clear away the summer heat. In summer, the yang of the human body leaks out through sweat, while the yin is consumed internally due to heat, resulting in a deficiency of both yin and yang. Zhongjing prohibited the use of sweating, purging, and warming needles in cases of draught illnesses because sweating harms the yang, purging injures the yin, and warming needles provoke internal heat, hence their ban. Instead, treatment focuses solely on using sweet and cold medicines that nourish fluids, protect the lungs, bolster the yang, and enrich the yin. The relationship between these factors is crucial, which is why I have highlighted this. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When both yin and yang are deficient, replenishing yang exhausts yin, while draining yin leads to the loss of yang. This means that yang relies on yin as its home, so when replenishing yang, one must not harm yin; conversely, yin depends on yang as its root, so draining yin must not disrupt yang. When both yin and yang are deficient, one must be cautious about supplementation and draining; any efforts risk leaning too much toward one side, like an excess of yin or yang, resulting only in minute discrepancies. Therefore, excessive use of sweet and warm substances risks transgressing the caution against replenishing yang, while excessive bitter and cold substances could violate the caution against draining yin. However, when using a combination of sweet and cold—medications that do not favor either yin or yang—one can effectively clear and resolve summer heat. Thus, this has been the foundation for generations. In summer, sudden collapse and loss of consciousness is termed a summer wind.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The heart&#39;s fire is exceedingly violent, and the heat of summer acts upon it, causing choking discomfort, obscuring one&#39;s awareness. However, there are other organs that may be weak and vulnerable, and when they are deeply affected by heat, they do not react as robustly as the heart. If the heat enters the liver, it causes dizziness and stubborn obstruction; if it enters the spleen, it leads to drowsiness and unawareness; if it enters the lungs, it results in panting and weakness; and if it enters the kidneys, it leads to excessive thirst. </p>
<p>Both supplementation and cooling must be administered, but one must first ascertain which organ is involved, so that the treatment can be properly aligned. Those who labor in the heat at midday and are affected by the summer heat should be treated to cool and eliminate the heat toxins using methods such as Bai Hu Decoction, Yi Yuan Powder, Huang Lian Xiang Ru Drink, and San Huang Shi Gao Decoction, all of which can be employed.</p>
<p>For those who reside in spacious buildings, are enveloped by cool breezes, eat raw and cold foods, and suppress their yang but fall ill from heat, all methods for treating summer heat and cooling should not be applied indiscriminately. If there is no sweating, one must still facilitate the surface to release the yang; if there are urgent symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, one must harmonize and relieve internally; in severe cases, it is advisable to use warm medicines sparingly for further treatment. Thus, in treating summer heat-induced disorders characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, the primary focus should be on treating the summer heat; for those avoiding the heat who experience similar symptoms, the main approach should be to harmonize and warm the interior, making it essential to differentiate between the two.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>During the Yuanfeng era, the Harmony and Medicinal Bureau was established, gathering the experience of physicians, particularly detailed on the subject of heat stroke. In the summer months, due to heat-related conditions, extensive trials and observations were conducted. They employed a modified Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction, which did not directly treat the heat but rather addressed the dampness; additionally, a formulation of Banxia and Fuling with a little licorice was created, named Xiaoshuwan, indicating that cooling down the symptoms was indeed about dispelling dampness, making this reasoning sound.</p>
<p>Their Xiangru Drink primarily consisted of Xiangru, Cowpea, and Houpu; if heat was excessive, Cowpea was removed and Huanglian was added as the chief herb to treat heart fire; if dampness was excessive, Huanglian was removed and Fuling and licorice were added to combat spleen dampness. For the Squeeze Spleen Drink, since the spleen is affected by excessive dampness becoming congested, it was supplemented with Cowpea, Kudzu root, and licorice, along with Wumei, Sharen, and Caoguo to invigorate the spleen and eliminate its unwanted dampness; in severe cases, Dazun Powder and Laifu Dan were used to treat cases of heat stroke characterized by excessive diarrhea, aligning with the intent of squeezing the spleen.</p>
<p>As for the Loquat Leaf Powder, it was used to address the stomach being overtaken by dampness, leading to turbidity. Hence, they included Xiangru, Loquat leaves, Clove, and Baimaoxiang for their aromatic qualities to soothe the stomach and eliminate any foul odor; in severe cases, they employed Cold Fragrance Drink to treat instances of heat stroke characterized by excessive vomiting, which also aligned with the principles of Loquat Leaf Powder.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The physician, when treating conditions of heat, dampness, deficiency, cold, shallow, deep, slow, or rapid, should carefully consider and apply remedies; the benefits are extensive. Later scholars continued to build upon this by addressing deficiencies. The &quot;Gui Ling Gan Lu Drink&quot; from Hejian, along with Wu Ling and San Shi medications, aims to generate bodily fluids to help with stomach deficiency. Zi He’s &quot;Gui Ling Gan Lu Powder&quot; contains ginseng, kudzu root, licorice, patchouli, and amomum, which not only strengthens deficiencies but also eliminates turbidity; some use the &quot;Shi Wei Xiang Rou Drink&quot;, enhancing the five flavors in the &quot;Jufang&quot; with added ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and papaya, to strengthen deficiencies and eliminate damp heat. Moreover, Dongyuan’s &quot;Qing Shu Yi Qi Soup&quot; and &quot;Ren Shen Huang Qi Soup&quot; also replenish the body and support immunity to eliminate damp heat, which is especially crucial for those who are internally weak and pale, regardless of whether they have suffered from heatstroke; these should be taken frequently. Heatstroke typically manifests as agitation and a feeling of heat and heaviness; Dongyuan devised a remedy called &quot;Qing Zao Soup,&quot; modeled after Zhang Zhongjing’s &quot;Zhu Ye Shi Gao Soup&quot;, focusing primarily on eliminating dampness. Dryness opposes dampness, and so the aim of dispelling dampness is paramount, demonstrating that Dongyuan possesses exceptional knowledge in this regard.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Moreover, just as the Yiyuan powder expels dampness, adding cinnabar also removes heat; the Wuling powder expels dampness, while adding ginseng benefits deficiency and reducing cassia by adding cinnabar removes heat; in addition, Baihu decoction with ginseng benefits deficiency, and adding angelica wins against dampness. Combined with the &quot;Jufang,&quot; it is quite comprehensive, yet it is still lacking in certain aspects. The observation of heatstroke resembles a stroke, and one cannot treat it through the channels of the wind. Although the &quot;Baiyi Xuanfang&quot; has the Dahuang Long Wan, it was not initially intended for heatstroke. I tentatively commend it, saying: for those who faint due to heat, administering it will provide relief, thus it can be used to address heatstroke to some extent. If a person has already depleted Yin and blood, and the heat poison penetrates deeply into the blood, advancing with this pill could certainly lead to peril. The &quot;Liangfang&quot; also has the Diyi powder to treat those who are in a stupor from heatstroke and are on the brink of death, but it employs common cooling blood medications to clear the heat-affected blood. There is nothing better than this. Later, having used it effectively multiple times, it was praised with the name &quot;Pohuo powder.&quot; How insightful! For the celestial fire in the center of heaven flows like molten gold and shines like stone; this can extinguish it, further illustrating that the heatstroke is caused by excessive heart fire, boiling and depleting Yin blood. Other than clearing the heart and cooling the blood, there is nothing else that can be done. In reviewing various prescriptions and detailing them, more detail is added for clarity.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>On the Treatment of Summer Heat in the &quot;Jinkui&quot; with Two Formulas: Baihu Jiajinshen Decoction and Guati Decoction</p>
<p>In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; there are two formulas for treating summer heat: one is Baihu Jiajinshen Decoction, which primarily addresses the heat caused by the intense summer. The excessive heat can disturb and injure the lung&#39;s metal element, depleting its fluids, and this formula is used to preserve the lung&#39;s metal element and its fluids. The Shengmai Powder by Sun Simiao and the Qingshu Yiqi Decoction by Li Dongyuan also have their roots in this. The other formula is Guati Decoction, which mainly treats dampness. During summer, the pervasive humidity can exacerbate heat, also injuring the lung&#39;s metal element, leading to excess moisture accumulating beneath the skin.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The skin is the counterpart of the lungs, used to contain the moisture within the chest. When it is expelled or released, the lung qi is unblocked, and the moisture between the skin can descend. Why do later scholars only focus on Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Wuling Powder? Take for example Hejian&#39;s Tongling Powder and Zihe&#39;s Guiling Ganlu Drink; they are clearly intended to guide dampness and alleviate summer heat. Whether extending the principles of the Guiti Decoction for treating upper burner damp-heat and clearing lung metal, there are indeed no other formulas. Thus, I specifically mention two formulas and discuss their meanings: when unseen heat injures lung metal, White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng is used to rescue it; when tangible dampness injures lung metal, Guiti Decoction is used to rescue it. Each has its own focus. These two formulas are not recorded in the chapter on cold-induced spasm due to damp heat in &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot; but appear again in the chapter on spasm due to damp heat in &quot;Jinkui Yao Lue.&quot; Recognizing the subtle yet critical distinctions is essential.</p>
<p>Regarding White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng, the text states: when there is internal heat in the Taiyang stage, this is termed &quot;heat stroke.&quot; The person sweats and feels cold, has a fever and thirst; White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng is indicated. Indeed, those who sweat and feel cold in summer have a deficiency of the defensive qi. Fever and thirst indicate that lung metal has been dried out by the fire&#39;s control. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; says: when the heart transfers heat to the lungs, it causes dryness in the diaphragm. This state also leads to thirst. The heart fire affecting the lung metal is associated with the Taiyang pattern but differs from treating cold exposure in winter. Using this decoction to rescue lung metal is the fundamental principle.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Gua Ti Decoction. This text states: In the case of a hot sensation in the middle (of the body), accompanied by bodily heat and heavy pain, along with a weak pulse, this results from summer&#39;s cold water damaging, causing water to flow within the skin. Gua Ti Decoction is indicated for this condition. Transform the powder into a decoction, removing red adzuki beans and sour jiaogulan, and solely using Gua Ti to prepare and take as a decoction. This will expel the water from the chest, and thus the water within the skin can also be eliminated. There is the meaning of discharge in &quot;expel,&quot; leading to sweat as a result, and no longer will water seep between the skin. This corresponds to the &quot;Neijing,&quot; where water fills sweat, leading to a lack of sweating. Zhang Zhongjing understood this concept, stating that middle heat also involves middle dampness, which has a relation. However, if water moves in the skin, why is the pulse seen as weak? It is because the middle heat pulse is originally weak, and dampness resides in the skin, internally connecting with the lungs, obstructing the flow of nutrients and defenses, causing the pulse to appear even weaker. The heat pulse is weak, pressing down reveals no strength; the damp pulse is weak, raising it is unbeneficial; thus, the pulse resulting from the combination of dampness and heat is also unbeneficial in both raising and pressing.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>To remove the water and promote circulation, the movement of lung energy is important. If the fingers are nimble and then become wet, it indicates a need to eliminate moisture. If pressing reveals strength, it suggests a need to relieve heat. Even a small object can have remarkable and swift effects.</p>
<p>Moisture travels within the skin; during summer, it may come from excess cold water intake or from dousing with cold water after sweating, leading to moisture accumulation in the skin, obstructing outward flow of yang energy. This causes symptoms of heat and heaviness in the body. Using a gourd stem can drive away this moisture, allowing yang energy to circulate and relieving the condition.</p>
<p>In general, consuming cold drinks injures the lungs, and the damage accumulates over time. This moisture mainly harms the skin associated with the lungs, so addressing it effectively requires only a small adjustment rather than relying heavily on red adzuki beans or sour jujube water. It is clear that prolonged exposure to cold, especially from wind, rain, and dew, can obstruct the upward flow of yang from the upper body, while moisture from the earth can further impact the lower body. Thus, treatments differ based on whether to enhance urination or not. Is there any need for further differentiation?<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Bian Mai (Differentiating Pulse)</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of heat injury, as stated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; is described as weak with a body heat resulting from heat injury. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; says that heat injures the qi without affecting the physical body, which is why the pulse is weak. However, the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states that the pulse is floating, large, and scattered, indicating something yet to happen. Floating, large, and scattered pulses are fundamental to the heart&#39;s pulse, not indicative of illness. Zhongjing did not speak of this, but only addressed its unevenness, stating it is thin, wiry, and slow. The thin, wiry pulse corresponds to the response of qi injured by heat. The pulse flowing through the skin as water is said to be weak and shows the pulse retained by water and dampness, with yang qi not flowing. Generally, it is referred to as &quot;weak.&quot; In detail, it is described as thin, wiry, slow, and weak. It is not the case that the floating, large pulse mixes into the weak pulse, which would be called the pulse of illness due to heat, raising concerns about the surrounding issues!<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>In treating heat stroke, if one does not distinguish between external causes and internal injuries, and only follows established formulas without considering activity and rest, the physician is at fault. In cases of cold disorders combined with heat, mistakenly using Yang Dan decoction leads to syncope. In cases of heat stroke with cold, mistakenly using Xiangru decoction results in throat obstruction. The later sages, by adding ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and papaya to Xiangru decoction to address internal injuries, indeed had good insights. However, those who do not differentiate between symptoms cause errors; can we stop here? </p>
<p>In treating heat stroke, failing to address the dampness is a physician&#39;s error. Heat steams the dampness, leading to heat stroke; without dampness, it is merely dry heat, not heat stroke. Thus, overweight individuals with excess dampness frequently suffer from heat stroke, while thin individuals with excess fiery conditions frequently suffer from heat illnesses.</p>
<p>When treating heat stroke, if the patient does not sweat, one must prioritize inducing sweating. If one only clears the interior without addressing the exterior, it is a physician&#39;s fault. Heat stroke should always result in profuse sweating; if there is no sweat, it is either due to water and dampness holding the person back or wind and cold obstructing. In such cases, one should first disperse the exterior pathogens, then induce sweating before clearing the interior.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>If one does not first resolve the external cause, then the cooling measures will not be effective enough and it may lead to conditions like intermittent fever and dysentery, causing endless troubles. </p>
<p>In treating heatstroke, one must not recklessly administer warming tonics, as this causes the summer pathogen to penetrate deeply, aggravating the blood and becoming a fault of the physician. </p>
<p>Heat harms the qi, leading to fatigue and shortness of breath that resembles deficiency. Thus, one should combine cooling measures for summer heat with those that boost qi. Those who do not understand may mistakenly apply warming tonics, allowing the summer pathogen to invade the blood, resulting in bleeding and dysentery, which may worsen in the harsh winter without relief. Therefore, mistaking heat for warmth in treatment carries endless harm.</p>
<p>Damp warmth is a febrile illness resulting from the combination of summer heat and dampness. Pre-existing dampness can invite summer heat inside. When both legs feel cold, and there is abdominal fullness, dampness has revealed its cold nature under the influence of heat. If it enters the chest, it causes headaches and distress, leading to nonsensical speech; the summer heat combined with dampness exhibits its heat.</p>
<p>At such times, one should only focus on resolving the combined evil of heat and dampness, thereby extinguishing its flames. It is better to induce sweating than to allow the two evils to merge into one. During sweating, one may be unable to speak, hear, or recognize distress, but their complexion becomes blue and their appearance changes, revealing the problem externally. If severe sweating occurs followed by critical condition, it is not a true or false comparison, but rather a matter of life and death for the patient in the hands of the physician.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>On Verification</strong></p>
<p>Heat illness originates from the heat of summer. However, there are those who suffer from heat stroke and those who become ill due to heat, resulting in different kinds of illnesses, all ultimately due to heat. Therefore, there are two kinds of illnesses: yin heat and yang heat, which must be treated differently, much like ice and fire. Those who seek to eliminate heat may inadvertently suffer from cold. </p>
<p>If people fear heat and crave coolness without avoiding cold drafts, they may find themselves in deep halls or under shady trees, or during times when it’s both hot and cold, not being careful with their clothing. This can lead to cold pathogens invading the surface of the body, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, chills without sweating, stiff body, and aching limbs. This condition, caused by cold exposure in summer, is labeled as yin heat, corresponding to wind-cold disease. The main treatment should focus on warming and dispersing, using methods for treating wind-cold.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases of negligence concerning diet, overindulging in raw and cold foods, leading to chills that harm the organs, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. This is also due to heat leading to cold, but with cold pathogens present internally; therefore, treatment should primarily focus on warming the center, which also belongs to yin heat. </p>
<p>Yang heat, on the other hand, refers to illnesses caused by excessive heat exposure.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>In the case of Zhongjing, it is referred to as &quot;zhong re&quot; (middle heat). Generally, during the peak of summer&#39;s intense heat, whether on long journeys or in the fields, when one does not shy away from labor, the excessive heat can injure the yin, leading to symptoms such as headache, irritability, high fever, intense thirst, profuse sweating, floating pulse, and possibly breathlessness or an inability to move. This is named &quot;yang shu&quot; (yang heat) because the heat occurs in the summer months. The treatment should focus on discerning the vacuity or solidity of the qi, and the mildness or severity of the fire, either supplementing or clearing to stabilize the qi. This is very different from the treatment of &quot;yin shu&quot; (yin heat). If one only considers the concept of heat and neglects to differentiate between exterior and interior, and does not understand yin and yang, it will lead to serious mistakes.</p>
<p>Yin heat symptoms may occur either superficially or internally, mostly found in wealthy and comfortable individuals. This often arises from indulging in emotions without restraint, making them susceptible to wind and cold. Yang heat symptoms mostly afflict those engaged in hard labor, resulting from direct exposure to summer heat, often beyond their capacity to endure. However, the heat of summer can be avoided, and those who are cautious tend to evade it, leading to fewer cases. In contrast, cold can invade without notice, and since many are unaware, they may easily fall victim to it. Therefore, among those who suffer from summer heat, cases of yang heat are rare, while yin heat constitutes eight or nine out of ten.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Nowadays, when people treat heatstroke, they merely observe symptoms like fever and headaches, and they must conclude that it is heatstroke, using only cooling methods, which shows a great lack of understanding. </p>
<p>The illness caused by cold, although it originates from the same cold pathogen, is named differently. Similarly, although &quot;heat injury&quot; stems from the same heat pathogen, the diseases differ. The names for cold injuries differ: in winter’s cold, it is called true cold injury; in the warmth of spring, it is called warm disease; and in summer’s heat, it is termed heat disease. Warm disease and heat disease are simply different names for cold injury. The classic texts state: &quot;In winter, one is injured by cold; in spring, one will surely fall ill with warmth.&quot; It is also said: &quot;Any illness caused by cold that turns into warmth, if it occurs before the summer solstice, is warm disease; if after, it is heat disease.&quot; This is the distinction made.</p>
<p>Heat injury also has differences: if one is impacted by heat and subsequently feels cold, that cold injures the body, thus it is cold injury. If one is affected by heat and then suffers from heat, that heat injures the qi, thus it is heat injury. This refers to injuries from within or affects from without, but there are simply different types of heat disease. The texts state: &quot;If the qi is strong but the body is cold, it arises from cold injury; if the qi is weak but the body is hot, it arises from heat injury.&quot; This is the explanation.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>When the body&#39;s qi is abundant but the body is cold, it means the body is afflicted by cold pathogens while the qi remains intact; hence it is called &quot;cold injury.&quot; When the qi is weak but the body is hot, it indicates overheating that injures the qi; thus it is termed &quot;heat injury.&quot; Many people do not understand this point and mistakenly believe that cold injury must always involve a cold body, which is logically inconsistent and greatly misinterprets the texts.</p>
<p>In the summer months when the heat is intense, one must ensure that the body has a slight sweat, as this is the most appropriate way to nourish the body during this season. If one insists on being completely dry without sweating, it tends to result in an excess of yin over yang, leading to various illnesses. Observing the classics, it is stated: &quot;Heat should be accompanied by sweating; do not suppress it.&quot; This indicates that sweating during heat should not be hindered. It is also stated: &quot;If sweating does not occur during summer heat, it will lead to autumn&#39;s wind and fever.&quot; This highlights that a lack of sweating during summer heat can be a disease. Thus, the appropriateness of sweating in the summer can be understood.</p>
<p>There are eight signs of heatstroke: weak pulse, spontaneous sweating, body heat, coldness in the back, facial dirtiness, restlessness and thirst, slightly cold hands and feet, and a feeling of heaviness in the body. In treating these conditions, it is crucial to prioritize the regulation of the original qi, followed by clearing and benefiting.</p>
<p>In cases of heatstroke resulting in death, one should not allow exposure to cold; doing so can be fatal. It is preferable to use warm substances to protect the abdomen and treat the condition slowly.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treating Yin Heat Disorders</strong></p>
<p>In the hot months, if one is externally affected by wind and cold, it can lead to the suppression of Yang Qi by Yin evil, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff and painful limbs, lack of sweating, aversion to cold, and a tense pulse. These are related to the category of cold damage, and the treatment should primarily focus on dispersing and resolving the condition, using formulas such as Xiao Chai Hu Tang or similar variations like Yi Er San Si Chai Hu Yin, adapting for cold-heat and deficiency-excess as appropriate.</p>
<p>If the pulse is seen as weak and subtle, with a weak energy not suitable for sweating, one should focus on tonifying the central Qi to gradually restore the primal energy, allowing the cold evil to disperse without direct attack on it. One may also use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for this. If the exterior is affected by evil while there is intense internal heat, or severe Yangming heat, then formulas such as Chai Hu Bai Hu Jian should be employed.</p>
<p>If the cold evil has not yet resolved on the surface, with the six pulses feeling weak and tight, a cold back, aversion to cold, or symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea without internal heat, this indicates that true Yin is concealed within, and the evil is not easily resolved. Even during the hot months, immediate gentle warming of the center is warranted; formulas like Li Yin Jian, Li Zhong Tang, Da Wen Zhong Yin, and Ma Gui Yin should be used promptly, without hesitation or delay.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>If evil excesses from the outside manifest, yet the interior is not greatly deficient, one may use the Five Accumulations Powder. For the above symptoms that cannot all be addressed, one should observe and treat according to the principles of the harmful cold category. </p>
<p>As for internal injuries caused by cold, resulting in stomach qi depletion and symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, the primary treatment should involve warming the middle and dispersing cold. If one has just been exposed to cold evil, with stagnation not yet relieved and the spleen’s qi not deficient, one should primarily use suppressive and supportive decoctions like the Suppressive Brew and the Five Virtues Pills. If the stomach qi is slightly deficient, it is advisable to supplement with the Guanyuan Decoction and the Five Virtues Pills. If the stomach qi is severely deficient, one should focus on the Warming Stomach Drink and the Regulate the Middle Decoction. If vomiting and diarrhea are severe, with both the spleen and kidneys injured, resulting in pain radiating to the lower abdomen or even dysentery, the Warming Stomach Guanyuan Decoction, the Regulate the Yin Decoction, or variations like the Nine Qi Pill should be used. </p>
<p>If there is cold evil in the exterior, causing internal cold injuries, leading to illness both in the exterior and interior, it is necessary to treat both aspects, using the Harmony Stomach Drink with Bupleurum or a warm stomach drink with Bupleurum, or newly formulated Bupleurum drinks, while carefully examining the deficiency or excess. If ancient formulas like the Great Harmony Powder are employed as a general treatment for warming the middle, they are certainly not adequate alone.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treating Summer Heat</strong></p>
<p>Severe heat can harm a person, deriving from heat symptoms; however, within Yang, there are also Yin and Yang, which must be distinguished. Generally, those suffering from summer heat tend to have a deficiency of Qi, as fire can undermine metal, and heat damages Qi. It is essential to clear heat and to replenish deficiency. For those who are predominantly Yang within Yang, they should also be treated with clearing methods. Symptoms like body heat, headache, irritability, intense thirst, profuse sweating, and a rapid, slippery pulse, accompanied by a preference for cold water, dry stools, and painful, red urine, all indicate Yang symptoms. If the Qi is not significantly deficient but there are just fiery symptoms, one should consider White Tiger Decoction or Yiyuan Powder. If the heat is very intense, Jade Spring Powder would be even better. If sweating occurs with a weak pulse, thirst is present, and there is fire with scant Qi, White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng or Zhang Jing&#39;s Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction, or drinks like those in &quot;Xuanning&quot; with cinnamon, Poria, and sweet dew should be considered. If dizziness and shortness of breath occur, though thirst is present and fire isn’t too severe, Sheng Mai Powder should be used. The methods mentioned above for treating Yang within Yang are all from ancient wisdom. However, if there is intense heat and thirst, yet a weak and powerless pulse, or if pressing down produces no response, along with a feeling of weakness and rapid breathing, this indicates a deficiency of Spleen and Stomach Qi and insufficient original Yang. This is a false fire condition; mistakenly using White Tiger or similar formulas could lead to a critical situation.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>On Treating Hidden Yin in Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>In cases of heatstroke, people usually recognize it as a manifestation of Yang, but they fail to understand that there is Yin within Yang. When there is external heat afflicting the body along with internal heat, both exterior and interior are hot, which is indeed a Yang condition, treated appropriately with clearing and tonifying methods as described earlier. However, if there is no internal heat originally, but injury to Qi due to heat, resulting in Qi deficiency within, then there are signs of hidden Yin. Thus, in treating symptoms of heatstroke, it is most important to distinguish between Yin and Yang, deficiency and excess. If the pulse is weak and without strength, or if there are symptoms like aversion to cold, chills in the back, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea, or if the limbs and the tips of the nose feel slightly cold, or a disinclination for cool tea or cold water, or shortness of breath with weakness upon movement, all these are signs of Yin within Yang. In such cases, the best approach is to focus on preserving the vital energy, specifically using Shenqi Decoction slowly with it. If there are also mild nausea and chills, ginger should be added in equal measure with ginseng. In more severe cases, one should apply nourishing decoctions, middle-regulating decoctions, Five Gentleman Decoction, Five Fortune Drink, or Decoctions for regulating Yin, all of which should be used as appropriate.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>If the excess of cold and emptiness is severe, then one must rely on suitable remedies regardless of the time. Both cinnamon and goji berries are essential. It is crucial not to use cold and cooling agents just because of the heat, which could further harm the yang energy and lead to unpredictable consequences. In the summer months, if one is overly fatigued during intense heat and suffers from heatstroke, their fatigue has already harmed the spleen, and the heat further damages the energy. This is fundamentally a case of internal injury with great emptiness, so one should prioritize nourishment and then check for the presence of fire or evil, treating accordingly as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>In summer, illnesses caused by heat can occur, and if a physician unknowingly uses cold remedies without recognizing hidden yin, it may lead to vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or external heat with internal cold, along with irritability and thirst. These symptoms can resemble a cold illness, but if one observes a weak pulse and spiritual fatigue, it indicates a condition of excessive yin countering yang; hence, warming remedies should be promptly applied to rescue the internal state.</p>
<p>In summer, if heat has been harmed and cold has likewise harmed the body, in cases of external heat with internal cold, the focus should be primarily on addressing the internal cold. If there is stagnation, one should clear the obstruction; if there isn’t, one should augment the energy. Warming the center and regulating the spleen will restore the spleen energy, allowing the heat to dissipate completely.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>On the Hidden Yin in Summer Months</strong></p>
<p>The hidden Yin during the summer months is a principle of the natural ebb and flow of Yin and Yang in the world. However, Danxi has specifically addressed this issue yet has interpreted it contrary to its true meaning, leading people to doubt its essence. What does he mean? He discusses that humans share a connection with Heaven and Earth. In the first month (Zi), Yang is born, and it begins to move; in the third month (Yin), three Yangs are born, and Yang first emerges from the ground. This represents the rising energy. In the sixth month (Si), six Yangs are born, and Yang fully emerges above, signifying the floating energy. The human abdomen corresponds to the Earth&#39;s energy and at this time, it floats at the surface of the skin, dispersing into the dermis, rendering the abdomen empty.</p>
<p>People say that the hidden Yin is within during the summer months, and this notion of Yin implies emptiness. If one interprets it merely as coldness, it leads to significant misunderstandings. Moreover, during this period, Yang is abundant above ground, burning and scorching, flowing like molten gold and dazzling like stone; how can there be anything cold or Yin? If one carelessly introduces warmth during the summer, can they avoid the troubles of an imbalance between reality and illusion? Danxi&#39;s mention of emptiness is indeed correct. However, treating coldness as a misconception while also prohibiting warmth in summer is something I cannot accept.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>How can this be understood? The way of heaven and earth relies on yin and yang. The transformations of yin and yang are based on growth and decline. Thus, when one comes, another departs; when one rises, another falls, and the mechanisms of creation are mutually concealed for utility. The classics say: Yin governs cold, and yang governs heat. It also states: Qi that is abundant is hot, while qi that is deficient is cold. This is the fundamental nature of yin and yang. Now, since it is said that in summer the yang floats outside, then the yin must be hidden within. When yin is strong, yang is weak; how can it not be cold? When yang floats outside, qi is deficient inside; how can it not be cold? This is a principle that is inherently unchanging. However, what is even more evident can be seen in the water of wells and springs: during the harsh cold of three winters, the well water is warm; during the scorching heat of midsummer, the spring water is cold. Is this not a clear example of external cold and internal heat, or external heat and internal cold? This holds true year after year and represents the constant seasons of qi. Beyond the primary qi, there are also foreign qi, with heaven set in five phases and earth equipped with six, where cold and warmth alternate and qi changes correspondingly.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Just as the record of the cold and clear during the伏明 period has been frequently noted; the record of wind and cold during the卑监 period has also risen; the record of the sun&#39;s energy in conjunction with the control of yin and its transformation during the坚成 period; and the record of cold influencing the transformation of things during the流衍 period, when heaven and earth become solemn and still; the sun governs heaven, and cold air descends, bringing forth cold and clear times; the moon governs heaven, hiding the yin within the earth, leading to great cold, etc. This means that regardless of winter or summer, there exist unseasonal energies that provoke ailments among the people. Moreover, should we claim that due to the fire of summer months, there is no cold, and thus prohibit the use of warmth? The principle of伏阴 (hidden yin) essentially refers to the interplay of yin and yang in relation to cold and heat; if one were to merely treat the word &quot;cold&quot; as void, then in summer, hidden yin would imply many void syndromes, while in winter, with hidden yang, there would be none remaining—could it be so? Further, if in summer, warmth should be prohibited, then in winter, cold should equally be banned—this is simply self-evident. </p>
<p>Now, observing the ailments across the four seasons, it is clear that in midsummer there are often many cases of vomiting and diarrhea, while in the depths of winter, rashes and sores are particularly evident. Such conditions—are they not due to an excess of internal heat in winter and an abundance of middle cold in summer? In summary, in summer there are heat syndromes and also cold syndromes; in winter there are excess syndromes and also void syndromes. Although treatment should vary based on the season and symptoms, it is critical to adapt according to the illnesses encountered. However, the principle of伏阴 in summer truly reflects the synchrony of heaven and humanity, being the original mechanism of disease that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>If we consider the arguments of Danxi, they contradict the principles of reasoning; what relevance do they have to practice? Even without these arguments, what harm is there? Recently, I saw Xu Donggao also discussing Danxi’s ideas, saying: “In summer, there is no cold; people fail to notice this and use warmth, which leads to common errors.” If it is said that in summer one should take warming foods, then in winter one should take cooling foods. In that case, Mencius’s advice to drink soup in winter and water in summer would also be untrustworthy, wouldn&#39;t it? Alas! These words reflect a borrowing from a broader concept, and do not fundamentally engage in the analysis of yin and yang. Yet, Xu quotes them as evidence, without contemplating the texts and their meanings, perhaps contradicting themselves!</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;There is yin within yang, and yang within yin.&quot; It says: &quot;Extreme cold generates heat, and extreme heat generates cold.&quot; It declares: &quot;Heavy yin must produce yang, and heavy yang must produce yin.&quot; It says: &quot;Under the correspondence of fire, water vapor is sustained; under the sovereign fire, yin essence is sustained.&quot; These all express the interplay of yin and yang, the internal and external dynamics of complementing and opposing forces, thus responding to the heavenly yin and yang. Moreover, similarly in the &quot;I Ching,&quot; within the duality of yin and yang, there must be both; with dualities leading to four images, within yin and yang further lies the interplay of yin and yang.</p>
<p>In the context of the hexagram Tai, it speaks of inner yang and outer yin; the path of the noble person flourishes, while the path of the petty person declines. In the context of the hexagram Pi, it speaks of inner yin and outer yang; in this case, the path of the petty person flourishes, while the path of the noble person declines. From this perspective, the arguments of Danxi and the citations of Donggao are unconvincing to me, which is why I continue this discussion.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>On Xiangru Drink</strong></p>
<p>Xiangru drink is a herbal remedy commonly used in summer, often seen among wealthy families who prepare it abundantly, taken regularly by both young and old to prevent heat illness. However, few know who it truly benefits and who it does not. If misused, it certainly leads to illness. Why is this? Xiangru is aromatic and has a sinking, cold nature. Its aroma allows it to penetrate and reach both the upper and lower parts of the body, helping to dispel the damp heat of summer; its coldness enables it to quench thirst, alleviate restlessness, and clear the excessive fire evil. </p>
<p>However, it must be noted that it is suitable only for those with a strong yang organ, those who actually have fire evil, and those with robust spleen and stomach energy who tolerate excess warmth. Only they can withstand it, and they depend on its cooling effects, which are not without benefits. If taken by those whose energy is already deficient, it will likely deplete their energy further; if taken by those without real fire, it will undermine their yang. Generally, individuals who are naturally weak, aged, in poor health, or with inadequate diets are unaware of the risks and often misuse it. They typically exacerbate the hidden yin, weaken their stomach energy, and are susceptible to symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and severe cold conditions. Adding Huanglian further increases the coldness, while Houpo and Peiling, which break up qi, are not advisable. Users must be cautious!<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p>For poisoning from heatstroke: the lifesaving powder, use one liter of fresh sesame seeds, lightly roast until black, then cool and grind into powder. Take three qian mixed with fresh spring water, or form into pills the size of a marble, and swallow with water.</p>
<p>For sudden death from heatstroke: take a large spoonful of dough mixed with well water.</p>
<p>In hot months to relieve toxins: Gui Ling pills, made from cinnamon with the coarse skin removed, ground into fine powder mixed with Poria, formed into pills the size of longan with honey, to be dissolved in fresh spring water for consumption.</p>
<p>To quench thirst, make cinnamon water: in summer, drink this to relieve thirst and enhance energy while dispelling phlegm. Use two taels of cinnamon powder, one liter of white honey, mix with two dou of water, first boil down to one dou, then place in a new ceramic bottle, add the two ingredients, shake vigorously two or three hundred times. Seal with oiled paper in a double layer, removing one layer each day, and after seven days it will be fragrant and delicious, with an exceptional flavor that many people now prepare.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>Heat stroke without consciousness: One ounce of soap pod, burnt to retain its essence, one ounce of licorice, lightly roasted and powdered, mixed with warm water to administer one qian.</p>
<p>Heat stroke with fainting: In summer, if a person dies from heat while on the road, urgently move them to a shaded area, scoop hot soil from the path to cover their abdomen, let them urinate until warmth penetrates the abdomen, then administer remedies like earth paste or garlic water. Lin Yi says: This method comes from Zhang Zhongjing, its intention is exceptional, beyond the reach of ordinary circumstances, and is truly a great emergency technique. The abdomen is the root of life, and heat stroke damages qi, thus warming the abdomen is meant to reconnect it with original energy.</p>
<p>For heat stroke fatalities, one must not allow the person to cool down; if they cool down, they will die. Treatments include bending grass around the person’s abdomen, with two or three others urinating in it to warm them. Hot mud mixed with bent grass can also be used, or the bottom of a ceramic bowl pressed against the person, encouraging them to urinate, and ensuring the warmth flows away. This is called treatment when water is scarce and urgent; one must warm them with others urinating into it. If there is available water, it can be given, but mud and vehicle water should be avoided due to their coldness. Since heat strokes occur in summer, hot mud can be used, and warming vehicle water is also acceptable.</p>
<p>Heat exhaustion with lethargy: One cup of earth yellow juice should be taken.</p>
<p>For children suffering from heat stroke with vomiting, diarrhea, and thirst: Use valley essence grass, burnt to retain its essence, cover it with a container, cool it down and powder it; each time give half a qian mixed with cooled rice drink.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>In the heat of the sun, if one feels hot and has a headache, with a weak pulse, this is caused by the damage from cold water in the summer months, affecting the skin. Use two or seven pieces of melon seeds, one liter of water, boil to five cups, and take it all at once to induce vomiting. </p>
<p>For water leakage due to summer heat: use Bai Long Wan, 1 tael of fire-roasted talc, and 4 qian of sulfur, powdered together to form pills the size of a broad bean. Take with light ginger soup as needed, depending on size.</p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea in hot months: fry 2 taels of talc, 2.5 qian of patchouli, and 0.5 qian of cloves into a powder. Take 1-2 qian mixed with thin rice water.</p>
<p>For heatstroke leading to dizziness: drip fresh spring water into the nostrils and fan the person. In severe cases, administer potash water to revive them. Do not drink cold water, as it can be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: In the summer, maintain balance by exhaling to release heat and inhaling to harmonize the heart. Avoid eating foods that excite the heart and avoid foul air that affects the spirit. After midnight on the summer solstice, a yin energy arises from the earth. Do not eat cold foods in extreme heat, as they may provoke cold disorders. Also, avoid activities in the bedroom, as they can drain vital energy from the command point of life. In hot summer days, it is beneficial to nourish the heart to prevent autumn ailments. It is advisable to drink Liu Yi Deng Xin soup or cardamom and patchouli water, and avoid direct exposure to strong winds after heavy drinking. Being cautious in these matters will prevent illness.</p>
<p>In case of heatstroke, first drink hot tea or soup, keep the neck straight, roll the tongue against the upper palate, clench the hands into fists, and tighten the toes. This will naturally induce sweating and promote recovery.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Rites of Confucianism,&quot; there was a young man named Zheng, fifteen years old, who suffered from heatstroke while in the fields. He had a headache and was unable to rise from bed. A practitioner administered a remedy to dispel sweat, and also gave him a rice vinegar soup, but it did not relieve his condition. Later in the evening, he was given a large dose of a pill made from the three divine flowers, which led to his recovery.</p>
<p>Another case involved an elder named Zhang, aged seventy-one, who also suffered during the hot months while working in the fields due to hunger and heat exhaustion. He had no appetite, frequently vomited, and had a continuous flow of phlegm from his mouth, along with pain in his abdomen and sides. The physician initially prescribed several remedies including Pingwei Powder, Lizhong Pill, and Daogqi Pill, but they were ineffective. Acupuncture was also applied, with the diagnosis that his stomach was cold. The practitioner consulted with another healer, who indicated that phlegm was related to the stomach, which was too hot and did not absorb properly, resulting in a flow of phlegm. Given the patient’s advanced age, he dared not use strong remedies that could cause a surge. Instead, he used a chopstick to probe, which caused the elder to expel a liter of phlegm without the use of medicine. Afterwards, he administered Huanglian Qingxin Powder, Daoyin Pill, and Yulu Powder to adjust the balance, which improved his appetite. However, he still had constipation, so a decoction made from fresh ginger and jujube was prepared to aid his digestion. He ultimately recovered.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: There are individuals who suffer from headaches and fever, feel irritated and thirsty, and upon examining their pulse, it is large and weak. I prescribed Baihu Decoction for several doses, and they recovered. Zhongjing states: A weak pulse and fever indicate a condition caused by summer heat. He also mentions that the pulse may be slender, thin, and slow. Why is this? The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: Cold injures the body, while heat injures the qi. If the qi is harmed without affecting the body, the qi diminishes, leading to a weak pulse. What is referred to as slender, thin, and slow is all classified as a weak pulse. Zhongjing associates the slender pulse with yin, and Zhu Pang also states that a weak pulse arising from heatstroke indicates weakness.</p>
<p>In the year Gui Chou, my old friend Wang Yanlong served as a magistrate in Lingcang. In late summer, he fell ill with excessive sweating in the chest and neck, and cold limbs, speaking incoherently. The physicians were ignorant of the condition, and mixed various medicines over a period of ten days. Upon examining him, I found his pulse damp in the front and rapid in the back. I said: He should be treated for damp heat. This is due to having been affected by heat and then dampness; the combination of summer heat and dampness is termed damp heat. First, I administered Baihu Decoction with ginseng, followed by Baihu Decoction with Atractylodes, and gradually the headache receded, his feet became warm, sweating ceased, and he fully recovered in three days. This situation shows the danger of hidden evils when improperly using medicine, which leads to death.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>Outside the Baoping Gate, there was an inn run by someone with the surname Jiang, who was known for his singing and was loved by Sun. Suddenly, after a few days of not seeing him, Sun sent someone to inquire. Jiang responded: &quot;I&#39;ve been ill for a long time, and my life is about to end.&quot; </p>
<p>Sun examined him and found his body to be moist all over, his legs cold up to the knees, his abdomen distended, and he was unresponsive. His pulse was weak and rapid. When asked about the medicine he had been taking, Sun looked and found it was all medicine for yin diseases. Sun said, &quot;This is not due to a serious illness; rather, the medication has worsened your condition.&quot; </p>
<p>He then prescribed Wuling San and more than ten doses of Baihu Tang, and the illness slightly improved; after further treatment, he was completely healed. Once Jiang was well, he visited Sun to express his gratitude and asked, &quot;When I was severely ill, a single treatment restored me; I wish to know the method of your treatment.&quot; </p>
<p>Sun replied, &quot;Your illness resulted from heat injury. Initially, you experienced a slight yang collapse and a weak pulse. Other doctors regarded it as a yin disease and treated it with yin medicine, which resulted in your fainting. I used Wuling San, which greatly facilitated urination, thereby reducing your abdominal distension, and Baihu Tang cleared away the pathological heat, leading to your recovery. In general, when suffering from a yin disease, if the shins are cold, the arms will also be cold. Since your shins are cold but your arms are not, it indicates a slight yang collapse and upward rise, hence I discerned it was a case of yang collapse.&quot;<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>The &quot;Miraculous and Effective Remedies&quot; states: In the second year of Chongning, I was appointed to serve in the transport department and suffered from dysentery for two months during summer and autumn, going to the toilet thirty to forty times a day and night. However, there was more blood than pus, and famous doctors all declared it was dysentery. I heard that Li Zhonghe, a teaching assistant in Qingyang Town, was good at medicine, so I sent someone to summon him. When Zhonghe arrived and felt my pulse, he immediately said, &quot;This is not dysentery.&quot; I was initially very angry and pressed him further. Li replied, &quot;With more blood than pus, and scanty urination, it is indeed not dysentery.&quot; His words resonated with my condition, and I was already convinced. This was caused by a prior heat-stroke, transferring to the large intestine through the heart channel, thus transforming into blood and appearing like dysentery during bowel movements. The remedy is simply to allow the urine and stool to return to their respective organs. Crush coast grass into pieces the size of rice grains or grind it into fine powder. For the crushed pieces, take three qian each time with one cup of water, boil to seven-tenths concentration, and take warm; for the fine powder, take two qian each time, following the same method for boiling, and take one dose after meals and one before bed. Thus, I came to trust that there are such miraculous doctors in the world. A maid in my household had been suffering from chronic dysentery; after taking this remedy, she was healed, so I wrote down this account.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: Yan Xuan from Yaohai Mountain suffered from heat stroke, experiencing headaches, fever, shortness of breath with high spirits, extreme fatigue, and numbness in both hands. I believed that heat had damaged his vital energy, so I administered Ren Shen Yi Qi Decoction for immediate relief, and additionally used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, resulting in a complete recovery. </p>
<p>A man with inherently weak vital energy experienced dizziness, fatigue, and heat in his limbs. In midsummer, due to overwork and irregular eating, he developed numbness in both hands and overall fatigue. I believed that summer heat had harmed his vital energy, so I treated him with Ren Shen Yi Qi Decoction, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>A scholar experienced dry mouth and fever every spring and summer, and felt a headache after exertion. He took cool phlegm-reducing medicine, which caused him to purge and become restless; using a beverage of fragrant herb made his mind dull, and his pulse was large yet weak. This was due to the closing phase, where being not far from the curtains caused problems, a condition called &quot;summer retention.&quot; He used the Restore the Middle and Augment Qi Decoction, removing Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, and adding Wu Wei Zi, Mai Men Dong, and roasted ginger. After one dose, his pulse improved significantly; still, he used the previous medicine along with five grams of cinnamon, and upon taking it, he immediately felt restored. Then he used the Six Flavors Pill and was cured.</p>
<p>A man developed a fever in the height of summer, experiencing pain in his chest and back, and sweat was dripping from his body. He took medicines to induce sweating but became drowsy, spoke incoherently, and had loose stools with significant phlegm. He used the Ten Thoroughly Replenishing Decoction, and after one dose, his condition improved. He then took the Restore the Middle and Augment Qi Decoction with added roasted ginger, and after two doses, he was fully recovered.</p>
<p>According to Zhao&#39;s &quot;Medical Guide,&quot; a child suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, and exhibited agitation and spasms. Some believed it to be a shock or wind. I observed his dry mouth, fingers pointing at a teapot, and gurgling in his abdomen. I responded to all the doctors present, saying: &quot;This is easy to treat. Three herbs from the medicine basket are sufficient.&quot; I used five grams each of ginseng and Huang Lian, and three grams of licorice, decocted in water and taken cool; he swiftly fell into a peaceful sleep. Someone asked: &quot;Isn’t Huang Lian and licorice good for detoxification? Why add ginseng?&quot; I replied: &quot;If we do not use ginseng, this child would remain weak for several days. With ginseng, he shall be fine by the next day.&quot; Indeed, the next day, it turned out to be true.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　暍者中暑之称。《左传》荫暍人于樾下，其名久矣。后世以动而得之为中热，静而得之为中暑。然则道途中暍之人，可谓静而得之耶？动静二字，只可分外感内伤。动而得之，为外感天日之暑热；静而得之，因避天日之暑热而反受阴湿风露瓜果生冷所伤，则有之矣。时令小寒大寒，而人受之者为伤寒；时令小暑大暑，而人受之者即为伤暑。劳苦之人，凌寒触暑，故多病寒暑。安养之人，非有饮食房劳，为之招寒引暑，则寒暑无由入也。所以膏粱藜藿，东南西北，治不同也。　　体中多湿之人，最易中暑，两相感召故也。外暑蒸动内湿，二气交通，因而中暑。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>所以肥人湿多，夏月百计避暑，反为暑所中者，不能避身之湿，即不能避天之暑也。益元散驱湿从小便出，夏月服之解暑，有自来矣。然体盛湿多则宜之。清癯无湿之人，津液为时令所耗，当用生脉散充其津液。若用益元，妄利小水，竭其下泉，枯槁立至。况暑热蒸动之湿，即肥人多有内夹虚寒，因至霍乱吐泻，冷汗四逆，动关性命者，徒恃益元散解暑驱湿，反促其脏腑气绝者比比，可不辨而轻用之欤？不特此也，凡见汗多之体，即不可利其小便，盖胃中只此津液。夫既外泄，又复下行，所谓立匮之术也，仲景名曰无阳，其脉见短促结代，则去生远矣。　　中暑卒倒无知，名曰暑风。大率有虚实两途：实者，痰之实也。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>平素积痰，充满经络，一旦感召盛暑，痰阻其气，卒倒流涎，此湿暍合病之最剧者也。宜先吐其痰，后清其暑，犹易为也。虚者，阳之虚也。平素阳气衰微不振，阴寒久已用事，一旦感召盛暑，邪凑其虚，此湿暍病之得自虚寒者也。宜回阳药中兼清其暑，最难为也。丹溪谓：火令流金铄石，何阴冷之有？立言未免偏执，十中不无二三之误也。夫峨眉积雪，终古未消，岂以他山不然，遂谓夏月旷剎皆热火乎？人身之有积阴，乃至汤火不能温者，何以异此？《内经》谓：无者求之，虚者责之。可见不但有者实者之当求责矣。管见谓大黄龙丸，有中暍昏死灌之立苏者，非一征乎？间亦有中气者，为七情所伤，气厥无痰，宜用苏合香丸灌之。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>许学士云：此气暴厥逆而然，气复即已，虽不药亦愈，然苏后暑则宜清也。　　夏月人身之阳以汗而外泄，人身之阴以热而内耗，阴阳两俱不足。仲景于中暍病禁用汗下温针，汗则伤其阳，下则伤其阴，温针则引火热内攻，故禁之也。而其用药，但取甘寒，生津保肺，固阳益阴为治。此等关系最巨，今特挈出。《灵枢》有云：阴阳俱不足，补阳则阴竭，泻阴则阳亡。盖谓阳以阴为宅，补阳须不伤其阴；阴以阳为根，泻阴须不动其阳。夫既阴阳俱不足，则补泻不可轻言，才有补泻必造其偏，如重阴重阳之属，其初不过差之毫厘耳。所以过用甘温，恐犯补阳之戒；过用苦寒，恐犯泻阴之戒。但用一甘一寒，阴阳两无偏胜之药，清解暑热而平治之，所以为百代之宗也。　　夏月卒倒，不省人事，名曰暑风。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>乃心火暴甚，暑热乘之，令人噎闷，昏不知人。然亦有他脏素虚，暑得深中者，但不似心脏之笃耳。如入肝则眩运顽痹，入脾则昏睡不觉，入肺则喘满痿躄，入肾则消渴。虽当补益与清解兼行，然必审其属于何脏，用药乃得相当也。日中劳役而触冒其暑者，此宜清凉解其暑毒，如白虎汤、益元散、黄连香薷饮、三黄石膏汤之类，皆可取用也。　　深居广厦，袭风凉，餐生冷，遏抑其阳而病暑者，一切治暑清凉之方，即不得径情直施。如无汗仍须透表以宣其阳，如吐利急须和解以安其中，甚者少用温药以从治之。故冒暑之霍乱吐泻，以治暑为主；避暑之霍乱吐泻以和中温中为主，不可不辨也。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>　　元丰朝立和剂局，萃集医家经验之方，于中暑一门独详。以夏月暑证，五方历试，见闻广耳。其取用小半夏茯苓汤，不治其暑，颛治其湿；又以半夏、茯苓少加甘草，名消暑丸，见消暑在消其湿，名正言顺矣。其香薷饮，用香薷、扁豆、厚朴为主方，热盛则去扁豆加黄连为君，治其心火；湿盛则去黄连加茯苓、甘草，治其脾湿。其缩脾饮，则以脾为湿所浸淫而重滞，于扁豆、葛根、甘草中，佐以乌梅、砂仁、草果，以快脾而去脾所恶之湿；甚则用大顺散、来复丹，以治暑证之多泻利者，又即缩脾之意而推之也。其枇杷叶散，则以胃为湿所窃据而浊秽，故用香薷、枇杷叶、丁香、白茅香之辛香，以安胃而去胃所恶之臭；甚则用冷香饮子，以治暑证之多呕吐者，又即枇杷叶散而推之也。<a id="orig-60p" href="#trans-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>医者于热湿虚寒浅、深缓急间酌而用之，其利溥矣。而后来诸贤，以益虚继之。河间之桂苓甘露饮、五苓、三石，意在生津液以益胃之虚。子和之桂苓甘露散，用人参、葛根、甘草、藿香、木香，益虚之中，又兼去浊；或用十味香薷饮，于《局方》五味中增人参、黄芪、白朮、陈皮、木瓜，益虚以去湿热。乃至东垣之清暑益气汤、人参黄芪汤，又补中实卫以去其湿热，肥白内虚之人，勿论中暑与否，所宜频服者也。中暑必显躁烦热闷，东垣仿仲景竹叶石膏汤之制，方名清燥汤，仍以去湿为首务。夫燥与湿相反者也，而清燥亦务除湿，非东垣具过人之识不及此矣。<a id="orig-61p" href="#trans-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>又如益元散之去湿，而加辰砂则并去热；五苓散之去湿，而加人参则益虚，加辰砂减桂则去热；白虎汤加人参则益虚，加苍朮则胜湿；合之《局方》则大备矣，然尚有未备焉。昌观暑风一证，其卒倒类乎中风，而不可从风门索治。《百一选方》虽有大黄龙丸，初不为暑风立法。管见从而赞之曰：有中暍昏死，灌之立苏，则其方亦可得治暑风之一斑矣。倘或其人阴血素亏，暑毒深入血分，进以此丸，宁不立至危殆乎？《良方》复有地榆散，治中暑昏迷不省人事而欲死者，但用平常凉血之药，清解深入血分之暑风，良莫良于此矣。后有用之屡效，而美其名为泼火散者，知言哉！夫中天火运，流金烁石，而此能泼之，益见暑风为心火暴甚，煎熬阴血，舍清心凉血之外，无可扑灭矣。综群方而论列之，以其详，故益加详焉。<a id="orig-62p" href="#trans-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>　　　　　论金匮治暍用白虎加人参汤瓜蒂汤二方<br>　　《金匮》治暍病，止出二方：一者，白虎加人参汤，颛治其热。以夏月之热淫，必僭而犯上，伤其肺金，耗其津液，用之以救肺金存津液也。孙思邈之生脉散，李东垣之清暑益气汤，亦既祖之矣。一者，瓜蒂汤，颛治其湿。以夏月之湿淫，上甚为热，亦先伤其肺金，故外渍之水，得以聚于皮间。<a id="orig-63p" href="#trans-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>皮者肺之合也，用以(口畜)其胸中之水，或吐或泻而出，则肺气得以不壅，而皮间之水得以下趋也，何后人但宗仲景五苓散为例？如河间之通苓散，子和之桂苓甘露饮，非不得导湿消暑之意，求其引伸瓜蒂汤之制，以治上焦湿热而清夫肺金，则绝无一方矣。故特举二方，合论其义，见无形之热伤其肺金则用白虎加人参汤救之，有形之湿伤其肺金则用瓜蒂汤救之，各有所主也。二方《伤寒》痉湿暍篇中不载，《金匮》痉湿暍篇中复出之。金针暗度，宜识之矣。　　白虎加人参汤。本文云：太阳中热者，暍是也。其人汗出恶寒，身热而渴，白虎加人参汤主之。盖夏月汗出恶寒者，卫气虚也。身热而渴者，肺金受火克而燥渴也。《内经》曰：心移热于肺，传为膈消。消亦渴也。心火适王，肺金受制，证属太阳，然与冬月感寒之治不同，用此汤以救肺金，是为第一义矣。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>　　瓜蒂汤。本文云：太阳中暍，身热疼重而脉微弱，此以夏月伤冷水，水行皮中所致，一物瓜蒂汤主之。变散为汤，而去赤小豆、酸浆水，独用瓜蒂一味煎服，(口畜)去胸中之水，则皮中之水得以俱出也。(口畜)中有宣泄之义，汗如其故，不复水渍皮间矣。此即《内经》以水灌汗，乃至不复汗之证。仲景会其意，言中暍者，兼乎中湿，有所祖也。然水行皮中，何以脉见微弱耶？盖中暍脉本虚弱，而湿居皮肤，内合于肺，阻碍荣卫之运行，其脉更见微弱也。暍脉虚弱，按之无力；湿脉微弱，举之不利；湿与暍合之脉，则举按皆不利也。<a id="orig-65p" href="#trans-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>(口畜)去其水而荣卫通，肺气行，举指流利即湿去之征，按之有力即暍解之征。一物之微，其功效之神且捷者有如此矣。水行皮中，乃夏月偶伤之水，或过饮冷水，或以冷水灌汗，因致水渍皮中，遏郁其外出之阳，以故身热疼重，用瓜蒂一物驱逐其水，则阳气行而遏郁之病解矣。凡形寒饮冷则伤肺，乃积渐使然。此偶伤之水，不过伤肺所合之皮毛，故一(口畜)即通，并无借赤小豆、酸浆水之群力也。即是推之，久伤取冷，如风寒雨露，从天气而得之者，皆足遏郁其上焦之阳，又与地气之湿从足先受，宜利其小便者异治矣。可无辨欤！<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>　　　　　辨脉</p>

<p><strong>Theory of Vital Qi Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>Due to summer heat, sweating occurs; when one is agitated, there is panting and loud breathing, while in stillness, there is excessive talking. The body feels like burning charcoal, sweating profusely and dispersing. </p>
<p>*[Note: The yang evil of heaven harms the yang energy of the body, causing the qi to weaken and sweat to flow. If the pathogenic heat in the qi aspect is severe, it makes the person feel unsettled. The heart governs the pulse, thus the heart feels troubled. The lungs cover the heart, hence agitation leads to panting. If there is stillness without agitation, this pathogen remains in the qi aspect, harming the qi, and as the spirit is weakened, there is excessive talking. The yang evil of heaven harms the yang energy, and with the two yang aspects clashing, the body feels like burning charcoal. The yang heat pathogen resolves through the body&#39;s yin fluids, leading to sweating and dispersing.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the Lesser Yang, presiding over heaven, the fire energy descends, while the lung energy ascends. The Great Heat manifests, leading to coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion, oral ulcers, and fluctuations of heat and cold, with swelling. 【Note: In the records of Jin Ping, its organ is the lungs. The ascendance refers to the response to the descending heavenly energy, as one fears being overwhelmed by it. Coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion are all lung diseases. Oral ulcers, fluctuations of heat and cold, and swelling indicate heat conditions.】 </p>
<p>In the Lesser Yin, presiding over heaven, the hot energy descends, while the lung energy ascends. The white metal is utilized, vegetation becomes blighted, leading to wheezing, vomiting, and fluctuations of cold and heat, with sneezing, nasal congestion, and difficulty breathing. The Great Heat, when prevalent, can lead to ulcers and scorching, resembling molten metal and flowing stones. 【Note: The blight of vegetation, and the prevalence of Great Heat, is more intense than in spring and summer. The flow of molten metal and stones indicates excessive heat in autumn and winter.**</p>
<p><strong>The Great Treatise on the Correct Records of the Six Origins</strong></p>
<p>In the governance of the Lesser Yin presiding over heaven, the four energies interact, with the humid heat arriving, and heavy rain occurring frequently, alternating between cold and heat. The people suffer from symptoms of cold and heat, dryness in the throat, jaundice, nasal congestion, and excessive thirst. 【Note: In years of excessive conditions, relating to the four chief and guest energies, the humid earth is the master of the atmosphere. The mingling of humid and hot energies causes the arrival of humid heat and heavy rain, leading to alternating cold and heat. The people&#39;s symptoms of dry throats and jaundice are all due to the influence of humid heat.】 </p>
<p>In the realm of the Lesser Yang, it is the governor of the scorching heat and the place of heat accumulation, as well as the source of outflows. 【Note: The arrival of energies refers to the conditions of the four seasons influenced by the five movements and six energies, with the Lesser Yang governing the summer heat. The outflow refers to the energy emerging from within to the outside.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Importance of True Principles</strong></p>
<p>The victory of the lesser yin occurs when summer heat arrives, leading to symptoms such as nausea, irritability, abdominal fullness and pain, diarrhea, and a condition known as red dampness. 【Note: The arrival of summer heat coincides with the interaction of the lesser yang energy. Nausea indicates the upward rebellion of yin energy. Irritability reflects the symptoms of yin and yang coldness and heat. Abdominal fullness and diarrhea indicate the presence of cold yin below. The condition of red dampness suggests the excess fire of the heart descending.】<br>— <em>Lingshu Classic</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Seasonal Dew</strong></p>
<p>Human beings are affected by the four seasons and the eight winds, which is why there are cold and hot periods. In the cold, the skin tightens and the pores close; in the heat, the skin relaxes and the pores open. 【Note: The infiltration of pathogenic winds and evil qi into people is caused by the fluctuations of their vital energy, which allows for varying depths of invasion, not dependent solely on the opening and closing of cold and heat.】<br>— <em>Bian Que’s Difficult Classic</em></p>
<p><strong>Heat as a Cause of Heart Disease Related to Just and Disordered Conditions</strong></p>
<p>How can one recognize the injury caused by summer heat? The presence of foul odors indicates this. Why is that? The heart dominates odors; it manifests as burnt odors if excess heat accumulates within the heart, as fragrant odors when entering the spleen, as fetid smells when affecting the liver, as rotten smells when impacting the kidneys, and as fishy odors when it influences the lungs. Therefore, it is understood that heart disease can result from the damage caused by summer heat, characterized by aversion to foul smells, accompanied by a heated body, irritability, and pain in the heart, with an energetic pulse that is large and scattered. 【Note: The heart&#39;s dominion over odors indicates that the heart suffers from summer heat, hence the aversion to foul smells, a symptom that is reflected in the pulse diagnostics, all pertaining to the heart.】<br>The injury caused by summer heat relates to just and disordered conditions.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>There are three types of heatstroke.</strong></p>
<p>For heatstroke from excessive sun, the symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, thirst, and a heavy body. <strong>[Note: If there is sweating, chills, and fever without thirst, it indicates a wind attack. If there is sweating, chills, fever, and thirst, it indicates heatstroke, which is treated with Bai Hu decoction plus ginseng according to Jin Gui.]</strong> </p>
<p>For heatstroke due to excessive heat, the symptoms are fever and chills, with body heaviness and pain. The pulse is thin, wiry, and slow. If urination is light and sparse with the hair standing on end, and hands and feet are cold, slight exertion will raise body temperature, with a dry mouth and tongue. If sweating occurs, chills will worsen; if warming needles are applied, fever will increase; if purgatives are used excessively, it will lead to serious dysuria. <strong>[Note: There are conditions affecting the surface and the interior, and some that affect both. This indicates an illness affecting both. Fever, chills, heaviness, and pain signify a heatstroke affecting the surface. A thin, wiry pulse indicates vacuity due to heatstroke.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who have slight labor and feel heat are said to exert their yang and become thirsty. If the mouth is dry with the front teeth exposed, this indicates significant heat. If one seems to be gasping and cannot stop, it is due to the dryness of the front teeth. If sweating alleviates exterior evils, then the external yang qi is deficient, leading to severe aversion to cold. If warming needles are used to assist yang, then internal heat attacks, causing an increase in body temperature. If purging is done to eliminate internal heat, then there is internal deficiency and dryness in the bladder, resulting in severe dysuria. Xu said: This condition has no defined treatment; Dongyuan treats it with Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction, claiming it reveals the ancient secret.</p>
<p>Those with heat due to solar exposure experience heavy body pain with weak pulses; this results from cold water injuring them in summer, which causes fluid accumulation beneath the skin. The classic states: weak pulse and body heat arise from summer heat damage. Heat with weak pulses indicates thirst. Heavy body pain signifies water retention. In summer, exposure to high heat and water can lead to this condition. The &quot;Jinkui&quot; references a remedy involving the dried gourd stem powder or possibly the Wuling Powder.</p>

<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>When suffering from heat stroke, if the affliction is deep-rooted and does not heal, the person experiences incessant thirst. The remedy is to take wine-steamed Huanglian pills.</p>
<p><strong>Heat and Humidity Combined Illness Leading to Damp-Warmth</strong></p>
<p>If a person has previously suffered from dampness and then succumbs to heat stroke, the combination of damp and heat may manifest as damp-warmth, causing painful coldness in both legs, abdominal distension, excessive sweating from the chest, severe headaches, and delirium. The pulse will feel weak and moist on the Yang side, while the Yin side will be feeble and rapid. The treatment lies within the Taiyin; one must not induce sweating. If sweating occurs, the person will be unable to speak, may have hearing loss, and will no longer feel pain at the site of the affliction, with a bluish complexion. This condition is referred to as severe heat stroke, and if death occurs, it is due to the failure of the physician. The remedy is to use the White Tiger Soup with Cangzhu.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Season Adjustment Methods</strong></p>
<p>During the intense heat of summer, one must not wash the hands and face with cold water, as it harms the eyes significantly. The summer season is a time when people&#39;s spirits are easily drained; the heart is vigorous while the kidneys are weak. The kidneys transform into water, solidifying in autumn and becoming firm in winter. Therefore, one should be particularly careful with intimate activities and ensure the preservation of one&#39;s spirit.</p>
<p><strong>The Direct Guidelines of the Ren Zhai</strong> <strong>[Song Dynasty, Yang Dengfu]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heat Enters Through the Mouth and Nose</strong></p>
<p>The heart is interconnected with the stomach. If the stomach&#39;s energy is slightly deficient, or due to hunger one encounters heat, the heat toxins enter through the mouth and nose, condensing in the teeth and cheeks, reaching the heart like an echo. Therefore, if one encounters heat, it is advisable to rinse the mouth with water but not swallow it.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong> </p>
<p>Heat stroke occurs because the pulse is weak; it is because heat injures the vital energy without harming the physical body. Furthermore, &quot;heat&quot; corresponds to the heavens as heat, to the earth as fire, and to the human body as the heart. Thus, heat particularly injures the heart, causing symptoms such as body heat and headaches, resembling cold diseases, but with coldness in the back and dirt on the face, which distinguishes it. Symptoms include fainting, loss of consciousness, cold extremities, thirst, dry mouth, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and a feeling of fullness—all resulting from heat intake. </p>
<p>Generally, recovering from heat stroke requires avoiding cold water and lying on cold, damp ground, as exposure to cold can be fatal. Instead, one should maintain warmth, applying hot water compresses to the abdomen and the lower dantian, or using hot soil up to the navel, continuing to expel urine. Wait until the person gradually regains consciousness, then slowly administer rice soup and adjust treatment based on symptoms. </p>
<p>Recently, in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, there have been many incidents of heat stroke leading to convulsions, where the person is unresponsive; such cases are not documented in medical texts. Diagnosing the pulse as floating and weak indicates that floating relates to wind, and weak relates to heat—this is heat stroke compounded by wind, commonly known as &quot;heat wind.&quot; If one treats it as a shock or seizure, it often leads to no recovery. In urgent situations, it is advisable to dissolve Su He Xiang pills in warm water and administer them, awaiting slight recovery. Afterward, use a decoction of Huang Lian and Xiang Ru powder combined with Qiang Huo for treatment, and many have responded well to this method.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

Whether the symptoms are exterior or interior, Baihu Decoction is appropriate. If there is severe internal heat, fullness in the abdomen, and a sinking pulse that can be purged, Da Chengqi Decoction is recommended, or San Yi Chengqi Decoction is especially effective.</p>
<p>For those with heatstroke presenting with spontaneous sweating and a weak pulse, the heat injures qi, causing excessive sweating; hence, the pulse cannot be strong and instead becomes weak.</p>
<p>Symptoms of heatstroke include body heat, headache, chills in the back, sallow complexion, spontaneous sweating, irritability, extreme thirst, dry mouth, fatigue without body pain, sometimes with chills or fear of heat, a weak pulse, and regardless of exterior or interior symptoms, Baihu Decoction is suitable. In summer, catching a cold often leads to fever and thirst; thus, Wuling Powder, Guiling Ganlu Drink, Huanglian Xiangru Drink, or Shuangjie Powder can be used. If internal heat is severe, abdominal fullness, and a sunk pulse can be purged, Da Chengqi Decoction should be applied, or San Yi Chengqi Decoction is particularly good. For those in a half-exterior, half-interior condition, Xiao Chaihu Decoction, Liangge Powder, or Tianshui Powder can be used.</p>
<p>Movement and stillness are different.</p>
<p>In cases of movement leading to heat injury, the heart fire intensifies and lung qi is fully depleted, resulting in body heat and a bounding pulse. When movement produces excess fire, it injures qi. Baihu Decoction with ginseng is the main treatment. Those in hard labor often acquire this condition; it is essential to be aware of it.</p>
<p>In cases of stillness leading to heat injury, fire occupies the position of metal, lung qi moves to the exterior, resulting in chills and a rapid, deep pulse. When stillness results in excess dampness, the body feels heavy. Baihu Decoction with Atractylodes is the primary treatment. Those in a state of comfort frequently suffer from this; it is important to be aware.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinction between Heat Stroke and Excess Heat</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: Heat stroke is caused by remaining still, while excess heat is caused by movement. Heat stroke is a yin condition, and excess heat is a yang condition. If one avoids the heat in a deep hall or grand building and falls ill, it is called heat stroke. The symptoms will include headache, aversion to cold, a stiff body, joint pain, irritability, and extremely hot skin without sweat, due to being restrained by the yin cold of the room, preventing the body&#39;s yang energy from spreading out; Da Shun San is the remedy for this. However, if a traveler or farmer labors in the midday sun, it is called excess heat. The symptoms will include severe headache, agitation, feeling overheated, and extremely hot skin, with great thirst and copious sweating; one will lack the energy to move, which is an external injury to the lung energy from the intense heat, and the remedy is Cang Zhu Bai Hu Tang. </p>
<p>I propose that heat-related illnesses are a result of summer&#39;s decree; fire flows between heaven and earth, and people may labor or suffer from hunger, resulting in depleted vital energy that is insufficient to withstand the extreme decree of heaven, leading to injury and illness known as heat stroke or excess heat; in essence, they are the same. Why, then, distinguish them by movement and stillness? Indeed, heat stroke often occurs in laborers; the exertion makes them weak, and weakness allows pathogens to enter, causing illness. If one is not weak, then despite the extreme decree of heaven, there would be no way to harm them. Those who avoid the heat in deep halls and suffer from symptoms like headaches and aversion to cold are simply suffering from exposure to cold, and should not be labeled as experiencing heat stroke.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The distress caused by heat and the body feeling overly warm is not due to summer heat; rather, it is because the yang energy within the body is restrained by yin and cold. Since it is not summer heat, how can it be called heatstroke? If one wishes to treat it, then a gentle, warming formula can be used for dispersion. The Great Shun Powder is the main formula, with licorice as the most prominent ingredient, followed by dried ginger and almonds. Except for the cinnamon, the other three ingredients are all toasted, and this was originally intended to address the effects of overheating from excessive drinking, causing the spleen and stomach to be damp, leading to vomiting, where food and fluids become indistinct, and the organs are out of harmony. Thus, licorice and dried ginger are both roasted to ensure they are well-prepared. The use of cinnamon instead of cinnamon twig is meant to provide warming properties. The inclusion of almonds serves merely to help descend the qi. However, if this medicine is used to treat a static condition, I fear it cannot release the exterior and might actually increase internal distress. In today&#39;s society, many lack understanding and often assert that in the summer months, the internal yin energy is present, and the Great Shun Powder is a necessary medicine. Alas! Is this not a serious mistake? Yin energy is not cold energy; indeed, in summer, the yang energy disperses outward, while yin energy remains within. Is it appropriate to perceive yin energy as cold and use warming medicines against it? If yin were truly cold, why would water be consumed in summer? While the苍朮白虎汤 (Cang Zhu Bai Hu Decoction) is indeed suitable, should it be viewed as a universally applicable remedy? It must be combined with treatments for heat, using them according to the symptoms observed, for then it would be reasonable. As for what is called a diagnosis from a static condition, even during the summer months, if it is not a case of summer illness, it should be differentiated and not allow future generations to confuse the similar yet different signs.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Treatise on Stabbing Will&quot; states: Qi deficiency causes body heat, which results from summer heat injury. Heat damages Qi. The &quot;Treatise on Atrophy&quot; mentions: If one travels a great distance and becomes tired, encountering great heat and thirst, then thirst will deplete Yang Qi. If Yang Qi is depleted, heat will abandon the kidneys, which are the water organ. If water cannot overcome fire, bones will become dry and marrow will be deficient, leading to weakness in the legs and resulting in bone atrophy. Thus, the &quot;Lower Classics&quot; state: Bone atrophy arises from great heat. This form of damp-heat leads to atrophy, causing the bones to lack strength. Therefore, we treat atrophy primarily with Yangming.</p>
<p>During the long summer, damp-heat prevails and it is intensely oppressive. When people are affected by this, they often experience fatigue in their limbs, diminished spirit, reluctance to move, chest fullness, shortness of breath, heavy limbs and joints, or high fever with wheezing, a hot and irritable body, distension below the heart, yellow and scant urine, frequent and loose bowel movements, possibly with diarrhea resembling yellow liquid, or resembling thin rice soup.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If humidity collides, it must be treated with a gradual approach. Although the ailments may interchange and heal slowly, the cause is the same with heat and dampness in summer; therefore, it is advisable to treat it with drying and clearing agents. The Internal Classic states: &quot;Yang Qi protects the exterior and solidifies it; when it is insufficient, Qi leaks.&quot; Now, as summer pathogens disturb the protective layer, thus causing heat and sweating, the remedy is to use astragalus, ginseng, and licorice to tonify and enhance Qi. The peel of tangerine, and the body of angelica, sweet, spicy, and slightly warm, nourish the stomach Qi and harmonize the blood vessels, serving as assistants. Atractylodes, white atractylodes, and poria promote diuresis to eliminate dampness; caulis cum propriety and kudzu root, bitter, sweet, and neutral, effectively relieve muscle heat. </p>
<p>Additionally, when dampness prevails, digestion is affected, leading to bloating; thus, roasted malt, sweet and spicy, and the sweet warm flavor of green tangerine promote digestion and alleviate Qi stagnation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Managing Heat According to Seasonal Changes</strong></p>
<p>During the extremely hot months of summer, if one is harmed by cold and hard substances, warm medicines should be used. For instance, the herb Mu Xiang combined with Jian Wan will treat this condition. It is necessary to add a small amount of San Huang Wan, as it is said that the seasonal environment should not be violated; thus, cold medicines are added to align with the season. If harmed by heat, then only San Huang Wan should be used. What does this mean? San Huang Wan is a warm medicine.</p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach are weak, there will certainly be insufficient upward energy. When encountering the intense heat of summer, it can damage vital energy, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down. The limbs may become weak, and there is a lack of spirit, with the feet feeling limp. In the face of early morning or evening cold, after the sun is high and the Yang energy is strong, heat rises like fire, resulting in a lack of both Yin and Yang energy and blood. This might cause either heat syncope due to Yin deficiency or cold syncope due to Qi deficiency. Patients may struggle to taste food, feel a burning sensation in their eyes, see little clearly, experience frequent urination, and have difficult and constipated bowel movements. There may also be pain in the stomach and heart area, pain or cramping on both sides, a feeling of tightness around the navel, sharp pain akin to a knife when it becomes acute, a feeling of fullness in the abdomen, a sensation of blockage in the chest, occasional nausea, or phlegm cough; frothy white foam may form in the mouth, with a stiff tongue. Pain in the lower back and along the shoulder blades may occur, headaches may be episodic, appetite may diminish or a sense of fullness may arise immediately upon eating, showing no desire for food, along with particularly profuse sweating. </p>
<p>If Yin energy stands above the skin and hair, this is due to the heat of the weather exacerbating the original affliction, leading to the heat of the large intestine and lungs being affected. One must first help to boost the vital energy and address the insufficiency of the metal elements (geng and xin). The formula Huang Qi Ren Shen Decoction is advisable for this.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

To counteract heat that injures the original qi, ginseng, ophiopogon, and schisandra are used to nourish the pulse. The pulse represents the original qi. The sweetness of ginseng supplements the original qi and drains excessive heat. The bitter coldness of ophiopogon nourishes the source of water and clears dryness that affects the metal (lungs).

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Summer Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Summer is associated with yin deficiency and insufficient vital energy. At the beginning of summer and the end of spring, symptoms such as headaches, weak limbs, decreased appetite, and a feeling of heat in the body are noted. It is advisable to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Rx to tonify the middle and augment the qi) with the removal of Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, adding to it roasted Huang Bo and Bai Shao. For those with phlegm, add Nao Xing, Ban Xia, and Chen Pi for decoction. Alternatively, Sheng Mai Tang (Rx to generate the pulse) may be used. In cases of summer heat combined with phlegm and fire, emetic methods can be employed.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Lurking Yin in Summer Months</strong></p>
<p>Heaven and Earth operate through a singular vital essence, creating myriad things. The essence rooted in the internal is called &quot;shen ji&quot; (spiritual mechanism), while that rooted externally is referred to as &quot;qi&quot; and &quot;blood.&quot; All things share this singular essence. Humans are spiritually connected to these matters; in form, they partake in the cosmos, thus becoming a triad with Heaven and Earth, facilitated by their correct acquisition of qi. Therefore, when qi rises, people also rise, when qi floats, they also float; when qi descends, they descend, and when qi sinks, they also sink. Humanity shares this fundamental key with Heaven and Earth. </p>
<p>In the first month of the lunar calendar, yin is born, representing the initial movement of yang; in the third month, yang emerges from the earth, marking the ascent of qi. In the sixth month, when yang fully emerges from above, it signifies the floating of qi. The abdomen of a person is connected to the earth&#39;s qi, which at this time floats to the skin&#39;s surface, leading to a void in the abdomen. The classic text states: &quot;In summer, the meridians are full, the earth’s qi overflows, meridians receive blood, and the skin is filled.&quot; During the long summer, qi resides in the muscles, hence the surface is full, and when the surface is full, the interior must be deficient. It is said that in summer, lurking yin resides internally; this notion of yin implies deficiency. To interpret it as simply cold would be a significant misunderstanding.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

I replied: In spring and summer, we nurture yang; Wang Taibu said that we should eat cool foods in spring and cold foods in summer to nourish yang. This intention is evident. However, places with cool waters, large fans, and cold springs, as well as icy fruits and snow, harm us internally and externally. Without warmth, how can one find peace from illness? Upon careful examination, it is not meant for internal hidden cold. Moreover, ancient sages stated that rising and falling should be followed while cold and heat should be countered. If, in the summer when the fire element is strong, one blindly uses warmth, how can one avoid the real and illusory dangers? Someone else said: The month of Si is purely yang, which may make sense.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Key Points on Treatment for Heat Stroke</h3>
<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Heat stroke is characterized by a damp, waxy face and collapse, confusion, and unconsciousness. There is profuse cold sweating and slightly cold extremities. Symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, or difficulty breathing. Avoid using cold water or excessively cold substances. A herbal formula can be used to dispel heat, and water can be administered. Alternatively, powdered herbal remedy can be mixed with water, or powdered herbal remedy can be prepared and administered with water. Once the patient shows signs of recovery, give them a warm drink of agastache (香薷) without sediment, adding a small amount of musk for consumption. You may also insert garlic cloves in the nostrils or administer garlic water. The heat and toxins from the heat stroke injure both the exterior and interior. Many heat-relieving medicines contain warming ingredients, such as ginger and cinnamon in the Dashun San, cloves in the Loquat Leaf Powder, and agastache in the agastache drink. Agastache has a spicy and warming nature, as does garlic, which is also strongly pungent and can open all pathways. Generally, extremely pungent and fragrant substances can clear the pathways effectively.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

For a robust person, prepare a decoction with fragrant plantain and add one qian of huanglian; for a weak person, use a decoction of star anise and add one qian of fragrant plantain. If after treatment cold sweat continues, limbs remain cold, and there is much thirst and agitation, fragrant plantain decoction should be given. If doctors improperly administer cold remedies, it could lead to persistent vomiting and diarrhea, causing internal coldness and external heat, with increased agitation and thirst, resulting in a desire to be bare, resembling typhoid. In these cases, warming remedies should be used, combining fragrant plantain decoction with fuzi, prepared cold for consumption.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heatstroke</p>
<p>When the pulse is weak, the body is hot, and there is spontaneous sweating accompanied by a dislike of cold, this is known as heatstroke. The prescription is Baihu Decoction with Cinnamon. If one drinks cold beverages first and then suffers from heat, the prescription is Wuling Powder. This is certainly accompanied by a sensation of fullness below the heart. Ginger Decoction should be adjusted for consumption, which is favorable; or one can use the Four Gentleman Decoction for adjustment as well.

<p>Moreover, regarding the term &quot;Zei Xie&quot; (thieving evil), I said: &quot;The &#39;Nan Jing&#39; states that there are five evils: real evil, false evil, proper evil, subtle evil, and thieving evil. Those evils that come later are considered false evils; those that come first are considered real evils; those that come from something one cannot overcome are thieving evils; those that come from what one can overcome are subtle evils; and the illness from one&#39;s own constitution is the proper evil.&quot; Furthermore, for instance, in the case of heart disease, heatstroke is the proper evil, while dampness acquired from it is the thieving evil. Now, if the heart first suffers from heat and dampness overcomes it, water conquering fire is something one cannot withstand, hence it is called thieving evil, which among the five evils is the most contrary. The &#39;Nan Jing&#39; states that in damp-heat conditions, Yang is moist and weak, and Yin is small and rapid. The weakness appears in the Yang aspect while dampness interacts with heat. The rapid response appears in the Yin aspect while heat steams up the dampness. Therefore, it is stated that heat and dampness act upon each other, termed damp-heat, which is called thieving evil. </p>
<p>Not only this, I have a chronic issue with stagnant drinking; every time during the hot months, my feet sweat excessively and do not dry. Taking this medicine for two or three doses immediately cures it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Summer Heat Disease</strong></p>
<p>After the summer solstice, diseases caused by heat are termed &quot;summer heat.&quot; Summer heat is a manifestation of the rising fire. During the summer months, people are affected by it from the mouth, entering and damaging the heart&#39;s protective channels. The pulse may be weak, or either floating and large but scattered, or fine and thin but delayed. This is because the heat damages the qi, leading to its depletion and a weak pulse. Symptoms include sweating, irritability with shortness of breath, excessive talking when calm, body heat with agitation, chest pain, intense thirst, headache accompanied by sweating, fatigue with shortness of breath, or yellowish blood in the stool with rashes; in severe cases, the heat may disturb the heart and spirit, causing loss of consciousness. </p>
<p>To treat summer heat, it is best to clear the heart and promote urination. Since summer heat damages the qi, augmenting the true qi is crucial. There may also be aversion to cold or cold limbs, and in severe cases, confusion or delirium leading to cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, phlegm causing nausea, or abdominal pain with dysentery; these are not due to summer heat harming the body but rather arise from the body&#39;s reaction to summer heat. Because the disease results from summer heat, it is also referred to as summer disease, but the treatment methods differ.</p>
<p>If a traveler or farmer becomes ill from laboring in the midday sun, it is considered an external injury and a yang condition. Such patients are likely to suffer from severe headaches, agitation, heat intolerance, a hot skin sensation, extreme thirst, sweating with an inability to move, indicating that the hot weather has harmed their original qi. The treatment should focus on clearing summer heat and boosting qi, using herbs such as fragrant rush, coptis, hyacinth bean, ginseng, astragalus, five-flavored herb, anemarrhena, and gypsum.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In hot weather, if one experiences thirst and a weak pulse, it is advisable to use the Baihu Decoction with Ginseng. Use 1.5 qian of ginseng, 2 qian each of licorice and anemarrhena, and 5 qian of gypsum. The Zhuyeshigao Decoction is also effective. Use 1 liang of gypsum, 2.5 qian of pinellia, 2 qian each of licorice and ginseng, and 5 qian of ophiopogon, along with bamboo leaves, and boil in water to take.</p>
<p>If during the hot weather, healthy individuals seek relief from heat and cool themselves in deep halls and cool pavilions with large fans, they attain calmness and experience yin symptoms. This may lead to headaches, chills, stiffness in the body, pain in the limbs and joints, and a feeling of heat without sweating. This is caused by the restraint of yin cold, preventing the yang energy from spreading. It is recommended to use warm and pungent remedies to release the exterior and dispel the cold, using ingredients such as magnolia bark, perilla, dry kudzu, patchouli, notopterygium, and astragalus. If one has already been exposed to cold externally and has also consumed ice water or cold fruits, add dry ginger and cardamom to the previous prescription.

Moreover, the Kidney Water often relies on the Lung Metal for nurturing to compensate for its deficiencies. In ancient times, during the summer months, people would sleep alone and eat bland foods to nurture the organs of Metal and Water. The classics state: &quot;He who stores essence in winter does not suffer from warmth in spring.&quot; October corresponds to the Water of the Pig, and November corresponds to the Water of the Rat, when the Fire energy is stored; one must nurture the foundational truth to support the emergence of spring.

If fatigued severely, add four or five fen of cooked Fu Zi. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: According to previous discussions on revealing the ignorance of the secular world and alleviating endless sufferings. Internally using Fu Zi is especially suitable for those who are typically sensitive to cold food and drink. If someone generally likes cold food and drink, it is also acceptable to substitute with meat桂 (Rou Gui) or fried ginger. If the fatigue is caused by heat injuring energy, leading to tired limbs or numbness in hands and feet, one should first use Ren Shen Yi Qi Tang and then use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. </p>
<p>If a person has overworked their mind with worry, damaging their spirit, experiencing dizziness and blurred vision, with weak heart and shortness of breath, one should primarily tonify blood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> The previous diagnosis should use this formula and should not be taken in excess. Ingredients such as Ophiopogon (Mai Men Dong), Peony (Shao Yao), Gardenia (Shan Zhi), and Rehmannia (Sheng Di) are bitter and cold, which may further harm the spleen&#39;s qi. If the spleen and stomach are generally weak and hot and one suffers from the previous symptoms, it is enough to use the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; with Ophiopogon and Five-Flavored Herb. If due to hunger, thirst, or overexertion, leading to high qi and panting, a hot body and agitation, or spontaneous sweating, this indicates internal injury to the yang qi, and the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; should be used. If due to fluctuations in hunger and fullness or improper sweating, resulting in hot, dry muscles, intense thirst, red eyes, flushed face, a large pulse that feels vacuous upon pressing, this indicates blood loss and agitation, and the &quot;Danggui Buxue Decoction&quot; should be used. </p>
<p>Heat resulting from summer heat is due to fire evil harming the heart, consuming the original qi, and causing the evil heat to invade.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In summer, yang qi is predominant externally while yin qi is hidden internally. The principle should be to primarily tonify the yang qi while simultaneously alleviating heat, following the good method of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; of addressing time in accordance with indications. Therefore, in the previous case, one should investigate the cause and treat it accordingly; the indiscriminate use of herbs like Pogostemon (Xiangru) decoction should be avoided, as it can scatter the yang qi, damage the true yin, and worsen the condition.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In summer, people use mint to brew tea, not realizing that it disperses one&#39;s true vitality, similar to how prolonged use of Chuanxiong soup can lead to sudden death. </p>
<p>Summer ailments caused by heat, although categorized as external influences, are akin to internal injuries and are significantly different from those of cold damage. Cold harms the exterior and obstructs the surface, presenting signs of excess, thus requiring sweating. Heat injures the vital energy, dissipating it and showing signs of deficiency, hence it needs to be replenished. This is what Dongyuan referred to as &quot;clearing heat and benefiting energy.&quot;</p>
<p>There are also cases where excessive consumption of cold substances due to the heat might harm the internal organs, or overexposure to cold air might damage the exterior; these are not injuries from heat but rather sicknesses caused by oneself due to the heat, and should be treated with warming and dispersing herbs or warming herbs that regulate the interior, similar to treatments for cold damage.</p>
<p>During summer, the yang energy rises to the surface, while yin energy sinks within. Overexertion through diet or labor can internally harm the qi, or excessive labor in intense heat can harm the yang energy, leading to numerous ailments. The principle should be to primarily tonify the original qi, supplemented by treatments that dispel heat. If one suffers from heat stroke, it indicates a deficiency of yin-cold, and the principle should be to primarily tonify the yang energy, with a slight addition of heat-dispelling treatments. Therefore, many ancient sages often used ginger, cinnamon, and aconite; this follows the sound principle of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; of treating based on symptoms rather than time.</p>
<p>Today, when faced with heat symptoms resulting in blue or darkened extremities or body parts, this is often due to not understanding the cause or inadequately warming and tonifying the interior, instead relying on the indiscriminate use of fragrant herbs like Banlangen tea. Banlangen tea disperses yang energy and leads the true yin, and if one’s vital energy is already weak or if there has been excessive labor and they use it, it is rarely without danger.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Introduction to Medicine (Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</h3>
<h4>Distinguishing Between Deficiency and Excess, Yin and Yang</h4>
<p>For summer diseases, when the body is hot with spontaneous sweating, thirst, and a dirty face, other symptoms are secondary changes that may involve internal injury. One must first inquire if the person has a history of deficiency or a weak stomach, or if they suffered from a major illness or exhaustive effort that led to summer heat injury; in such cases, it is advisable to clear summer heat and bolster energy. </p>
<p>If the person is fundamentally strong, robust, and without any signs of deficiency or illness, it is advisable to dispel summer heat and harmonize the middle. </p>
<p>For those residing in high, spacious buildings, if they suffer from what appears to be a heat syndrome related to the heart and spleen meridians, it is termed heatstroke, a yin condition; while those engaged in outdoor activities, experiencing symptoms similar to a cold syndrome related to the bladder meridian, it is termed sunstroke, which is a yang condition; yet in essence, they are the same. </p>
<p>However, when discussing heat exposure, it is referred to as heatstroke, whereas when referring to being pressured by the sun, it is called sunstroke. At the onset of heat, it enters through the mouth, nose, teeth, and cheeks, reaching the palms, thereby producing heat from heat. Hence, ancient methods to dispel summer heat include using cool water for irrigation, though it should not be swallowed. When it enters the liver, it causes dizziness and stiffness; when it enters the spleen, it results in faintness and unawareness; when it enters the lungs, it leads to cough, wheezing, and debilitation; and when it enters the kidneys, it causes excessive thirst, not limited to affecting the heart but impacting multiple organs as well.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Heatstroke and Heat Invasion</strong></p>
<p>Heatstroke brings the heart to a lethargic state, leading to fainting. Heat injury affects the flesh, causing restlessness throughout the body, which may feel like being pricked by needles or experiencing redness and swelling. This occurs because the heat rises above the ground, causing the body&#39;s energy to also rise to the surface of the skin. </p>
<p>When heat invades the stomach and intestines, it results in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. &quot;Hidden heat&quot; refers to heat that has invaded for a long duration and becomes concealed within the three burners of the stomach and intestines, damaging the vital energy without harming the form. Over a period of weeks or months, it may lead to fluctuating cold and heat, resulting in symptoms such as cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, intermittent fevers, thirst, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. However, heat illness often does not involve body pain; if pain does occur, it is likely due to bathing, where moistness and heat conflict.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Wind from Syncope</strong></p>
<p>This refers to the occurrence of heat in the middle and the indication of wind by the twitching of hands and feet, while coldness in the extremities points to syncope. Syncope and the hot syncope from cold damage have similar meanings; one might use Huanglian Xiangru San. Summer wind arises from overexertion, stirring the fire within the five organs, which, when combined with external heat, causes the metal to weaken and wood to flourish, leading to the generation of wind. In this case, Xiangru San may be combined with Qianghuo, or Liuhe Decoction combined with Xiaofeng San. If there is already phlegm and fluids present, and summer heat causes agitation, the combination of Liuhe Decoction and Xingxiang San should be applied. </p>
<p>If a person suddenly collapses on the road and it is not convenient to administer medicine, fearing loss of energy may result in difficulty in treatment, one should urgently support them in a cool place, avoiding damp and cold ground. Heat from the road should be drawn away by placing warm earth on the navel and making openings, encouraging urination over it. Fresh ginger or garlic should be chewed and taken with hot soup or children&#39;s urine. Externally, apply a cloth dipped in hot soup to warm the Qi Hai point, encouraging recovery. </p>
<p>It is particularly important afterward not to drink cold water, but instead take large doses of restorative medicine. For confusion of mind, Wuling San may be used, boiled with lamb&#39;s heart and mixed with powdered cinnabar for oral intake. If sweating occurs, add Huangqi. If someone has been drinking alcohol and heat enters the stomach causing blood in the urine, remove the cinnamon and add Huanglian. If there is confusion, palpitations, and nonsensical speech, use Yiyuan San with an increased amount of cinnabar, mixed with freshly drawn water for dosage. This is essential medicine to lower stomach fire, treat agitation, resolve dampness, and quell thirst.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Toxin and Phlegm Fire</strong></p>
<p>Heat toxin and phlegm fire can obstruct the chest, requiring an assessment of the body&#39;s condition to expel it, signifying that pent-up fire can be released. If there is phlegm, wheezing, shortness of breath, and a feeling of fullness in the chest, and medicines cannot be ingested, urgently prepare Liuhe Decoction blended with two厘 of musk to take. </p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong><br>In summer, people often drink cold water and eat cold food, thus promoting dampness while also aiding in dispersal and transport. For those who sweat excessively, it is advisable to avoid diuretics. To dispel heat, the following are recommended: Xiangru San, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, Qingfei Shengmai San, and Baihu Decoction with ginseng and chuanxiong added. If there is irregular cold and heat, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction. For harmonizing, it is suitable to use Xiao and Da Jiaozhong Decoction, Ruzhu Ling Decoction, Pi Pa Ye San, Weiling Decoction, Gui Ling Ganlu Drink, and Liuhe Decoction. </p>
<p>When there is hidden dampness inside, avoiding heat and craving coolness, while also being assailed by cold air from outside can depress the body&#39;s yang energy; therefore, it is appropriate to resolve this with spicy and warm dispersing remedies like Xianghuo Decoction. If there is exterior cold already received, and internally cold injury occurs, add dried ginger, cardamom, and shenqu. Conversely, if one is exposed to heat from the outside while sustaining internal injuries from cold food, leading to exterior heat and internal cold, use Qing Shu Yiqi Decoction. If there is no external cold but merely internal injury from cold causes abdominal pain and diarrhea, utilize Lizhong Decoction with malt and cardamom; or Da Shun San, or Erqi Dan with cold water; all serve to treat this condition. Inducing heat injury from cold is different from warming and dispersing to treat summer heat. Mistaken consumption can cause jaundice, spotting, accumulation of blood, distress, and death.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those suffering internal injuries from labor, or who are inherently weak with deficient qi and blood, particularly in the heat of summer, the primary focus should be on nourishment, and one must be cautious with the use of extremely hot or cold remedies. For those heavily affected by the heat with dark urine, the &quot;Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction&quot; is recommended. For those with mild heat and fatigue, the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; or even pills may be used. During temporary heatstroke, add fragrant plants like &quot;Xiang Ru&quot; and &quot;Bian Dou&quot;. If there is yin deficiency, &quot;Zi Yin Jiang Huo Decoction&quot; or &quot;Shen Qi Pill&quot; should be administered.</p>
<p>Severe heat damages qi. Health practitioners state that indulging in drinking and lust during this season can lead to the internal decay of the kidneys, ultimately resulting in deterioration by autumn and, in severe cases, leading to death by water retention. Regular protection against heat is advised; for those with a strong constitution, &quot;Xiang Ru San&quot; or &quot;Yi Yuan San&quot; may be used, while those with deficiencies should avoid it. It is known that individuals with spleen deficiency need not be overly troubled by summer labor or exposure to cool conditions; they often find themselves with headaches, weakness in the legs, little appetite, and a warm body at the turn of spring to early summer, a condition termed summer illness. The &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; is suitable, omitting &quot;Sheng&quot; and &quot;Chai,&quot; as well as ingredients like &quot;Huang Bo,&quot; &quot;Shao Yao,&quot; &quot;Wu Wei,&quot; and &quot;Mai Dong.&quot; If there is phlegm, add &quot;Ban Xia&quot; and ginger juice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Heat is a manifestation of the upward movement of fire. In the summer months, when people are exposed to it, it enters through the mouth and teeth, damaging the heart meridians and collaterals. The pulse may be weak, or it can be floating and large, or stringy, thin, weak, and slow. When heat injures the Qi, the Qi diminishes, leading to a weak pulse. The external symptoms include headache, body heat, dry mouth, thirst, facial greasiness, spontaneous sweating, fatigue, shortness of breath, chills, and aversion to heat. In severe cases, there may be delirium, resulting in cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, phlegm, and inverted flow, alongside yellowing and spots on the skin, all indicative of this condition. In more severe cases, the excess fire overwhelms metal, failing to balance wood, leading to liver excess and convulsions, resulting in a loss of consciousness. The pulse is weak and floating; the floating represents wind and the weak represents summer heat, commonly referred to as summer wind. The recommended treatment is a formula of Huang Lian and Xiang Ru decoction with added Qiang Huo, or simply a Shuang Jie powder with added Xiang Ru.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, the method for treating summer heat should focus on clearing the heart and promoting urination. If there is excessive sweating, one should not promote urination but instead use Bai Hu Tang to clear the heat. Next, treat the exterior and interior accordingly. If it is an exterior condition with headache and aversion to cold, one should use formulas like Shuang Jie San, adding Xiang Ru, or the Ten Flavor Xiang Ru Drink. For a half-exterior, half-interior condition with diarrhea and thirst, along with water regurgitation, use Wu Ling San. If there is severe heat and thirst, use Yi Yuan San to clear it. If both the exterior and interior heat are severe, use Jiedu Tang and Shen Xiong Wan, or wine-steamed Huang Lian. For individuals who are typically weak, or elderly persons suffering from summer heat with weak pulse and diarrhea, and who crave warmth or exhibit syncope, use Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang with half a piece of Fu Zi taken cold. During summer, one must avoid all hot and drying agents. If misused, it can lead to symptoms of jaundice with small urine output, confusion, and possibly death.</p>
<p>When distinguishing between damage from summer heat and cold damage, both present with fever but should be clearly identified. Cold damages the body&#39;s form, while summer heat damages qi. Cold damage is characterized by aversion to cold with a floating and tense pulse, while summer heat exhibits aversion to heat with a weak and faint pulse—this is the difference. The classics state: a strong pulse with cold body indicates cold damage; a weak pulse with hot body indicates summer heat damage. The treatment should involve Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Shi Gao and Zhi Mu, or the use of Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang. In times of excessive rain and dampness coupled with cold, use Cang Zhu Bai Hu Tang. For those whose original qi is weak but suffering from severe damage, use Qing Shu Yi Qi Tang.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>It is noted that heat illnesses such as summer heatstroke, heat exhaustion, and heat sickness, though they have different names, are in fact the same condition. If one is harmed by cold in winter and later develops a heat illness in summer, this transforms due to a delayed response, indicating a disease that has moved from the inside to the surface of the body, which is commonly referred to as a late onset. This differs from the acute onset of new heatstroke. It is said that in cases of new heatstroke, the pulse is weak, whereas in cases of late-onset heat illness, the pulse is strong.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiating Between Heat Stroke and Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>Zhang said: &quot;The clear pathogens enter from above, while the turbid pathogens enter from below. Wind, cold, and dampness are all the energies of the earth and are associated with turbid pathogens, which is why they affect the channels of the lower body. Only summer heat is the energy of heaven, associated with clear pathogens, affecting the hand&#39;s lesser yin heart channel. The symptoms often resemble those of cold damage, but the pulse of heat stroke differs from that of cold damage. Although cold damage is characterized by aversion to cold and fever, in its early stages, it does not lead to thirst. In contrast, with heat stroke, thirst arises immediately upon onset, distinguishing it from cold damage. Furthermore, the pulse in cold damage is typically strong and floating, while in heat stroke, it is weak and may be wiry, thin, or slow. The classics state: &#39;A strong pulse with a cold body indicates cold damage; a weak pulse with a hot body indicates heat stroke.&#39; </p>
<p>For instance, if there is a condition resembling yang disease, with rigidity in the neck and back, sweating, and aversion to wind, during the hot summer days, would it not seem similar to heat stroke? However, the absence of thirst differentiates it, thus it is treated with Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang. Regardless of whether one resides in summer or autumn during hot weather, one should carefully follow the texts, for there is no worry of error. </p>
<p>In terms of symptoms, cold damage has aversion to cold, while heat damage has aversion to heat; in terms of pulse, cold damage presents with a strong pulse, while heat stroke shows a weak pulse. Additionally, the weak and thin pulse of heat stroke has some similarities with the pulse of damp constriction, but the symptoms differ. With heat, there is spontaneous sweating and thirst; with dampness, there is no thirst; and with constriction, there is body pain.**<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse is weak and the body is hot due to sunstroke.</p>
<p>Liu Chun stated: According to Scholar Xu, the pulse when harmed by heat is thin, fine, and weak—why is this? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: cold injures the form, while heat injures the qi. Thus, if the qi is harmed but not the form, the qi depletes and the pulse weakens. The terms thin, fine, and weak all refer to a deficient pulse. Zhongjing identified the thin pulse as indicating yin, and Zhu Gong also mentioned that a pulse weak and fine corresponds to sunstroke, confirming that it is indeed a deficient pulse. </p>
<p>Sunstroke resembles the manifestations of heat illness, but in heat illness the pulse is robust, whereas in sunstroke, the pulse is weak; this is the distinguishing factor.

<p><strong>Heat Stroke</strong></p>
<p>Heat stroke is the term used for those who suffer from heat illness. According to the &quot;Zuo Zhuan,&quot; it has long been known that people are shaded under trees to avoid heat. In later generations, those who become ill due to movement are said to have heat exhaustion, while those who suffer while at rest are considered to have heat stroke. Thus, can we say that those who suffer from heat while traveling are experiencing it at rest? The terms &quot;movement&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; can only distinguish between external influences and internal injuries. If one becomes ill due to movement, it is an external reaction to the heat of the sun; if one becomes ill due to resting, it is an injury from avoiding the sun’s heat only to suffer from dampness, wind, dew, and the consumption of cold fruits. During the seasons of minor and major cold, those who are affected suffer from cold illnesses; during the minor and major heat seasons, those who are affected suffer from heat illnesses. Laborious people, exposed to cold and heat, are thus more prone to cold and heat-related illnesses. Conversely, those who live in comfort and do not expose themselves to cold or heat through diet and activity invite no such ailments. Therefore, the treatment varies based on food and geography. Individuals with excessive internal dampness are most susceptible to heat stroke, as both external heat and internal dampness interact and cause it.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, those who are overweight and have excess moisture, during the summer months try many methods to avoid the heat, but if they cannot avoid the moisture in their bodies, they will not be able to escape the heat of the heavens either. The Yiyuan Powder drives out dampness through urination, and taking it in the summer alleviates heat, and this has been known for a long time. However, it is suitable for those whose bodies are full of dampness. For those with a lean and moist-free physique, their bodily fluids are consumed by seasonal changes, and they should use the Shengmai Powder to replenish their fluids. If they use Yiyuan recklessly to promote urination, they will deplete their lower sources, leading to dryness and deprivation. Moreover, the dampness induced by summer heat often coexists with underlying cold in overweight individuals, which can lead to severe symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, cold sweats, and life-threatening conditions. Relying solely on Yiyuan Powder to relieve heat and drive out dampness often exacerbates the situation, ultimately compromising organ function. Is it not crucial to discern its use with care? Furthermore, whenever there is excessive sweating, one should avoid promoting urination. This is vital, as the only bodily fluids in the stomach are this moisture. Once it leaks out and flows downward, it can be termed an approach that leads to depletion. Zhongjing referred to this condition as &quot;no yang,&quot; and if their pulse is short, rapid, and weak, that indicates a departure from vitality. Sudden heatstroke can lead to collapse and loss of consciousness, commonly referred to as &quot;heat wind.&quot; There are typically two pathways: one is the presence of phlegm.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ordinary times, phlegm accumulates, filling the meridians. Once subjected to intense heat, phlegm obstructs the qi, leading to sudden drooling; this is the most severe manifestation of humid heat disease. It is advisable to first induce vomiting to expel the phlegm, then clear the heat, which is relatively easier to manage. In cases of deficiency, it is a deficiency of yang. When the yang qi is weak and inert over time, while yin cold has long been in effect, upon suddenly encountering intense heat, the evil harmonizes with this deficiency, which is how humid heat disease arises from deficiency and cold. It is best to use warming medicines that also clear the heat, which is the most difficult to address. Danxi stated: &quot;Fire transforms gold into molten stone; what is there of cold?&quot; This assertion seems overly one-sided and cannot avoid mistakes in two or three out of ten cases. Just as the snow atop Mount Emei has never melted, how can it be said that all temples are hot in summer due to this misconception? In the human body, if there is accumulated yin to the extent that even boiling water cannot warm it, how is this different? The Inner Canon states: &quot;Seek what is lacking, and hold accountable what is deficient.&quot; This shows that we must not only seek and hold accountable for what is present and real. In my humble opinion, the Dahuang Long Wan can effectively revive those who have fainted due to heat stroke; isn’t that an example? There are also those with middle qi deficiency caused by emotional distress, where the qi is stagnant without phlegm; in such cases, Suhe Xiang Wan is advised for treatment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Scholar Xu said: This condition features a violent reversal of qi, yet it will quickly recover on its own. Even without medication, it can heal; however, afterward, it is advisable to clear away the summer heat. In summer, the yang of the human body leaks out through sweat, while the yin is consumed internally due to heat, resulting in a deficiency of both yin and yang. Zhongjing prohibited the use of sweating, purging, and warming needles in cases of draught illnesses because sweating harms the yang, purging injures the yin, and warming needles provoke internal heat, hence their ban. Instead, treatment focuses solely on using sweet and cold medicines that nourish fluids, protect the lungs, bolster the yang, and enrich the yin. The relationship between these factors is crucial, which is why I have highlighted this. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When both yin and yang are deficient, replenishing yang exhausts yin, while draining yin leads to the loss of yang. This means that yang relies on yin as its home, so when replenishing yang, one must not harm yin; conversely, yin depends on yang as its root, so draining yin must not disrupt yang. When both yin and yang are deficient, one must be cautious about supplementation and draining; any efforts risk leaning too much toward one side, like an excess of yin or yang, resulting only in minute discrepancies. Therefore, excessive use of sweet and warm substances risks transgressing the caution against replenishing yang, while excessive bitter and cold substances could violate the caution against draining yin. However, when using a combination of sweet and cold—medications that do not favor either yin or yang—one can effectively clear and resolve summer heat. Thus, this has been the foundation for generations. In summer, sudden collapse and loss of consciousness is termed a summer wind.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart&#39;s fire is exceedingly violent, and the heat of summer acts upon it, causing choking discomfort, obscuring one&#39;s awareness. However, there are other organs that may be weak and vulnerable, and when they are deeply affected by heat, they do not react as robustly as the heart. If the heat enters the liver, it causes dizziness and stubborn obstruction; if it enters the spleen, it leads to drowsiness and unawareness; if it enters the lungs, it results in panting and weakness; and if it enters the kidneys, it leads to excessive thirst. </p>
<p>Both supplementation and cooling must be administered, but one must first ascertain which organ is involved, so that the treatment can be properly aligned. Those who labor in the heat at midday and are affected by the summer heat should be treated to cool and eliminate the heat toxins using methods such as Bai Hu Decoction, Yi Yuan Powder, Huang Lian Xiang Ru Drink, and San Huang Shi Gao Decoction, all of which can be employed.</p>
<p>For those who reside in spacious buildings, are enveloped by cool breezes, eat raw and cold foods, and suppress their yang but fall ill from heat, all methods for treating summer heat and cooling should not be applied indiscriminately. If there is no sweating, one must still facilitate the surface to release the yang; if there are urgent symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, one must harmonize and relieve internally; in severe cases, it is advisable to use warm medicines sparingly for further treatment. Thus, in treating summer heat-induced disorders characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, the primary focus should be on treating the summer heat; for those avoiding the heat who experience similar symptoms, the main approach should be to harmonize and warm the interior, making it essential to differentiate between the two.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

In the summer months, due to heat-related conditions, extensive trials and observations were conducted. They employed a modified Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction, which did not directly treat the heat but rather addressed the dampness; additionally, a formulation of Banxia and Fuling with a little licorice was created, named Xiaoshuwan, indicating that cooling down the symptoms was indeed about dispelling dampness, making this reasoning sound.</p>
<p>Their Xiangru Drink primarily consisted of Xiangru, Cowpea, and Houpu; if heat was excessive, Cowpea was removed and Huanglian was added as the chief herb to treat heart fire; if dampness was excessive, Huanglian was removed and Fuling and licorice were added to combat spleen dampness. For the Squeeze Spleen Drink, since the spleen is affected by excessive dampness becoming congested, it was supplemented with Cowpea, Kudzu root, and licorice, along with Wumei, Sharen, and Caoguo to invigorate the spleen and eliminate its unwanted dampness; in severe cases, Dazun Powder and Laifu Dan were used to treat cases of heat stroke characterized by excessive diarrhea, aligning with the intent of squeezing the spleen.</p>
<p>As for the Loquat Leaf Powder, it was used to address the stomach being overtaken by dampness, leading to turbidity. Hence, they included Xiangru, Loquat leaves, Clove, and Baimaoxiang for their aromatic qualities to soothe the stomach and eliminate any foul odor; in severe cases, they employed Cold Fragrance Drink to treat instances of heat stroke characterized by excessive vomiting, which also aligned with the principles of Loquat Leaf Powder.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

Zi He’s &quot;Gui Ling Gan Lu Powder&quot; contains ginseng, kudzu root, licorice, patchouli, and amomum, which not only strengthens deficiencies but also eliminates turbidity; some use the &quot;Shi Wei Xiang Rou Drink&quot;, enhancing the five flavors in the &quot;Jufang&quot; with added ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and papaya, to strengthen deficiencies and eliminate damp heat.

The observation of heatstroke resembles a stroke, and one cannot treat it through the channels of the wind. Although the &quot;Baiyi Xuanfang&quot; has the Dahuang Long Wan, it was not initially intended for heatstroke. I tentatively commend it, saying: for those who faint due to heat, administering it will provide relief, thus it can be used to address heatstroke to some extent. If a person has already depleted Yin and blood, and the heat poison penetrates deeply into the blood, advancing with this pill could certainly lead to peril. The &quot;Liangfang&quot; also has the Diyi powder to treat those who are in a stupor from heatstroke and are on the brink of death, but it employs common cooling blood medications to clear the heat-affected blood. There is nothing better than this. Later, having used it effectively multiple times, it was praised with the name &quot;Pohuo powder.&quot; How insightful! For the celestial fire in the center of heaven flows like molten gold and shines like stone; this can extinguish it, further illustrating that the heatstroke is caused by excessive heart fire, boiling and depleting Yin blood.

The excessive heat can disturb and injure the lung&#39;s metal element, depleting its fluids, and this formula is used to preserve the lung&#39;s metal element and its fluids. The Shengmai Powder by Sun Simiao and the Qingshu Yiqi Decoction by Li Dongyuan also have their roots in this. The other formula is Guati Decoction, which mainly treats dampness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The skin is the counterpart of the lungs, used to contain the moisture within the chest. When it is expelled or released, the lung qi is unblocked, and the moisture between the skin can descend. Why do later scholars only focus on Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Wuling Powder? Take for example Hejian&#39;s Tongling Powder and Zihe&#39;s Guiling Ganlu Drink; they are clearly intended to guide dampness and alleviate summer heat. Whether extending the principles of the Guiti Decoction for treating upper burner damp-heat and clearing lung metal, there are indeed no other formulas. Thus, I specifically mention two formulas and discuss their meanings: when unseen heat injures lung metal, White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng is used to rescue it; when tangible dampness injures lung metal, Guiti Decoction is used to rescue it. Each has its own focus. These two formulas are not recorded in the chapter on cold-induced spasm due to damp heat in &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot; but appear again in the chapter on spasm due to damp heat in &quot;Jinkui Yao Lue.&quot; Recognizing the subtle yet critical distinctions is essential.</p>
<p>Regarding White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng, the text states: when there is internal heat in the Taiyang stage, this is termed &quot;heat stroke.&quot; The person sweats and feels cold, has a fever and thirst; White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng is indicated. Indeed, those who sweat and feel cold in summer have a deficiency of the defensive qi. Fever and thirst indicate that lung metal has been dried out by the fire&#39;s control. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; says: when the heart transfers heat to the lungs, it causes dryness in the diaphragm. This state also leads to thirst. The heart fire affecting the lung metal is associated with the Taiyang pattern but differs from treating cold exposure in winter. Using this decoction to rescue lung metal is the fundamental principle.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

This text states: In the case of a hot sensation in the middle (of the body), accompanied by bodily heat and heavy pain, along with a weak pulse, this results from summer&#39;s cold water damaging, causing water to flow within the skin. Gua Ti Decoction is indicated for this condition. Transform the powder into a decoction, removing red adzuki beans and sour jiaogulan, and solely using Gua Ti to prepare and take as a decoction. This will expel the water from the chest, and thus the water within the skin can also be eliminated. There is the meaning of discharge in &quot;expel,&quot; leading to sweat as a result, and no longer will water seep between the skin. This corresponds to the &quot;Neijing,&quot; where water fills sweat, leading to a lack of sweating. Zhang Zhongjing understood this concept, stating that middle heat also involves middle dampness, which has a relation. However, if water moves in the skin, why is the pulse seen as weak? It is because the middle heat pulse is originally weak, and dampness resides in the skin, internally connecting with the lungs, obstructing the flow of nutrients and defenses, causing the pulse to appear even weaker. The heat pulse is weak, pressing down reveals no strength; the damp pulse is weak, raising it is unbeneficial; thus, the pulse resulting from the combination of dampness and heat is also unbeneficial in both raising and pressing.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

<p>Moisture travels within the skin; during summer, it may come from excess cold water intake or from dousing with cold water after sweating, leading to moisture accumulation in the skin, obstructing outward flow of yang energy.

<p>In general, consuming cold drinks injures the lungs, and the damage accumulates over time.

The pulse flowing through the skin as water is said to be weak and shows the pulse retained by water and dampness, with yang qi not flowing. Generally, it is referred to as &quot;weak.&quot; In detail, it is described as thin, wiry, slow, and weak.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating heat stroke, if one does not distinguish between external causes and internal injuries, and only follows established formulas without considering activity and rest, the physician is at fault. In cases of cold disorders combined with heat, mistakenly using Yang Dan decoction leads to syncope. In cases of heat stroke with cold, mistakenly using Xiangru decoction results in throat obstruction. The later sages, by adding ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and papaya to Xiangru decoction to address internal injuries, indeed had good insights. However, those who do not differentiate between symptoms cause errors; can we stop here? </p>
<p>In treating heat stroke, failing to address the dampness is a physician&#39;s error. Heat steams the dampness, leading to heat stroke; without dampness, it is merely dry heat, not heat stroke. Thus, overweight individuals with excess dampness frequently suffer from heat stroke, while thin individuals with excess fiery conditions frequently suffer from heat illnesses.</p>
<p>When treating heat stroke, if the patient does not sweat, one must prioritize inducing sweating. If one only clears the interior without addressing the exterior, it is a physician&#39;s fault. Heat stroke should always result in profuse sweating; if there is no sweat, it is either due to water and dampness holding the person back or wind and cold obstructing. In such cases, one should first disperse the exterior pathogens, then induce sweating before clearing the interior.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Verification</strong></p>
<p>Heat illness originates from the heat of summer. However, there are those who suffer from heat stroke and those who become ill due to heat, resulting in different kinds of illnesses, all ultimately due to heat. Therefore, there are two kinds of illnesses: yin heat and yang heat, which must be treated differently, much like ice and fire. Those who seek to eliminate heat may inadvertently suffer from cold. </p>
<p>If people fear heat and crave coolness without avoiding cold drafts, they may find themselves in deep halls or under shady trees, or during times when it’s both hot and cold, not being careful with their clothing. This can lead to cold pathogens invading the surface of the body, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, chills without sweating, stiff body, and aching limbs. This condition, caused by cold exposure in summer, is labeled as yin heat, corresponding to wind-cold disease. The main treatment should focus on warming and dispersing, using methods for treating wind-cold.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases of negligence concerning diet, overindulging in raw and cold foods, leading to chills that harm the organs, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. This is also due to heat leading to cold, but with cold pathogens present internally; therefore, treatment should primarily focus on warming the center, which also belongs to yin heat. </p>
<p>Yang heat, on the other hand, refers to illnesses caused by excessive heat exposure.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of Zhongjing, it is referred to as &quot;zhong re&quot; (middle heat). Generally, during the peak of summer&#39;s intense heat, whether on long journeys or in the fields, when one does not shy away from labor, the excessive heat can injure the yin, leading to symptoms such as headache, irritability, high fever, intense thirst, profuse sweating, floating pulse, and possibly breathlessness or an inability to move. This is named &quot;yang shu&quot; (yang heat) because the heat occurs in the summer months. The treatment should focus on discerning the vacuity or solidity of the qi, and the mildness or severity of the fire, either supplementing or clearing to stabilize the qi. This is very different from the treatment of &quot;yin shu&quot; (yin heat). If one only considers the concept of heat and neglects to differentiate between exterior and interior, and does not understand yin and yang, it will lead to serious mistakes.</p>
<p>Yin heat symptoms may occur either superficially or internally, mostly found in wealthy and comfortable individuals. This often arises from indulging in emotions without restraint, making them susceptible to wind and cold. Yang heat symptoms mostly afflict those engaged in hard labor, resulting from direct exposure to summer heat, often beyond their capacity to endure. However, the heat of summer can be avoided, and those who are cautious tend to evade it, leading to fewer cases. In contrast, cold can invade without notice, and since many are unaware, they may easily fall victim to it. Therefore, among those who suffer from summer heat, cases of yang heat are rare, while yin heat constitutes eight or nine out of ten.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nowadays, when people treat heatstroke, they merely observe symptoms like fever and headaches, and they must conclude that it is heatstroke, using only cooling methods, which shows a great lack of understanding. </p>
<p>The illness caused by cold, although it originates from the same cold pathogen, is named differently. Similarly, although &quot;heat injury&quot; stems from the same heat pathogen, the diseases differ. The names for cold injuries differ: in winter’s cold, it is called true cold injury; in the warmth of spring, it is called warm disease; and in summer’s heat, it is termed heat disease. Warm disease and heat disease are simply different names for cold injury. The classic texts state: &quot;In winter, one is injured by cold; in spring, one will surely fall ill with warmth.&quot; It is also said: &quot;Any illness caused by cold that turns into warmth, if it occurs before the summer solstice, is warm disease; if after, it is heat disease.&quot; This is the distinction made.</p>
<p>Heat injury also has differences: if one is impacted by heat and subsequently feels cold, that cold injures the body, thus it is cold injury. If one is affected by heat and then suffers from heat, that heat injures the qi, thus it is heat injury. This refers to injuries from within or affects from without, but there are simply different types of heat disease. The texts state: &quot;If the qi is strong but the body is cold, it arises from cold injury; if the qi is weak but the body is hot, it arises from heat injury.&quot; This is the explanation.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the body&#39;s qi is abundant but the body is cold, it means the body is afflicted by cold pathogens while the qi remains intact; hence it is called &quot;cold injury.&quot; When the qi is weak but the body is hot, it indicates overheating that injures the qi; thus it is termed &quot;heat injury.&quot; Many people do not understand this point and mistakenly believe that cold injury must always involve a cold body, which is logically inconsistent and greatly misinterprets the texts.</p>
<p>In the summer months when the heat is intense, one must ensure that the body has a slight sweat, as this is the most appropriate way to nourish the body during this season. If one insists on being completely dry without sweating, it tends to result in an excess of yin over yang, leading to various illnesses. Observing the classics, it is stated: &quot;Heat should be accompanied by sweating; do not suppress it.&quot; This indicates that sweating during heat should not be hindered. It is also stated: &quot;If sweating does not occur during summer heat, it will lead to autumn&#39;s wind and fever.&quot; This highlights that a lack of sweating during summer heat can be a disease. Thus, the appropriateness of sweating in the summer can be understood.</p>
<p>There are eight signs of heatstroke: weak pulse, spontaneous sweating, body heat, coldness in the back, facial dirtiness, restlessness and thirst, slightly cold hands and feet, and a feeling of heaviness in the body. In treating these conditions, it is crucial to prioritize the regulation of the original qi, followed by clearing and benefiting.</p>
<p>In cases of heatstroke resulting in death, one should not allow exposure to cold; doing so can be fatal. It is preferable to use warm substances to protect the abdomen and treat the condition slowly.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the hot months, if one is externally affected by wind and cold, it can lead to the suppression of Yang Qi by Yin evil, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff and painful limbs, lack of sweating, aversion to cold, and a tense pulse.

<p>If the cold evil has not yet resolved on the surface, with the six pulses feeling weak and tight, a cold back, aversion to cold, or symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea without internal heat, this indicates that true Yin is concealed within, and the evil is not easily resolved.

<p>Severe heat can harm a person, deriving from heat symptoms; however, within Yang, there are also Yin and Yang, which must be distinguished. Generally, those suffering from summer heat tend to have a deficiency of Qi, as fire can undermine metal, and heat damages Qi. It is essential to clear heat and to replenish deficiency. For those who are predominantly Yang within Yang, they should also be treated with clearing methods. Symptoms like body heat, headache, irritability, intense thirst, profuse sweating, and a rapid, slippery pulse, accompanied by a preference for cold water, dry stools, and painful, red urine, all indicate Yang symptoms. If the Qi is not significantly deficient but there are just fiery symptoms, one should consider White Tiger Decoction or Yiyuan Powder. If the heat is very intense, Jade Spring Powder would be even better. If sweating occurs with a weak pulse, thirst is present, and there is fire with scant Qi, White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng or Zhang Jing&#39;s Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction, or drinks like those in &quot;Xuanning&quot; with cinnamon, Poria, and sweet dew should be considered. If dizziness and shortness of breath occur, though thirst is present and fire isn’t too severe, Sheng Mai Powder should be used. The methods mentioned above for treating Yang within Yang are all from ancient wisdom. However, if there is intense heat and thirst, yet a weak and powerless pulse, or if pressing down produces no response, along with a feeling of weakness and rapid breathing, this indicates a deficiency of Spleen and Stomach Qi and insufficient original Yang. This is a false fire condition; mistakenly using White Tiger or similar formulas could lead to a critical situation.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of heatstroke, people usually recognize it as a manifestation of Yang, but they fail to understand that there is Yin within Yang.

In the summer months, if one is overly fatigued during intense heat and suffers from heatstroke, their fatigue has already harmed the spleen, and the heat further damages the energy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Hidden Yin in Summer Months</strong></p>
<p>The hidden Yin during the summer months is a principle of the natural ebb and flow of Yin and Yang in the world. However, Danxi has specifically addressed this issue yet has interpreted it contrary to its true meaning, leading people to doubt its essence. What does he mean? He discusses that humans share a connection with Heaven and Earth. In the first month (Zi), Yang is born, and it begins to move; in the third month (Yin), three Yangs are born, and Yang first emerges from the ground. This represents the rising energy. In the sixth month (Si), six Yangs are born, and Yang fully emerges above, signifying the floating energy. The human abdomen corresponds to the Earth&#39;s energy and at this time, it floats at the surface of the skin, dispersing into the dermis, rendering the abdomen empty.</p>
<p>People say that the hidden Yin is within during the summer months, and this notion of Yin implies emptiness. If one interprets it merely as coldness, it leads to significant misunderstandings. Moreover, during this period, Yang is abundant above ground, burning and scorching, flowing like molten gold and dazzling like stone; how can there be anything cold or Yin? If one carelessly introduces warmth during the summer, can they avoid the troubles of an imbalance between reality and illusion? Danxi&#39;s mention of emptiness is indeed correct. However, treating coldness as a misconception while also prohibiting warmth in summer is something I cannot accept.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can this be understood? The way of heaven and earth relies on yin and yang. The transformations of yin and yang are based on growth and decline. Thus, when one comes, another departs; when one rises, another falls, and the mechanisms of creation are mutually concealed for utility. The classics say: Yin governs cold, and yang governs heat. It also states: Qi that is abundant is hot, while qi that is deficient is cold. This is the fundamental nature of yin and yang. Now, since it is said that in summer the yang floats outside, then the yin must be hidden within. When yin is strong, yang is weak; how can it not be cold? When yang floats outside, qi is deficient inside; how can it not be cold? This is a principle that is inherently unchanging. However, what is even more evident can be seen in the water of wells and springs: during the harsh cold of three winters, the well water is warm; during the scorching heat of midsummer, the spring water is cold. Is this not a clear example of external cold and internal heat, or external heat and internal cold? This holds true year after year and represents the constant seasons of qi. Beyond the primary qi, there are also foreign qi, with heaven set in five phases and earth equipped with six, where cold and warmth alternate and qi changes correspondingly.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as the record of the cold and clear during the伏明 period has been frequently noted; the record of wind and cold during the卑监 period has also risen; the record of the sun&#39;s energy in conjunction with the control of yin and its transformation during the坚成 period; and the record of cold influencing the transformation of things during the流衍 period, when heaven and earth become solemn and still; the sun governs heaven, and cold air descends, bringing forth cold and clear times; the moon governs heaven, hiding the yin within the earth, leading to great cold, etc. This means that regardless of winter or summer, there exist unseasonal energies that provoke ailments among the people. Moreover, should we claim that due to the fire of summer months, there is no cold, and thus prohibit the use of warmth? The principle of伏阴 (hidden yin) essentially refers to the interplay of yin and yang in relation to cold and heat; if one were to merely treat the word &quot;cold&quot; as void, then in summer, hidden yin would imply many void syndromes, while in winter, with hidden yang, there would be none remaining—could it be so? Further, if in summer, warmth should be prohibited, then in winter, cold should equally be banned—this is simply self-evident. </p>
<p>Now, observing the ailments across the four seasons, it is clear that in midsummer there are often many cases of vomiting and diarrhea, while in the depths of winter, rashes and sores are particularly evident. Such conditions—are they not due to an excess of internal heat in winter and an abundance of middle cold in summer? In summary, in summer there are heat syndromes and also cold syndromes; in winter there are excess syndromes and also void syndromes. Although treatment should vary based on the season and symptoms, it is critical to adapt according to the illnesses encountered. However, the principle of伏阴 in summer truly reflects the synchrony of heaven and humanity, being the original mechanism of disease that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we consider the arguments of Danxi, they contradict the principles of reasoning; what relevance do they have to practice? Even without these arguments, what harm is there? Recently, I saw Xu Donggao also discussing Danxi’s ideas, saying: “In summer, there is no cold; people fail to notice this and use warmth, which leads to common errors.” If it is said that in summer one should take warming foods, then in winter one should take cooling foods. In that case, Mencius’s advice to drink soup in winter and water in summer would also be untrustworthy, wouldn&#39;t it? Alas! These words reflect a borrowing from a broader concept, and do not fundamentally engage in the analysis of yin and yang. Yet, Xu quotes them as evidence, without contemplating the texts and their meanings, perhaps contradicting themselves!</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;There is yin within yang, and yang within yin.&quot; It says: &quot;Extreme cold generates heat, and extreme heat generates cold.&quot; It declares: &quot;Heavy yin must produce yang, and heavy yang must produce yin.&quot; It says: &quot;Under the correspondence of fire, water vapor is sustained; under the sovereign fire, yin essence is sustained.&quot; These all express the interplay of yin and yang, the internal and external dynamics of complementing and opposing forces, thus responding to the heavenly yin and yang. Moreover, similarly in the &quot;I Ching,&quot; within the duality of yin and yang, there must be both; with dualities leading to four images, within yin and yang further lies the interplay of yin and yang.</p>
<p>In the context of the hexagram Tai, it speaks of inner yang and outer yin; the path of the noble person flourishes, while the path of the petty person declines. In the context of the hexagram Pi, it speaks of inner yin and outer yang; in this case, the path of the petty person flourishes, while the path of the noble person declines. From this perspective, the arguments of Danxi and the citations of Donggao are unconvincing to me, which is why I continue this discussion.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Xiangru Drink</strong></p>
<p>Xiangru drink is a herbal remedy commonly used in summer, often seen among wealthy families who prepare it abundantly, taken regularly by both young and old to prevent heat illness. However, few know who it truly benefits and who it does not. If misused, it certainly leads to illness. Why is this? Xiangru is aromatic and has a sinking, cold nature. Its aroma allows it to penetrate and reach both the upper and lower parts of the body, helping to dispel the damp heat of summer; its coldness enables it to quench thirst, alleviate restlessness, and clear the excessive fire evil. </p>
<p>However, it must be noted that it is suitable only for those with a strong yang organ, those who actually have fire evil, and those with robust spleen and stomach energy who tolerate excess warmth. Only they can withstand it, and they depend on its cooling effects, which are not without benefits. If taken by those whose energy is already deficient, it will likely deplete their energy further; if taken by those without real fire, it will undermine their yang. Generally, individuals who are naturally weak, aged, in poor health, or with inadequate diets are unaware of the risks and often misuse it. They typically exacerbate the hidden yin, weaken their stomach energy, and are susceptible to symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and severe cold conditions. Adding Huanglian further increases the coldness, while Houpo and Peiling, which break up qi, are not advisable. Users must be cautious!<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

During hot months, external wind-cold may impede yang energy, leading to symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, lack of sweating, chilliness, and tight pulse. This belongs to the category of cold damage and is treated primarily with dispersing methods. Suitable prescriptions include Chaihu Decoction, Xiao Chaihu Decoction, or similar variations, adjusted according to the cold and heat, deficiency and excess of the condition. </p>
<p>If there is external pathogenic influence and internal heat, cooling dispersal is necessary. </p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 qian of Chaihu, </li>
<li>2 qian of Shaoyao, </li>
<li>1.5 qian each of Huangqin, Chenpi (with white pith retained), and Shengdi, </li>
<li>0.8 qian of licorice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add 1.5 sheng of water and simmer down to 7-8 parts; take warm. </p>
<p>For severe internal heat, add 1-2 qian of Lianqiao as needed. If the external pathogen is more severe, add 1 qian of Fangfeng as an adjunct. </p>
<p>If the pathogen is constrained in the chest, leading to fullness and discomfort, remove Shengdi and add 1-2 qian of Zhishi. If heat is at Yangming and accompanies thirst, add 1-2 qian of Tianhuafen or Gegeng. If heat is very intense, add Zhimu or Shigao as well.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Three Chaihu Decoction:</strong> The number three corresponds to the wood element, relating to the liver and blood. This treats exterior wind-cold in the hot months for individuals who traditionally have insufficient yin, or who may have little liver blood, thus can both nourish and disperse. However, for those with weak blood energy that cannot be expressed externally, this prescription should be prioritized. </p>
<p>Ingredients: 2-3 qian of Chaihu, 1 qian each of roasted licorice and aged tangerine peel (white part only), 1.5 qian of peony root, 3-5 slices of fresh ginger, 2 qian of angelica, and for those with loose stools, replace with cooked rehmannia. Use 1.5 sheng of water, decoct until reduced by 7-8 parts, and take warm.</p>
<p><strong>Four Chaihu Decoction:</strong> The number four corresponds to the metal element, relating to the qi aspect. This is for individuals with insufficient primal qi, or those who endure hunger and fatigue, experiencing exterior wind-cold during the hot months, or presenting with tight, rapid, and thin pulses, unable to withstand pathogenic factors. This prescription must bolster primal qi, while also dispersing, to protect overall health. It should be prioritized to prevent preceding loss of primal qi by solely focusing on dispersing pathogens. </p>
<p>Ingredients: 1-2-3 qian of Chaihu, 1 qian of roasted licorice, 3-5-7 slices of fresh ginger, 2-3 qian of angelica (use less if there are loose stools), and 2-3 qian or 5-7 qian of ginseng.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heat stroke without consciousness: One ounce of soap pod, burnt to retain its essence, one ounce of licorice, lightly roasted and powdered, mixed with warm water to administer one qian.</p>
<p>Heat stroke with fainting: In summer, if a person dies from heat while on the road, urgently move them to a shaded area, scoop hot soil from the path to cover their abdomen, let them urinate until warmth penetrates the abdomen, then administer remedies like earth paste or garlic water. Lin Yi says: This method comes from Zhang Zhongjing, its intention is exceptional, beyond the reach of ordinary circumstances, and is truly a great emergency technique. The abdomen is the root of life, and heat stroke damages qi, thus warming the abdomen is meant to reconnect it with original energy.</p>
<p>For heat stroke fatalities, one must not allow the person to cool down; if they cool down, they will die. Treatments include bending grass around the person’s abdomen, with two or three others urinating in it to warm them. Hot mud mixed with bent grass can also be used, or the bottom of a ceramic bowl pressed against the person, encouraging them to urinate, and ensuring the warmth flows away. This is called treatment when water is scarce and urgent; one must warm them with others urinating into it. If there is available water, it can be given, but mud and vehicle water should be avoided due to their coldness. Since heat strokes occur in summer, hot mud can be used, and warming vehicle water is also acceptable.</p>
<p>Heat exhaustion with lethargy: One cup of earth yellow juice should be taken.</p>
<p>For children suffering from heat stroke with vomiting, diarrhea, and thirst: Use valley essence grass, burnt to retain its essence, cover it with a container, cool it down and powder it; each time give half a qian mixed with cooled rice drink.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: In the summer, maintain balance by exhaling to release heat and inhaling to harmonize the heart. Avoid eating foods that excite the heart and avoid foul air that affects the spirit. After midnight on the summer solstice, a yin energy arises from the earth. Do not eat cold foods in extreme heat, as they may provoke cold disorders. Also, avoid activities in the bedroom, as they can drain vital energy from the command point of life. In hot summer days, it is beneficial to nourish the heart to prevent autumn ailments. It is advisable to drink Liu Yi Deng Xin soup or cardamom and patchouli water, and avoid direct exposure to strong winds after heavy drinking. Being cautious in these matters will prevent illness.</p>
<p>In case of heatstroke, first drink hot tea or soup, keep the neck straight, roll the tongue against the upper palate, clench the hands into fists, and tighten the toes. This will naturally induce sweating and promote recovery.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Rites of Confucianism,&quot; there was a young man named Zheng, fifteen years old, who suffered from heatstroke while in the fields. He had a headache and was unable to rise from bed. A practitioner administered a remedy to dispel sweat, and also gave him a rice vinegar soup, but it did not relieve his condition. Later in the evening, he was given a large dose of a pill made from the three divine flowers, which led to his recovery.</p>
<p>Another case involved an elder named Zhang, aged seventy-one, who also suffered during the hot months while working in the fields due to hunger and heat exhaustion. He had no appetite, frequently vomited, and had a continuous flow of phlegm from his mouth, along with pain in his abdomen and sides. The physician initially prescribed several remedies including Pingwei Powder, Lizhong Pill, and Daogqi Pill, but they were ineffective. Acupuncture was also applied, with the diagnosis that his stomach was cold. The practitioner consulted with another healer, who indicated that phlegm was related to the stomach, which was too hot and did not absorb properly, resulting in a flow of phlegm. Given the patient’s advanced age, he dared not use strong remedies that could cause a surge. Instead, he used a chopstick to probe, which caused the elder to expel a liter of phlegm without the use of medicine. Afterwards, he administered Huanglian Qingxin Powder, Daoyin Pill, and Yulu Powder to adjust the balance, which improved his appetite. However, he still had constipation, so a decoction made from fresh ginger and jujube was prepared to aid his digestion. He ultimately recovered.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: There are individuals who suffer from headaches and fever, feel irritated and thirsty, and upon examining their pulse, it is large and weak. I prescribed Baihu Decoction for several doses, and they recovered. Zhongjing states: A weak pulse and fever indicate a condition caused by summer heat. He also mentions that the pulse may be slender, thin, and slow. Why is this? The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: Cold injures the body, while heat injures the qi. If the qi is harmed without affecting the body, the qi diminishes, leading to a weak pulse. What is referred to as slender, thin, and slow is all classified as a weak pulse. Zhongjing associates the slender pulse with yin, and Zhu Pang also states that a weak pulse arising from heatstroke indicates weakness.</p>
<p>In the year Gui Chou, my old friend Wang Yanlong served as a magistrate in Lingcang. In late summer, he fell ill with excessive sweating in the chest and neck, and cold limbs, speaking incoherently. The physicians were ignorant of the condition, and mixed various medicines over a period of ten days. Upon examining him, I found his pulse damp in the front and rapid in the back. I said: He should be treated for damp heat. This is due to having been affected by heat and then dampness; the combination of summer heat and dampness is termed damp heat. First, I administered Baihu Decoction with ginseng, followed by Baihu Decoction with Atractylodes, and gradually the headache receded, his feet became warm, sweating ceased, and he fully recovered in three days. This situation shows the danger of hidden evils when improperly using medicine, which leads to death.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Outside the Baoping Gate, there was an inn run by someone with the surname Jiang, who was known for his singing and was loved by Sun. Suddenly, after a few days of not seeing him, Sun sent someone to inquire. Jiang responded: &quot;I&#39;ve been ill for a long time, and my life is about to end.&quot; </p>
<p>Sun examined him and found his body to be moist all over, his legs cold up to the knees, his abdomen distended, and he was unresponsive. His pulse was weak and rapid. When asked about the medicine he had been taking, Sun looked and found it was all medicine for yin diseases. Sun said, &quot;This is not due to a serious illness; rather, the medication has worsened your condition.&quot; </p>
<p>He then prescribed Wuling San and more than ten doses of Baihu Tang, and the illness slightly improved; after further treatment, he was completely healed. Once Jiang was well, he visited Sun to express his gratitude and asked, &quot;When I was severely ill, a single treatment restored me; I wish to know the method of your treatment.&quot; </p>
<p>Sun replied, &quot;Your illness resulted from heat injury. Initially, you experienced a slight yang collapse and a weak pulse. Other doctors regarded it as a yin disease and treated it with yin medicine, which resulted in your fainting. I used Wuling San, which greatly facilitated urination, thereby reducing your abdominal distension, and Baihu Tang cleared away the pathological heat, leading to your recovery. In general, when suffering from a yin disease, if the shins are cold, the arms will also be cold. Since your shins are cold but your arms are not, it indicates a slight yang collapse and upward rise, hence I discerned it was a case of yang collapse.&quot;<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Miraculous and Effective Remedies&quot; states: In the second year of Chongning, I was appointed to serve in the transport department and suffered from dysentery for two months during summer and autumn, going to the toilet thirty to forty times a day and night. However, there was more blood than pus, and famous doctors all declared it was dysentery. I heard that Li Zhonghe, a teaching assistant in Qingyang Town, was good at medicine, so I sent someone to summon him. When Zhonghe arrived and felt my pulse, he immediately said, &quot;This is not dysentery.&quot; I was initially very angry and pressed him further. Li replied, &quot;With more blood than pus, and scanty urination, it is indeed not dysentery.&quot; His words resonated with my condition, and I was already convinced. This was caused by a prior heat-stroke, transferring to the large intestine through the heart channel, thus transforming into blood and appearing like dysentery during bowel movements. The remedy is simply to allow the urine and stool to return to their respective organs. Crush coast grass into pieces the size of rice grains or grind it into fine powder. For the crushed pieces, take three qian each time with one cup of water, boil to seven-tenths concentration, and take warm; for the fine powder, take two qian each time, following the same method for boiling, and take one dose after meals and one before bed. Thus, I came to trust that there are such miraculous doctors in the world.

Why, then, distinguish them by movement and stillness? Indeed, heat stroke often occurs in laborers; the exertion makes them weak, and weakness allows pathogens to enter, causing illness.

Humans are spiritually connected to these matters; in form, they partake in the cosmos, thus becoming a triad with Heaven and Earth, facilitated by their correct acquisition of qi. Therefore, when qi rises, people also rise, when qi floats, they also float; when qi descends, they descend, and when qi sinks, they also sink. Humanity shares this fundamental key with Heaven and Earth. In the first month of the lunar calendar, yin is born, representing the initial movement of yang; in the third month, yang emerges from the earth, marking the ascent of qi. In the sixth month, when yang fully emerges from above, it signifies the floating of qi. The abdomen of a person is connected to the earth's qi, which at this time floats to the skin's surface, leading to a void in the abdomen. The classic text states: \"In summer, the meridians are full, the earth’s qi overflows, meridians receive blood, and the skin is filled.\" During the long summer, qi resides in the muscles, hence the surface is full, and when the surface is full, the interior must be deficient.

If the person is fundamentally strong, robust, and without any signs of deficiency or illness, it is advisable to dispel summer heat and harmonize the middle. For those residing in high, spacious buildings, if they suffer from what appears to be a heat syndrome related to the heart and spleen meridians, it is termed heatstroke, a yin condition; while those engaged in outdoor activities, experiencing symptoms similar to a cold syndrome related to the bladder meridian, it is termed sunstroke, which is a yang condition; yet in essence, they are the same. However, when discussing heat exposure, it is referred to as heatstroke, whereas when referring to being pressured by the sun, it is called sunstroke. At the onset of heat, it enters through the mouth, nose, teeth, and cheeks, reaching the palms, thereby producing heat from heat. Hence, ancient methods to dispel summer heat include using cool water for irrigation, though it should not be swallowed. When it enters the liver, it causes dizziness and stiffness; when it enters the spleen, it results in faintness and unawareness; when it enters the lungs, it leads to cough, wheezing, and debilitation; and when it enters the kidneys, it causes excessive thirst, not limited to affecting the heart but impacting multiple organs as well."},{"anchor":"trans-45p","marker":"45p","type":"translation","text":"**Distinguishing Heatstroke and Heat Invasion** Heatstroke brings the heart to a lethargic state, leading to fainting.

When heat invades the stomach and intestines, it results in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. \"Hidden heat\" refers to heat that has invaded for a long duration and becomes concealed within the three burners of the stomach and intestines, damaging the vital energy without harming the form. Over a period of weeks or months, it may lead to fluctuating cold and heat, resulting in symptoms such as cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, intermittent fevers, thirst, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool.

Thus, can we say that those who suffer from heat while traveling are experiencing it at rest? The terms \"movement\" and \"rest\" can only distinguish between external influences and internal injuries. If one becomes ill due to movement, it is an external reaction to the heat of the sun; if one becomes ill due to resting, it is an injury from avoiding the sun’s heat only to suffer from dampness, wind, dew, and the consumption of cold fruits. During the seasons of minor and major cold, those who are affected suffer from cold illnesses; during the minor and major heat seasons, those who are affected suffer from heat illnesses. Laborious people, exposed to cold and heat, are thus more prone to cold and heat-related illnesses.

The Yiyuan Powder drives out dampness through urination, and taking it in the summer alleviates heat, and this has been known for a long time. However, it is suitable for those whose bodies are full of dampness. For those with a lean and moist-free physique, their bodily fluids are consumed by seasonal changes, and they should use the Shengmai Powder to replenish their fluids. If they use Yiyuan recklessly to promote urination, they will deplete their lower sources, leading to dryness and deprivation. Moreover, the dampness induced by summer heat often coexists with underlying cold in overweight individuals, which can lead to severe symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, cold sweats, and life-threatening conditions. Relying solely on Yiyuan Powder to relieve heat and drive out dampness often exacerbates the situation, ultimately compromising organ function. Is it not crucial to discern its use with care? Furthermore, whenever there is excessive sweating, one should avoid promoting urination. This is vital, as the only bodily fluids in the stomach are this moisture. Once it leaks out and flows downward, it can be termed an approach that leads to depletion. Zhongjing referred to this condition as \"no yang,\" and if their pulse is short, rapid, and weak, that indicates a departure from vitality.

When the yang qi is weak and inert over time, while yin cold has long been in effect, upon suddenly encountering intense heat, the evil harmonizes with this deficiency, which is how humid heat disease arises from deficiency and cold. It is best to use warming medicines that also clear the heat, which is the most difficult to address. Danxi stated: \"Fire transforms gold into molten stone; what is there of cold?\" This assertion seems overly one-sided and cannot avoid mistakes in two or three out of ten cases. Just as the snow atop Mount Emei has never melted, how can it be said that all temples are hot in summer due to this misconception? In the human body, if there is accumulated yin to the extent that even boiling water cannot warm it, how is this different? The Inner Canon states: \"Seek what is lacking, and hold accountable what is deficient.\" This shows that we must not only seek and hold accountable for what is present and real. In my humble opinion, the Dahuang Long Wan can effectively revive those who have fainted due to heat stroke; isn’t that an example?

In summer, the yang of the human body leaks out through sweat, while the yin is consumed internally due to heat, resulting in a deficiency of both yin and yang. Zhongjing prohibited the use of sweating, purging, and warming needles in cases of draught illnesses because sweating harms the yang, purging injures the yin, and warming needles provoke internal heat, hence their ban. Instead, treatment focuses solely on using sweet and cold medicines that nourish fluids, protect the lungs, bolster the yang, and enrich the yin. The relationship between these factors is crucial, which is why I have highlighted this. The \"Lingshu\" states: When both yin and yang are deficient, replenishing yang exhausts yin, while draining yin leads to the loss of yang. This means that yang relies on yin as its home, so when replenishing yang, one must not harm yin; conversely, yin depends on yang as its root, so draining yin must not disrupt yang. When both yin and yang are deficient, one must be cautious about supplementation and draining; any efforts risk leaning too much toward one side, like an excess of yin or yang, resulting only in minute discrepancies. Therefore, excessive use of sweet and warm substances risks transgressing the caution against replenishing yang, while excessive bitter and cold substances could violate the caution against draining yin. However, when using a combination of sweet and cold—medications that do not favor either yin or yang—one can effectively clear and resolve summer heat.

These two formulas are not recorded in the chapter on cold-induced spasm due to damp heat in \"Shanghan Lun\" but appear again in the chapter on spasm due to damp heat in \"Jinkui Yao Lue.\" Recognizing the subtle yet critical distinctions is essential. Regarding White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng, the text states: when there is internal heat in the Taiyang stage, this is termed \"heat stroke.\" The person sweats and feels cold, has a fever and thirst; White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng is indicated. Indeed, those who sweat and feel cold in summer have a deficiency of the defensive qi. Fever and thirst indicate that lung metal has been dried out by the fire's control. The \"Huangdi Neijing\" says: when the heart transfers heat to the lungs, it causes dryness in the diaphragm. This state also leads to thirst.

Zhang Zhongjing understood this concept, stating that middle heat also involves middle dampness, which has a relation. However, if water moves in the skin, why is the pulse seen as weak? It is because the middle heat pulse is originally weak, and dampness resides in the skin, internally connecting with the lungs, obstructing the flow of nutrients and defenses, causing the pulse to appear even weaker.

In general, consuming cold drinks injures the lungs, and the damage accumulates over time. This moisture mainly harms the skin associated with the lungs, so addressing it effectively requires only a small adjustment rather than relying heavily on red adzuki beans or sour jujube water.

If people fear heat and crave coolness without avoiding cold drafts, they may find themselves in deep halls or under shady trees, or during times when it’s both hot and cold, not being careful with their clothing. This can lead to cold pathogens invading the surface of the body, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, chills without sweating, stiff body, and aching limbs. This condition, caused by cold exposure in summer, is labeled as yin heat, corresponding to wind-cold disease. The main treatment should focus on warming and dispersing, using methods for treating wind-cold.

The treatment should focus on discerning the vacuity or solidity of the qi, and the mildness or severity of the fire, either supplementing or clearing to stabilize the qi.

The names for cold injuries differ: in winter’s cold, it is called true cold injury; in the warmth of spring, it is called warm disease; and in summer’s heat, it is termed heat disease. Warm disease and heat disease are simply different names for cold injury. The classic texts state: \"In winter, one is injured by cold; in spring, one will surely fall ill with warmth.\" It is also said: \"Any illness caused by cold that turns into warmth, if it occurs before the summer solstice, is warm disease; if after, it is heat disease.\" This is the distinction made. Heat injury also has differences: if one is impacted by heat and subsequently feels cold, that cold injures the body, thus it is cold injury. If one is affected by heat and then suffers from heat, that heat injures the qi, thus it is heat injury. This refers to injuries from within or affects from without, but there are simply different types of heat disease.

In the summer months when the heat is intense, one must ensure that the body has a slight sweat, as this is the most appropriate way to nourish the body during this season. If one insists on being completely dry without sweating, it tends to result in an excess of yin over yang, leading to various illnesses. Observing the classics, it is stated: \"Heat should be accompanied by sweating; do not suppress it.\" This indicates that sweating during heat should not be hindered. It is also stated: \"If sweating does not occur during summer heat, it will lead to autumn's wind and fever.\" This highlights that a lack of sweating during summer heat can be a disease. Thus, the appropriateness of sweating in the summer can be understood. There are eight signs of heatstroke: weak pulse, spontaneous sweating, body heat, coldness in the back, facial dirtiness, restlessness and thirst, slightly cold hands and feet, and a feeling of heaviness in the body. In treating these conditions, it is crucial to prioritize the regulation of the original qi, followed by clearing and benefiting.

He discusses that humans share a connection with Heaven and Earth. In the first month (Zi), Yang is born, and it begins to move; in the third month (Yin), three Yangs are born, and Yang first emerges from the ground. This represents the rising energy. In the sixth month (Si), six Yangs are born, and Yang fully emerges above, signifying the floating energy. The human abdomen corresponds to the Earth's energy and at this time, it floats at the surface of the skin, dispersing into the dermis, rendering the abdomen empty. People say that the hidden Yin is within during the summer months, and this notion of Yin implies emptiness. If one interprets it merely as coldness, it leads to significant misunderstandings. Moreover, during this period, Yang is abundant above ground, burning and scorching, flowing like molten gold and dazzling like stone; how can there be anything cold or Yin?

It also states: Qi that is abundant is hot, while qi that is deficient is cold. This is the fundamental nature of yin and yang. Now, since it is said that in summer the yang floats outside, then the yin must be hidden within. When yin is strong, yang is weak; how can it not be cold? When yang floats outside, qi is deficient inside; how can it not be cold? This is a principle that is inherently unchanging. However, what is even more evident can be seen in the water of wells and springs: during the harsh cold of three winters, the well water is warm; during the scorching heat of midsummer, the spring water is cold. Is this not a clear example of external cold and internal heat, or external heat and internal cold? This holds true year after year and represents the constant seasons of qi.

Moreover, should we claim that due to the fire of summer months, there is no cold, and thus prohibit the use of warmth? The principle of伏阴 (hidden yin) essentially refers to the interplay of yin and yang in relation to cold and heat; if one were to merely treat the word \"cold\" as void, then in summer, hidden yin would imply many void syndromes, while in winter, with hidden yang, there would be none remaining—could it be so? Further, if in summer, warmth should be prohibited, then in winter, cold should equally be banned—this is simply self-evident. Now, observing the ailments across the four seasons, it is clear that in midsummer there are often many cases of vomiting and diarrhea, while in the depths of winter, rashes and sores are particularly evident.

In that case, Mencius’s advice to drink soup in winter and water in summer would also be untrustworthy, wouldn't it? Alas!

Avoid eating foods that excite the heart and avoid foul air that affects the spirit. After midnight on the summer solstice, a yin energy arises from the earth. Do not eat cold foods in extreme heat, as they may provoke cold disorders. Also, avoid activities in the bedroom, as they can drain vital energy from the command point of life. In hot summer days, it is beneficial to nourish the heart to prevent autumn ailments. It is advisable to drink Liu Yi Deng Xin soup or cardamom and patchouli water, and avoid direct exposure to strong winds after heavy drinking. Being cautious in these matters will prevent illness. In case of heatstroke, first drink hot tea or soup, keep the neck straight, roll the tongue against the upper palate, clench the hands into fists, and tighten the toes.

He had a headache and was unable to rise from bed. A practitioner administered a remedy to dispel sweat, and also gave him a rice vinegar soup, but it did not relieve his condition. Later in the evening, he was given a large dose of a pill made from the three divine flowers, which led to his recovery. Another case involved an elder named Zhang, aged seventy-one, who also suffered during the hot months while working in the fields due to hunger and heat exhaustion. He had no appetite, frequently vomited, and had a continuous flow of phlegm from his mouth, along with pain in his abdomen and sides. The physician initially prescribed several remedies including Pingwei Powder, Lizhong Pill, and Daogqi Pill, but they were ineffective. Acupuncture was also applied, with the diagnosis that his stomach was cold. The practitioner consulted with another healer, who indicated that phlegm was related to the stomach, which was too hot and did not absorb properly, resulting in a flow of phlegm. Given the patient’s advanced age, he dared not use strong remedies that could cause a surge. Instead, he used a chopstick to probe, which caused the elder to expel a liter of phlegm without the use of medicine. Afterwards, he administered Huanglian Qingxin Powder, Daoyin Pill, and Yulu Powder to adjust the balance, which improved his appetite. However, he still had constipation, so a decoction made from fresh ginger and jujube was prepared to aid his digestion. He ultimately recovered."},{"anchor":"trans-110p","marker":"110p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Medical Guidelines\" states: There are individuals who suffer from headaches and fever, feel irritated and thirsty, and upon examining their pulse, it is large and weak. I prescribed Baihu Decoction for several doses, and they recovered. Zhongjing states: A weak pulse and fever indicate a condition caused by summer heat. He also mentions that the pulse may be slender, thin, and slow. Why is this? The \"Plain Questions\" states: Cold injures the body, while heat injures the qi. If the qi is harmed without affecting the body, the qi diminishes, leading to a weak pulse. What is referred to as slender, thin, and slow is all classified as a weak pulse. Zhongjing associates the slender pulse with yin, and Zhu Pang also states that a weak pulse arising from heatstroke indicates weakness. In the year Gui Chou, my old friend Wang Yanlong served as a magistrate in Lingcang. In late summer, he fell ill with excessive sweating in the chest and neck, and cold limbs, speaking incoherently. The physicians were ignorant of the condition, and mixed various medicines over a period of ten days. Upon examining him, I found his pulse damp in the front and rapid in the back. I said: He should be treated for damp heat. This is due to having been affected by heat and then dampness; the combination of summer heat and dampness is termed damp heat. First, I administered Baihu Decoction with ginseng, followed by Baihu Decoction with Atractylodes, and gradually the headache receded, his feet became warm, sweating ceased, and he fully recovered in three days.

His pulse was weak and rapid. When asked about the medicine he had been taking, Sun looked and found it was all medicine for yin diseases. Sun said, \"This is not due to a serious illness; rather, the medication has worsened your condition.\" He then prescribed Wuling San and more than ten doses of Baihu Tang, and the illness slightly improved; after further treatment, he was completely healed. Once Jiang was well, he visited Sun to express his gratitude and asked, \"When I was severely ill, a single treatment restored me; I wish to know the method of your treatment.\" Sun replied, \"Your illness resulted from heat injury. Initially, you experienced a slight yang collapse and a weak pulse. Other doctors regarded it as a yin disease and treated it with yin medicine, which resulted in your fainting. I used Wuling San, which greatly facilitated urination, thereby reducing your abdominal distension, and Baihu Tang cleared away the pathological heat, leading to your recovery. In general, when suffering from a yin disease, if the shins are cold, the arms will also be cold.

However, there was more blood than pus, and famous doctors all declared it was dysentery. I heard that Li Zhonghe, a teaching assistant in Qingyang Town, was good at medicine, so I sent someone to summon him. When Zhonghe arrived and felt my pulse, he immediately said, \"This is not dysentery.\" I was initially very angry and pressed him further. Li replied, \"With more blood than pus, and scanty urination, it is indeed not dysentery.\" His words resonated with my condition, and I was already convinced. This was caused by a prior heat-stroke, transferring to the large intestine through the heart channel, thus transforming into blood and appearing like dysentery during bowel movements. The remedy is simply to allow the urine and stool to return to their respective organs. Crush coast grass into pieces the size of rice grains or grind it into fine powder. For the crushed pieces, take three qian each time with one cup of water, boil to seven-tenths concentration, and take warm; for the fine powder, take two qian each time, following the same method for boiling, and take one dose after meals and one before bed.
