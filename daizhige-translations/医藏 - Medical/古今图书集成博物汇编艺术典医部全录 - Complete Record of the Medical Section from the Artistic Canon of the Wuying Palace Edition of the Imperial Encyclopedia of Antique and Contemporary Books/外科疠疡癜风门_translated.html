<p><strong>External Diseases, Boils, and Vitiligo: [White Spots (Disease)]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Plain Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>When the wind and the sun both enter, they traverse the meridian, dispersing among the flesh and sinews, interacting with the defensive qi. If the pathways are obstructed, it causes the muscles to become swollen and result in sores; when the defensive qi stagnates and does not flow, the flesh becomes insensate. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: The pathways of the defensive qi being obstructed leads to swollen muscles and the formation of boils; when the defensive qi stagnates in the neck and back, it cannot circulate through the skin and flesh, resulting in numbness and insensitivity to pain and itchiness.]</strong></p>
<p>When a pestilence (lethargy) attaches itself to the nutrient qi, if this qi is impure, it causes the nasal bridge to decay and the complexion to deteriorate, resulting in skin ulcers and sores. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: Wind injures the nutrient qi, combining with heat, which arises from the flesh; therefore, the internal and external qi of the muscles becomes impure. When the wind evil interacts with the nutrient and defensive qi on the surface, it leads to the impurity of these energies, causing the nasal bridge to collapse, the complexion to become foul, and leading to skin ulcers and leprosy.]</strong></p>
<p>When wind and cold remain in the pulse without departing, it is called pestilent wind, or it may also be referred to as cold and heat. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: When the evil of wind and cold lingers within the pulse, causing injury to the nutrient qi, it is also called pestilent wind. Nutrient ailments then present with cold, heat, and reduced energy, hence it may also be called cold and heat.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The wind of illness manifests as a plague.<br>[Note: The plague refers to severe diseases like leprosy. Wind is an external yang heat pathogen, while blood is an internal yin dampness. Damp heat breeds parasites, thus, when wind enters the pulse, it can eventually transform into the afflictions of leprosy.]</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Severe Illness from Great Wind</strong></p>
<p>Severe illness from great wind presents in various forms. Initially, although the body shows no apparent abnormalities, the eyebrows and facial hair may have fallen out; or the body may be entirely compromised while the eyebrows and facial hair remain intact; or there may be no signs on the body while certain areas like limbs and back exhibit persistent issues, with severe cases resulting in the fingers of hands and feet falling off. Some may suffer from great cold but find that heavy clothing does not warm them; others may experience common heat illnesses that cannot find relief. There are those whose bodies appear emaciated; some sweat profusely without cessation; others experience dry, itching skin that feels gritty, with scratches revealing white patches like flour, while others develop sores. Some have painful injuries that overlap and cause suffering continuously day and night; there are also those who are numb and unaware of pain or itching. The colors of these ailments vary as well: there are shades of blue, yellow, red, white, and black; some may be bright and withered, others dark and dull.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Although the types and appearances of these conditions vary, whether difficult or easy to treat, all is in the hands of those before us, not the healers. Why is this? Once afflicted, regardless of whether one is wise or foolish, communication becomes difficult. Why? The mouth may follow, but the heart diverges; one does not accept the teachings of medicine but merely hopes for the power of medicine, failing to seek within oneself. Thus, whether the condition is difficult or easy to treat relies on those before us, not on medicine. I have personally treated over six hundred people, and among those healed, only one in ten succeeded, for I cared for each one personally, leading to my deep understanding. I find it difficult to communicate, and if one does not accept the treatment, there is no need for healing, for there will inevitably be setbacks. If the illness does not heal, then the effort is in vain. Additionally, the &quot;Records of Immortals&quot; mention several dozen individuals who, due to severe illnesses, attained the path to immortality. Why is this? All of them cast aside worldly burdens and embraced the winds of Yang. Therefore, it is not merely about healing the body but also about transforming misfortune into fortune.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Therefore, among the illnesses I have seen, there are many notable figures, including local lords and even distinguished individuals of different backgrounds, who when faced with such afflictions, are deeply attached to their wives and children, unable to cut their ties, continually hoping for the efficacy of drugs and unwilling to seek healing from within themselves. If they could sever their desires and abandon their attachments, not only would they recover from their illnesses, but they could also attain immortality. I have often asked patients, and they all say: &quot;Our own unkind deeds have long led us into extreme degradation, yet we still wish to continue on this path.&quot; Even though they express regret, they lack true repentance. However, if they can renew themselves, heed their teacher&#39;s instructions, and take the medicinal remedies, what is there that cannot be healed? During the Zhenguan era, I took a sick patient into the mountains and taught him to take pine resin, which he continued for a hundred days, and he regained his vitality. From this, it is evident that the pursuit of healing must come from within; one cannot solely rely on medicine.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>There are those who suffer from stubborn physical ailments for many years, ashamed to face their wives, not revealing the truth to them. Eventually, the illness worsens, becoming evident, and they claim it was caused by improper medication. This is all self-deception. Although this illness is serious, it can be treated at an early stage and may lead to immediate recovery. Once contracted, those far away rarely survive more than ten years, while those nearby may pass away in five or six years. Yet, those afflicted believe they will live a hundred years, which is truly tragic! Upon encountering this illness, one must immediately stop consuming salt and regularly intake pine resin; all public and private affairs should be let go, as if discarding an old shoe. Any and all flavors must be eliminated; one should avoid worldly matters and sever ties with festivities and condolences, seeking solitude in remote valleys, where recovery may take a year. After recovery, one must be cautious in sexual matters, as any transgression may lead to a recurrence. This illness has both auspicious and inauspicious implications; if one cultivates goodness upon being afflicted, it will be fortunate; conversely, if one continues to follow worldly ways, it will surely be disastrous.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Epidemic wind leads to the vitality and heat of the spirit being disturbed, causing the nose to decay in color, and the skin to develop sores and ulcers. This occurs when the wind and cold invade the pulse and do not leave, which is termed epidemic wind. It is also said that the pulse of wind transforms into an epidemic, commonly referred to as leprosy. Therefore, the treatment method states: great wind leads to heavy joints, drooping of the eyebrows, which is called great wind. Needling the muscles causes sweating for a hundred days. Wang’s commentary states: it releases the stagnant heat of the protective Qi. Needling the bone marrow induces sweating for a hundred days. It releases the stagnant heat of the nourishing Qi. Generally, after three days, white eyebrows appear and then the needling is stopped. The stagnant heat is expelled, the yin energy returns within, thus leading to more sweating and the appearance of white eyebrows. Begin with birch bark powder, starting with a small amount and gradually increasing; after five to seven days, moxibustion on the Chengjiang point seven times, moxibustion on the sores lightly and repeat if necessary, and continue until the sores heal; then take the Ersheng powder to eliminate heat and expel the wind evil from the blood. Avoid marital relations for three years.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Acupuncture and medicine stop describing forms based on symbols; this is the method for treating wind in the lungs. However, it is not limited to the lungs alone. It is commonly said that the nose belongs to the lungs, and when the disease manifests at the end of the lungs, it is often interpreted that if the nose swells, becomes red, and inflamed, it is simply a type of sore. This is because blood follows the transformation of qi; if qi does not transform, then blood accumulates. Once blood accumulates, it causes the flesh to rot and gives rise to worms. It is said that the jueyin (the liver) oversees the generation of five worms, and jueyin represents wind and wood, hence wood generates the five worms. The three jiaos (the body&#39;s functional units) are excessively hot and overpower the metal (lungs), which weakens the metal, allowing wood to invade and dominate; as the classics say: &quot;domination is superior.&quot; Therefore, it is wise to drain the heat and benefit the qi with appropriate medicine, and the worms will cease to arise. The principle states: &quot;Flowing water does not rot, and door hinges do not decay.&quot; This is what it means. Hence, the disease signifies blood heat. It should be treated with medicine to soothe and relieve; decocting the &quot;Sheng Ma Decoction&quot; and taking the &quot;Qian&#39;s Recipe for Draining Heat&quot; accordingly, as stated in the classics. Therefore, those with wind disease initially receive yang qi.</p>
<p><strong>Contagious Wind</strong></p>
<p>Contagious wind is characterized by a hot and unclear essence, leading to the deterioration of the nasal structure and discoloration, along with skin ulcers. Wind and cold invade the pulse and do not disperse, hence it is called contagious wind, or pulse wind, commonly referred to as leprosy. Treatment method: puncture the muscles for one hundred days, induce sweating for one hundred days; in total, two hundred days must pass for a beard to grow and then cease. Begin with birch bark powder, gradually increasing the amount, and take it for five to seven days. Moxibustion at the Chengjiang point with seven strong applications, if the sore heals, moxibustion again, and once healed, repeat this three times. Afterwards, take the &quot;Two Holy Powder&quot; to dispel the heat and expel the blood wind evil, refraining from bedroom activities for three years; in this way, the disease will be cured.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method [Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Disease Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The disease of great wind is caused by the lethal winds of heaven and earth; the ancients referred to it as pestilent wind due to its fierce and frightening nature. When someone contracts it, it must be categorized as affecting either the upper or lower body. For those affected in the upper body, one should use alcohol and herbal formulas to expel foul phlegm and blood from between the teeth; for those affected in the lower body, one should administer herbal remedies to eliminate harmful substances and stagnant matter from the intestinal tract. Although there are different pathways for expulsion, they all pertain to the Yangming channel. </p>
<p>To treat this disease, it is crucial to understand this principle. If the lumps and sores appear mainly in the upper body, then the condition is upper-focused; if they appear mainly in the lower body, then it is lower-focused; if both upper and lower are affected, then involvement is present in both areas. The Yangming channel encompasses the stomach and large intestine, and no substance is exempt from being processed. When this wind enters a person, if it primarily affects the qi, the upper body is more severely impacted; if it primarily affects the blood, the lower body is more severely impacted; if both qi and blood are affected, the condition is quite severe. Unless treated by a skilled physician and with the patient&#39;s undivided resolve, it is rare to escape from this affliction.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Some patients come either from above or below, gradually developing their illness. These are diseases that can be treated. People often overlook the slow progression of the disease; even if treatment is applied according to this method, the disease may completely leave the body. However, if one cannot abstain from flavors and colors, they will inevitably relapse, and once relapsed, there is no hope for recovery.</p>
<p>I have treated five people, of whom only one woman was spared, because she was extremely poor and had little to eat. The other four patients relapsed after three years. Master Sun once stated: I have treated four or five hundred people, and none have avoided death. It is not that Master Sun cannot heal; rather, no one can strictly adhere to the prohibitions.</p>
<p>This woman, despite her illness, also received over a hundred adjustments of the Four Substance Decoction. After more than six months, her menstrual cycle finally resumed, and she was completely cured.</p>
<p>This illness is not limited to the lungs; it arises in the nose and is commonly referred to as &quot;lung wind.&quot; The nose swells, becomes red, and enlarges, leading to sores and causing blood to congeal with qi. When qi is not flowing, blood accumulates; when blood accumulates, it causes the flesh to rot and breed worms. The generation of worms is governed by the Jue Yin. Using medicine to gently relieve and drain, I applied the prescribed Shang Ma Decoction and the Qing Pill for diarrhea, treating the remaining conditions according to their respective channels.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Epidemic Wind</strong></p>
<p>Epidemic wind refers to the pestilence noted in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; resulting from the harsh and lethal winds of heaven and earth, which are extremely fierce and fearsome. This condition may arise from various causes: first, due to wind poison, which can occur from sweating excessively while wearing wet clothes or being exposed to the wind after drinking; second, due to damp poison, which may result from sitting or lying on damp ground or being caught in rain and dew; third, due to contagion. However, it is not necessarily always from external sources. Internal injuries from diet, excessive heat toxins, severe cold or heat, and living in unclean conditions can also result in fire stirring blood heat and subsequently increasing susceptibility to external wind, cold, and dampness.</p>
<p>In the initial stages, one may experience superficial itching, or may develop white scales and purple patches resembling vitiligo, or purple blisters and nodules that ooze pus. When symptoms appear predominantly in the upper body, it indicates that the qi is affected and corresponds to more upper body involvement; when symptoms primarily manifest in the lower body, it indicates that the blood is affected and corresponds to more lower body involvement. If symptoms occur in both upper and lower body, both qi and blood are compromised. Conditions that ascend from the lower body to the upper body follow the pattern of &quot;reverse wind,&quot; while those descending from the upper to the lower body follow the pattern of &quot;normal wind.&quot; Those that manifest gradually from either direction can be treated, while sudden onset is more difficult to cure. </p>
<p>Mistakes in treatment may lead to skin death resulting in numbness, ceasing of pulses and blood turning to pus, death of muscle causing a lack of pain upon cutting, death of tendons leading to weakness in limbs, and death of bones causing the bridge of the nose to collapse. This could also result in drooping eyebrows, dimming vision, lips curling, speech becoming hoarse, and in extreme cases, corroding injuries to the eyes, decaying tissue, and contracted limbs. When the disease reaches this severity, it becomes nearly impossible to resolve.</p>
<p>The stomach and large intestine are capable of receiving everything. The spleen controls the muscles, and the lungs govern the skin. Though sores and scabs may be evident on the skin and flesh, the heat and toxins ultimately affect the stomach and intestines; thus, the treatment must first address the yangming region.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>At the onset, one should use Fangfeng Tongsheng San to dispel wind. For exterior toxins, use ephedra at the top, and for internal toxins, use nitrate and sulfur at the bottom. If both are present, use Shengliao Fangfeng Tongsheng San to resolve both exterior and interior. After three to five days, take Zuixian San to expel excessive saliva. After that, take Fangfeng Tongsheng San again, omitting nitrate, sulfur, and ephedra, and continue to take it frequently over a long period. Once the stomach&#39;s energy stabilizes, use Zaizao San to expel any remaining parasites. Moreover, if one prefers to expel parasites first and then the excessive saliva, after purging, continue using Fangfeng Tongsheng San, adjusting with additional ginseng, astragalus, and cooked rehmannia to stabilize energy and blood. If one has a weak spleen and stomach, the dosage of white atractylodes should be doubled.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Due to the excessive heat of the worms, the qi and blood boil and fill the meridians, causing external sores to spread; internally, the worms attack, eroding the liver, causing hair loss on the eyebrows, penetrating the heart and soles of the feet, leading to hoarseness due to harm to the spleen, nosebleeds from lung damage, and thunder-like tinnitus from kidney erosion. One should first take the Xieqing Pill to clear liver heat, and then treat according to the specific symptoms. For those with dryness and itchiness, use Siwu Decoction with wine and add floating duckweed powder, increasing the dosage of catnip and cicada shell for severe itchiness. For itchiness accompanied by skin lesions and white flakes, use the Baihua She Pill. For hair loss at the eyebrows, use San She Dan or a decoction of cypress leaves. For loss of eyebrows and nosebleeds, utilize Huanshu Powder and Buqi Xie Rong Decoction. If the eyes are eroded, use Aloe Pills. For weakened limbs and joints, apply Juanpi Powder. Common prescriptions include Lingxiao Flower Powder, Hu Ma Powder, Additive Ku Sheng Pills, Dafa Pills, Huangu Powder, Dama Feng Pills, Ziyun Feng Pills, Huoshendan, Shenqi Pills, Sisheng Buliao Dan, and Bawutang. For external treatment, use Mo Feng Ointment and bathing with skin-itching formulas. For hair loss without regrowth, first rub with fresh ginger three times, then apply powdered Banxia mixed with sesame oil for application. Choose from the various prescriptions as needed.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Treatment Method for Red and White Skin Spots</p>
<p>When the skin of the face, neck, and body changes color, the red spots are called &quot;red spots,&quot; and the white spots are &quot;white spots.&quot; These occur due to liver wind affecting the skin, resulting from disharmony of blood and qi. Red is associated with blood. For blood heat, use Jiuwu Qianghuo Decoction with honeysuckle and forsythia, or Four Substance Decoction with bupleurum, gardenia, and peony. For skin deficiency, use Xiaoyao Powder with gardenia or Shenqi Pill. White is associated with qi. For qi heat, use Baidu Powder or Small Chaihu Decoction with windproof and forsythia; for deficiency, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with Qianghuo and windproof. If it is due to wind toxin, use Huzhima Powder, Dan Cang&#39;er Pill, or Dan Fuping Pill. For chronic cases, it is best to nourish qi and blood, which will extinguish the fire, stabilize the wind, and stop the itching. If pungent and hot dispersing agents are used, it will only dry the liver blood, intensify the wind fire, and weaken the vital energy, making it difficult to treat. </p>
<p>For skin itch due to deficiency, where blood is not nourishing the pores, it is advisable to use Four Substance Decoction with Scutellaria, mixed with powdered violet for oral administration; or use powdered Lonicera flower with wine for oral administration. For widespread itching and dandruff on the scalp, use Dan Kusan Pill, or mix peppermint and cicada slough in equal parts, then take with wine.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When wind and cold penetrate together, they move through the pulse pathways, dispersing between the flesh and engaging with the protective qi. This obstructs their flow, causing the muscles and flesh to become strained and generate ulcers. When the protective qi coagulates and does not flow, the flesh becomes numb. With the presence of excessive heat in the nourishing and protective systems, the qi becomes unclear, resulting in the degradation of the nasal structure and skin ulcers. When wind and cold invade the pulse and do not depart, it is called pestilential wind. The treatment method should involve needling the muscles and bone marrow to release the excessive heat from the nourishing and protective systems. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; suggests using sharp needles to puncture and draw out the bad blood from swellings. Recent sages have stated that such disturbances arise from the malevolent qi brought forth by the changing of the seasons. If symptoms appear primarily in the upper body, the toxin is located above; if they appear mainly in the lower body, the toxin is below. It is thus understood that when the qi is affected by evil, it manifests more above, whereas when the blood is affected, it shows more below. If both qi and blood are affected, symptoms will appear in both the upper and lower parts.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>If the eyebrows fall first, the poison is in the lungs; if the face develops purple blisters, the poison is in the liver; if the soles of the feet ache or wear away first, the poison is in the kidneys; if the body is covered with sores, the poison is in the spleen; if the eyes are damaged first, the poison is in the heart. These are the serious conditions of the five organs. </p>
<p>First, the skin dies, leading to numbness; second, the flesh dies, resulting in insensitivity to needle pricks; third, the blood dies, causing ulceration; fourth, the tendons die, leading to dislocation of fingers; fifth, the bones die, resulting in nasal deterioration. These are injuries to the five organs that cannot be treated. If the voice becomes hoarse and the eyes go blind, it is particularly difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Generally, these conditions often stem from overexertion harming the Qi and blood, the pores not being tight, or from excess drinking, sexual activity, or bathing afterward, or from climbing mountains and fording waters, where external pathogens take advantage. The protective Qi clashes, damp heat transforms into fire, and blood turns into dryness due to fire, hence these ailments frequently occur in areas like Huaiyang, Lingnan, and Minyue.</p>
<p>Treatment should differentiate between original, accompanying, transformative, and similar conditions, as well as consider Yin and Yang, deficiency and excess. If one arbitrarily administers drying and heating treatments, resulting in profuse purulent discharge, it will further dry the liver&#39;s blood, intensify wind-heat, excessively harm the kidney&#39;s water, and amplify the fire of the heart, ultimately leading to deterioration of the condition.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>This is the treatment principle for pestilential sores.</p>
<p>Pestilential sores are not limited to a single organ; rather, the blood and qi associated with them are universally affected. Moreover, there are concurrent symptoms that may overlap. When these sores manifest externally after many years, it is crucial to differentiate between the upper and lower channels, as well as assess the deficiency or excess of the disease. One should not universally apply toxic medicines; instead, assistance should first be given to the stomach to strengthen qi, thereby solidifying the foundation before treating the sores.</p>
<p>The classics state: if true qi is lost, then there is deficiency; if evil qi is abundant, then there is excess. Whenever it is said that the disease belongs to excess, one should consider it as deficiency.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize the differences in variations and similarities of the pestilential sores, leading to different treatment methods such as sweating, purging, needling, and either attacking or tonifying. In this regard, it is essential to evaluate the severity of concurrent symptoms, observe the sequence of changing symptoms, and identify the authenticity of similar symptoms. The methods of sweating, purging, needling, attacking, and tonifying should also take into account the individual&#39;s deficiency or excess, and thoroughly investigate the source of the illness in order to administer treatment. The deficient state refers to a deficiency in both form and qi, while the excessive state indicates a condition of pathogenic qi being abundant at the expense of form and qi, which then becomes deficient.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The method of treating sores and ulcers involves an approach where one sweat can replace a thousand needles, as the effects of bleeding are not as widespread as those of sweating. However, sweating leads to bleeding, and bleeding leads to sweating; they are interconnected. If stagnant, toxic blood is trapped in the skin and meridians, one should use both needling and sweating; taking blood from the middle of the body will be effective. If the toxicity is lodged in the organs, one must clear it from within to achieve recovery. If the poison is external, one must needling all affected areas, as well as the spaces between the fingers, hands, and toes, to disperse the toxicity. If both the exterior and interior are affected, without external needling and internal discharge, the poison cannot recede. If there are extensive issues in the upper body, it is advisable to use the Zui Xian San formulation to expel the stagnant toxic blood from the gums, and to needle the spaces between the fingers and the wrists to remove the toxic blood from the surface. For extensive issues in the lower body, it is best to use the Zai Zao San formulation to expel stagnant blood and parasites through the digestive tract, and additionally needle the spaces between the toes and wrists, repeating the needling every couple of days until the blood turns red.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If there are symptoms like chills, fever, and headaches, one should greatly replenish blood and qi. For a plague sore treated with light powder, if there is abdominal pain accompanied by purulent matter after defecation, do not use medicine to stop it. If there is swelling and pain in the mouth and tongue, with foul water flowing intermittently, along with thirst and preference for coolness, this indicates a heat toxin in the upper burner; the remedy should be Xiaoyellow powder. If chills and fevers alternate, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Zhi Mu. If there is bleeding from the gums with heat and constipation, this is due to internal heat toxin; Huanglian Jiedu Decoction is appropriate. If the stool is well-formed, use Jisheng Xijiao Dihuang Decoction. If the foul water has ceased but the mouth and tongue do not heal, or if there is fever and thirst but no desire for cool drinks, this indicates deficiency heat, and Qiwwei Baizhu San should be employed. For plague sores affecting the hands, feet, legs, arms, or fingers, with cramping, this is due to intense yin fire depleting qi and blood; one should take Jiawei Xiaoyao San with Sheng Dihuang and combined Huanchang San.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>A sore that breeds worms occurs when the winds of the five directions converge, the fire of the heart overcomes the metal element, and the thriving wood transforms, internally consuming the five organs, revealing itself externally. It is advisable to use Shengma Decoction to send out Qing Pills or Birch Bark Powder, to clear the evils of the lung and liver; external moxibustion on Chengjiang to disperse the Yangming and Ren meridians will cease the wind-heat and prevent worms from arising. When there is deficiency heat in the liver channel, it should be complemented with Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder or Liuwei Dihuang Pills.</p>
<p>A sore that is not healed for a long time may arise from carelessness in daily activities and diet, leading to the internal fire being inappropriately stirred; from damage to the internal organs, resulting in fatigue of Qi and blood; from using aggressive medications that further deplete Qi and blood; from failing to distinguish between mixed symptoms, resulting in improper medication; or from the patient being unwilling to acknowledge their illness or seek treatment.</p>
<p>A sore that heals and then relapses may occur due to indulging in rich foods, harming the spleen with internal heat; from excess sexual activity leading to kidney damage; from uncontrolled emotions causing harm to blood and Qi; from lingering toxins causing a mixed syndrome; or from Qi deficiency being invaded by the six excesses from the outside. The ancients said: This condition is rarely cured. That is precisely this.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Combined Evidence of Governance Methods</strong></p>
<p>When feeling lightheaded: If the right pulse at the inch is floating and weak, it indicates deficiency of spleen and lung qi; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If the left pulse at the guan and chi is rapid and weak, it indicates deficiency of liver and kidney qi; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the right pulse at the inch and chi is floating, large, and slightly weak, it indicates deficiency of yang qi; use Ba Wei Di Huang Wan. For blood deficiency, use Si Wu Decoction with additional ginseng, poria, and white atractylodes. For qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Decoction with added angelica and astragalus.

If spleen qi has phlegm, use Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Decoction. For excessive blood loss, use Xiong Gui Decoction. For fever and chills, use Sheng Yu Decoction. Generally, during a fever, true qi is damaged; one must avoid using bitter cold herbs, fearing further injury to the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>When having a crooked mouth and slanted eyes: If there are twitching of limbs, or itching pain in the brow area, it belongs to the liver channel with blood deficiency and wind heat; use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish liver blood and enrich kidney water.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>If there are alternating chills and fever, or if there is deafness and pain in the flanks, this is attributed to excessive liver fire. First, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang combined with Si Wu Tang to clear liver fire and generate liver blood. If there are muscle cramps and bone pain, or if one is unable to move, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to nourish the source of transformation. If this is caused by taking drying herbs, use Si Wu Tang with raw licorice and honeysuckle to counteract heat toxins and benefit yin blood. All of these conditions are caused by dryness of the liver channel&#39;s blood and must primarily use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If the condition worsens due to anger or excessive labor, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Shi Quan Da Bu Tang as the main treatment. If the condition worsens due to physical strain, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Shi Quan Da Bu Tang as the main treatment.</p>
<p>During the summer and autumn with damp heat: if there is a lack of appetite, dizziness, overall weakness, or numbness in both legs, along with thirst and spontaneous sweating, shortness of breath and body heat, yellow and frequent urination, and loose stools, this indicates damp heat harming the source qi, and Clear Dryness Decoction should be used. In summer, use Clear Summer Heat and Benefit Qi Decoction. If there is spontaneous sweating or night sweats, high fever with wheezing, and body heat causing irritation, with a strong pulse, this indicates internal injury to the source qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If there is vomiting with a poor appetite, abdominal bloating, and loose stools, indicating spleen and stomach damage, use Liu Jun Zi Tang.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If there is discomfort in the chest and abdomen, along with little appetite and persistent phlegm, it indicates a deficiency in the spleen and stomach. Use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is general fatigue, numbness in the limbs, little appetite, and the heat injures the original qi, use the Ginseng Qi-Boosting Decoction. </p>
<p>For a case of thirst with turbidity: if there is peaceful sleep at night but heat during the day, it indicates heat in the qi aspect. Use the Clear Heart Lotus Seed Drink. If there is peacefulness during the day but heat at night, it indicates heat in the blood aspect; use the Four Substances Decoction with Two Herbs. This should be accompanied by the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill. If there are alternating chills and fevers, this suggests a deficiency of blood in the liver meridian; use the Modified Free and Easy Wanderer Powder with the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill.</p>
<p>For urinary difficulties: if caused by taking drying medicines, use the Four Substances Decoction with toasted black Phellodendron, Anemarrhena, and sweet Licorice to nourish yin blood. If there is frequent urination with yellow color, use the Four Substances Decoction with Ginseng, Atractylodes, Ophiopogon, and Schisandra to generate qi and blood. If the urination is scant with yellow color, use the Middle-Affecting Qi-Boosting Decoction with Dioscorea, Ophiopogon, and Schisandra to nourish the digestive source. The scriptures say: without yin, yang cannot be generated; without yang, yin cannot transform.</p>
<p>For constipation: if blood deficiency leads to internal heat causing stagnation, use the Four Substances Decoction with Ophiopogon and Schisandra to generate blood and moisten dryness.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If a patient suffers from dryness and heat due to medication, use Siwu Decoction combined with Lianqiao and Shenggancao to nourish blood and clear heat. If the condition arises from harsh medicinal treatments, use Siwu Decoction with Chuanxiong and Danggui to assist in generating Qi and blood. If there is thirst and a craving for cold drinks, indicating internal heat, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction to clear stomach fire. If there is thirst and a desire for soup, indicating weak stomach heat, use Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction to nourish Qi and generate fluids. If there is internal heat causing thirst, flushed face, and a preference for soup, use Siwu Decoction with Runchen Pills to cool the blood and moisten dryness. If there is fullness and distension in the abdomen, with dryness in the rectum leading to obstruction, use pig bile to guide it out. If there is insufficient Qi and blood in the stomach and intestines leading to obstruction, use Shiquan Dabu Decoction. If there is excessive liver and gallbladder heat causing spleen dysfunction, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction with Zhiqiao, (Muyu) Liren, and Zhike to treat it. </p>
<p>For restlessness and insomnia, or with symptoms of bleeding from the nose or blood in the stool: if there is internal heat and afternoon fever, with thirst for soup and bodily fatigue, this indicates spleen blood deficiency stirring heat; use Si Junzi Decoction with Chuanxiong and Danggui. If overthinking has injured the spleen and stirred up heat, use Gui Pi Decoction with Sanjizhi. If there is fever in the afternoon, use Bachen Decoction with Suanzaoren, Fushen, and Yuanzi. If due to heart blood deficiency, use Bai Zi Ren San.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Generally, these symptoms are caused by a deficiency in the heart, spleen, and blood. However, by nourishing the stomach qi, phlegm clears and the spirit settles, so there is no need to focus solely on clearing heat and treating phlegm. </p>
<p>When there is a fever accompanied by aversion to cold: if the limbs are weak, there is irritability and thirst, the breath is high and wheezing occurs, with headaches and spontaneous sweating, this indicates internal injury to qi and blood, and one should use the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi T decoction&quot; with the addition of five-flavor herb and wheat husk. If there is fatigue, little appetite, inconsistent bowel movements, frequent urination, and aversion to cold, this indicates deficiency of the spleen and lungs, and one should use the &quot;Sheng Yang Yi Wei T decoction.&quot; If there is irritability, thirst, fatigue, and little appetite, or food does not digest well, this suggests spleen qi deficiency with heat, and one should use the &quot;Liu Jun Zi T decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>Regarding fever: if in the morning the pulse is rapid and strong, this indicates heat in the qi level, and one should use &quot;Qing Xin Lian Zi Yin&quot;; if the pulse is rapid but weak, this indicates yang qi deficiency, and one should use &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi T decoction.&quot; In the afternoon, if the pulse is rapid and strong, this indicates heat in the blood, and one should use &quot;Si Wu T decoction&quot; with the addition of peony root; if the pulse is rapid but weak, this indicates yin and blood deficiency, and one should use &quot;Si Wu T decoction&quot; with ginseng and atractylodes.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Heat arising from the sides indicates liver deficiency; use Si Wu Decoction with ginseng, atractylodes, and astragalus. Heat arising from below the navel indicates kidney deficiency; use Si Wu Decoction with ginseng, atractylodes, rhizoma coptidis, anemarrhena, schisandra, wheat, and cinnamon, or use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the heat manifests during the day and retreats at night, or vice versa, or appears erratically, or starts from the feet, this is rootless empty fire, which requires the modified Ba Wei Wan and Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding wheat and schisandra, and additionally applying aconite powder mixed with saliva to the Yongquan point. If the body feels cold and prefers warm food and drink, this indicates a deficiency of yang qi; urgently use Ba Wei Wan. </p>
<p>If there is a dry mouth: If there&#39;s a dislike for cold food and drink, this indicates stomach qi deficiency and the inability to generate fluids; use Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. If there is a preference for cold drinks, this suggests excess stomach fire consuming fluids; use bamboo leaf and gypsum decoction. If there is fever and thirst at night, this indicates weak kidney water unable to nourish upward; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If this occurs after sweating or purging, and there is a prior condition, it indicates stomach qi deficiency, appropriate to use Ba Zhen Tang for treatment.</p>
<p>If thirsty: If there is restlessness and a desire for cold drinks, this pertains to excess heat in the upper jiao; use Liang Ge San. If there is also constipation, this reflects excess heat in the lower jiao; use Qing Liang Yin. If thirst occurs after taking purging medicine, this indicates qi and blood deficiency; urgently use Ba Zhen Tang and Liu Wei Wan.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>If one experiences deafness and tinnitus: if the pulse at the left cun (inch) is thin and rapid, it indicates deficiency heat in the heart and liver meridians. Use the Si Wu Decoction with added gardenia, Bupleurum, and herbs to nourish Yin and blood. If the pulse at the right cun is floating and large, it indicates deficient heat in the spleen and lung meridians. Use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added gardenia and Platycodon to strengthen Yang Qi. If it occurs due to anger, use the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added gardenia, Rhizoma Ligustici, and Rehmannia to clear the liver and cool the blood. If it is worse before noon, use the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with ginseng, astragalus, Rehmannia, and Atractylodes to boost Qi and clear the liver; if it is worse after noon, use the Si Wu Decoction with wine-fried Phellodendron, Anemarrhena, and Schisandra to nourish Yin and reduce heat. </p>
<p>If both feet feel hot, it relates to kidney deficiency, use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to strengthen the water principle; if both feet feel cold, it relates to Yang deficiency, use the Ba Wei Wan to nourish the source of fire. </p>
<p>If there is stiffness in the neck and difficulty in opening the mouth, and the lower back arches backward, it indicates a deficiency of Qi and blood leading to spasms. As Zhang Jingyue stated, excessive sweating in Yangming disease leads to spasms; if treated for wind disease it leads to spasms, and if one sweats again, it increases rigidity; skin ulcers also lead to spasms. Indeed, wind can disperse Qi, leading to softness without sweating and aversion to cold, termed &quot;soft spasms&quot;; cold can obstruct blood, leading to no sweating and aversion to cold, termed &quot;stiff spasms.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>This is all due to internal deficiency leading to perspiration, loss of fluids and blood, and the tendons lacking nourishment, which are all symptoms of deficiency and not due to wind disorders; thus, the primary treatment should focus on greatly tonifying qi and blood. Therefore, postpartum women with ulcers, or those who suffer from labor injuries to qi and blood, and damp-heat with rising fire, often mistakenly take counteracting medicines and suffer as a result, as the reasons can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>For women with amenorrhea: if it is due to repressed fire injuring the spleen, use Gui Pi Decoction with added gardenia and moutan bark; if due to the intake of drying medicines injuring the blood, use Si Wu Decoction with added raw licorice; if the menstruation is overdue, it is due to deficiency of qi and blood, and use Ba Zhen Decoction with increased ginseng and atractylodes. If it comes early, it is due to blood deficiency heat, and use Si Wu Decoction with increased ginseng, atractylodes, and moutan bark. If there is pain before the onset, it is due to qi deficiency and blood stasis; use Si Wu Decoction with added poria, atractylodes, and cyperus. If the color is purple and forms lumps, it indicates blood heat; use Si Wu Decoction with added gardenia and moutan bark. If there is pain and the color is pale, it indicates deficiency of blood and qi; use Ba Zhen Decoction. For excessive menstrual bleeding due to the liver fire not being able to store blood, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If the spleen is deficient and cannot manage blood, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. All of these conditions arise from the six excesses and seven emotions that deplete the original qi, so one should carefully examine the causes and tonify the stomach qi appropriately.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods for Transformations</strong></p>
<p>If there are lumps on the body, oozing pus: if there are alternating chills and fever, it indicates deficiency of liver energy and blood with heat; use Ba Zhen San plus Dan Pi and Chai Hu. If there is internal heat with chills and fever, it indicates weak blood and energy with false heat; use Ba Zhen San with increased Ren Shen and Bai Zhu. If there is a dislike of cold and a cold appearance, it indicates deficiency cold of yang energy; use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If the skin is as if covered in silk upon scratching, it indicates that energy and blood cannot nourish the exterior; use Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang. If there is itching and numbness on the face, it indicates that energy and blood cannot nourish the upper parts; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If there is weakness and cramping of the muscles, it indicates that energy and blood cannot nourish properly; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, supplemented with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan.</p>
<p>If there are ulcers on the tongue or pain in the throat: if there is a preference for cold foods and constipation, it indicates excessive heat; use Si Shun Qing Liang Yin. If there is feeling of heat on the skin, a dislike of heat, and thirst leading to drinking, it indicates blood deficiency; use Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang. If there is a dislike of cold food and stools are not solid, it indicates false heat; use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If heat arises from below or begins at the feet, it indicates kidney deficiency heat; use Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan. If food is hard to digest and the limbs are unresponsive to cold, it indicates diminished fire in the mingmen; use Ba Wei Di Huang Wan.</p>
<p>If there is tooth pain or ulceration of the gums: if there is a preference for cold and a dislike of heat, it indicates stomach fire; use Jia Wei Qing Wei San as the main treatment.

<p>For expectoration or coughing: if the right inch pulse is floating and slow, it indicates lung qi deficiency; use the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added Jie Geng. If the right inch pulse is strong and slippery, it indicates heat in the lung meridian; use the Xie Bai San. If the right inch guan pulse is floating, weak, and slow, it indicates both spleen and lung qi deficiency; use the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added Jie Geng and Huang Qi. If the right inch guan pulse is strong, slippery, and slow, it indicates spleen heat transferring to the lungs; use both Xie Bai and Xie Huang powders. If the right chi pulse is weak, it indicates declining Ming Men fire and spleen-lung deficiency; use Ren Shen Li Zhong Wan, and if ineffective, use Ba Wei Di Huang Wan.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>If the right inch pulse is strong and rapid, it indicates heart fire overcoming lung metal. Use ginseng to soothe the lungs; if ineffective, use the Six-Flavor Rejuvenation Pill. If the right inch and guan pulses are strong, wiry, and rapid, it suggests heat in both the heart and liver channels. Use Chai Hu to clear liver heat; if ineffective, add Niuhuang Qingxin Pill to clear wind-heat, while still using the Six-Flavor Rejuvenation Pill to stabilize the yang. If the left chi pulse is rapid but weak, it indicates kidney deficiency with water rising. Use the Six-Flavor Rejuvenation Pill and add five-flavored fruit to nourish yin. If the pulse is faint or the hands and feet are cold, or if there is also shortness of breath, urgently use the Eight-Flavor Rejuvenation Pill to supplement yang. </p>
<p>If the tongue is red and cracked, or if there are prickly sensations along with thirst requiring fluids, or if there is frequent urination with intermittent fever, or if heat is present without a specific location, or if there is heat rising in the soles of the feet, it indicates that kidney water is depleted and heart fire is rampant. Use the modified Eight-Flavor Pill and also take the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction.

This indicates a deficiency of the Three Yin of the feet. The primary treatment should be the modified Eight Flavor Pill, supplemented with the Complete Tonifying Decoction. </p>
<p>If one mistakenly uses cold and cooling medicines to treat the heat, it can further injure the spleen and stomach, leading to a feeling of emptiness and oppression in the chest and abdomen, diminished appetite, loose stools, difficulty in urination, abdominal distension, swelling in the limbs, or coldness in the hands and feet. This is a manifestation of virtual cold due to the deficiency of the Three Yin of the feet. In such cases, urgently administer the modified Jin Gui Shen Qi Pill, and there are also cases of recovery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Abdominal distension: If it is wide in the morning and urgent in the evening, it is due to yin deficiency; if wide in the evening and urgent in the morning, it is due to yang deficiency; if both morning and evening are urgent, both yin and yang are deficient. For yang deficiency, take Six Gentlemen Decoction in the morning and Modified Kidney Qi Pill in the evening. For yin deficiency, take Four Substances Decoction with ginseng and atractylodes in the morning and Modified Kidney Qi Pill in the evening. For true yang deficiency, take Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pill in the morning and Restore the Middle and Boost the Qi Decoction in the evening. If there is abdominal fullness, limb swelling, cold hands and feet, difficulty digesting food, possible diarrhea, and cold air inhaled through the mouth, this indicates true yang decline, with spleen, lung, and kidney cold deficiency unable to regulate water, leading to overflow. Use Modified Kidney Qi Pill urgently; otherwise, it will be too late.</p>

<p>For symptoms of blurred vision or inner obstruction with dark spots, reflecting blood deficiency and mental strain, one should use the Nourishing Yin and Kidney Qi Pill. If there is a lack of strength in seeing objects, or perceiving unusual appearances, this corresponds to weakened yin essence and requires the Nourishing Yin and Rehmannia Pill. If vision is weak or all objects appear large, it indicates excessive yang and deficient yin, necessitating the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. If there is tightness in the eyes and fatigue in the body, or numbness in the skin, this indicates deficiency of spleen and lung qi, and one should use the Effective Astragalus Decoction. If at night vision becomes dark and remains dim under lamps, it signifies sinking of yang and should be treated with the Cassia Seed Night Brightening Powder.

If there is no response, or the condition improves then recurs, promptly use the Eight Flavor Pills to tonify the gate of life fire to nourish the spleen, which will cause the diarrhea to stop.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>When there is constipation, it is attributed to deficiency in the spleen and lungs, where the fluids in the large intestine are dry, or due to blood deficiency and excessive heat. One should not count the days of discomfort. If there is an abundance of food intake, it will lead to a feeling of fullness and distension in the abdomen, creating a desire to relieve oneself but inability to do so, indicating heat in the rectum. In such cases, pig bile should be used to moisten it. </p>
<p>If one recklessly takes bitter and cold laxatives, the original energy will be further damaged, possibly resulting in continual passage without relief, leading to symptoms of abdominal impedance. For those with deficiency of qi and blood, use Ba Zhen Tang (Eight Treasure Decoction) with the addition of hemp seed kernel. For those with weak intestines and stomach, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Beneficial Qi) with added hemp seed kernel. If the kidney fluids cannot nourish, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill) with added hemp seed kernel. If there is food stagnation and difficulty in urination, indicating deficiency in the liver and kidneys, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water, along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to tonify the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If there is fever and heat in the afternoon, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added ingredients from the Free and Easy Wanderer Powder to nourish yin and blood, clearing wind-heat; if there are also muscle and bone pains, first use the Pore-Penetrating Decoction to relieve spasms, and then the Qin Jiao and Di Huang Pills, followed by the Eight Treasures Powder with added Peony Root and Bupleurum. If there has been a mistaken consumption of wind remedies that damage yin and blood, use the Easy Aging Wind-Dispelling Pills. For afflictions in the inner thighs, scrotum, or legs, the Four Life Powder and Di Huang Pills should be used effectively. If there has been a mistaken consumption of herbs like Herba Aconiti or if there has been external application of substances like Croton and Arsenic that cause muscle necrosis leading to severe sickness, the practitioner must examine it carefully. </p>
<p>For red, itchy skin, or loss of eyebrows, associated with lung wind-heat, use Ginseng Wind-Dispersing Powder and Birch Bark Powder. For qi deficiency, use the Central Qi Supplementing Decoction with added Tianma and Silkworm. For blood deficiency, use the enhanced version of the Free and Easy Wanderer Powder with added Uncaria. For facial purpura, whether in spots or patches, or loss of eyebrows, which is associated with liver wind-heat, first use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Gardenia, Red Peony, and Uncaria, then follow with the enhanced Free and Easy Wanderer Powder.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>In general, the evidence shows that dryness of the blood in the liver channel leads to wind, but it is advisable to nourish the kidney water and generate liver blood, so that the fire will naturally subside, the wind will settle, and the itching will cease. For body rashes or itchiness, this is due to wind-heat injuring the blood, and one should use Qianghuo Danggui Powder. For those with qi deficiency, it should be supplemented with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Huangzhi and Diaoteng. For those with blood deficiency, it should be supplemented with Jia Wei Xiaoyao Powder with added Diaoteng. If there are cracks in the hands and feet, regardless of their color, or if the skin on the hands, feet, or wrists is scratched and turns white, this indicates wind-heat and hidden dampness; use Qingwei Powder with added Peony. The kidneys open to the two Yin, and if the essence and blood are insufficient, it will lead to constipation. One must use Liuwei Dihuang Pill and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the source of digestion. For difficult urination: if there is no thirst and urination is difficult, heat is in the lower jiao blood level, and one should use Zishen Pill.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>When there is thirst but no urination, it is due to heat in the upper jiao. Use Qing Fei San. If the kidney meridian is yin deficient and there is no urination, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If there is heat obstructing the bladder and no urination, use Wu Lin San. If the vital energy is deficient and cannot transform, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If the spleen and lung qi are dry and cannot generate, use Huang Qin Qing Fei Yin. If there are cramps causing breathlessness, regardless of gender or pregnancy, urgently use Ba Wei Wan; delay in treatment may be fatal.</p>
<p>For turbid urine, the three yin meridians are in charge. If it is caused by rich and damp heat, use Jia Wei Qing Wei San. For liver and kidney yin deficiency with heat, primarily use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, supplemented by Xiao Yao San. For spleen and kidney yin deficiency with heat, use Liu Wei Wan, supplemented by Liu Jun Zi Tang. For liver and spleen stagnation, use Liu Wei Wan supplemented by Gui Pi Tang. For spleen and lung qi deficiency, use Liu Wei Wan supplemented by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. For damp phlegm descending, use Yi Qi Tang supplemented by Liu Wei Wan.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p>
<h3>Classification of Symptoms and Treatment</h3>
<p>The classification of symptoms refers to conditions that resemble each other in appearance but have different underlying causes. </p>
<p>For instance, if there are pustules resembling ringworm, and if intense scratching leads to oozing or lifting of white skin, this is termed kidney wind. The treatment is to use Si Sheng San to dispel wind evil, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If there&#39;s cloudiness in the head and eyes, internal heat, dry mouth, body fatigue, and phlegm heat, especially in autumn, it is commonly referred to as &quot;geese coming wind.&quot; The recommended treatment is Qiang Huo Bai Zhi San or Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. For those with qi deficiency, it should be supplemented with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang plus Zao Jiao Ci and Diao Teng Gou. For those with blood deficiency, add Chai Hu and Mu Dan Pi to Ba Wu Tang, or combine with Jia Wei Xiao Yao San for treatment.</p>
<p>If there is a condition affecting one limb or the space between the leg, arm, and wrist that is wandering and unstable, it is called &quot;red wandering wind&quot; if red, and &quot;white wandering wind&quot; if white. This condition is caused by the internal movement of blood deficiency and yin fire, being attacked by external evil.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>For white and pale conditions, use Ginseng Xiaofeng San; for red conditions, use the modified Xiaoyao San. When both Qi and blood are deficient, use Eight Treasure Decoction; for heat and internal heat in the evening, use the modified Xiaoyao San or Liuwei Dihuang Wan. </p>
<p>If there are bumps on the body or face, resembling rashes or oozing pus, with accompanying itching, pain, or temperature changes, this indicates liver fire and blood deficiency, for which the modified Xiaoyao San should be used. If there is a bitter mouth, side pain, and painful urination, it indicates liver fire and blood heat, for which Chaihu Qinggan San should be used. </p>
<p>If a woman experiences fever and vexation at night, with heat entering the blood chamber, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction with Gardenia and Rehmannia. For blood deficiency, use the combined formula of Siwu Decoction and Xiao Chaihu Decoction. When the illness recedes, use Xiaoyao San to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and to nourish yin and blood. This condition is often triggered by anger, so treatment must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>For women with itchy skin rashes that have become sores oozing pus, experiencing thirst, dizziness, and worsening in the evening, use Siwu Decoction with Chaihu, Gardenia, and Moutan to clear liver fire and nourish liver blood. If there is restlessness, fatigue, and unclear head, use Eight Treasure Decoction with Moutan and Gardenia to tonify spleen qi and nourish yin blood. If there is spontaneous sweating, night sweats, menstrual irregularities, and abdominal pain, use Eight Treasure Decoction or Liuwei Dihuang Wan.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>If appetite is low and the body is weak, with a languid heart and sweating, and if there are menstrual irregularities with cold and heat, use Ba Zhen Tang combined with Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If the illness persists and the vital energy is weak, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang combined with Gui Pi Tang. </p>
<p>For a girl aged thirteen or fourteen, or sixteen or seventeen, when the menstruation has not arrived, or for a woman with irregular menstruation accompanied by red spots, itching, and pain, this pertains to liver fire and blood heat. Use Xiao Chai Hu Tang supplemented with Shan Zhi Zi, Sheng Di Huang, Mu Dan Pi, and Fang Feng.</p>
<p>For those infested with parasites, it involves the fire of the heart suppressing gold, unable to harmonize wood and transform it. It is not caused by wind evils, but rather nourishes kidney water and generates liver blood, or can be assisted with moxibustion on Cheng Jiang.</p>
<p>If arsenic is applied and it causes pain or ulceration, frequently apply moist clay to the affected area. If the poison enters the abdomen causing chest discomfort and possible vomiting or diarrhea, drinking one or two cups of cold rice vinegar will suffice, and more is not harmful. The powder of fresh mung beans and sesame oil can also be used.</p>
<p>If applied with realgar and leads to discomfort or vomiting/diarrhea, use Fang Ji decoction to resolve it.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>If one takes a hot and spicy medicine and experiences hair loss, it indicates an injury to the liver channel&#39;s blood and the movement of fire, not wind. Use Siwu Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pill to nourish liver blood and generate kidney water. If one takes Chuanwu or Caowu and experiences agitation and drooling, or symptoms like dizziness, vomiting, or coughing up blood, use soybeans, yuan zhi, fang feng, or licorice, with any of these used in decoction for relief. Generally, excessive use of wind medications should be treated this way. If symptoms persist, urgently use licorice or ginger juice. If a poultice of Ba Dou is applied and causes pain at the affected area with muscle necrosis, grind fresh Huanglian into powder and mix with water for application. If the poison has entered the body and there are symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, take one to two qian dissolved in water. Both big and small beans, as well as Acorus, can be used. If a poultice of Li Lu is applied and poison enters the body, use onion decoction for relief. If one takes a medicine to expel wind and experiences vomiting, loss of appetite, or symptoms of chest distress and fatigue, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction to replenish yang energy. If there is agitation, thirst, loss of appetite, or evening heat and facial redness, use Siwu Decoction with added ginseng and Atractylodes to generate yin blood. Other treatments should be approached as necessary.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Black and White Leprosy</strong></p>
<p>Leprosy is caused by bad winds or by touching forbidden things that lead to harm. At first, one may notice the skin turning black, and there can be a persistent itching sensation as if insects are crawling. Sometimes the sight becomes blurry as if experiencing a veil, speech becomes uncertain, and one often feels anxious. Internally, the skin may feel like it has red and black spots resembling peach or plum rashes, accompanied by numbness in the hands and feet, where pinpricks do not cause pain. The soles of the feet may hurt so much that one struggles to stand. During meals, when opening the mouth to breathe, there may be strange sounds, and speech can be similar. The body might develop sores and itchiness that feel like crawling insects, or the elbows may feel constricted. This condition is called Black Leprosy, also known as Black Spot.</p>
<p>For those suffering from White Leprosy, their voice is hoarse, vision is unclear, limbs are sore and painful, the body is very hot, and there is an inner feeling of irritation. The hands and feet move slowly, and there is tension in the back. It may feel like being pricked by needles inside, and sometimes rashes may develop. Often, the white spots are located within the skin, there can be polyps in the nose, or white pearls may appear in the eyes, obstructing vision. This condition is referred to as White Leprosy.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The following text discusses various skin conditions related to wind and dampness in Traditional Chinese Medicine:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>(Nèihǔ) and (Nèiyuán)</strong>: When the body&#39;s Yang energy is weak externally, excessive sweating occurs, especially when exposed to wind. This wind interacts with the muscles and, combined with heat, produces (Nèihǔ)(Nèiyuán), resembling small beans. In severe cases, these can grow larger and scratching them can lead to sores.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Purple Spot Disease</strong>: This condition is characterized by the emergence of purple spots on the skin. Scratching causes the skin to rise without itch or pain. It is believed to result from wind and damp evil qi affecting the pores, clashing with the body&#39;s qi and blood, disrupting the balance of protective and nourishing forces, and causing the skin to take on a purple hue due to cold wind trapped between the muscles.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>White Spot Disease</strong>: This arises when there is obstruction of heat in the lungs, and wind externally injures the muscles. The interaction between heat and wind leads to the accumulation of harmful toxins in the pores, which struggles against the protective qi and cannot disperse. This creates raised, white patches on the skin, resulting in what is called white spot disease.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>White Fleck</strong>: According to &quot;Bingyuan Lun&quot;, white flecks appear on the face, neck, and skin, differing in color from normal flesh and are not itchy or painful, hence referred to as white fleck. This condition stems from wind evil affecting the skin and a disharmony in blood energies. White fleck results from wind in the lungs invading the skin, and if it persists without treatment, it can lead to long-lasting conditions. These tend to appear around the neck and face as small white spots without sores and lacking itch, making early treatment difficult, even when immersed in the condition.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Wind Pestilence</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wind pathogen accumulates heat and dwells in the lungs. If it remains for a long time without dispersing, it overflows into the skin, causing spots and patches to naturally connect around the neck, chest, and armpits. These spots are slightly white and round, with some appearing purplish; they are neither painful nor itchy, referred to as wind pestilence. All of this is due to wind heat remaining lodged between the skin layers, causing disharmony in qi and blood, thus giving rise to this illness.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Pestilential Wind</strong></p>
<p>In treating pestilential wind, the primary focus is on cleansing the defensive and nutritive qi. Sweating should be encouraged frequently, and bloodletting should be done often, as these are quick methods to clear the defensive and nutritive qi. The presence of parasites is due to heat in the lungs, which prevents the qi from effectively dispersing. Thus, it gradually affects the skin and muscle layers, and there are parasites in the intestines and stomach. By cleansing the metal (lungs), the parasites will self-extinguish. When wind gold stirs, drought demons disappear, illustrating this principle clearly. However, to clear the lungs, one must first cleanse the defensive and nutritive qi, as their corruption prevents proper function and impairs the lung&#39;s purifying command. Bitter medicinals can purge the liver and kill parasites, but they can also harm the stomach and should not be taken for long periods. The stomach is the source of the emergence of defensive and nutritive qi. Prolonged use of bitter cold treatments causes the nutritive and defensive qi to weaken, leading to corruption and stagnation, which is difficult to express completely. Therefore, formulas like Ku Shen Wan should not be taken by those with weak defensive and nutritive qi who do not consume enough food. Semen Euphorbiae is particularly effective for killing parasites and expelling wind, yet it is overly hot and pungent, often causing damage to the eyes before the wind is expelled.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>If one consumes sulfuric wine, it will surely lead to the calamity of split brains. Moreover, taking drunken immortal powder mixed with light powder thrice daily will leave the person in a daze as if drunk, with toxic saliva oozing between the teeth, and while the plague may not be cured, the teeth will fall out first. Indeed, for the medicine to eliminate the plague, taking it infrequently and in small amounts will ensure it is ineffective; yet taking it for a long time and in large amounts may eliminate the plague, but the harm from the medicine will be even greater. Only the Easy Aging Wind-Dispelling Pill and Dongpo&#39;s Four Divine Pills can be taken for a long time to achieve results and be considered the proper method.</p>
<p>It is essential to know that when the pulse wind manifests, it becomes a plague. However, the essential blood of a person flows through the twelve channels. Using balanced and good medicines, focusing on generating blood and clearing heat as the main approach, and using wind-dispelling and insect-killing as supplements, along with practices that induce sweat and needling, will heal all. Furthermore, it is necessary that those who are extremely intent on punishing their own wounds cannot be treated, implying abstention from sensual desires and controlling hunger; only strong men can do this. Qibo&#39;s &quot;On Evil Diseases&quot; states: &quot;The swift wind has four hundred and four types, but in summary, it does not exceed five types; these are the five winds that govern all.&quot;<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>What are the five winds? The first is the Yellow Wind, the second the Green Wind, the third the White Wind, the fourth the Red Wind, and the fifth the Black Wind. These winds correspond to the five viscera, hence they are called the Five Winds. The Five Winds produce the Five Worms: the Yellow Wind produces the Yellow Worm, the Green Wind produces the Green Worm, the White Wind produces the White Worm, the Red Wind produces the Red Worm, and the Black Wind produces the Black Worm. These five types of worms feast upon the five viscera of humans. If they consume the spleen, the speech becomes confused; if they consume the liver, the eyebrows and lashes fall; if they consume the heart, sores appear all over the body; if they consume the lungs, the nasal bridge collapses, and polyps grow within the nose; if they consume the kidneys, there is ringing in the ears, either like the sound of a car or thunder; if they consume the skin, it becomes hard and stiff; if they consume the tendons, the limbs become weak and fall apart. The Five Winds correspond to the Five Viscera, and the worms infiltrate the bones and marrow the most, coming and going without obstruction, damaging the human body, and are called the Swift Wind. The Swift Wind is the root of plague. When illness first arises, it may feel like being pricked by needles, known as the Stabbing Wind; or it may feel like crawling insects, known as the Creeping Wind; or it may cause painful contractions throughout the body, known as the Twitching Wind; or it may cause unnoticed pain and itching, known as the Stubborn Wind.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>When flesh rises like the small pits of peaches and jujubes, if it arises from the head, it is called &quot;favorable wind&quot;; if it arises from the feet, it is called &quot;adverse wind.&quot; If there are patches resembling scattered coins, mottled red, white, blue, and black, it is called &quot;pestilential wind.&quot; Some may have sores all over the body, or resemble scabies, or fish scales, or elm pods, or coin holes, experiencing either pain or itchiness, with yellow fluid flowing out, and limbs rotting, all full of pus and blood. Some may be neither itchy nor painful, may arise or disappear, in shades of blue, yellow, red, white, or black, changing unpredictably. The cause of this illness is due to the interplay of hot and cold affecting the five organs, penetrating to the marrow, resulting from excessive exertion, conflicting diet, unregulated sexual activity, or excessive labor causing sweating all over the body. Consequently, accumulated heat penetrates the five organs, with impure diet leading to an abundance of worms that consume the five organs, marrow, skin, flesh, and tendons, resulting in decay over time, called &quot;pestilential wind.&quot; Therefore, it is said: if one wishes to treat this, one should first take a pill made from ferula (asafoetida) to expel the worms, observe their shape, whether blue, yellow, red, white, or black, and then administer medication, ensuring precision. If one contracts this illness, it is advisable to quickly abandon home, family, and possessions, retreat to the mountains for quiet recuperation, and treatment, ensuring no mistakes are made.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Discussion of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Pestilential wind, also known as great wind, is also called leprosy wind and commonly referred to as great leprosy. Although this disease is named &quot;wind,&quot; it is not caused by the external influence of wind. Instead, it arises from the malevolent evils present in the yin and filthy air of heaven and earth, where it may either transform due to the influence of wind and wood, causing heat and the emergence of insects, or it may arise from damp toxins in the skin and fur, subsequently affecting the body&#39;s defensive and nutritive qi. It can also result from uncleanliness or from contagion, all of which lead to the birth of insects. In essence, these insects are governed by the Liver&#39;s yin, which is associated with wind and wood, and is responsible for the emergence of various insects. The initial occurrence of the insects is not intentional, but as time goes on, they multiply, leading to a situation that is irredeemable. This is indeed the most malign, perilous, and disgraceful manifestation. Moreover, the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text states: &quot;Those who act unkindly are engaged in the most heinous acts, making it extremely difficult to treat.&quot; Observing the words of Master Sun, he mentioned that he treated hundreds of patients, yet not a single one escaped death, for none adhered to the necessary prohibitions.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Only one woman recovered from illness; after taking a modified Si Wu Decoction for over a hundred doses, she finally regained her menstruation after more than half a year, achieving complete recovery. Among the five patients treated by Danxi, only one woman escaped death due to her extreme poverty and lack of food; the other three or four individuals relapsed and died after two or three years. From this, it can be seen that extraordinary secret prescriptions are rarely effective in such cases. Therefore, when I encounter such conditions, I do not dare to hastily claim knowledge and recklessly apply treatments, nor do I boldly assert treatment methods that may mislead future generations. As for the ancient methods discussed in treatments, they are indeed very thorough; when applied appropriately, even if the root cause of the disease may not be completely eradicated, one can still prolong their years and avoid premature death. Thus, after extensive inquiry into various opinions, Xue Lijia&#39;s &quot;Essentials of Epidemic Diseases&quot; stands out as the most comprehensive. </p>
<p>Epidemic diseases often feature accompanying or changing symptoms; all types of illnesses caused by internal or external organs have these characteristics, and their respective treatment methods have already been articulated in various schools. One should appropriately adapt treatments based on the symptoms presented, ensuring comprehensive support, as all methods can yield good outcomes. Due to the extensive information available, I shall not elaborate further on this matter. </p>
<p><strong>Prohibitions</strong></p>
<p>Those suffering from this illness often do so due to a lack of restraint in their desires. To treat this illness, one must promptly cease consuming meat, strong flavors, salty sauces, and all heavy foods, and instead cultivate a calm heart and minimal desires, avoiding distractions and immersing oneself in natural surroundings. One should also abandon worldly concerns and seek treatment early; doing so may increase the chance of survival. If one does not adhere to these prohibitions, relapses are likely, leading to severe consequences that may be beyond remedy; this is all due to the failure to observe these restrictions.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescription for the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epidemic diseases are related to the miasma of the Two Guangdong regions, transformed by heat and humidity. The qi is predominantly hot rather than cold, and the symptoms include headaches and abdominal fullness. Locals who consume areca nut are not harmed by it as it disperses the symptoms due to its pungency. The essence of fire, when cooled by cold, becomes suppressed and unable to manifest; thus, the pungent nature of areca nut readily enters the body and its flavor effectively disperses, making it appropriate for the illness. However, it can only alleviate urgent situations temporarily and should not be relied upon as a permanent solution.</p>
<p>Now, I establish a formula to continuously combat the invasion of miasma. Use one qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and areca nut; five qians of white atractylodes; three qians each of poria and ophiopogon; five fen each of tangerine peel, licorice, bitter orange peel, and bupleurum; and five grains of schisandra. Boil these in water and take them.</p>
<p>The wonders of this formula do not originate from what is typically used to treat miasma, but rather, it alleviates the condition itself. Strengthening the spleen enhances qi, which in turn prevents miasma from invading. For those already affected, the formula contains herbs that expel miasma—how could it fail to yield effective results? This method of treating miasma is important to understand. However, if someone suffers from miasma and develops severe leprosy, this treatment is not appropriate.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Leprosy is primarily caused by the accumulation of pathogenic heat and toxins, which envelop the skin, while dampness is concealed within the muscles and bones. This results in external symptoms such as redness of the skin, loss of hair, and widespread rotting, emitting a stench that makes it unbearable for anyone to approach for treatment. I feel a deep sorrow for this, so I devised a unique formula using four taels each of Yuan Shen, Cang Zhu, Shu Di, Cang Er Zi, Yi Ren, and Fu Ling, named the Six-Four Decoction. Each ingredient is ground into a powder and made into pills with honey. Taking one tael daily will surely lead to complete recovery. The brilliance of this formula lies in its ability to tonify the kidney and strengthen the spleen, while also dispersing wind and eliminating dampness. When the body is properly nourished, the pathogens naturally retreat, so there is no need to directly treat the leprosy itself—it will resolve on its own. It’s recommended to have this printed and distributed widely; the merits of this act cannot be quantified. One should only avoid sexual activity. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is another formula using one qian of betel nut, eight fen of Chai Hu, and three qian each of Bai Zhu, Bai Shao, Bai Jiao Zi, and Fu Ling, with two qian of Che Qian Zi and five fen of Zhi Ke, all boiled in water for oral consumption. If there is heat, add five fen of Huang Lian and boil again for oral consumption. Two doses will alleviate the condition as well, which is also a remarkable formula. </p>
<p>For leprosy, I have yet another extraordinary formula using two taels each of Cang Zhu, Shu Di, Yuan Shen, Cang Er Zi, Bai Jiao Zi, Che Qian Zi, and fresh Gan Cao, along with ten taels of Jin Yin Hua and four taels of Pu Gong Ying, all ground into a powder and made into pills. One dose will lead to complete recovery.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Recipe for Birch Bark Powder</strong></p>

<p>Ingredients: Kushen, Stone-Dissolving, Clear Wine.</p>
<p>Take these three ingredients and first infuse the Stone-Dissolving in Clear Wine for either twenty-seven days or thirty-seven days. Then, combine with Kushen and place into a wine jar to steep for seven days, gradually consuming it. </p>
<p>Dosage: Take on an empty stomach, three times a day. During the first seven days, consume about the size of a half egg at a time. After seven days, you may drink up to a liter, as much as you feel inclined. The more you consume, the better; the illness will diminish quickly. If you experience excessive wind movement, avoid getting drunk or vomiting; it is better to drink less gradually rather than too much all at once.</p>
<p>This remedy is effective against both red and white wind; for this medicine, it is guaranteed to heal all ailments. Other illnesses are not difficult to treat. Why? Because heat is the root cause. Thus, Kushen can treat heat, and the Stone-Dissolving eliminates heat and expels worms. For both red and white worms, merely inhaling the essence of the Stone-Dissolving will turn them into water, effectively addressing the root of heat.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>If one suffers from the dual afflictions of red and white wind, regardless of how long it has been, even after five years, adding yellow消石, alcohol, and bitter herbs (such as苦参) in quantities of three to four taels will lead to recovery. Even after thirty years, if there is no falling away of the nose, fingers, or joints, and provided there are no black worms, all can achieve lasting recovery. First, avoid sexual activity, excessive anger, and hot foods. Refrain from sticky foods, five pungent vegetables, cold dishes, strong vinegars, alcohol, and meats like pork, fish, chicken, dog, donkey, horse, and lamb; all these are major prohibitions, while other foods are not restricted. This is a treatment method, not a fundamental cure. If someone experiences stubborn numbness without feeling pain or itchiness in certain areas, they should apply a thick white plaster and massage it three to four times a day for seven days, or continue for two or three sessions of seven days each, up to a total of forty-nine days, which is termed one complete treatment. If the numbness resolves and the itchiness subsides as before, one should stop massaging. If it does not resolve, continue to massage until healed. Generally, two or three complete treatments will suffice for recovery. Techniques like acupuncture, moxibustion, or incisions are not as effective as this method of massage. Even if one has many scars, massaging them will surely lead to healing.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Great White Ointment</strong><br>1 sheng of Bai Zhi, Bai Zhu, Qian Hu, and Wu Zhu Yu; 3 liang of Shu Jiao and Xi Xin; 2 liang of Dang Gui and Gui Xin; 4 sheng of bitter wine; 2 sheng of Xiong Dan.<br>Mix these ten ingredients and soak them in bitter wine overnight.

Drill holes at the bottom of the vessel and place twenty or thirty green stones, about the size of peaches, plums, or eggs, over the bottom hole by two or three inches. Then add the bitter sophora, disintegrated stone powder, and wine all at once into the vessel. Have a boy of thirteen or fourteen mix and stir well. Immediately, cover the vessel&#39;s mouth with several layers of old paper and seal it with clay to prevent air leakage. When taking the wine, ensure that it flows out through the hole; do this once a day, or even twice if necessary. Afterward, seal the hole tightly again to prevent leaking. Do not open the vessel to take the wine. When the wine nears depletion, open the vessel to retrieve the bitter sophora residue, strain to extract the wine, and discard the residue. Keep the wine in a sealed place to avoid air leakage; the method of taking the wine remains as described earlier, and there will be no failure to heal.

<p>For the disease characterized by a collapsed nose and distorted hands and feet, with unbearable pain in the joints leading to eventual loss of limbs: use one ounce of peeled castor beans and one ounce of yellow gentian, size of large beans, soak these in one liter of water in a small bottle. Soak for two days in spring and summer, and five days in autumn and winter. Afterward, take one castor bean, break it, face east, and swallow it immersed in the medicinal water. Gradually increase to four or five beans; a slight benefit is not a problem. Add more water to the bottle as it diminishes. After two months, try eating garlic and pork; if it does not react, the remedy is effective. If an issue arises, continue taking until there is no reaction.</p>
<p>For the severe wind-leprosy: in March and April, harvest the seedlings and roots of Aconitum and do not wash off the soil.

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p><strong>The &quot;Suwen&quot; says:</strong> For serious wind diseases, if the bones and joints are heavy, and the hair falls out, it is called “great wind.” Acupuncture of the muscles leads to sweat for a hundred days. Acupuncture of the bone marrow also leads to sweat for a hundred days. Overall, for two hundred days, once the hair grows back, stop acupuncture. For pestilential wind, one should first needle the swellings, and after needling, use a sharp needle to puncture that area to press out the bad qi, stopping only when the swelling is gone. Regularly consume regular food, and avoid other foods. <strong>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure Mirror&quot; cites:</strong> The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: Wind leads to pestilence. Moreover, it says: The wind energy and the sun enter the pathways of the meridians, dispersing among the muscles, interfering with the protective qi, leading to swelling and harm in the flesh; because the protective qi becomes stagnant and doesn’t circulate, the muscles become numb. Pestilential wind involves the warming and protecting influence being not clear, leading to ruin of the nasal columns and discoloration, skin ulcers, and cold and wind residing in the meridians without dissolution, named pestilential wind, or named cold-heat disease.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>The affliction known as &quot;Great Wind&quot; causes heaviness in the joints, drooping of the eyebrows and hair, and is named &quot;Great Wind&quot; because it pierces the muscles. Thus, sweating occurs for a hundred days, and piercing the bone marrow causes sweating for a hundred days as well, totaling two hundred days until the hair and eyebrows grow back and the needling ceases. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; it is stated: the method of using acupuncture for pestilential sores, Zhang Zihe said that a single sweat is worth a thousand needles, for acupuncture draws blood less effectively than sweating does in a comprehensive manner. Nevertheless, sweating leads to blood loss, and blood loss leads to sweating; they are one and the same. If the stagnant toxic blood accumulates on the surface of the muscles and meridians, it is advisable to puncture the Weizhong point to draw out blood for efficacy. If the toxic accumulation resides in the internal organs, it cannot heal without cleansing it from within. If the poison is located externally, not only must the diseased areas be needled, but blood must be drawn from the seams of the arms, legs, hands, and feet, for the toxin cannot disperse. If both the interior and exterior are poisoned, without external needling to draw out the internal toxins, it cannot possibly retreat. </p>
<p>If the upper body is more affected, it is suitable to use &quot;Drunken Immortal Powder&quot; to expel the toxic blood from between the teeth and to pierce the seams of the fingers and along the arms to remove the superficial toxic blood. If the lower body is more affected, it is appropriate to use &quot;Restorative Powder&quot; to allow the toxic blood and lingering parasites to emerge from the digestive tract; along with this, needling the seams of the toes and wrists should be done, with a gap of one or two days between sessions, using the color of the blood as a measure. If there are symptoms of toxic heat and headaches, the primary focus should be on greatly replenishing qi and blood.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rujun Shiqin&quot; states: Zhu Ge treated his family&#39;s leprosy and sought help from Dai, who declined, saying it would be treatable in five to six months. This spring, it was still cold, and medicine could not yet be taken; I had already prepared my travel gear to Wanqiu, waiting to concoct the medicine in five to six months. Zhu Ge believed this to be an excuse. Later, Dai indeed arrived at Zhu Ge in June, prepared garlic, duckweed, and other medicines, instructing someone to summon Zhu Ge, saying: &quot;The medicine is ready, you may come for treatment.&quot; Zhu Ge, bewildered by other medicines, did not go. Dai remarked: &quot;It was not an excuse before; in early spring, sweating was not possible due to the cold, but in the hotter months, it is easier to sweat. Acupuncture is the same as inducing sweat. However, for those without medicine, acupuncture can achieve the same effect as a thousand needles. Thus, Gao Gongfeng sang the tune of gathering duckweed: &#39;Not in the mountains, not on the shores, gather me in mid-July, distinguishing between paralysis wind and weakness wind; minor breezes do not count. Drop three pills in bean wine, the iron cap will also result in sweating.&#39; Alas! Scholars belittle each other, physicians harm each other. Scholars merely incur self-damage, whereas physicians can harm others—such is the plight of Zhu Ge, isn’t it?<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>In the summer of Yangxia, the registrar Zhang had suffered from leprosy for over ten years, losing all his hair and having skin as rough as tree bark. A diagnostic healer determined that it was treatable and advised to induce a great sweat. The sweat was supposed to be foul-smelling and the saliva fishy. They placed him in a heated room, sealing all gaps against drafts, and administered the San Sheng powder to induce vomiting. Sweat poured from his body as if he were in water, and indeed, the sweat was so thick and stinky it was unbearable. The phlegm was fishy like fish excrement, and the soles of his feet were slightly sweaty. Subsequently, they administered the Zhou Che pill and Jun Chuan powder to purge him vigorously five to seven times; after several such treatments, he was cured.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>The &quot;Health Treasure Mirror&quot; states: In the year of Wu-Yin, during the first month, a man named Duanku suffered from a severe wind illness, with extreme itching all over his face and neck. His eyebrows had fallen out, and applying hot soup provided some relief. He had to apply it several times day and night; even acupuncture provided some improvement. The venerable teacher said: The pulse of wind signifies a pathogenic wind. When the Wei and Ying (defensive and nutritive qi) become heated and cloudy, it damages the nasal bridge and discolors the skin. Severe wind indicates that wind and cold settle in the meridians and do not disperse. The treatment should involve needling the swollen areas with sharp needles to expel the harmful qi, stopping only when the swelling subsides. One should regularly consume prescribed food and avoid other foods.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Cases&quot; states: A man experienced bitterness in his mouth and tinnitus during winter, accompanied by itching and dampness in the scrotum. In spring, he developed purple spots on his face, slight swelling, and numbness, which progressed to widespread purple discoloration by winter, without any pain or itching. By spring, the purple areas grew larger, and in summer, they began to ulcerate; by spring, his eyebrows had fallen out and ulcers formed on his fingers. This illness was located in the liver and gallbladder meridians, and the treatment involved needling the spaces between his fingers, as well as on his arms and legs, drawing out dark blood. Initially, he was given &quot;Zai Zao San&quot; (Rebuilding Powder) two doses to clear the toxic filth, and then combined &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang&quot; (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with &quot;Si Wu Tang&quot; (Four Substance Decoction), adding Bai Zhi, Fang Feng, Tian Ma, and Jiao Ci, which gradually improved his condition. He was also given &quot;Huan Ji San&quot; (Muscle Change Powder). However, he presented with slight redness all over, indicating a deficiency of blood with heat; due to financial difficulties, he had not received proper treatment. In autumn, he had fevers, and by spring, discoloration on his face persisted. With past formulas and blood-nourishing medicine, he gradually recovered, benefiting from the diligence of youth in managing his ailments.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>A person accustomed to rich food had a nose gone bad and eyebrows fallen out, fingers detached and body decayed, suffering from intense heat and thirst. I prescribed a decoction of Four Substances Soup with wine, sautéed with black Phellodendron, Anemarrhena, Schisandra, Wheat, Angelica, Gastrodia, and Angelica sinensis—over thirty doses, with little relief for his thirst. It was mid-summer, and he felt weary, was short of breath and had a hot body, with yellow and frequent urination and loose stools. This was a case of depleted vital energy and excessive summer heat; therefore, I used the Emmeric Ziziphus Decoction for quick relief. I then prescribed the Muscle Exchange Powder and Energy Boosting Soup, taken together for two months; additionally, he replaced tea with the Shengmai Decoction, and his sores reduced. By mid-autumn, he experienced dizziness, little appetite, sweating, body heaviness, and frequent loose stools; this too was a symptom of dampness during the season. I used the Clear-Dry Decoction to regulate and heal him; moreover, using the Emmeric Ziziphus Decoction with a little wine, sautéing black Phellodendron, Anemarrhena, Gastrodia, and Angelica sinensis, it took over two months to recover. However, due to exhaustion and ear ringing, heat thirst, he mistakenly took a wind-dispelling powder, worsening his condition with red rashes on the body, which improved with the Energy and Clarity Decoction over a month until he recovered.</p>
<p>A man experienced red pain and thirst, with purulent discharge, agitation, hot palms, dim vision, and speech slurring, feeling anxious and uneasy—these were symptoms of heart organ damage. I prescribed a Spirit Calming Pill along with Eight Treasures Soup, adding a bit of Actinidia, roasted black Coptis, and Polygala; his vital energy gradually recovered. I applied acupuncture, and the external evil gradually retreated. However, he felt dryness leading to thirst; I used the Chaihu Decoction with Eight Treasures Soup for healing, followed by the Muscle Exchange Powder until he was cured.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>A man had blue veins in his abdomen, purple blisters on his face, felt feverish and thirsty, with symptoms worsening during the hours of Yin and Yang (early morning), a wiry and rapid pulse, leg cramps, and dark-colored urine. This indicated a condition of heat in the liver meridian. Initially, he was treated with Chai Hu Decoction, which reduced the heat and improved urination; then he was given Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with Si Wu Decoction, adding Gentian and fried Gardenia for over thirty doses, followed by Ba Zhen Decoction with Chai Hu and Gardenia to nourish his qi and blood, and finally used Huan Ji San to dispel internal toxins and stabilize his condition. After a year of labor and unsuitable diet, he suffered from headaches with alternating chills and fevers, and developed widespread rashes. He used Zui Xian San but unfortunately passed away.</p>
<p>Another man presented with purple nodules on his face, oozing pus, convulsions while sleeping, widespread numbness, and gradually developed red patches. He would itch upon exertion or anger. His liver pulse was large and forceful, and he had bleeding from cupping on his arms, legs, and wrists. He was treated with Qing Wei Decoction plus rhubarb and hornet&#39;s nest for four doses to induce a purgative effect, resulting in a slight decrease in liver pulse. A few doses of Sheng Ma Decoction followed to help expel the remaining issues, with marginal improvement. He then received Baojian Huan Ji San over the course of about a pound, along with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with Si Wu Decoction adding ginseng, atractylodes, gastrodia, and hornet&#39;s nest for over one hundred doses, and he recovered after six months. Later, due to physical exertion, he experienced widespread itching, with a weak and slow pulse, indicating deficiency of both qi and blood that could not nourish the skin. He was treated with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction adding five-flavored herb and wheat, and after a year of regulation, he was stable.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>A man presented with a red and purple face, itching and pain in the lower body, heat in the afternoon, and dry black stools. This indicated excessive fire and deficient blood. Treatment included Zai Zao San and Si Wu Tang, supplemented with Fang Ji and Dan Cao, to expel toxic blood through the toes, leading to improved bowel movements. The previous medications were then supplemented with Bai Zhu, Bai Zhi, Fu Ling, Qiang Huo, and Du Huo, resulting in yellow stools. Si Wu Tang was used again without Dan Cao and Fang Ji, with reduced use of Du Huo, and added Yuan Shen and Bi Xie. After more than fifty doses, the lesions receded. Later, a formula to tonify the middle and boost Qi with Tian Ma and Mai Men was administered to gradually restore Qi and blood. During the rainy late autumn, Qing Zao Tang was employed for comfort. Subsequently, Huan Ji San, Hu Ma San, and Ba Zhen Tang were taken together for recovery.</p>
<p>A patient in an upper chamber experienced facial swelling, skin resembling eczema, which later developed into purple lumps that leaked fluid when scratched, a manifestation of spleen and lung issues. Initially, Qing Wei Tang was used to clear stomach heat and resolve exterior toxins, followed by Si Wu Tang with Shan Zhi, Huang Qin, Chai Hu, Zao Jiao Ci, and Gan Cao to nourish the blood and dispel wind-heat. The affected areas of the arms, legs, wrists, hands, and toes were treated with acupuncture to remove toxic blood and clear channels. Lastly, Ba Zhen Tang was combined with Bai Zhi, Zao Jiao Ci, Wu Jia Pi, Quan Xie, and Er Sheng San for over a month to nourish Yin blood and address sores and toxins. There was slight improvement with Bu Qi Xie Rong Tang, followed by Huan Ji San for full recovery. However, due to overexertion, red rashes reappeared, particularly exacerbated in the afternoon, for which Si Wu Tang was adjusted with Dan Pi, Chai Hu, and Shan Zhi, alongside the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for over a year, allowing him to work without worsening his condition.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>A man was covered in sores like scabs, scratching them caused them to fester, his skin was purple and numb, pressing on them caused pain, and he had infrequent and scanty urination. This indicated an illness from the spleen and stomach, with the symptoms mainly on the surface. I used the Qingwei Powder and also needled the affected areas along with the arms and legs to draw out dark blood, which gradually improved his spirit; however, he still felt cold, fatigued, and had a dry mouth. This indicated that the evil qi had departed but genuine qi was deficient. I administered large doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, ligusticum, evodia, and platycodon, restoring his essential qi rapidly. Then I used the Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus, angelica, evodia, gastrodia, softened bupleurum, and the Two Holy Powder to treat him, which led to gradual recovery of the sores. Later, he had a recurrence but mistakenly used aggressive methods to attack the toxins, resulting in him suffering from both cold and warm pathogens and ultimately leading to death.</p>
<p>Another man had bumps all over his body; scratching did not cause itching, and pressing did not cause pain. He suffered from constipation and thirst; this indicated that the evil was internal. I prescribed the Zai Zao Powder twice, which slightly purged three times. I then used the Peaches and Plums Purging Decoction with four doses of angelica and needled to resolve the pathological blood, which gradually relieved the pain and itching. However, he felt fatigued, so I used tonifying medicine to restore his essential qi. Additionally, I used the Two Holy Powder, causing the sores to heal rapidly. I further applied substantial tonics, and after a year, he recovered. Later, he suffered from an accumulation of phlegm and sputum, with a stiff tongue and slurred speech. I used the Er Chen Decoction along with four doses of atractylodes, unhusked barley, and plantain, which led to his recovery, and then used the Bao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to adjust and stabilize his condition.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>A man lived in great distress; his eyebrows had completely fallen out, and he was ill from ailments affecting the liver and gallbladder. He pricked his arms, legs, and the afflicted areas to release black blood, taking Eight Treasures Decoction with added ingredients of five flavors, sesame, and Polygonum multiflorum. After eating, he took a medicinal powder to change the flesh. He was pleased that there were no complications and was able to strictly adhere to prescribed restrictions. In less than half a year, he recovered.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar experienced itching and pain in the soles of his feet, or numbness and swelling. After two years, his body began to itch, gradually developing bumps, with heat and ringing in the ears that worsened in the afternoon; this was a sign of kidney deficiency. He treated it by pricking his arms, legs, and the spaces between his fingers to drain the stagnant blood, using a combination of Liuwei Dihuang pills with added five flavors and over fifty doses of Chaihu to tonify the kidneys. He also employed a powder to expel wind and treat sores, each weighing several jin. Gradually, the sores healed, as he received nourishment and adhered to restrictions.</p>
<p>A man in higher status was afflicted all over, his overall condition weak. I suggested he needed tonification to restore his vital energy before treating the sores. He did not believe this and instead consumed snake wine to attack internal toxins and applied arsenic and other medicines to corrode external toxins, which immediately led to vomiting of clear water and body pain like being pierced by a nail. Some thought the toxic gas was exiting his body; I pointed out that the spleen governs muscles, and this was due to the poison injuring the spleen. In contrast, taking detoxifying agents led to relentless vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in death.</p>
<p>Another man used a medicinal wash, and despite not sweating, suffered from wheezing, cough, loss of appetite, abdominal rumbling, cold extremities, and muscle spasms. This was caused by heat damaging vital energy, resulting in loose pores and loss of yang. That very day, he indeed died.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>When the wind and the sun both enter, they traverse the meridian, dispersing among the flesh and sinews, interacting with the defensive qi. If the pathways are obstructed, it causes the muscles to become swollen and result in sores; when the defensive qi stagnates and does not flow, the flesh becomes insensate. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: The pathways of the defensive qi being obstructed leads to swollen muscles and the formation of boils; when the defensive qi stagnates in the neck and back, it cannot circulate through the skin and flesh, resulting in numbness and insensitivity to pain and itchiness.]</strong></p>
<p>When a pestilence (lethargy) attaches itself to the nutrient qi, if this qi is impure, it causes the nasal bridge to decay and the complexion to deteriorate, resulting in skin ulcers and sores. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: Wind injures the nutrient qi, combining with heat, which arises from the flesh; therefore, the internal and external qi of the muscles becomes impure. When the wind evil interacts with the nutrient and defensive qi on the surface, it leads to the impurity of these energies, causing the nasal bridge to collapse, the complexion to become foul, and leading to skin ulcers and leprosy.]</strong></p>
<p>When wind and cold remain in the pulse without departing, it is called pestilent wind, or it may also be referred to as cold and heat. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: When the evil of wind and cold lingers within the pulse, causing injury to the nutrient qi, it is also called pestilent wind. Nutrient ailments then present with cold, heat, and reduced energy, hence it may also be called cold and heat.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The wind of illness manifests as a plague.<br>[Note: The plague refers to severe diseases like leprosy. Wind is an external yang heat pathogen, while blood is an internal yin dampness. Damp heat breeds parasites, thus, when wind enters the pulse, it can eventually transform into the afflictions of leprosy.]</p>

<p><strong>Severe Illness from Great Wind</strong></p>
<p>Severe illness from great wind presents in various forms. Initially, although the body shows no apparent abnormalities, the eyebrows and facial hair may have fallen out; or the body may be entirely compromised while the eyebrows and facial hair remain intact; or there may be no signs on the body while certain areas like limbs and back exhibit persistent issues, with severe cases resulting in the fingers of hands and feet falling off. Some may suffer from great cold but find that heavy clothing does not warm them; others may experience common heat illnesses that cannot find relief. There are those whose bodies appear emaciated; some sweat profusely without cessation; others experience dry, itching skin that feels gritty, with scratches revealing white patches like flour, while others develop sores. Some have painful injuries that overlap and cause suffering continuously day and night; there are also those who are numb and unaware of pain or itching. The colors of these ailments vary as well: there are shades of blue, yellow, red, white, and black; some may be bright and withered, others dark and dull.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the types and appearances of these conditions vary, whether difficult or easy to treat, all is in the hands of those before us, not the healers. Why is this? Once afflicted, regardless of whether one is wise or foolish, communication becomes difficult. Why? The mouth may follow, but the heart diverges; one does not accept the teachings of medicine but merely hopes for the power of medicine, failing to seek within oneself. Thus, whether the condition is difficult or easy to treat relies on those before us, not on medicine. I have personally treated over six hundred people, and among those healed, only one in ten succeeded, for I cared for each one personally, leading to my deep understanding. I find it difficult to communicate, and if one does not accept the treatment, there is no need for healing, for there will inevitably be setbacks. If the illness does not heal, then the effort is in vain. Additionally, the &quot;Records of Immortals&quot; mention several dozen individuals who, due to severe illnesses, attained the path to immortality. Why is this? All of them cast aside worldly burdens and embraced the winds of Yang. Therefore, it is not merely about healing the body but also about transforming misfortune into fortune.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>故余所睹病者，其中颇有土大夫，乃至有异种名人，及遇斯患，皆爱恋妻孥，系着心髓，不能割舍，直望药力，未肯近求诸身。若能绝其嗜欲，断其所好，非但愈疾，因兹亦可自致神仙。余尝问诸病人，皆云：自作不仁之行，久久并为极猥之业，于中仍欲更作云。为虽有悔言而无悔心。但能自新，受师教命，餐进药饵，何有不除？余以贞观年中，将一病士入山，教服松脂，欲至百日，须眉皆生。由此观之，惟须求之于己，不可一仰医药者也。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, among the illnesses I have seen, there are many notable figures, including local lords and even distinguished individuals of different backgrounds, who when faced with such afflictions, are deeply attached to their wives and children, unable to cut their ties, continually hoping for the efficacy of drugs and unwilling to seek healing from within themselves. If they could sever their desires and abandon their attachments, not only would they recover from their illnesses, but they could also attain immortality. I have often asked patients, and they all say: &quot;Our own unkind deeds have long led us into extreme degradation, yet we still wish to continue on this path.&quot; Even though they express regret, they lack true repentance. However, if they can renew themselves, heed their teacher&#39;s instructions, and take the medicinal remedies, what is there that cannot be healed? During the Zhenguan era, I took a sick patient into the mountains and taught him to take pine resin, which he continued for a hundred days, and he regained his vitality. From this, it is evident that the pursuit of healing must come from within; one cannot solely rely on medicine.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are those who suffer from stubborn physical ailments for many years, ashamed to face their wives, not revealing the truth to them. Eventually, the illness worsens, becoming evident, and they claim it was caused by improper medication. This is all self-deception. Although this illness is serious, it can be treated at an early stage and may lead to immediate recovery. Once contracted, those far away rarely survive more than ten years, while those nearby may pass away in five or six years. Yet, those afflicted believe they will live a hundred years, which is truly tragic! Upon encountering this illness, one must immediately stop consuming salt and regularly intake pine resin; all public and private affairs should be let go, as if discarding an old shoe. Any and all flavors must be eliminated; one should avoid worldly matters and sever ties with festivities and condolences, seeking solitude in remote valleys, where recovery may take a year. After recovery, one must be cautious in sexual matters, as any transgression may lead to a recurrence. This illness has both auspicious and inauspicious implications; if one cultivates goodness upon being afflicted, it will be fortunate; conversely, if one continues to follow worldly ways, it will surely be disastrous.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Epidemic wind leads to the vitality and heat of the spirit being disturbed, causing the nose to decay in color, and the skin to develop sores and ulcers. This occurs when the wind and cold invade the pulse and do not leave, which is termed epidemic wind. It is also said that the pulse of wind transforms into an epidemic, commonly referred to as leprosy. Therefore, the treatment method states: great wind leads to heavy joints, drooping of the eyebrows, which is called great wind. Needling the muscles causes sweating for a hundred days. Wang’s commentary states: it releases the stagnant heat of the protective Qi. Needling the bone marrow induces sweating for a hundred days. It releases the stagnant heat of the nourishing Qi. Generally, after three days, white eyebrows appear and then the needling is stopped. The stagnant heat is expelled, the yin energy returns within, thus leading to more sweating and the appearance of white eyebrows. Begin with birch bark powder, starting with a small amount and gradually increasing; after five to seven days, moxibustion on the Chengjiang point seven times, moxibustion on the sores lightly and repeat if necessary, and continue until the sores heal; then take the Ersheng powder to eliminate heat and expel the wind evil from the blood. Avoid marital relations for three years.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Acupuncture and medicine stop describing forms based on symbols; this is the method for treating wind in the lungs. However, it is not limited to the lungs alone. It is commonly said that the nose belongs to the lungs, and when the disease manifests at the end of the lungs, it is often interpreted that if the nose swells, becomes red, and inflamed, it is simply a type of sore. This is because blood follows the transformation of qi; if qi does not transform, then blood accumulates. Once blood accumulates, it causes the flesh to rot and gives rise to worms. It is said that the jueyin (the liver) oversees the generation of five worms, and jueyin represents wind and wood, hence wood generates the five worms. The three jiaos (the body&#39;s functional units) are excessively hot and overpower the metal (lungs), which weakens the metal, allowing wood to invade and dominate; as the classics say: &quot;domination is superior.&quot; Therefore, it is wise to drain the heat and benefit the qi with appropriate medicine, and the worms will cease to arise. The principle states: &quot;Flowing water does not rot, and door hinges do not decay.&quot; This is what it means. Hence, the disease signifies blood heat. It should be treated with medicine to soothe and relieve; decocting the &quot;Sheng Ma Decoction&quot; and taking the &quot;Qian&#39;s Recipe for Draining Heat&quot; accordingly, as stated in the classics. Therefore, those with wind disease initially receive yang qi.</p>
<p><strong>Contagious Wind</strong></p>
<p>Contagious wind is characterized by a hot and unclear essence, leading to the deterioration of the nasal structure and discoloration, along with skin ulcers. Wind and cold invade the pulse and do not disperse, hence it is called contagious wind, or pulse wind, commonly referred to as leprosy. Treatment method: puncture the muscles for one hundred days, induce sweating for one hundred days; in total, two hundred days must pass for a beard to grow and then cease. Begin with birch bark powder, gradually increasing the amount, and take it for five to seven days. Moxibustion at the Chengjiang point with seven strong applications, if the sore heals, moxibustion again, and once healed, repeat this three times. Afterwards, take the &quot;Two Holy Powder&quot; to dispel the heat and expel the blood wind evil, refraining from bedroom activities for three years; in this way, the disease will be cured.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Disease Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The disease of great wind is caused by the lethal winds of heaven and earth; the ancients referred to it as pestilent wind due to its fierce and frightening nature. When someone contracts it, it must be categorized as affecting either the upper or lower body. For those affected in the upper body, one should use alcohol and herbal formulas to expel foul phlegm and blood from between the teeth; for those affected in the lower body, one should administer herbal remedies to eliminate harmful substances and stagnant matter from the intestinal tract. Although there are different pathways for expulsion, they all pertain to the Yangming channel. </p>
<p>To treat this disease, it is crucial to understand this principle. If the lumps and sores appear mainly in the upper body, then the condition is upper-focused; if they appear mainly in the lower body, then it is lower-focused; if both upper and lower are affected, then involvement is present in both areas. The Yangming channel encompasses the stomach and large intestine, and no substance is exempt from being processed. When this wind enters a person, if it primarily affects the qi, the upper body is more severely impacted; if it primarily affects the blood, the lower body is more severely impacted; if both qi and blood are affected, the condition is quite severe. Unless treated by a skilled physician and with the patient&#39;s undivided resolve, it is rare to escape from this affliction.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some patients come either from above or below, gradually developing their illness. These are diseases that can be treated. People often overlook the slow progression of the disease; even if treatment is applied according to this method, the disease may completely leave the body. However, if one cannot abstain from flavors and colors, they will inevitably relapse, and once relapsed, there is no hope for recovery.</p>
<p>I have treated five people, of whom only one woman was spared, because she was extremely poor and had little to eat. The other four patients relapsed after three years.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Epidemic Wind</strong></p>
<p>Epidemic wind refers to the pestilence noted in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; resulting from the harsh and lethal winds of heaven and earth, which are extremely fierce and fearsome. This condition may arise from various causes: first, due to wind poison, which can occur from sweating excessively while wearing wet clothes or being exposed to the wind after drinking; second, due to damp poison, which may result from sitting or lying on damp ground or being caught in rain and dew; third, due to contagion. However, it is not necessarily always from external sources. Internal injuries from diet, excessive heat toxins, severe cold or heat, and living in unclean conditions can also result in fire stirring blood heat and subsequently increasing susceptibility to external wind, cold, and dampness.</p>
<p>In the initial stages, one may experience superficial itching, or may develop white scales and purple patches resembling vitiligo, or purple blisters and nodules that ooze pus. When symptoms appear predominantly in the upper body, it indicates that the qi is affected and corresponds to more upper body involvement; when symptoms primarily manifest in the lower body, it indicates that the blood is affected and corresponds to more lower body involvement. If symptoms occur in both upper and lower body, both qi and blood are compromised. Conditions that ascend from the lower body to the upper body follow the pattern of &quot;reverse wind,&quot; while those descending from the upper to the lower body follow the pattern of &quot;normal wind.&quot; Those that manifest gradually from either direction can be treated, while sudden onset is more difficult to cure. </p>
<p>Mistakes in treatment may lead to skin death resulting in numbness, ceasing of pulses and blood turning to pus, death of muscle causing a lack of pain upon cutting, death of tendons leading to weakness in limbs, and death of bones causing the bridge of the nose to collapse. This could also result in drooping eyebrows, dimming vision, lips curling, speech becoming hoarse, and in extreme cases, corroding injuries to the eyes, decaying tissue, and contracted limbs. When the disease reaches this severity, it becomes nearly impossible to resolve.</p>
<p>The stomach and large intestine are capable of receiving everything. The spleen controls the muscles, and the lungs govern the skin. Though sores and scabs may be evident on the skin and flesh, the heat and toxins ultimately affect the stomach and intestines; thus, the treatment must first address the yangming region.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

After that, take Fangfeng Tongsheng San again, omitting nitrate, sulfur, and ephedra, and continue to take it frequently over a long period. Once the stomach&#39;s energy stabilizes, use Zaizao San to expel any remaining parasites. Moreover, if one prefers to expel parasites first and then the excessive saliva, after purging, continue using Fangfeng Tongsheng San, adjusting with additional ginseng, astragalus, and cooked rehmannia to stabilize energy and blood. If one has a weak spleen and stomach, the dosage of white atractylodes should be doubled.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

One should first take the Xieqing Pill to clear liver heat, and then treat according to the specific symptoms. For those with dryness and itchiness, use Siwu Decoction with wine and add floating duckweed powder, increasing the dosage of catnip and cicada shell for severe itchiness. For itchiness accompanied by skin lesions and white flakes, use the Baihua She Pill. For hair loss at the eyebrows, use San She Dan or a decoction of cypress leaves.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Treatment Method for Red and White Skin Spots</p>
<p>When the skin of the face, neck, and body changes color, the red spots are called &quot;red spots,&quot; and the white spots are &quot;white spots.&quot; These occur due to liver wind affecting the skin, resulting from disharmony of blood and qi. Red is associated with blood. For blood heat, use Jiuwu Qianghuo Decoction with honeysuckle and forsythia, or Four Substance Decoction with bupleurum, gardenia, and peony. For skin deficiency, use Xiaoyao Powder with gardenia or Shenqi Pill. White is associated with qi. For qi heat, use Baidu Powder or Small Chaihu Decoction with windproof and forsythia; for deficiency, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with Qianghuo and windproof. If it is due to wind toxin, use Huzhima Powder, Dan Cang&#39;er Pill, or Dan Fuping Pill. For chronic cases, it is best to nourish qi and blood, which will extinguish the fire, stabilize the wind, and stop the itching. If pungent and hot dispersing agents are used, it will only dry the liver blood, intensify the wind fire, and weaken the vital energy, making it difficult to treat. </p>
<p>For skin itch due to deficiency, where blood is not nourishing the pores, it is advisable to use Four Substance Decoction with Scutellaria, mixed with powdered violet for oral administration; or use powdered Lonicera flower with wine for oral administration. For widespread itching and dandruff on the scalp, use Dan Kusan Pill, or mix peppermint and cicada slough in equal parts, then take with wine.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When wind and cold penetrate together, they move through the pulse pathways, dispersing between the flesh and engaging with the protective qi. This obstructs their flow, causing the muscles and flesh to become strained and generate ulcers. When the protective qi coagulates and does not flow, the flesh becomes numb. With the presence of excessive heat in the nourishing and protective systems, the qi becomes unclear, resulting in the degradation of the nasal structure and skin ulcers. When wind and cold invade the pulse and do not depart, it is called pestilential wind. The treatment method should involve needling the muscles and bone marrow to release the excessive heat from the nourishing and protective systems. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; suggests using sharp needles to puncture and draw out the bad blood from swellings. Recent sages have stated that such disturbances arise from the malevolent qi brought forth by the changing of the seasons. If symptoms appear primarily in the upper body, the toxin is located above; if they appear mainly in the lower body, the toxin is below. It is thus understood that when the qi is affected by evil, it manifests more above, whereas when the blood is affected, it shows more below. If both qi and blood are affected, symptoms will appear in both the upper and lower parts.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the eyebrows fall first, the poison is in the lungs; if the face develops purple blisters, the poison is in the liver; if the soles of the feet ache or wear away first, the poison is in the kidneys; if the body is covered with sores, the poison is in the spleen; if the eyes are damaged first, the poison is in the heart. These are the serious conditions of the five organs. </p>
<p>First, the skin dies, leading to numbness; second, the flesh dies, resulting in insensitivity to needle pricks; third, the blood dies, causing ulceration; fourth, the tendons die, leading to dislocation of fingers; fifth, the bones die, resulting in nasal deterioration. These are injuries to the five organs that cannot be treated. If the voice becomes hoarse and the eyes go blind, it is particularly difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Generally, these conditions often stem from overexertion harming the Qi and blood, the pores not being tight, or from excess drinking, sexual activity, or bathing afterward, or from climbing mountains and fording waters, where external pathogens take advantage. The protective Qi clashes, damp heat transforms into fire, and blood turns into dryness due to fire, hence these ailments frequently occur in areas like Huaiyang, Lingnan, and Minyue.</p>
<p>Treatment should differentiate between original, accompanying, transformative, and similar conditions, as well as consider Yin and Yang, deficiency and excess. If one arbitrarily administers drying and heating treatments, resulting in profuse purulent discharge, it will further dry the liver&#39;s blood, intensify wind-heat, excessively harm the kidney&#39;s water, and amplify the fire of the heart, ultimately leading to deterioration of the condition.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

One should not universally apply toxic medicines; instead, assistance should first be given to the stomach to strengthen qi, thereby solidifying the foundation before treating the sores.</p>
<p>The classics state: if true qi is lost, then there is deficiency; if evil qi is abundant, then there is excess. Whenever it is said that the disease belongs to excess, one should consider it as deficiency.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize the differences in variations and similarities of the pestilential sores, leading to different treatment methods such as sweating, purging, needling, and either attacking or tonifying. In this regard, it is essential to evaluate the severity of concurrent symptoms, observe the sequence of changing symptoms, and identify the authenticity of similar symptoms. The methods of sweating, purging, needling, attacking, and tonifying should also take into account the individual&#39;s deficiency or excess, and thoroughly investigate the source of the illness in order to administer treatment. The deficient state refers to a deficiency in both form and qi, while the excessive state indicates a condition of pathogenic qi being abundant at the expense of form and qi, which then becomes deficient.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of treating sores and ulcers involves an approach where one sweat can replace a thousand needles, as the effects of bleeding are not as widespread as those of sweating. However, sweating leads to bleeding, and bleeding leads to sweating; they are interconnected. If stagnant, toxic blood is trapped in the skin and meridians, one should use both needling and sweating; taking blood from the middle of the body will be effective. If the toxicity is lodged in the organs, one must clear it from within to achieve recovery. If the poison is external, one must needling all affected areas, as well as the spaces between the fingers, hands, and toes, to disperse the toxicity. If both the exterior and interior are affected, without external needling and internal discharge, the poison cannot recede. If there are extensive issues in the upper body, it is advisable to use the Zui Xian San formulation to expel the stagnant toxic blood from the gums, and to needle the spaces between the fingers and the wrists to remove the toxic blood from the surface. For extensive issues in the lower body, it is best to use the Zai Zao San formulation to expel stagnant blood and parasites through the digestive tract, and additionally needle the spaces between the toes and wrists, repeating the needling every couple of days until the blood turns red.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is all due to internal deficiency leading to perspiration, loss of fluids and blood, and the tendons lacking nourishment, which are all symptoms of deficiency and not due to wind disorders; thus, the primary treatment should focus on greatly tonifying qi and blood. Therefore, postpartum women with ulcers, or those who suffer from labor injuries to qi and blood, and damp-heat with rising fire, often mistakenly take counteracting medicines and suffer as a result, as the reasons can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>For women with amenorrhea: if it is due to repressed fire injuring the spleen, use Gui Pi Decoction with added gardenia and moutan bark; if due to the intake of drying medicines injuring the blood, use Si Wu Decoction with added raw licorice; if the menstruation is overdue, it is due to deficiency of qi and blood, and use Ba Zhen Decoction with increased ginseng and atractylodes. If it comes early, it is due to blood deficiency heat, and use Si Wu Decoction with increased ginseng, atractylodes, and moutan bark. If there is pain before the onset, it is due to qi deficiency and blood stasis; use Si Wu Decoction with added poria, atractylodes, and cyperus. If the color is purple and forms lumps, it indicates blood heat; use Si Wu Decoction with added gardenia and moutan bark. If there is pain and the color is pale, it indicates deficiency of blood and qi; use Ba Zhen Decoction. For excessive menstrual bleeding due to the liver fire not being able to store blood, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If the spleen is deficient and cannot manage blood, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. All of these conditions arise from the six excesses and seven emotions that deplete the original qi, so one should carefully examine the causes and tonify the stomach qi appropriately.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p>The classification of symptoms refers to conditions that resemble each other in appearance but have different underlying causes. </p>
<p>For instance, if there are pustules resembling ringworm, and if intense scratching leads to oozing or lifting of white skin, this is termed kidney wind. The treatment is to use Si Sheng San to dispel wind evil, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If there&#39;s cloudiness in the head and eyes, internal heat, dry mouth, body fatigue, and phlegm heat, especially in autumn, it is commonly referred to as &quot;geese coming wind.&quot; The recommended treatment is Qiang Huo Bai Zhi San or Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. For those with qi deficiency, it should be supplemented with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang plus Zao Jiao Ci and Diao Teng Gou. For those with blood deficiency, add Chai Hu and Mu Dan Pi to Ba Wu Tang, or combine with Jia Wei Xiao Yao San for treatment.</p>
<p>If there is a condition affecting one limb or the space between the leg, arm, and wrist that is wandering and unstable, it is called &quot;red wandering wind&quot; if red, and &quot;white wandering wind&quot; if white.

<p><strong>Black and White Leprosy</strong></p>
<p>Leprosy is caused by bad winds or by touching forbidden things that lead to harm. At first, one may notice the skin turning black, and there can be a persistent itching sensation as if insects are crawling. Sometimes the sight becomes blurry as if experiencing a veil, speech becomes uncertain, and one often feels anxious. Internally, the skin may feel like it has red and black spots resembling peach or plum rashes, accompanied by numbness in the hands and feet, where pinpricks do not cause pain. The soles of the feet may hurt so much that one struggles to stand. During meals, when opening the mouth to breathe, there may be strange sounds, and speech can be similar. The body might develop sores and itchiness that feel like crawling insects, or the elbows may feel constricted. This condition is called Black Leprosy, also known as Black Spot.</p>
<p>For those suffering from White Leprosy, their voice is hoarse, vision is unclear, limbs are sore and painful, the body is very hot, and there is an inner feeling of irritation. The hands and feet move slowly, and there is tension in the back. It may feel like being pricked by needles inside, and sometimes rashes may develop. Often, the white spots are located within the skin, there can be polyps in the nose, or white pearls may appear in the eyes, obstructing vision.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The following text discusses various skin conditions related to wind and dampness in Traditional Chinese Medicine:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>(Nèihǔ) and (Nèiyuán)</strong>: When the body&#39;s Yang energy is weak externally, excessive sweating occurs, especially when exposed to wind. This wind interacts with the muscles and, combined with heat, produces (Nèihǔ)(Nèiyuán), resembling small beans. In severe cases, these can grow larger and scratching them can lead to sores.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Purple Spot Disease</strong>: This condition is characterized by the emergence of purple spots on the skin. Scratching causes the skin to rise without itch or pain. It is believed to result from wind and damp evil qi affecting the pores, clashing with the body&#39;s qi and blood, disrupting the balance of protective and nourishing forces, and causing the skin to take on a purple hue due to cold wind trapped between the muscles.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>White Spot Disease</strong>: This arises when there is obstruction of heat in the lungs, and wind externally injures the muscles. The interaction between heat and wind leads to the accumulation of harmful toxins in the pores, which struggles against the protective qi and cannot disperse. This creates raised, white patches on the skin, resulting in what is called white spot disease.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>White Fleck</strong>: According to &quot;Bingyuan Lun&quot;, white flecks appear on the face, neck, and skin, differing in color from normal flesh and are not itchy or painful, hence referred to as white fleck. This condition stems from wind evil affecting the skin and a disharmony in blood energies. White fleck results from wind in the lungs invading the skin, and if it persists without treatment, it can lead to long-lasting conditions. These tend to appear around the neck and face as small white spots without sores and lacking itch, making early treatment difficult, even when immersed in the condition.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Wind Pestilence</strong></p>
<p>Wind pathogen accumulates heat and dwells in the lungs. If it remains for a long time without dispersing, it overflows into the skin, causing spots and patches to naturally connect around the neck, chest, and armpits. These spots are slightly white and round, with some appearing purplish; they are neither painful nor itchy, referred to as wind pestilence. All of this is due to wind heat remaining lodged between the skin layers, causing disharmony in qi and blood, thus giving rise to this illness.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Pestilential Wind</strong></p>
<p>In treating pestilential wind, the primary focus is on cleansing the defensive and nutritive qi. Sweating should be encouraged frequently, and bloodletting should be done often, as these are quick methods to clear the defensive and nutritive qi. The presence of parasites is due to heat in the lungs, which prevents the qi from effectively dispersing. Thus, it gradually affects the skin and muscle layers, and there are parasites in the intestines and stomach. By cleansing the metal (lungs), the parasites will self-extinguish. When wind gold stirs, drought demons disappear, illustrating this principle clearly. However, to clear the lungs, one must first cleanse the defensive and nutritive qi, as their corruption prevents proper function and impairs the lung&#39;s purifying command. Bitter medicinals can purge the liver and kill parasites, but they can also harm the stomach and should not be taken for long periods. The stomach is the source of the emergence of defensive and nutritive qi. Prolonged use of bitter cold treatments causes the nutritive and defensive qi to weaken, leading to corruption and stagnation, which is difficult to express completely. Therefore, formulas like Ku Shen Wan should not be taken by those with weak defensive and nutritive qi who do not consume enough food. Semen Euphorbiae is particularly effective for killing parasites and expelling wind, yet it is overly hot and pungent, often causing damage to the eyes before the wind is expelled.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one consumes sulfuric wine, it will surely lead to the calamity of split brains. Moreover, taking drunken immortal powder mixed with light powder thrice daily will leave the person in a daze as if drunk, with toxic saliva oozing between the teeth, and while the plague may not be cured, the teeth will fall out first. Indeed, for the medicine to eliminate the plague, taking it infrequently and in small amounts will ensure it is ineffective; yet taking it for a long time and in large amounts may eliminate the plague, but the harm from the medicine will be even greater. Only the Easy Aging Wind-Dispelling Pill and Dongpo&#39;s Four Divine Pills can be taken for a long time to achieve results and be considered the proper method.</p>
<p>It is essential to know that when the pulse wind manifests, it becomes a plague. However, the essential blood of a person flows through the twelve channels. Using balanced and good medicines, focusing on generating blood and clearing heat as the main approach, and using wind-dispelling and insect-killing as supplements, along with practices that induce sweat and needling, will heal all.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What are the five winds? The first is the Yellow Wind, the second the Green Wind, the third the White Wind, the fourth the Red Wind, and the fifth the Black Wind. These winds correspond to the five viscera, hence they are called the Five Winds. The Five Winds produce the Five Worms: the Yellow Wind produces the Yellow Worm, the Green Wind produces the Green Worm, the White Wind produces the White Worm, the Red Wind produces the Red Worm, and the Black Wind produces the Black Worm. These five types of worms feast upon the five viscera of humans. If they consume the spleen, the speech becomes confused; if they consume the liver, the eyebrows and lashes fall; if they consume the heart, sores appear all over the body; if they consume the lungs, the nasal bridge collapses, and polyps grow within the nose; if they consume the kidneys, there is ringing in the ears, either like the sound of a car or thunder; if they consume the skin, it becomes hard and stiff; if they consume the tendons, the limbs become weak and fall apart. The Five Winds correspond to the Five Viscera, and the worms infiltrate the bones and marrow the most, coming and going without obstruction, damaging the human body, and are called the Swift Wind. The Swift Wind is the root of plague. When illness first arises, it may feel like being pricked by needles, known as the Stabbing Wind; or it may feel like crawling insects, known as the Creeping Wind; or it may cause painful contractions throughout the body, known as the Twitching Wind; or it may cause unnoticed pain and itching, known as the Stubborn Wind.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When flesh rises like the small pits of peaches and jujubes, if it arises from the head, it is called &quot;favorable wind&quot;; if it arises from the feet, it is called &quot;adverse wind.&quot; If there are patches resembling scattered coins, mottled red, white, blue, and black, it is called &quot;pestilential wind.&quot; Some may have sores all over the body, or resemble scabies, or fish scales, or elm pods, or coin holes, experiencing either pain or itchiness, with yellow fluid flowing out, and limbs rotting, all full of pus and blood. Some may be neither itchy nor painful, may arise or disappear, in shades of blue, yellow, red, white, or black, changing unpredictably. The cause of this illness is due to the interplay of hot and cold affecting the five organs, penetrating to the marrow, resulting from excessive exertion, conflicting diet, unregulated sexual activity, or excessive labor causing sweating all over the body. Consequently, accumulated heat penetrates the five organs, with impure diet leading to an abundance of worms that consume the five organs, marrow, skin, flesh, and tendons, resulting in decay over time, called &quot;pestilential wind.&quot; Therefore, it is said: if one wishes to treat this, one should first take a pill made from ferula (asafoetida) to expel the worms, observe their shape, whether blue, yellow, red, white, or black, and then administer medication, ensuring precision. If one contracts this illness, it is advisable to quickly abandon home, family, and possessions, retreat to the mountains for quiet recuperation, and treatment, ensuring no mistakes are made.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Pestilential wind, also known as great wind, is also called leprosy wind and commonly referred to as great leprosy. Although this disease is named &quot;wind,&quot; it is not caused by the external influence of wind. Instead, it arises from the malevolent evils present in the yin and filthy air of heaven and earth, where it may either transform due to the influence of wind and wood, causing heat and the emergence of insects, or it may arise from damp toxins in the skin and fur, subsequently affecting the body&#39;s defensive and nutritive qi. It can also result from uncleanliness or from contagion, all of which lead to the birth of insects. In essence, these insects are governed by the Liver&#39;s yin, which is associated with wind and wood, and is responsible for the emergence of various insects. The initial occurrence of the insects is not intentional, but as time goes on, they multiply, leading to a situation that is irredeemable. This is indeed the most malign, perilous, and disgraceful manifestation. Moreover, the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text states: &quot;Those who act unkindly are engaged in the most heinous acts, making it extremely difficult to treat.&quot; Observing the words of Master Sun, he mentioned that he treated hundreds of patients, yet not a single one escaped death, for none adhered to the necessary prohibitions.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Only one woman recovered from illness; after taking a modified Si Wu Decoction for over a hundred doses, she finally regained her menstruation after more than half a year, achieving complete recovery. Among the five patients treated by Danxi, only one woman escaped death due to her extreme poverty and lack of food; the other three or four individuals relapsed and died after two or three years. From this, it can be seen that extraordinary secret prescriptions are rarely effective in such cases. Therefore, when I encounter such conditions, I do not dare to hastily claim knowledge and recklessly apply treatments, nor do I boldly assert treatment methods that may mislead future generations. As for the ancient methods discussed in treatments, they are indeed very thorough; when applied appropriately, even if the root cause of the disease may not be completely eradicated, one can still prolong their years and avoid premature death. Thus, after extensive inquiry into various opinions, Xue Lijia&#39;s &quot;Essentials of Epidemic Diseases&quot; stands out as the most comprehensive. </p>
<p>Epidemic diseases often feature accompanying or changing symptoms; all types of illnesses caused by internal or external organs have these characteristics, and their respective treatment methods have already been articulated in various schools. One should appropriately adapt treatments based on the symptoms presented, ensuring comprehensive support, as all methods can yield good outcomes. Due to the extensive information available, I shall not elaborate further on this matter. </p>
<p><strong>Prohibitions</strong></p>
<p>Those suffering from this illness often do so due to a lack of restraint in their desires. To treat this illness, one must promptly cease consuming meat, strong flavors, salty sauces, and all heavy foods, and instead cultivate a calm heart and minimal desires, avoiding distractions and immersing oneself in natural surroundings. One should also abandon worldly concerns and seek treatment early; doing so may increase the chance of survival. If one does not adhere to these prohibitions, relapses are likely, leading to severe consequences that may be beyond remedy; this is all due to the failure to observe these restrictions.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescription for the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epidemic diseases are related to the miasma of the Two Guangdong regions, transformed by heat and humidity. The qi is predominantly hot rather than cold, and the symptoms include headaches and abdominal fullness. Locals who consume areca nut are not harmed by it as it disperses the symptoms due to its pungency. The essence of fire, when cooled by cold, becomes suppressed and unable to manifest; thus, the pungent nature of areca nut readily enters the body and its flavor effectively disperses, making it appropriate for the illness. However, it can only alleviate urgent situations temporarily and should not be relied upon as a permanent solution.</p>
<p>Now, I establish a formula to continuously combat the invasion of miasma. Use one qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and areca nut; five qians of white atractylodes; three qians each of poria and ophiopogon; five fen each of tangerine peel, licorice, bitter orange peel, and bupleurum; and five grains of schisandra. Boil these in water and take them.</p>
<p>The wonders of this formula do not originate from what is typically used to treat miasma, but rather, it alleviates the condition itself. Strengthening the spleen enhances qi, which in turn prevents miasma from invading. For those already affected, the formula contains herbs that expel miasma—how could it fail to yield effective results? This method of treating miasma is important to understand. However, if someone suffers from miasma and develops severe leprosy, this treatment is not appropriate.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Leprosy is primarily caused by the accumulation of pathogenic heat and toxins, which envelop the skin, while dampness is concealed within the muscles and bones. This results in external symptoms such as redness of the skin, loss of hair, and widespread rotting, emitting a stench that makes it unbearable for anyone to approach for treatment. I feel a deep sorrow for this, so I devised a unique formula using four taels each of Yuan Shen, Cang Zhu, Shu Di, Cang Er Zi, Yi Ren, and Fu Ling, named the Six-Four Decoction. Each ingredient is ground into a powder and made into pills with honey. Taking one tael daily will surely lead to complete recovery. The brilliance of this formula lies in its ability to tonify the kidney and strengthen the spleen, while also dispersing wind and eliminating dampness. When the body is properly nourished, the pathogens naturally retreat, so there is no need to directly treat the leprosy itself—it will resolve on its own. It’s recommended to have this printed and distributed widely; the merits of this act cannot be quantified. One should only avoid sexual activity. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is another formula using one qian of betel nut, eight fen of Chai Hu, and three qian each of Bai Zhu, Bai Shao, Bai Jiao Zi, and Fu Ling, with two qian of Che Qian Zi and five fen of Zhi Ke, all boiled in water for oral consumption. If there is heat, add five fen of Huang Lian and boil again for oral consumption. Two doses will alleviate the condition as well, which is also a remarkable formula. </p>
<p>For leprosy, I have yet another extraordinary formula using two taels each of Cang Zhu, Shu Di, Yuan Shen, Cang Er Zi, Bai Jiao Zi, Che Qian Zi, and fresh Gan Cao, along with ten taels of Jin Yin Hua and four taels of Pu Gong Ying, all ground into a powder and made into pills. One dose will lead to complete recovery.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Kushen Stone-Dissolving Wine; the method of infusion is explained below.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Kushen, Stone-Dissolving, Clear Wine.</p>
<p>Take these three ingredients and first infuse the Stone-Dissolving in Clear Wine for either twenty-seven days or thirty-seven days. Then, combine with Kushen and place into a wine jar to steep for seven days, gradually consuming it. </p>
<p>Dosage: Take on an empty stomach, three times a day. During the first seven days, consume about the size of a half egg at a time. After seven days, you may drink up to a liter, as much as you feel inclined. The more you consume, the better; the illness will diminish quickly. If you experience excessive wind movement, avoid getting drunk or vomiting; it is better to drink less gradually rather than too much all at once.</p>
<p>This remedy is effective against both red and white wind; for this medicine, it is guaranteed to heal all ailments. Other illnesses are not difficult to treat. Why? Because heat is the root cause. Thus, Kushen can treat heat, and the Stone-Dissolving eliminates heat and expels worms. For both red and white worms, merely inhaling the essence of the Stone-Dissolving will turn them into water, effectively addressing the root of heat.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one suffers from the dual afflictions of red and white wind, regardless of how long it has been, even after five years, adding yellow消石, alcohol, and bitter herbs (such as苦参) in quantities of three to four taels will lead to recovery. Even after thirty years, if there is no falling away of the nose, fingers, or joints, and provided there are no black worms, all can achieve lasting recovery. First, avoid sexual activity, excessive anger, and hot foods. Refrain from sticky foods, five pungent vegetables, cold dishes, strong vinegars, alcohol, and meats like pork, fish, chicken, dog, donkey, horse, and lamb; all these are major prohibitions, while other foods are not restricted. This is a treatment method, not a fundamental cure. If someone experiences stubborn numbness without feeling pain or itchiness in certain areas, they should apply a thick white plaster and massage it three to four times a day for seven days, or continue for two or three sessions of seven days each, up to a total of forty-nine days, which is termed one complete treatment. If the numbness resolves and the itchiness subsides as before, one should stop massaging. If it does not resolve, continue to massage until healed. Generally, two or three complete treatments will suffice for recovery. Techniques like acupuncture, moxibustion, or incisions are not as effective as this method of massage. Even if one has many scars, massaging them will surely lead to healing.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

Drill holes at the bottom of the vessel and place twenty or thirty green stones, about the size of peaches, plums, or eggs, over the bottom hole by two or three inches. Then add the bitter sophora, disintegrated stone powder, and wine all at once into the vessel. Have a boy of thirteen or fourteen mix and stir well. Immediately, cover the vessel&#39;s mouth with several layers of old paper and seal it with clay to prevent air leakage. When taking the wine, ensure that it flows out through the hole; do this once a day, or even twice if necessary. Afterward, seal the hole tightly again to prevent leaking. Do not open the vessel to take the wine. When the wine nears depletion, open the vessel to retrieve the bitter sophora residue, strain to extract the wine, and discard the residue. Keep the wine in a sealed place to avoid air leakage; the method of taking the wine remains as described earlier, and there will be no failure to heal.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses various remedies for specific ailments. Here’s the translation:</p>
<p>For the disease characterized by a collapsed nose and distorted hands and feet, with unbearable pain in the joints leading to eventual loss of limbs: use one ounce of peeled castor beans and one ounce of yellow gentian, size of large beans, soak these in one liter of water in a small bottle. Soak for two days in spring and summer, and five days in autumn and winter. Afterward, take one castor bean, break it, face east, and swallow it immersed in the medicinal water. Gradually increase to four or five beans; a slight benefit is not a problem. Add more water to the bottle as it diminishes. After two months, try eating garlic and pork; if it does not react, the remedy is effective. If an issue arises, continue taking until there is no reaction.</p>
<p>For the severe wind-leprosy: in March and April, harvest the seedlings and roots of Aconitum and do not wash off the soil. Grind the juice to soak small black beans, rubbing off the skins that do not fall off. After one night, take them out, dry them, and soak them again, repeating this seven times. Initially swallow three beans, gradually increase to six or seven beans. Avoid pork, chicken, and garlic in the living quarters; violating this may lead to death.</p>
<p>For the wind-scald disease, with widespread black spots on the body, accompanied by numbness and intermittent pains: take one pound of black Aconitum, scrape and wash off the skins thoroughly, then dry it. Mix with four ounces of clear oil and four ounces of salt in a pan, stir-fry until a deep yellow color. Pour out the excess oil, leaving only the salt and medicine, and stir-fry until black smoke is released. Take one piece, break it, and if there is a small white point like rice in the center, it is good; if more white, continue frying. While hot, grind to a powder, mix with vinegar to form pills the size of walnuts, taking thirty pills each time with warm wine on an empty stomach. The black Aconitum is very toxic; it is advisable to consume porridge made with black beans over five or seven days to counteract the poison.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The &quot;Suwen&quot; says:</strong> For serious wind diseases, if the bones and joints are heavy, and the hair falls out, it is called “great wind.” Acupuncture of the muscles leads to sweat for a hundred days. Acupuncture of the bone marrow also leads to sweat for a hundred days. Overall, for two hundred days, once the hair grows back, stop acupuncture. For pestilential wind, one should first needle the swellings, and after needling, use a sharp needle to puncture that area to press out the bad qi, stopping only when the swelling is gone. Regularly consume regular food, and avoid other foods. <strong>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure Mirror&quot; cites:</strong> The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: Wind leads to pestilence. Moreover, it says: The wind energy and the sun enter the pathways of the meridians, dispersing among the muscles, interfering with the protective qi, leading to swelling and harm in the flesh; because the protective qi becomes stagnant and doesn’t circulate, the muscles become numb. Pestilential wind involves the warming and protecting influence being not clear, leading to ruin of the nasal columns and discoloration, skin ulcers, and cold and wind residing in the meridians without dissolution, named pestilential wind, or named cold-heat disease.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The affliction known as &quot;Great Wind&quot; causes heaviness in the joints, drooping of the eyebrows and hair, and is named &quot;Great Wind&quot; because it pierces the muscles. Thus, sweating occurs for a hundred days, and piercing the bone marrow causes sweating for a hundred days as well, totaling two hundred days until the hair and eyebrows grow back and the needling ceases. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; it is stated: the method of using acupuncture for pestilential sores, Zhang Zihe said that a single sweat is worth a thousand needles, for acupuncture draws blood less effectively than sweating does in a comprehensive manner. Nevertheless, sweating leads to blood loss, and blood loss leads to sweating; they are one and the same. If the stagnant toxic blood accumulates on the surface of the muscles and meridians, it is advisable to puncture the Weizhong point to draw out blood for efficacy. If the toxic accumulation resides in the internal organs, it cannot heal without cleansing it from within. If the poison is located externally, not only must the diseased areas be needled, but blood must be drawn from the seams of the arms, legs, hands, and feet, for the toxin cannot disperse. If both the interior and exterior are poisoned, without external needling to draw out the internal toxins, it cannot possibly retreat. </p>
<p>If the upper body is more affected, it is suitable to use &quot;Drunken Immortal Powder&quot; to expel the toxic blood from between the teeth and to pierce the seams of the fingers and along the arms to remove the superficial toxic blood. If the lower body is more affected, it is appropriate to use &quot;Restorative Powder&quot; to allow the toxic blood and lingering parasites to emerge from the digestive tract; along with this, needling the seams of the toes and wrists should be done, with a gap of one or two days between sessions, using the color of the blood as a measure. If there are symptoms of toxic heat and headaches, the primary focus should be on greatly replenishing qi and blood.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Rujun Shiqin&quot; states: Zhu Ge treated his family&#39;s leprosy and sought help from Dai, who declined, saying it would be treatable in five to six months. This spring, it was still cold, and medicine could not yet be taken; I had already prepared my travel gear to Wanqiu, waiting to concoct the medicine in five to six months. Zhu Ge believed this to be an excuse. Later, Dai indeed arrived at Zhu Ge in June, prepared garlic, duckweed, and other medicines, instructing someone to summon Zhu Ge, saying: &quot;The medicine is ready, you may come for treatment.&quot; Zhu Ge, bewildered by other medicines, did not go. Dai remarked: &quot;It was not an excuse before; in early spring, sweating was not possible due to the cold, but in the hotter months, it is easier to sweat. Acupuncture is the same as inducing sweat. However, for those without medicine, acupuncture can achieve the same effect as a thousand needles. Thus, Gao Gongfeng sang the tune of gathering duckweed: &#39;Not in the mountains, not on the shores, gather me in mid-July, distinguishing between paralysis wind and weakness wind; minor breezes do not count. Drop three pills in bean wine, the iron cap will also result in sweating.&#39; Alas! Scholars belittle each other, physicians harm each other.

His eyebrows had fallen out, and applying hot soup provided some relief. He had to apply it several times day and night; even acupuncture provided some improvement. The venerable teacher said: The pulse of wind signifies a pathogenic wind. When the Wei and Ying (defensive and nutritive qi) become heated and cloudy, it damages the nasal bridge and discolors the skin. Severe wind indicates that wind and cold settle in the meridians and do not disperse. The treatment should involve needling the swollen areas with sharp needles to expel the harmful qi, stopping only when the swelling subsides. One should regularly consume prescribed food and avoid other foods.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Cases&quot; states: A man experienced bitterness in his mouth and tinnitus during winter, accompanied by itching and dampness in the scrotum. In spring, he developed purple spots on his face, slight swelling, and numbness, which progressed to widespread purple discoloration by winter, without any pain or itching. By spring, the purple areas grew larger, and in summer, they began to ulcerate; by spring, his eyebrows had fallen out and ulcers formed on his fingers. This illness was located in the liver and gallbladder meridians, and the treatment involved needling the spaces between his fingers, as well as on his arms and legs, drawing out dark blood. Initially, he was given &quot;Zai Zao San&quot; (Rebuilding Powder) two doses to clear the toxic filth, and then combined &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang&quot; (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with &quot;Si Wu Tang&quot; (Four Substance Decoction), adding Bai Zhi, Fang Feng, Tian Ma, and Jiao Ci, which gradually improved his condition. He was also given &quot;Huan Ji San&quot; (Muscle Change Powder). However, he presented with slight redness all over, indicating a deficiency of blood with heat; due to financial difficulties, he had not received proper treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man presented with a red and purple face, itching and pain in the lower body, heat in the afternoon, and dry black stools. This indicated excessive fire and deficient blood. Treatment included Zai Zao San and Si Wu Tang, supplemented with Fang Ji and Dan Cao, to expel toxic blood through the toes, leading to improved bowel movements. The previous medications were then supplemented with Bai Zhu, Bai Zhi, Fu Ling, Qiang Huo, and Du Huo, resulting in yellow stools. Si Wu Tang was used again without Dan Cao and Fang Ji, with reduced use of Du Huo, and added Yuan Shen and Bi Xie. After more than fifty doses, the lesions receded. Later, a formula to tonify the middle and boost Qi with Tian Ma and Mai Men was administered to gradually restore Qi and blood. During the rainy late autumn, Qing Zao Tang was employed for comfort. Subsequently, Huan Ji San, Hu Ma San, and Ba Zhen Tang were taken together for recovery.</p>
<p>A patient in an upper chamber experienced facial swelling, skin resembling eczema, which later developed into purple lumps that leaked fluid when scratched, a manifestation of spleen and lung issues. Initially, Qing Wei Tang was used to clear stomach heat and resolve exterior toxins, followed by Si Wu Tang with Shan Zhi, Huang Qin, Chai Hu, Zao Jiao Ci, and Gan Cao to nourish the blood and dispel wind-heat. The affected areas of the arms, legs, wrists, hands, and toes were treated with acupuncture to remove toxic blood and clear channels. Lastly, Ba Zhen Tang was combined with Bai Zhi, Zao Jiao Ci, Wu Jia Pi, Quan Xie, and Er Sheng San for over a month to nourish Yin blood and address sores and toxins. There was slight improvement with Bu Qi Xie Rong Tang, followed by Huan Ji San for full recovery. However, due to overexertion, red rashes reappeared, particularly exacerbated in the afternoon, for which Si Wu Tang was adjusted with Dan Pi, Chai Hu, and Shan Zhi, alongside the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for over a year, allowing him to work without worsening his condition.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man was covered in sores like scabs, scratching them caused them to fester, his skin was purple and numb, pressing on them caused pain, and he had infrequent and scanty urination. This indicated an illness from the spleen and stomach, with the symptoms mainly on the surface. I used the Qingwei Powder and also needled the affected areas along with the arms and legs to draw out dark blood, which gradually improved his spirit; however, he still felt cold, fatigued, and had a dry mouth. This indicated that the evil qi had departed but genuine qi was deficient. I administered large doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, ligusticum, evodia, and platycodon, restoring his essential qi rapidly. Then I used the Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus, angelica, evodia, gastrodia, softened bupleurum, and the Two Holy Powder to treat him, which led to gradual recovery of the sores. Later, he had a recurrence but mistakenly used aggressive methods to attack the toxins, resulting in him suffering from both cold and warm pathogens and ultimately leading to death.</p>
<p>Another man had bumps all over his body; scratching did not cause itching, and pressing did not cause pain. He suffered from constipation and thirst; this indicated that the evil was internal. I prescribed the Zai Zao Powder twice, which slightly purged three times. I then used the Peaches and Plums Purging Decoction with four doses of angelica and needled to resolve the pathological blood, which gradually relieved the pain and itching. However, he felt fatigued, so I used tonifying medicine to restore his essential qi. Additionally, I used the Two Holy Powder, causing the sores to heal rapidly. I further applied substantial tonics, and after a year, he recovered. Later, he suffered from an accumulation of phlegm and sputum, with a stiff tongue and slurred speech. I used the Er Chen Decoction along with four doses of atractylodes, unhusked barley, and plantain, which led to his recovery, and then used the Bao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to adjust and stabilize his condition.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man lived in great distress; his eyebrows had completely fallen out, and he was ill from ailments affecting the liver and gallbladder. He pricked his arms, legs, and the afflicted areas to release black blood, taking Eight Treasures Decoction with added ingredients of five flavors, sesame, and Polygonum multiflorum. After eating, he took a medicinal powder to change the flesh. He was pleased that there were no complications and was able to strictly adhere to prescribed restrictions. In less than half a year, he recovered.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar experienced itching and pain in the soles of his feet, or numbness and swelling. After two years, his body began to itch, gradually developing bumps, with heat and ringing in the ears that worsened in the afternoon; this was a sign of kidney deficiency. He treated it by pricking his arms, legs, and the spaces between his fingers to drain the stagnant blood, using a combination of Liuwei Dihuang pills with added five flavors and over fifty doses of Chaihu to tonify the kidneys. He also employed a powder to expel wind and treat sores, each weighing several jin. Gradually, the sores healed, as he received nourishment and adhered to restrictions.</p>
<p>A man in higher status was afflicted all over, his overall condition weak. I suggested he needed tonification to restore his vital energy before treating the sores. He did not believe this and instead consumed snake wine to attack internal toxins and applied arsenic and other medicines to corrode external toxins, which immediately led to vomiting of clear water and body pain like being pierced by a nail. Some thought the toxic gas was exiting his body; I pointed out that the spleen governs muscles, and this was due to the poison injuring the spleen. In contrast, taking detoxifying agents led to relentless vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in death.</p>
<p>Another man used a medicinal wash, and despite not sweating, suffered from wheezing, cough, loss of appetite, abdominal rumbling, cold extremities, and muscle spasms. This was caused by heat damaging vital energy, resulting in loose pores and loss of yang. That very day, he indeed died.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>
