<p><strong>External Medicine: Heat Sores, Acne, Boils, Cauterization, Frostbite</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Discussion of Vital Energy Communicating with Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Excessive sweating leads to exhaustion, causing a person to become weak. Sweating while damp results in the emergence of acne. Dietary changes leading to rich foods can cause severe boils. If one is exhausted as if holding back energy, laboring under the wind, or subjected to cold, it can result in skin rashes or acne.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The terms &quot;rashes&quot; and &quot;acne&quot; refer to mild symptoms of blood stagnation at the skin surface, indicating that the yang energy, which protects the skin, is weakened by evil influences, causing the thinning of blood in the skin and resulting in illness. Thus, it is stated that excessive sweating leads to exhaustion, which makes one weak, meaning that vital energy should be as widespread as heaven and the sun over the land. The emergence of acne and rashes implies that the protective yang energy exists between the skin and hair. Dietary changes leading to rich food indicate that the vitality must circulate through the pores.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>On the Large Theory of Qi Transformation</strong><br>In the year of the Wood element, when it is not sufficient, it leads to scorching heat, flowing fire, dampness turning dry, causing illnesses such as chills, fevers, sores, rashes, blockages, abscesses, and acne.<br>[Note: All these diseases stem from heat.]</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Golden Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Heat Sores and Prickly Heat</strong><br>Whenever heat sores arise, they produce white pus, which is commonly known as purulent sores today. Initially, they are shallow and only emit yellow liquid; this is called fatty sores, also known as yellow rotten sores. They first appear similar to fatty sores, are prone to contact with hands and feet, often appearing in pairs, and may wax and wane with the months, causing pain and itching, cracking. They can occur in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Those that worsen are called quenching sores.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Prickly Heat</strong><br>Prickly heat, referred to in the <em>Suwen</em> as prickly heat acne, is treated with fragrant powder mixed with (tansy) saltpeter, and as usual, add a bit of dried white alum powder.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> by Li Zhan (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Acne</strong></p>
<p>In the summer heat, if the heart and mind become distressed and irritable, and the heat leads to sweating and dampness, sores will appear all over the body, sometimes with pus and blood, red and inflamed like fire. Use one qian each of nux vomica, pinellia, coptis, and coptis chinensis, and five fen each of gallnut and yellow powder, ground into a powder and applied dry. If itching increases, add burnt alum and realgar. Regularly taking coptis and donkey-hide gelatin pills can help clear internal heat. </p>
<p>When sores form from the heat and dampness of sweat, causing persistent itching and pain, use two qian each of astragalus, angelica, ledebouriella, and schizonepeta, along with ground brick powder (one liang). Boil these herbs in three large bowls of water until reduced to five or six bowls, then strain out the residue, slightly warm, and wash the affected areas. Dry them and avoid wind; it will be effective shortly. For mild cases, simply use wax snow water mixed with clam powder as a poultice.</p>
<p>Heat rash acne occurs due to excessive sweating and moisture. In mild cases, it appears like sprinkled millet. Wash with a decoction of sweet wormwood or the leaves of jujubes for relief. In severe cases of moist heat leading to numerous sores, use five qian each of mung bean and talc powder, applying it with cotton. If the sores are broken, add five qian each of coptis and jujube leaves, along with a bit of ground brain.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Diagnostic and Treatment Principles</strong> by Wang Kentang (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Acne</strong></p>
<p>Acne is also known as a small abscess, commonly referred to as a hot abscess. Wang’s commentary states: it can be as large as a sour jujube or as small as a bean, red in color and containing pus and blood. According to Haizang, sweating and exposure to dampness can lead to acne and abscesses. Acne appears red and swollen, with pus and blood inside.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>External Medicine Authentic Text</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Chen Shigong</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Acne</strong>  </p>
<p>Acne appears densely like scattered grains, sharp like thorny prickles, causing intense itching and pain all over the body. This is due to heat in the body being exposed to wind, causing the hair pores to close. It is advisable to take a wind-dispelling powder and wash with a bitter herb decoction. In severe cases, when skin lesions form into sores, use a mixture of medicinal powder on soft silk fabric to dab the affected area.  </p>
<p><strong>Secret Manuscript of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatments for Skin Conditions</strong>  </p>
<p>Rash and sores occur due to heat injury from summer. Washing with snow water is more effective; wash until the rash diminishes. If this is not available, an excellent remedy is to cut cucumber into slices and rub them on the skin, which will lead to healing. This is a method of treating skin and fur conditions.  </p>

<ul>
<li>For soft boils that do not heal: grind the bottom of a rotten boat with oil lime into a fine powder and mix it with oil to apply.</li>
<li>For all kinds of sores and boils: mix equal parts of earth vermilion and hide glue into a powder, dissolve in a bowl of fine wine and drink it after clarifying; use the residue for external application, reapply when dry.</li>
<li>For heat rashes and itching: decoct and drink light pricklyash, and wash with it.</li>
<li>Slices of winter melon rubbed on the rash are very effective.</li>
<li>For itching from rashes: scrape red and white chalk powder from old rafters to apply.</li>
<li>For already burst boils: pounding motherwort and applying it is very effective.</li>
<li>For swollen and toxic boils: apply the leaves of mouse glue.</li>
<li>For small boils with fever: dry the powder of Pungent Grass and take one or two qian with hot wine, repeating several times, which stops the painful heat.</li>
<li>For ulcers that have already ruptured: slightly scrape the skin off the root of cow knee, insert it into the ulcer, leaving half an inch exposed, and apply a handful of tender orange leaves and carpet grass, pounded together on top. Cow knee can eliminate bad blood, and the two herbs warm and cool to relieve pain. Change as it dries for complete efficacy.</li>
<li>For toxic and foul necrotic flesh from boils: take three jin of rehmannia, boil with one dou of water to extract three sheng, strain and reduce to a thick decoction, apply on paper and paste it on, changing three times daily.</li>
<li>For swollen and toxic boils: grind deer antler tips into a thick juice to apply, which is very effective.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Bumps at the temples:</strong> Take a handful of fur from a cat&#39;s head and a handful of fur from a pig&#39;s neck, along with one grain of rat droppings. Burn and grind them, then mix with oil and apply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toxic boils:</strong> Burn dog skull to produce smoke and expose the affected area to it.</p>
<p><strong>Frequent soft boils:</strong> Use two pieces of bee&#39;s wax after burning until preserved; combine with twenty-one grains of croton seeds, boil in clear oil until it reaches two or three boils. Remove the seeds and apply the oil mixture for significant effect.</p>
<p><strong>Soft boils and various heat sores:</strong> Use seven pieces of gallnuts, grind into powder, mix with four ounces of fragrant oil, boil until it reduces by half. Strain out the residue, apply three to four times without washing with water.</p>
<p><strong>Initial onset of breast boils:</strong> Apply yellow adhesive mixed with concentrated vinegar for immediate relief.</p>
<p><strong>Soft boils on a child&#39;s head that haven’t healed for three to four years:</strong> Use two qian of old pine resin, and forty-nine grains of castor bean flesh, grind together into powder, mix with a little tea oil, and cook to make a paste. Apply this to the boil using cloth for seven days; once removed, healing will occur.</p>
<p><strong>Black powder:</strong> Treats boil toxins. Use ram&#39;s horn with meat and bones, burn until preserved and grind into powder. Mix with three qian of wine and take in two doses; it can disperse the sores. Note that this formula is rarely ingested; it is a secret remedy. Commonly treats facial conditions or sudden red spots on the body—whether itchy or boil-like, if not treated, can lead to death. Burn the ram&#39;s horn until preserved, grind into very fine powder and mix with egg white for application; it is very effective. This is also stated in classic texts.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Frequent soft abscesses: Use jade ointment. Take eight taels of clear asphalt, two taels of copper green, three taels of sesame oil, and three pig gall bladders. First, melt the asphalt, then add the oil and gall, pour it into water to stir and pull apart, and store it in a container. Use scarlet silk to apply it, and there is no need to change it.</p>
<p>For soft abscesses on the head: Apply frog skin to the affected area; it will absorb the poison and heal.</p>
<p>To prevent sores and abscesses: Every year on June 6th, have children swallow soap pods according to their age; this can prevent sores and abscesses. Adults can also swallow seven or twenty-one pods.</p>
<p>Once the boil has burst: Roll the root bark of the peony into a string and insert it, then it will not close up and will allow pus to drain easily.</p>
<p>At the initial stage of a boil: Burn kudzu vines until ash, mix with water and apply it; this will eliminate it.</p>
<p>Medical case:</p>
<p>In &quot;Rumen Shiqin,&quot; it is stated that a provincial official had acne on his nape that would heal and then recur. A doctor said: &quot;This is due to excess yang blood.&quot; First, let it flow out; then use a needle to draw out purple blood from the Weizhong point, and the condition will not recur.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>&quot;The Meaning of Grasses&quot; says: Huang Hongxuan suddenly developed a boil on his arm, swollen and without a head, causing extreme pain that was unbearable. All the external doctors claimed it was caused by hot toxins. However, considering his usual demeanor—detached, with a clear intention, and a calm heart—there was certainly no source of heat or toxic causes. Ultimately, he could not identify the origin of the issue. I suggested to respected Gong and Chang Shan that we set aside wine and food to consult a cook instead. Chang replied, “Let me first congratulate you on this condition, then I will speak of it.” </p>
<p>Every sore and ulcer arises for a reason. External causes include the toxic effects of the improper actions of heaven or the miasma from living and moving. Internal causes include the heat from rich wine and flavor, or the fire of pent-up anger. The treatment of fire toxins differs from that of other toxins; in essence, fire and original energy cannot coexist. By applying cold, the original energy will transform and flow. Consequently, Hongxuan found no reason here, and did not question the possibility of retained fetal toxins. </p>
<p>All humans receive the qi of heaven and earth, differing in purity. Those who are pure in essence are blessed with longevity without limits. However, since individuals are formed from the essence of their parents, it is unavoidable that they are mixed with the desire fire of their physical bodies. What is required is the action of smallpox, which expels the hidden desire fire from the body, restoring the pure essence to its constant form. This process is akin to refining ore; it is necessary to subject the ore to fire in order to separate the dross from the pure gold.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>I have often observed the eyes of those who have had smallpox by this method. Seven or eight days later, when they open their eyes, those with clear distinctions between black and white have pure vitality, while those with red veins and membranes are mixed vitality. As for those with blurry pupils and no glimmer of spirit, they are completely devoid of vitality. When Hong Xuan was young, he had an excessive outbreak of smallpox, and his vital energy could not fully replenish. Additionally, he was hindered by other ailments. Although the fire and toxins in his organs were cleared, the remnants in his body persisted. Therefore, the eruptions of smallpox would inevitably appear in the joints of the hands and feet or the Crooked Pool, as minor toxins, unable to find suitable refuge, would hide in difficult-to-reach areas of respiration.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Nowadays, the boils and carbuncles occur specifically at the points of the knee, and there is no doubt about the toxic nature of the pox. The poison lies beneath the elbows and armpits, originally causing no harm. However, the pure essence of the body has slight impurities, which are but subtle dust in a precious mirror or the minor flaw in a white jade. The sun, representing great harmony and vital energy, fills the body; it aims to expel the remnants from fifteen years ago, transforming them into pus and blood. Others see this as poison, but I have foreseen it as an opportunity for healing. Is it possible to be relaxed in the limbs without any manifestation in one’s endeavors?</p>
<p>The treatment involves externally using purslane to quickly break it apart, and internally employing the Baoyuan Decoction to thoroughly eliminate it. Additionally, applying the medicinal treatments used for pox will ensure recovery by the end of the day. It will certainly not resemble the prolonged agony of toxic sores. However, if one fails to recognize the signs and indiscriminately uses cold and draining treatments for sores, they only exacerbate the affliction. Who would say that minor ailments in surgery could be neglected without the intervention of a skilled practitioner? If treated according to this method, a significant amount of pus will be discharged; there is no need for regenerating flesh to heal on its own.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p>
<h3>Burns and Similar Conditions</h3>
<p>For burns, one must be cautious not to wash with cold water. When a burn is exposed to cold, the heat penetrates deeper into the bones, making it difficult for the muscles and bones to heal. When first burned, one should quickly apply more heat from the fire; although it is very painful, enduring it will lead to relief after a while, which is remarkably effective. For treating burns, one should use fresh urine to drink cold, or mix cold water with honey to drink. If the mouth is closed, one must pry it open and then use various remedies to treat the condition.</p>
<h3>Frostbite</h3>
<p>The classics say: frostbite reveals clear fluid, commonly referred to as frostbite. If it does not heal for many years, use pure soil from the wild, dried in the sun, and grind garlic into a paste. Form it into cakes, sized according to the area of injury, thick as a large coin, and apply them to the wound. Then use moxa on the cake; the quantity is not fixed, just rely on the drying of the paste. After the cake dries, replace it with a wet cake for moxibustion, regardless of how many times, until the scab feels painful or itchy, indicating that the wound can be treated. Then, hold some damp starch in the mouth and wash the area using twenty strands of chicken feathers tied together as a brush. This method cleans the wound without damaging the flesh. Dry with soft cloth and apply a mixture of sandalwood and betel nut powder. It is especially effective if treated in summer.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case Studies (Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Scald and Burn Sores</strong></p>
<p>For the symptoms of scald and burn sores, if there is fever and thirst, with red and turbid urine, use the Four Substances, Mountain Fragrant, Forsythia, and Licorice to nourish yin and blood to dispel toxins. If the affected area is not necrotic but painful, use the Four Noble Herbs, Chuanxiong, Angelica, Mountain Fragrant, Forsythia, and Licorice to strengthen the spleen and stomach to disperse toxins. If the affected area has necrotic tissue but is not ulcerated, use the Eight Treasures, Bai Zhi, and Licorice to tonify qi and blood to expel pus; if not effective, add cinnamon. If dead tissue has ulcerated and is not closing up, use the Four Noble Herbs, Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Astragalus to strengthen the spleen and stomach to promote tissue regeneration; if not effective, add roasted ginger. If a child suffers from this condition, or shows symptoms like eye rolling and head shaking, use the Four Noble Herbs with Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Mountain Fragrant to strengthen the spleen and stomach to clear liver heat. If symptoms appear after eating, or if there is abdominal distension and pain, use the Four Noble Herbs, Mountain Fragrant, Hawthorn, and Spirit Ferment to strengthen spleen qi for digestion. Generally, in the early stages of this condition, applying Effective Angelica Ointment can lead to spontaneous healing in mild cases, while severe cases may lead to necrosis and regeneration of healthy tissue. If the color is red, it indicates lingering fire toxins, and it is essential to apply until the area turns white. If the sores are located at joint flexures, applying this may hinder the formation of scabs and impede new tissue regeneration. If one suffers from death due to smoke inhalation, administering juice from radishes can revive them, as its spiciness helps disperse trapped qi.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Burns from Boiling and Fire</strong></p>
<p>For burns from boiling water and fire, at first, it is advisable to endure the pain. Immediately apply heat; be careful not to use cold objects to compress the area, as this will prevent the heat from escaping and cause decay into the muscles and bones. Later, use seven taels of frost-water stone, one tael each of huangbo, huanglian, huangqin, shanzhi, dahuang, and chishizhi. If it is severe, add a little ice powder as a fine powder mixed with wine or duck broth for application; or the herbal powder &quot;zhendan&quot; is also effective.<br><strong>Frostbite</strong><a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Winter Month</strong></p>
<p>In the winter month, when the body touches the cold, the blood congeals and wounds arise. The body remains numb, unaware of pain or itch. Internally, take Shengma Heqi Decoction and eliminate Da Huang; externally, apply powdered incense wood, betel nut, sulfur, Wuyu, turmeric, and musk mixed with sesame oil.<br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Criteria</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scalds and Burns</strong></p>
<p>For scalds and burns, when exposed to fire, although extremely painful, if one endures for a moment, the pain will cease. Be cautious of applying cold items or mud from the bottom of a well, as this will trap heat and cause decay into the flesh.  </p>
<p><strong>Cracked Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>In the autumn and winter, the wind is cold and dry, causing cracks in the hands and feet. This results from insufficient blood and weakened skin, making them easily harmed. Apply emollient ointments externally and take internal medicines that nourish qi and blood.<br><strong>Authentic Surgical Text</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scalds and Burns</strong></p>
<p>Scalds from hot liquids are generally due to external causes with no internal condition. They can arise from extreme heat causing internal toxicity, or external cold injuries forcing toxins inward. For external skin damage and ulceration, apply cool ointment or millet husk ointment. If internal toxins manifest as irritability, dry mouth, and constipation, take Four Shun Qing Liang Decoction. If blisters burst, apply Pearl Powder for self-healing.  </p>
<p><strong>Frostbite</strong></p>
<p>Frostbite occurs when the muscles are extremely cold, causing qi and blood flow to stagnate—referred to as muscle death. Initially, it may present as purple spots, which, if prolonged, can turn black, rot, and produce pus. In such cases,apply Biyu Ointment to promote skin regeneration and closure of the wound.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>Lacquer Rash</h3>
<p>Lacquer rash arises from an external source and is a result of感, or sensitivity. Commonly, it is believed to be caused by contact with wood, which is a misconception. Lacquer itself is a hot, toxic substance; therefore, when it comes into contact with human skin, especially where the pores are not tightly closed, the poison can enter, causing itching. Scratching further aggravates the condition, resembling a skin rash that spreads across the body, leading to broken skin, discharge, and pain. In severe cases, it can cause alternating chills and fever. It is advisable to apply a mixture of leeks’ juice and Sanbai powder and to take a decoction of Detox Herbal Soup. One should avoid bathing in hot water and be cautious with spicy food. If not, it may lead to stubborn skin conditions that often recur.</p>
<h3>Scald and Burn</h3>
<p>Inadvertently, a person may suffer injuries from scalding water or fire, causing severe skin damage as if they were on the brink of death. I possess an internal treatment method that can restore life from death. The formula is called &quot;Chasing Fire Pill,&quot; which includes five qian (a measurement) of rhubarb and honey licorice, four taels of angelica, three qian each of fried schizoephedra, baicalein, and fangfeng, and three taels each of astragalus and poria. After decocting and consuming it, the pain will decrease by half after the first dose, be completely alleviated after the second, and the wounds will be fully healed after the third dose. This truly is a sacred and miraculous formula. Its brilliance lies in the heavy use of rhubarb in conjunction with astragalus and angelica, which both replenish qi and blood while expelling fire toxins. Particularly noteworthy is the use of schizoephedra and fangfeng to promote astragalus and angelica&#39;s abilities to restore qi and blood, facilitating recovery from stagnation. Furthermore, incorporating three taels of poria allows excess heat to dissipate through the bladder, alleviating skin pain. The roles of honey licorice and baicalein are primarily to harmonize and cool.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Frostbite</p>
<p>Frostbite occurs when a person cannot endure the cold, causing the skin to perish from freezing. When exposed to warmth, it results in frostbite. If frostbite occurs on the ear, and one attempts to warm it with their hand, it can worsen into an open sore. A remedy involves the use of yellow dog feces, which, if left exposed to the air for some time, turns white. This can be processed by burning it with charcoal to create a powder, then mixed in equal parts with aged lime and sesame oil to form a paste. Even if it has already become sore and ulcerated, applying this will relieve pain and promote healing; it is an exceptional remedy. However, if frostbite occurs on the ears or face without resulting in sores, this medicine is unnecessary. Instead, simply wash with a decoction of schizonepeta for three days, and it will heal. For the sores on the back, which are also skin ailments, a simple remedy involves grinding together one qian of finely powdered gypsum, three qian of radish seeds, half a fen of ice, and fourteen peeled and pointed almonds, applying this paste to the sores. It will heal in just one day. Its efficacy is remarkable and unparalleled.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Formula</strong>  </p>

<p>For treating burns and relieving pain while regenerating skin, one liang of powdered rhubarb lightly fried, combined with one liang of powdered angelica, can be mixed with candle oil or sesame oil for application; dry mixing is also acceptable.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Poppy Ointment: Used for treating burns from hot soup or fire, with damaged and rotten skin, causing pain, heat, blistering, or leakage. Take four liang of sesame oil and fifteen poppy flowers (use shells if no flowers are available), soak and fry until dry, then strain the oil. Pour the oil into a ladle, add three qian of white wax, and melt it down. Pour it into a jar, and when it starts to congeal at the edges, add two qian of fine True Light Powder and mix well. Cool in water and remove. When using, break the blisters, warm the ointment in the palm of your hand, apply to the affected area, cover with soft paper, and change twice daily; the pain will cease. The next day, use soft silk to clean off the dead skin, and reapply; it will heal itself.</p>

<p>According to the &quot;Treasured Mirror of Hygiene&quot;: Cold sores that discharge fluid are commonly known as frostbite. Some may take years to heal. For these, take clean, dried soil from wild fields, grind it with garlic into a thick paste, and form patties of the thickness of large coins, adjusting to the size of the sore. Apply these patties to the sore and moxibust them until they dry. Replace the dry patties with wet ones for moxibustion, regardless of how many times, until the scab feels painful and itchy, indicating that the sore can be treated. Then rinse the mouth with broth, take twenty chicken feathers, bind them into a brush, and clean the sore gently. This washing method prevents damage to the muscle. Use soft cloth to dry and apply a mixture of wood fragrance and betel nut powder. Treatment is even more effective in summer.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot;: For red and swollen frostbite on the heel, take the area just behind the heel where the flesh is red and white, and insert a needle three tenths deep; draw blood and apply moxibustion three to seven times. If the heel frostbite breaks, wash with green onion and pepper soup, scrape off the necrotic tissue, and use a three-edged needle to draw blood. Mix horse oil with raw cow bone marrow and apply it for effect.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Medical Case</p>
<p>In the &quot;History of the Yuan Dynasty,&quot; it is said about Hao Jing: his courtesy name was Bochang, and his ancestors were from Luzhou, later moving to Lingchuan in Zezhou. His family had a long tradition of being scholars; his grandfather, Tianting Yuanyou, had studied under him. At the end of the Jin dynasty, his father, Siwen, fled to Lushan in Henan. When chaos broke out in Henan, residents hid in caves, and the chaotic soldiers burned them, causing many deaths. Jing&#39;s mother also died. To save her, Jing mixed honey with cold vegetable juice and gave it to her to drink, which brought her back to life. At that time, Jing was only nine years old, and everyone was astonished by this.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>&quot;The Ruminations of the Confucian Family on Serving Parents&quot; states: A servant girl of the Dweller exhibited frostbite, commonly known as chilblains. The Dweller ordered her to take pills and a purging solution, and her sores consequently healed. Some questioned this, and the Dweller replied: &#39;When heart fire decreases, cold dissipates; what is there to doubt?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The Ten Books of Li Gao&quot; recounts: An elderly man, while traveling, stayed at an inn near a solitary tree north of Fangcheng. He had difficulty pushing a small cart, with his skin cracked and extremely painful, his hands unable to grasp the yoke, and his feet unable to touch the ground. After applying a soothing ointment he had on the cart, he found relief and was able to continue his journey the next day. This treatment was effective each time thereafter.</p>
<p>&quot;Case Studies by Xue Ji&quot; records: A man suffered from a burn on his arm during the Mengdong season, accompanied by pain, wheezing, and fever. This was a sign of fire toxicity impairing the lungs and metal, treated with a ginseng formula to pacify the lungs, which relieved the wheezing. However, due to fatigue, he then developed chills and fever, a sign of qi and blood deficiency, treated with Eight Treasure Decoction plus root of Platycodon and Angelica. Afterward, adding three fen of cinnamon to enhance the effect warmed the qi and blood, aiding in the healing of necrotic flesh.</p>
<p>The son of the Feng family suffered from fire sores and hastily applied cooling medicines, which led to abdominal distension and lack of appetite. I prescribed a ginseng formula to dispel toxins with addition of Akebia and gardenia, while externally applying a ground mixture of fried cypress leaves and sesame oil, resulting in gradual improvement. Previously, I had used boiled cypress juice combined with floating fat and vermilion for topical application, which proved even more effective. Using cooling medicines could force the fire toxicity inside, often leading to dire consequences.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>A man was injured on his leg due to a burn from hot soup while drunk, resulting in ulceration and heat, causing thirst for water. His pulse was strong and rapid. This was an issue of fire toxin. I used more than ten doses of fresh Rehmannia, Angelica, Scutellaria, Forsythia, Akebia, Kudzu root, and Licorice, and the various symptoms gradually receded. However, due to exhaustion, he suddenly experienced chills and fever. This was because of deficiency in Qi and blood, so I continued with ginseng and Astragalus, adding Schisandra and sour jujube seeds for stabilization. After more than a month, the ulcers healed.</p>
<p>A man suffered burns on both arms with intense pain and had difficulty with urination and defecation. The fire toxin had spread to the lower body. I prescribed a dose combining fresh Rehmannia, Angelica, Peony, Coptis, Akebia, Gardenia, Red Poria, and Licorice, and both urination and defecation improved, with pain alleviated. I then used Siwu decoction with ginseng, Astragalus, Licorice, and White Atractylodes to remove necrotic tissue, and after several doses, new flesh began to grow.</p>
<p>A woman had a severe burn on her chest that had not healed for two months. Her pulse was large and rapid but weak, with irritability and heat that increased in the afternoon. This indicated a deficiency in Yin blood, allowing fire toxin to cause trouble. I used Siwu decoction with Chai Hu and Moutan to cool the heat, and when the heat receded and she felt cooler, I also applied Xiao Yao San with dried tangerine peel to nourish the Yin blood and strengthen the spleen and stomach. The rotten flesh was eliminated, and new flesh grew.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Discussion of Vital Energy Communicating with Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Excessive sweating leads to exhaustion, causing a person to become weak. Sweating while damp results in the emergence of acne. Dietary changes leading to rich foods can cause severe boils. If one is exhausted as if holding back energy, laboring under the wind, or subjected to cold, it can result in skin rashes or acne.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The terms &quot;rashes&quot; and &quot;acne&quot; refer to mild symptoms of blood stagnation at the skin surface, indicating that the yang energy, which protects the skin, is weakened by evil influences, causing the thinning of blood in the skin and resulting in illness. Thus, it is stated that excessive sweating leads to exhaustion, which makes one weak, meaning that vital energy should be as widespread as heaven and the sun over the land. The emergence of acne and rashes implies that the protective yang energy exists between the skin and hair. Dietary changes leading to rich food indicate that the vitality must circulate through the pores.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Heat Sores and Prickly Heat</strong><br>Whenever heat sores arise, they produce white pus, which is commonly known as purulent sores today. Initially, they are shallow and only emit yellow liquid; this is called fatty sores, also known as yellow rotten sores. They first appear similar to fatty sores, are prone to contact with hands and feet, often appearing in pairs, and may wax and wane with the months, causing pain and itching, cracking. They can occur in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Those that worsen are called quenching sores.</p>

<p><strong>Acne</strong></p>
<p>In the summer heat, if the heart and mind become distressed and irritable, and the heat leads to sweating and dampness, sores will appear all over the body, sometimes with pus and blood, red and inflamed like fire. Use one qian each of nux vomica, pinellia, coptis, and coptis chinensis, and five fen each of gallnut and yellow powder, ground into a powder and applied dry. If itching increases, add burnt alum and realgar. Regularly taking coptis and donkey-hide gelatin pills can help clear internal heat. </p>
<p>When sores form from the heat and dampness of sweat, causing persistent itching and pain, use two qian each of astragalus, angelica, ledebouriella, and schizonepeta, along with ground brick powder (one liang). Boil these herbs in three large bowls of water until reduced to five or six bowls, then strain out the residue, slightly warm, and wash the affected areas. Dry them and avoid wind; it will be effective shortly. For mild cases, simply use wax snow water mixed with clam powder as a poultice.</p>
<p>Heat rash acne occurs due to excessive sweating and moisture. In mild cases, it appears like sprinkled millet. Wash with a decoction of sweet wormwood or the leaves of jujubes for relief. In severe cases of moist heat leading to numerous sores, use five qian each of mung bean and talc powder, applying it with cotton. If the sores are broken, add five qian each of coptis and jujube leaves, along with a bit of ground brain.</p>

<p><strong>Acne</strong></p>
<p>Acne is also known as a small abscess, commonly referred to as a hot abscess. Wang’s commentary states: it can be as large as a sour jujube or as small as a bean, red in color and containing pus and blood. According to Haizang, sweating and exposure to dampness can lead to acne and abscesses. Acne appears red and swollen, with pus and blood inside.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Acne</strong>  </p>
<p>Acne appears densely like scattered grains, sharp like thorny prickles, causing intense itching and pain all over the body. This is due to heat in the body being exposed to wind, causing the hair pores to close. It is advisable to take a wind-dispelling powder and wash with a bitter herb decoction. In severe cases, when skin lesions form into sores, use a mixture of medicinal powder on soft silk fabric to dab the affected area.  </p>
<p><strong>Secret Manuscript of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatments for Skin Conditions</strong>  </p>
<p>Rash and sores occur due to heat injury from summer. Washing with snow water is more effective; wash until the rash diminishes. If this is not available, an excellent remedy is to cut cucumber into slices and rub them on the skin, which will lead to healing. This is a method of treating skin and fur conditions.  </p>
<p><strong>Recipe</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Xuanfu Flower Pills</strong><br>Three taels of Xuanfu flower, half a tael each of Fangfeng, Baizhi, Gande Flower, Nanshing, Banxia, Shigao, Chuanxiong, Chenpi, and Baifuzhu, three qian each of Scorpion&#39;s tail and fried silkworm. Grind finely, mix with ginger juice to form pills the size of a Wutong seed, and take three to fifty pills with ginger tea after meals.  </p>
<p><strong>Pus-filled Sores Recipe</strong> - primarily for heat.<br>Three qian each of Huangqin, Huanglian, and Dahuang; two qian each of Shechuangzi and Hanshuishi; five fen of Huangdan; one qian of Baifan; a small amount of Qingfen, Baizhi, and unnamed herbs; a little Mu Xiang.

<p><strong>Initial onset of breast boils:</strong> Apply yellow adhesive mixed with concentrated vinegar for immediate relief.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Meaning of Grasses&quot; says: Huang Hongxuan suddenly developed a boil on his arm, swollen and without a head, causing extreme pain that was unbearable. All the external doctors claimed it was caused by hot toxins. However, considering his usual demeanor—detached, with a clear intention, and a calm heart—there was certainly no source of heat or toxic causes. Ultimately, he could not identify the origin of the issue. I suggested to respected Gong and Chang Shan that we set aside wine and food to consult a cook instead. Chang replied, “Let me first congratulate you on this condition, then I will speak of it.” </p>
<p>Every sore and ulcer arises for a reason. External causes include the toxic effects of the improper actions of heaven or the miasma from living and moving. Internal causes include the heat from rich wine and flavor, or the fire of pent-up anger. The treatment of fire toxins differs from that of other toxins; in essence, fire and original energy cannot coexist. By applying cold, the original energy will transform and flow. Consequently, Hongxuan found no reason here, and did not question the possibility of retained fetal toxins. </p>
<p>All humans receive the qi of heaven and earth, differing in purity. Those who are pure in essence are blessed with longevity without limits. However, since individuals are formed from the essence of their parents, it is unavoidable that they are mixed with the desire fire of their physical bodies. What is required is the action of smallpox, which expels the hidden desire fire from the body, restoring the pure essence to its constant form. This process is akin to refining ore; it is necessary to subject the ore to fire in order to separate the dross from the pure gold.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

When Hong Xuan was young, he had an excessive outbreak of smallpox, and his vital energy could not fully replenish. Additionally, he was hindered by other ailments. Although the fire and toxins in his organs were cleared, the remnants in his body persisted. Therefore, the eruptions of smallpox would inevitably appear in the joints of the hands and feet or the Crooked Pool, as minor toxins, unable to find suitable refuge, would hide in difficult-to-reach areas of respiration.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nowadays, the boils and carbuncles occur specifically at the points of the knee, and there is no doubt about the toxic nature of the pox. The poison lies beneath the elbows and armpits, originally causing no harm. However, the pure essence of the body has slight impurities, which are but subtle dust in a precious mirror or the minor flaw in a white jade. The sun, representing great harmony and vital energy, fills the body; it aims to expel the remnants from fifteen years ago, transforming them into pus and blood. Others see this as poison, but I have foreseen it as an opportunity for healing. Is it possible to be relaxed in the limbs without any manifestation in one’s endeavors?</p>
<p>The treatment involves externally using purslane to quickly break it apart, and internally employing the Baoyuan Decoction to thoroughly eliminate it. Additionally, applying the medicinal treatments used for pox will ensure recovery by the end of the day. It will certainly not resemble the prolonged agony of toxic sores. However, if one fails to recognize the signs and indiscriminately uses cold and draining treatments for sores, they only exacerbate the affliction. Who would say that minor ailments in surgery could be neglected without the intervention of a skilled practitioner? If treated according to this method, a significant amount of pus will be discharged; there is no need for regenerating flesh to heal on its own.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Burns and Similar Conditions</h3>
<p>For burns, one must be cautious not to wash with cold water. When a burn is exposed to cold, the heat penetrates deeper into the bones, making it difficult for the muscles and bones to heal. When first burned, one should quickly apply more heat from the fire; although it is very painful, enduring it will lead to relief after a while, which is remarkably effective. For treating burns, one should use fresh urine to drink cold, or mix cold water with honey to drink. If the mouth is closed, one must pry it open and then use various remedies to treat the condition.</p>
<h3>Frostbite</h3>
<p>The classics say: frostbite reveals clear fluid, commonly referred to as frostbite. If it does not heal for many years, use pure soil from the wild, dried in the sun, and grind garlic into a paste. Form it into cakes, sized according to the area of injury, thick as a large coin, and apply them to the wound. Then use moxa on the cake; the quantity is not fixed, just rely on the drying of the paste. After the cake dries, replace it with a wet cake for moxibustion, regardless of how many times, until the scab feels painful or itchy, indicating that the wound can be treated. Then, hold some damp starch in the mouth and wash the area using twenty strands of chicken feathers tied together as a brush. This method cleans the wound without damaging the flesh. Dry with soft cloth and apply a mixture of sandalwood and betel nut powder. It is especially effective if treated in summer.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Scald and Burn Sores</strong></p>
<p>For the symptoms of scald and burn sores, if there is fever and thirst, with red and turbid urine, use the Four Substances, Mountain Fragrant, Forsythia, and Licorice to nourish yin and blood to dispel toxins. If the affected area is not necrotic but painful, use the Four Noble Herbs, Chuanxiong, Angelica, Mountain Fragrant, Forsythia, and Licorice to strengthen the spleen and stomach to disperse toxins. If the affected area has necrotic tissue but is not ulcerated, use the Eight Treasures, Bai Zhi, and Licorice to tonify qi and blood to expel pus; if not effective, add cinnamon. If dead tissue has ulcerated and is not closing up, use the Four Noble Herbs, Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Astragalus to strengthen the spleen and stomach to promote tissue regeneration; if not effective, add roasted ginger. If a child suffers from this condition, or shows symptoms like eye rolling and head shaking, use the Four Noble Herbs with Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Mountain Fragrant to strengthen the spleen and stomach to clear liver heat. If symptoms appear after eating, or if there is abdominal distension and pain, use the Four Noble Herbs, Mountain Fragrant, Hawthorn, and Spirit Ferment to strengthen spleen qi for digestion. Generally, in the early stages of this condition, applying Effective Angelica Ointment can lead to spontaneous healing in mild cases, while severe cases may lead to necrosis and regeneration of healthy tissue. If the color is red, it indicates lingering fire toxins, and it is essential to apply until the area turns white. If the sores are located at joint flexures, applying this may hinder the formation of scabs and impede new tissue regeneration. If one suffers from death due to smoke inhalation, administering juice from radishes can revive them, as its spiciness helps disperse trapped qi.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the winter month, when the body touches the cold, the blood congeals and wounds arise. The body remains numb, unaware of pain or itch.

<p><strong>Cracked Hands and Feet</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scalds and Burns</strong></p>
<p>Scalds from hot liquids are generally due to external causes with no internal condition. They can arise from extreme heat causing internal toxicity, or external cold injuries forcing toxins inward. For external skin damage and ulceration, apply cool ointment or millet husk ointment. If internal toxins manifest as irritability, dry mouth, and constipation, take Four Shun Qing Liang Decoction. If blisters burst, apply Pearl Powder for self-healing.  </p>
<p><strong>Frostbite</strong></p>
<p>Frostbite occurs when the muscles are extremely cold, causing qi and blood flow to stagnate—referred to as muscle death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Lacquer Rash</h3>
<p>Lacquer rash arises from an external source and is a result of感, or sensitivity. Commonly, it is believed to be caused by contact with wood, which is a misconception. Lacquer itself is a hot, toxic substance; therefore, when it comes into contact with human skin, especially where the pores are not tightly closed, the poison can enter, causing itching. Scratching further aggravates the condition, resembling a skin rash that spreads across the body, leading to broken skin, discharge, and pain. In severe cases, it can cause alternating chills and fever. It is advisable to apply a mixture of leeks’ juice and Sanbai powder and to take a decoction of Detox Herbal Soup. One should avoid bathing in hot water and be cautious with spicy food. If not, it may lead to stubborn skin conditions that often recur.</p>
<h3>Scald and Burn</h3>
<p>Inadvertently, a person may suffer injuries from scalding water or fire, causing severe skin damage as if they were on the brink of death. I possess an internal treatment method that can restore life from death. The formula is called &quot;Chasing Fire Pill,&quot; which includes five qian (a measurement) of rhubarb and honey licorice, four taels of angelica, three qian each of fried schizoephedra, baicalein, and fangfeng, and three taels each of astragalus and poria. After decocting and consuming it, the pain will decrease by half after the first dose, be completely alleviated after the second, and the wounds will be fully healed after the third dose. This truly is a sacred and miraculous formula. Its brilliance lies in the heavy use of rhubarb in conjunction with astragalus and angelica, which both replenish qi and blood while expelling fire toxins. Particularly noteworthy is the use of schizoephedra and fangfeng to promote astragalus and angelica&#39;s abilities to restore qi and blood, facilitating recovery from stagnation. Furthermore, incorporating three taels of poria allows excess heat to dissipate through the bladder, alleviating skin pain. The roles of honey licorice and baicalein are primarily to harmonize and cool.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>Frostbite occurs when a person cannot endure the cold, causing the skin to perish from freezing. When exposed to warmth, it results in frostbite. If frostbite occurs on the ear, and one attempts to warm it with their hand, it can worsen into an open sore. A remedy involves the use of yellow dog feces, which, if left exposed to the air for some time, turns white. This can be processed by burning it with charcoal to create a powder, then mixed in equal parts with aged lime and sesame oil to form a paste. Even if it has already become sore and ulcerated, applying this will relieve pain and promote healing; it is an exceptional remedy. However, if frostbite occurs on the ears or face without resulting in sores, this medicine is unnecessary. Instead, simply wash with a decoction of schizonepeta for three days, and it will heal. For the sores on the back, which are also skin ailments, a simple remedy involves grinding together one qian of finely powdered gypsum, three qian of radish seeds, half a fen of ice, and fourteen peeled and pointed almonds, applying this paste to the sores. It will heal in just one day. Its efficacy is remarkable and unparalleled.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For chronic sores from lacquer, crush lacquer grass and apply it to the affected area for immediate effect.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Treasured Mirror of Hygiene&quot;: Cold sores that discharge fluid are commonly known as frostbite. Some may take years to heal. For these, take clean, dried soil from wild fields, grind it with garlic into a thick paste, and form patties of the thickness of large coins, adjusting to the size of the sore. Apply these patties to the sore and moxibust them until they dry. Replace the dry patties with wet ones for moxibustion, regardless of how many times, until the scab feels painful and itchy, indicating that the sore can be treated. Then rinse the mouth with broth, take twenty chicken feathers, bind them into a brush, and clean the sore gently. This washing method prevents damage to the muscle. Use soft cloth to dry and apply a mixture of wood fragrance and betel nut powder. Treatment is even more effective in summer.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot;: For red and swollen frostbite on the heel, take the area just behind the heel where the flesh is red and white, and insert a needle three tenths deep; draw blood and apply moxibustion three to seven times. If the heel frostbite breaks, wash with green onion and pepper soup, scrape off the necrotic tissue, and use a three-edged needle to draw blood. Mix horse oil with raw cow bone marrow and apply it for effect.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《元史》郝经传曰：经字伯常，其先潞州人，徙泽州之陵川，家世业儒，祖天挺元裕尝从之学。金末，父思温避地河南之鲁山，河南乱，居民匿窖中，乱兵以火熏灼之，民多死。经母许亦死，经以蜜和寒葅汁决母齿饮之，即苏。时经九岁，人皆异之。<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>In the &quot;History of the Yuan Dynasty,&quot; it is said about Hao Jing: his courtesy name was Bochang, and his ancestors were from Luzhou, later moving to Lingchuan in Zezhou. His family had a long tradition of being scholars; his grandfather, Tianting Yuanyou, had studied under him. At the end of the Jin dynasty, his father, Siwen, fled to Lushan in Henan. When chaos broke out in Henan, residents hid in caves, and the chaotic soldiers burned them, causing many deaths. Jing&#39;s mother also died. To save her, Jing mixed honey with cold vegetable juice and gave it to her to drink, which brought her back to life. At that time, Jing was only nine years old, and everyone was astonished by this.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Ruminations of the Confucian Family on Serving Parents&quot; states: A servant girl of the Dweller exhibited frostbite, commonly known as chilblains. The Dweller ordered her to take pills and a purging solution, and her sores consequently healed. Some questioned this, and the Dweller replied: &#39;When heart fire decreases, cold dissipates; what is there to doubt?&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The Ten Books of Li Gao&quot; recounts: An elderly man, while traveling, stayed at an inn near a solitary tree north of Fangcheng. He had difficulty pushing a small cart, with his skin cracked and extremely painful, his hands unable to grasp the yoke, and his feet unable to touch the ground. After applying a soothing ointment he had on the cart, he found relief and was able to continue his journey the next day. This treatment was effective each time thereafter.</p>
<p>&quot;Case Studies by Xue Ji&quot; records: A man suffered from a burn on his arm during the Mengdong season, accompanied by pain, wheezing, and fever. This was a sign of fire toxicity impairing the lungs and metal, treated with a ginseng formula to pacify the lungs, which relieved the wheezing. However, due to fatigue, he then developed chills and fever, a sign of qi and blood deficiency, treated with Eight Treasure Decoction plus root of Platycodon and Angelica. Afterward, adding three fen of cinnamon to enhance the effect warmed the qi and blood, aiding in the healing of necrotic flesh.</p>
<p>The son of the Feng family suffered from fire sores and hastily applied cooling medicines, which led to abdominal distension and lack of appetite. I prescribed a ginseng formula to dispel toxins with addition of Akebia and gardenia, while externally applying a ground mixture of fried cypress leaves and sesame oil, resulting in gradual improvement. Previously, I had used boiled cypress juice combined with floating fat and vermilion for topical application, which proved even more effective. Using cooling medicines could force the fire toxicity inside, often leading to dire consequences.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man was injured on his leg due to a burn from hot soup while drunk, resulting in ulceration and heat, causing thirst for water. His pulse was strong and rapid. This was an issue of fire toxin. I used more than ten doses of fresh Rehmannia, Angelica, Scutellaria, Forsythia, Akebia, Kudzu root, and Licorice, and the various symptoms gradually receded. However, due to exhaustion, he suddenly experienced chills and fever. This was because of deficiency in Qi and blood, so I continued with ginseng and Astragalus, adding Schisandra and sour jujube seeds for stabilization. After more than a month, the ulcers healed.</p>
<p>A man suffered burns on both arms with intense pain and had difficulty with urination and defecation. The fire toxin had spread to the lower body. I prescribed a dose combining fresh Rehmannia, Angelica, Peony, Coptis, Akebia, Gardenia, Red Poria, and Licorice, and both urination and defecation improved, with pain alleviated. I then used Siwu decoction with ginseng, Astragalus, Licorice, and White Atractylodes to remove necrotic tissue, and after several doses, new flesh began to grow.</p>
<p>A woman had a severe burn on her chest that had not healed for two months. Her pulse was large and rapid but weak, with irritability and heat that increased in the afternoon. This indicated a deficiency in Yin blood, allowing fire toxin to cause trouble. I used Siwu decoction with Chai Hu and Moutan to cool the heat, and when the heat receded and she felt cooler, I also applied Xiao Yao San with dried tangerine peel to nourish the Yin blood and strengthen the spleen and stomach. The rotten flesh was eliminated, and new flesh grew.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>
