      <div><p><strong>Complete Compilation of Ancient and Modern Books on Medicine, Volume 158</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tongue Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong><br>The south generates heat, heat generates fire, fire produces bitterness, bitterness produces the heart, and the heart governs the tongue, which is expressed in the orifice as the tongue. [Note: The heart&#39;s energy connects with the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, it can comprehend the five flavors, hence the tongue is the master of the heart. Additionally, the tongue is an organ of the heart, thus the heart&#39;s orifice is in the tongue.]</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion on Essential Diagnosis</strong><br>The terminal condition of Jueyin: internal heat leads to a dry throat, difficulty in urination, and a troubled heart; in severe cases, the tongue curls, and the testicles retract, leading to the end. [Note: The liver corresponds to the sinews, the sinews gather in the Yin organ; thus the tongue curls and the testicles retract.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong><br>In summer, the damaging winds affecting Bing and Ding are identified as Heart Wind. The symptoms of Heart Wind are excessive sweating, aversion to wind, scorching pain, and irritability that is red in color. In severe cases, speech is impeded, the diagnosis resides in the mouth, which appears red. [Note: The heart is a fire organ; when the wind is excessive, the fire becomes intense, hence the lips and mouth become scorched, and bodily fluids are depleted. The wind transforms wood, and the interaction of wood and fire becomes intense, causing irritability. The heart governs the tongue; in severe illness, the base of the tongue is strong, making speech difficult. When the heart is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five flavors, thus the diagnosis is in the mouth.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Subtle Pulses</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The pulse of the heart is strong and lengthy; when there is illness, the tongue will curl and be unable to speak.<br>(Note: A strong and lengthy pulse indicates vigorous and prolonged heartbeat; this manifests from excessive heart fire, hence the tongue curls. The heart governs speech, and thus one cannot speak.)</p>
<p>For lung heat diseases, one first experiences a shivery sensation, the hair rising, and a dislike of wind and cold; the tongue appears yellow and the body feels warm.<br>(Note: The skin and hair relate to the lungs; internal heat causes chilly sensations externally, leading to a dislike of wind and cold. Severe heat results in cold symptoms. The lungs connect to the throat, so the tongue appears yellow.)</p>
<p>At the time of rising brightness, the tongue is its master.<br>(Note: Rising brightness relates to the governance of fire; fire pertains to the heart, which opens through the tongue.)</p>
<p>The extreme Yang governs heaven, susceptible to the invasion of wind; the people experience robust tongues. The qi of the governing heaven is overcome by wind, balanced by spicy and cool remedies, aided by bitter and sweet, and calmed with sweet treatments, with sour ones used to purge.<br>(Note: The extreme Yang governs heaven in the year of Yi Hai. Illustrations from the meridian texts show tongue robustness as a sign of spleen issues, where windy wood overcomes the body, originating from spleen disorders, thus balancing is needed to harmonize upward and move downwards.) The extreme Yang governs, which can lead to chest and flank pain, and the tongue becomes difficult to use.<br>(Note: If there is governance leading to chest and flank pain, it is due to the liver meridian extending through those areas. The extreme Yang and lesser Yang govern the tendons, and when affected, the tongue curls, making it hard to speak.)<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Spiritual Pivot:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Channels and Vessels Section</strong></p>
<p>The spleen channel of the foot Taiyin ascends through the diaphragm, flanking the throat, connecting to the root of the tongue, and spreading beneath the tongue. When it is in motion, it causes discomfort at the root of the tongue; when eating, it leads to vomiting, stomach pain, abdominal distension with frequent belching. After eating, when gas is released, there is a feeling of relief as if one is recovering from fatigue, but the body feels heavy. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;root of the tongue&quot; refers to the base of the tongue. Symptoms like discomfort at the root of the tongue and vomiting during meals are illnesses caused by the spleen channel. Frequent belching signifies that the spleen qi ascends to the heart. The feeling of relief after gas is released signifies a reversal of qi dispersing up and down. The heaviness of the body indicates the counterflow of Taiyin qi.]</p>
<p>The kidney channel of the foot Shaoyin runs alongside the throat and flanks the root of the tongue. It governs ailments related to the kidneys, leading to symptoms of a hot mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat, shortness of breath, dryness and pain in the throat, anxiety, and heart pain. </p>
<p>[Note: The kidneys govern essence. Hence, ailments arising from the kidneys prevent essence fluids from nourishing, resulting in a hot mouth, dry tongue, throat pain, anxiety, and other symptoms, as water does not rise to nurture, causing fire to become excessive.]</p>
<p>When the foot Jueyin qi is exhausted, the tendons become weak. The Jueyin refers to the liver channel; the liver is where the tendons converge; tendons are gathered in the genital area and connect at the root of the tongue.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Therefore, when the pulse does not nourish, the tendons become tense; when the tendons are tense, they pull the tongue and the testicles. Thus, if the lips turn blue, the tongue rolls, and the testicles shrink, it indicates that the tendons have died first. The death of Geng and the profound death of Xin indicate that metal overcomes wood.</p>
<p>[Note: The energy of the foot Jueyin governs the tendons, hence when the energy is cut off, the tendons also become severed. Jueyin refers to the liver meridian, and the liver is associated with the tendons, indicating that the energy of Jueyin connects to the liver meridian, and the energy of the liver corresponds to the tendons. That which accumulates in the yin organs is the assembly of tendon energy at the root tendon. When the tendons gather in the yin organs and are connected to the base of the tongue, thus if the pulse does not nourish the tendons, they become tense, and the tongue rolls and the testicles shrink. When Jueyin energy is severed, the tendons die first. The death of Geng and the profound death of Xin signify that metal overcomes wood, leading to the exhaustion of the wood energy of the liver.]</p>
<p>The hand shaoyin, also known as Tongli, is one and a half inches away from the wrist; it separates and ascends, following the meridian into the heart, connecting to the base of the tongue and linking to the eyes. When it is functional, it supports the diaphragm; when deficient, it cannot articulate.</p>
<p>[Note: The hand shaoyin&#39;s channel is connected with the meridian, named Tongli in between. It is one and a half inches away from the wrist, separates from the meridian, ascends, and follows the meridian into the heart, linking to the base of the tongue and connecting to the eyes. When it is full, it supports the diaphragm without obstruction; when deficient, it cannot speak, for the heart governs speech and the channel connects to the base of the tongue.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Classical Chinese Text Translation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The foot Taiyin&#39;s primary channel connects at the base of the tongue.<br>The foot Taiyin&#39;s primary channel passes through the center of the tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Tendons</strong></p>
<p>The foot Taiyang&#39;s tendon branches enter and connect at the base of the tongue.<br>The hand Shaoyang&#39;s tendon branches curve towards the cheek and connect at the base of the tongue; the condition is characterized by a rolled tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Fluids</strong></p>
<p>The foot Taiyin&#39;s primary channel rises to the hip, converges with Yangming, and ascends together, connecting at the throat and passing through the center of the tongue.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Five Readings and Five Uses</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is the organ of the heart.<br>(Note: The heart opens through the tongue, hence the tongue is considered the organ of the heart.)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse and Measurement</strong></p>
<p>The spleen&#39;s qi connects to the mouth; when the spleen is harmonious, the mouth can discern the five grains. The heart&#39;s qi connects to the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, the tongue can recognize the five flavors.<br>(Note: The mouth can distinguish the five grains, and the tongue can identify the five flavors. When the heart and spleen are harmonized, both the mouth and tongue will be in balance, thus the five grains and five flavors can be recognized upon entering.)</p>
<p><strong>Nourishing and Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The upper jiao arises from the mouth above the stomach, extending above the throat, penetrating the diaphragm and spreading throughout the chest. It traverses the armpits, follows the pathway of the greater yin, and returns to yangming, rising to the tongue and descending to the lower yangming.<br>(Note: The upper jiao that emerges from above the stomach is its connected deployment, extending above the throat, passing through the diaphragm, spreading through the chest, exiting under the armpits, following the pathway of the greater yin, moving back to the yangming’s celestial cauldron, rising to the tongue and then descending to the lower yangming region.)</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The marker of the foot’s lesser yin is located at the back point and the two vessels below the tongue. The marker of the foot’s greater yin is at the back point and the root of the tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Unspoken Distress and Anger</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is the mechanism of sound.<br>The lesser yin of the foot is connected to the tongue, linking to the transverse bone, and culminating at the epiglottis.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Oral Inquiry Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What energy causes a person to bite their tongue? Qi Bo replied: This is due to the reversed movement upwards; the pulse energy arrives in succession. When the Lesser Yin energy arrives, it causes tongue biting; when the Lesser Yang energy arrives, it causes cheek biting; when the Yang Ming energy arrives, it causes lip biting. Examine the patient to provide nourishment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: The teeth are born of kidney energy. The pulse of the Lesser Yin lies at the root of the tongue, while the pulse of the Lesser Yang runs along the cheeks. Just as the energy from the kidneys rises due to reverse movement, it converges with the pulse energy generated from the middle jiao, resulting in tongue biting.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intestines and Stomach Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The tongue weighs ten taels, measures seven inches in length, and two and a half inches in width.</p>
<p>** Essentials of the Golden Coffer [Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji]**</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>When the patient has abdominal distention, if pressing it does not cause pain, it indicates deficiency; if it causes pain, it indicates excess and can be purged. The tongue appears yellow; if it is not purged, the yellow will naturally dissipate. Abdominal distention, with a wilted yellow tongue and restlessness that prevents sleep, pertains to the yellow family.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Enters the Organs and is Difficult to Speak of</strong></p>
<p>The pulse at the inch position is floating and tight; tightness indicates cold, while floating indicates deficiency. When cold and deficiency clash, the evil resides in the skin. If the pulse is floating, it suggests blood deficiency, and the collateral vessels are empty; the invader does not disperse, either left or right. If the evil energy becomes sluggish, the righteous energy quickens. The righteous energy draws the evil, making it difficult to flow smoothly. If the evil is in the collaterals, the skin lacks sensation. If the evil is in the channels, the weight is unbearable. If the evil enters the bowels, one becomes unrecognizable. If the evil enters the organs, it causes difficulties in speech and leads to salivation.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Cold in the liver causes inability to lift the arms, a dry tongue, a tendency to sigh, chest pain that cannot be alleviated by changing positions, and vomiting along with sweating after eating. Abdominal fullness and dry mouth and tongue indicate water qi in the intestines, treated with the formula of Jiao Li Huang Yuan. For thirst disease, craving water, and a dry mouth and tongue, it is treated with Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang. If a patient experiences fullness in the chest and swollen lips, a blue tongue and dry mouth, desiring only to rinse with water but not to swallow, with no chills or fever, a weak and delayed pulse, and a non-distended abdomen, the person may feel full due to blood stasis.</p>
<p><strong>On Cold Damage</strong> 【Han Zhang Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Dryness</strong></p>
<p>For Taiyang disease, excessive sweating followed by purging, resulting in no bowel movement for five or six days, a dry tongue and thirst, and slight fever in the afternoon, with fullness and pain in the chest and hypogastrium that is tender to touch, it is treated with Da Xian Zhong Tang. In cases of cold damage with either vomiting or purging, if after seven to eight days there is no resolution, indicating heat accumulation inside, both surface and interior are hot, with periodic aversion to wind, extreme thirst, dryness on the tongue and irritability, desiring to drink several liters of water, it is treated with Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>White Coating</strong></p>
<p>For Yangming disease, if there is fullness beneath the ribs, no bowel movement, and vomiting with a white coating on the tongue, one may administer Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. When the upper burner is unblocked, the fluids descend, and the stomach qi harmonizes, the body will then sweat lightly and ease the condition. If the illness resembles chest binding and the appetite is normal with occasional diarrhea, while the cun pulse is floating and the guan pulse is small, thin, and tight, it is termed &#39;Zang Jie&#39; (Organ Binding). If the white coating on the tongue is slippery, it is difficult to treat. If Zang Jie presents without yang symptoms, showing no alternation of cold and heat, and the person remains still with a slippery tongue coating, it should not be attacked.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue Treatise</strong></p>
<p>The tongue reflects the heart and the status of the small intestine. A tongue weighs ten ounces, measures seven inches in length, and two and a half inches in width. It is adept at assessing and can balance the five flavors. When eating, if one consumes too much salt, the tongue pulse becomes congealed and discolored; too much bitterness leads to a dry appearance of the tongue&#39;s surface; too much spiciness causes the tongue muscles to tighten and the edges to become dry; too much sourness makes the tongue flesh swell and the lips reveal; too much sweetness results in pain at the root of the tongue and loss of its outer surface. It is noted that the heart desires bitterness, the lungs desire spiciness, the liver desires sourness, the spleen desires sweetness, and the kidneys desire salt—these five flavors correspond to the qi of the five organs. If the organs are heated, the tongue develops sores, and the lips are revealed and red; if the bowels are cold, the tongue&#39;s base retracts, and the mouth is tight with blue lips. Cold should be supplemented, heat should be drained; when neither cold nor heat is present, adjustments should be made based on the organs. If the tongue retracts and the mouth is tight with blue lips, Sheng Ma Decoction is the proper treatment.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers</strong> 【Jin - Dou Hanqing】</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If the tongue is hard like that of a pangolin, the external signs exhibit aversion to cold and strong heat, with speech being hindered and sluggish; this indicates that the heart has endured heat. The heart is the root of the tongue; the disease arises from the heart. The treatment method involves using a small knife to prick the purple-black areas and decocting medicine with more gardenia fruit added. Gardenia is essential for clearing heat.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If a small tongue grows underneath, its color bright red, with the external sign of swelling and a hard nodule below the chin; this indicates that the heart suffers from heat, and toxic energy emerges under the tongue. First, use purple snow powder to help release hot saliva; urgently consume sweet tangerine with added ginger and light heart in decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Palate</strong></p>
<p>If a sore forms on the tongue resembling a bayberry, with no signs of cold or heat but causing frustration; first use sweet tangerine soup with added gardenia, followed by administering the Coptis detoxifying soup, and then apply ice powder incense; it is inadvisable to use a knife.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue Sore</strong></p>
<p>If a sore appears on the tongue like a yellow chestnut, with an external sign of aversion to cold and open mouth; first use clam water, or freshwater snail water, or bitter tea to cleanse, then apply medicine; afterward, take a mouse glue detoxifying soup with added gardenia and Coptis. If there is bad breath, blow in ice powder medicine, adding borneol, burnt alunite, copper green, and powdered Coptis.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p>

<p>Beneath the tongue are three small sub-tongues, resembling the shape of a lotus flower. However, the tongue is also a sprout of the heart. When the heart fire rises, it may result from excessive thinking, being harmed by fire, or taking cool air after drinking, which leads to wind-phlegm clashing and forming. For this condition, it is urgently advised to use a cooling detoxifying decoction with adjustments, and additionally apply powdered borneol. If swelling does not subside, it is advisable to use a small knife or needle to release purple blood.</p>
<h3>Fetal Color</h3>
<p>The tongue is the official of the heart and should correspond to the southern direction. Fire is inherently red and moist. After three to four days of cold damage, a membrane may appear on the tongue, white and slippery like that of a fetus. In severe cases, it may be dry, or have a yellow or black appearance, indicating varying depths of heat. If the evil qi is on the surface, the tongue will not show a membrane. However, when the evil qi penetrates inward and bodily fluids become obstructed, a membrane will form on the tongue. When cold evil first invades, the heat may not yet be fully formed, which may present as either a partial exterior or interior condition, or if the evil qi resides in the chest, the tongue will show a white and slippery membrane. The classics say: &quot;A tongue that appears like a fetus indicates heat in the elixir field and cold in the chest, signifying the initial invasion of evil qi into the interior.&quot; In cases of Yangming disease with fullness under the ribs, constipation leading to vomiting, a white membranous tongue indicates that evil qi remains at the half surface and half interior. If Yangming disease is treated with purging, this may leave the stomach void, causing external qi to disturb the diaphragm, resulting in agitation in the heart. In such cases, a membranous tongue calls for the use of gardenia and fermented soy extract soup, indicating that evil qi resides in the chest.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If there are dirty blockages that can be purged, and the tongue has a smooth coating, it is said that one should not attack, as the evil is not yet fully formed and the heat is still accompanied by cold. When the evil transforms into heat, the coating on the tongue becomes dry and rough. The classics state: If a febrile illness does not resolve after seven or eight days, it indicates that heat is locked inside, with both exterior and interior presenting heat, accompanied by intermittent chills, severe thirst, and a dry, vexed tongue, with a desire to drink several liters of water, the remedy is Baihu Jiajinshen Decoction. This heat depletes body fluids, and the smoothness has already dried up. If heat accumulates in the stomach, the tongue will turn yellow, indicating that the heat has penetrated deeply. The &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot; states: If the tongue is yellow and yet remains untreated, purging will cause the yellow to disappear. If the tongue is black, it indicates extreme heat. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: In heat illnesses, a dry mouth and a black tongue lead to death. The heart is regarded as the monarch, opening its orifices in the tongue. Black corresponds to the color of the kidney, reflected in the heart region. The heart symbolizes fire, while the kidney symbolizes water. When the evil heat reaches its extreme, it is a dire condition, indicating certain death. Observing the tongue and mouth also reveals the state of disorder or harmony within.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Approach to Filial Piety</strong>  【Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng】</p>
<p><strong>On Tongue Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Heat manifests under the tongue, resulting in a small growth known as &quot;child tongue swelling&quot;; when heat is present within the tongue, the tongue becomes swollen, referred to as &quot;wooden tongue swelling.&quot; The term &quot;wood&quot; implies strength without gentleness. Minor cases can be softened, while severe cases require a pungent remedy. Once, I treated a woman with wooden tongue swelling; her tongue filled her mouth, and various medicines did not help. I used a small, sharp needle to puncture it, and after five to seven punctures, the swelling reduced. It took three days for the swelling to fully subside, with the blood loss amounting to nearly a bucket.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Writings of Dongyuan</strong>  【Yuan Dynasty, Li Gao】</p>
<p><strong>On Tongue Pain</strong></p>
<p>If the tongue feels dry and prickly like a bayberry thorn, slice fresh ginger into thick pieces, dip it in honey, and rub it on the tongue. The discomfort will vanish immediately, proving to be effective.</p>
<p><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Methods</strong>  【Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng**</p>
<p><strong>On Swelling</strong></p>
<p>A wooden tongue refers to a tongue that is swollen, hard, and lacks softness. Use powdered herb frost, mirabilite, and talc as a mixture and apply it with wine. For various types of tongue swelling, take half a coin’s worth of dragon brain powder, dip a finger in, and rub the medicine on the tongue, both above and below, and swallow saliva down.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>Sores on the Tongue</h3>
<p>Sores on the tongue are caused by heat and obstruction in the upper body. It is advisable to use the Holy Decoction or Sweet Tangerine Decoction with ten qian of Scutellaria, and mix in Willow Flower Powder, or apply white lotus petals.</p>
<h3>The Tongue and the Five Tastes</h3>
<p>The heart&#39;s energy connects to the tongue, enabling it to discern the five tastes; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the mouth, allowing it to recognize the flavors of the five grains.</p>
<h3>Tongue Disorders</h3>
<p>The tongue is the organ of the heart, responsible for tasting the five flavors and distributing them to the five organs. The heart&#39;s main vessel is connected to the root of the tongue, while the spleen&#39;s network connects to the sides of the tongue. The liver&#39;s vessels circulate through the tongue&#39;s base, and the kidneys&#39; fluids come out at the tongue&#39;s tip, distributing to the five organs, under the heart&#39;s control. If the three meridians are affected by the four Qi, the tongue may curl and be unable to speak; if the seven emotions are stagnant, the tongue may swell and be unable to articulate. For instance, if heat in the heart causes the tongue to ulcerate, obstruction in the liver may lead to bleeding like a surge, and blockage in the spleen may cause a white coating reminiscent of snow. These are the disorders of the tongue. The heart&#39;s energy connects to the tongue, and harmony in the heart enables the discernment of five tastes; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the mouth, and harmony in the spleen allows for the recognition of the flavors of grains.</p>
<h3>Heavy Tongue</h3>
<p>For a heavy tongue, first rinse with cool water, then chew fresh peppermint leaves (five to seven leaves), followed by thoroughly chewing a piece of the Holy Golden Essence until it is extremely fine, then swallow with well water. In severe cases, take three doses continuously, and place a piece directly on the affected area; the illness will dissipate along with the medicine.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Tongue Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>If the tongue is rotten at its base and heat persists, it is a sign of rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br>In the past, there were cases of ulcerated sores on the tongue that developed into cavities over time, and repeated use of cooling agents was ineffective. Eventually, the administration of Heixi Dan led to gradual recovery. This condition stems from deficiency below, thus leading to excess above. Additionally, if there is external swelling of the tongue, it is referred to as &quot;heavy tongue,&quot; treated with a powder of true Puhuang. There are also cases where the tongue is inexplicably numb, which should not be treated as wind; instead, it is due to insufficient heart blood and can be addressed with a modified Lizhong Decoction by adding half a qian of熟附子 (prepared Aconite) and half a qian of Angelica.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br>The connection of the five organs to the tongue is as follows: the heart&#39;s primary vessels are attached at the root of the tongue, the spleen&#39;s collateral vessels are connected to the sides of the tongue, the liver&#39;s vessels run along the yin organs and connect at the base of the tongue, and the kidney’s fluids emerge at the tip of the tongue, distributing moisture to the five organs, with the heart primarily governing this. Thus, it is said: all channels converge at the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Shortness and Rigidity of the Tongue</strong><br>In cases of sudden stroke, the tongue becomes short and rigid; if it curls and speech is lost, the patient may be near death. Generally, when there is wind, one uses the Xiao Xun Ming Decoction; for cold, the Lizhong Decoction; and for heat, a Sweet Tangerine Decoction with additional Fangfeng, Zhuhe, and Huangqin. If the tongue is stiff due to wind, cold, and dampness, use equal parts of alum and cinnamon powder to stabilize the tongue, or apply proper tongue medication. For a stiff tongue due to phlegm heat, which may also be swollen or shortened, use the Ganlu Drink.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If the swelling is due to emotional factors causing stagnation of Qi, use Jin Fei Cao San. If it does not heal after a long time, apply Hei Shen Wan externally with ancient frost salt. If caused by anger, apply rusted iron powder.</p>
<p>For a swollen tongue, making it hard to expel air, it is referred to as &quot;wood tongue.&quot; Use aged tea and aged white plum, combined with seven Bajiao beans, pound them into a paste, rinse the mouth with mint water, and as soon as it is possible to swallow, take one or two pieces and supplement with congee. If there are sores connected to swelling of the cheeks, use Yuan Shen Sheng Ma Tang.</p>
<p>For a swollen tongue that cannot produce sound and impedes food intake, known as &quot;heavy tongue,&quot; continuously brush the tongue with catkins to help it reduce. If one cannot swallow medicine, take concentrated huanglian decoction and sip it frequently to clear heart fire.</p>
<p>If the tongue is swollen like a pig&#39;s bladder, pierce the large veins on both sides under the tongue; when the blood flows out, the swelling will subside. Be careful not to pierce the veins themselves, which could cause continuous bleeding. Cauterize with a copper chopstick heated by fire; if bleeding does not stop, it could be fatal. Alternatively, mix vinegar with charcoal and apply it to both sides of the tongue; remove and reapply until it naturally subsides. If one refuses to eat, it could also be fatal.</p>
<p>If the tongue is swollen and there are insects underneath resembling cricket or silkworm, small white head with a tail, it can be cauterized with hot iron directly on the tongue to make it disappear.</p>
<p>If the tongue extends beyond an inch, apply powdered Bingshen (borax) to it.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Rupture</strong></p>
<p>Heart heat causes sores to rupture; use a simple Huanglian decoction. Spleen heat, accompanied by a dry, white tongue coating; use peppermint honey ice pill. For heart and spleen heat, use Shengma and Gegen decoction with additions of peppermint, Huangqin, and Jiegang.</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Color</strong></p>
<p>The tongue represents the heart&#39;s sprout, and the kidneys govern bodily fluids. When healthy, the tongue is red and moist; occasional red spots on the tongue indicate impending yellowing. If there is evildoing heat in the lower abdomen, the heart&#39;s sprout becomes withered, leading to a pale appearance akin to a white fetus. Thus, when evil is on the surface, there is no fetus; when it first penetrates inward, the fetus is pale and slippery. If there are symptoms of cold and heat in the stomach, use Zhizhi decoction to expel it. For Yangming disease with a hard side, constipation, and vomiting, where the tongue coating is white, do not forcefully purge; use Xiao Chaihu decoction to harmonize. If there is aversion to cold and the desire to vomit phlegm, add dried ginger to Xiao Chaihu. A slippery white fetus with diarrhea indicates internal stagnation, which should not be treated. As heat deepens, the fetus becomes white and dry; if heat deeply enters the stomach, the fetus becomes yellow, either plump and shiny or sharply white with a yellow root, suggesting an external excess with internal deficiency. Both require Baihu decoction with ginseng. Sweating in the hands, feet, and underarms, irregular speech, constipation, and a fetus appearing purple or black, or presenting with spikes or insect-like dry cracks, should be treated with Chengqi decoction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>There are several types of black tongues. A tongue that is red at the edges and gray-black in the center indicates a loss of fluids. A tongue with a black ring signifies unresolved pathogens. A tongue with a black tip indicates internal distress. If the tongue shows yellow with black in the middle and either a black tip or irregular black spots, it indicates deep heat toxicity. A tongue with red stripes and a black center, or black spots within a white coating, suggests unresolved exterior pathogens. A tongue with a black root and a yellow tip, accompanied by a slippery pulse, may indicate that it can be purged; if the pulse is floating, it can indicate sweating. A tongue that is sharply black with irregular lines and a slippery yet solid pulse requires urgent purging. If the pulse is rapid and weak, there will surely be thirst leading to death. </p>
<p>In general, regardless of the degree of blackness, a black tongue all indicates a dangerous condition. Only if it is cold and slippery, resembling a pale black, does it signify rootless false heat, which can be treated with medicines to transform phlegm and reduce heat. </p>
<p>For conditions of yin with a white coating on the tongue and abdominal pain with diarrhea, use the Li Zhong Tang. If there is dampness resulting in bi syndrome and the tongue resembles a coating, it is not genuine. For heat in the lower abdomen and cold in the stomach, use Wu Ling San. </p>
<p>If there is an external wind-cold invading the channels, the tongue coating may be white, yellow, and black; this is a sign of death.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Tongue Related to Heart and Spleen</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is associated with the heart and spleen. The classics say: the heart governs the tongue. It is also stated: in organs it is the heart, in orifices it is the tongue. Furthermore, it is said: the heart&#39;s energy flows to the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five tastes. Thus, the tongue is related to the heart. Additionally, the central area is yellow, connected to the spleen, opening at the mouth, and storing essence in the spleen, hence diseases at the base of the tongue are related to the spleen.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Tongue</strong></p>
<p>A small structure resembling the tongue that grows under the root of the tongue is called a heavy tongue; if it is attached inside the cheek or to the hard palate, it is called a heavy palate; if it is attached above the gums, it is called a heavy gum. All these should be pricked, and blood can be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>A wooden tongue refers to a tongue that is swollen, thick, and gradually hardens, filling the mouth. If not treated promptly, it may lead to death. The method is to use two qian of purple snow, mixed with bamboo juice, to frequently apply in the mouth to resolve the condition.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Oral and Pharyngeal Issues</strong> </p>
<p>It is said: the tongue is a seed of the heart. This is expressed through obscure words. Speaking partially, each of the five organs has its corresponding aspect; when discussing in depth, each organ has its own master. For instance, if there is swelling and pain in the mouth and tongue, or if it appears as if there is no skin, or if there are symptoms of fever and thirst, this indicates a deficiency of central energy with heat. If the eyes appear smoky, the body feels fatigued with little appetite, or if symptoms worsen in the afternoon, this points to deficiency of yin and blood with heat. If there is throat pain, tongue sores, dry mouth, and significant heat in the feet, during the day it worsens, this indicates deficiency fire in the kidney channel. If the limbs feel cold and there is aversion to eating, or if phlegm is heavy and eyes are red, this suggests decline of fire at the gate of life. If there is fever and thirst, drinking cold beverages leads to constipation, this is indicative of excess fire in the spleen and stomach. If there is fever and chills, dry mouth and thirst, little food intake, and fatigue, this indicates deficiency heat in the spleen channel. If the tongue root is strong and there is swelling and pain in the cheeks and jaw, this signifies damp heat in the spleen channel. If phlegm is abundant causing thirst, with swelling and pain in the mouth and tongue, this shows heat in the upper burner. If there are excessive thoughts leading to sores in the mouth and tongue, and discomfort in the throat, this reflects injury to the blood of the spleen channel causing fire to stir. If there is excessive anger, with a bitter feeling in the mouth and swollen tongue, this indicates injury to the blood of the liver channel causing fire to stir. The causes of disease are numerous, requiring appropriate responses based on the time. In cases of severe tongue swelling, it is advisable to first prick the tip of the tongue, or the top or sides, to cause bleeding and release toxins, thus alleviating the urgency. However, for the sublingual area of the kidney channel, while it may be beneficial to release blood, acupuncture should be avoided.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Verification of Tongue Examination</strong></p>
<p><strong>White Coated Tongue</strong><br>Upon observation, if the tongue appears white and slippery, it indicates that pathogens have just begun to enter the interior.

<p><strong>Tongue Classification</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Belonging to the Tongue</strong><br>It is related to the Hand Shaoyin Heart Meridian.<br><strong>[Note: The Suwen states: The heart connects to the tongue; it fears cold. The Nei Jing states: The heart qi communicates with the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, the tongue can recognize the five flavors. In illness, the tongue may retract and shorten, with redness in the cheeks, its pulse strong and long. Qiao Yue states: When the heart fails, the tongue cannot retract and cannot speak.]</strong><br>It also pertains to the Foot Taiyin Spleen Meridian.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Li Dongyuan said: The tongue is associated with the heart; it also knows taste, which indicates that the tongue contains elements of the spleen. In the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it is said that the foot Taiyin connects to the middle of the tongue. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: The center is yellow, which corresponds to the spleen, hence ailments at the root of the tongue. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; also mentions that the foot Taiyin, when active, causes tongue root stiffness, and illnesses arising will result in pain at the tongue root. Additionally, if the sublingual pulse is excessively needled, bleeding may occur, leading to muteness. The sublingual pulse is the spleen pulse; muteness refers to the inability to speak. Furthermore, Sun Jingsi stated: The tongue is governed by the heart’s qi and is connected to the spleen pulse. If the two organs are imbalanced, wind pathogens can invade, causing the tongue to stiffen and hinder speech, while phlegm heat attacks, leading to swelling and the inability to articulate. There are also symptoms such as heavy tongue, stiff tongue, tongue swelling, and bleeding, all resulting from the invasion of wind and heat on the heart and spleen channels. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is also associated with the foot Yangming stomach meridian. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Zhang Jifeng stated: The spleen and stomach govern the four limbs, their pulses connecting to the root of the tongue and linking to the lips and mouth. The stomach is the sea of fluids, the spleen processes and digests them, whereby the essence of these fluids transforms into nutrient defenses to nourish the four limbs. If one fails to maintain proper living habits or eats at irregular times, it leads to insufficient spleen and stomach qi, resulting in poor nourishment for defense, allowing wind pathogens to invade, causing paralysis of both the limbs and the lips, resulting in slurred speech. If untreated for a long time, it could develop into atrophy. The classics state that treating atrophy should focus on the Yangming system, namely the foot Yangming, and the treatment should emphasize the use of spleen and stomach remedies while minimizing medications to dispel wind for stability. </p>
<p>Additionally, it also belongs to the foot Shaoyin kidney meridian.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm Bag</strong></p>
<p>The phlegm bag is caused by phlegm and fluid rising with heat, condensing under the tongue, forming a soft, swollen mass similar to a gourd, which affects speech and causes pain and discomfort. It should be cut open with sharp scissors, allowing the yellow phlegm to flow out, which resembles thick, sticky egg white that is hard to break. After draining, apply ice-boron powder externally and internally take Erchen Decoction with added Huangqin, Huanglian, and Bohe over several doses while avoiding fried foods, strong alcohol, and similar items.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Tongue</strong></p>
<p>In both adults and children, a heavy tongue is caused by the chaotic action of heart fire. One should prick the affected area with a needle to let out toxic blood and take a detoxifying decoction to clear the heart internally. Externally, apply ice-boron powder.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p>
<h3>Wood Tongue</h3>
<p>Purple tongue, wood tongue, also arise from heart fire. Use a little flying salt and borneol, apply diligently, and saliva will flow, leading to healing. If phlegm accumulates on the tongue, causing a painful lump, and it is hard and stiff, use a thread needle to prick and draw blood, then apply ice borax powder.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Tongue Diseases</h3>
<p>According to the &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot;: A scholar returned home at night while his wife was asleep. He shook her, and when she asked what was the matter, he did not respond. He shook her again, and she looked at him in surprise, only to find her tongue swollen and filling her mouth, unable to speak. They urgently sought a doctor, who arrived carrying a pouch of medicine and mixed it for her, and by morning she had returned to her original condition. When asked, he revealed it was cattail pollen. Kun comments that &quot;The inner canon&quot; states: Excess heat causes swelling. This condition must arise from the combined fire of the heart and spleen affecting the tongue, causing swelling and filling the mouth. Cattail pollen is cold in nature and can clear qi and cool the blood, hence it cured her. </p>
<p>In cases of heat syndrome, there is often protrusion of the tongue. When one recovers yet the tongue cannot retract, use a bit of borneol, grind it into powder, and apply it to the tongue, and then it can retract. The reason for the tongue&#39;s protrusion is that heat is truly present inside, and it seeks to expel the tongue to release qi; the reason it cannot retract is that the pathogenic qi has long been lodged, making the tongue stiff and not pliable. Borneol is spicy and warming but has a clear fragrance, which can open the orifices, soften the tendons, and release qi. Thus, with its application, the tongue retracts. There are instances of swollen tongues that extend outward where no one dares to treat them.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>A villager said: Occasionally there is this medicine; I returned home to fetch it, and found it to be two pieces of paper twisted into wicks. I burned them with a lamp to let the smoke waft over my tongue, and it immediately reduced the swelling. When others inquired about the method, the villager replied: In my family, there was an old cow whose tongue also became swollen and protruded. People taught to use castor oil to soak the paper wicks, burn them, and let the smoke treat it, which proved effective. </p>
<p>Kun remarked: When the tongue is swollen and protruding, it is said that heat overwhelms and causes the swelling. The tongue is the seed of the heart, and the spleen&#39;s meridians are connected to the root of the tongue. Thus, the heat should be attributed to the heart and spleen meridians. The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: Castor oil is effective for edema and eliminating foul gas; applying oil based on the leaves can alleviate wind swelling and numbness when pounded and steamed for application, which shows it can relieve internal heat from wind swelling. </p>
<p>However, the use of its smoke has a subtle meaning: smoke is a light and clear substance; once it enters the mouth, it can be transmitted and transformed through breathing, allowing it to reach directly to the heart and spleen. It not only addresses the symptoms but can also treat the root cause. The villager used it without understanding the principle; that is why he remains a villager. If a physician hears of it and fails to discern its reasoning, he is also merely a villager!<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>On Fetal Color</strong></p>
<p>A black tongue in a fetus, although said to indicate fiery symptoms, can actually result from both true and false heat. When addressing this condition, one should primarily observe the pulse to distinguish between true and false, and then use color differentiation as a secondary tool to avoid mistakes. Generally, true heat causing blackness will also show signs of red, purple, dry mouth, or several prickling sensations; if the black is deep with little red and is smooth, it does not indicate true heat. Conversely, if the six pulses are thin and weak, accompanied by a feeling of fatigue and depletion, this indicates a state of deficiency, suggesting that cold water is obstructing the heart&#39;s fire and not returning to its original state. Merely treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause guarantees an unsuccessful treatment. </p>
<p>The treatment method: If the heat within is not severe and there’s still some unresolved exterior issue, one should use drinks like Chai Hu decoctions to resolve the exterior; if the internal heat is quite severe, use remedies like Liang Ge San or Xijiao Dihuang Tang to clear the interior. This is the method for treating true heat.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>If there is yin deficiency and excessive fire, accompanied by unresolved exterior pathogens, it is appropriate to use yin tonics and qi-boosting decoctions that address both exterior and interior. If both the form and qi are deficient, with cold water invading the heart and the empty yang not consolidating, one must use formulas like Li Yin Decoction, Li Zhong Decoction, or Great Nourishing Yuan Decoction to single-mindedly support the interior, which can safeguard against danger; this is the method to treat empty fire.</p>
<p>If the tongue has a white coating and speech is slurred, one should use mint and white honey combined with ginger slices to apply and rub onto it. The tongue is the organ of the heart, normally red and moist. After three or four days of cold damage, if the tongue has a coating, it will inevitably turn from moist to dry, from slippery to rough, from white to yellow, from yellow to black, and even scorched dry, or develop pricking sensations; all these are signs of evil heat transmitting from the superficial to the deeper layers. Therefore, when the pathogenic qi is in the exterior, the tongue will not have a coating; when it transmits to the interior, the fluids become dry, leading to tongue coating formation. </p>
<p>If the pathogenic influence is still not deep, existing between the exterior and interior, or if the pathogenic qi is lodged in the chest, the coating will not be black or rough, and one should only use formulas like Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to harmonize it. If the yang pathogens penetrate the interior, causing heat in the stomach, the tongue coating will be rough rather than slippery, necessitating formulas such as Zhi Zi Chi Decoction to clear it. If there is restlessness and a desire to drink large amounts of water, one should use White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng and similar formulas to address it.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Generally, a yellow coating on the tongue that is scorched indicates the presence of pathogenic heat in the stomach and intestines. It may be treated either by clearing it or by mildly purging. The &quot;Essentials from the Golden Coffer&quot; states: if the tongue is yellow but not purged, then purging will cause the yellow to disappear on its own. However, one must ensure that the stool is dry and firm, the pulse is deep, strong, and there is great thirst to consider purging. If there is only slight thirst, the pulse is weak, the stool is not hard, and the coating is not dry and prickly, purging is not appropriate. </p>
<p>If the tongue has a black coating with prickles, the heat is even more intense, and it is advisable to use cooling medicines such as Liangge Powder, Chengqi Decoction, or Da-Chaihu Decoction accordingly. If the coating is black and slippery but not scorched, it indicates an absence of real pathogenic factors and is not a sign of fire; in this case, purging or attempting to clear it would not only be inappropriate but also harmful. </p>
<p>This is a general differentiation based on the tongue, and while it is stated this way, there are still cases that do not fit neatly into these categories; therefore, careful examination is recommended as discussed below. </p>
<p>It is noted in various treatises on febrile diseases that the heart is the sovereign organ, opening to the tongue. The heart governs fire, and the kidney governs water; black, being the color of water, appearing in the heart region indicates a conflict leading to death. Although this is a logical assertion, there are exceptions to it.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The Five Elements interact and restrain each other; it is inevitable that there will be overcoming, and this is why sickness arises. Is it because of overcoming that one must die? We must examine the root of the condition carefully. If there is black color touching the ground and looking gray and dull, its source is already ruined, and death is certain. However, if the tongue appears scorched and black but the texture is red and lively, it is not necessarily a sign of death. When yang energy is strong, it clears the stomach fire; if the fire recedes, healing will occur, so there is no need for concern! If there is great loss of vital energy and only yin pathogens are present, the color will also be yellow-black. If true water has dried up, the tongue will be dry and scorched as well. When both water and fire in the kidneys are deficient, it is not a sign of real heat. To discern this, one must observe the shape, energy, pulse, and color; the distinctions between deficiency and excess will become apparent, guiding one to tonify or clear accordingly, much like the difference between ice and fire. Therefore, anything that is scorched, dry, and withered may not indicate real heat or fire. Furthermore, if someone appears dark and lacking vitality but moist and not dry, it indicates that water is overcoming fire, which is a sign of deficiency-cold. Mistaking this for fire and administering bitter cold remedies would extinguish what little remains. Thus, for all such conditions, one must thoroughly investigate the pulse and symptoms, prioritizing deficiency and excess, rather than hastily concluding that the blackened appearance solely signifies clearing out heat! This applies to typhoid fever, and all other conditions similarly.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Swollen and Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Swollen and wooden tongue: It swells beneath the tongue and resembles the tongue itself, hence called swollen tongue, also referred to as &quot;child&#39;s tongue.&quot; When it suddenly swells and becomes hard like wood, it is called wooden tongue; both conditions arise from heat and obstruction in the upper burner. The best method is to use a needle to prick and remove the blood, along with taking internal remedies to clear the stomach and reduce fire for recovery. If the tongue suddenly swells like a pig&#39;s bladder or becomes as hard as wood or stone, rendering speech impossible and causing fullness that blocks the mouth, it can be life-threatening. One should check beneath the tongue for signs resembling a mole cricket or a silkworm. In such urgent cases, blood should be pricked from the swollen area, and then a mixture of coal from the bottom of a pot with salt and vinegar should be thickly applied, or well water can be used to prepare a paste for application as well. After removal, reapply. If the condition is not severe, just using this application can lead to recovery.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Stone Chamber Secret Manuscript</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Tuduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sore in the Mouth</strong></p>
<p>A sore unexpectedly appears on the tongue inside the mouth, extending outward by an inch, forming a yellow scab on the surface. It makes eating difficult, and people believe the illness is in the heart, attributing it to internal heat causing this sore. This is indeed a common understanding, but it is not entirely accurate. There are also malevolent forces that may be involved. </p>
<p>A proper method is to take a small amount of borneol, place it inside a clam shell, and it will immediately dissolve into water. Then, a goose feather should be used to apply it on the sore; it can quickly be absorbed into the tongue, enabling eating and drinking again. The clam is an extremely Yin substance, so it attacks Yin-related evils, causing them to retreat. Furthermore, the pungent warmth of borneol helps drive out evils vigorously, ensuring success with little effort. </p>
<p>Sores on the tongue signify the presence of heat from the heart, and since the tongue is associated with the heart, it’s first seen as a connection. The method involves using three grams of Scutellaria (huanglian) and one gram of Acorus (changpu), boiled in water and taken as a single dose for recovery; this is a divine formula.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The effectiveness of this formula lies not in the Huanglian, but in the Changpu. Changpu specifically targets the heart channel, while Huanglian, though it also enters the heart, necessarily involves the liver and spleen as well, which is not as focused as Changpu’s sole targeting of the heart. Moreover, by not mixing in herbs from various channels, but rather advancing with a singular purpose, there can be no doubt about its efficacy! This is why the results are as immediate as the sound of a drum.</p>
<p>If one does not understand the strategic use of herbs and lightly mixes them with liver and spleen remedies, although there may still be some effect, it will ultimately not be as quick as a drumbeat. This is how one treats heat.</p>
<p>For those suffering from sores on the tongue and mouth, it indicates heat in the heart channel, and one should use cooling herbs like Huanglian and Huangqin to promote self-healing. Currently, if one utilizes one qian each of Huangbo and Jiangcan, and half a qian each of burnt Zhiqiao, roasted licorice, mint, and Shandougen, ground into a fine powder, mixed with three li of Bingshu, and taken three times a day, improvement will be noticeable on the first day, with complete healing by the next day.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Black</strong></p>
<p>Cold and directly affects the kidney meridian; the tongue is black, the eyes are closed, the lower body is entirely black, the upper body is entirely blue. With feces expelled and urine retained, this is a very urgent condition. Although there are heavenly remedies, it is feared that complete recovery is difficult. However, I am determined to save lives, thus I have formulated a prescription. While I can&#39;t say that everyone can be saved, perhaps one or two out of ten may be rescued. The prescription is called &quot;Heart Rescue Decoction.&quot; Ingredients: five taels of ginseng, one piece of aconite, half a jin of atracylodes, one tael of cinnamon, five fen of calamus, three qian of ginger. Boil in water and take it as a decoction. This prescription uses more ginseng and atracylodes; if used too little, the power may not be sufficient to control the heat of cinnamon and aconite. Thus, it must be increased to hope for clarity throughout the body and to completely expel the cold toxins. If bowel movements are stopped and urine retention occurs, there is a chance of life returning. After taking another dose, if the eyes open and the black tongue clears, both the black and blue conditions can be resolved. If after taking the medicine, the problem of incontinence continues, there is no need to take more medicine; one should simply await death. Generally, this prescription can save about three or four out of ten patients suffering from this illness.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Severe Heat Condition</strong></p>
<p>When a person has extreme internal heat, the tongue appears like a thorn, the lips and mouth crack, and there is intense thirst with calls for drink. Even if this condition does not present the symptoms of typhoid, the affected person, despite not having a fever, is not far from death. Bai Hu Decoction can also be effective, but it is excessively cooling, which may harm the stomach qi. Often, the heat may diminish but transform into something more serious, leading to death; therefore, Bai Hu Decoction should not be used lightly. </p>
<p>I have a prescription called Qingliang San: two liang of Yuan Shen, one liang of Mai Dong, five qian each of Gan Ju Hua and Qing Hao, and three qian each of Bai Jie Zi, Sheng Di, and Che Qian Zi, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is notable because Yuan Shen is the main ingredient, resolving the flames of the upper jiao; Mai Dong serves as the minister, alleviating heat in the lungs; Gan Ju and Qing Hao act as assistants to extinguish fire in the stomach. Particularly effective are Che Qian Zi, Bai Jie, and Sheng Di, which either transform phlegm or cool the blood, directing excessive heat downward from the bladder. Thus, the body maintains a balance of cooling while dissipating heat without harming the stomach, making it able to support those in crisis without risking transformation into a more severe condition.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p>
<h3>Dryness and Cracking</h3>
<p>After the loss of blood, if the mouth and tongue are dry and cracked, making it impossible to eat or drink, death will ensue. This is because the loss of blood naturally leads to a lack of blood to produce essence; when essence is depleted, fluids are also depleted, which is an inevitable consequence. To restore moisture to the dry mouth and tongue, it is necessary to rejuvenate the depleted essence and blood. The Six Flavor Pill is the best method to replenish essence; however, it only supplements the essence in the kidneys and cannot nourish the fluids of the mouth and tongue. Although supplementing the kidneys can also facilitate the upper fluids, it still feels inadequate in urgent situations. </p>
<p>I now propose a remarkable formula that supplements both the upper and lower parts, named the &quot;Mutual Nourishment Decoction&quot;. It consists of 1 liang each of prepared Rehmannia and Ophiopogon, and 5 qian each of Cornelian cherry, Adenophora, Angelica, Achyranthes, and Polygala, along with 3 qian each of Ginseng and thyme, 2 qian of Chinese schisandra, and 1 qian of Plantago seeds, decocted in water for administration. This formula primarily supplements the kidneys while also including herbs that nourish the lungs, so that both aspects support each other. It moistens from above and below, leading to the generation of essence and fluids, and hence the generation of blood and fluid. How can one not celebrate the possibility of revival even in critical conditions?<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Dryness manifests as a dry and swollen tongue, with blood in the urine and continuous blood in the stool, which indicates a fatal condition. This results from the poisonous heat of summer, which becomes extreme in autumn, preventing the lung&#39;s metal from purifying and regulating. Consequently, both urine and stool become extremely hot and lead to blood. According to theory, upon seeing blood, one should treat it; however, treating the blood causes it to not cease, adding to the dryness and rendering it hopeless. Therefore, I do not treat the blood directly but focus on alleviating the dryness, using a formula called &quot;Jianrun Pills.&quot; The ingredients are one tael each of cooked Rehmannia, Angelica, and white peony, two taels each of Scrophularia, Ophiopogon, and Adenophora, five qian each of Plantago and fresh Rehmannia, and three qian of Chinese rhubarb, all decocted in water. One dose is light, two doses can stop the bleeding, thus bringing hope for recovery. This formula is purely excellent for nourishing the blood, using Chinese rhubarb to clear heat and Plantago to facilitate water flow. With the heat cleared and water facilitated, treating the blood is unnecessary, as it will resolve itself.</p>
<p><strong>Protruding Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If a person&#39;s tongue is protruding and refuses to retract, it is due to excessive yang fire. Applying a small amount of borneol can help retract it. Later, administer three qian each of Coptis, ginseng, and white peony, and one qian each of sweet flag and bupleurum, decocted in water; two doses should suffice.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Contraction of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>When a person&#39;s tongue retracts into the throat and they are unable to speak, it is due to cold energy obstructing the chest and abdomen. One should urgently use three qian of ginseng, five qian of white atractylodes, and one qian each of cinnamon, aconite, and dried ginger to treat this, then the tongue will relax.</p>
<p><strong>Reattachment of a Severed Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If a person&#39;s tongue tip is bitten off or the root is severed, whether it has been one day, two days, or half a month, it can all be reattached. Quickly take a dog’s tongue and ensure its size and cut match the man&#39;s tongue. Have the patient sit in a chair, leaning back with their head against the chair, and hold their throat with their hand to extend the tongue. Dip the dog&#39;s tongue in medicinal powder and place it on the human tongue; once connected, it will not fall off. The medicinal powder recipe is as follows: three qian each of dragon teeth and ginseng, three fen of borneol, one qian of elephant skin, and three headless and wingless earth dogs, plus twenty earth lice. First, grind all items of ginseng into powder, then mash the earth lice and earth dogs into the preceding powder, mix well, and wear this powder on the body for three days. When dried, store it in a bottle. This medicinal powder is remarkably effective for such conditions. A broken bone will heal with one qian; this is a miraculous remedy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The one who is severed can be long again.</p>
<p>I have heard people say that one can regrow a lost tongue by rinsing it with vinegar; this claim is highly erroneous. When flesh encounters acidity, it contracts—how could it possibly stretch out again? Instead, one should use one tael of ginseng, decoct it into a broth, and rinse with it for half a day. After completing the rinse with the ginseng broth, take three fen each of dragon&#39;s teeth powder and blood-resorption powder, and one qian each of ginseng and wheat beards, along with two fen of borneol, one dog, and ten earth worms. Roast these ingredients to a powder, place them on the ground for a moment to release their heat, and when the ginseng rinse is completed, dip your tongue into this powder, spreading it thoroughly. Do not retract your tongue into your mouth immediately; instead, keep it outside for half a moment. Endure until you can no longer stand it before retracting it back in. Repeat this process three times, and the tongue will be extended.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Secret Methods for Diagnosing Fever Through the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>When the tongue has a white coat, it indicates that the evil heat is not severe; use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to resolve it. If the tongue is yellow, it indicates heart heat; one can use Huang Lian and Zhi Zi to cool it. If the tongue is yellow with a grayish hue, this indicates stomach heat; use Shi Gao and Zhi Mu to cool it. If the tongue is yellow with a reddish tint, this indicates heat in the small intestine and bladder; Zhi Zi can be used to clear it. When the tongue is red with a white coating, it indicates lung heat; Huang Qin and Su Ye can be used to resolve it. If the tongue is black with a reddish tint, it indicates kidney deficiency with evil; use Sheng Di and Yuan Shen, adding Chai Hu to harmonize it. A red tongue with black spots indicates extreme stomach heat; Shi Gao should be used to treat it; Yuan Shen and Gan Ge can also be used, but they are not as effective as Shi Gao. A red tongue with white points signifies the presence of evil in the heart; use Chai Hu and Huang Lian to resolve it, treating both the heart and liver. A red tongue with large red spots indicates stomach heat with dampness; Yin Chen Wu Ling San should be used to promote urination. Water dampness must return to the bladder to disperse the evil, and only cinnamon can draw it into the bladder, but only a small amount should be used, not too much. A tongue that is coated white with black spots also indicates stomach heat; Shi Gao should be used to cool it.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>If the tongue is yellow with black spots, this indicates excess heat in the liver channel. Use Chai Hu (Bupleurum) and Zhi Zi (Gardenia) to relieve it. If the tongue is white with yellow, this suggests that the pathogen is about to enter the interior; urgently use Chai Hu and Zhi Zi to prevent it from entering the interior, as Chai Hu is a medicine that works both on the exterior and interior and is essential. If the tongue is white in the middle and yellow on the outside, this indicates that the pathogen has entered the large intestine; one must use Wu Ling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) to disperse water. Once the water is dispelled, the diarrhea will stop. If the tongue is yellow in the middle and white on the outside, this shows the pathogen is internal rather than external, upper rather than lower; one should add Chai Hu and Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange) to harmonize and relieve it, and should not abruptly use Da Huang (Rhubarb) for a harsh purge. Tian Shui (Heavenly Water) added to Wu Ling is also acceptable, but it is always better to use Chai Hu and Zhi Ke to directly address the root of the illness; adding a little Tian Shui is more appropriate, or if Tian Shui is not used, Wu Ling San can also be utilized. If the root of the tongue is yellow and glossy white, this indicates heat in the stomach coupled with dampness; one must use Shi Gao (Gypsum) as the principal ingredient, along with a small amount of Tian Shui products, such as Zhu Ling (Polyporus) or Ze Xie (Alisma). If the tongue has yellow spots separated by white, this indicates that damp pathogens have entered the large intestine, and one should promptly use Da Huang and Yin Chen (Virgate Wormwood) to clear it out without needing to use Di Dang or Shi Zao Tang (Ten Jujube Decoction). If the purging is slow, it cannot be used. One must also distinguish between water and blood; use Shi Zao for water, and Di Dang for blood. If the tongue shows red spots like worm bites, this indicates that water has not risen while fire intrudes; one must also use Huang Lian (Coptis) and Chai Hu to harmonize and relieve it.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>If the tongue is red and裂 like a person’s character, it indicates that evil has just entered the heart; gypsum and yellow orchid should be used to resolve it. If the tongue has a black root and a pointed red tip, it indicates that evil in the kidney has not dissipated; Chai Hu and gardenia should be used to resolve it. If the tongue has a black root and a white tip, it indicates that stomach fire is affecting the kidney; gypsum, anemarrhena, and scrophularia should be used to resolve it, regardless of thirst or diarrhea. If the tongue has a black root and a yellow tip, evil is about to enter the kidney, and it is urgent to use rhubarb as a purgative. However, one must differentiate between painful and painless abdominal symptoms; if there is pain and the abdomen cannot be touched, it should be purged urgently, otherwise, only Chai Hu and gardenia should be used to harmonize and resolve it. If the tongue is uniformly red but the tip is black, it indicates kidney deficiency with evil fire invading; gypsum decoction should not be used. If the kidney is already deficient and gypsum is used, it leads to swift death. Instead, one should use one or two taels of scrophularia to save it, as many can survive. If the tongue shows a red center with pure black around the edges, it indicates the dual fires of the monarch and minister rising; urgent use of rhubarb with two portions of fresh earth should be administered to save it, and out of ten, five or six can be saved. If the tongue has a gray-black center with slightly red edges, this indicates evil has become lodged in the large intestine; purging will lead to recovery, while neglect will lead to death.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>If the kidney&#39;s essence is dried up and cannot be nourished, one should not use nourishing medicines such as cooked rehmannia at this time. This is because the pathogenic factors have not dispersed, and to replenish would only increase the distension and urgency, thus causing harm. It is essential to first expel the pathogens, after which one may use fresh rehmannia to nourish the kidney, but it should be used sparingly. If the tongue appears a pure gray with two black rings in the center, it indicates that the pathogen is about to invade the kidney. In that case, urgent use of a couple of burdock roots with a bit of bupleurum is required. If the tongue shows a red exterior but a black interior, this signifies extreme heat resembling water; one should urgently use bupleurum, gardenia, rhubarb, and bitter orange to harmonize and facilitate. If the tongue also has spikes, it indicates an extreme level of excessive heat, necessitating an increase in the aforementioned medicines. In general, if the interior is black and the exterior is white or yellow, those are similar signs and should be treated accordingly, allowing for a 50% chance of recovery. If the tongue is a light black with slight red or white on the exterior, or light yellow on the interior, this is a milder condition, and the previous methods can be applied, offering an 80% chance of recovery among ten individuals. If the tongue is purely red with a few black lines, this indicates water attacking fire, which is a yin syndrome; the tongue coating must be slippery, with aversions to cold and water, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Should a pure black tongue appear, that indicates a lethal condition, and no treatment is necessary. Water resembling fire and fire resembling water, both with a pure black hue, should not be treated. Understanding the symptoms as they relate to tongue diagnosis in typhoid allows one to navigate clinical cases more accurately and avoid missteps.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Formula for Shengma Decoction</strong><br>Treats heart heat, sores, and cracks on the tongue, leading to swollen and red lips.

<p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>When the tongue is covered with a white and smooth coating, rub it with fresh ginger dipped in honey, or wash it with ginger honey water. If the tongue coating is yellow, red, dry, or thick, take a new piece of blue cloth, wrap your finger, dip it in cold water, and rub it repeatedly. If it is mild, it can be easily removed; if severe, it is difficult to remove, and you must give a strong purge so that the fluids return and the coating will naturally retreat. </p>
<p>If there are sores on the tongue, or if the white coating is dry and thick like snow, affecting speech: mix equal parts of mint juice and white honey, blend and apply it. First, wash the tongue with thick slices of fresh ginger dipped in honey water, then apply the medication.</p>
<p>Another formula: wash with ginger honey water, then use a small amount of cinnabar, arsenic, borax, and musk powder mixed together and apply, which is also effective.</p>
<p>For treating the severed tongue: if an adult or child accidentally bites their tongue, severing it but leaving part still attached, use the soft skin of a chicken egg to wrap the tongue. Mix Xue Dan (blood-quickening) with honey and apply it to the root of the severed tongue. Then prepare a honey-wax mixture, adjusting the thickness as needed, and apply it on top of the chicken skin, as the softness helps the medicine penetrate. Keep applying it diligently; within three days, the tongue will reattach. After that, remove the chicken skin and continue applying the honey-wax mixture diligently for seven days until fully healed.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p>

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: the pulse of Changyang causes back pain, pain radiates to the chest, eyes appear dull, in severe cases, the tongue rolls and cannot speak, puncture the inner sinews at the two points near the inner ankle, in front of the large tendon, two inches above the ta Yin. Puncturing the foot Shaoyin pulse can lead to heavy bleeding, making the tongue difficult to speak. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: heat diseases must not be punctured; if the tongue is rotting and the heat does not cease, it leads to death. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: swelling under the tongue makes it hard to speak, if the tongue is crooked and not aligned, then treat it accordingly.<br>If the tongue is sluggish and there is excessive saliva, treat at the foot Shaoyin point.<br>For a heavy tongue, puncture the tongue root with a (gold needle).<br>If the mouth is cramped, there are missing teeth, pain in the lower jaw, cheek swelling with chills, inability to close the mouth, and the tongue cannot speak or chew, treat it at the large welcoming point. If the tongue is crooked with excessive saliva and there is restlessness, then treat at the Yin Jiao point.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The &quot;Thousand Gold Formulas&quot; states: If there is swelling under the tongue, the person cannot speak. If the swelling is in the Yin Valley, saliva flows out even if the tongue is extended. In the Wind Mansion, the tongue is slow and cannot speak; if it is quick, words are difficult to form. The points of Fu Tu, Da Zhong, and Qiao Yin cause bleeding at the base of the tongue. If there is yellow on the tongue tip, the body feels hot. The point of Chi Ze causes a dry tongue and flank pain. Guan Chong causes a curled tongue, dry mouth, and feelings of distress. Zhong Chong indicates pain at the base of the tongue. Tian Tu shows a blue pulse at the tongue seam. Fu Liu causes a curled tongue that cannot speak. </p>
<p>When the tongue swells and overflows with saliva, resembling a blown-up pig bladder, and breath cannot pass, if not treated promptly, it can be fatal. One must urgently scrape both sides of the tongue with a finger to release the fluid, which will lead to recovery. Alternatively, a heated metal knife can be used to cut the sides and then apply wound ointment. Another method is to puncture both major vessels beneath the tongue, careful not to hit the central vessel, as that will cause uncontrollable bleeding and can be fatal. If the above treatments do not work or if the blood loss is substantial, heat a metal comb until red and use it to cauterize the wound several times to stem the bleeding. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jisheng Formulas&quot; states: for a quick tongue, treat the mute gate; for a slow tongue, treat the Wind Mansion. The &quot;Three Causes Formulas&quot; notes that swollen tongues typically have a parasitic worm underneath, resembling a mole cricket or a sleeping silkworm, with a head and a tail, the head being somewhat white. Burning iron and cauterizing the head will help eliminate it.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The &quot;Ten Texts of Dongyuan&quot; states: The Lianquan point is also known as the &quot;root of the tongue,&quot; located beneath the jaw and above the throat. It treats conditions such as swelling under the tongue, difficulty in speaking, excessive saliva, locked mouth, urgent contraction of the root of the tongue, and difficulty swallowing food. The &quot;Discourse on Needle Techniques for Malaria&quot; mentions that the two vessels beneath the tongue refer to Lianquan. The &quot;Discourse on Forbidden Needles&quot; states that if one needles the vessels beneath the tongue excessively, the bleeding does not stop, leading to silence. The &quot;Discourse on Genuine Pathologies&quot; notes that blood will stop when taken from the Lianquan point, indicating that it is appropriate to draw blood and should avoid the use of a needle. </p>
<p>In response to the query about the two differing interpretations of where to needle the Lianquan point—one stating it is beneath the jaw and above the throat, while the other says it is at the two vessels beneath the tongue—what is correct? The answer is: The term &quot;root of the tongue&quot; refers to the base of the tongue. If one needles the two vessels beneath the tongue, they are targeting the tip of the tongue, which is incorrect. The correct location to needle is beneath the jaw, which corresponds to the root of the tongue. Furthermore, the pathway of the Foot Yangming channel has its roots in the Yingdui and concludes at Lianquan.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>Under the chin is where the Yangming channel operates. If one takes the two vessels under the tongue, they do not belong to the Yangming meridian. Wu and Gui combine, and Lianquan is associated with the foot Shaoyin, treating saliva below. It is explained that heat in the stomach overflows upwards, opening Lianquan, hence saliva must be discharged through bleeding to relieve the stomach heat. It is also understood that this does not refer to the two vessels under the tongue, as the swelling under the chin and above the throat is definitive. The &quot;Zhang Lun&quot; states that Lianquan and Yuye are the pathways of body fluids. According to the &quot;Needle Classic,&quot; Shaoyang is associated with Lianquan. Now, Yangming indicates diseases. The &quot;Effective Prescriptions&quot; states that if the tongue is swollen like a pig&#39;s bladder, one should use a needle to prick the large vessels on either side of the tongue; once blood flows out, it will immediately subside. Do not prick the central vessel, as bleeding that does not stop leads to death. If treating Yangming, use a heated copper chopstick to burn it, or apply vinegar mixed with herbal frost; it will quickly resolve.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>This affliction is often unrecognized by many; if left untreated, it can lead to death. The &quot;Compendium of Medical Science&quot; states: for treating ailments such as heavy tongue, wooden tongue, and purple tongue, which are characterized by swelling, pain, rigidity, and an inability to speak, along with swelling at the tongue root and where the tongue meets the teeth, leading to blockages and a difficulty in opening the mouth, one must use this method to puncture. Use a coarse cotton needle to prick at the tip of a chopstick, applying it to the affected area to draw blood. If the redness and purpleness are mild, it&#39;s less severe; if it&#39;s darker and blackish, it indicates a more serious condition. For severe cases, several dozens of pricks may be necessary until the blood is drawn out, then rinse with warm water. In more serious cases, a gold key may be used; for lighter cases, use ice borax powder applied to the affected area to remove excess heat and saliva. Internally, one may take cooling herbs or drinks, which can be chosen as needed. For a swollen tongue that makes speech difficult: take points such as Lian Quan, Jin Jin, and Yu Ye to induce bleeding. Also consider Tian Tu, Shao Shang, Ran Gu, and Feng Fu. For a curled tongue: take points like Ye Men and Er Jian.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The tongue extends and saliva flows downward: induce the Yin Valley.<br>When the tongue is swollen and difficult to speak, with sores in the mouth and saliva flowing from the tongue, and the root of the tongue rapidly retracts: apply moxibustion at Lianquan for three points, and when the qi is obtained, it will drain. For a swollen tongue: moxibustion at Lianquan for three points, and use three-edged needles at Jinjing and Yuye to draw blood; also target Tiantu and Shaoshang.<br>Another method: target Lianquan, Rangu, Fengfu, Tiantu, and Guanyuan.<br>Acupuncture at the rolled tongue, particularly selecting the Shaoyang meridian and tendon on the hand. The classics say: a pathogenic factor affects the Shaoyang meridian of the hand, causing constriction and rolling of the tongue, with a dry mouth and heart vexation, pain in the outside of the arm, and the hand not reaching the head; puncture the middle and ring fingernail tips, removing the tip like a chive leaf, each with one puncture. It also states: the tendon of the Yangming hand, its disease manifests as pain and cramps, with tongue rolling; treatment lies in burning needles and puncturing, using knowledge as the measure and pain as the guide.<br>The &quot;Returning Spring of Myriad Diseases&quot; states: for severe tongue swelling, first puncture the tip of the tongue, or draw blood from the top or side of the tongue. Only the Lianquan point under the tongue is forbidden to needle.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>&quot;DeXiao Fang&quot;: For heavy tongue scraping method, when there is a severe symptom on the tongue, use a finger to apply pressure under the tongue&#39;s frenulum, scraping from the base inward, gradually going deeper, repeating this three times; then, also use a finger dipped in water to apply pressure on the small pit behind the nape, forcing downward until it reaches a small bend, scraping deeply, also three times. If the child drinks milk better than before, then the illness is cured.</p>
<p>&quot;The Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: For a heavy tongue under the tongue, first diffuse the kidney water at the affected area, then wash it under the tongue and open the lung meridian by exhaling and inhaling.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Filial Duty of Confucianism&quot; states: The neighbor, Old Man Zhu from the South, is over sixty years old. He has had a fever for several days that persists, the base of his tongue is swollen, and the tip of his tongue is also swollen, swelling to fill his mouth, twice the size of a normal tongue. A surgeon punctured the sides of his tongue with a burning needle at the lower jianquan points, the condition worsened dangerously, nearing collapse. An observer said: If the blood is indeed full, it should be resolved with a (Gold Fei) needle. Grind it to be extremely sharp for gentle scraping, scraping eight to nine times a day, blood flows out approximately one to two cups, this occurred three times, gradually the blood diminished, pain reduced, and swelling subsided. The tongue is the external manifestation of the heart. The heart governs blood, thus when blood flows out, healing occurs. It also states: All pains, itchiness, sores, and ulcers are due to heart fire. What is the significance of the burning needle and the fire of the mugwort?<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>A woman had a swollen tongue that filled her mouth, and no medicines could help her. I used a small, sharp (gold needle) to puncture it. After five to seven applications, the swelling reduced, and it took three days to become normal again. The amount of blood that came out was nearly a bucket.</p>
<p>The &quot;Benshifang&quot; says: A scholar returned home at night, and his wife was already asleep. He shook her, and when she asked what was the matter, he did not answer. He shook her again, and she looked at him in surprise; her tongue was swollen and filled her mouth, preventing her from speaking. He urgently sought a doctor, who arrived carrying a pouch and applied medicine that quickly returned her to normal by morning. Upon inquiry, it was identified as a type of cattail pollen.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: A woman who was prone to anger had a strong tongue, and her arms were edematous. I noted that the tongue corresponds to the spleen (earth), and the liver (wood) counteracts it. I treated her with the Six Gentles Decoction, adding Bupleurum and Peony, and she recovered.</p>
<p>My elder brother had a sore, ulcerated tongue, with phlegm and saliva obstructing it. He maintained his usual diet but would almost faint in strong wind. I treated him with the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction and the Eight Flavor Pill, and he recovered. After taking those medicines a few days apart, it would recur; each time he exerted himself, phlegm increased and his eyes turned red. I had him rinse with cold water, and the tongue slightly improved. Moments later, it grew worse, so I had him suck on aconite slices, and he was cured. After taking the first two medicines, all symptoms were resolved.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>In the year of Hongzhi, in the year of the Yin Rooster (1491), Jiang Menghui from Jintai suffered from typhoid fever, his tongue completely black, and his hands and feet cold, unable to stop vomiting. The other doctors continued to treat him with heat methods, nearly leading to a critical situation. The judge, Wu Renzhai, administered the warming remedy Fuzi LI Zhong Tang, which cured him. The essence of medicine lies in using the right remedy for each illness. Fuzi treats cold; its effectiveness is considerable. How unfortunate it is that the world generally believes it to be a medicine that should not be used, preferring to let people die rather than save them. Isn’t it a pity! As for using medicine appropriately, results can vary, and one cannot casually dismiss it as utterly ineffective and abandon it.</p>
<p>When I was in the capital, Zheng Rudong&#39;s brother-in-law suffered from typhoid fever, his tongue completely black. The clinic&#39;s physician, Zeng Xi, suggested using Fuzi LI Zhong Tang, but everyone was alarmed and did not proceed. When he became extremely weak and preparations for his coffin began, Zeng returned to check on him, saying that using the previous medicine still had a chance for survival. His family had already resigned to his death, but they abandoned that thought and followed his suggestion, and after a few doses, he recovered. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, when the tongue is black, if it appears as if extreme fire resembles water, this aligns with what Scholar Du referred to when he spoke of fire becoming black charcoal, which calls for remedies like Liangge San to drain excess Yang. However, when water comes to conquer fire, this corresponds to what Physician Zeng treated, necessitating LI Zhong Tang to clear the Yin obstructions. It is also important to use mature ginger, sliced and gently rubbed on the tongue; if the color recedes a bit, it is treatable; if it remains stubborn and does not improve, it is not treatable.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>A man, heedlessly indulging in wine and lust, took pleasure in cold drinks during winter. He experienced tongue pain, frequent urination, and a swollen tongue with excessive phlegm. This indicated that the kidney water was depleted and the yin fire was uncontrolled, resulting in what is termed &quot;lower consumption,&quot; which was treated with a modified Eight Flavor Pill and he recovered. If the pulse is strong, rapid, and forceful, with a preference for drinking and reduced appetite, normal bowel movements, canker sores on the tongue, and intense thirst leading to drinking, this is referred to as &quot;upper consumption,&quot; indicating that the heart has transferred heat to the lungs, to be treated with White Tiger Decoction plus ginseng. If the pulse at the guan position is strong, rapid, and forceful, with a preference for cold drinks, yellow urine, hard and difficult stools, and spontaneous sweating, this is termed &quot;middle consumption,&quot; treated with the Regulate the Stomach and Promote the Flow Decoction.</p>
<p>Scholar Wu Beichuan, having overindulged in drinking, had a swollen tongue, unclear speech, phlegm and qi surging prominently, and limbs that were unresponsive. I treated him for damp phlegm in the spleen and he recovered. </p>
<p>Autumn official Zheng, having overindulged in drinking, also had a swollen tongue and unclear speech. This indicated spleen deficiency with damp heat, treated with a tonic to benefit qi, adding shen qu, malt, dried葛, and ze xie to aid recovery.</p>
<p>A wealthy individual suffered from tongue pain, utilizing topical and medicinal desensitizing agents, yet the tongue was swelling acutely. I punctured the tip of the tongue and both sides, releasing about a cup of purple blood, causing slight reduction of swelling; after administering one dose of rhinoceros horn and rehmannia decoction, it swelled again the next morning. I punctured it once more, releasing about a cup of purple blood, and the swelling diminished again; yet, after a long time, the tongue was swelling significantly. I then punctured to release about two cups of black blood, with gradual reduction of swelling. Suddenly, he experienced chills and fever, nausea, headaches, and a floating, rapid pulse; although the pathogen had departed, the true qi was increasingly damaged. I treated with a formula to tonify qi, doubling the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, and after four doses he stabilized, with several additional doses resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>A woman was prone to anger, and her tongue was swollen and caused discomfort. After using medications to reduce heat and transform phlegm, her symptoms worsened, with tension in her sides and abdominal bloating. Her menstrual flow did not cease. The diagnosis indicated a deficiency in the liver&#39;s ability to store blood and a deficiency in the spleen&#39;s ability to manage blood. Treatment with an enhanced version of the Gui Pi decoction, adding Mai Men Dong and Five Flavor Herb, led to recovery. If her condition arose from violent anger, a prescription of Xiao Chai Hu decoction with Dan Pi and Shan Zhi was used. In cases of blood deficiency, Ba Zhen Tang was modified with Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Dan Pi, and if the deficiency was severe, Pao Jiang would be added.</p>
<p>A man presented with tightness under the tongue, numbness in the thumb and index fingers, and either constipation or skin redness. This indicated wind-heat and blood deficiency of the large intestine, which improved with the use of Xiao Yao San supplemented with Huai Jiao and Qin Jiao.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a cerebral abscess in winter, experiencing swelling, pain, heat, and thirst, with a rapid and forceful pulse. The condition was alleviated with a cooling and detoxifying powder for ulceration. In March of the following year, she had severe swelling of the tongue and developed numerous purple sores all over her body resembling grapes, particularly on her hands and feet. After incising these to release black blood and taking seven pills of Da Ming Dan, she experienced a foul sweat, with the sores worsening and constipation persisting for two days. A combination of Da Huang, Qing, and Lian at three qian each, along with Sheng Ma, Bai Zhi, Shan Zhi, Bo He, Lian Qiao at two qian each, and one qian of raw Gan Cao, was boiled in water and taken. This led to a significant release of foul blood in both excretions, and her condition slightly improved. Then, the powdered mixture was combined with Rhinoceros horn juice for further consumption, leading to foul blood discharge from both the root of the tongue and the gaps between her teeth, ultimately resolving the toxicity. Finally, the Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang was administered, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The Ministry of Works official Xu Jianzhai had mouth sores, enjoyed cold foods, occasionally felt pain in the throat, and suffered from constipation; this was indeed heat in his body.

<p>Zhong Shiyu, who often worried, experienced tongue pain and used bitter cold herbs to lower the fire, resulting in a fever and blood in his stools, along with night sweats, dry mouth, and significant weight loss. This was due to the deficiency of the spleen&#39;s energy and blood-heat; he was treated with an enhanced Gui Pi Decoction and recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: A woman, after giving birth, could not retract her tongue. Zhu Sha was applied to her tongue. Zhou Zhen witnessed this and had her imitate childbirth, with the support of two women. A basin was placed outside on the wall, and when it fell and made a noise, her tongue retracted.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Medical Texts&quot; mentions: Wang Kuan treated a wealthy merchant who, due to fright, extended his tongue and could not retract it. For ten days, he could not swallow food, and he became extremely weak; the national physicians could not heal him. His family posted a notice in the market offering a reward of a thousand gold pieces for anyone who could cure him. Kuan&#39;s medical reputation was not yet established, and his expertise was still developing. He consulted the &quot;Puncture Classics,&quot; which provided needling techniques for this condition, and he went to treat the patient. By needling the base of the tongue and removing the needle, the tongue began to move as it normally would.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Formulations Examination&quot; states: There was a person with a swollen tongue, extending outside the mouth, and no one dared to treat him. A villager said that he happened to have this medicine; he went home to fetch it, which turned out to be two pieces of paper twisted into a wick. He burned it with a lamp to create smoke, which he then used to fumigate the tongue, and it immediately reduced in size. When asked about the method, the villager replied: In my family, we used to have an ox that also had a swollen tongue. People advised using castor oil soaked in paper twisted into a wick, burning it to fumigate, and it cured the ox, so I used it on people as well, and it proved effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states: When I was in Yandu, I once treated a man named Wang who suffered from kidney deficiency due to cold damage at the age of thirty. His tongue was very black, with prickles dried and cracked, charred black like coal. He had a fever, constipation, intense thirst preferring cold, but his pulse was weak, and his spirit was dull. Many doctors said he had a yang condition with an阴 pulse and would surely die. However, I observed that his form and vitality had not yet escaped, so I administered large doses of sweet warming tonics to strengthen his foundation, while intermittently using cool water to nourish his exterior. Water is the essence of Heaven&#39;s oneness; the cool can relieve heat, and sweetness can help the阴, unlike the bitter cold that damages the vital energy. Therefore, even in cases of dry fluids, yin deficiency, and intense heat with thirst, it should not be avoided.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>From this, both the water and medicine were administered together. In total, they used one to two pounds of ginseng and cooked rehmannia, several liang of aconite and cinnamon, and one to two dou of cold water. Gradually, the various symptoms receded, food intake increased, and both spirit and energy were restored. However, upon examining the tongue, if it remained black, there was no reduction at all. I was greatly perplexed and unable to find an explanation. After a few more days, the black coating on the tongue shed, revealing bright new flesh underneath. It became clear that the skin and pores were scorched and had died but then revived. Without significant nourishment, how could there be a rebirth? This particular case is noted as an extreme example. Furthermore, there are countless instances where a black tongue was treated with tonics and preserved. Therefore, when diagnosing febrile diseases, one should discern between internal and external cold and heat based on the color of the tongue. If one were to differentiate between deficiency and excess based on this, mistakes could not be avoided. Indeed, excess can lead to a black tongue from excessive fire causing scorching; deficiency can also lead to a black tongue from water deficiency causing withering. If both yellow and black tongues are entirely considered as signs of excess heat, then there is no chance for a diagnosis of yin deficiency.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　胎色</p>
<p>　　舌者，心之官，法应南方。火本红而泽。伤寒三四日已后，舌上有膜白滑如胎，甚者或燥，或濇，或黄，或黑，是数者热气浅深之谓也。邪气在表者，舌上则无胎。及邪气传里，津液结搏，则舌上生胎也。寒邪初传，未全成热，或在半表，或在半里，或邪气客于胸中者，皆舌上胎白而滑也。经曰：舌上如胎者，以丹田有热，胸中有寒，邪初传入里者也。阳明病胁下鞕满，不大便而呕，舌上白胎者，可与小柴胡汤，是邪气在半表半里者也。阳明病若下之，则胃中空虚，客气动膈，心中懊憹，舌上胎者，栀子豉汤主之，是邪客于胸中者也。<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>脏结宜若可下，舌上胎滑者，则云不可攻也，是邪未全成，热犹带表寒故也。及其邪传为热，则舌之胎不滑而濇也。经曰：伤寒七八日不解，热结在里，表里俱热，时时恶风，大渴，舌上干燥而烦，欲饮水数升者，白虎加人参汤主之。是热耗津液，而滑者已干也。若热聚于胃，则舌为之黄，是热已深也。《金匮要略》曰：舌黄，未下者，下之黄自去。若舌上色黑者，又为热之极也。《黄帝针经》曰：热病，口干舌黑者死。以心为君主之官，开窍于舌，黑为肾色，见于心部。心者，火，肾者，水。邪热已极，鬼贼相刑，故知必死。观其口舌，亦可见其逆顺矣。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　　　儒门事亲 【元　张从政】</p>

<p>　　卒中风则舌短而强，舌卷不言者死。大概风用小续命汤，寒用理中汤，热用甘桔汤加防风、枳壳、黄芩。风寒湿舌强者，用白矾、肉桂末等分，安舌下，或正舌药。痰热舌强，壅肿或短，甘露饮。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　　肿长</p>

<p>　　《本事方》云：　一士人夜归，其妻熟寝，士人撼之。妻问何事？不答。又撼之，其妻惊视之，舌肿已满口，不能出声。急访医，得一叟负囊而至，用药掺之，比晓复旧。问之，乃蒲黄一物。昆按《内经》曰：热胜则肿。此证必心脾之火并于舌，故令肿而满口。蒲黄性寒，能清气凉血，故愈。　　热证多舌出。有病愈而舌不能入者，以冰片分许，研末，掺其舌上，则入。所以舌出者，热实于内，而欲吐舌泄气也；所以不能入者，邪气久居，舌强而不柔和也。冰片味辛热而气清香，可以利窍，可以柔筋，可以泄气，故得之而舌入矣。　　有人舌肿，舒出口外，无敢医者。<a id="orig-30p" href="#trans-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>一村人云：偶有此药，归而取至，乃二纸捻，以灯烧之，取烟熏舌，随即消缩。众问其方，村人曰：吾家旧有一牛，亦舌肿胀出口，人教以蓖麻油蘸纸作捻，烧烟熏之而愈，因以治人亦验。昆谓：舌肿舒出口外，经所谓热胜则肿也。然舌者心之苗，又脾之经络连舌本，散舌下，其热当责于心脾二经。《本草》云：蓖麻主浮肿恶气，取油涂之，叶主风肿不仁，捣蒸敷之，则其能解风肿内热也可知矣。然用其烟犹有妙义，烟乃轻清之物，一入于口，呼吸传变，可使径达心脾，匪惟治标，亦可疗本。村人用之而不达其理，斯其所以为村人。医者闻之而不察其理，则亦村人而已矣！<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>
<p>　　　　　论胎色</p>
<p>　　舌胎舌黑，虽云火证，然实火虚火俱能为之。凡治此者，但当察脉证，以虚实为主，而再以辨色之法参之，庶可无误。盖实热之黑，必兼红紫干渴，或多芒刺；若沉黑少红而带润滑者，本非实热证也。若其六脉细弱，而形困气倦，则又最为虚候，是必寒水乘心火不归原之病，此不救本而但知治标，则万无一生矣。此之治法：凡里热未甚而表散有未解者，宜柴胡诸饮之类，以解其表；里邪热甚者，宜凉膈散、犀角地黄汤之类以清其内，此治实热之法也。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>若阴虚火盛，而兼有表邪未解者，宜补阴益气煎之类兼表里而治之；若形气病气俱不足，寒水乘心而虚阳不敛者，必用理阴煎、理中汤或大补元煎之类，以单救其里，自可保其无虞，此治虚火之法也。若舌有白胎，语言蹇濇者，以薄荷、白蜜同姜片，蘸而揩擦之。　　舌为心之官，本红而泽。凡伤寒三四日已后，舌上有胎必自润而燥，自滑而濇，由白而黄，由黄而黑，甚至焦干，或生芒刺，是皆邪热内传由浅入深之证也。故凡邪气在表，舌则无胎，及其传里，则津液干燥而舌胎生矣。若邪犹未深，其在半表半里之间，或邪气客于胸中者，其胎不黑不濇，止宜小柴胡之属以和之。若阳邪传里，胃中有热，则舌胎不滑而濇，宜栀子豉汤之属以清之。若烦躁欲饮水数升者，白虎加人参汤之类主之。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>大都舌上黄胎而焦濇者，胃腑有邪热也，或清之或微下之。《金匮要略》曰：舌黄未下者，下之黄自去。然必大便燥实，脉沉有力而大渴者，方可下之。若微渴而脉不实，便不坚，胎不干燥芒刺者，不可下也。其有舌上黑胎而生芒刺者，则热更甚矣，宜凉膈散、承气汤、大柴胡之属酌宜下之。若胎色虽黑滑而不濇者，便非实邪，亦非火证，非惟不可下，且不可清也。此辨舌之概，虽云若此，然犹有不可概论者，仍宜详察如左。　　按伤寒诸书皆云：心为君主之官，开窍于舌。心主火，肾主水，黑为水色而见于心部，是为鬼贼相刑，故知必死。此虽据理之谈，然实有未必然者。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>夫五行相制，难免无克，此其所以为病，岂因克为病，便为必死？但当察其根本何如也。如黑色连地而灰黯无神，此其本源已败，死无疑矣。若舌心焦黑而质地红活，未必皆死证。阳实者清其胃火，火退自愈，何虑之有！其有元气大损而阴邪独见者，其色亦黄黑；真水涸竭者，其舌亦干焦。肾中水火俱亏，原非实热之证，欲辨此者，但察其形气脉色，自有虚实可辨，而从补从清，反如冰炭矣。故凡以焦枯干濇者，尚有非实非火之证。再若青黑少神而润滑不燥者，则无非水乘火位，虚寒证也。若认此为火，而苦寒一投，则余烬随灭矣。故凡见此者，但当详求脉证，以虚实为主，不可因其焦黑而执言清火也！伤寒固尔，诸证亦然。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>　　　　　重舌木舌</p>

<p>　　亡血之后，口舌燥裂不能饮食者，死。盖亡血自然无血以生精，精涸则津亦涸，必然之势也。欲使口舌之干者重润，必须使精血之竭者重生。补精之方，六味丸最妙，然而六味丸单补肾中之精，而不能上补口舌之津也。虽补肾于下，亦能通津于上，然终觉缓不济急。我今定一奇方，上下兼补，名上下相资汤，熟地、麦冬各一两，山茱萸、沙参、当归、牛膝、葳蕤各五钱，人参、元参各三钱，北五味二钱，车前子一钱，水煎服。此方补肾为君，而兼以补肺之药，子母相资，上下兼润，精生而液亦生，血生而津亦生矣，安在危亡之证不可庆再生耶？<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>　　　　　干肿</p>
<p>　　燥证舌干肿大，溺血，大便又便血不止，亦是死证。盖感暑热之毒，至秋而燥极，肺金清肃之令不行，大小便热极而齐便血也。论理见血宜治血矣，然而治血，血偏不止，反至燥添而不可救。吾不治血，专治燥，方用兼润丸，熟地、当归、白芍各一两，元参、麦冬、沙参各二两，车前子、生地各五钱，地榆三钱，水煎服。一剂轻，二剂血止，便有生机也。此方纯是补血妙品，惟用地榆以清火，车前子以利水，火清水利，不必治血，血自治也。<br>　　　　　吐出</p>
<p>　　如人舌吐出，不肯收进，乃阳火盛强之故，以冰片少许点之，即收。后用黄连、人参、白芍各三钱，菖蒲、柴胡各一钱，水煎服，二剂可也。<a id="orig-42p" href="#trans-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>　　　　　缩入</p>

<p><strong>Tongue Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong><br>The south generates heat, heat generates fire, fire produces bitterness, bitterness produces the heart, and the heart governs the tongue, which is expressed in the orifice as the tongue. [Note: The heart&#39;s energy connects with the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, it can comprehend the five flavors, hence the tongue is the master of the heart. Additionally, the tongue is an organ of the heart, thus the heart&#39;s orifice is in the tongue.]</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion on Essential Diagnosis</strong><br>The terminal condition of Jueyin: internal heat leads to a dry throat, difficulty in urination, and a troubled heart; in severe cases, the tongue curls, and the testicles retract, leading to the end. [Note: The liver corresponds to the sinews, the sinews gather in the Yin organ; thus the tongue curls and the testicles retract.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong><br>In summer, the damaging winds affecting Bing and Ding are identified as Heart Wind. The symptoms of Heart Wind are excessive sweating, aversion to wind, scorching pain, and irritability that is red in color. In severe cases, speech is impeded, the diagnosis resides in the mouth, which appears red. [Note: The heart is a fire organ; when the wind is excessive, the fire becomes intense, hence the lips and mouth become scorched, and bodily fluids are depleted. The wind transforms wood, and the interaction of wood and fire becomes intense, causing irritability. The heart governs the tongue; in severe illness, the base of the tongue is strong, making speech difficult. When the heart is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five flavors, thus the diagnosis is in the mouth.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse of the heart is strong and lengthy; when there is illness, the tongue will curl and be unable to speak.<br>(Note: A strong and lengthy pulse indicates vigorous and prolonged heartbeat; this manifests from excessive heart fire, hence the tongue curls. The heart governs speech, and thus one cannot speak.)</p>
<p>For lung heat diseases, one first experiences a shivery sensation, the hair rising, and a dislike of wind and cold; the tongue appears yellow and the body feels warm.<br>(Note: The skin and hair relate to the lungs; internal heat causes chilly sensations externally, leading to a dislike of wind and cold.

The extreme Yang governs, which can lead to chest and flank pain, and the tongue becomes difficult to use.<br>(Note: If there is governance leading to chest and flank pain, it is due to the liver meridian extending through those areas.

<p>The spleen channel of the foot Taiyin ascends through the diaphragm, flanking the throat, connecting to the root of the tongue, and spreading beneath the tongue.

After eating, when gas is released, there is a feeling of relief as if one is recovering from fatigue, but the body feels heavy. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;root of the tongue&quot; refers to the base of the tongue. Symptoms like discomfort at the root of the tongue and vomiting during meals are illnesses caused by the spleen channel. Frequent belching signifies that the spleen qi ascends to the heart. The feeling of relief after gas is released signifies a reversal of qi dispersing up and down. The heaviness of the body indicates the counterflow of Taiyin qi.]</p>
<p>The kidney channel of the foot Shaoyin runs alongside the throat and flanks the root of the tongue. It governs ailments related to the kidneys, leading to symptoms of a hot mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat, shortness of breath, dryness and pain in the throat, anxiety, and heart pain. </p>
<p>[Note: The kidneys govern essence. Hence, ailments arising from the kidneys prevent essence fluids from nourishing, resulting in a hot mouth, dry tongue, throat pain, anxiety, and other symptoms, as water does not rise to nurture, causing fire to become excessive.]</p>

<p><strong>Tongue Treatise</strong></p>
<p>The tongue reflects the heart and the status of the small intestine. A tongue weighs ten ounces, measures seven inches in length, and two and a half inches in width. It is adept at assessing and can balance the five flavors. When eating, if one consumes too much salt, the tongue pulse becomes congealed and discolored; too much bitterness leads to a dry appearance of the tongue&#39;s surface; too much spiciness causes the tongue muscles to tighten and the edges to become dry; too much sourness makes the tongue flesh swell and the lips reveal; too much sweetness results in pain at the root of the tongue and loss of its outer surface. It is noted that the heart desires bitterness, the lungs desire spiciness, the liver desires sourness, the spleen desires sweetness, and the kidneys desire salt—these five flavors correspond to the qi of the five organs. If the organs are heated, the tongue develops sores, and the lips are revealed and red; if the bowels are cold, the tongue&#39;s base retracts, and the mouth is tight with blue lips. Cold should be supplemented, heat should be drained; when neither cold nor heat is present, adjustments should be made based on the organs. If the tongue retracts and the mouth is tight with blue lips, Sheng Ma Decoction is the proper treatment.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Lotus Flower Tongue</h3>
<p>Beneath the tongue are three small sub-tongues, resembling the shape of a lotus flower. However, the tongue is also a sprout of the heart. When the heart fire rises, it may result from excessive thinking, being harmed by fire, or taking cool air after drinking, which leads to wind-phlegm clashing and forming. For this condition, it is urgently advised to use a cooling detoxifying decoction with adjustments, and additionally apply powdered borneol. If swelling does not subside, it is advisable to use a small knife or needle to release purple blood.</p>
<h3>Fetal Color</h3>
<p>The tongue is the official of the heart and should correspond to the southern direction. Fire is inherently red and moist. After three to four days of cold damage, a membrane may appear on the tongue, white and slippery like that of a fetus. In severe cases, it may be dry, or have a yellow or black appearance, indicating varying depths of heat. If the evil qi is on the surface, the tongue will not show a membrane. However, when the evil qi penetrates inward and bodily fluids become obstructed, a membrane will form on the tongue. When cold evil first invades, the heat may not yet be fully formed, which may present as either a partial exterior or interior condition, or if the evil qi resides in the chest, the tongue will show a white and slippery membrane. The classics say: &quot;A tongue that appears like a fetus indicates heat in the elixir field and cold in the chest, signifying the initial invasion of evil qi into the interior.&quot; In cases of Yangming disease with fullness under the ribs, constipation leading to vomiting, a white membranous tongue indicates that evil qi remains at the half surface and half interior. If Yangming disease is treated with purging, this may leave the stomach void, causing external qi to disturb the diaphragm, resulting in agitation in the heart. In such cases, a membranous tongue calls for the use of gardenia and fermented soy extract soup, indicating that evil qi resides in the chest.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are dirty blockages that can be purged, and the tongue has a smooth coating, it is said that one should not attack, as the evil is not yet fully formed and the heat is still accompanied by cold. When the evil transforms into heat, the coating on the tongue becomes dry and rough. The classics state: If a febrile illness does not resolve after seven or eight days, it indicates that heat is locked inside, with both exterior and interior presenting heat, accompanied by intermittent chills, severe thirst, and a dry, vexed tongue, with a desire to drink several liters of water, the remedy is Baihu Jiajinshen Decoction. This heat depletes body fluids, and the smoothness has already dried up. If heat accumulates in the stomach, the tongue will turn yellow, indicating that the heat has penetrated deeply. The &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot; states: If the tongue is yellow and yet remains untreated, purging will cause the yellow to disappear. If the tongue is black, it indicates extreme heat. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: In heat illnesses, a dry mouth and a black tongue lead to death. The heart is regarded as the monarch, opening its orifices in the tongue. Black corresponds to the color of the kidney, reflected in the heart region. The heart symbolizes fire, while the kidney symbolizes water. When the evil heat reaches its extreme, it is a dire condition, indicating certain death. Observing the tongue and mouth also reveals the state of disorder or harmony within.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>Heat manifests under the tongue, resulting in a small growth known as &quot;child tongue swelling&quot;; when heat is present within the tongue, the tongue becomes swollen, referred to as &quot;wooden tongue swelling.&quot; The term &quot;wood&quot; implies strength without gentleness. Minor cases can be softened, while severe cases require a pungent remedy. Once, I treated a woman with wooden tongue swelling; her tongue filled her mouth, and various medicines did not help.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Sores on the Tongue</h3>
<p>Sores on the tongue are caused by heat and obstruction in the upper body. It is advisable to use the Holy Decoction or Sweet Tangerine Decoction with ten qian of Scutellaria, and mix in Willow Flower Powder, or apply white lotus petals.</p>
<h3>The Tongue and the Five Tastes</h3>
<p>The heart&#39;s energy connects to the tongue, enabling it to discern the five tastes; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the mouth, allowing it to recognize the flavors of the five grains.</p>
<h3>Tongue Disorders</h3>
<p>The tongue is the organ of the heart, responsible for tasting the five flavors and distributing them to the five organs. The heart&#39;s main vessel is connected to the root of the tongue, while the spleen&#39;s network connects to the sides of the tongue. The liver&#39;s vessels circulate through the tongue&#39;s base, and the kidneys&#39; fluids come out at the tongue&#39;s tip, distributing to the five organs, under the heart&#39;s control. If the three meridians are affected by the four Qi, the tongue may curl and be unable to speak; if the seven emotions are stagnant, the tongue may swell and be unable to articulate. For instance, if heat in the heart causes the tongue to ulcerate, obstruction in the liver may lead to bleeding like a surge, and blockage in the spleen may cause a white coating reminiscent of snow. These are the disorders of the tongue. The heart&#39;s energy connects to the tongue, and harmony in the heart enables the discernment of five tastes; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the mouth, and harmony in the spleen allows for the recognition of the flavors of grains.</p>
<h3>Heavy Tongue</h3>
<p>For a heavy tongue, first rinse with cool water, then chew fresh peppermint leaves (five to seven leaves), followed by thoroughly chewing a piece of the Holy Golden Essence until it is extremely fine, then swallow with well water. In severe cases, take three doses continuously, and place a piece directly on the affected area; the illness will dissipate along with the medicine.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tongue Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>If the tongue is rotten at its base and heat persists, it is a sign of rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br>In the past, there were cases of ulcerated sores on the tongue that developed into cavities over time, and repeated use of cooling agents was ineffective. Eventually, the administration of Heixi Dan led to gradual recovery. This condition stems from deficiency below, thus leading to excess above. Additionally, if there is external swelling of the tongue, it is referred to as &quot;heavy tongue,&quot; treated with a powder of true Puhuang. There are also cases where the tongue is inexplicably numb, which should not be treated as wind; instead, it is due to insufficient heart blood and can be addressed with a modified Lizhong Decoction by adding half a qian of熟附子 (prepared Aconite) and half a qian of Angelica.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br>The connection of the five organs to the tongue is as follows: the heart&#39;s primary vessels are attached at the root of the tongue, the spleen&#39;s collateral vessels are connected to the sides of the tongue, the liver&#39;s vessels run along the yin organs and connect at the base of the tongue, and the kidney’s fluids emerge at the tip of the tongue, distributing moisture to the five organs, with the heart primarily governing this. Thus, it is said: all channels converge at the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Shortness and Rigidity of the Tongue</strong><br>In cases of sudden stroke, the tongue becomes short and rigid; if it curls and speech is lost, the patient may be near death. Generally, when there is wind, one uses the Xiao Xun Ming Decoction; for cold, the Lizhong Decoction; and for heat, a Sweet Tangerine Decoction with additional Fangfeng, Zhuhe, and Huangqin. If the tongue is stiff due to wind, cold, and dampness, use equal parts of alum and cinnamon powder to stabilize the tongue, or apply proper tongue medication. For a stiff tongue due to phlegm heat, which may also be swollen or shortened, use the Ganlu Drink.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Swelling of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If the swelling is due to emotional factors causing stagnation of Qi, use Jin Fei Cao San. If it does not heal after a long time, apply Hei Shen Wan externally with ancient frost salt. If caused by anger, apply rusted iron powder.</p>
<p>For a swollen tongue, making it hard to expel air, it is referred to as &quot;wood tongue.&quot; Use aged tea and aged white plum, combined with seven Bajiao beans, pound them into a paste, rinse the mouth with mint water, and as soon as it is possible to swallow, take one or two pieces and supplement with congee. If there are sores connected to swelling of the cheeks, use Yuan Shen Sheng Ma Tang.</p>
<p>For a swollen tongue that cannot produce sound and impedes food intake, known as &quot;heavy tongue,&quot; continuously brush the tongue with catkins to help it reduce. If one cannot swallow medicine, take concentrated huanglian decoction and sip it frequently to clear heart fire.</p>
<p>If the tongue is swollen like a pig&#39;s bladder, pierce the large veins on both sides under the tongue; when the blood flows out, the swelling will subside. Be careful not to pierce the veins themselves, which could cause continuous bleeding. Cauterize with a copper chopstick heated by fire; if bleeding does not stop, it could be fatal. Alternatively, mix vinegar with charcoal and apply it to both sides of the tongue; remove and reapply until it naturally subsides. If one refuses to eat, it could also be fatal.</p>
<p>If the tongue is swollen and there are insects underneath resembling cricket or silkworm, small white head with a tail, it can be cauterized with hot iron directly on the tongue to make it disappear.</p>
<p>If the tongue extends beyond an inch, apply powdered Bingshen (borax) to it.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Fetal Color</strong></p>
<p>The tongue represents the heart&#39;s sprout, and the kidneys govern bodily fluids. When healthy, the tongue is red and moist; occasional red spots on the tongue indicate impending yellowing. If there is evildoing heat in the lower abdomen, the heart&#39;s sprout becomes withered, leading to a pale appearance akin to a white fetus. Thus, when evil is on the surface, there is no fetus; when it first penetrates inward, the fetus is pale and slippery. If there are symptoms of cold and heat in the stomach, use Zhizhi decoction to expel it. For Yangming disease with a hard side, constipation, and vomiting, where the tongue coating is white, do not forcefully purge; use Xiao Chaihu decoction to harmonize. If there is aversion to cold and the desire to vomit phlegm, add dried ginger to Xiao Chaihu. A slippery white fetus with diarrhea indicates internal stagnation, which should not be treated. As heat deepens, the fetus becomes white and dry; if heat deeply enters the stomach, the fetus becomes yellow, either plump and shiny or sharply white with a yellow root, suggesting an external excess with internal deficiency. Both require Baihu decoction with ginseng. Sweating in the hands, feet, and underarms, irregular speech, constipation, and a fetus appearing purple or black, or presenting with spikes or insect-like dry cracks, should be treated with Chengqi decoction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are several types of black tongues. A tongue that is red at the edges and gray-black in the center indicates a loss of fluids. A tongue with a black ring signifies unresolved pathogens. A tongue with a black tip indicates internal distress. If the tongue shows yellow with black in the middle and either a black tip or irregular black spots, it indicates deep heat toxicity. A tongue with red stripes and a black center, or black spots within a white coating, suggests unresolved exterior pathogens. A tongue with a black root and a yellow tip, accompanied by a slippery pulse, may indicate that it can be purged; if the pulse is floating, it can indicate sweating. A tongue that is sharply black with irregular lines and a slippery yet solid pulse requires urgent purging. If the pulse is rapid and weak, there will surely be thirst leading to death. </p>
<p>In general, regardless of the degree of blackness, a black tongue all indicates a dangerous condition. Only if it is cold and slippery, resembling a pale black, does it signify rootless false heat, which can be treated with medicines to transform phlegm and reduce heat. </p>

<p><strong>Tongue Related to Heart and Spleen</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is associated with the heart and spleen. The classics say: the heart governs the tongue. It is also stated: in organs it is the heart, in orifices it is the tongue. Furthermore, it is said: the heart&#39;s energy flows to the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five tastes. Thus, the tongue is related to the heart. Additionally, the central area is yellow, connected to the spleen, opening at the mouth, and storing essence in the spleen, hence diseases at the base of the tongue are related to the spleen.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Tongue</strong></p>
<p>A small structure resembling the tongue that grows under the root of the tongue is called a heavy tongue; if it is attached inside the cheek or to the hard palate, it is called a heavy palate; if it is attached above the gums, it is called a heavy gum. All these should be pricked, and blood can be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>A wooden tongue refers to a tongue that is swollen, thick, and gradually hardens, filling the mouth. If not treated promptly, it may lead to death. The method is to use two qian of purple snow, mixed with bamboo juice, to frequently apply in the mouth to resolve the condition.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Oral and Pharyngeal Issues</strong> </p>
<p>It is said: the tongue is a seed of the heart. This is expressed through obscure words. Speaking partially, each of the five organs has its corresponding aspect; when discussing in depth, each organ has its own master. For instance, if there is swelling and pain in the mouth and tongue, or if it appears as if there is no skin, or if there are symptoms of fever and thirst, this indicates a deficiency of central energy with heat. If the eyes appear smoky, the body feels fatigued with little appetite, or if symptoms worsen in the afternoon, this points to deficiency of yin and blood with heat. If there is throat pain, tongue sores, dry mouth, and significant heat in the feet, during the day it worsens, this indicates deficiency fire in the kidney channel. If the limbs feel cold and there is aversion to eating, or if phlegm is heavy and eyes are red, this suggests decline of fire at the gate of life. If there is fever and thirst, drinking cold beverages leads to constipation, this is indicative of excess fire in the spleen and stomach. If there is fever and chills, dry mouth and thirst, little food intake, and fatigue, this indicates deficiency heat in the spleen channel. If the tongue root is strong and there is swelling and pain in the cheeks and jaw, this signifies damp heat in the spleen channel. If phlegm is abundant causing thirst, with swelling and pain in the mouth and tongue, this shows heat in the upper burner. If there are excessive thoughts leading to sores in the mouth and tongue, and discomfort in the throat, this reflects injury to the blood of the spleen channel causing fire to stir. If there is excessive anger, with a bitter feeling in the mouth and swollen tongue, this indicates injury to the blood of the liver channel causing fire to stir. The causes of disease are numerous, requiring appropriate responses based on the time. In cases of severe tongue swelling, it is advisable to first prick the tip of the tongue, or the top or sides, to cause bleeding and release toxins, thus alleviating the urgency. However, for the sublingual area of the kidney channel, while it may be beneficial to release blood, acupuncture should be avoided.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

The Nei Jing states: The heart qi communicates with the tongue; when the heart is harmonious, the tongue can recognize the five flavors. In illness, the tongue may retract and shorten, with redness in the cheeks, its pulse strong and long. Qiao Yue states: When the heart fails, the tongue cannot retract and cannot speak.]</strong><br>It also pertains to the Foot Taiyin Spleen Meridian.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Li Dongyuan said: The tongue is associated with the heart; it also knows taste, which indicates that the tongue contains elements of the spleen. In the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it is said that the foot Taiyin connects to the middle of the tongue. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: The center is yellow, which corresponds to the spleen, hence ailments at the root of the tongue. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; also mentions that the foot Taiyin, when active, causes tongue root stiffness, and illnesses arising will result in pain at the tongue root. Additionally, if the sublingual pulse is excessively needled, bleeding may occur, leading to muteness. The sublingual pulse is the spleen pulse; muteness refers to the inability to speak. Furthermore, Sun Jingsi stated: The tongue is governed by the heart’s qi and is connected to the spleen pulse. If the two organs are imbalanced, wind pathogens can invade, causing the tongue to stiffen and hinder speech, while phlegm heat attacks, leading to swelling and the inability to articulate. There are also symptoms such as heavy tongue, stiff tongue, tongue swelling, and bleeding, all resulting from the invasion of wind and heat on the heart and spleen channels. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is also associated with the foot Yangming stomach meridian. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Zhang Jifeng stated: The spleen and stomach govern the four limbs, their pulses connecting to the root of the tongue and linking to the lips and mouth. The stomach is the sea of fluids, the spleen processes and digests them, whereby the essence of these fluids transforms into nutrient defenses to nourish the four limbs. If one fails to maintain proper living habits or eats at irregular times, it leads to insufficient spleen and stomach qi, resulting in poor nourishment for defense, allowing wind pathogens to invade, causing paralysis of both the limbs and the lips, resulting in slurred speech. If untreated for a long time, it could develop into atrophy. The classics state that treating atrophy should focus on the Yangming system, namely the foot Yangming, and the treatment should emphasize the use of spleen and stomach remedies while minimizing medications to dispel wind for stability. </p>
<p>Additionally, it also belongs to the foot Shaoyin kidney meridian.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm Bag</strong></p>
<p>The phlegm bag is caused by phlegm and fluid rising with heat, condensing under the tongue, forming a soft, swollen mass similar to a gourd, which affects speech and causes pain and discomfort.

<h3>Discussion on Tongue Diseases</h3>
<p>According to the &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot;: A scholar returned home at night while his wife was asleep. He shook her, and when she asked what was the matter, he did not respond. He shook her again, and she looked at him in surprise, only to find her tongue swollen and filling her mouth, unable to speak. They urgently sought a doctor, who arrived carrying a pouch of medicine and mixed it for her, and by morning she had returned to her original condition. When asked, he revealed it was cattail pollen. Kun comments that &quot;The inner canon&quot; states: Excess heat causes swelling. This condition must arise from the combined fire of the heart and spleen affecting the tongue, causing swelling and filling the mouth. Cattail pollen is cold in nature and can clear qi and cool the blood, hence it cured her. </p>
<p>In cases of heat syndrome, there is often protrusion of the tongue. When one recovers yet the tongue cannot retract, use a bit of borneol, grind it into powder, and apply it to the tongue, and then it can retract. The reason for the tongue&#39;s protrusion is that heat is truly present inside, and it seeks to expel the tongue to release qi; the reason it cannot retract is that the pathogenic qi has long been lodged, making the tongue stiff and not pliable. Borneol is spicy and warming but has a clear fragrance, which can open the orifices, soften the tendons, and release qi. Thus, with its application, the tongue retracts. There are instances of swollen tongues that extend outward where no one dares to treat them.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A villager said: Occasionally there is this medicine; I returned home to fetch it, and found it to be two pieces of paper twisted into wicks. I burned them with a lamp to let the smoke waft over my tongue, and it immediately reduced the swelling. When others inquired about the method, the villager replied: In my family, there was an old cow whose tongue also became swollen and protruded. People taught to use castor oil to soak the paper wicks, burn them, and let the smoke treat it, which proved effective. </p>
<p>Kun remarked: When the tongue is swollen and protruding, it is said that heat overwhelms and causes the swelling. The tongue is the seed of the heart, and the spleen&#39;s meridians are connected to the root of the tongue. Thus, the heat should be attributed to the heart and spleen meridians. The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: Castor oil is effective for edema and eliminating foul gas; applying oil based on the leaves can alleviate wind swelling and numbness when pounded and steamed for application, which shows it can relieve internal heat from wind swelling. </p>
<p>However, the use of its smoke has a subtle meaning: smoke is a light and clear substance; once it enters the mouth, it can be transmitted and transformed through breathing, allowing it to reach directly to the heart and spleen. It not only addresses the symptoms but can also treat the root cause. The villager used it without understanding the principle; that is why he remains a villager. If a physician hears of it and fails to discern its reasoning, he is also merely a villager!<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Fetal Color</strong></p>
<p>A black tongue in a fetus, although said to indicate fiery symptoms, can actually result from both true and false heat. When addressing this condition, one should primarily observe the pulse to distinguish between true and false, and then use color differentiation as a secondary tool to avoid mistakes. Generally, true heat causing blackness will also show signs of red, purple, dry mouth, or several prickling sensations; if the black is deep with little red and is smooth, it does not indicate true heat. Conversely, if the six pulses are thin and weak, accompanied by a feeling of fatigue and depletion, this indicates a state of deficiency, suggesting that cold water is obstructing the heart&#39;s fire and not returning to its original state. Merely treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause guarantees an unsuccessful treatment. </p>
<p>The treatment method: If the heat within is not severe and there’s still some unresolved exterior issue, one should use drinks like Chai Hu decoctions to resolve the exterior; if the internal heat is quite severe, use remedies like Liang Ge San or Xijiao Dihuang Tang to clear the interior.

<p>If the tongue has a white coating and speech is slurred, one should use mint and white honey combined with ginger slices to apply and rub onto it.

Therefore, when the pathogenic qi is in the exterior, the tongue will not have a coating; when it transmits to the interior, the fluids become dry, leading to tongue coating formation. </p>
<p>If the pathogenic influence is still not deep, existing between the exterior and interior, or if the pathogenic qi is lodged in the chest, the coating will not be black or rough, and one should only use formulas like Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to harmonize it.

However, one must ensure that the stool is dry and firm, the pulse is deep, strong, and there is great thirst to consider purging. If there is only slight thirst, the pulse is weak, the stool is not hard, and the coating is not dry and prickly, purging is not appropriate. </p>
<p>If the tongue has a black coating with prickles, the heat is even more intense, and it is advisable to use cooling medicines such as Liangge Powder, Chengqi Decoction, or Da-Chaihu Decoction accordingly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Five Elements interact and restrain each other; it is inevitable that there will be overcoming, and this is why sickness arises. Is it because of overcoming that one must die? We must examine the root of the condition carefully. If there is black color touching the ground and looking gray and dull, its source is already ruined, and death is certain. However, if the tongue appears scorched and black but the texture is red and lively, it is not necessarily a sign of death. When yang energy is strong, it clears the stomach fire; if the fire recedes, healing will occur, so there is no need for concern! If there is great loss of vital energy and only yin pathogens are present, the color will also be yellow-black. If true water has dried up, the tongue will be dry and scorched as well. When both water and fire in the kidneys are deficient, it is not a sign of real heat. To discern this, one must observe the shape, energy, pulse, and color; the distinctions between deficiency and excess will become apparent, guiding one to tonify or clear accordingly, much like the difference between ice and fire. Therefore, anything that is scorched, dry, and withered may not indicate real heat or fire. Furthermore, if someone appears dark and lacking vitality but moist and not dry, it indicates that water is overcoming fire, which is a sign of deficiency-cold. Mistaking this for fire and administering bitter cold remedies would extinguish what little remains. Thus, for all such conditions, one must thoroughly investigate the pulse and symptoms, prioritizing deficiency and excess, rather than hastily concluding that the blackened appearance solely signifies clearing out heat! This applies to typhoid fever, and all other conditions similarly.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Sore in the Mouth</strong></p>
<p>A sore unexpectedly appears on the tongue inside the mouth, extending outward by an inch, forming a yellow scab on the surface. It makes eating difficult, and people believe the illness is in the heart, attributing it to internal heat causing this sore. This is indeed a common understanding, but it is not entirely accurate. There are also malevolent forces that may be involved. </p>
<p>A proper method is to take a small amount of borneol, place it inside a clam shell, and it will immediately dissolve into water. Then, a goose feather should be used to apply it on the sore; it can quickly be absorbed into the tongue, enabling eating and drinking again. The clam is an extremely Yin substance, so it attacks Yin-related evils, causing them to retreat. Furthermore, the pungent warmth of borneol helps drive out evils vigorously, ensuring success with little effort. </p>
<p>Sores on the tongue signify the presence of heat from the heart, and since the tongue is associated with the heart, it’s first seen as a connection. The method involves using three grams of Scutellaria (huanglian) and one gram of Acorus (changpu), boiled in water and taken as a single dose for recovery; this is a divine formula.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p>After the loss of blood, if the mouth and tongue are dry and cracked, making it impossible to eat or drink, death will ensue.

To restore moisture to the dry mouth and tongue, it is necessary to rejuvenate the depleted essence and blood. The Six Flavor Pill is the best method to replenish essence; however, it only supplements the essence in the kidneys and cannot nourish the fluids of the mouth and tongue. Although supplementing the kidneys can also facilitate the upper fluids, it still feels inadequate in urgent situations. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Swelling of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Dryness manifests as a dry and swollen tongue, with blood in the urine and continuous blood in the stool, which indicates a fatal condition. This results from the poisonous heat of summer, which becomes extreme in autumn, preventing the lung&#39;s metal from purifying and regulating. Consequently, both urine and stool become extremely hot and lead to blood. According to theory, upon seeing blood, one should treat it; however, treating the blood causes it to not cease, adding to the dryness and rendering it hopeless. Therefore, I do not treat the blood directly but focus on alleviating the dryness, using a formula called &quot;Jianrun Pills.&quot; The ingredients are one tael each of cooked Rehmannia, Angelica, and white peony, two taels each of Scrophularia, Ophiopogon, and Adenophora, five qian each of Plantago and fresh Rehmannia, and three qian of Chinese rhubarb, all decocted in water. One dose is light, two doses can stop the bleeding, thus bringing hope for recovery. This formula is purely excellent for nourishing the blood, using Chinese rhubarb to clear heat and Plantago to facilitate water flow. With the heat cleared and water facilitated, treating the blood is unnecessary, as it will resolve itself.</p>
<p><strong>Protruding Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If a person&#39;s tongue is protruding and refuses to retract, it is due to excessive yang fire. Applying a small amount of borneol can help retract it. Later, administer three qian each of Coptis, ginseng, and white peony, and one qian each of sweet flag and bupleurum, decocted in water; two doses should suffice.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Contraction of the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>When a person&#39;s tongue retracts into the throat and they are unable to speak, it is due to cold energy obstructing the chest and abdomen. One should urgently use three qian of ginseng, five qian of white atractylodes, and one qian each of cinnamon, aconite, and dried ginger to treat this, then the tongue will relax.</p>
<p><strong>Reattachment of a Severed Tongue</strong></p>
<p>If a person&#39;s tongue tip is bitten off or the root is severed, whether it has been one day, two days, or half a month, it can all be reattached. Quickly take a dog’s tongue and ensure its size and cut match the man&#39;s tongue. Have the patient sit in a chair, leaning back with their head against the chair, and hold their throat with their hand to extend the tongue. Dip the dog&#39;s tongue in medicinal powder and place it on the human tongue; once connected, it will not fall off. The medicinal powder recipe is as follows: three qian each of dragon teeth and ginseng, three fen of borneol, one qian of elephant skin, and three headless and wingless earth dogs, plus twenty earth lice. First, grind all items of ginseng into powder, then mash the earth lice and earth dogs into the preceding powder, mix well, and wear this powder on the body for three days. When dried, store it in a bottle. This medicinal powder is remarkably effective for such conditions. A broken bone will heal with one qian; this is a miraculous remedy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The one who is severed can be long again.</p>
<p>I have heard people say that one can regrow a lost tongue by rinsing it with vinegar; this claim is highly erroneous. When flesh encounters acidity, it contracts—how could it possibly stretch out again? Instead, one should use one tael of ginseng, decoct it into a broth, and rinse with it for half a day. After completing the rinse with the ginseng broth, take three fen each of dragon&#39;s teeth powder and blood-resorption powder, and one qian each of ginseng and wheat beards, along with two fen of borneol, one dog, and ten earth worms. Roast these ingredients to a powder, place them on the ground for a moment to release their heat, and when the ginseng rinse is completed, dip your tongue into this powder, spreading it thoroughly. Do not retract your tongue into your mouth immediately; instead, keep it outside for half a moment. Endure until you can no longer stand it before retracting it back in. Repeat this process three times, and the tongue will be extended.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the tongue has a white coat, it indicates that the evil heat is not severe; use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to resolve it. If the tongue is yellow, it indicates heart heat; one can use Huang Lian and Zhi Zi to cool it. If the tongue is yellow with a grayish hue, this indicates stomach heat; use Shi Gao and Zhi Mu to cool it. If the tongue is yellow with a reddish tint, this indicates heat in the small intestine and bladder; Zhi Zi can be used to clear it. When the tongue is red with a white coating, it indicates lung heat; Huang Qin and Su Ye can be used to resolve it. If the tongue is black with a reddish tint, it indicates kidney deficiency with evil; use Sheng Di and Yuan Shen, adding Chai Hu to harmonize it. A red tongue with black spots indicates extreme stomach heat; Shi Gao should be used to treat it; Yuan Shen and Gan Ge can also be used, but they are not as effective as Shi Gao. A red tongue with white points signifies the presence of evil in the heart; use Chai Hu and Huang Lian to resolve it, treating both the heart and liver. A red tongue with large red spots indicates stomach heat with dampness; Yin Chen Wu Ling San should be used to promote urination. Water dampness must return to the bladder to disperse the evil, and only cinnamon can draw it into the bladder, but only a small amount should be used, not too much. A tongue that is coated white with black spots also indicates stomach heat; Shi Gao should be used to cool it.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the tongue is yellow with black spots, this indicates excess heat in the liver channel. Use Chai Hu (Bupleurum) and Zhi Zi (Gardenia) to relieve it. If the tongue is white with yellow, this suggests that the pathogen is about to enter the interior; urgently use Chai Hu and Zhi Zi to prevent it from entering the interior, as Chai Hu is a medicine that works both on the exterior and interior and is essential. If the tongue is white in the middle and yellow on the outside, this indicates that the pathogen has entered the large intestine; one must use Wu Ling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) to disperse water. Once the water is dispelled, the diarrhea will stop. If the tongue is yellow in the middle and white on the outside, this shows the pathogen is internal rather than external, upper rather than lower; one should add Chai Hu and Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange) to harmonize and relieve it, and should not abruptly use Da Huang (Rhubarb) for a harsh purge. Tian Shui (Heavenly Water) added to Wu Ling is also acceptable, but it is always better to use Chai Hu and Zhi Ke to directly address the root of the illness; adding a little Tian Shui is more appropriate, or if Tian Shui is not used, Wu Ling San can also be utilized. If the root of the tongue is yellow and glossy white, this indicates heat in the stomach coupled with dampness; one must use Shi Gao (Gypsum) as the principal ingredient, along with a small amount of Tian Shui products, such as Zhu Ling (Polyporus) or Ze Xie (Alisma). If the tongue has yellow spots separated by white, this indicates that damp pathogens have entered the large intestine, and one should promptly use Da Huang and Yin Chen (Virgate Wormwood) to clear it out without needing to use Di Dang or Shi Zao Tang (Ten Jujube Decoction). If the purging is slow, it cannot be used. One must also distinguish between water and blood; use Shi Zao for water, and Di Dang for blood. If the tongue shows red spots like worm bites, this indicates that water has not risen while fire intrudes; one must also use Huang Lian (Coptis) and Chai Hu to harmonize and relieve it.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

If the tongue has a black root and a pointed red tip, it indicates that evil in the kidney has not dissipated; Chai Hu and gardenia should be used to resolve it. If the tongue has a black root and a white tip, it indicates that stomach fire is affecting the kidney; gypsum, anemarrhena, and scrophularia should be used to resolve it, regardless of thirst or diarrhea. If the tongue has a black root and a yellow tip, evil is about to enter the kidney, and it is urgent to use rhubarb as a purgative. However, one must differentiate between painful and painless abdominal symptoms; if there is pain and the abdomen cannot be touched, it should be purged urgently, otherwise, only Chai Hu and gardenia should be used to harmonize and resolve it. If the tongue is uniformly red but the tip is black, it indicates kidney deficiency with evil fire invading; gypsum decoction should not be used. If the kidney is already deficient and gypsum is used, it leads to swift death. Instead, one should use one or two taels of scrophularia to save it, as many can survive. If the tongue shows a red center with pure black around the edges, it indicates the dual fires of the monarch and minister rising; urgent use of rhubarb with two portions of fresh earth should be administered to save it, and out of ten, five or six can be saved.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the kidney&#39;s essence is dried up and cannot be nourished, one should not use nourishing medicines such as cooked rehmannia at this time. This is because the pathogenic factors have not dispersed, and to replenish would only increase the distension and urgency, thus causing harm. It is essential to first expel the pathogens, after which one may use fresh rehmannia to nourish the kidney, but it should be used sparingly. If the tongue appears a pure gray with two black rings in the center, it indicates that the pathogen is about to invade the kidney. In that case, urgent use of a couple of burdock roots with a bit of bupleurum is required. If the tongue shows a red exterior but a black interior, this signifies extreme heat resembling water; one should urgently use bupleurum, gardenia, rhubarb, and bitter orange to harmonize and facilitate. If the tongue also has spikes, it indicates an extreme level of excessive heat, necessitating an increase in the aforementioned medicines. In general, if the interior is black and the exterior is white or yellow, those are similar signs and should be treated accordingly, allowing for a 50% chance of recovery. If the tongue is a light black with slight red or white on the exterior, or light yellow on the interior, this is a milder condition, and the previous methods can be applied, offering an 80% chance of recovery among ten individuals. If the tongue is purely red with a few black lines, this indicates water attacking fire, which is a yin syndrome; the tongue coating must be slippery, with aversions to cold and water, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Should a pure black tongue appear, that indicates a lethal condition, and no treatment is necessary. Water resembling fire and fire resembling water, both with a pure black hue, should not be treated.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tongue Gateway</strong></p>
<p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>When the tongue is covered with a white and smooth coating, rub it with fresh ginger dipped in honey, or wash it with ginger honey water. If the tongue coating is yellow, red, dry, or thick, take a new piece of blue cloth, wrap your finger, dip it in cold water, and rub it repeatedly. If it is mild, it can be easily removed; if severe, it is difficult to remove, and you must give a strong purge so that the fluids return and the coating will naturally retreat. </p>
<p>If there are sores on the tongue, or if the white coating is dry and thick like snow, affecting speech: mix equal parts of mint juice and white honey, blend and apply it. First, wash the tongue with thick slices of fresh ginger dipped in honey water, then apply the medication.</p>
<p>Another formula: wash with ginger honey water, then use a small amount of cinnabar, arsenic, borax, and musk powder mixed together and apply, which is also effective.</p>
<p>For treating the severed tongue: if an adult or child accidentally bites their tongue, severing it but leaving part still attached, use the soft skin of a chicken egg to wrap the tongue. Mix Xue Dan (blood-quickening) with honey and apply it to the root of the severed tongue. Then prepare a honey-wax mixture, adjusting the thickness as needed, and apply it on top of the chicken skin, as the softness helps the medicine penetrate. Keep applying it diligently; within three days, the tongue will reattach. After that, remove the chicken skin and continue applying the honey-wax mixture diligently for seven days until fully healed.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Formulas&quot; states: If there is swelling under the tongue, the person cannot speak. If the swelling is in the Yin Valley, saliva flows out even if the tongue is extended. In the Wind Mansion, the tongue is slow and cannot speak; if it is quick, words are difficult to form. The points of Fu Tu, Da Zhong, and Qiao Yin cause bleeding at the base of the tongue. If there is yellow on the tongue tip, the body feels hot. The point of Chi Ze causes a dry tongue and flank pain. Guan Chong causes a curled tongue, dry mouth, and feelings of distress. Zhong Chong indicates pain at the base of the tongue. Tian Tu shows a blue pulse at the tongue seam. Fu Liu causes a curled tongue that cannot speak. </p>
<p>When the tongue swells and overflows with saliva, resembling a blown-up pig bladder, and breath cannot pass, if not treated promptly, it can be fatal. One must urgently scrape both sides of the tongue with a finger to release the fluid, which will lead to recovery. Alternatively, a heated metal knife can be used to cut the sides and then apply wound ointment. Another method is to puncture both major vessels beneath the tongue, careful not to hit the central vessel, as that will cause uncontrollable bleeding and can be fatal. If the above treatments do not work or if the blood loss is substantial, heat a metal comb until red and use it to cauterize the wound several times to stem the bleeding. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jisheng Formulas&quot; states: for a quick tongue, treat the mute gate; for a slow tongue, treat the Wind Mansion. The &quot;Three Causes Formulas&quot; notes that swollen tongues typically have a parasitic worm underneath, resembling a mole cricket or a sleeping silkworm, with a head and a tail, the head being somewhat white.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ten Texts of Dongyuan&quot; states: The Lianquan point is also known as the &quot;root of the tongue,&quot; located beneath the jaw and above the throat. It treats conditions such as swelling under the tongue, difficulty in speaking, excessive saliva, locked mouth, urgent contraction of the root of the tongue, and difficulty swallowing food. The &quot;Discourse on Needle Techniques for Malaria&quot; mentions that the two vessels beneath the tongue refer to Lianquan. The &quot;Discourse on Forbidden Needles&quot; states that if one needles the vessels beneath the tongue excessively, the bleeding does not stop, leading to silence. The &quot;Discourse on Genuine Pathologies&quot; notes that blood will stop when taken from the Lianquan point, indicating that it is appropriate to draw blood and should avoid the use of a needle. </p>
<p>In response to the query about the two differing interpretations of where to needle the Lianquan point—one stating it is beneath the jaw and above the throat, while the other says it is at the two vessels beneath the tongue—what is correct? The answer is: The term &quot;root of the tongue&quot; refers to the base of the tongue. If one needles the two vessels beneath the tongue, they are targeting the tip of the tongue, which is incorrect. The correct location to needle is beneath the jaw, which corresponds to the root of the tongue.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Under the chin is where the Yangming channel operates. If one takes the two vessels under the tongue, they do not belong to the Yangming meridian. Wu and Gui combine, and Lianquan is associated with the foot Shaoyin, treating saliva below. It is explained that heat in the stomach overflows upwards, opening Lianquan, hence saliva must be discharged through bleeding to relieve the stomach heat. It is also understood that this does not refer to the two vessels under the tongue, as the swelling under the chin and above the throat is definitive. The &quot;Zhang Lun&quot; states that Lianquan and Yuye are the pathways of body fluids. According to the &quot;Needle Classic,&quot; Shaoyang is associated with Lianquan. Now, Yangming indicates diseases. The &quot;Effective Prescriptions&quot; states that if the tongue is swollen like a pig&#39;s bladder, one should use a needle to prick the large vessels on either side of the tongue; once blood flows out, it will immediately subside. Do not prick the central vessel, as bleeding that does not stop leads to death. If treating Yangming, use a heated copper chopstick to burn it, or apply vinegar mixed with herbal frost; it will quickly resolve.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

Use a coarse cotton needle to prick at the tip of a chopstick, applying it to the affected area to draw blood. If the redness and purpleness are mild, it&#39;s less severe; if it&#39;s darker and blackish, it indicates a more serious condition. For severe cases, several dozens of pricks may be necessary until the blood is drawn out, then rinse with warm water. In more serious cases, a gold key may be used; for lighter cases, use ice borax powder applied to the affected area to remove excess heat and saliva. Internally, one may take cooling herbs or drinks, which can be chosen as needed. For a swollen tongue that makes speech difficult: take points such as Lian Quan, Jin Jin, and Yu Ye to induce bleeding. Also consider Tian Tu, Shao Shang, Ran Gu, and Feng Fu.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the year of Hongzhi, in the year of the Yin Rooster (1491), Jiang Menghui from Jintai suffered from typhoid fever, his tongue completely black, and his hands and feet cold, unable to stop vomiting. The other doctors continued to treat him with heat methods, nearly leading to a critical situation. The judge, Wu Renzhai, administered the warming remedy Fuzi LI Zhong Tang, which cured him. The essence of medicine lies in using the right remedy for each illness. Fuzi treats cold; its effectiveness is considerable. How unfortunate it is that the world generally believes it to be a medicine that should not be used, preferring to let people die rather than save them. Isn’t it a pity! As for using medicine appropriately, results can vary, and one cannot casually dismiss it as utterly ineffective and abandon it.</p>
<p>When I was in the capital, Zheng Rudong&#39;s brother-in-law suffered from typhoid fever, his tongue completely black. The clinic&#39;s physician, Zeng Xi, suggested using Fuzi LI Zhong Tang, but everyone was alarmed and did not proceed. When he became extremely weak and preparations for his coffin began, Zeng returned to check on him, saying that using the previous medicine still had a chance for survival. His family had already resigned to his death, but they abandoned that thought and followed his suggestion, and after a few doses, he recovered. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, when the tongue is black, if it appears as if extreme fire resembles water, this aligns with what Scholar Du referred to when he spoke of fire becoming black charcoal, which calls for remedies like Liangge San to drain excess Yang. However, when water comes to conquer fire, this corresponds to what Physician Zeng treated, necessitating LI Zhong Tang to clear the Yin obstructions. It is also important to use mature ginger, sliced and gently rubbed on the tongue; if the color recedes a bit, it is treatable; if it remains stubborn and does not improve, it is not treatable.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

<p>A wealthy individual suffered from tongue pain, utilizing topical and medicinal desensitizing agents, yet the tongue was swelling acutely. I punctured the tip of the tongue and both sides, releasing about a cup of purple blood, causing slight reduction of swelling; after administering one dose of rhinoceros horn and rehmannia decoction, it swelled again the next morning. I punctured it once more, releasing about a cup of purple blood, and the swelling diminished again; yet, after a long time, the tongue was swelling significantly. I then punctured to release about two cups of black blood, with gradual reduction of swelling. Suddenly, he experienced chills and fever, nausea, headaches, and a floating, rapid pulse; although the pathogen had departed, the true qi was increasingly damaged. I treated with a formula to tonify qi, doubling the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, and after four doses he stabilized, with several additional doses resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman was prone to anger, and her tongue was swollen and caused discomfort. After using medications to reduce heat and transform phlegm, her symptoms worsened, with tension in her sides and abdominal bloating. Her menstrual flow did not cease. The diagnosis indicated a deficiency in the liver&#39;s ability to store blood and a deficiency in the spleen&#39;s ability to manage blood. Treatment with an enhanced version of the Gui Pi decoction, adding Mai Men Dong and Five Flavor Herb, led to recovery. If her condition arose from violent anger, a prescription of Xiao Chai Hu decoction with Dan Pi and Shan Zhi was used. In cases of blood deficiency, Ba Zhen Tang was modified with Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Dan Pi, and if the deficiency was severe, Pao Jiang would be added.</p>
<p>A man presented with tightness under the tongue, numbness in the thumb and index fingers, and either constipation or skin redness. This indicated wind-heat and blood deficiency of the large intestine, which improved with the use of Xiao Yao San supplemented with Huai Jiao and Qin Jiao.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a cerebral abscess in winter, experiencing swelling, pain, heat, and thirst, with a rapid and forceful pulse. The condition was alleviated with a cooling and detoxifying powder for ulceration. In March of the following year, she had severe swelling of the tongue and developed numerous purple sores all over her body resembling grapes, particularly on her hands and feet. After incising these to release black blood and taking seven pills of Da Ming Dan, she experienced a foul sweat, with the sores worsening and constipation persisting for two days. A combination of Da Huang, Qing, and Lian at three qian each, along with Sheng Ma, Bai Zhi, Shan Zhi, Bo He, Lian Qiao at two qian each, and one qian of raw Gan Cao, was boiled in water and taken. This led to a significant release of foul blood in both excretions, and her condition slightly improved. Then, the powdered mixture was combined with Rhinoceros horn juice for further consumption, leading to foul blood discharge from both the root of the tongue and the gaps between her teeth, ultimately resolving the toxicity.

Zhou Zhen witnessed this and had her imitate childbirth, with the support of two women. A basin was placed outside on the wall, and when it fell and made a noise, her tongue retracted.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Medical Texts&quot; mentions: Wang Kuan treated a wealthy merchant who, due to fright, extended his tongue and could not retract it. For ten days, he could not swallow food, and he became extremely weak; the national physicians could not heal him.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Formulations Examination&quot; states: There was a person with a swollen tongue, extending outside the mouth, and no one dared to treat him. A villager said that he happened to have this medicine; he went home to fetch it, which turned out to be two pieces of paper twisted into a wick. He burned it with a lamp to create smoke, which he then used to fumigate the tongue, and it immediately reduced in size. When asked about the method, the villager replied: In my family, we used to have an ox that also had a swollen tongue. People advised using castor oil soaked in paper twisted into a wick, burning it to fumigate, and it cured the ox, so I used it on people as well, and it proved effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states: When I was in Yandu, I once treated a man named Wang who suffered from kidney deficiency due to cold damage at the age of thirty. His tongue was very black, with prickles dried and cracked, charred black like coal. He had a fever, constipation, intense thirst preferring cold, but his pulse was weak, and his spirit was dull. Many doctors said he had a yang condition with an阴 pulse and would surely die. However, I observed that his form and vitality had not yet escaped, so I administered large doses of sweet warming tonics to strengthen his foundation, while intermittently using cool water to nourish his exterior. Water is the essence of Heaven&#39;s oneness; the cool can relieve heat, and sweetness can help the阴, unlike the bitter cold that damages the vital energy. Therefore, even in cases of dry fluids, yin deficiency, and intense heat with thirst, it should not be avoided.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From this, both the water and medicine were administered together. In total, they used one to two pounds of ginseng and cooked rehmannia, several liang of aconite and cinnamon, and one to two dou of cold water. Gradually, the various symptoms receded, food intake increased, and both spirit and energy were restored. However, upon examining the tongue, if it remained black, there was no reduction at all. I was greatly perplexed and unable to find an explanation. After a few more days, the black coating on the tongue shed, revealing bright new flesh underneath. It became clear that the skin and pores were scorched and had died but then revived. Without significant nourishment, how could there be a rebirth? This particular case is noted as an extreme example. Furthermore, there are countless instances where a black tongue was treated with tonics and preserved. Therefore, when diagnosing febrile diseases, one should discern between internal and external cold and heat based on the color of the tongue. If one were to differentiate between deficiency and excess based on this, mistakes could not be avoided. Indeed, excess can lead to a black tongue from excessive fire causing scorching; deficiency can also lead to a black tongue from water deficiency causing withering. If both yellow and black tongues are entirely considered as signs of excess heat, then there is no chance for a diagnosis of yin deficiency.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

For lung heat diseases, one first experiences a shivery sensation, the hair rising, and a dislike of wind and cold; the tongue appears yellow and the body feels warm.

Symptoms like discomfort at the root of the tongue and vomiting during meals are illnesses caused by the spleen channel. Frequent belching signifies that the spleen qi ascends to the heart.

If Zang Jie presents without yang symptoms, showing no alternation of cold and heat, and the person remains still with a slippery tongue coating, it should not be attacked. **Tongue Treatise** The tongue reflects the heart and the status of the small intestine. A tongue weighs ten ounces, measures seven inches in length, and two and a half inches in width. It is adept at assessing and can balance the five flavors. When eating, if one consumes too much salt, the tongue pulse becomes congealed and discolored; too much bitterness leads to a dry appearance of the tongue's surface; too much spiciness causes the tongue muscles to tighten and the edges to become dry; too much sourness makes the tongue flesh swell and the lips reveal; too much sweetness results in pain at the root of the tongue and loss of its outer surface. It is noted that the heart desires bitterness, the lungs desire spiciness, the liver desires sourness, the spleen desires sweetness, and the kidneys desire salt—these five flavors correspond to the qi of the five organs. If the organs are heated, the tongue develops sores, and the lips are revealed and red; if the bowels are cold, the tongue's base retracts, and the mouth is tight with blue lips. Cold should be supplemented, heat should be drained; when neither cold nor heat is present, adjustments should be made based on the organs.

The heart's main vessel is connected to the root of the tongue, while the spleen's network connects to the sides of the tongue. The liver's vessels circulate through the tongue's base, and the kidneys' fluids come out at the tongue's tip, distributing to the five organs, under the heart's control. If the three meridians are affected by the four Qi, the tongue may curl and be unable to speak; if the seven emotions are stagnant, the tongue may swell and be unable to articulate. For instance, if heat in the heart causes the tongue to ulcerate, obstruction in the liver may lead to bleeding like a surge, and blockage in the spleen may cause a white coating reminiscent of snow. These are the disorders of the tongue. The heart's energy connects to the tongue, and harmony in the heart enables the discernment of five tastes; the spleen's energy connects to the mouth, and harmony in the spleen allows for the recognition of the flavors of grains. ### Heavy Tongue For a heavy tongue, first rinse with cool water, then chew fresh peppermint leaves (five to seven leaves), followed by thoroughly chewing a piece of the Holy Golden Essence until it is extremely fine, then swallow with well water.

Additionally, if there is external swelling of the tongue, it is referred to as \"heavy tongue,\" treated with a powder of true Puhuang. There are also cases where the tongue is inexplicably numb, which should not be treated as wind; instead, it is due to insufficient heart blood and can be addressed with a modified Lizhong Decoction by adding half a qian of熟附子 (prepared Aconite) and half a qian of Angelica. **Introduction to Medicine** The connection of the five organs to the tongue is as follows: the heart's primary vessels are attached at the root of the tongue, the spleen's collateral vessels are connected to the sides of the tongue, the liver's vessels run along the yin organs and connect at the base of the tongue, and the kidney’s fluids emerge at the tip of the tongue, distributing moisture to the five organs, with the heart primarily governing this.

The \"Ling Shu\" also mentions that the foot Taiyin, when active, causes tongue root stiffness, and illnesses arising will result in pain at the tongue root. Additionally, if the sublingual pulse is excessively needled, bleeding may occur, leading to muteness. The sublingual pulse is the spleen pulse; muteness refers to the inability to speak. Furthermore, Sun Jingsi stated: The tongue is governed by the heart’s qi and is connected to the spleen pulse. If the two organs are imbalanced, wind pathogens can invade, causing the tongue to stiffen and hinder speech, while phlegm heat attacks, leading to swelling and the inability to articulate. There are also symptoms such as heavy tongue, stiff tongue, tongue swelling, and bleeding, all resulting from the invasion of wind and heat on the heart and spleen channels. Additionally, it is also associated with the foot Yangming stomach meridian. **Note:** Zhang Jifeng stated: The spleen and stomach govern the four limbs, their pulses connecting to the root of the tongue and linking to the lips and mouth. The stomach is the sea of fluids, the spleen processes and digests them, whereby the essence of these fluids transforms into nutrient defenses to nourish the four limbs. If one fails to maintain proper living habits or eats at irregular times, it leads to insufficient spleen and stomach qi, resulting in poor nourishment for defense, allowing wind pathogens to invade, causing paralysis of both the limbs and the lips, resulting in slurred speech. If untreated for a long time, it could develop into atrophy. The classics state that treating atrophy should focus on the Yangming system, namely the foot Yangming, and the treatment should emphasize the use of spleen and stomach remedies while minimizing medications to dispel wind for stability. Additionally, it also belongs to the foot Shaoyin kidney meridian."},{"anchor":"trans-29p","marker":"29p","type":"translation","text":"**Phlegm Bag** The phlegm bag is caused by phlegm and fluid rising with heat, condensing under the tongue, forming a soft, swollen mass similar to a gourd, which affects speech and causes pain and discomfort.

He shook her, and when she asked what was the matter, he did not respond. He shook her again, and she looked at him in surprise, only to find her tongue swollen and filling her mouth, unable to speak. They urgently sought a doctor, who arrived carrying a pouch of medicine and mixed it for her, and by morning she had returned to her original condition. When asked, he revealed it was cattail pollen. Kun comments that \"The inner canon\" states: Excess heat causes swelling. This condition must arise from the combined fire of the heart and spleen affecting the tongue, causing swelling and filling the mouth. Cattail pollen is cold in nature and can clear qi and cool the blood, hence it cured her. In cases of heat syndrome, there is often protrusion of the tongue. When one recovers yet the tongue cannot retract, use a bit of borneol, grind it into powder, and apply it to the tongue, and then it can retract. The reason for the tongue's protrusion is that heat is truly present inside, and it seeks to expel the tongue to release qi; the reason it cannot retract is that the pathogenic qi has long been lodged, making the tongue stiff and not pliable. Borneol is spicy and warming but has a clear fragrance, which can open the orifices, soften the tendons, and release qi. Thus, with its application, the tongue retracts. There are instances of swollen tongues that extend outward where no one dares to treat them."},{"anchor":"trans-31p","marker":"31p","type":"translation","text":"A villager said: Occasionally there is this medicine; I returned home to fetch it, and found it to be two pieces of paper twisted into wicks. I burned them with a lamp to let the smoke waft over my tongue, and it immediately reduced the swelling. When others inquired about the method, the villager replied: In my family, there was an old cow whose tongue also became swollen and protruded. People taught to use castor oil to soak the paper wicks, burn them, and let the smoke treat it, which proved effective. Kun remarked: When the tongue is swollen and protruding, it is said that heat overwhelms and causes the swelling. The tongue is the seed of the heart, and the spleen's meridians are connected to the root of the tongue. Thus, the heat should be attributed to the heart and spleen meridians. The \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" states: Castor oil is effective for edema and eliminating foul gas; applying oil based on the leaves can alleviate wind swelling and numbness when pounded and steamed for application, which shows it can relieve internal heat from wind swelling. However, the use of its smoke has a subtle meaning: smoke is a light and clear substance; once it enters the mouth, it can be transmitted and transformed through breathing, allowing it to reach directly to the heart and spleen. It not only addresses the symptoms but can also treat the root cause. The villager used it without understanding the principle; that is why he remains a villager.

Generally, true heat causing blackness will also show signs of red, purple, dry mouth, or several prickling sensations; if the black is deep with little red and is smooth, it does not indicate true heat. Conversely, if the six pulses are thin and weak, accompanied by a feeling of fatigue and depletion, this indicates a state of deficiency, suggesting that cold water is obstructing the heart's fire and not returning to its original state. Merely treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause guarantees an unsuccessful treatment. The treatment method: If the heat within is not severe and there’s still some unresolved exterior issue, one should use drinks like Chai Hu decoctions to resolve the exterior; if the internal heat is quite severe, use remedies like Liang Ge San or Xijiao Dihuang Tang to clear the interior.

If the tongue has a white coating and speech is slurred, one should use mint and white honey combined with ginger slices to apply and rub onto it. The tongue is the organ of the heart, normally red and moist. After three or four days of cold damage, if the tongue has a coating, it will inevitably turn from moist to dry, from slippery to rough, from white to yellow, from yellow to black, and even scorched dry, or develop pricking sensations; all these are signs of evil heat transmitting from the superficial to the deeper layers. Therefore, when the pathogenic qi is in the exterior, the tongue will not have a coating; when it transmits to the interior, the fluids become dry, leading to tongue coating formation. If the pathogenic influence is still not deep, existing between the exterior and interior, or if the pathogenic qi is lodged in the chest, the coating will not be black or rough, and one should only use formulas like Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to harmonize it. If the yang pathogens penetrate the interior, causing heat in the stomach, the tongue coating will be rough rather than slippery, necessitating formulas such as Zhi Zi Chi Decoction to clear it.

It may be treated either by clearing it or by mildly purging. The \"Essentials from the Golden Coffer\" states: if the tongue is yellow but not purged, then purging will cause the yellow to disappear on its own. However, one must ensure that the stool is dry and firm, the pulse is deep, strong, and there is great thirst to consider purging. If there is only slight thirst, the pulse is weak, the stool is not hard, and the coating is not dry and prickly, purging is not appropriate. If the tongue has a black coating with prickles, the heat is even more intense, and it is advisable to use cooling medicines such as Liangge Powder, Chengqi Decoction, or Da-Chaihu Decoction accordingly. If the coating is black and slippery but not scorched, it indicates an absence of real pathogenic factors and is not a sign of fire; in this case, purging or attempting to clear it would not only be inappropriate but also harmful. This is a general differentiation based on the tongue, and while it is stated this way, there are still cases that do not fit neatly into these categories; therefore, careful examination is recommended as discussed below. It is noted in various treatises on febrile diseases that the heart is the sovereign organ, opening to the tongue. The heart governs fire, and the kidney governs water; black, being the color of water, appearing in the heart region indicates a conflict leading to death.

Is it because of overcoming that one must die? We must examine the root of the condition carefully. If there is black color touching the ground and looking gray and dull, its source is already ruined, and death is certain. However, if the tongue appears scorched and black but the texture is red and lively, it is not necessarily a sign of death. When yang energy is strong, it clears the stomach fire; if the fire recedes, healing will occur, so there is no need for concern! If there is great loss of vital energy and only yin pathogens are present, the color will also be yellow-black. If true water has dried up, the tongue will be dry and scorched as well. When both water and fire in the kidneys are deficient, it is not a sign of real heat. To discern this, one must observe the shape, energy, pulse, and color; the distinctions between deficiency and excess will become apparent, guiding one to tonify or clear accordingly, much like the difference between ice and fire. Therefore, anything that is scorched, dry, and withered may not indicate real heat or fire. Furthermore, if someone appears dark and lacking vitality but moist and not dry, it indicates that water is overcoming fire, which is a sign of deficiency-cold. Mistaking this for fire and administering bitter cold remedies would extinguish what little remains. Thus, for all such conditions, one must thoroughly investigate the pulse and symptoms, prioritizing deficiency and excess, rather than hastily concluding that the blackened appearance solely signifies clearing out heat!

There are also malevolent forces that may be involved. A proper method is to take a small amount of borneol, place it inside a clam shell, and it will immediately dissolve into water. Then, a goose feather should be used to apply it on the sore; it can quickly be absorbed into the tongue, enabling eating and drinking again. The clam is an extremely Yin substance, so it attacks Yin-related evils, causing them to retreat. Furthermore, the pungent warmth of borneol helps drive out evils vigorously, ensuring success with little effort. Sores on the tongue signify the presence of heat from the heart, and since the tongue is associated with the heart, it’s first seen as a connection.

This is why the results are as immediate as the sound of a drum.

舌为心之官，本红而泽。凡伤寒三四日已后，舌上有胎必自润而燥，自滑而濇，由白而黄，由黄而黑，甚至焦干，或生芒刺，是皆邪热内传由浅入深之证也。故凡邪气在表，舌则无胎，及其传里，则津液干燥而舌胎生矣。若邪犹未深，其在半表半里之间，或邪气客于胸中者，其胎不黑不濇，止宜小柴胡之属以和之。若阳邪传里，胃中有热，则舌胎不滑而濇，宜栀子豉汤之属以清之。若烦躁欲饮水数升者，白虎加人参汤之类主之。"},{"anchor":"orig-34p","marker":"34p","type":"original","text":"大都舌上黄胎而焦濇者，胃腑有邪热也，或清之或微下之。《金匮要略》曰：舌黄未下者，下之黄自去。然必大便燥实，脉沉有力而大渴者，方可下之。若微渴而脉不实，便不坚，胎不干燥芒刺者，不可下也。其有舌上黑胎而生芒刺者，则热更甚矣，宜凉膈散、承气汤、大柴胡之属酌宜下之。若胎色虽黑滑而不濇者，便非实邪，亦非火证，非惟不可下，且不可清也。此辨舌之概，虽云若此，然犹有不可概论者，仍宜详察如左。
