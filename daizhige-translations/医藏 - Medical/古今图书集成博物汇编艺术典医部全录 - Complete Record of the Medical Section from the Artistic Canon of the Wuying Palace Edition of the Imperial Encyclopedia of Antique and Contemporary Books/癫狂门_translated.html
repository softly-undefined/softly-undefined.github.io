<p><strong>On Madness</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>A General Analysis of the Theory of Void and Substance</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What is the nature of madness? Qi Bo replied: The pulse is large and slippery, persisting for a long time; if the pulse is small, firm, and rapid, it indicates death without treatment. The Emperor asked: What is the nature of the pulse in cases of madness, in terms of void and substance? Qi Bo replied: If it is void, it can be treated; if it is substantial, it leads to death.<br>[Note: A large pulse indicates abundant energy outward; a small, firm, and rapid pulse indicates energy leaking downward.]</p>
<p><strong>On Unusual Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What is the name of the illness that causes madness in a person? How does one acquire it? Qi Bo replied: It is termed a fetal disease. This is acquired while in the mother’s womb, when the mother experiences a sudden shock, causing the energy to rise rather than descend, and thus the vital essence remains entangled, resulting in the child developing madness.<br>[Note: A sudden shock causes energy to violently rise without descending. As the essence nourishes the fetus and remains entangled, if the mother is startled and her energy rises, then the child&#39;s vital essence also goes awry, leading to madness.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of the Pulse</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>When clothing does not cover the body, and speech of good and evil does not avoid relationships of kinship or distance, this is a disruption of the divine spirit. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: When the Yangming condition is severe, one abandons clothing to run, climbs high to sing, and may go days without food, leaping over walls and rooftops—what enables this, which is beyond their usual capability? Qibo replied: The limbs are the root of all Yang; when Yang is abundant, the limbs are robust, and when robust, one is capable of climbing high. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What causes one to abandon clothing and run? Qibo replied: It is due to excessive heat in the body, which compels one to shed clothes and desire to run. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about those who speak wildly and insult, not avoiding relations of kinship or distance, and sing? Qibo replied: When Yang is abundant, it causes one to speak wildly and insult without regard for kinship, and to have no desire for food, which leads to wild running. </p>
<p>This is because the stomach channel connects to the heart; when Yang is abundant, the spirit becomes confused, hence causing such wild speech and insults, disregarding kinship. If heat is abundant in the stomach, it leads to a lack of desire for food, thus causing wild running. This is because the limbs receive energy from the stomach.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Yangming</strong> </p>
<p>In Yangming syndrome, there are symptoms of mania with a desire to run and shout, abdominal fullness leading to inability to lie down, and a flushed, hot face accompanied by delusional sights and speech. [Note: The mania, shouting, delusional speech and sights are diseases of the Yangming channel. The qi of the channels is reversed, resulting in abdominal fullness. The stomach is not harmonized, causing inability to lie down. Yangming is a channel characterized by dryness and heat; hence, the qi of the channel rises to the face, resulting in a flushed and hot appearance.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on Qi Exchange and Transformation</strong></p>
<p>When the fire of the year is excessive, it affects the lesser Yin and lesser Yang above, leading to diseases characterized by delirium and mania. <em>[Note: The influence on the lesser Yin and lesser Yang intensifies the fire, causing extreme delirium and mania.]</em> The rapid pulse of the kidneys results in bone epilepsy. <em>[Note: The kidneys are the Yin organ that governs the bones; excessive Yin cold can lead to bone epilepsy.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Great Treatise on the Five Constants and Governance</strong></p>
<p>During the auspicious time of the rising sun, the illness manifests as laughter and mania. <em>[Note: When the heart Qi is strong, it leads to incessant laughter and mania, which are symptoms of heat-related illness.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on the Manifestation of the Five Qi</strong></p>
<p>When evil enters Yang, it results in mania; if it clashes with Yang, it leads to epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on Yin and Yang Classification</strong></p>
<p>When the two Yin and two Yang converge, the illness resides in the kidneys, marked by cursing and erratic behavior; epilepsy manifests as mania. <em>[Note: The convergence refers to the energies of the two Yin and two Yang channels merging and rising to the Yangming; illness in the kidneys implies a deficiency in kidney Qi and semen, causing its deficiency Qi to rush upwards. When the pathogenic Qi transmits to Yangming, it leads to cursing and erratic behavior, and epilepsy manifests as mania.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on Vital Qi Connecting to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Yin is responsible for storing essence and activating, while Yang guards the exterior and provides firmness. If Yin cannot manage its Yang, the pulse becomes weak and illness ensues, leading to mania. <em>[Note: Excessive Yang results in mania; the illness arises from excessive Yang itself, hence it leads to mania.]</em><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>The Essential Discussion on Absolute Truth</h3>
<p>All madness and frenzy belong to fire.<br><em>[Note: Fire refers to the yang fire of the Lesser Yang.]</em></p>
<h3>Treatise on Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The excessive yang of the taiyang (Greater Yang) leads to mania and peak illness, where yang is fully above, and yin is below; the lower part is empty while the upper part is solid, hence the mania and peak illness.<br><em>[Note: Mania and peak illness occur because the yang energy is excessively above while the yin energy is below, unable to harmonize with the yang; thus, the lower part is hollow and the upper part is substantial, resulting in mania and peak illness.]</em></p>
<p>The yangming (Greater Brightness) states that when sickness reaches a peak, one feels inclined to ascend high and sing, discarding clothing and running away; this is due to the struggle between yin and yang, with the external façade contending with the yang, causing such behavior.<br><em>[Note: The struggle between yin and yang refers to the yin and yang energies being thin and fighting within and without. When the yin energy gathers externally with the yang, the excess of yang leads to illness. The prevalence of yang prompts the person to ascend high, sing, discard clothing, and run.]</em></p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Collapse</h3>
<p>The liver transfers cold to the heart, leading to mania and blockage in the middle.<br><em>[Note: The liver is a yang organ, with wood and fire governing qi; yang is associated with yang, hence the mania. The heart resides above the diaphragm, while the liver is positioned below; the energy between the mother and child connects up and down. The liver pathology ascends to the heart and remains below it, resulting in blockage in the middle.]</em><br><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>On Regulating Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>Blood converges in Yin, and Qi converges in Yang, which leads to agitation and madness.<br><em>[Note: Blood converging in Yin results in excessive Yin and substantial blood; the heart governs blood vessels, thus excessive Yin leads to agitation. Qi converging in Yang results in excessive Yang and substantial Qi; excessive Yang leads to madness.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What causes the illness of anger and madness? Qi Bo replied: It arises from Yang. The Emperor asked: How does Yang cause madness? Qi Bo replied: Yang Qi is difficult to resolve when it is violently upset, hence it is prone to anger; this condition is named Yang Jue. The Emperor asked: How can it be treated? Qi Bo replied: The Yangming stage is always in motion, while Ju Yang and Shao Yang are at rest; when they do not move but emotions surge, it results in severe illness, which is the manifestation. The Emperor asked: How is it treated? Qi Bo replied: Simply depriving it of food will suffice. Food enters Yin, nourishing Qi in Yang, therefore depriving it of food will be enough. Have the patient drink a decoction made from raw iron filings. Raw iron filings are used for descending Qi sickness.<br><em>[Note: Ju Yang refers to the heart&#39;s aspect of Yang, while Shao Yang refers to the liver&#39;s aspect of Qi; both are at rest. Yangming represents the vigorous Qi of the stomach, thus it alone is continuously active. Now, when the resting Qi becomes mobilized, it results in severe illness, provoking anger and madness. The Qi of food enters the stomach, dispersing essence to the liver, while turbid Qi returns to the heart, producing disorder in the vessels, with fine vessels gathering essence, circulating Qi in the bowels; hence food enters Yin and nurtures Qi in Yang. Now, the Qi of the liver and heart is ascending, causing the movement of Ju Yang and Shao Yang to lead to severe illness, therefore depriving it of food allows Yin Qi to weaken and Yang movement to cease.]</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Symptoms of Disease Caused by Pathogenic Factors in the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The lung meridian, when excessively urgent, leads to madness.<br>[Note: The lung governs the clearing of metal and fears cold; severe cold results in madness, hence the saying &quot;heavy yin leads to madness.&quot;]</p>
<p><strong>On the Spirit of the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The lung flourishes in limitless joy, but excessive joy injures the corporeal soul. When the corporeal soul is injured, one becomes mad; those who are mad have no sense of self. The skin becomes parched, hair falls out, and the complexion becomes wan, leading to death in summer.<br>[Note: Limitless joy is an emotion of the heart. If limitless joy injures the corporeal soul of the lung, then the injury leads to madness. The &quot;intention&quot; refers to the manifestations of the heart; when joy is limitless, the spirit becomes scattered and cannot remain. The lung governs the skin and hair, thus the skin becomes parched.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Meridian Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The stomach meridian of the foot Yangming causes, when active, illness characterized by chills and a scattered feeling, a propensity to groan and frequent yawning, a dark complexion, and when illness strikes, aversion to dark places and fire, and a startle response to wooden sounds. The heart feels restless, leading one to shut doors and windows and remain enclosed. In severe cases, there is a desire to ascend and sing, to cast off clothing and run. Distention and rumbling of the abdomen signal a state known as &quot;knee constriction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Yangming corresponds to midday, and when in the presence of Yin energy, chills and a scattered sensation occur. The tendency to groan reflects a Yang energy that is suppressed and seeking to express itself. Frequent yawning indicates a yearning upward of Yang. A dark complexion points to an excess of Yin above. When illness arrives, it affects the meridians. Among the diseases of the Yangming meridian, there is a dislike for dark places and fire; the sound of wood startles. The stomach network connects upward to the heart, hence the heart&#39;s unrest. The interaction of Yin and Yang leads to a desire to remain enclosed. When Yang is abundant, the limbs feel firm, and the urge to climb and sing arises. An excess of heat causes one to discard clothing and run. The Yangming meridian&#39;s obstruction leads to rumbling and distension linked to the stomach and spleen network.</p>
<p>The bladder meridian of the foot Taiyang primarily governs illnesses arising from the tendons, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, and seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Yang energy nurtures the tendons when mild, which results in conditions like hemorrhoids. If the meridians are deficient internally, it may lead to malaria. Reversal below can manifest as seizures or madness.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>The Madness Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The outer canthus of the eye, which slants outward, is called the &quot;sharp canthus,&quot; while the inner canthus, which is closer to the nose, is called the &quot;inner canthus.&quot; The upper part corresponds to the outer canthus, and the lower part corresponds to the inner canthus. [Note: The energy of the Taiyin is constrained; the outer corner represents the sharp canthus, and the inner corner represents the inner canthus, signifying the Taiyin energy governing the external and internal canthi of the eye. The Sun represents the upper part of the eye, and the Yangming represents the lower part; thus the upper part is the outer canthus, and the lower part is the inner canthus, indicating the energy of the Sun and Yangming governing the upper and lower aspects of the eye.]</p>
<p>In cases of madness stemming from bone-related ailments, there are symptoms such as the teeth and flesh around the joints being full while the bones are empty, with profuse sweating and anxiety, frequent vomiting of frothy saliva, and a downward flow of energy that cannot be treated. [Note: The teeth are remnants of bone, and the flesh corresponds to the bone; hence, in cases of madness linked to the bones, the teeth and surrounding flesh are abundant, while the bones are lacking in connection. The excessive sweating and anxiety stem from a disease affecting the Kidney of the Lesser Yin from the foot, which ascends to influence the Heart of the Lesser Yin in the hand. The frequent vomiting of frothy saliva indicates a derangement of Taiyin and Yangming energies. The downward flow of energy signifies leakage from the Lesser Yin. The separation of Yin and Yang in an upward and downward manner results in an incurable condition.]</p>
<p>Those who suffer from madness, if their affliction appears frantic, will not be saved from death.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Note: Excess in yin leads to mania, while excess in yang leads to delirium. When the disease starts suddenly like mania, both yin and yang qi are harmed, resulting in death without treatment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinction Between Mania and Delirium</strong></p>
<p>The twentieth difficulty states: Excess yang leads to mania, while excess yin leads to delirium. When lacking yang, one perceives ghosts; when lacking yin, one becomes blind. The fifty-ninth difficulty states: How can one distinguish between mania and delirium? Indeed, in the onset of mania, there is little sleep and lack of hunger, an attitude of superiority and discernment, an air of arrogance, excessive laughter and enjoyment of music, ceaseless wandering; these are the signs. At the onset of delirium, one feels no joy, appears stiff and stares blankly; their pulse shows both yin and yang are excessively strong.</p>
<p><strong>Jin Kui Yao Lue</strong> (by Zhang Ji of the Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Delirium</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on the five zang states: If the evil cry causes the spirit to be unsettled, it signifies a deficiency of blood and qi. A deficiency in blood and qi relates to the heart. When the heart qi is deficient, the person feels fearful, desires sleep with closed eyes, dreams of distant travels, and the spirit is scattered, causing the soul to wander. A decline in yin qi leads to delirium, while a decline in yang qi leads to mania. The chapter on phlegm and fluids states: If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel, spits foam, and becomes delirious and dizzy, this is due to water, and it is governed by Wu Ling San.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>&quot;The Heart and Mind Teachings&quot; (Han - Hua Tuo)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madness</strong></p>
<p>The illness that arises from the six viscera is associated with the Yang energies. It may manifest in various ways: sometimes outwardly, sometimes inwardly, sometimes disrupted, or sometimes in the extremes. Some individuals can sing and laugh, while others can weep; some may run about, and others may sigh; some may exhibit twisted postures, while others consider themselves noble. Some are awake yet cannot sleep; others may lose their ability to speak but make sounds without meaning. Each case is different, but all arise from the six viscera. If one finds joy in their condition, treat them accordingly; if their condition is blocked, address the block; if they enjoy water, provide water; if they find comfort in coolness, then provide coolness. The pleasure and preferences of the patient should not be opposed nor forcibly restrained. By following this principle, healing can be found in all cases, ten times for ten individuals, hundreds for hundreds—no ailment remains that cannot be cured. </p>
<p>Symptoms of heart disturbance may involve excessive sweating, a desire to lie flat without moving or turning, and speaking with delusions. For such patients, it is advisable to apply moxibustion to the heart. If the lips and face show varied colors—blue, white, yellow, black, or red—and if the eyes are unable to settle, while the heart is critically weakened, then there is no hope for recovery, and after five days, death is inevitable.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>The Pulse of Madness</h3>
<p>The Heart Pulse Song says: &quot;Three sections correspond to the fever of the heart, sores arise on the tongue, lips tear apart. Wild words fill the eyes, seeing ghosts and gods, drinking water by the hundred cups, never stopping.&quot; </p>
<p>The Tight Pulse Song says: &quot;The tight pulse at three gates counts the strings, the incoming wind is the root source. Suddenly, mad words cause fear, without encountering a good doctor, recovery is impossible.&quot; </p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Diseases of Life and Death Song says: &quot;The disease of confusion leads to madness, yet the pulse is firm and safe. At the inch and cun positions, it feels heavy and fine, as such, I have not heard of anyone saved.&quot;</p>
<h3>Treatment for Madness</h3>
<p>Xu Sibai said: &quot;In my youth, I inherited the family business and studied classical formulas, hearing from famous doctors regarding treatments. I believe dizziness caused by wind is multifactorial; many schools do not guarantee efficacy, and on this technique, my humble opinion is particularly focused. I have used it recently, with no missed strategies. This year, as I face decline, I fear it may abruptly take me, hence I clearly discuss it for future reference. </p>
<p>The disease of dizziness arises from unstable heart qi, with accumulation in the chest, hence it is caused by high winds and heated faces. When phlegm and heat interact, it stirs up wind; when wind and heart are in disarray, it causes confusion—hence the term wind dizziness. In adults, it is termed madness, while in children, it is classified as epilepsy, yet fundamentally, they are one and the same.</p>
<p>This prescription for treatment is guaranteed to cure; however, fears may arise from misdiagnosis or misalignment. Generally, avoid eating flesh from the twelve classifications; pig meat causes issues, leading to excessive gas and urgency, which can lead to inevitable death. Thus, this one decoction is appropriate for conditions of lightness and heaviness; do not hastily label it as an ineffective remedy.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The Wind-Confounding Decoction pills should be decocted with ten ingredients in total. For an ordinary person experiencing an onset, it is advisable to administer the Reviving Decoction urgently. In times of distress, simply using moxibustion on the acupuncture points, then treating with fire needles, will lead to full recovery. After achieving results with acupuncture, it is best to proceed with moxibustion; the methods for moxibustion are detailed afterward. In my thirty years of practice, I have saved dozens or hundreds of lives, all of whom recovered completely. Future generations who understand this formula should not mix it with my other techniques.</p>
<p>All diseases caused by hundreds of evils originate from various paths, exhibiting numerous forms. These conditions may manifest as signs of chaotic disturbances, with some individuals remaining silent, while others speak incessantly or babble, singing or crying, chanting or laughing, sleeping in ditches, consuming filth, or exposing themselves. Some may wander about day and night, rage without restraint, or exhibit signs of insect-like spirits, appearing frantic and agitated. For such types of madness, acupuncture and moxibustion, along with herbal remedies, should be the main treatments. Those who are under the influence of wind should also conclude that it is the wind that causes the madness. </p>
<p>When wind enters the Yang channels, it causes craziness; when it enters the Yin channels, it causes epilepsy.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The harmful effects of wind on those who have been suffering for a long time can lead to joint pain and result in madness; this must not be overlooked. Throughout history, regardless of wealth or status, many have suffered from this. This is the toxicity of wind, and while there are remedies such as herbal medicine, they do not compare to the efficacy of pine resin or pine spirit. For those who are traveling and cannot afford immediate treatment, it is advisable to take various herbal decoctions, which are better than no treatment at all, but it is also beneficial to apply moxibustion at painful areas with three-seven moxa. </p>
<p>In cases of madness, there is a desire to escape or a tendency to claim oneself as a sage or divine being, which requires moxibustion for effective treatment and the possibility of a lasting cure. However, if there is sorrowful crying or moaning, this is caused by a pathogen rather than madness, and one should treat it according to the specific affliction. When pathogens invade the yang, it leads to madness; when they invade the yin, it results in stasis of blood. A pathogen entering the yang manifests as insanity, while one entering the yin results in silence and pain. Yang diseases are characterized by quietness, while yin diseases manifest as anger.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>When the heart is troubled, there is a lack of energy and excessive heat; heat rises to the heart, causing vomiting, coughing, and regurgitation, along with wild speech, profuse sweating, and a body that feels cold and weak. The pulse should be floating, but instead, it is sinking and slippery; the complexion should be red but is instead dark. This indicates that water has overcome fire, which is a severe imbalance, and is considered fatal—ten deaths without cure. </p>
<p>If the voice is urgent and panting, with short breaths and excessive saliva, this signifies that fire has overpowered metal—yang striking yin. The yin energy sinks, while the yang energy rises; when it rises, it is solid, and when solid, it generates heat; heat leads to madness, and madness results in closed eyes and palpitations. The speech becomes nonsensical, the mouth is excessively red, and drinking is unrestrained. This heat harms the lungs, turning them into blood, and without treatment, it becomes critical. However, if the face is red but the nose is not flaring, treatment is possible.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage without heat, there may be wild talk and restlessness, with the patient unable to focus in conversation. Do not force treatment with fire but instead prescribe a minimal dose of pig weed powder, administered with about one to two liters of freshly drawn water. Encourage vigorous drinking, prompting the patient to self-induce vomiting. The illness will resolve with this action. If they cannot vomit, do not force them with water, as water stagnation can cause distress; instead, use the remaining medicine to promote vomiting.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>The Book of Living Persons</strong> (Song Dynasty, Zhu Gong)</p>
<p><strong>Febrile Madness</strong></p>
<p>This is known as yang poison. If the febrile illness has an excess of yang energy while yin energy is completely depleted, it will inevitably lead to madness, restlessness, fevered speech, facial redness, sore throat, and skin mottled like brocade. There may also be red and yellow diarrhea, with a pulse that is surging and full or slippery and rapid. It is advisable to use sour and bitter medicines to restore yin energy and induce profuse sweating to relieve symptoms. Possible remedies include Tingli Bitter Wine Decoction, Yang Poison Shengma Decoction, Dahuang San, Gardenia Seed Decoction, and Heinu Pill. </p>
<p>In cases of solar disease with madness, the heat is located in the lower abdomen, causing hardness and fullness in the lower abdomen, followed by blood discharge which can lead to recovery. There are two types of madness; one from yang poison and the other from accumulated blood. Their external symptoms and pulse characteristics differ. Patients show restlessness and frenzy, fevered speech, facial redness, sore throat with a full pulse, and a tidal fever while talking as if hallucinating; this is yang poison.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The patient has no exterior symptoms, does not experience chills or fever, has dry lips, and desires to rinse the mouth but does not want to swallow. The pulse is faint and deep, the lower abdomen is hard and full, there is a tendency for frequent urination, stools are invariably dark, and the body is yellow with madness. This is indeed a blood condition. Generally, in cases of damage from cold, there should be sweating, but if sweating does not occur, heat accumulates internally, leading to heat transforming into blood. Such a person tends to be forgetful and behaves as if mad; if blood rises in reverse, they forget more, and if blood accumulates below, then the flesh contends. In severe cases, one may need to use decoctions like Di Dang Tang or pills like Di Dang Wan; in milder cases, use Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang or Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, ensuring to eliminate all black substances for effect. There are also cases where fire pathogens cause shock and madness; the physician may use fire beneath the bed, or apply heat to the entire body to force out sweat. If the person has lost Yang, they may exhibit agitation and madness, unable to rest or sleep peacefully. Use Gui Zhi decoction without Shao Yao and add Shu Qi, Mu Li, and Long Gu for a counteracting decoction. Gui Zhi Gan Cao Long Gu Mu Li Tang is the primary remedy for these conditions.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>The Six Writings of Hejian</strong><br><strong>(by Liu Wanshu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madness and Excess</strong></p>
<p>Madness is characterized by chaos and a lack of stability. Excess refers to deviating from rituals and laws, resulting in a loss of propriety. When the outside is clear but the inside is turbid, with movements being chaotic, it resembles the nature of fire; conversely, when calm and clear, adhering to standards and maintaining balance, it reflects the nature of water. Thus, the kidney (water) governs will, and since water and fire are opposites, an abundance of heart fire leads to a diminishment of kidney water, resulting in a loss of will and madness. Some say that the excessive Yang corresponds to madness, while excessive Yin corresponds to mania; this differs from what is stated in the &quot;Suwen.&quot; The commentaries say: excessive joy leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Joy relates to the will of the heart, therefore, when the heart is intensely warm, there is much joy resulting in mania; anger relates to the will of the liver, as the fire of the liver suppresses metal and cannot maintain balance with wood, thus a strong liver results in much anger and madness. Moreover, all five emotions arise from heat, hence madness is an expression of these five emotions, predominantly anger. Generally, heat within leads to abundance in the Yangming stomach channel.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The text states: In the classic texts, it is said that when the yangming channel is disturbed, one experiences manic episodes, a distended abdomen that prevents sleep, a flushed and warm face, and nonsensical speech. It also mentions that the illness of yangming can lead to trembling with cold, frequent yawning, an aversion to people and fire, becoming startled by the sound of wood, an anxious heart, and a tendency to close oneself off, desiring to climb high and sing, shedding clothing and running, with a rumbling belly and cursing indiscriminately without regard for kinship. Furthermore, it is noted in the texts: those who have heat and are affected are generally wealthy and noble. Currently, prohibiting rich food is contrary to their desires, and forbidding fragrant herbs and mineral medicines leads to the illness not being cured; I wish to hear your explanation. Qibo replies: The aroma of fragrant herbs is pleasant, while the scent of mineral medicines is aggressive; both have an urgent and strong energy, thus, only those with a calm disposition and harmonious heart can take these two. The heat energy is fierce, and the medicinal energy is similar. When the two meet, there is a risk of internal injury to the spleen. Taking rich foods, fragrant herbs, and mineral medicines would cause this fierce heat to become strong and aggressive, leading to manic episodes. Is it not the case that mania is associated with excessive yin?<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Insult and Abuse</strong></p>
<p>Words are the voice of the heart. Insult and abuse are words of malice. Water is singular in nature; it is close and good; fire is dual, distant and evil. Water is clear and bright internally but not externally prominent. It takes the shape of vessels, embodies the essence and flavors of things, adheres without deviation to five odors and five colors, remains tranquil, harmonious, and balanced, moistens and benefits all living things, cleansing impurities to achieve purity, thus the highest goodness is like water. Water and fire are opposites, and the foolish resemble fire. Fire is brilliant externally but chaotic and murky internally, consuming all things, bringing heat and bitterness, and in its own way creates disturbance and disorder, ascending violently to damage all things, clouding clarity and leading to darkness. Water emerges from metal and moistens what is dry; fire arises from wood and harms its source. Therefore, the Book of Changes states: “Nothing moistens all things like water.” It also refers to fire as weaponry. Thus, when water is above fire, it indicates a completed situation; when water is below fire, it cannot control fire, indicating an incomplete situation. Therefore, it is known that water is good and fire is evil.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Currently, there is an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin, resulting in weak water and strong fire. The metal cannot balance the wood, and negative emotions arise; insults do not spare kin or strangers alike, while joy, laughter, irritation, and anger emerge chaotically—all manifestations of the fire within. Common people’s anger and insults are similar. Some may express joy without anger, thinking of it as playful taunting; this too is the use of inner fire. Thus, those who curse in anger also harbor joy in cursing others; anger accompanied by negativity can indicate an inner desire to express anger towards others.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to mania and running about, cursing without regard for kin or strangers indicates an excess of yang and deficiency of yin. The formula known as &quot;Daungui Chengqi Decoction,&quot; which combines &quot;Chengqi Decoction&quot; with angelica, ginger, and jujube, is used to promote continuous movement. When the situation is moderate, it may be treated with San Sheng Powder to induce vomiting; subsequently, employ &quot;Liangge San,&quot; &quot;Xixin San,&quot; or &quot;Huanglian Jiedu Decoction&quot; to adjust the treatment. </p>
<p>For madness arising from delusion, when one climbs over walls or roofs and leaps into wells or rivers, this is caused by extreme yang heat. In such cases, the &quot;Daungui Chengqi Decoction&quot; combined with detoxifying measures should be administered. For haunting disturbances leading to mania, again &quot;Daungui Chengqi Decoction&quot; is indicated. In severe cases of madness, where one jumps into rivers or wells, if the orifices are not open after three purgations, do not persist in laxative measures; instead, use &quot;Guati San&quot; to induce vomiting to expel phlegm and accumulated substances, leading to recovery. Subsequent treatment can include something like &quot;Guanlu Drink&quot; for further adjustment.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Clarity</strong></p>
<p><strong>(by Jin Chengwuji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Madness from Febrile Illness</strong></p>
<p>How can we explain madness resulting from febrile illness? Madness signifies unruliness, indicating a state of unrest. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: When madness first arises, there may be little sleep and no hunger; it is characterized by self-proclaimed wisdom, efforts to distinguish oneself, arrogance, vain laughter, a love for music, and restless wandering. Madness arises from excessive Yang energy. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: When Yin cannot overcome Yang, the pulse becomes weak and illness arises, resulting in madness. It also states: If pathogens enter through Yang, madness occurs; if they enter through Yin, it leads to muteness. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; further states: Excessive Yang leads to madness, while excessive Yin leads to delirium. The &quot;Maijing&quot; states: Yin attached to Yang leads to madness, while Yang attached to Yin leads to delirium. The &quot;Disease Origins&quot; states: Yang pathogens accompanying Yang result in madness, while Yin pathogens accompanying Yin lead to delirium. Thus, the madness described in various classics clearly indicates the predominance of Yang energy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>In the case of Yangming disease, the patient, like a wicked person faced with fire, is startled by the sound of wood, their heart desires to move. They may close doors and windows, and if the condition worsens, they might want to climb high and sing, throwing off their clothing and leaping over walls, going to places they normally cannot reach. This is called the Yang evil combining with Yangming. When there is cold damage and heat toxins in the stomach, affecting the heart, it disturbs the spirit and makes the will unstable, leading to madness. When cold damage reaches the stage of madness, it signifies the extreme of evil heat; only major purging or vomiting can alleviate it. </p>
<p>Additionally, there can be heat in the lower jiao, making the person appear mad. The classic says: when heat enters the bladder, the person seems mad. This appearance of madness suggests they are not truly mad, but restless when lying down or getting up. They may speak wildly, have eyes that reflexively stare straight ahead, which indicates a weakness of the kidneys. Sweating without relief suggests renewed heat, and speaking wildly implies a loss of will, leading to death. In such cases, it is likely beyond the reach of medicinal stone, indicating a true illness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p>
<h3>Mad Words and Delirious Speech: A Discussion on Zheng Sound</h3>
<p>Mad speech refers to wide-open eyes, speaking to others about matters never before seen, thus it is termed mad speech. Delirious speech involves closed eyes and self-talk about commonly seen and practiced matters, hence it is recognized as delirious speech. Zheng sound is weak in battle, disconnected, and the characters are produced from the throat, thus it is called Zheng sound.</p>
<h3>Madness and Mania</h3>
<p>Madness is associated with yin, while mania is associated with yang. Madness often brings joy, whereas mania frequently elicits anger. A weak pulse can be treated; if it is strong, it is fatal. Generally, this condition stems from phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest, so treatment should calm the mind and remove the phlegm. There are also those who develop this illness due to possession by evil spirits, in which case, treat it with methods to dispel the evil. The discussion in the &quot;Treatise on Original Diseases&quot; is particularly precise, affirming what the world calls heavy yin corresponds to madness, and heavy yang corresponds to mania. Generally, these are symptoms of heat. </p>
<p>In madness, the spirit is not at rest, words spoken seem to draw from visions, lasting for years without cure, damaging the heart, which is a true ailment. If the heart is filled with heat, it should be purified; if phlegm obscures the mind, it is necessary to expel the phlegm and calm the spirit. If there is weeping and groaning due to possession, this is not mania, but rather a treatment involving burning mulberry paper and administering small amounts of wine. </p>
<p>Wind-induced madness brings pain to the chest, causing ringing in the ears, for which Tianmeng Dong can be used to soothe the heart, ground into powder and taken with wine in small doses. </p>
<p>Madness is to be treated in spring, alleviating itself by summer, and medicines that support heart qi should be used. Yang deficiency with yin excess leads to madness, while yin deficiency with yang excess leads to mania. For mania, significant purging and downward treatment is essential.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Active Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The fire of the five emotions arises from the seven feelings, becoming stagnant and forming phlegm, hence leading to symptoms of epilepsy and madness. Such conditions should be regulated through human affairs, rather than relying on medicinal stone. One must examine the underlying issues to bring balance. </p>
<p>Anger that harms the liver causes madness and epilepsy, which can be subdued by overcoming it with worry and resolved by fear. Joy that harms the heart results in delirium and epilepsy, which can be alleviated by overcoming it with fear and resolved by anger. Worry that harms the lungs leads to epilepsy and delirium, which can be mitigated by overcoming it with joy and resolved by anger. Overthinking that harms the spleen results in epilepsy, delirium, and madness, which can be countered by overcoming it with anger and resolved by joy. Fear that harms the kidneys leads to delirium and epilepsy, which can be alleviated by overcoming it with thought and resolved by worry. Shock that harms the gallbladder results in delirium, which can be mitigated by overcoming it with worry and resolved by fear. Sorrow that harms the heart membrane results in delirium, which can be alleviated by overcoming it with fear and resolved by anger. This method can only be effectively managed by the wise.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>On Mania and Madness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: When the Yangming channel is blocked, one experiences mania with desires to run and call out, a full abdomen that prevents sleep, a red and heated face, and delusions and irrational speech. It further notes that in severe cases, individuals may discard their clothing, climb high to sing, leap over walls and roofs, and curse indiscriminately without regard for kinship. This arises from an excess of Yang energy, with heat and dryness of the stomach and large intestine accumulating within. These are the symptoms of mania and madness. </p>
<p>The terms “mania” and “madness” suggest different conditions, don&#39;t they? The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that an excess of Yin leads to mania, whereas an excess of Yang leads to madness. The annotations of the &quot;Suwen&quot; indicate that excessive joy leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Thus, joy pertains to the heart, while anger pertains to the liver, indicating an excess of fire from these two organs.</p>
<p>The Yin-Yang theory of the &quot;Nanjing&quot; may not be entirely accurate. Generally, madness is characterized by an abundance of phlegm-fire, whereas mania is attributed to insufficient heart blood, often seen in individuals with lofty aspirations that are unachieved. Madness may be treated with grounding therapies, while mania should involve calming the spirit and nourishing the blood, with a focus on reducing phlegm-fire. However, these two conditions, when accompanied by vacant expressions and wide-eyed stares resembling foolishness, leave me at a loss as to how to proceed.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Someone asked, &quot;The Inner Canon says that when the Yangming disease is severe, one discards their clothes and runs, climbs high to sing, or may not eat for several days yet leaps over walls and roofs. The places where one ascends are beyond what is normally possible. How can it be that one cannot eat due to illness but is still able to reach extraordinary heights? Is this possible?&quot; It was replied, &quot;The Classic of Difficulties states: &#39;Excess yang leads to madness, excess yin leads to mania.&#39; It also mentions that those with mania are often joyful, while those with madness are often filled with anger. The so-called excess yang means the three full Yin-Yang pulses are vigorous and strong, hence the illness appears robust and powerful, leading to the term &#39;madness.&#39; Excess yin means the three full Yin-Yang pulses are suppressed and thin; thus, the illness manifests as fatigue and lack of strength, leading to the term &#39;mania.&#39; </p>
<p>I once saw a young man from Dongyang who was mad. One day, during a strong wind, he suddenly flew to the top of a tower in the east of the city, singing and crying. The tower had no steps to climb, and everyone viewed it as a wonder. I think of the dragon, a pure yang creature that lies hidden in the sea; its body only has scales and armor, and it lacks wings. On days when the yang energy rises, it borrows the force of the wind and clouds to soar. This is the meaning here. Why should it be deemed strange?</p>
<p>Regarding pulse diagnosis:</p>
<p>A pulse that is large, hard, and rapid indicates mania; a sinking, rapid pulse suggests phlegm-heat. A large, slippery pulse indicates self-reliance; a sinking, small, rapid pulse is a sign of death; a weak, taut, rapid pulse is also fatal. When the cun pulse is large and slippery, if it sinks it indicates a solid condition, and if it is slippery it indicates qi. When solid and qi clash, death occurs if it enters the zang organs but can heal if it enters the fu organs.&quot;<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Essential Methods for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madness and Mania</strong></p>
<p>Madness and mania arise from the stagnation of emotions, leading to the production of phlegm and saliva, which block the heart&#39;s orifices, causing a loss of self-awareness. The eyes stare without blinking, there is nonsensical speech and cursing, and at times, individuals may leap over walls or rooftops, attacking others naked. The treatment aims to resolve phlegm and calm the heart: it is advisable to use a formula such as &quot;Chen Sha Miao Xiang San&quot; with gold foil and pearl powder, mixed with the powdered Baiwanzi from Qingzhou, and taken with strong ginger decoction, swallowing fourteen pills. There’s also &quot;Huashi Liuyi Decoction&quot; with pearl powder, taken with plain broth. Those suffering from derangement should take &quot;Siqi Decoction&quot; to recover. Phlegm causes confusion because of its obstruction and, in cases of amnesia, palpitations, or stupor with seizures, this remedy should similarly be used. If madness is unstable and cannot be cured by lighter remedies, then &quot;Taiyi Ointment&quot; and &quot;Baodan Pill&quot; should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Wind</strong></p>
<p>Heart Wind refers to a state of spirit confusion, with fluctuating joy and anger, occasional speechlessness, and erratic behavior resembling madness, though less intense. This is also caused by phlegm and qi, and &quot;Xingxiang San&quot; with equal parts of fragrant calamus and ginseng should be taken, along with &quot;Shou Xing Wan.&quot; If there is heat trapped in the heart, which manifests infrequently with agitation, heat in the nose and eyes, and difficulty in breathing—resembling Heart Wind, but recurring—one can take &quot;Shensu Decoction&quot; with an additional coin of fragrant calamus.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Medical Essentials</strong><br><strong>by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Distinction Between Mania and Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Mania is characterized by delirious speech and erratic behavior, while epilepsy refers to a state of stiffness and unawareness, each having its own distinct symptoms. Currently, mania is linked to the spleen, while epilepsy is connected to the lungs. However, scriptures mention that those suffering from both mania and epilepsy may interchange between the two, and it is also noted that symptoms of epilepsy may manifest as mania. Thus, there are cases where both conditions coexist. </p>
<p>In conditions of mania accompanied by delirious speech and erratic movement, along with instances of stiffness and unawareness, patients may also hallucinate as if seeing ghosts or deities, with such episodes lasting half a day or more; this indicates coexisting mania and epilepsy. </p>
<p>Individuals with mania experience less sleep, which allows the defensive energy (Wei) to act independently. When the Yang force does not engage with the Yin, it leads to an excess of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, resulting in confusion of the spirit. When sleep is attained, the defensive energy can merge with the Yin, replenishing the deficiency, and thus harmonizing both Yin and Yang leads to recovery. </p>
<p>In cases of mania or epilepsy, where there is an aversion to sleep and a sense of self-sufficiency and wisdom, along with incessant chaotic behavior, a remedy may be to tranquilize the five internal organs, calming the heart and its energy by consuming one boiled white rooster, seasoned with five flavors, made into a porridge. </p>
<p>The scriptures state: &quot;Sorrow affects the inner vitality, causing harm to the soul; if the soul is harmed, one becomes delusional and unfocused, which leads to disharmony.&quot; To address the mania stemming from sorrow, warm herbs should be administered to nourish the Yang of the soul; for example, the formulas of Rehmannia Decoction and Jingqi Pills serve this purpose.</p>
<p>Further, the scriptures say: &quot;Excessive joy can harm the corporeal soul; when the corporeal soul is harmed, mania ensues, causing a loss of understanding of oneself.&quot; Hence, when mania is caused by excessive joy, cool herbs should be used to nourish the Yin of the corporeal soul, such as cinnabar, turmeric, and white alum.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Li Chan】</p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy is characterized by unpredictable emotions.</strong></p>
<p>The commentary on &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Excessive joy leads to epilepsy, while excessive anger leads to mania. Joy belongs to the heart, and anger belongs to the liver; both are manifestations of excess fire. However, joy disperses energy, and those who are unable to fulfill their ambitions often experience stagnation and frustration. Generally, those whose hearts are clouded by phlegm can be treated with Ye&#39;s Qingxin Pills, Gold Leaf Tranquil Heart Pills, or Cinnabar Calming Spirit Pills. For those suffering from heart wind epilepsy, one can use Niu Huang Qingxin Pills or Zhuifeng Qutan Pills, and for the weak, add a piece of purple river vehicle to make a paste. Anger injures the liver; for this, use Ning Shen Daotan Decoction, Xie Qing Pills, or Danggui Longhui Pills. For those startled, use Baodan Pills or Jingqi Pills. Danxi states: The fire of the five emotions, when stagnant, produces phlegm, leading to epilepsy or mania, which should be managed by practical means. For instance, if joy injures the heart, it can be resolved with anger or overcome with fear; if worry injures the lungs, it can be overcome with joy or resolved with anger.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Madness Related to Dampness and Heat</p>
<p>When Yangming exhibits madness due to mixed symptoms of febrile disease, if there is excess heat in the stomach and large intestine, with dryness and fire accumulating within, and constipation occurs, use Liangge San with Da Huang to treat it. For madness occurring after overeating rich foods, simply use salt water to induce vomiting, and it will recover, or use a mild adjusting soup. If hot and fierce qi causes madness after taking fragrant herbs or stone medicine, administer Sanhuang Shigao Decoction with Huanglian, Gancao, Qingdai, and Banlangen, or Zijing Ding.</p>
<p>Severe Yin Leads to Epilepsy, Severe Yang Leads to Madness</p>
<p>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;Severe Yin leads to epilepsy, severe Yang leads to madness.&quot; Hejian treats epilepsy and madness as one, both pertaining to phlegm-fire. The notion of severe Yin is not accurate. However, there are cases of temporary madness, where one speaks nonsensically but does not become long-term epileptic; conversely, some may be confused and deluded, yet remain stable and not become mad for a long time. Thus, Hejian unifies these concepts at the beginning, while the &quot;Nanjing&quot; provides further analysis afterward.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>The one who is insane displays abnormalities. Generally, they can speak, but during the episode, they fall silent; if they normally do not speak, in this state, they may moan, and in severe cases, they may become rigid and stare blankly, their hearts often unhappy. This indicates a deficiency in yin and blood, with unrest in the heart fire. The main remedy is the Great Regulating Decoction. For those who faint intermittently, use the Nourishing Yin and Tranquilizing Spirit Decoction; for those with incoherent speech, use the Calming Will Pill; for those who grieve and moan, use fried silkworms, burnt paper, combined with two qian of wine, and regularly take castor bean decoction to eliminate the root cause.</p>
<p>The one who is manic is dangerously mad. In mild cases, they are arrogant and self-righteous, enjoying singing and dancing; in severe cases, they may strip off their clothing and run, leap over fences and roofs; in even more extreme cases, they may yell with disheveled hair, not fearing water or fire, and even delight in killing. This indicates an overabundance of heart fire, with excess yang energy, causing the spirit to be uncontained, and phlegm-fire to accumulate, hence the need for the Lesser Regulating Decoction, the Three Huang Pill, the Controlling Phlegm Elixir, and the Single Bitter Asparagus Pill. Mania primarily targets expelling phlegm and reducing fire, while insanity also addresses calming the spirit and nourishing the blood. If there is chronic damage to the heart over the years, it cannot be treated.</p>
<p>Those whose vision, hearing, speech, and movements are all deluded are said to be possessed by malevolent spirits. In severe cases, they might claim to have seen and heard things in their lifetime, including supernatural beings of various colors. This indicates an extreme deficiency of qi and blood, insufficient spirit brightness, or the entrapment of excessive phlegm-fire, leading to a confused spirit; it is not genuinely due to supernatural beings or malign spirits.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Generally, for internal treatment of typhoid and plague, a yellow pill made with human ingredients should be prepared according to the prescriptions for qi, blood, and phlegm; or one may simply use human yellow on its own as well. Alternatively, a pill made from ground stone calamus and pig&#39;s heart blood can also be effective. If a woman dreams at night of a ghost coming to engage with her, a settling essence pill should be prepared, adding red beans, and decocted with water for ingestion. </p>
<p>If a woman experiences excessive menstrual bleeding, with blood and qi disturbing the heart, or suffers from postpartum lochia rushing upward leading to disordered speech and mental confusion, this is due to blood deficiency and spirit depletion. It is advisable to use a calming essence balm, but one must avoid solely relying on heart-replenishing and spirit-consolidating medicines. For blood heat, a Xiaochaihu decoction should be prepared with ginger and fresh earth, taken for more than a hundred doses to stabilize. </p>
<p>If blood confuses the heart covering, causing one to climb the walls and sing at any time, a carefree powder with the addition of distant wisdom, peach kernel, red flower, and su mu should be given. After taking it, if the illness recedes, use a Pingwei powder with less common magnolia bark, but double the amount of Atractylodes and Ascending Peony for regular use to eradicate the root of the illness. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if a man has stagnant blood, one should use Tao&#39;s angelica active blood decoction. If someone experiences acute symptoms resembling cholera, with vomiting and diarrhea, or behaves deliriously like a drunk person, one should know that the issue has arisen from the heart. If deceased and the mouth cannot open, urgently administer the typhoid chasing soul decoction. Externally, the dispelling evil pill should be used for nasal administration.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Frigid Fever Madness</strong></p>
<p>Madness occurs when the heat and toxins enter the stomach and combine with the heart, leading to confusion of the mind, rapid speech and action, nonsensical discernment and laughter. In severe cases, one may sing atop high places, discard clothing and run, leap over walls and roofs, with no hunger or sleep, all due to inappropriate sweating, excessive yang energy, and a violent deficiency of yin. This is not remedied without significant purging.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage lasting four to five days with body heat and agitation, and one cannot sweat leading to madness, both exterior and interior present with heat; the treatment is San Huang Shi Gao Tang or Shuang Jie San.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage lasting six to seven days with strong heat, chest fullness, constipation, and a strong, rapid pulse leading to madness, the remedy is Da Cheng Qi Tang plus Huang Lian.</p>
<p>When yang toxicity abounds causing madness, with much dry heaving, a red face with spots, sore throat, and yellow or red diarrhea, along with strong heat and inability to sweat, the treatment is Ting Li Ku Jiu Tang.</p>
<p>If there is a sore throat with phlegm and blood, treat with Yang Du Sheng Ma Tang. For severe tidal heat, use Zhi Zi Ren Tang. If tidal heat comes with constipation, the treatment is Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang plus Da Huang, or San Huang Tang.</p>
<p>For rashes that should not be purged, use Cao Long Dan alone, boiled in water. For those who run wildly, use Gua Di San to induce vomiting of phlegm. </p>
<p>In seasonal heat toxicity leading to madness, use Hei Nu Wan while employing both water soaking methods, fire scorching methods, and Wang’s Yuan Ming Powder. </p>
<p>In all cases of madness presenting with yang symptoms and pulse, treatment should proceed cautiously; if encountering yin symptoms, yin pulse, or a curled tongue and contracted throat, it indicates imminent death.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Like Madness</strong></p>
<p>There are those with excessive yin causing agitation, wanting to sit in the well like a madman; there are those affected by fire, alarmed and restless like a madman. Nevertheless, there are three signs of madness that resemble the madness induced by yang poison, which is why they are mentioned. </p>
<p>Madness due to the stagnation of blood presents with a deep and solid pulse, frequent rinsing of the mouth without swallowing, showing no outward symptoms; yet blood is accumulated in the lower part of the body, and urination is smooth like madness. With or without exterior and interior symptoms, if the pulse is rapid, good appetite but no bowel movement, it is like madness. </p>
<p>In the initial signs of taiyang, heat is trapped in the lower part of the body like madness, and if blood flows downward, recovery follows. If the exterior has not been resolved, use Guizhi Decoction or Tao’s Gui Ling Drink; if the exterior has cleared but with urgent distension in the lower abdomen, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction; if there is blood affecting the heart and spleen, use Danggui Huoxue Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is taiyin with a yellowish hue and cloudy urination like madness, use Wuling Powder. All these conditions are akin to madness; however, if in sleep one wishes to rise and walk, speaking erratically, still knowing to advise against it, this can still be controlled. It is different from the fierceness of true madness, which cannot be restrained.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>In ancient and modern medical teachings, the distinction between madness and insanity is discussed.</p>
<p>The illness of madness is primarily driven by excessive heart fire, causing the spirit to lose its residence; this sums it up. Madness reaches its peak; fire has an upward nature, just as the classics state that when the Yang energy is excessively elevated, it leads to madness. The “Ling Shu” states: when the disease of madness begins, there is little sleep and lack of appetite, arising from a sense of superiority, self-knowledge, and self-worth. Thus, the mad are driven to pursue, speaking grandly and with great ambition. Previously, it was said that insane speech appears as though they have seen something; indeed, this arises from extreme heart fire where words may mix good and evil, showing no regard for closeness or distance; this is the chaos of the spirit, which is termed madness. It indicates that when the fire is exceedingly intense and Yang energy is too elevated, the patient also rides on this fiery ascent, hence they discard their garments and climb heights, transitioning from madness to insanity. This is a way the sages have named a phenomenon that shares similarities but also has differences within.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>In ancient medicine, treating epilepsy and insanity with the same formula is a great error. Insanity is primarily a disease of the heart and often arises from excess, while epilepsy involves multiple organ systems and tends to be of a deficiency nature. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that insanity, epilepsy, and seizures are labels for conditions where one does not understand their suffering; later practitioners misinterpreted this as a single condition. However, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; discusses insanity and epilepsy as distinct conditions. The phrase “not knowing one&#39;s suffering” refers to a lack of awareness of the exact nature of the ailment. </p>
<p>Treatment methodologies should be differentiated. </p>
<p>High elevation and shedding of clothing, which leads to excessive weight and distance, are linked to insanity; the treatment should focus on reducing and eliminating phlegm and excessive fire, utilizing methods like rolling phlegm pills. In contrast, those who become overly discerning, speak irrationally, and lose their mental acuity are experiencing mania; the treatment should stabilize the heart and calm the spirit, employing methods such as pills of cow bile and vermilion.</p>
<p>Regarding heart wind diseases, few texts provide detailed accounts and many confuse them with epilepsy, treating them indistinctly. Although &quot;heart wind&quot; appears to be a term from the secular realm, it truly reflects serious illness. The ancients noted that wind moves swiftly and with various changes; wind causing paralysis is unaffectionate. &#39;Heart wind&#39; does not refer to external wind invading the interior, but rather signifies an internal change that is erratic and unkind, akin to a demonic infestation of the heart. This condition typically arises from long-term emotional strife and differs significantly from epilepsy. Epilepsy and mania are primarily characterized by intense heat and abundant wind-phlegm, with an overflow affecting the heart, which is often a condition of excess.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>When the heart wind arises, it is caused by the seven emotions and five desires being persistently thwarted. The liver often schemes, the gallbladder is frequently indecisive, and feelings have no outlet. The heart’s function is thought, and if this becomes severe, the heart’s blood diminishes daily, the spleen&#39;s fluids do not circulate, and phlegm obstructs the heart&#39;s orifices, leading to the formation of heart wind, which is mostly of a vacuous nature. The treatment must counter the seven emotions, fulfill the five desires, nourish the blood, clear phlegm, and bring the spirit back to the residence, addressing both the root and branches; this condition can be cured.</p>
<p>However, if one confuses this with epilepsy and hastily treats it, that is to invite an accelerated demise. Oh! When heart wind first manifests, it often pertains to a vacuous condition. Why is this? Excessive thinking harms the spleen, leading to diminished essence, daily depletion of blood, and the spirit becomes dispersed, no longer residing in its abode, which suddenly results in heart wind. Thus, it is known that its beginnings are all related to vacuity— prescriptions like Gui Pi Decoction, Yang Xin Decoction, and Ding Zhi Pill can be applied. </p>
<p>As for prolonged illness, the heart’s intentions change, leading to ignorance of beauty and ugliness, thoughts and worries disappear, and dietary habits remain the same, while aggressive energies increase, solidifying the roots of the disease. For those who have unresolved phlegm stagnation, the Zihua Method can be used for treatment, adjusting according to the symptoms, and nothing will fail to cure.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>On Wealth and Poverty in Relation to Difficulty and Ease</strong></p>
<p>The heart and mind disease is difficult for the wealthy. Those with rich and extravagant diets accumulate excess, and when illness strikes, their righteous energy is weak while pathogenic energy is strong, making it hard to cure. For the poor, it is easier. They have a simple and sparse diet, and their constitution is generally robust; even if they fall ill, their righteous energy remains abundant while pathogenic energy is light, making it easier to treat.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; only mentions mania without addressing epilepsy, whereas the &quot;Lingshu&quot; includes names for epilepsy and seizures. Various texts refer to mania in different ways—some mention madness, some refer to epilepsy, and others speak of wind-associated epilepsy or shock-related epilepsy, with divisions within epilepsy itself, yet none provide a definitive conclusion. Those who solely mention mania trace back to the &quot;Suwen&quot;; discussions on epilepsy or madness originate from the &quot;Lingshu.&quot; Importantly, mania and epilepsy are fundamentally different; it is not merely a case of differing terminologies but of distinct conditions. Although the &quot;Lingshu&quot; classifies mania and madness under one category, their manifestations are twofold, and their treatment varies, thus they differ significantly from epilepsy. Xu Sibo stated: adults have mania while children have epilepsy. However, this distinction is not entirely accurate.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that madness comes from the shock received in the mother’s womb. Now, can we say that children do not have madness? The elderly frequently experience fits, and women are particularly affected. Based on the texts, we will distinguish further below.</p>
<p>Madness can manifest as either wildness or foolishness, sometimes as singing or laughing, other times as sorrow or weeping, resembling drunkenness or daze. Their speech lacks coherence, and they are oblivious to cleanliness or filth. This state lasts for many years without recovery, commonly referred to as &quot;heart wind,&quot; which often occurs in those whose aspirations are high but whose desires are unmet.</p>
<p>During a fit of madness, the patient is often frenzied and violent, similar to how one with a fever might behave, shouting and cursing indiscriminately, regardless of kinship. In severe cases, they may climb to heights and sing, discard their clothes and run, leap over walls and rooftops, acting beyond their physical strength or speaking of things they have never witnessed—this indicates an evil influence attaching to them.</p>
<p>When epilepsy strikes, individuals may become disoriented, unable to recognize people, dizzy, and may collapse, completely unconscious of their surroundings. In severe instances, they may experience convulsions and rigidity, their eyes rolling upwards, or their mouths and eyes skewed, sometimes producing sounds akin to that of livestock.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>The Door of Madness</strong></p>
<p><strong>From &quot;The Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; by Zhang Jiebin (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The diseases of madness and epilepsy are fundamentally different. The onset of manic illness develops gradually through prolonged delusions; whereas, the onset of epilepsy occurs suddenly, with moments of rigidity and intermittent episodes. Individuals with mania are often conscious, quick to anger, and violent; whereas those with epilepsy frequently experience confusion, fatigue, and tranquility. From this perspective, the distinctions in aspects of yin and yang, as well as cold and heat, are evident. Thus, the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: &quot;The prevalence of yang indicates mania, while the prevalence of yin suggests epilepsy.&quot; This meaning is clear. Later generations of scholars have proposed that both mania and epilepsy are generally caused by heat, but this is not necessarily the case. The characteristics of qi and pulse also have their own basis, and one must carefully differentiate and treat them according to the principles of yin and yang.</p>
<p>Epilepsy is indeed the same as &quot;dian.&quot; In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the description of the dian ailment is very detailed, while the distinction of &quot;xian&quot; (epilepsy) is unclear, which can be observed from this. Later generations have used terms like &quot;epileptic fits,&quot; &quot;wind epilepsy,&quot; and &quot;wind dian,&quot; which refer to different meanings and only serve to cause confusion, not necessarily providing clarity. For instance, &quot;Bie Lu&quot; mentions five types of &quot;xian&quot;: horse epilepsy, bovine epilepsy, porcine epilepsy, ovine epilepsy, and chicken epilepsy, which correspond to what is now called sheep and pig epilepsy. This naming is merely due to phonetic similarity and lacks substantial ground. Therefore, epilepsy is singular, while various schools have added further distinctions outside the dian syndrome but also considered as &quot;xian,&quot; which truly appears forced and lacks sufficient evidence. Additionally, &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; mentions concepts of wind epilepsy, fright epilepsy, food-induced epilepsy, as well as yin and yang epilepsy, which all require discernment.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Generally, manic conditions are often caused by fire. This may stem from ambitions leading to loss of spirit, or from worries and repressed emotions, where one feels constrained with no outlet for anger. This results in the liver and gallbladder&#39;s energy becoming rebellious, with the combination of wood and fire creating a harmful influence, which indeed reflects Eastern practical evidence. When this harmful influence affects the heart, it results in the spirit not being anchored; when it affects the stomach, it leads to violent and aggressive behaviors. Therefore, those treating this should prioritize harmonizing fire, and depending on whether phlegm or qi is involved, they should examine the severity and treat both. If the issue is solely due to fire without swelling, obstruction, or heat accumulation, it is simply necessary to clear the fire. Treatments like &quot;Withdraw the Fuel Decoction,&quot; &quot;Huanglian Jiedu Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Sanbu Pill&quot; should be used. If water does not control fire and there is a slight deficiency in both heart and kidney, &quot;Zhusha Anshen Pill,&quot; or herbal preparations like &quot;Manjiao Decoction&quot; and &quot;Er Yin Decoction&quot; should be used. If the yangming fire is excessive, &quot;Baihu Decoction&quot; or &quot;Yuqian Powder&quot; is recommended. If both the heart and spleen are overheated, with unusual outbursts and slight blockage, &quot;Qingxin Decoction,&quot; &quot;Liangge Powder,&quot; &quot;Sanhuang Pill,&quot; or &quot;Danggui Longhui Pill&quot; should be used. If fire causes phlegm, &quot;Qingge Drink,&quot; &quot;Baolong Pill,&quot; or &quot;Shengtie Luo Drink&quot; should be used, with &quot;Gun Tan Pill&quot; for severe cases. If the three burners are affected by severe heat, &quot;Da Chengqi Decoction&quot; should be administered.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>If phlegm and fluid obstruct the pathways and obstruct the flow of Qi, one must first use methods to induce vomiting and also clear dietary factors. This is essential for treating mania.</p>
<p>Epileptic conditions often arise from phlegm. Whenever there is a reversal of Qi or stagnation of phlegm, it can obstruct the meridians and block the heart&#39;s gateways, leading to symptoms such as sudden fainting, drooping of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyeballs, spasms of the hands and feet, rigidity of the waist and spine, and recovery only after a while. This sudden onset and resolution of symptoms is due to the erratic flow of Qi.</p>
<p>Thus, for treatment, one should examine the phlegm and the Qi, prioritizing the more severe condition. If there is an issue of fire, one should also assess the pulse and clinical manifestations and treat accordingly. For Qi stagnation, it is advisable to use methods such as Qi-releasing drinks, harmonizing drinks, or formulations like Niuhuang Wan, Suhe Wan, or Jicheng Runxia Wan. For excessive phlegm, it is suitable to use drinks that clear the diaphragm, Liugan Decoction, Erchen Decoction, or Chenpi Banxia Decoction, or formulations like Baolong Wan and Zhushayunxian Wan. For cases with both phlegm and fire, use drinks that clear the diaphragm, Zhushay Anshen Wan, or Danqi Runxia Wan. For severe cases of phlegm reversing and Qi stagnation, one must use methods to induce vomiting and then adjust treatment according to the symptoms afterward.</p>
<p>Epileptic symptoms without fire are more common. If there is no fire pathogen, one should not recklessly use cooling medicines, for fear of harming the spleen Qi and causing the emergence of other conditions.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Furthermore, if there are conditions of excessive yin and declining yang, or if there is a sudden loss of qi and blood with absolutely no phlegm, heat, or rebellious qi, then prescriptions such as the Four Gentlemen, Four Substances, Eight Treasures, or Ten Complete Great Supplements are essential. Additionally, ingredients like dried ginger, cinnamon, and aconite must be used; one should not claim that epilepsy is entirely due to true evil and thus prohibit tonics. If there is a significant loss of true yin and qi does not return to its roots, leading to intermittent symptoms that are hard to cure and accompanied by cloudiness, one must use Ziheche Pill to achieve effectiveness. For those with a mixture of deficiency and excess, with mild phlegm-heat complicating a long-standing illness, the Lingnao Anshen Pill is most appropriate; adjustments can be made based on symptoms.</p>
<p>In cases of dementia, where there is usually no phlegm but could be due to emotional distress, unsatisfied desires, overthinking, ambivalence, or fear leading to gradual onset of dementia—with disordered speech, inappropriate actions, excessive sweating, or a tendency to worry—the manifestations can be numerous and peculiar. The pulse will typically be either wiry or rapid, large or small, changing frequently. If the reverse qi is in the heart, or if the liver and gallbladder channels have unclear qi, but the person appears strong in body, with no decrease in appetite, and lacks signs of collapse, then it is advisable to use Mianjian (a herbal decoction) for treatment; this is the most stable and effective approach.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>However, this condition has both those that can be cured and those that cannot, depending on the strength of the stomach and vital energy. Recovery must await the right time; it cannot be rushed. In cases where great fear suddenly injures the heart and gallbladder, leading to confusion and loss of spirit, the primary treatment should focus on quickly restoring the vital energy. The Qifuding or the Great Tonic Decoction can be used for this.</p>
<p>For children, they do not typically show symptoms of mania, but they often suffer from epilepsy. Children&#39;s illnesses may arise from prenatal influences or from being frightened after birth. Children’s spirits are relatively weak; when frightened, the liver and gallbladder lose their essence and the spirit cannot maintain residence. If the residence is empty, the vital energy cannot govern, allowing phlegm and evil influences to disrupt it. Thus, in treating children’s fright and seizures, one must first assess the vital energy, then examine the nature of the illnesses, and treat them accordingly. All methods are documented in pediatric texts.</p>
<p>I opine that &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; discusses the conditions of childhood fright, shock, and epilepsy. Chen Wuze discusses the causes of epilepsy based on three factors, which, although precise, imply that external wind and cold lead to manifest symptoms, while internal injury from food leads to latent symptoms; neither necessarily disrupts the spirit to this extent. Epilepsy, as a disease, is characterized by sudden fainting, particularly concerning the heart and the liver and gallbladder. It is not something that can simply arise from wind, cold, or diet. Moreover, the concept of wind-related epilepsy primarily pertains to influences of the wood element and is not described as an external affliction. Even if there are external influences or dietary issues, they are also due to the combination of fright and fear causing illness. If one lists these three causes together, it does not necessarily follow that they are equivalent.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Heat Stroke and Mania</strong></p>
<p>Heat stroke and mania arise from a true heat disease of the Yangming channel. However, there are cases that resemble mania yet are not genuinely so; this distinction between false and true must be carefully analyzed and not overlooked. In instances of true heat mania, it belongs to the Yangming channel. This is because the Yangming channel is characterized by abundant qi and blood. When the pathogenic heat enters the stomach and intestines, and the heat accumulates without resolution, mania ensues. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that the stomach is associated with earth, and thus it is startled by the sound of wood, as earth is antagonistic to wood. When the fire is harmful, excessive heat causes serious harm. Those suffering extreme illness may shed their clothes and flee, sing atop heights, or go several days without food; this is because the limbs are the foundation of all Yang, and when Yang is vigorous, the limbs are solid and capable of climbing heights. Shedding clothes and fleeing happens due to excessive heat affecting the body. Uttering nonsensical statements, cursing without concern for kin or distance while singing, indicates that excessive Yang has become pathological. It is also said that when yin cannot withstand yang, the pulse becomes thin and swift, leading to mania. Furthermore, when pathogens invade the Yang, mania results.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>This condition arises from the invasion of Yangming heat that ascends to disrupt the heart and lungs, resulting in confusion of spirit and mind. This is called Yang madness. However, when a person with a cold illness exhibits madness, it indicates that the heat pathogen has reached an extreme, and without vigorously expelling this fiery pathogen, it cannot be resolved. Thus, if one observes signs of constipation or a firm, distended abdomen, with indications to attack, it is appropriate to use methods such as the Da Xian Chui Qi (Da Xiao Cheng Qi) as well as Liang Ge San or Liu Yi Shun Qi Decoction to purge. If there are no signs of distension or firmness, and it is solely due to gastric fire, then one should simply use Bai Hu Tang or Chou Xin Yin to drain the fire pathogen, and the illness will recover on its own.</p>
<p>If the madness is not due to actual heat, there can be varying degrees of symptoms. As Zhang Zhongjing states: &quot;In cases of Taiyang disease that has not resolved, if heat has settled in the bladder, the person may appear mad, but if the exterior has not yet been resolved, it is not advisable to attack; one must first resolve the exterior. If the exterior has been resolved and there is only urgency in the lower abdomen, then it is appropriate to attack, and one should use the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang.&quot; He also says: &quot;In Taiyang disease that lasts six or seven days with exterior symptoms still present, when the pulse is weak and profound, and there is no sensation of fullness in the chest—if the person appears mad, this indicates heat in the lower jiao, with the lower abdomen likely feeling distended and urination flowing freely; in such a case, one should drain the blood to enable recovery, as indicated by Di Dang Tang.&quot;<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>According to these two points, if the heat of the sun&#39;s evil does not dissipate and enters the organs through the channels, but does not lead to true madness, it is therefore described as “like madness.” This is because the heat attacks the blood aspect and accumulates in the lower regions, hence it should be cleared downward. </p>
<p>Recently, I have observed in cases of typhus that there are also symptoms resembling madness, which ancient scholars did not mention. This may derive from loss of ambition, affecting the heart; or from sorrow and worry, affecting the lungs; or from loss of essence, affecting the kidneys; or from exhaustion due to overthinking, affecting the liver and spleen. When the root condition has already damaged the interior, and the cold evil affects from the outside, then the illness inevitably arises with the evil influence. The symptoms appear as madness, which is also referred to as “false madness.” </p>
<p>However, the signs of false madness must not display a yellow or red complexion, nor exhibit violent temperament; internally, there should be no obstruction in the chest and abdomen, and the pulse should not be slippery or solid. Although there may be intermittent agitation, if restrained, it will cease. The mouth may often speak nonsensically, and the voice will be weak. There may be visions of emptiness or a state of anxiety and instability. If we examine the upper part, the mouth will not be scorched with thirst, and if we examine the lower part, there will be no constipation. All these indicate that the essence and qi are injured, and the spirit and mind are not anchored. This condition contrasts sharply with true madness caused by extreme yang, much like the difference between ice and fire.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>At times, doctors cannot discern the condition, and upon seeing chaos, they mistakenly label it as Yang frenzy, leading to reckless purging which surely results in death. In treating this, one must differentiate between Yin and Yang. If there is deficiency combined with pathogenic factors, and the pathogen resides in the Yang aspect, then one should use remedies like the Middle-Replenishing and Qi-Increasing Decoction; if it is in the Yin aspect, remedies like the Yin-Replenishing and Qi-Increasing Decoction are appropriate. If there is deficiency without pathogens and it is in the Yang aspect, then one should use formulas such as the Four Gentlemen, Eight Treasures, or the Complete Great Replenishing Decoction; if in the Yin aspect, use formulas like the Four Substances, Six Flavors, Left Gui Decoction, or the One Yin Decoction. In cases of Yin deficiency with fire, one should add or modify the One Yin Decoction or the Two Yin Decoction; for Yang deficiency with cold, remedies such as the Regulating Middle Decoction, Resuming Yang Drink, Eight Flavor Decoction, or Right Gui Decoction should be employed. This is a general outline; however, there are different manifestations that cannot be fully communicated in words. Understanding the intention behind the words allows one to grasp what has not been said.</p>
<p>If there is slight heat in the body, or a yellowish-red face, or restlessness with a desire to sit or lie in muddy water, yet the pulse is weak and lacking strength, this resembles a Yin condition manifesting as Yang, termed Yin agitation. This occurs because Yang deficiency below prevents the Qi from returning to its source, causing it to float and disperse above, resulting in agitation like madness. Therefore, one must promptly warm and tonify below; when the life gate is warmed, the fire will return to its source, and the illness will naturally resolve. If a doctor does not recognize this and mistakenly uses cold treatments, death is inevitable.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong> [Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo]</p>
<p><strong>Method for Treating Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of epilepsy that have persisted for many years indicate phlegm trapped between the heart&#39;s orifices, unable to be released. Patients who enjoy eating charcoal likely have their heart&#39;s fire obscured by phlegm, unable to express itself. Charcoal, being a residue of fire, harmonizes with the heart&#39;s fire and flavors, making it taste sweet like honey to the patient. </p>
<p>The formula includes one ounce of ginseng, three qian each of southern star, ghost arrow, burdock root, and white peony, one qian each of aconite and cinnamon, and two qian each of pinellia, acorus, and cinnabar powder. First, boil the above herbs in two bowls of water and divide it into two doses, mixing half of the cinnabar into the medicine for the patient to take. If the patient refuses to take it, give them charcoal; after consuming it, they will be happy to eat it. If they ask for more charcoal, it is fine to provide them with it. The second dose should be prepared in the same way. If the patient does not respond as well as before, they should be made to drink it quickly. If they resist, it is permissible to strike them to provoke their anger; anger will stir the liver&#39;s wood fire, generating heat for the heart, thus helping to dispel phlegm. </p>
<p>Although patients with epilepsy often eat regularly, the qi of food within their intestines can nourish their life without dying; it is, however, the heart that remains unyielding.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>If the heart dies early, then even a healthy person consuming grains will also perish; how much more so for those with epilepsy? I have seen those who perish early cannot wait until today. As long as the heart remains alive, it is merely phlegm and evil that obstructs it. At that moment of epilepsy, the spleen and stomach still hold vitality. Therefore, I use ginseng to treat the heart, adding aconite, calamus, and cinnamon to warm the center and dispel the evil. I add bupleurum to soothe the liver and balance the wood element, along with nux vomica, ghost arrow, and pinellia to expel phlegm and eliminate the evil. I add cinnabar to stabilize the spirit and calm the soul, naturally reducing the evil qi and increasing the righteous qi.</p>
<p>There is another remarkable method for treating epilepsy. The formula includes five qians each of bupleurum and white mustard seed, three qians each of white peony, pinellia, processed nux vomica, poria, and calamus, and one qian each of aconite and ginseng. Boil with ten bowls of water until reduced to two bowls. Give the patient one bowl to drink first, which will certainly cause fatigue. Then immediately administer another bowl, which will induce deep sleep. If they sleep for one or two days, do not awaken them suddenly, as if they were dead; let them wake naturally. When they awaken and are confused, ask for food and drink. If they mention their previous condition, do not give them anything immediately. After half a day of fasting, give them rice porridge, adding five fen each of ginseng and aged tangerine peel to the soup, and cook the porridge to serve.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>Use three qian of ginseng, one liang of atractylodes, one qian of licorice, five qian each of poria and white mustard seed, and five fen of dried tangerine peel. Boil these in water and give it to them, and they will surely take it willingly. After taking it, let them sleep again; listen for them to wake up on their own, and then they will never have another episode, which is a marvelous method.</p>
<p>In cases where a person suffers from an illness analogous to flower mania, a woman might suddenly have epilepsy, seeing a man and refusing to let go of him. This represents an intense longing for a man that cannot be fulfilled, suddenly manifesting as a disease, like a violent storm, losing all sense of shame; upon seeing a man, she behaves as if he were her lover. This is due to the liver&#39;s wood being withered and an inner fire raging strongly, and the pulse will definitely be tight at the cun position. The treatment should use a formula to soothe the liver, disperse stagnation, and expel evil. Use five qian each of bupleurum, angelica, ophiopogon, and white mustard seed; one liang of white peony; and three qian each of stir-fried gardenia, poria spirit, and scrophularia; with one qian each of licorice and calamus, boiled in water to be taken.</p>
<p>If she refuses to take it, force it into her via a syringe; she will undoubtedly curse incessantly. After a while, the person will become weary and want to lie down. After they awaken, feeling shame, they will tightly close the room&#39;s door for three days, and gradually, with a little food and drink, will recover on their own. After one dose, there is no need to give her more medicine.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>Epileptic illness often arises from the weakness and coldness of the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are weak and cold, the food consumed does not transform into essential qi but instead becomes phlegm. This phlegm condenses between the chest and diaphragm, unable to flow to the heart, leading to the manifestation of epilepsy. If one only treats phlegm without nourishing qi, there will inevitably be cases of sudden death. </p>
<p>The recipe for the treatment is as follows: Take five qian each of ginseng and white mustard seed, one liang of white atractylodes, one qian each of cinnamon, dried ginger, and tangerine peel, five fen each of licorice and fragrant calamus, and three qian of pinellia; decoct these herbs in water to take. This formula uses ginseng and atractylodes specifically to nourish the spleen and stomach, dried ginger to dispel cold pathogens, white mustard seed and pinellia to eliminate stubborn phlegm, and licorice and fragrant calamus to guide the formula into the heart and open the orifices. Naturally, the righteous qi returns, and the phlegm disperses. </p>
<p>With one dose, the spirit stabilizes; with a second dose, the spirit flourishes. What epilepsy cannot be cured? As for the manifestation of flower-related epilepsy, it stems from a woman&#39;s obsession with someone, which is also due to the coldness of the spleen and stomach allowing the evil to invade. For this condition, add one liang of white peony root, two qian of bupleurum, and three qian of stir-fried gardenia to the original recipe, omitting the cinnamon; it is also very effective, often stopping the epilepsy with just one dose. The reason is that bupleurum, white peony, and stir-fried gardenia all enter the liver to balance the wood element, dispel fire and scatter stagnant qi, thus achieving this extraordinary effect.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Treatment of Stupor</p>
<p>Stupor resembles madness, silent and uncommunicative; like hunger, it lingers but feels lost. The mind desires to act wildly yet cannot; the heart wishes to be frantic but is afraid. Sometimes one may sleep for days without waking, at other times sit for days without sleeping. Occasionally, they meticulously mend their own clothes, or deeply hide and cover someone else&#39;s belongings. When speaking with others, they are mute and seem to drift away; when alone, they whisper quietly and cry. They may express aversion to food and refuse to swallow, yet when not offered food, they consume charcoal as if it were delightful. Although these symptoms may be attributed to possession or evil influence, they are essentially caused by phlegm and qi obstructing the chest and abdomen. Thus, the treatment for stupor is no mystery; treating phlegm is the same as treating stupor.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>However, when phlegm is at its peak and dullness is profound, how can it be effectively treated with ordinary Erchen Decoction? Therefore, the method uses the Immortal Pill to expel dullness: one tael each of ginseng, white mustard seed, and dodder seed; two taels of white atractylodes; three taels of poria; five qian of pinellia; five fen of aconite; three qian each of white wood蘇 and cinnabar, ground into powder. First, decoct each herbal ingredient, then mix the cinnabar powder with half a bowl of the decoction. If he refuses to take it, administer it with charcoal, and he will gladly drink it. After giving him another half bowl, allow him to act as he wishes; he will certainly feel tired and want to sleep. </p>
<p>Take advantage of his deep sleep to burn all his clothing and bedding, leaving only the garments he is wearing, and cover him with a new blanket, being careful not to wake him. This sleep may last several days; when he wakes, he will surely look for his clothes and find nothing, search for his bedding and discover it is not familiar, leading him to cry out in distress. Then present him with the same medicine again; he will surely refuse to take it, and even refuse the charcoal. It may be effective to whip him to provoke his anger, using strong individuals to hold him down and force the previous medicine into him; he will undoubtedly become very angry, and afterward, he will fall asleep again.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>At this time, one must prepare fresh clothing, bedding, and other items, awaiting his awakening in half a day. When he sees that the whole room is filled with relatives, his heart will suddenly clear as if he understands, and he will undoubtedly weep greatly. Others should gently persuade him, and he will surely speak of matters concerning spirits and deities. Relatives will then say that a certain person has treated him and has already dispelled all the spirits, so there is no need for further worry. Upon hearing this, he will feel joyful, and his illness will be completely cured. The key to this method lies in greatly nourishing the heart and spleen, using Fuling (Poria) as the primary agent, which helps to expel phlegm from the heart; the remaining phlegm-dissolving medicine, along with Aconite, guides it throughout the body, sending all phlegm into the bladder for digestion. Baiwei (White Clay) and Tusizi (Cuscuta) are both excellent soothing herbs, while Cinnabar stabilizes the soul and calms the spirit, thus having remarkable effects, which is why they are used and produce results.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The condition of &quot;stupor&quot; arises from a blockage of emotions, sometimes resulting from anger and at other times from shame. The remedy consists of one tael each of ginseng, Chaihu (Bupleurum), Angelica, calamus, and jujube seeds; four taels of white peony; five qian each of licorice, tian nanxing (Arisaema), turmeric, and shenqu; one qian of aconite; three taels of poria; and ten bowls of water, boiled down to one bowl for administration. The patient will likely refuse to drink the medicine. To facilitate the process, two individuals should hold the patient&#39;s hands while one supports their chin, another inserts a blunt sheep horn into their mouth, and yet another holds the patient&#39;s head to pour the medicine into the horn. If the patient vomits, it is no concern; the focus should be to administer the entire dose. The patient may scream and curse, but after a while, they will become tired and want to sleep. It is important to allow them to wake up on their own without disturbance. If they awaken naturally, they will fully recover; if startled awake, their recovery will be only partial. This is one method of treating this condition.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Mania</strong></p>
<p>When phlegm accumulates in the stomach and cannot be expelled, it leads to maniacal speech as if seeing ghosts, intermittently appearing and disappearing, causing a blockage in the chest. One should boil five pounds of beef and two dou of water into a soup and drink it until one can no longer eat. With a goose feather, probe for vomiting, and one will surely expel a large amount, specifically until a lump of thick yellow phlegm is expelled before ceasing. If it does not come out, drink again, ensuring it is completely expelled before stopping, or the previous condition will suddenly worsen. Afterwards, gradually drink a decoction of dried tangerine peel, Poria, licorice, and white atractylodes to restore balance.</p>
<p>In cases of fever leading to mania, where one might climb high and sing, discard clothing and run, dive into water, shout and curse without regard for kin, such beings are far from life. Zhongjing saved them with a decoction of bamboo leaves and gypsum, which is quite wonderful. The fire of Yangming is the most intense; once it erupts, it cannot be saved without a large dose of White Tiger Decoction to halt its overwhelming spread. However, people often fear using too much, thus employing only a small amount, akin to using a cup of water to extinguish a burning pile of firewood. Therefore, gypsum must be used in a dose of three or four taels or even half a pound, prepared in one decoction, for the fire&#39;s intensity to begin to diminish, and mania can also be somewhat alleviated. Yet, gypsum has a strong nature; though it effectively cools the fire, it can still damage the stomach&#39;s qi, hence it must be used in conjunction with ginseng for optimal effect. </p>
<p>Currently, there is a formula that uses half the White Tiger Decoction while adding other medicinal ingredients, named the Stomach-Replenishing Decoction. It consists of three taels each of gypsum, Scrophularia, and Ophiopogon, three qian of Anemarrhena, five qian each of ginseng and Plantago, and one tael of Poria, all combined with water for decoction.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>This formula uses gypsum and Anemarrhena as a remedy to drain stomach fire, ginseng to generate stomach qi, and Yuan Shen to eliminate excess heat. Ophiopogon nourishes the yin of the lungs, while Poria and Plantago help direct fire downward to the bladder, allowing it to exit through urination. Furthermore, when there is excessive fire, one’s mouth must be dry; with thirst comes increased water intake. I employ these two ingredients to disperse moisture, so that when water flows, the fire dissipates alongside it. This formula drains fire without harming qi, appearing superior to Bai Hu Tang. One dose calms the delirium, two doses reduce thirst by half, and three doses stop the thirst completely, also extinguishing the fire, thus four doses are unnecessary. </p>
<p>For those experiencing fire heat leading to delirium, or sweating profusely like rain, with dry mouth and tongue, or sensations like thorn pricks, this formula will yield immediate effects, ensuring it does not lead to death. &quot;Living treatment&quot; refers to situations where a person is on the brink of death, but not yet dead, and medication is used to restore them. For instance, cases of manic or comatose illness are often due to heat illness, characterized by singing high, running while discarding clothing, jumping into water, and incessantly shouting violent words, with protruding tongue and relentless thirst, producing bright phlegm and a face resembling an inflamed state. </p>
<p>The formula uses half a pound of gypsum, one pound of Yuan Shen, three taels of white mustard and pinellia each, one tael of Anemarrhena, ginseng, and licorice, along with five taels of Ophiopogon and several hundred pieces of bamboo leaves. First, half a sheng of glutinous rice is boiled to create a broth, with the rice grains removed. Half a pot of this broth is then used to brew the previously mentioned herbs, with several bowls taken to provide in response to requests for water. Offer it continuously and, once finished, sleep will follow. Promptly use another pound of Yuan Shen and half a pound of Ophiopogon for brewing while waiting.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>When someone awakens and calls for water, give them this soup, and they will surely drink it with joy. After finishing it, they will likely fall into a deep sleep again, and then prepare more soup with the residue for when they wake. When they wake again, if they do not want to drink as before, do not force them; let it happen naturally. Later, use three taels of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, six taels of codonopsis, one tael of cornus, decocted into two bowls to give them. One dose will surely cure them, and there is no need to repeat it. This is one method of treatment.</p>
<p>As for those who have a fit of madness but stop to curse at others, not thirsty, and refuse to drink the offered water, this is madness caused by cold. It arises from stagnation of Qi and repressed anger; such individuals typically display weakness and lack of spirit, and the madness manifests abruptly. The treatment should focus on expelling phlegm while also supplementing Qi. The prescription includes one tael each of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atractylodes, one qian each of pinellia, nux vomica, and aconite, and three fen of calamus, all decocted and taken. The brilliance of this formula lies in supplementing Qi while not excessively expelling phlegm. Cold-induced madness is treated similarly to epilepsy, and aconite is included to eliminate cold Qi, while calamus directs the remedy to the heart channel, letting it naturally soothe the throat for sound sleep, as if lost to the disease. Adding one qian of bupleurum helps to relieve the stagnation of the liver wood Qi, further enhancing effectiveness.</p>
<p>Some individuals may have persistent madness that does not improve; they might attack others with a knife, curse officials loudly, fail to recognize family, or have children unaware of them, showing joy at the sight of water but anger at food. This reflects a deficiency of heart Qi and an invasion by heat evil, along with phlegm Qi encumbering them.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>These ailments desire to dispel fire, yet fire resides within the heart, making it impossible to disperse; they want to eliminate phlegm, yet phlegm is also in the heart, making it difficult to dissolve. Only by strengthening the energy of the spleen and stomach can the heart receive nourishment on its own. There’s no need to eliminate phlegm; it will naturally transform, and there’s no need to dispel fire; it will naturally cease. This method is named &quot;Transforming Madness Elixir,&quot; using one tael each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and poria, one fen (a unit), and three qian each of pinellia and cuscus, one qian each of calamus and licorice, boiled in water for consumption. One dose will calm the madness, and the second will heal the illness. This method is excellent for nourishing the heart, spleen, and stomach while transforming phlegm without dispelling fire. For if fire is dispelled, the heart&#39;s energy becomes more injured, and phlegm accumulates further; how can madness be stopped? Notably, the use of one fen of aconite is brilliant, facilitating the nourishing of the heart and the dissolving of phlegm directly into the heart, allowing energy to be easily replenished and phlegm to be easily dissolved.</p>
<p>When a person is ill and becomes mad, as if seeing ghosts, it is due to the deficiency of righteous energy and the invasion of邪 (evil). It seems appropriate to rectify the邪. However, since邪 gathers where energy is weak, if we do not treat the deficiency, how can we talk of the rest? Thus, it is urgent to support the righteous energy and lightly assist with medications to eliminate phlegm and邪. For those who see ghosts in madness, it is a deficiency. Therefore, use one tael each of ginseng and white atractylodes, three qian each of pinellia and tian nanxing, and one qian of aconite, and administer a large dose; the madness will calm itself.</p>
<p>For those who are mad, do not recognize people, and do not see ghosts, this signifies heat. They should not be given the previous decoction. Seeing ghosts indicates deficiency and not true heat, so the method includes ginseng, added to medications for eliminating phlegm and邪, as it is a reversal for treatment.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>

<p>Cured red ginseng, white poria, angelica (washed to remove dirt), acorus, and frankincense (grind separately), about five taels of sour jujube seeds (soak to remove the skin, fry the clean seeds until red, and fragrant).

<p>Forty pounds of raw iron, heated in the fire until red, are hammered on the anvil until flowers resembling orchids and moths emerge, falling to the ground. This is called iron drop.

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: when illness affects the various yang channels, accompanied by both cold and heat, in the various divisions, also presenting cold and heat, it is named mania. Needle the empty channels, observe the divisions; when excessive heat is evident, the illness will stop. If the illness initially occurs and is untreated once a year or monthly, with four to five episodes a month, it is called epilepsy. Needle into the various divisions and channels; of those without cold, adjust with needles, and the illness will cease. [The term &quot;illness has stopped&quot; originally read &quot;the illness has stopped,&quot; revised according to the &quot;Su Wen, on Long Needling.&quot;] Those with liver-fire conditions will have yellow urine at first, abdominal pain requiring rest, body heat, delusions, and agitation, fullness and pain in the flanks, restlessness in hands and feet, and inability to lie still. Excess of metal (Geng and Xin) leads to great sweating. If the qi is counterflowing, it leads to severe conditions. Needle the foot&#39;s jueyin and shaoyang. If counterflowing, headaches result, with a pulse surging toward the head.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: the branch of the foot yangming, named &quot;Fenglong,&quot; is located eight inches above the ankle and branches to the taiyin; its branch follows the outer edge of the tibia, links to the head and neck, and connects with the energies of the various channels, descending to interweave with the throat. When the illness manifests as qi counterflowing, it results in throat obstruction leading to sudden muteness; when excessive, it leads to mania and frenzy; when deficient, it causes the feet to be unresponsive and the shins to wither, found at the location of the branch.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>When a fit begins, it starts with a lack of joy, a heavy headache, and intense redness in the eyes when looking up. Afterward, there is restlessness and facial changes; one should feel the pulse at the Sun and Yangming points, and once the blood changes, it stops. </p>
<p>If a fit starts and is accompanied by crying or panting, feel the pulse at the Yangming and Sun points—if the left is strong, attack the right, and if the right is strong, attack the left; once the blood changes, it stops.</p>
<p>When a fit begins, it initially causes stiffness followed by spinal pain. Feel at the foot points of Sun and Yangming, and the hand points of Sun; once the blood changes, it stops.</p>
<p>For treating fits, remain close to the patient, observe where treatment should be applied. When the fit arises, examine; if there is excess, drain it, and place the blood in a gourd. When the episode occurs, if the blood moves on its own, it is effective; if not, perform moxibustion at the coccyx twenty times. &quot;The coccyx&quot; refers to the tailbone.</p>
<p>In cases of muscle fits, there will be fatigue and spasms; perform deep needling at the major points of the governing vessels. If there is vomiting and excessive foaming, and the qi is leaking down, it indicates a worse prognosis. </p>
<p>In pulse fits, there may be sudden collapse with distended pulses in all four limbs; if the pulse is full, deeply needle to draw blood; if it is not full, perform moxibustion at the points near the neck of the Sun, and moxibustion three inches from the waist along the belt channel. If there is vomiting and excessive foaming, and the qi is leaking down, it indicates a worse prognosis.</p>
<p>When mania first arises, it starts with sorrow and then forgets joy and bitterness; anger manifests as good fear leading to worries and hunger. Treatment seeks the points of the Taiyin and Yangming on the hands and feet; once the blood changes, it stops.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>When mania begins, one sleeps little and is not hungry; this comes from a high sense of worth, self-assertion, and self-respect. Those who are good at speaking abusively do so without rest, day and night. To treat this, one should use the hands in the Yangming, Sun, and Taiyin meridians, and the tongue in the Shaoyin. For those who are in a state of excess, take from them. If it is not excessive, let it go.</p>
<p>Manic speech causes surprise, laughter, and an unending desire to sing; those who act recklessly will experience great fear. To treat this, one should use the hands in the Yangming, Sun, and Taiyin meridians.</p>
<p>Those in a manic state see inaccurately with the eyes and hear inaccurately with the ears; those who call out are born of a lack of energy. To treat this, use the hands in the Sun, Taiyin, and Yangming channels, the feet in the Taiyin, and the head at the two temples.</p>
<p>A manic person often eats a lot, sees spirits and gods, and laughs without openly expressing it; they find great joy. To treat this, use the feet in the Taiyin, Sun, and Yangming channels, and later use the hands in the Taiyin, Sun, and Yangming.</p>
<p>If mania occurs suddenly and excessively, it should not be treated in this way. First, take from the left and right arteries of the Ququan point, particularly if there is an excess of blood, which happens after a while. If it does not stop, use methods to treat it. Moxibustion on the sacral bones to strengthen twenty times.</p>
<p>In cases of heat illness with repeated fright, with raving mania, check the pulse and use the fourth needle; if there is excessive diarrhea, be urgent in treatment.</p>
<p>In cases of epilepsy, where hair is lost and blood is sought from the heart, do not seek it in the water. Water pertains to the kidneys.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Intense heat spreads throughout the body, causing delusions, reckless visions, and irrational words.

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: A monk named Yunhui from the Tang Prime Minister’s temple suffered from insanity and loss of mind for half a year, having tried all famous doctors’ prescriptions without effect. His brother-in-law, from a wealthy family, invited Sun Simiao to treat him. Sun said: &quot;Tonight, while you sleep, you will be better by tomorrow.&quot; The brother-in-law replied: &quot;Just send the medicine, and I will remember your kindness.&quot; Sun said: &quot;Only give the monk some salty food to eat; when he gets thirsty, I will come.&quot; At midnight, the monk indeed felt thirsty. Sun arrived and requested a bowl of warm wine, mixing a dose of medicine for him. After a while, he asked for more wine, giving him half a bowl. The monk then slept for two days and nights before awakening, returning to normalcy. The brother-in-law thanked Sun and inquired about his method. Sun said: &quot;Many can calm the spirit, but few can make it dim enough to sleep. This is the &#39;Red Cinnabar, Sour Jujube Seed, and Frankincense Powder&#39; from the spiritual garden, which people cannot rely on to aid sleep.&quot; Likewise, Wu Gong, in his youth, suffered from a heart condition; after taking a dose from this prescription, he awoke five days later and was cured.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>The text from &quot;The Rites of Confucianism to Serve Parents&quot; states: A old man, aged sixty, suffered from the burdens of labor and became violently mad, with his mouth and nose feeling as if insects were crawling. He would scratch with both hands, and this persisted for several years. A physician diagnosed that both his wrists had strong pulses like thick ropes. The diagnosis was: the mouth is the &quot;flying gate,&quot; and the stomach is the &quot;entrance gate.&quot; The mouth is the upper source of the stomach. The nose is where the Foot Yangming meridian begins, connecting at the middle of the nose, alongside the Taiyang, descending along the nasal pillar, crossing the philtrum, encircling the lips, and joining the承浆. Thus, his ailment manifests in this way. The burdens of labor contribute to a fiery condition; fire rides on the Yangming meridian, resulting in madness. Hence, it is said in classical texts that when diseases of Yangming arise, one climbs high to sing, discards clothing, and insults without regard to family ties. Furthermore, the liver governs planning and the gallbladder governs decision-making. When labor is pressing and financial resources cannot sustain, the liver repeatedly plans but the gallbladder cannot decide, leading to a blockage without release. The heart fire becomes overwhelming, thus taking over the Yangming meridian. The stomach belongs to earth while the liver belongs to wood, and the gallbladder corresponds to the fire of mutual relations; this fire follows the energy of wood and enters the stomach, resulting in violent madness. He was commanded to be placed in a warm room, to sweat profusely, and this was repeated three times. The Inner Canon states: &quot;When wood is stagnant, it should be unblocked; when fire is stagnant, it should be unleashed.&quot; Indeed, this is the case. He was given half a pound of the Tiaogai Chengqi Decoction, boiled with five liters of water until half-done, divided into three doses, resulting in a major downward purge of twenty measures, with a mixture of blood and stagnant blood excreted, and upon retrieval, he was well. Subsequently, he was treated with Tongsheng Powder.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>The wife of Xiang Guanling was ill from hunger and did not want to eat. She often yelled and cursed, wanting to harm those around her, and her harsh words never ceased. All the doctors prescribed medicine, but after nearly half a year, she was still the same. A certain man said: &quot;This cannot be treated with medicine.&quot; So he had two courtesans apply red powder and act like performers, which made her laugh heartily. The next day, they staged a wrestling match, provoking more laughter. She often praised the food of two women who could eat well, and the sick woman asked for their food and tasted it. After a few days, her anger diminished and her appetite increased, and without medication, she recovered. Later, she bore a son. Physicians are valuable for their talent; without talent, they cannot adapt to endless changes.</p>
<p>A man fell from his horse and went mad. When he got up, he stared wildly and spoke incoherently, not recognizing kin or stranger, discarding his clothes and running away, cursing as he went. His strength increased, making it impossible for three or five people to restrain him. They burned talismans and performed rituals, asking shamans for guidance, but remained ignorant of the true situation. They tried various substances like cinnabar, ox gall, rhinoceros horn, pearls, amber, and musk, wasting their wealth as their room became desolate. They traveled nearly two hundred miles to find the same man. He buried the madman under the wheel of a cart, about two zhang high, securing it in the center with wheel components. A hole was made in the rim, shaped like a basin, and the madman was tied to it, lying down on a soft mat. Another person was instructed to sit below a machine and stir it with a stick, turning it thousands of times, making the patient vomit a couple of dou of green and yellow froth around the wheel. The madman said: &quot;I can&#39;t endure this; let me be released.&quot; He was set free as requested. They asked for cold water and gave him ice water to drink by several sheng, and only then did his madness subside.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>When a madman cannot withstand his yang, then his pulses become weak and he experiences a fainting spell; when yang is combined, he becomes mad. The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: excessive yang leads to madness, while excessive yin leads to insanity. Yang corresponds to the organs, and yin corresponds to the viscera. It is not that yang is hot and yin is cold; when heat combines in yang, it causes madness, and madness leads to cold; when combined in yin, it leads to insanity, and insanity results in death. The &quot;Nei Jing&quot; states: when the foot yangming is full, it leads to madness; thus, one climbs high and sings, discards clothing and runs, and does anything without restraint—this is the extreme of heat. To regulate the stomach and administer a great purging decoction, one should purge dozens of bowel movements; after three to five days, the fluid surges back up by one or two liters, and after another three to five days, it is purged again. After five to sixty days, purge more than a hundred times, and vomit seven or eight times. When vomiting occurs, keep a warm chamber with a fire, to assist the heat and reduce sweating, and after several sweats, balance will be restored.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>The text from &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: One year, after a day of drunken feasting, a disciple spoke irrationally, claiming to be possessed by the spirit of his deceased elder brother, recounting events from the brother&#39;s life with great detail. His uncle reprimanded him, saying it was not a spiritual issue, but rather the result of overindulgence in greasy food and alcohol, causing phlegm. After administering a large bowl of salt water, he expelled one or two liters of phlegm, sweated heavily, and slept soundly for a night, restoring his peace.</p>
<p>A woman from the Jin family, in her youth, attended a banquet during the hot month. When her aunt questioned her disordered seating, she felt embarrassed and ashamed, leading to the onset of her condition, during which her speech became incoherent. Among her ramblings, she repeatedly stated that &quot;I am not a servant,&quot; with a rapid and taut pulse. I said, &quot;This is not a spiritual issue but a sickness.&quot; I suggested treating her with remedies to tonify the spleen, clear heat, and resolve phlegm, assuring that she would recover in a few days. However, her family did not believe me and summoned several shamans to spray water and cast spells on her. After about ten days, she died. When asked why a condition that was not spiritual led to death when treated as such, I explained that during the hot month, the external environment was steamy and oppressive, while the internal environment was filled with stagnant heat, exacerbating her condition.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>Moreover, the old phlegm accumulated, combined with shame and gloom, what can be said of the phlegm and heat! Now, if startled by the measuring rod of the law, it startles the spirit and the blood becomes unsettled; if sprayed with the water of the law, it solidifies the body and tightens the skin, preventing sweat from draining away. If sweat does not drain, then the internal heat steams and burns, and if the blood is not settled, then the yin withers and the yang cannot stand alone—how can one survive this? Some say that the &quot;Secret Essentials of the External Chamber&quot; contains forbidden incantations; should they be abandoned? I say: transforming essence into qi is merely a minor skill, suitable for treating small ailments. However, if there is internal deficiency and external excess, one must use the grand and righteous methods, which have established patterns that are clearly verifiable. Furthermore, talismanic water only addresses heat and phlegm in the diaphragm; a sip of cool water relieves stomach heat, surely it brings comfort? It can also be used for tranquility. However, if there is internal injury and deficiency, akin to enduring severe cold in winter, swallowing talismanic water will assuredly freeze the stomach and cause harm. When there is heat trapped internally, and evil heat on the surface, it is necessary to relieve it through sweat; if one does not attain clarity and coolness, with the skin pores tightly sealed, how can the heat be resolved? This will surely lead to an internal attack, causing the yin and yang to scatter and the vital blood and qi to clash—death is imminent.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>The &quot;Treasure of Hygiene&quot; states: In the year of Jia Yin, in the fourth month, I traveled to the boundary river and stayed there. A patient from Chou Siew Wen had been ill for five to seven days, raving wildly, tearing off his clothes and running away, calling out without regard for kin or stranger, and offering milk to others. People at the time said that the wind demon had come. The shaman prayed for him, but it only worsened his condition. The emperor heard of this and ordered me to treat him. I found six distinct pulses, and for several days, he could not defecate and was very thirsty, craving milk. I considered that in the northern regions, due to high cold and dense pores, there are few who suffer from cold-induced illness. However, the weather was fluctuating, causing exposure to cold evils and failure to relieve the condition, leading to a Yangming syndrome with fullness in the stomach, delirium, and, additionally, eating mutton to bolster the heat, which resulted in the two heats combining. This is called severe Yang madness, where Yang predominates and relief is urgent. Thus, I administered a large dose of the Da Cheng Qi Decoction with 1.5 liang of Huanglian, boiled in water for him to take. That night, he had several bowel movements, expelling over twenty pieces of dry stool, and he sweated and began to recover. The next day, I visited him again; he was cool to the touch and had a steady pulse. Everyone was delighted, exclaiming that Dr. Luo Qianfu had effectively treated the wind demon. From this, one can see that treating cold damage is not comparable to treating mixed diseases; the six channels differ, and each transmission varies. When diagnosing and uncertain, one does not know the source of the illness and instead insults and defames each other. Alas! The greed for fame and excessive attachment to reputation are shameful in the pursuit of knowledge. When will this illness ever be cured?<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>&quot;The Essentials of Medicine&quot; states: A woman from Zhejiang was continuously insane. The doctor ground half a tael of gourd seeds into powder, administered each dose weighing a qian, mixed with well water to fill a cup and gave it to her. She subsequently experienced a great vomiting. After vomiting, she fell into a deep sleep; she was not to be disturbed, and from then on, she remained well.</p>
<p>A patient named Xu suffered from Yang rejection, displaying madness and rage, cursing indiscriminately, whether towards kin or strangers, sometimes crying or singing. The six pulses were weak upon inspection, her body felt like ice, and she would yell loudly if disturbed. Jie Gu stated: If we deprive her of food, it would suffice, thus we did not give her any to eat. I used the Major Order the Qi Decoction to purge her, resulting in several sheng of filthy matter expelled from her internal organs, and her madness moderately settled. After a few days, it recurred, and I purged her again. This was done five or seven times, leading to the expulsion of several dou of feces, and she was cured; her body became warm, and her pulse was restored, achieving complete recovery. This is the method of remedying through food deprivation.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>In the year of Wushen, a man committed a crime and was stripped of his clothes; he was about to be punished when he was released. His spirit suddenly lost its clarity, as if he were mad. I gave him a pill for shock and fear, which he took and then fell asleep. Upon waking, his illness was gone.</p>
<p>Zhang Zaiyang, a deputy, had a wife who lost her mind due to fear of bandits; this had lasted for several years. I prescribed a pill for shock and fear, and she was cured before completing the dose.</p>
<p>Huang Yanqi’s wife had been mad and convulsing for over ten years, with no remedy providing results. I prescribed a pill for shock and fear, removing the aconite and adding iron powder. She too was cured before finishing the dose.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Guide&quot; states that a girl of fifteen, upset by anger, suffered from reversed speech, wanted to bite and hit people, secretly hid things, laughed and cried intermittently, felt fearful and timid, and could not distinguish hunger from satiety, experienced heat in her body. I treated her with Fangfeng Tongsheng San, adding raw Rehmannia and peony root; after two doses, she calmed down.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Thousand Diseases Returning to Spring&quot; recounts a woman who went mad, discarded her clothes, jumped over walls and rooftops, did not recognize friends or family, spoke wildly, and could not be restrained by others. The doctors were at a loss, and I instructed her family to pour cold water on her chaotically. She was doused numerous times and soon fell down. Upon examining her pulse, all six positions were strong and taut, indicating extreme heat producing wind. I administered Fangfeng Tongsheng San, adding raw Rehmannia, yellow lumbricus, peach kernel, safflower, and peony root; she calmed down after three doses. Later, I prescribed the treasured pill to expel wind, and she was fully cured.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases&quot; states: A servant fell ill in May with fever, dry mouth, dry lips, and delirium. His pulse was thin and slow. He was given a dose of Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Astragalus, Angelica, Peony, and cooked Aconite. After administration, the fever intensified, leading to more delirium and rampant behavior. Some suggested that Aconite was incorrectly used. Upon checking the pulse, it remained the same, so the Aconite was increased, and a large dose was administered. This resulted in sweating, the fever subsided, and the pulse normalized. </p>
<p>The King of Heaven treated a patient with a yellow complexion all over, wild speech, chest pain, and an avoidance of touch. The accumulation of blood in the middle jiao was the problem; he was given a dose of Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction, which expelled the stagnant blood and restored health. </p>
<p>The governor of Zhumountain&#39;s brother went mad due to abundant blood; he was treated successfully with Didao Decoction. </p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; mentions that Hua Boren treated a monk who was delirious and hallucinating, seeing people as ghosts. His pulse was excessive and slippery, and he was panting. It was determined that he had a full condition of the Yangming stomach. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: &quot;Yangming governs inside, with an abundance of both blood and qi, leading to extreme states like discarding clothes, climbing higher, and shouting wildly.&quot; Therefore, he took Sanhua Decoction three to four times, followed by a fire-clearing formula, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>A person during lunch suddenly grabbed a handful of hot coals from the stove and furiously swallowed them, while also muttering and shouting at others. Those nearby helped and checked his pulse, which was string-like and moving straight up and down, while the pulse at the left wrist was particularly floating and slippery, indicating wind-phlegm obstructing the heart orifices. The method was to bring forth the phlegm and concentrate the spirit. After discharging four to five liters of phlegm, he fell into a deep sleep and awoke the next day, at which point the illness had resolved.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　狂者，狂乱而无正定。越者，乖越礼法而失常也。夫外清而内浊，动乱参差，火之体；静顺清朗，准则信平，水之体。由是肾水主志而水火相反，故心火旺则肾水衰，乃失志而狂越。或云重阳者狂，重阴者癫，则《素问》之说不同也。经注曰：多喜为癫，多怒为狂。然喜为心志，故心热甚则多喜而为癫；怒为肝志，火实制金不能平木，故肝实则多怒而为狂。况五志所发皆为热，故狂者五志间发，但怒多尔。凡热于中则多干阳明胃经。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>经曰：阳明之厥则癫疾欲走，腹满不得卧，面赤而热，妄言。又曰：阳明病洒洒振寒，善伸数欠，或恶人与火，闻木音则惕然而惊，心欲动，独闭户牖而处，欲上高而歌，弃衣而走，贲响腹胀，骂詈不避亲疏。又经曰：热中消中，皆富贵人也。今禁膏粱是不合其心，禁芳草石药是病不愈，愿闻其说。岐伯曰：芳草之气美，石药之气悍，二者其气急疾坚劲，故非性缓心和人不可服此二者。夫热气慓悍，药气亦然。二者相遇，恐内伤脾。盖服膏粱芳草石药，则热气坚劲疾利而为热中消中，发为癫狂之疾。夫岂癫为重阴者欤？<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　　　　骂詈</p>
<p>　　言为心之声也。骂詈，言之恶也。夫水数一，道近而善；火数二，道远而恶。水者内清明而外不彰，器之方员，物之气味，五臭五色，从而不违，静顺信平，润下而善利万物，涤洗浊秽以清净，故上善若水。水火相反，则下愚如火也。火者外明耀而内烦浊，燔焫万物，为赤为热，为苦为焦，以从其已，躁乱参差，炎上而烈害万物，熏燎鲜明以为昏昧。水生于金而复润母燥，火生于木而反害母形。故《易》曰：润万物者莫过乎水。又言离火为戈兵。故火上有水制之，则为既济。水在火下，不能制火，为未济也。是知水善火恶。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>而今病阳盛阴虚，则水弱火强，制金不能平木，而善去恶发，骂詈不避亲疏，喜笑恚怒而狂，本火热之所生也。平人怒骂亦同。或本心喜而无怒，以为戏弄之骂，亦心火之用也。故怒骂者亦兼心喜骂于人也；怒而恶发可嗔者，内心喜欲怒于人也。　　伤寒发狂奔走，骂詈不避亲疏，此阳有余阴不足，三一承气汤加当归、姜枣，名当归承气汤，以利数行；候微缓，以三圣散吐之；后用凉膈散、洗心散、黄连解毒汤调之。讝妄发狂，逾垣上屋，赴井投河，皆为阳热极甚，用三一承气合解毒下之。惊悸癫狂，三一承气汤。发狂极甚，投河入井者，三下不通，不可下攻，便当涌之以瓜蒂散，吐出痰涎宿物，一扫而愈；后以甘露饮之类调之。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>　　　　明理论 【金　成无己】</p>

<p>　　伤寒发狂，本阳明实热之病。然复有如狂证者，虽似狂而实非狂，此中虚实相反，最宜详辨，不可忽也。凡实热之狂，本属阳明。盖阳明为多气多血之经，阳邪传入胃腑，热结不解，因而发狂。《内经》阳明脉解篇曰：胃者土也，故闻木音而惊者，土恶木也。其恶火者，热甚则恶火也。其恶人者，以阳明厥则喘而惋，惋则恶人也。其病甚则弃衣而走，登高而歌，或数日不食，或逾垣上屋者，以四肢为诸阳之本，阳盛则四肢实，实则能登高也。其弃衣而走者，以热甚于身也。其妄言骂詈，不避亲疏而歌者，以阳盛为邪也。又曰：阴不胜其阳，则脉流薄疾，并乃狂。又曰：邪入于阳则狂。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>是皆以阳明热邪上乘心肺，故令神志昏乱若此。此阳狂也。然伤寒病至发狂，是为邪热已极，使非峻逐火邪则不能已。故但察其大便鞕结，或腹满而坚，有可攻之证，则宜以大小承气，或凉膈散、六一顺气汤之类下之可也。如无胀满实坚等证，而惟胃火致然者，则但以白虎汤、抽薪饮之类泄去火邪，其病自愈。　　如狂证本非实热发狂，其证亦有轻重。如仲景曰：太阳病不解，热结膀胱，其人如狂，其外不解者，尚未可攻，当先解外；外已解，但少腹急结者，乃可攻之，宜桃仁承气汤。又曰：太阳病六七日，表证仍在，脉微而沉，反不结胸，其人如狂者，以热在下焦，少腹当鞕满，小便自利者，下其血乃愈，抵当汤主之。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>按此二条以太阳热邪不解，随经入腑，但未至发狂，故曰如狂。此以热搏血分，蓄聚下焦，故宜下也。　　近见伤寒家则别有如狂之证，古人所未及言者。盖或由失志而病，其病在心也；或由悲忧而病，其病在肺也；或由失精而病，其病在肾也；或由劳倦思虑而病，其病在肝脾也。此其本病已伤于内，而寒邪复感于外，则病必随邪而起矣。其证如狂，亦所谓虚狂也。而虚狂之证，必外无黄赤之色，刚暴之气，内无胸腹之结，滑实之脉，虽或不时躁扰，而禁之则止，口多妄诞而声息不壮，或眼见虚空，或惊惶不定，察其上则口无焦渴，察其下则便无鞕结，是皆精气受伤，神魂不守之证，此与阳极为狂者，反如冰炭。<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>而时医不能察，但见错乱便谓阳狂，妄行攻泻，必致杀人。凡治此者，须辨阴阳。其有虚而挟邪者，邪在阳分，则宜补中益气汤之类；邪在阴分，则宜补阴益气煎之类。虚而无邪者，在阳分，则宜四君、八珍、十全大补汤大补元煎之类；在阴分，则宜四物、六味、左归饮、一阴煎之类。阴虚挟火者，宜加减一阴煎、二阴煎之类；阳虚挟寒者，宜理中汤、回阳饮、八味汤、右归饮之类等方治之。然大略如此，而变证之异，则有言不能传者。能知意在言表，则知所未言矣。　　凡身有微热，或面赤带黄，或烦躁不宁，欲坐卧于泥水中，然脉则微弱无力，此阴证似阳也，名为阴躁。盖以阳虚于下，则气不归原，故浮散于上而发躁如狂，速当温补其下，命门暖则火有所归，而病当自愈。若医不识此，而误用寒凉者，必死。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>

<p><strong>On Madness</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>A General Analysis of the Theory of Void and Substance</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What is the nature of madness? Qi Bo replied: The pulse is large and slippery, persisting for a long time; if the pulse is small, firm, and rapid, it indicates death without treatment. The Emperor asked: What is the nature of the pulse in cases of madness, in terms of void and substance? Qi Bo replied: If it is void, it can be treated; if it is substantial, it leads to death.<br>[Note: A large pulse indicates abundant energy outward; a small, firm, and rapid pulse indicates energy leaking downward.]</p>
<p><strong>On Unusual Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What is the name of the illness that causes madness in a person? How does one acquire it? Qi Bo replied: It is termed a fetal disease. This is acquired while in the mother’s womb, when the mother experiences a sudden shock, causing the energy to rise rather than descend, and thus the vital essence remains entangled, resulting in the child developing madness.<br>[Note: A sudden shock causes energy to violently rise without descending. As the essence nourishes the fetus and remains entangled, if the mother is startled and her energy rises, then the child&#39;s vital essence also goes awry, leading to madness.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When clothing does not cover the body, and speech of good and evil does not avoid relationships of kinship or distance, this is a disruption of the divine spirit. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: When the Yangming condition is severe, one abandons clothing to run, climbs high to sing, and may go days without food, leaping over walls and rooftops—what enables this, which is beyond their usual capability? Qibo replied: The limbs are the root of all Yang; when Yang is abundant, the limbs are robust, and when robust, one is capable of climbing high. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What causes one to abandon clothing and run? Qibo replied: It is due to excessive heat in the body, which compels one to shed clothes and desire to run. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about those who speak wildly and insult, not avoiding relations of kinship or distance, and sing? Qibo replied: When Yang is abundant, it causes one to speak wildly and insult without regard for kinship, and to have no desire for food, which leads to wild running. </p>
<p>This is because the stomach channel connects to the heart; when Yang is abundant, the spirit becomes confused, hence causing such wild speech and insults, disregarding kinship.

<p>The excessive yang of the taiyang (Greater Yang) leads to mania and peak illness, where yang is fully above, and yin is below; the lower part is empty while the upper part is solid, hence the mania and peak illness.<br><em>[Note: Mania and peak illness occur because the yang energy is excessively above while the yin energy is below, unable to harmonize with the yang; thus, the lower part is hollow and the upper part is substantial, resulting in mania and peak illness.]</em></p>
<p>The yangming (Greater Brightness) states that when sickness reaches a peak, one feels inclined to ascend high and sing, discarding clothing and running away; this is due to the struggle between yin and yang, with the external façade contending with the yang, causing such behavior.<br><em>[Note: The struggle between yin and yang refers to the yin and yang energies being thin and fighting within and without.

<p>The Emperor asked: What causes the illness of anger and madness? Qi Bo replied: It arises from Yang. The Emperor asked: How does Yang cause madness?

Qi Bo replied: The Yangming stage is always in motion, while Ju Yang and Shao Yang are at rest; when they do not move but emotions surge, it results in severe illness, which is the manifestation. The Emperor asked: How is it treated? Qi Bo replied: Simply depriving it of food will suffice. Food enters Yin, nourishing Qi in Yang, therefore depriving it of food will be enough.

The Qi of food enters the stomach, dispersing essence to the liver, while turbid Qi returns to the heart, producing disorder in the vessels, with fine vessels gathering essence, circulating Qi in the bowels; hence food enters Yin and nurtures Qi in Yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Meridian Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The stomach meridian of the foot Yangming causes, when active, illness characterized by chills and a scattered feeling, a propensity to groan and frequent yawning, a dark complexion, and when illness strikes, aversion to dark places and fire, and a startle response to wooden sounds. The heart feels restless, leading one to shut doors and windows and remain enclosed. In severe cases, there is a desire to ascend and sing, to cast off clothing and run. Distention and rumbling of the abdomen signal a state known as &quot;knee constriction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Yangming corresponds to midday, and when in the presence of Yin energy, chills and a scattered sensation occur. The tendency to groan reflects a Yang energy that is suppressed and seeking to express itself. Frequent yawning indicates a yearning upward of Yang. A dark complexion points to an excess of Yin above. When illness arrives, it affects the meridians. Among the diseases of the Yangming meridian, there is a dislike for dark places and fire; the sound of wood startles. The stomach network connects upward to the heart, hence the heart&#39;s unrest. The interaction of Yin and Yang leads to a desire to remain enclosed. When Yang is abundant, the limbs feel firm, and the urge to climb and sing arises. An excess of heat causes one to discard clothing and run. The Yangming meridian&#39;s obstruction leads to rumbling and distension linked to the stomach and spleen network.</p>
<p>The bladder meridian of the foot Taiyang primarily governs illnesses arising from the tendons, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, and seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Yang energy nurtures the tendons when mild, which results in conditions like hemorrhoids. If the meridians are deficient internally, it may lead to malaria.

<p>In cases of madness stemming from bone-related ailments, there are symptoms such as the teeth and flesh around the joints being full while the bones are empty, with profuse sweating and anxiety, frequent vomiting of frothy saliva, and a downward flow of energy that cannot be treated. [Note: The teeth are remnants of bone, and the flesh corresponds to the bone; hence, in cases of madness linked to the bones, the teeth and surrounding flesh are abundant, while the bones are lacking in connection. The excessive sweating and anxiety stem from a disease affecting the Kidney of the Lesser Yin from the foot, which ascends to influence the Heart of the Lesser Yin in the hand. The frequent vomiting of frothy saliva indicates a derangement of Taiyin and Yangming energies. The downward flow of energy signifies leakage from the Lesser Yin.

<p><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinction Between Mania and Delirium</strong></p>
<p>The twentieth difficulty states: Excess yang leads to mania, while excess yin leads to delirium. When lacking yang, one perceives ghosts; when lacking yin, one becomes blind. The fifty-ninth difficulty states: How can one distinguish between mania and delirium? Indeed, in the onset of mania, there is little sleep and lack of hunger, an attitude of superiority and discernment, an air of arrogance, excessive laughter and enjoyment of music, ceaseless wandering; these are the signs. At the onset of delirium, one feels no joy, appears stiff and stares blankly; their pulse shows both yin and yang are excessively strong.</p>
<p><strong>Jin Kui Yao Lue</strong> (by Zhang Ji of the Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Delirium</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on the five zang states: If the evil cry causes the spirit to be unsettled, it signifies a deficiency of blood and qi. A deficiency in blood and qi relates to the heart. When the heart qi is deficient, the person feels fearful, desires sleep with closed eyes, dreams of distant travels, and the spirit is scattered, causing the soul to wander. A decline in yin qi leads to delirium, while a decline in yang qi leads to mania. The chapter on phlegm and fluids states: If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel, spits foam, and becomes delirious and dizzy, this is due to water, and it is governed by Wu Ling San.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Madness</strong></p>
<p>The illness that arises from the six viscera is associated with the Yang energies. It may manifest in various ways: sometimes outwardly, sometimes inwardly, sometimes disrupted, or sometimes in the extremes. Some individuals can sing and laugh, while others can weep; some may run about, and others may sigh; some may exhibit twisted postures, while others consider themselves noble. Some are awake yet cannot sleep; others may lose their ability to speak but make sounds without meaning. Each case is different, but all arise from the six viscera. If one finds joy in their condition, treat them accordingly; if their condition is blocked, address the block; if they enjoy water, provide water; if they find comfort in coolness, then provide coolness. The pleasure and preferences of the patient should not be opposed nor forcibly restrained. By following this principle, healing can be found in all cases, ten times for ten individuals, hundreds for hundreds—no ailment remains that cannot be cured. </p>
<p>Symptoms of heart disturbance may involve excessive sweating, a desire to lie flat without moving or turning, and speaking with delusions. For such patients, it is advisable to apply moxibustion to the heart. If the lips and face show varied colors—blue, white, yellow, black, or red—and if the eyes are unable to settle, while the heart is critically weakened, then there is no hope for recovery, and after five days, death is inevitable.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Tight Pulse Song says: &quot;The tight pulse at three gates counts the strings, the incoming wind is the root source. Suddenly, mad words cause fear, without encountering a good doctor, recovery is impossible.&quot; </p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Diseases of Life and Death Song says: &quot;The disease of confusion leads to madness, yet the pulse is firm and safe. At the inch and cun positions, it feels heavy and fine, as such, I have not heard of anyone saved.&quot;</p>
<h3>Treatment for Madness</h3>
<p>Xu Sibai said: &quot;In my youth, I inherited the family business and studied classical formulas, hearing from famous doctors regarding treatments. I believe dizziness caused by wind is multifactorial; many schools do not guarantee efficacy, and on this technique, my humble opinion is particularly focused. I have used it recently, with no missed strategies. This year, as I face decline, I fear it may abruptly take me, hence I clearly discuss it for future reference. </p>
<p>The disease of dizziness arises from unstable heart qi, with accumulation in the chest, hence it is caused by high winds and heated faces. When phlegm and heat interact, it stirs up wind; when wind and heart are in disarray, it causes confusion—hence the term wind dizziness. In adults, it is termed madness, while in children, it is classified as epilepsy, yet fundamentally, they are one and the same.</p>
<p>This prescription for treatment is guaranteed to cure; however, fears may arise from misdiagnosis or misalignment. Generally, avoid eating flesh from the twelve classifications; pig meat causes issues, leading to excessive gas and urgency, which can lead to inevitable death. Thus, this one decoction is appropriate for conditions of lightness and heaviness; do not hastily label it as an ineffective remedy.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>All diseases caused by hundreds of evils originate from various paths, exhibiting numerous forms.

Some may wander about day and night, rage without restraint, or exhibit signs of insect-like spirits, appearing frantic and agitated.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The harmful effects of wind on those who have been suffering for a long time can lead to joint pain and result in madness; this must not be overlooked. Throughout history, regardless of wealth or status, many have suffered from this. This is the toxicity of wind, and while there are remedies such as herbal medicine, they do not compare to the efficacy of pine resin or pine spirit. For those who are traveling and cannot afford immediate treatment, it is advisable to take various herbal decoctions, which are better than no treatment at all, but it is also beneficial to apply moxibustion at painful areas with three-seven moxa. </p>
<p>In cases of madness, there is a desire to escape or a tendency to claim oneself as a sage or divine being, which requires moxibustion for effective treatment and the possibility of a lasting cure. However, if there is sorrowful crying or moaning, this is caused by a pathogen rather than madness, and one should treat it according to the specific affliction. When pathogens invade the yang, it leads to madness; when they invade the yin, it results in stasis of blood. A pathogen entering the yang manifests as insanity, while one entering the yin results in silence and pain.

<p>This is known as yang poison. If the febrile illness has an excess of yang energy while yin energy is completely depleted, it will inevitably lead to madness, restlessness, fevered speech, facial redness, sore throat, and skin mottled like brocade. There may also be red and yellow diarrhea, with a pulse that is surging and full or slippery and rapid.

<p>In cases of solar disease with madness, the heat is located in the lower abdomen, causing hardness and fullness in the lower abdomen, followed by blood discharge which can lead to recovery. There are two types of madness; one from yang poison and the other from accumulated blood. Their external symptoms and pulse characteristics differ.

This is indeed a blood condition.

In severe cases, one may need to use decoctions like Di Dang Tang or pills like Di Dang Wan; in milder cases, use Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang or Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, ensuring to eliminate all black substances for effect. There are also cases where fire pathogens cause shock and madness; the physician may use fire beneath the bed, or apply heat to the entire body to force out sweat. If the person has lost Yang, they may exhibit agitation and madness, unable to rest or sleep peacefully.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Six Writings of Hejian</strong><br><strong>(by Liu Wanshu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madness and Excess</strong></p>
<p>Madness is characterized by chaos and a lack of stability. Excess refers to deviating from rituals and laws, resulting in a loss of propriety. When the outside is clear but the inside is turbid, with movements being chaotic, it resembles the nature of fire; conversely, when calm and clear, adhering to standards and maintaining balance, it reflects the nature of water. Thus, the kidney (water) governs will, and since water and fire are opposites, an abundance of heart fire leads to a diminishment of kidney water, resulting in a loss of will and madness. Some say that the excessive Yang corresponds to madness, while excessive Yin corresponds to mania; this differs from what is stated in the &quot;Suwen.&quot; The commentaries say: excessive joy leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Joy relates to the will of the heart, therefore, when the heart is intensely warm, there is much joy resulting in mania; anger relates to the will of the liver, as the fire of the liver suppresses metal and cannot maintain balance with wood, thus a strong liver results in much anger and madness. Moreover, all five emotions arise from heat, hence madness is an expression of these five emotions, predominantly anger. Generally, heat within leads to abundance in the Yangming stomach channel.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

It also mentions that the illness of yangming can lead to trembling with cold, frequent yawning, an aversion to people and fire, becoming startled by the sound of wood, an anxious heart, and a tendency to close oneself off, desiring to climb high and sing, shedding clothing and running, with a rumbling belly and cursing indiscriminately without regard for kinship. Furthermore, it is noted in the texts: those who have heat and are affected are generally wealthy and noble. Currently, prohibiting rich food is contrary to their desires, and forbidding fragrant herbs and mineral medicines leads to the illness not being cured; I wish to hear your explanation. Qibo replies: The aroma of fragrant herbs is pleasant, while the scent of mineral medicines is aggressive; both have an urgent and strong energy, thus, only those with a calm disposition and harmonious heart can take these two. The heat energy is fierce, and the medicinal energy is similar. When the two meet, there is a risk of internal injury to the spleen. Taking rich foods, fragrant herbs, and mineral medicines would cause this fierce heat to become strong and aggressive, leading to manic episodes.

<p>Words are the voice of the heart. Insult and abuse are words of malice. Water is singular in nature; it is close and good; fire is dual, distant and evil. Water is clear and bright internally but not externally prominent. It takes the shape of vessels, embodies the essence and flavors of things, adheres without deviation to five odors and five colors, remains tranquil, harmonious, and balanced, moistens and benefits all living things, cleansing impurities to achieve purity, thus the highest goodness is like water. Water and fire are opposites, and the foolish resemble fire. Fire is brilliant externally but chaotic and murky internally, consuming all things, bringing heat and bitterness, and in its own way creates disturbance and disorder, ascending violently to damage all things, clouding clarity and leading to darkness. Water emerges from metal and moistens what is dry; fire arises from wood and harms its source. Therefore, the Book of Changes states: “Nothing moistens all things like water.” It also refers to fire as weaponry. Thus, when water is above fire, it indicates a completed situation; when water is below fire, it cannot control fire, indicating an incomplete situation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Currently, there is an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin, resulting in weak water and strong fire. The metal cannot balance the wood, and negative emotions arise; insults do not spare kin or strangers alike, while joy, laughter, irritation, and anger emerge chaotically—all manifestations of the fire within. Common people’s anger and insults are similar. Some may express joy without anger, thinking of it as playful taunting; this too is the use of inner fire. Thus, those who curse in anger also harbor joy in cursing others; anger accompanied by negativity can indicate an inner desire to express anger towards others.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to mania and running about, cursing without regard for kin or strangers indicates an excess of yang and deficiency of yin. The formula known as &quot;Daungui Chengqi Decoction,&quot; which combines &quot;Chengqi Decoction&quot; with angelica, ginger, and jujube, is used to promote continuous movement.

<p><strong>(by Jin Chengwuji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Madness from Febrile Illness</strong></p>
<p>How can we explain madness resulting from febrile illness? Madness signifies unruliness, indicating a state of unrest. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: When madness first arises, there may be little sleep and no hunger; it is characterized by self-proclaimed wisdom, efforts to distinguish oneself, arrogance, vain laughter, a love for music, and restless wandering. Madness arises from excessive Yang energy. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: When Yin cannot overcome Yang, the pulse becomes weak and illness arises, resulting in madness. It also states: If pathogens enter through Yang, madness occurs; if they enter through Yin, it leads to muteness. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; further states: Excessive Yang leads to madness, while excessive Yin leads to delirium. The &quot;Maijing&quot; states: Yin attached to Yang leads to madness, while Yang attached to Yin leads to delirium. The &quot;Disease Origins&quot; states: Yang pathogens accompanying Yang result in madness, while Yin pathogens accompanying Yin lead to delirium. Thus, the madness described in various classics clearly indicates the predominance of Yang energy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of Yangming disease, the patient, like a wicked person faced with fire, is startled by the sound of wood, their heart desires to move. They may close doors and windows, and if the condition worsens, they might want to climb high and sing, throwing off their clothing and leaping over walls, going to places they normally cannot reach. This is called the Yang evil combining with Yangming. When there is cold damage and heat toxins in the stomach, affecting the heart, it disturbs the spirit and makes the will unstable, leading to madness. When cold damage reaches the stage of madness, it signifies the extreme of evil heat; only major purging or vomiting can alleviate it. </p>
<p>Additionally, there can be heat in the lower jiao, making the person appear mad. The classic says: when heat enters the bladder, the person seems mad. This appearance of madness suggests they are not truly mad, but restless when lying down or getting up. They may speak wildly, have eyes that reflexively stare straight ahead, which indicates a weakness of the kidneys. Sweating without relief suggests renewed heat, and speaking wildly implies a loss of will, leading to death. In such cases, it is likely beyond the reach of medicinal stone, indicating a true illness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Mad Words and Delirious Speech: A Discussion on Zheng Sound</h3>
<p>Mad speech refers to wide-open eyes, speaking to others about matters never before seen, thus it is termed mad speech. Delirious speech involves closed eyes and self-talk about commonly seen and practiced matters, hence it is recognized as delirious speech. Zheng sound is weak in battle, disconnected, and the characters are produced from the throat, thus it is called Zheng sound.</p>
<h3>Madness and Mania</h3>
<p>Madness is associated with yin, while mania is associated with yang. Madness often brings joy, whereas mania frequently elicits anger. A weak pulse can be treated; if it is strong, it is fatal. Generally, this condition stems from phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest, so treatment should calm the mind and remove the phlegm. There are also those who develop this illness due to possession by evil spirits, in which case, treat it with methods to dispel the evil. The discussion in the &quot;Treatise on Original Diseases&quot; is particularly precise, affirming what the world calls heavy yin corresponds to madness, and heavy yang corresponds to mania. Generally, these are symptoms of heat. </p>
<p>In madness, the spirit is not at rest, words spoken seem to draw from visions, lasting for years without cure, damaging the heart, which is a true ailment. If the heart is filled with heat, it should be purified; if phlegm obscures the mind, it is necessary to expel the phlegm and calm the spirit. If there is weeping and groaning due to possession, this is not mania, but rather a treatment involving burning mulberry paper and administering small amounts of wine. </p>
<p>Wind-induced madness brings pain to the chest, causing ringing in the ears, for which Tianmeng Dong can be used to soothe the heart, ground into powder and taken with wine in small doses. </p>
<p>Madness is to be treated in spring, alleviating itself by summer, and medicines that support heart qi should be used. Yang deficiency with yin excess leads to madness, while yin deficiency with yang excess leads to mania. For mania, significant purging and downward treatment is essential.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Mania and Madness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: When the Yangming channel is blocked, one experiences mania with desires to run and call out, a full abdomen that prevents sleep, a red and heated face, and delusions and irrational speech. It further notes that in severe cases, individuals may discard their clothing, climb high to sing, leap over walls and roofs, and curse indiscriminately without regard for kinship. This arises from an excess of Yang energy, with heat and dryness of the stomach and large intestine accumulating within. These are the symptoms of mania and madness. </p>
<p>The terms “mania” and “madness” suggest different conditions, don&#39;t they? The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that an excess of Yin leads to mania, whereas an excess of Yang leads to madness. The annotations of the &quot;Suwen&quot; indicate that excessive joy leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Thus, joy pertains to the heart, while anger pertains to the liver, indicating an excess of fire from these two organs.</p>
<p>The Yin-Yang theory of the &quot;Nanjing&quot; may not be entirely accurate. Generally, madness is characterized by an abundance of phlegm-fire, whereas mania is attributed to insufficient heart blood, often seen in individuals with lofty aspirations that are unachieved. Madness may be treated with grounding therapies, while mania should involve calming the spirit and nourishing the blood, with a focus on reducing phlegm-fire. However, these two conditions, when accompanied by vacant expressions and wide-eyed stares resembling foolishness, leave me at a loss as to how to proceed.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Someone asked, &quot;The Inner Canon says that when the Yangming disease is severe, one discards their clothes and runs, climbs high to sing, or may not eat for several days yet leaps over walls and roofs. The places where one ascends are beyond what is normally possible. How can it be that one cannot eat due to illness but is still able to reach extraordinary heights? Is this possible?&quot; It was replied, &quot;The Classic of Difficulties states: &#39;Excess yang leads to madness, excess yin leads to mania.&#39; It also mentions that those with mania are often joyful, while those with madness are often filled with anger. The so-called excess yang means the three full Yin-Yang pulses are vigorous and strong, hence the illness appears robust and powerful, leading to the term &#39;madness.&#39; Excess yin means the three full Yin-Yang pulses are suppressed and thin; thus, the illness manifests as fatigue and lack of strength, leading to the term &#39;mania.&#39; </p>
<p>I once saw a young man from Dongyang who was mad. One day, during a strong wind, he suddenly flew to the top of a tower in the east of the city, singing and crying. The tower had no steps to climb, and everyone viewed it as a wonder. I think of the dragon, a pure yang creature that lies hidden in the sea; its body only has scales and armor, and it lacks wings. On days when the yang energy rises, it borrows the force of the wind and clouds to soar. This is the meaning here. Why should it be deemed strange?</p>
<p>Regarding pulse diagnosis:</p>
<p>A pulse that is large, hard, and rapid indicates mania; a sinking, rapid pulse suggests phlegm-heat. A large, slippery pulse indicates self-reliance; a sinking, small, rapid pulse is a sign of death; a weak, taut, rapid pulse is also fatal. When the cun pulse is large and slippery, if it sinks it indicates a solid condition, and if it is slippery it indicates qi. When solid and qi clash, death occurs if it enters the zang organs but can heal if it enters the fu organs.&quot;<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essential Methods for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madness and Mania</strong></p>
<p>Madness and mania arise from the stagnation of emotions, leading to the production of phlegm and saliva, which block the heart&#39;s orifices, causing a loss of self-awareness. The eyes stare without blinking, there is nonsensical speech and cursing, and at times, individuals may leap over walls or rooftops, attacking others naked. The treatment aims to resolve phlegm and calm the heart: it is advisable to use a formula such as &quot;Chen Sha Miao Xiang San&quot; with gold foil and pearl powder, mixed with the powdered Baiwanzi from Qingzhou, and taken with strong ginger decoction, swallowing fourteen pills. There’s also &quot;Huashi Liuyi Decoction&quot; with pearl powder, taken with plain broth. Those suffering from derangement should take &quot;Siqi Decoction&quot; to recover. Phlegm causes confusion because of its obstruction and, in cases of amnesia, palpitations, or stupor with seizures, this remedy should similarly be used. If madness is unstable and cannot be cured by lighter remedies, then &quot;Taiyi Ointment&quot; and &quot;Baodan Pill&quot; should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Wind</strong></p>
<p>Heart Wind refers to a state of spirit confusion, with fluctuating joy and anger, occasional speechlessness, and erratic behavior resembling madness, though less intense. This is also caused by phlegm and qi, and &quot;Xingxiang San&quot; with equal parts of fragrant calamus and ginseng should be taken, along with &quot;Shou Xing Wan.&quot; If there is heat trapped in the heart, which manifests infrequently with agitation, heat in the nose and eyes, and difficulty in breathing—resembling Heart Wind, but recurring—one can take &quot;Shensu Decoction&quot; with an additional coin of fragrant calamus.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Essentials</strong><br><strong>by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Distinction Between Mania and Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Mania is characterized by delirious speech and erratic behavior, while epilepsy refers to a state of stiffness and unawareness, each having its own distinct symptoms. Currently, mania is linked to the spleen, while epilepsy is connected to the lungs. However, scriptures mention that those suffering from both mania and epilepsy may interchange between the two, and it is also noted that symptoms of epilepsy may manifest as mania. Thus, there are cases where both conditions coexist. </p>
<p>In conditions of mania accompanied by delirious speech and erratic movement, along with instances of stiffness and unawareness, patients may also hallucinate as if seeing ghosts or deities, with such episodes lasting half a day or more; this indicates coexisting mania and epilepsy. </p>
<p>Individuals with mania experience less sleep, which allows the defensive energy (Wei) to act independently. When the Yang force does not engage with the Yin, it leads to an excess of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, resulting in confusion of the spirit. When sleep is attained, the defensive energy can merge with the Yin, replenishing the deficiency, and thus harmonizing both Yin and Yang leads to recovery. </p>
<p>In cases of mania or epilepsy, where there is an aversion to sleep and a sense of self-sufficiency and wisdom, along with incessant chaotic behavior, a remedy may be to tranquilize the five internal organs, calming the heart and its energy by consuming one boiled white rooster, seasoned with five flavors, made into a porridge. </p>
<p>The scriptures state: &quot;Sorrow affects the inner vitality, causing harm to the soul; if the soul is harmed, one becomes delusional and unfocused, which leads to disharmony.&quot; To address the mania stemming from sorrow, warm herbs should be administered to nourish the Yang of the soul; for example, the formulas of Rehmannia Decoction and Jingqi Pills serve this purpose.</p>
<p>Further, the scriptures say: &quot;Excessive joy can harm the corporeal soul; when the corporeal soul is harmed, mania ensues, causing a loss of understanding of oneself.&quot; Hence, when mania is caused by excessive joy, cool herbs should be used to nourish the Yin of the corporeal soul, such as cinnabar, turmeric, and white alum.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<p>The commentary on &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Excessive joy leads to epilepsy, while excessive anger leads to mania. Joy belongs to the heart, and anger belongs to the liver; both are manifestations of excess fire. However, joy disperses energy, and those who are unable to fulfill their ambitions often experience stagnation and frustration. Generally, those whose hearts are clouded by phlegm can be treated with Ye&#39;s Qingxin Pills, Gold Leaf Tranquil Heart Pills, or Cinnabar Calming Spirit Pills. For those suffering from heart wind epilepsy, one can use Niu Huang Qingxin Pills or Zhuifeng Qutan Pills, and for the weak, add a piece of purple river vehicle to make a paste. Anger injures the liver; for this, use Ning Shen Daotan Decoction, Xie Qing Pills, or Danggui Longhui Pills. For those startled, use Baodan Pills or Jingqi Pills. Danxi states: The fire of the five emotions, when stagnant, produces phlegm, leading to epilepsy or mania, which should be managed by practical means. For instance, if joy injures the heart, it can be resolved with anger or overcome with fear; if worry injures the lungs, it can be overcome with joy or resolved with anger.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p>When Yangming exhibits madness due to mixed symptoms of febrile disease, if there is excess heat in the stomach and large intestine, with dryness and fire accumulating within, and constipation occurs, use Liangge San with Da Huang to treat it. For madness occurring after overeating rich foods, simply use salt water to induce vomiting, and it will recover, or use a mild adjusting soup.

<p>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;Severe Yin leads to epilepsy, severe Yang leads to madness.&quot; Hejian treats epilepsy and madness as one, both pertaining to phlegm-fire. The notion of severe Yin is not accurate. However, there are cases of temporary madness, where one speaks nonsensically but does not become long-term epileptic; conversely, some may be confused and deluded, yet remain stable and not become mad for a long time.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>The one who is insane displays abnormalities. Generally, they can speak, but during the episode, they fall silent; if they normally do not speak, in this state, they may moan, and in severe cases, they may become rigid and stare blankly, their hearts often unhappy. This indicates a deficiency in yin and blood, with unrest in the heart fire. The main remedy is the Great Regulating Decoction. For those who faint intermittently, use the Nourishing Yin and Tranquilizing Spirit Decoction; for those with incoherent speech, use the Calming Will Pill; for those who grieve and moan, use fried silkworms, burnt paper, combined with two qian of wine, and regularly take castor bean decoction to eliminate the root cause.</p>
<p>The one who is manic is dangerously mad. In mild cases, they are arrogant and self-righteous, enjoying singing and dancing; in severe cases, they may strip off their clothing and run, leap over fences and roofs; in even more extreme cases, they may yell with disheveled hair, not fearing water or fire, and even delight in killing. This indicates an overabundance of heart fire, with excess yang energy, causing the spirit to be uncontained, and phlegm-fire to accumulate, hence the need for the Lesser Regulating Decoction, the Three Huang Pill, the Controlling Phlegm Elixir, and the Single Bitter Asparagus Pill. Mania primarily targets expelling phlegm and reducing fire, while insanity also addresses calming the spirit and nourishing the blood. If there is chronic damage to the heart over the years, it cannot be treated.</p>
<p>Those whose vision, hearing, speech, and movements are all deluded are said to be possessed by malevolent spirits. In severe cases, they might claim to have seen and heard things in their lifetime, including supernatural beings of various colors. This indicates an extreme deficiency of qi and blood, insufficient spirit brightness, or the entrapment of excessive phlegm-fire, leading to a confused spirit; it is not genuinely due to supernatural beings or malign spirits.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, for internal treatment of typhoid and plague, a yellow pill made with human ingredients should be prepared according to the prescriptions for qi, blood, and phlegm; or one may simply use human yellow on its own as well.

If a woman dreams at night of a ghost coming to engage with her, a settling essence pill should be prepared, adding red beans, and decocted with water for ingestion. </p>
<p>If a woman experiences excessive menstrual bleeding, with blood and qi disturbing the heart, or suffers from postpartum lochia rushing upward leading to disordered speech and mental confusion, this is due to blood deficiency and spirit depletion. It is advisable to use a calming essence balm, but one must avoid solely relying on heart-replenishing and spirit-consolidating medicines.

<p>Furthermore, if a man has stagnant blood, one should use Tao&#39;s angelica active blood decoction. If someone experiences acute symptoms resembling cholera, with vomiting and diarrhea, or behaves deliriously like a drunk person, one should know that the issue has arisen from the heart.

<p>Madness occurs when the heat and toxins enter the stomach and combine with the heart, leading to confusion of the mind, rapid speech and action, nonsensical discernment and laughter.

<p>In cases of cold damage lasting four to five days with body heat and agitation, and one cannot sweat leading to madness, both exterior and interior present with heat; the treatment is San Huang Shi Gao Tang or Shuang Jie San.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage lasting six to seven days with strong heat, chest fullness, constipation, and a strong, rapid pulse leading to madness, the remedy is Da Cheng Qi Tang plus Huang Lian.</p>

<p>There are those with excessive yin causing agitation, wanting to sit in the well like a madman; there are those affected by fire, alarmed and restless like a madman.

<p>Madness due to the stagnation of blood presents with a deep and solid pulse, frequent rinsing of the mouth without swallowing, showing no outward symptoms; yet blood is accumulated in the lower part of the body, and urination is smooth like madness.

<p>In the initial signs of taiyang, heat is trapped in the lower part of the body like madness, and if blood flows downward, recovery follows. If the exterior has not been resolved, use Guizhi Decoction or Tao’s Gui Ling Drink; if the exterior has cleared but with urgent distension in the lower abdomen, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction; if there is blood affecting the heart and spleen, use Danggui Huoxue Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is taiyin with a yellowish hue and cloudy urination like madness, use Wuling Powder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient and modern medical teachings, the distinction between madness and insanity is discussed.</p>
<p>The illness of madness is primarily driven by excessive heart fire, causing the spirit to lose its residence; this sums it up. Madness reaches its peak; fire has an upward nature, just as the classics state that when the Yang energy is excessively elevated, it leads to madness. The “Ling Shu” states: when the disease of madness begins, there is little sleep and lack of appetite, arising from a sense of superiority, self-knowledge, and self-worth. Thus, the mad are driven to pursue, speaking grandly and with great ambition. Previously, it was said that insane speech appears as though they have seen something; indeed, this arises from extreme heart fire where words may mix good and evil, showing no regard for closeness or distance; this is the chaos of the spirit, which is termed madness. It indicates that when the fire is exceedingly intense and Yang energy is too elevated, the patient also rides on this fiery ascent, hence they discard their garments and climb heights, transitioning from madness to insanity. This is a way the sages have named a phenomenon that shares similarities but also has differences within.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient medicine, treating epilepsy and insanity with the same formula is a great error. Insanity is primarily a disease of the heart and often arises from excess, while epilepsy involves multiple organ systems and tends to be of a deficiency nature. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that insanity, epilepsy, and seizures are labels for conditions where one does not understand their suffering; later practitioners misinterpreted this as a single condition. However, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; discusses insanity and epilepsy as distinct conditions. The phrase “not knowing one&#39;s suffering” refers to a lack of awareness of the exact nature of the ailment. </p>
<p>Treatment methodologies should be differentiated. </p>
<p>High elevation and shedding of clothing, which leads to excessive weight and distance, are linked to insanity; the treatment should focus on reducing and eliminating phlegm and excessive fire, utilizing methods like rolling phlegm pills. In contrast, those who become overly discerning, speak irrationally, and lose their mental acuity are experiencing mania; the treatment should stabilize the heart and calm the spirit, employing methods such as pills of cow bile and vermilion.</p>
<p>Regarding heart wind diseases, few texts provide detailed accounts and many confuse them with epilepsy, treating them indistinctly. Although &quot;heart wind&quot; appears to be a term from the secular realm, it truly reflects serious illness. The ancients noted that wind moves swiftly and with various changes; wind causing paralysis is unaffectionate. &#39;Heart wind&#39; does not refer to external wind invading the interior, but rather signifies an internal change that is erratic and unkind, akin to a demonic infestation of the heart. This condition typically arises from long-term emotional strife and differs significantly from epilepsy. Epilepsy and mania are primarily characterized by intense heat and abundant wind-phlegm, with an overflow affecting the heart, which is often a condition of excess.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the heart wind arises, it is caused by the seven emotions and five desires being persistently thwarted. The liver often schemes, the gallbladder is frequently indecisive, and feelings have no outlet. The heart’s function is thought, and if this becomes severe, the heart’s blood diminishes daily, the spleen&#39;s fluids do not circulate, and phlegm obstructs the heart&#39;s orifices, leading to the formation of heart wind, which is mostly of a vacuous nature. The treatment must counter the seven emotions, fulfill the five desires, nourish the blood, clear phlegm, and bring the spirit back to the residence, addressing both the root and branches; this condition can be cured.</p>
<p>However, if one confuses this with epilepsy and hastily treats it, that is to invite an accelerated demise. Oh! When heart wind first manifests, it often pertains to a vacuous condition. Why is this? Excessive thinking harms the spleen, leading to diminished essence, daily depletion of blood, and the spirit becomes dispersed, no longer residing in its abode, which suddenly results in heart wind. Thus, it is known that its beginnings are all related to vacuity— prescriptions like Gui Pi Decoction, Yang Xin Decoction, and Ding Zhi Pill can be applied. </p>
<p>As for prolonged illness, the heart’s intentions change, leading to ignorance of beauty and ugliness, thoughts and worries disappear, and dietary habits remain the same, while aggressive energies increase, solidifying the roots of the disease. For those who have unresolved phlegm stagnation, the Zihua Method can be used for treatment, adjusting according to the symptoms, and nothing will fail to cure.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

For the poor, it is easier.

<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; only mentions mania without addressing epilepsy, whereas the &quot;Lingshu&quot; includes names for epilepsy and seizures. Various texts refer to mania in different ways—some mention madness, some refer to epilepsy, and others speak of wind-associated epilepsy or shock-related epilepsy, with divisions within epilepsy itself, yet none provide a definitive conclusion. Those who solely mention mania trace back to the &quot;Suwen&quot;; discussions on epilepsy or madness originate from the &quot;Lingshu.&quot; Importantly, mania and epilepsy are fundamentally different; it is not merely a case of differing terminologies but of distinct conditions. Although the &quot;Lingshu&quot; classifies mania and madness under one category, their manifestations are twofold, and their treatment varies, thus they differ significantly from epilepsy. Xu Sibo stated: adults have mania while children have epilepsy. However, this distinction is not entirely accurate.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p>Madness can manifest as either wildness or foolishness, sometimes as singing or laughing, other times as sorrow or weeping, resembling drunkenness or daze.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Door of Madness</strong></p>
<p><strong>From &quot;The Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; by Zhang Jiebin (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The diseases of madness and epilepsy are fundamentally different. The onset of manic illness develops gradually through prolonged delusions; whereas, the onset of epilepsy occurs suddenly, with moments of rigidity and intermittent episodes. Individuals with mania are often conscious, quick to anger, and violent; whereas those with epilepsy frequently experience confusion, fatigue, and tranquility. From this perspective, the distinctions in aspects of yin and yang, as well as cold and heat, are evident. Thus, the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: &quot;The prevalence of yang indicates mania, while the prevalence of yin suggests epilepsy.&quot; This meaning is clear. Later generations of scholars have proposed that both mania and epilepsy are generally caused by heat, but this is not necessarily the case. The characteristics of qi and pulse also have their own basis, and one must carefully differentiate and treat them according to the principles of yin and yang.</p>
<p>Epilepsy is indeed the same as &quot;dian.&quot; In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the description of the dian ailment is very detailed, while the distinction of &quot;xian&quot; (epilepsy) is unclear, which can be observed from this. Later generations have used terms like &quot;epileptic fits,&quot; &quot;wind epilepsy,&quot; and &quot;wind dian,&quot; which refer to different meanings and only serve to cause confusion, not necessarily providing clarity. For instance, &quot;Bie Lu&quot; mentions five types of &quot;xian&quot;: horse epilepsy, bovine epilepsy, porcine epilepsy, ovine epilepsy, and chicken epilepsy, which correspond to what is now called sheep and pig epilepsy. This naming is merely due to phonetic similarity and lacks substantial ground. Therefore, epilepsy is singular, while various schools have added further distinctions outside the dian syndrome but also considered as &quot;xian,&quot; which truly appears forced and lacks sufficient evidence. Additionally, &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; mentions concepts of wind epilepsy, fright epilepsy, food-induced epilepsy, as well as yin and yang epilepsy, which all require discernment.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Generally, manic conditions are often caused by fire. This may stem from ambitions leading to loss of spirit, or from worries and repressed emotions, where one feels constrained with no outlet for anger. This results in the liver and gallbladder&#39;s energy becoming rebellious, with the combination of wood and fire creating a harmful influence, which indeed reflects Eastern practical evidence. When this harmful influence affects the heart, it results in the spirit not being anchored; when it affects the stomach, it leads to violent and aggressive behaviors. Therefore, those treating this should prioritize harmonizing fire, and depending on whether phlegm or qi is involved, they should examine the severity and treat both. If the issue is solely due to fire without swelling, obstruction, or heat accumulation, it is simply necessary to clear the fire. Treatments like &quot;Withdraw the Fuel Decoction,&quot; &quot;Huanglian Jiedu Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Sanbu Pill&quot; should be used. If water does not control fire and there is a slight deficiency in both heart and kidney, &quot;Zhusha Anshen Pill,&quot; or herbal preparations like &quot;Manjiao Decoction&quot; and &quot;Er Yin Decoction&quot; should be used. If the yangming fire is excessive, &quot;Baihu Decoction&quot; or &quot;Yuqian Powder&quot; is recommended. If both the heart and spleen are overheated, with unusual outbursts and slight blockage, &quot;Qingxin Decoction,&quot; &quot;Liangge Powder,&quot; &quot;Sanhuang Pill,&quot; or &quot;Danggui Longhui Pill&quot; should be used. If fire causes phlegm, &quot;Qingge Drink,&quot; &quot;Baolong Pill,&quot; or &quot;Shengtie Luo Drink&quot; should be used, with &quot;Gun Tan Pill&quot; for severe cases. If the three burners are affected by severe heat, &quot;Da Chengqi Decoction&quot; should be administered.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If phlegm and fluid obstruct the pathways and obstruct the flow of Qi, one must first use methods to induce vomiting and also clear dietary factors. This is essential for treating mania.</p>
<p>Epileptic conditions often arise from phlegm. Whenever there is a reversal of Qi or stagnation of phlegm, it can obstruct the meridians and block the heart&#39;s gateways, leading to symptoms such as sudden fainting, drooping of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyeballs, spasms of the hands and feet, rigidity of the waist and spine, and recovery only after a while. This sudden onset and resolution of symptoms is due to the erratic flow of Qi.</p>
<p>Thus, for treatment, one should examine the phlegm and the Qi, prioritizing the more severe condition. If there is an issue of fire, one should also assess the pulse and clinical manifestations and treat accordingly. For Qi stagnation, it is advisable to use methods such as Qi-releasing drinks, harmonizing drinks, or formulations like Niuhuang Wan, Suhe Wan, or Jicheng Runxia Wan. For excessive phlegm, it is suitable to use drinks that clear the diaphragm, Liugan Decoction, Erchen Decoction, or Chenpi Banxia Decoction, or formulations like Baolong Wan and Zhushayunxian Wan. For cases with both phlegm and fire, use drinks that clear the diaphragm, Zhushay Anshen Wan, or Danqi Runxia Wan. For severe cases of phlegm reversing and Qi stagnation, one must use methods to induce vomiting and then adjust treatment according to the symptoms afterward.</p>
<p>Epileptic symptoms without fire are more common. If there is no fire pathogen, one should not recklessly use cooling medicines, for fear of harming the spleen Qi and causing the emergence of other conditions.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Furthermore, if there are conditions of excessive yin and declining yang, or if there is a sudden loss of qi and blood with absolutely no phlegm, heat, or rebellious qi, then prescriptions such as the Four Gentlemen, Four Substances, Eight Treasures, or Ten Complete Great Supplements are essential. Additionally, ingredients like dried ginger, cinnamon, and aconite must be used; one should not claim that epilepsy is entirely due to true evil and thus prohibit tonics. If there is a significant loss of true yin and qi does not return to its roots, leading to intermittent symptoms that are hard to cure and accompanied by cloudiness, one must use Ziheche Pill to achieve effectiveness. For those with a mixture of deficiency and excess, with mild phlegm-heat complicating a long-standing illness, the Lingnao Anshen Pill is most appropriate; adjustments can be made based on symptoms.</p>
<p>In cases of dementia, where there is usually no phlegm but could be due to emotional distress, unsatisfied desires, overthinking, ambivalence, or fear leading to gradual onset of dementia—with disordered speech, inappropriate actions, excessive sweating, or a tendency to worry—the manifestations can be numerous and peculiar. The pulse will typically be either wiry or rapid, large or small, changing frequently. If the reverse qi is in the heart, or if the liver and gallbladder channels have unclear qi, but the person appears strong in body, with no decrease in appetite, and lacks signs of collapse, then it is advisable to use Mianjian (a herbal decoction) for treatment; this is the most stable and effective approach.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, this condition has both those that can be cured and those that cannot, depending on the strength of the stomach and vital energy. Recovery must await the right time; it cannot be rushed. In cases where great fear suddenly injures the heart and gallbladder, leading to confusion and loss of spirit, the primary treatment should focus on quickly restoring the vital energy. The Qifuding or the Great Tonic Decoction can be used for this.</p>
<p>For children, they do not typically show symptoms of mania, but they often suffer from epilepsy. Children&#39;s illnesses may arise from prenatal influences or from being frightened after birth. Children’s spirits are relatively weak; when frightened, the liver and gallbladder lose their essence and the spirit cannot maintain residence. If the residence is empty, the vital energy cannot govern, allowing phlegm and evil influences to disrupt it. Thus, in treating children’s fright and seizures, one must first assess the vital energy, then examine the nature of the illnesses, and treat them accordingly. All methods are documented in pediatric texts.</p>
<p>I opine that &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; discusses the conditions of childhood fright, shock, and epilepsy. Chen Wuze discusses the causes of epilepsy based on three factors, which, although precise, imply that external wind and cold lead to manifest symptoms, while internal injury from food leads to latent symptoms; neither necessarily disrupts the spirit to this extent. Epilepsy, as a disease, is characterized by sudden fainting, particularly concerning the heart and the liver and gallbladder. It is not something that can simply arise from wind, cold, or diet. Moreover, the concept of wind-related epilepsy primarily pertains to influences of the wood element and is not described as an external affliction. Even if there are external influences or dietary issues, they are also due to the combination of fright and fear causing illness. If one lists these three causes together, it does not necessarily follow that they are equivalent.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Stroke and Mania</strong></p>
<p>Heat stroke and mania arise from a true heat disease of the Yangming channel. However, there are cases that resemble mania yet are not genuinely so; this distinction between false and true must be carefully analyzed and not overlooked. In instances of true heat mania, it belongs to the Yangming channel. This is because the Yangming channel is characterized by abundant qi and blood. When the pathogenic heat enters the stomach and intestines, and the heat accumulates without resolution, mania ensues. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that the stomach is associated with earth, and thus it is startled by the sound of wood, as earth is antagonistic to wood. When the fire is harmful, excessive heat causes serious harm. Those suffering extreme illness may shed their clothes and flee, sing atop heights, or go several days without food; this is because the limbs are the foundation of all Yang, and when Yang is vigorous, the limbs are solid and capable of climbing heights. Shedding clothes and fleeing happens due to excessive heat affecting the body. Uttering nonsensical statements, cursing without concern for kin or distance while singing, indicates that excessive Yang has become pathological. It is also said that when yin cannot withstand yang, the pulse becomes thin and swift, leading to mania. Furthermore, when pathogens invade the Yang, mania results.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This condition arises from the invasion of Yangming heat that ascends to disrupt the heart and lungs, resulting in confusion of spirit and mind. This is called Yang madness. However, when a person with a cold illness exhibits madness, it indicates that the heat pathogen has reached an extreme, and without vigorously expelling this fiery pathogen, it cannot be resolved. Thus, if one observes signs of constipation or a firm, distended abdomen, with indications to attack, it is appropriate to use methods such as the Da Xian Chui Qi (Da Xiao Cheng Qi) as well as Liang Ge San or Liu Yi Shun Qi Decoction to purge. If there are no signs of distension or firmness, and it is solely due to gastric fire, then one should simply use Bai Hu Tang or Chou Xin Yin to drain the fire pathogen, and the illness will recover on its own.</p>
<p>If the madness is not due to actual heat, there can be varying degrees of symptoms. As Zhang Zhongjing states: &quot;In cases of Taiyang disease that has not resolved, if heat has settled in the bladder, the person may appear mad, but if the exterior has not yet been resolved, it is not advisable to attack; one must first resolve the exterior. If the exterior has been resolved and there is only urgency in the lower abdomen, then it is appropriate to attack, and one should use the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang.&quot; He also says: &quot;In Taiyang disease that lasts six or seven days with exterior symptoms still present, when the pulse is weak and profound, and there is no sensation of fullness in the chest—if the person appears mad, this indicates heat in the lower jiao, with the lower abdomen likely feeling distended and urination flowing freely; in such a case, one should drain the blood to enable recovery, as indicated by Di Dang Tang.&quot;<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to these two points, if the heat of the sun&#39;s evil does not dissipate and enters the organs through the channels, but does not lead to true madness, it is therefore described as “like madness.” This is because the heat attacks the blood aspect and accumulates in the lower regions, hence it should be cleared downward. </p>
<p>Recently, I have observed in cases of typhus that there are also symptoms resembling madness, which ancient scholars did not mention. This may derive from loss of ambition, affecting the heart; or from sorrow and worry, affecting the lungs; or from loss of essence, affecting the kidneys; or from exhaustion due to overthinking, affecting the liver and spleen. When the root condition has already damaged the interior, and the cold evil affects from the outside, then the illness inevitably arises with the evil influence. The symptoms appear as madness, which is also referred to as “false madness.” </p>
<p>However, the signs of false madness must not display a yellow or red complexion, nor exhibit violent temperament; internally, there should be no obstruction in the chest and abdomen, and the pulse should not be slippery or solid. Although there may be intermittent agitation, if restrained, it will cease. The mouth may often speak nonsensically, and the voice will be weak. There may be visions of emptiness or a state of anxiety and instability. If we examine the upper part, the mouth will not be scorched with thirst, and if we examine the lower part, there will be no constipation. All these indicate that the essence and qi are injured, and the spirit and mind are not anchored. This condition contrasts sharply with true madness caused by extreme yang, much like the difference between ice and fire.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At times, doctors cannot discern the condition, and upon seeing chaos, they mistakenly label it as Yang frenzy, leading to reckless purging which surely results in death. In treating this, one must differentiate between Yin and Yang. If there is deficiency combined with pathogenic factors, and the pathogen resides in the Yang aspect, then one should use remedies like the Middle-Replenishing and Qi-Increasing Decoction; if it is in the Yin aspect, remedies like the Yin-Replenishing and Qi-Increasing Decoction are appropriate. If there is deficiency without pathogens and it is in the Yang aspect, then one should use formulas such as the Four Gentlemen, Eight Treasures, or the Complete Great Replenishing Decoction; if in the Yin aspect, use formulas like the Four Substances, Six Flavors, Left Gui Decoction, or the One Yin Decoction. In cases of Yin deficiency with fire, one should add or modify the One Yin Decoction or the Two Yin Decoction; for Yang deficiency with cold, remedies such as the Regulating Middle Decoction, Resuming Yang Drink, Eight Flavor Decoction, or Right Gui Decoction should be employed. This is a general outline; however, there are different manifestations that cannot be fully communicated in words. Understanding the intention behind the words allows one to grasp what has not been said.</p>
<p>If there is slight heat in the body, or a yellowish-red face, or restlessness with a desire to sit or lie in muddy water, yet the pulse is weak and lacking strength, this resembles a Yin condition manifesting as Yang, termed Yin agitation. This occurs because Yang deficiency below prevents the Qi from returning to its source, causing it to float and disperse above, resulting in agitation like madness. Therefore, one must promptly warm and tonify below; when the life gate is warmed, the fire will return to its source, and the illness will naturally resolve. If a doctor does not recognize this and mistakenly uses cold treatments, death is inevitable.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong> [Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo]</p>
<p><strong>Method for Treating Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of epilepsy that have persisted for many years indicate phlegm trapped between the heart&#39;s orifices, unable to be released. Patients who enjoy eating charcoal likely have their heart&#39;s fire obscured by phlegm, unable to express itself. Charcoal, being a residue of fire, harmonizes with the heart&#39;s fire and flavors, making it taste sweet like honey to the patient. </p>
<p>The formula includes one ounce of ginseng, three qian each of southern star, ghost arrow, burdock root, and white peony, one qian each of aconite and cinnamon, and two qian each of pinellia, acorus, and cinnabar powder. First, boil the above herbs in two bowls of water and divide it into two doses, mixing half of the cinnabar into the medicine for the patient to take. If the patient refuses to take it, give them charcoal; after consuming it, they will be happy to eat it. If they ask for more charcoal, it is fine to provide them with it. The second dose should be prepared in the same way. If the patient does not respond as well as before, they should be made to drink it quickly. If they resist, it is permissible to strike them to provoke their anger; anger will stir the liver&#39;s wood fire, generating heat for the heart, thus helping to dispel phlegm. </p>
<p>Although patients with epilepsy often eat regularly, the qi of food within their intestines can nourish their life without dying; it is, however, the heart that remains unyielding.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the heart dies early, then even a healthy person consuming grains will also perish; how much more so for those with epilepsy? I have seen those who perish early cannot wait until today. As long as the heart remains alive, it is merely phlegm and evil that obstructs it. At that moment of epilepsy, the spleen and stomach still hold vitality. Therefore, I use ginseng to treat the heart, adding aconite, calamus, and cinnamon to warm the center and dispel the evil. I add bupleurum to soothe the liver and balance the wood element, along with nux vomica, ghost arrow, and pinellia to expel phlegm and eliminate the evil. I add cinnabar to stabilize the spirit and calm the soul, naturally reducing the evil qi and increasing the righteous qi.</p>
<p>There is another remarkable method for treating epilepsy. The formula includes five qians each of bupleurum and white mustard seed, three qians each of white peony, pinellia, processed nux vomica, poria, and calamus, and one qian each of aconite and ginseng. Boil with ten bowls of water until reduced to two bowls. Give the patient one bowl to drink first, which will certainly cause fatigue. Then immediately administer another bowl, which will induce deep sleep. If they sleep for one or two days, do not awaken them suddenly, as if they were dead; let them wake naturally. When they awaken and are confused, ask for food and drink. If they mention their previous condition, do not give them anything immediately. After half a day of fasting, give them rice porridge, adding five fen each of ginseng and aged tangerine peel to the soup, and cook the porridge to serve.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

After taking it, let them sleep again; listen for them to wake up on their own, and then they will never have another episode, which is a marvelous method.</p>
<p>In cases where a person suffers from an illness analogous to flower mania, a woman might suddenly have epilepsy, seeing a man and refusing to let go of him. This represents an intense longing for a man that cannot be fulfilled, suddenly manifesting as a disease, like a violent storm, losing all sense of shame; upon seeing a man, she behaves as if he were her lover. This is due to the liver&#39;s wood being withered and an inner fire raging strongly, and the pulse will definitely be tight at the cun position. The treatment should use a formula to soothe the liver, disperse stagnation, and expel evil. Use five qian each of bupleurum, angelica, ophiopogon, and white mustard seed; one liang of white peony; and three qian each of stir-fried gardenia, poria spirit, and scrophularia; with one qian each of licorice and calamus, boiled in water to be taken.</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Epileptic illness often arises from the weakness and coldness of the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are weak and cold, the food consumed does not transform into essential qi but instead becomes phlegm. This phlegm condenses between the chest and diaphragm, unable to flow to the heart, leading to the manifestation of epilepsy. If one only treats phlegm without nourishing qi, there will inevitably be cases of sudden death. </p>
<p>The recipe for the treatment is as follows: Take five qian each of ginseng and white mustard seed, one liang of white atractylodes, one qian each of cinnamon, dried ginger, and tangerine peel, five fen each of licorice and fragrant calamus, and three qian of pinellia; decoct these herbs in water to take. This formula uses ginseng and atractylodes specifically to nourish the spleen and stomach, dried ginger to dispel cold pathogens, white mustard seed and pinellia to eliminate stubborn phlegm, and licorice and fragrant calamus to guide the formula into the heart and open the orifices. Naturally, the righteous qi returns, and the phlegm disperses. </p>
<p>With one dose, the spirit stabilizes; with a second dose, the spirit flourishes. What epilepsy cannot be cured? As for the manifestation of flower-related epilepsy, it stems from a woman&#39;s obsession with someone, which is also due to the coldness of the spleen and stomach allowing the evil to invade. For this condition, add one liang of white peony root, two qian of bupleurum, and three qian of stir-fried gardenia to the original recipe, omitting the cinnamon; it is also very effective, often stopping the epilepsy with just one dose. The reason is that bupleurum, white peony, and stir-fried gardenia all enter the liver to balance the wood element, dispel fire and scatter stagnant qi, thus achieving this extraordinary effect.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>Stupor resembles madness, silent and uncommunicative; like hunger, it lingers but feels lost. The mind desires to act wildly yet cannot; the heart wishes to be frantic but is afraid. Sometimes one may sleep for days without waking, at other times sit for days without sleeping. Occasionally, they meticulously mend their own clothes, or deeply hide and cover someone else&#39;s belongings. When speaking with others, they are mute and seem to drift away; when alone, they whisper quietly and cry. They may express aversion to food and refuse to swallow, yet when not offered food, they consume charcoal as if it were delightful. Although these symptoms may be attributed to possession or evil influence, they are essentially caused by phlegm and qi obstructing the chest and abdomen. Thus, the treatment for stupor is no mystery; treating phlegm is the same as treating stupor.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, when phlegm is at its peak and dullness is profound, how can it be effectively treated with ordinary Erchen Decoction? Therefore, the method uses the Immortal Pill to expel dullness: one tael each of ginseng, white mustard seed, and dodder seed; two taels of white atractylodes; three taels of poria; five qian of pinellia; five fen of aconite; three qian each of white wood蘇 and cinnabar, ground into powder. First, decoct each herbal ingredient, then mix the cinnabar powder with half a bowl of the decoction. If he refuses to take it, administer it with charcoal, and he will gladly drink it. After giving him another half bowl, allow him to act as he wishes; he will certainly feel tired and want to sleep. </p>
<p>Take advantage of his deep sleep to burn all his clothing and bedding, leaving only the garments he is wearing, and cover him with a new blanket, being careful not to wake him. This sleep may last several days; when he wakes, he will surely look for his clothes and find nothing, search for his bedding and discover it is not familiar, leading him to cry out in distress. Then present him with the same medicine again; he will surely refuse to take it, and even refuse the charcoal. It may be effective to whip him to provoke his anger, using strong individuals to hold him down and force the previous medicine into him; he will undoubtedly become very angry, and afterward, he will fall asleep again.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At this time, one must prepare fresh clothing, bedding, and other items, awaiting his awakening in half a day. When he sees that the whole room is filled with relatives, his heart will suddenly clear as if he understands, and he will undoubtedly weep greatly. Others should gently persuade him, and he will surely speak of matters concerning spirits and deities. Relatives will then say that a certain person has treated him and has already dispelled all the spirits, so there is no need for further worry. Upon hearing this, he will feel joyful, and his illness will be completely cured. The key to this method lies in greatly nourishing the heart and spleen, using Fuling (Poria) as the primary agent, which helps to expel phlegm from the heart; the remaining phlegm-dissolving medicine, along with Aconite, guides it throughout the body, sending all phlegm into the bladder for digestion. Baiwei (White Clay) and Tusizi (Cuscuta) are both excellent soothing herbs, while Cinnabar stabilizes the soul and calms the spirit, thus having remarkable effects, which is why they are used and produce results.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment for Mania</strong></p>
<p>When phlegm accumulates in the stomach and cannot be expelled, it leads to maniacal speech as if seeing ghosts, intermittently appearing and disappearing, causing a blockage in the chest. One should boil five pounds of beef and two dou of water into a soup and drink it until one can no longer eat. With a goose feather, probe for vomiting, and one will surely expel a large amount, specifically until a lump of thick yellow phlegm is expelled before ceasing. If it does not come out, drink again, ensuring it is completely expelled before stopping, or the previous condition will suddenly worsen. Afterwards, gradually drink a decoction of dried tangerine peel, Poria, licorice, and white atractylodes to restore balance.</p>
<p>In cases of fever leading to mania, where one might climb high and sing, discard clothing and run, dive into water, shout and curse without regard for kin, such beings are far from life. Zhongjing saved them with a decoction of bamboo leaves and gypsum, which is quite wonderful. The fire of Yangming is the most intense; once it erupts, it cannot be saved without a large dose of White Tiger Decoction to halt its overwhelming spread. However, people often fear using too much, thus employing only a small amount, akin to using a cup of water to extinguish a burning pile of firewood. Therefore, gypsum must be used in a dose of three or four taels or even half a pound, prepared in one decoction, for the fire&#39;s intensity to begin to diminish, and mania can also be somewhat alleviated. Yet, gypsum has a strong nature; though it effectively cools the fire, it can still damage the stomach&#39;s qi, hence it must be used in conjunction with ginseng for optimal effect. </p>
<p>Currently, there is a formula that uses half the White Tiger Decoction while adding other medicinal ingredients, named the Stomach-Replenishing Decoction. It consists of three taels each of gypsum, Scrophularia, and Ophiopogon, three qian of Anemarrhena, five qian each of ginseng and Plantago, and one tael of Poria, all combined with water for decoction.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This formula uses gypsum and Anemarrhena as a remedy to drain stomach fire, ginseng to generate stomach qi, and Yuan Shen to eliminate excess heat. Ophiopogon nourishes the yin of the lungs, while Poria and Plantago help direct fire downward to the bladder, allowing it to exit through urination. Furthermore, when there is excessive fire, one’s mouth must be dry; with thirst comes increased water intake. I employ these two ingredients to disperse moisture, so that when water flows, the fire dissipates alongside it. This formula drains fire without harming qi, appearing superior to Bai Hu Tang. One dose calms the delirium, two doses reduce thirst by half, and three doses stop the thirst completely, also extinguishing the fire, thus four doses are unnecessary. </p>
<p>For those experiencing fire heat leading to delirium, or sweating profusely like rain, with dry mouth and tongue, or sensations like thorn pricks, this formula will yield immediate effects, ensuring it does not lead to death. &quot;Living treatment&quot; refers to situations where a person is on the brink of death, but not yet dead, and medication is used to restore them. For instance, cases of manic or comatose illness are often due to heat illness, characterized by singing high, running while discarding clothing, jumping into water, and incessantly shouting violent words, with protruding tongue and relentless thirst, producing bright phlegm and a face resembling an inflamed state. </p>
<p>The formula uses half a pound of gypsum, one pound of Yuan Shen, three taels of white mustard and pinellia each, one tael of Anemarrhena, ginseng, and licorice, along with five taels of Ophiopogon and several hundred pieces of bamboo leaves. First, half a sheng of glutinous rice is boiled to create a broth, with the rice grains removed. Half a pot of this broth is then used to brew the previously mentioned herbs, with several bowls taken to provide in response to requests for water. Offer it continuously and, once finished, sleep will follow. Promptly use another pound of Yuan Shen and half a pound of Ophiopogon for brewing while waiting.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When someone awakens and calls for water, give them this soup, and they will surely drink it with joy. After finishing it, they will likely fall into a deep sleep again, and then prepare more soup with the residue for when they wake. When they wake again, if they do not want to drink as before, do not force them; let it happen naturally. Later, use three taels of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, six taels of codonopsis, one tael of cornus, decocted into two bowls to give them. One dose will surely cure them, and there is no need to repeat it. This is one method of treatment.</p>
<p>As for those who have a fit of madness but stop to curse at others, not thirsty, and refuse to drink the offered water, this is madness caused by cold. It arises from stagnation of Qi and repressed anger; such individuals typically display weakness and lack of spirit, and the madness manifests abruptly. The treatment should focus on expelling phlegm while also supplementing Qi. The prescription includes one tael each of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atractylodes, one qian each of pinellia, nux vomica, and aconite, and three fen of calamus, all decocted and taken. The brilliance of this formula lies in supplementing Qi while not excessively expelling phlegm. Cold-induced madness is treated similarly to epilepsy, and aconite is included to eliminate cold Qi, while calamus directs the remedy to the heart channel, letting it naturally soothe the throat for sound sleep, as if lost to the disease. Adding one qian of bupleurum helps to relieve the stagnation of the liver wood Qi, further enhancing effectiveness.</p>
<p>Some individuals may have persistent madness that does not improve; they might attack others with a knife, curse officials loudly, fail to recognize family, or have children unaware of them, showing joy at the sight of water but anger at food. This reflects a deficiency of heart Qi and an invasion by heat evil, along with phlegm Qi encumbering them.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>These ailments desire to dispel fire, yet fire resides within the heart, making it impossible to disperse; they want to eliminate phlegm, yet phlegm is also in the heart, making it difficult to dissolve. Only by strengthening the energy of the spleen and stomach can the heart receive nourishment on its own. There’s no need to eliminate phlegm; it will naturally transform, and there’s no need to dispel fire; it will naturally cease. This method is named &quot;Transforming Madness Elixir,&quot; using one tael each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and poria, one fen (a unit), and three qian each of pinellia and cuscus, one qian each of calamus and licorice, boiled in water for consumption. One dose will calm the madness, and the second will heal the illness. This method is excellent for nourishing the heart, spleen, and stomach while transforming phlegm without dispelling fire. For if fire is dispelled, the heart&#39;s energy becomes more injured, and phlegm accumulates further; how can madness be stopped? Notably, the use of one fen of aconite is brilliant, facilitating the nourishing of the heart and the dissolving of phlegm directly into the heart, allowing energy to be easily replenished and phlegm to be easily dissolved.</p>
<p>When a person is ill and becomes mad, as if seeing ghosts, it is due to the deficiency of righteous energy and the invasion of邪 (evil). It seems appropriate to rectify the邪. However, since邪 gathers where energy is weak, if we do not treat the deficiency, how can we talk of the rest? Thus, it is urgent to support the righteous energy and lightly assist with medications to eliminate phlegm and邪. For those who see ghosts in madness, it is a deficiency. Therefore, use one tael each of ginseng and white atractylodes, three qian each of pinellia and tian nanxing, and one qian of aconite, and administer a large dose; the madness will calm itself.</p>
<p>For those who are mad, do not recognize people, and do not see ghosts, this signifies heat. They should not be given the previous decoction. Seeing ghosts indicates deficiency and not true heat, so the method includes ginseng, added to medications for eliminating phlegm and邪, as it is a reversal for treatment.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

As the classics say, when the symptoms are mild, go against it; when severe, follow it—this is the principle.</p>
<p>By taking a significant quantity, with a mild and slow pace, use gourd stem powder, adding Fangfeng powder and Liulian powder to induce vomiting; the illness will quickly settle.

<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: when illness affects the various yang channels, accompanied by both cold and heat, in the various divisions, also presenting cold and heat, it is named mania. Needle the empty channels, observe the divisions; when excessive heat is evident, the illness will stop. If the illness initially occurs and is untreated once a year or monthly, with four to five episodes a month, it is called epilepsy. Needle into the various divisions and channels; of those without cold, adjust with needles, and the illness will cease. [The term &quot;illness has stopped&quot; originally read &quot;the illness has stopped,&quot; revised according to the &quot;Su Wen, on Long Needling.&quot;] Those with liver-fire conditions will have yellow urine at first, abdominal pain requiring rest, body heat, delusions, and agitation, fullness and pain in the flanks, restlessness in hands and feet, and inability to lie still. Excess of metal (Geng and Xin) leads to great sweating. If the qi is counterflowing, it leads to severe conditions. Needle the foot&#39;s jueyin and shaoyang. If counterflowing, headaches result, with a pulse surging toward the head.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: the branch of the foot yangming, named &quot;Fenglong,&quot; is located eight inches above the ankle and branches to the taiyin; its branch follows the outer edge of the tibia, links to the head and neck, and connects with the energies of the various channels, descending to interweave with the throat. When the illness manifests as qi counterflowing, it results in throat obstruction leading to sudden muteness; when excessive, it leads to mania and frenzy; when deficient, it causes the feet to be unresponsive and the shins to wither, found at the location of the branch.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

<p>A manic person often eats a lot, sees spirits and gods, and laughs without openly expressing it; they find great joy. To treat this, use the feet in the Taiyin, Sun, and Yangming channels, and later use the hands in the Taiyin, Sun, and Yangming.</p>

For treating insanity, first grasp the hand around the wrist, then press the pulse of the middle finger that connects to the heart, pinching it with the fingernail.

Sun arrived and requested a bowl of warm wine, mixing a dose of medicine for him. After a while, he asked for more wine, giving him half a bowl. The monk then slept for two days and nights before awakening, returning to normalcy. The brother-in-law thanked Sun and inquired about his method. Sun said: &quot;Many can calm the spirit, but few can make it dim enough to sleep. This is the &#39;Red Cinnabar, Sour Jujube Seed, and Frankincense Powder&#39; from the spiritual garden, which people cannot rely on to aid sleep.&quot; Likewise, Wu Gong, in his youth, suffered from a heart condition; after taking a dose from this prescription, he awoke five days later and was cured.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text from &quot;The Rites of Confucianism to Serve Parents&quot; states: A old man, aged sixty, suffered from the burdens of labor and became violently mad, with his mouth and nose feeling as if insects were crawling. He would scratch with both hands, and this persisted for several years. A physician diagnosed that both his wrists had strong pulses like thick ropes. The diagnosis was: the mouth is the &quot;flying gate,&quot; and the stomach is the &quot;entrance gate.&quot; The mouth is the upper source of the stomach. The nose is where the Foot Yangming meridian begins, connecting at the middle of the nose, alongside the Taiyang, descending along the nasal pillar, crossing the philtrum, encircling the lips, and joining the承浆. Thus, his ailment manifests in this way. The burdens of labor contribute to a fiery condition; fire rides on the Yangming meridian, resulting in madness. Hence, it is said in classical texts that when diseases of Yangming arise, one climbs high to sing, discards clothing, and insults without regard to family ties. Furthermore, the liver governs planning and the gallbladder governs decision-making. When labor is pressing and financial resources cannot sustain, the liver repeatedly plans but the gallbladder cannot decide, leading to a blockage without release. The heart fire becomes overwhelming, thus taking over the Yangming meridian. The stomach belongs to earth while the liver belongs to wood, and the gallbladder corresponds to the fire of mutual relations; this fire follows the energy of wood and enters the stomach, resulting in violent madness. He was commanded to be placed in a warm room, to sweat profusely, and this was repeated three times. The Inner Canon states: &quot;When wood is stagnant, it should be unblocked; when fire is stagnant, it should be unleashed.&quot; Indeed, this is the case. He was given half a pound of the Tiaogai Chengqi Decoction, boiled with five liters of water until half-done, divided into three doses, resulting in a major downward purge of twenty measures, with a mixture of blood and stagnant blood excreted, and upon retrieval, he was well. Subsequently, he was treated with Tongsheng Powder.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

To regulate the stomach and administer a great purging decoction, one should purge dozens of bowel movements; after three to five days, the fluid surges back up by one or two liters, and after another three to five days, it is purged again. After five to sixty days, purge more than a hundred times, and vomit seven or eight times.

I said, &quot;This is not a spiritual issue but a sickness.&quot; I suggested treating her with remedies to tonify the spleen, clear heat, and resolve phlegm, assuring that she would recover in a few days. However, her family did not believe me and summoned several shamans to spray water and cast spells on her. After about ten days, she died. When asked why a condition that was not spiritual led to death when treated as such, I explained that during the hot month, the external environment was steamy and oppressive, while the internal environment was filled with stagnant heat, exacerbating her condition.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

Now, if startled by the measuring rod of the law, it startles the spirit and the blood becomes unsettled; if sprayed with the water of the law, it solidifies the body and tightens the skin, preventing sweat from draining away.

Furthermore, talismanic water only addresses heat and phlegm in the diaphragm; a sip of cool water relieves stomach heat, surely it brings comfort? It can also be used for tranquility. However, if there is internal injury and deficiency, akin to enduring severe cold in winter, swallowing talismanic water will assuredly freeze the stomach and cause harm. When there is heat trapped internally, and evil heat on the surface, it is necessary to relieve it through sweat; if one does not attain clarity and coolness, with the skin pores tightly sealed, how can the heat be resolved? This will surely lead to an internal attack, causing the yin and yang to scatter and the vital blood and qi to clash—death is imminent.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Treasure of Hygiene&quot; states: In the year of Jia Yin, in the fourth month, I traveled to the boundary river and stayed there. A patient from Chou Siew Wen had been ill for five to seven days, raving wildly, tearing off his clothes and running away, calling out without regard for kin or stranger, and offering milk to others. People at the time said that the wind demon had come. The shaman prayed for him, but it only worsened his condition. The emperor heard of this and ordered me to treat him. I found six distinct pulses, and for several days, he could not defecate and was very thirsty, craving milk. I considered that in the northern regions, due to high cold and dense pores, there are few who suffer from cold-induced illness. However, the weather was fluctuating, causing exposure to cold evils and failure to relieve the condition, leading to a Yangming syndrome with fullness in the stomach, delirium, and, additionally, eating mutton to bolster the heat, which resulted in the two heats combining. This is called severe Yang madness, where Yang predominates and relief is urgent. Thus, I administered a large dose of the Da Cheng Qi Decoction with 1.5 liang of Huanglian, boiled in water for him to take. That night, he had several bowel movements, expelling over twenty pieces of dry stool, and he sweated and began to recover. The next day, I visited him again; he was cool to the touch and had a steady pulse. Everyone was delighted, exclaiming that Dr. Luo Qianfu had effectively treated the wind demon. From this, one can see that treating cold damage is not comparable to treating mixed diseases; the six channels differ, and each transmission varies. When diagnosing and uncertain, one does not know the source of the illness and instead insults and defames each other. Alas! The greed for fame and excessive attachment to reputation are shameful in the pursuit of knowledge. When will this illness ever be cured?<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

He was given a dose of Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Astragalus, Angelica, Peony, and cooked Aconite. After administration, the fever intensified, leading to more delirium and rampant behavior. Some suggested that Aconite was incorrectly used. Upon checking the pulse, it remained the same, so the Aconite was increased, and a large dose was administered. This resulted in sweating, the fever subsided, and the pulse normalized. </p>
<p>The King of Heaven treated a patient with a yellow complexion all over, wild speech, chest pain, and an avoidance of touch.

<p>The governor of Zhumountain&#39;s brother went mad due to abundant blood; he was treated successfully with Didao Decoction. </p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; mentions that Hua Boren treated a monk who was delirious and hallucinating, seeing people as ghosts. His pulse was excessive and slippery, and he was panting. It was determined that he had a full condition of the Yangming stomach. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: &quot;Yangming governs inside, with an abundance of both blood and qi, leading to extreme states like discarding clothes, climbing higher, and shouting wildly.&quot; Therefore, he took Sanhua Decoction three to four times, followed by a fire-clearing formula, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>A person during lunch suddenly grabbed a handful of hot coals from the stove and furiously swallowed them, while also muttering and shouting at others. Those nearby helped and checked his pulse, which was string-like and moving straight up and down, while the pulse at the left wrist was particularly floating and slippery, indicating wind-phlegm obstructing the heart orifices. The method was to bring forth the phlegm and concentrate the spirit.

This is acquired while in the mother’s womb, when the mother experiences a sudden shock, causing the energy to rise rather than descend, and thus the vital essence remains entangled, resulting in the child developing madness.

Qibo replied: The limbs are the root of all Yang; when Yang is abundant, the limbs are robust, and when robust, one is capable of climbing high. The Emperor asked: What causes one to abandon clothing and run? Qibo replied: It is due to excessive heat in the body, which compels one to shed clothes and desire to run. The Emperor asked: What about those who speak wildly and insult, not avoiding relations of kinship or distance, and sing? Qibo replied: When Yang is abundant, it causes one to speak wildly and insult without regard for kinship, and to have no desire for food, which leads to wild running. This is because the stomach channel connects to the heart; when Yang is abundant, the spirit becomes confused, hence causing such wild speech and insults, disregarding kinship.

The disease of dizziness arises from unstable heart qi, with accumulation in the chest, hence it is caused by high winds and heated faces. When phlegm and heat interact, it stirs up wind; when wind and heart are in disarray, it causes confusion—hence the term wind dizziness. In adults, it is termed madness, while in children, it is classified as epilepsy, yet fundamentally, they are one and the same. This prescription for treatment is guaranteed to cure; however, fears may arise from misdiagnosis or misalignment. Generally, avoid eating flesh from the twelve classifications; pig meat causes issues, leading to excessive gas and urgency, which can lead to inevitable death.

All diseases caused by hundreds of evils originate from various paths, exhibiting numerous forms. These conditions may manifest as signs of chaotic disturbances, with some individuals remaining silent, while others speak incessantly or babble, singing or crying, chanting or laughing, sleeping in ditches, consuming filth, or exposing themselves. Some may wander about day and night, rage without restraint, or exhibit signs of insect-like spirits, appearing frantic and agitated. For such types of madness, acupuncture and moxibustion, along with herbal remedies, should be the main treatments. Those who are under the influence of wind should also conclude that it is the wind that causes the madness. When wind enters the Yang channels, it causes craziness; when it enters the Yin channels, it causes epilepsy."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"The harmful effects of wind on those who have been suffering for a long time can lead to joint pain and result in madness; this must not be overlooked.

For those who are traveling and cannot afford immediate treatment, it is advisable to take various herbal decoctions, which are better than no treatment at all, but it is also beneficial to apply moxibustion at painful areas with three-seven moxa. In cases of madness, there is a desire to escape or a tendency to claim oneself as a sage or divine being, which requires moxibustion for effective treatment and the possibility of a lasting cure. However, if there is sorrowful crying or moaning, this is caused by a pathogen rather than madness, and one should treat it according to the specific affliction. When pathogens invade the yang, it leads to madness; when they invade the yin, it results in stasis of blood. A pathogen entering the yang manifests as insanity, while one entering the yin results in silence and pain.

Excess refers to deviating from rituals and laws, resulting in a loss of propriety. When the outside is clear but the inside is turbid, with movements being chaotic, it resembles the nature of fire; conversely, when calm and clear, adhering to standards and maintaining balance, it reflects the nature of water. Thus, the kidney (water) governs will, and since water and fire are opposites, an abundance of heart fire leads to a diminishment of kidney water, resulting in a loss of will and madness. Some say that the excessive Yang corresponds to madness, while excessive Yin corresponds to mania; this differs from what is stated in the \"Suwen.\" The commentaries say: excessive joy leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Joy relates to the will of the heart, therefore, when the heart is intensely warm, there is much joy resulting in mania; anger relates to the will of the liver, as the fire of the liver suppresses metal and cannot maintain balance with wood, thus a strong liver results in much anger and madness.

The heat energy is fierce, and the medicinal energy is similar. When the two meet, there is a risk of internal injury to the spleen.

Water and fire are opposites, and the foolish resemble fire. Fire is brilliant externally but chaotic and murky internally, consuming all things, bringing heat and bitterness, and in its own way creates disturbance and disorder, ascending violently to damage all things, clouding clarity and leading to darkness. Water emerges from metal and moistens what is dry; fire arises from wood and harms its source. Therefore, the Book of Changes states: “Nothing moistens all things like water.” It also refers to fire as weaponry.

Common people’s anger and insults are similar. Some may express joy without anger, thinking of it as playful taunting; this too is the use of inner fire. Thus, those who curse in anger also harbor joy in cursing others; anger accompanied by negativity can indicate an inner desire to express anger towards others. In cases of cold damage leading to mania and running about, cursing without regard for kin or strangers indicates an excess of yang and deficiency of yin. The formula known as \"Daungui Chengqi Decoction,\" which combines \"Chengqi Decoction\" with angelica, ginger, and jujube, is used to promote continuous movement.

The \"Maijing\" states: Yin attached to Yang leads to madness, while Yang attached to Yin leads to delirium. The \"Disease Origins\" states: Yang pathogens accompanying Yang result in madness, while Yin pathogens accompanying Yin lead to delirium.

Zheng sound is weak in battle, disconnected, and the characters are produced from the throat, thus it is called Zheng sound. ### Madness and Mania Madness is associated with yin, while mania is associated with yang. Madness often brings joy, whereas mania frequently elicits anger. A weak pulse can be treated; if it is strong, it is fatal. Generally, this condition stems from phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest, so treatment should calm the mind and remove the phlegm. There are also those who develop this illness due to possession by evil spirits, in which case, treat it with methods to dispel the evil. The discussion in the \"Treatise on Original Diseases\" is particularly precise, affirming what the world calls heavy yin corresponds to madness, and heavy yang corresponds to mania. Generally, these are symptoms of heat. In madness, the spirit is not at rest, words spoken seem to draw from visions, lasting for years without cure, damaging the heart, which is a true ailment. If the heart is filled with heat, it should be purified; if phlegm obscures the mind, it is necessary to expel the phlegm and calm the spirit. If there is weeping and groaning due to possession, this is not mania, but rather a treatment involving burning mulberry paper and administering small amounts of wine. Wind-induced madness brings pain to the chest, causing ringing in the ears, for which Tianmeng Dong can be used to soothe the heart, ground into powder and taken with wine in small doses. Madness is to be treated in spring, alleviating itself by summer, and medicines that support heart qi should be used.

Thus, joy pertains to the heart, while anger pertains to the liver, indicating an excess of fire from these two organs. The Yin-Yang theory of the \"Nanjing\" may not be entirely accurate. Generally, madness is characterized by an abundance of phlegm-fire, whereas mania is attributed to insufficient heart blood, often seen in individuals with lofty aspirations that are unachieved.

Is this possible?\" It was replied, \"The Classic of Difficulties states: 'Excess yang leads to madness, excess yin leads to mania.' It also mentions that those with mania are often joyful, while those with madness are often filled with anger. The so-called excess yang means the three full Yin-Yang pulses are vigorous and strong, hence the illness appears robust and powerful, leading to the term 'madness.' Excess yin means the three full Yin-Yang pulses are suppressed and thin; thus, the illness manifests as fatigue and lack of strength, leading to the term 'mania.' I once saw a young man from Dongyang who was mad. One day, during a strong wind, he suddenly flew to the top of a tower in the east of the city, singing and crying. The tower had no steps to climb, and everyone viewed it as a wonder. I think of the dragon, a pure yang creature that lies hidden in the sea; its body only has scales and armor, and it lacks wings. On days when the yang energy rises, it borrows the force of the wind and clouds to soar. This is the meaning here. Why should it be deemed strange? Regarding pulse diagnosis: A pulse that is large, hard, and rapid indicates mania; a sinking, rapid pulse suggests phlegm-heat. A large, slippery pulse indicates self-reliance; a sinking, small, rapid pulse is a sign of death; a weak, taut, rapid pulse is also fatal. When the cun pulse is large and slippery, if it sinks it indicates a solid condition, and if it is slippery it indicates qi.

However, scriptures mention that those suffering from both mania and epilepsy may interchange between the two, and it is also noted that symptoms of epilepsy may manifest as mania. Thus, there are cases where both conditions coexist. In conditions of mania accompanied by delirious speech and erratic movement, along with instances of stiffness and unawareness, patients may also hallucinate as if seeing ghosts or deities, with such episodes lasting half a day or more; this indicates coexisting mania and epilepsy. Individuals with mania experience less sleep, which allows the defensive energy (Wei) to act independently. When the Yang force does not engage with the Yin, it leads to an excess of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, resulting in confusion of the spirit. When sleep is attained, the defensive energy can merge with the Yin, replenishing the deficiency, and thus harmonizing both Yin and Yang leads to recovery. In cases of mania or epilepsy, where there is an aversion to sleep and a sense of self-sufficiency and wisdom, along with incessant chaotic behavior, a remedy may be to tranquilize the five internal organs, calming the heart and its energy by consuming one boiled white rooster, seasoned with five flavors, made into a porridge. The scriptures state: \"Sorrow affects the inner vitality, causing harm to the soul; if the soul is harmed, one becomes delusional and unfocused, which leads to disharmony.\" To address the mania stemming from sorrow, warm herbs should be administered to nourish the Yang of the soul; for example, the formulas of Rehmannia Decoction and Jingqi Pills serve this purpose. Further, the scriptures say: \"Excessive joy can harm the corporeal soul; when the corporeal soul is harmed, mania ensues, causing a loss of understanding of oneself.\" Hence, when mania is caused by excessive joy, cool herbs should be used to nourish the Yin of the corporeal soul, such as cinnabar, turmeric, and white alum."},{"anchor":"trans-30p","marker":"30p","type":"translation","text":"**Introduction to Medicine** 【Ming Dynasty, Li Chan】 **Epilepsy is characterized by unpredictable emotions.** The commentary on \"Suwen\" states: Excessive joy leads to epilepsy, while excessive anger leads to mania.

The illness of madness is primarily driven by excessive heart fire, causing the spirit to lose its residence; this sums it up. Madness reaches its peak; fire has an upward nature, just as the classics state that when the Yang energy is excessively elevated, it leads to madness. The “Ling Shu” states: when the disease of madness begins, there is little sleep and lack of appetite, arising from a sense of superiority, self-knowledge, and self-worth. Thus, the mad are driven to pursue, speaking grandly and with great ambition. Previously, it was said that insane speech appears as though they have seen something; indeed, this arises from extreme heart fire where words may mix good and evil, showing no regard for closeness or distance; this is the chaos of the spirit, which is termed madness. It indicates that when the fire is exceedingly intense and Yang energy is too elevated, the patient also rides on this fiery ascent, hence they discard their garments and climb heights, transitioning from madness to insanity. This is a way the sages have named a phenomenon that shares similarities but also has differences within."},{"anchor":"trans-37p","marker":"37p","type":"translation","text":"In ancient medicine, treating epilepsy and insanity with the same formula is a great error. Insanity is primarily a disease of the heart and often arises from excess, while epilepsy involves multiple organ systems and tends to be of a deficiency nature. The \"Lingshu\" states that insanity, epilepsy, and seizures are labels for conditions where one does not understand their suffering; later practitioners misinterpreted this as a single condition. However, the \"Lingshu\" discusses insanity and epilepsy as distinct conditions. The phrase “not knowing one's suffering” refers to a lack of awareness of the exact nature of the ailment. Treatment methodologies should be differentiated. High elevation and shedding of clothing, which leads to excessive weight and distance, are linked to insanity; the treatment should focus on reducing and eliminating phlegm and excessive fire, utilizing methods like rolling phlegm pills. In contrast, those who become overly discerning, speak irrationally, and lose their mental acuity are experiencing mania; the treatment should stabilize the heart and calm the spirit, employing methods such as pills of cow bile and vermilion. Regarding heart wind diseases, few texts provide detailed accounts and many confuse them with epilepsy, treating them indistinctly. Although \"heart wind\" appears to be a term from the secular realm, it truly reflects serious illness. The ancients noted that wind moves swiftly and with various changes; wind causing paralysis is unaffectionate. 'Heart wind' does not refer to external wind invading the interior, but rather signifies an internal change that is erratic and unkind, akin to a demonic infestation of the heart. This condition typically arises from long-term emotional strife and differs significantly from epilepsy.

The treatment must counter the seven emotions, fulfill the five desires, nourish the blood, clear phlegm, and bring the spirit back to the residence, addressing both the root and branches; this condition can be cured. However, if one confuses this with epilepsy and hastily treats it, that is to invite an accelerated demise. Oh! When heart wind first manifests, it often pertains to a vacuous condition. Why is this? Excessive thinking harms the spleen, leading to diminished essence, daily depletion of blood, and the spirit becomes dispersed, no longer residing in its abode, which suddenly results in heart wind. Thus, it is known that its beginnings are all related to vacuity— prescriptions like Gui Pi Decoction, Yang Xin Decoction, and Ding Zhi Pill can be applied. As for prolonged illness, the heart’s intentions change, leading to ignorance of beauty and ugliness, thoughts and worries disappear, and dietary habits remain the same, while aggressive energies increase, solidifying the roots of the disease.

They have a simple and sparse diet, and their constitution is generally robust; even if they fall ill, their righteous energy remains abundant while pathogenic energy is light, making it easier to treat. **General Discussion** The \"Suwen\" only mentions mania without addressing epilepsy, whereas the \"Lingshu\" includes names for epilepsy and seizures. Various texts refer to mania in different ways—some mention madness, some refer to epilepsy, and others speak of wind-associated epilepsy or shock-related epilepsy, with divisions within epilepsy itself, yet none provide a definitive conclusion. Those who solely mention mania trace back to the \"Suwen\"; discussions on epilepsy or madness originate from the \"Lingshu.\" Importantly, mania and epilepsy are fundamentally different; it is not merely a case of differing terminologies but of distinct conditions. Although the \"Lingshu\" classifies mania and madness under one category, their manifestations are twofold, and their treatment varies, thus they differ significantly from epilepsy.

Their speech lacks coherence, and they are oblivious to cleanliness or filth. This state lasts for many years without recovery, commonly referred to as \"heart wind,\" which often occurs in those whose aspirations are high but whose desires are unmet. During a fit of madness, the patient is often frenzied and violent, similar to how one with a fever might behave, shouting and cursing indiscriminately, regardless of kinship. In severe cases, they may climb to heights and sing, discard their clothes and run, leap over walls and rooftops, acting beyond their physical strength or speaking of things they have never witnessed—this indicates an evil influence attaching to them. When epilepsy strikes, individuals may become disoriented, unable to recognize people, dizzy, and may collapse, completely unconscious of their surroundings.

The onset of manic illness develops gradually through prolonged delusions; whereas, the onset of epilepsy occurs suddenly, with moments of rigidity and intermittent episodes. Individuals with mania are often conscious, quick to anger, and violent; whereas those with epilepsy frequently experience confusion, fatigue, and tranquility. From this perspective, the distinctions in aspects of yin and yang, as well as cold and heat, are evident. Thus, the \"Nan Jing\" states: \"The prevalence of yang indicates mania, while the prevalence of yin suggests epilepsy.\" This meaning is clear. Later generations of scholars have proposed that both mania and epilepsy are generally caused by heat, but this is not necessarily the case. The characteristics of qi and pulse also have their own basis, and one must carefully differentiate and treat them according to the principles of yin and yang. Epilepsy is indeed the same as \"dian.\" In the \"Inner Canon,\" the description of the dian ailment is very detailed, while the distinction of \"xian\" (epilepsy) is unclear, which can be observed from this. Later generations have used terms like \"epileptic fits,\" \"wind epilepsy,\" and \"wind dian,\" which refer to different meanings and only serve to cause confusion, not necessarily providing clarity. For instance, \"Bie Lu\" mentions five types of \"xian\": horse epilepsy, bovine epilepsy, porcine epilepsy, ovine epilepsy, and chicken epilepsy, which correspond to what is now called sheep and pig epilepsy. This naming is merely due to phonetic similarity and lacks substantial ground. Therefore, epilepsy is singular, while various schools have added further distinctions outside the dian syndrome but also considered as \"xian,\" which truly appears forced and lacks sufficient evidence.

This may stem from ambitions leading to loss of spirit, or from worries and repressed emotions, where one feels constrained with no outlet for anger. This results in the liver and gallbladder's energy becoming rebellious, with the combination of wood and fire creating a harmful influence, which indeed reflects Eastern practical evidence. When this harmful influence affects the heart, it results in the spirit not being anchored; when it affects the stomach, it leads to violent and aggressive behaviors. Therefore, those treating this should prioritize harmonizing fire, and depending on whether phlegm or qi is involved, they should examine the severity and treat both. If the issue is solely due to fire without swelling, obstruction, or heat accumulation, it is simply necessary to clear the fire. Treatments like \"Withdraw the Fuel Decoction,\" \"Huanglian Jiedu Decoction,\" or \"Sanbu Pill\" should be used. If water does not control fire and there is a slight deficiency in both heart and kidney, \"Zhusha Anshen Pill,\" or herbal preparations like \"Manjiao Decoction\" and \"Er Yin Decoction\" should be used. If the yangming fire is excessive, \"Baihu Decoction\" or \"Yuqian Powder\" is recommended. If both the heart and spleen are overheated, with unusual outbursts and slight blockage, \"Qingxin Decoction,\" \"Liangge Powder,\" \"Sanhuang Pill,\" or \"Danggui Longhui Pill\" should be used.

This sudden onset and resolution of symptoms is due to the erratic flow of Qi. Thus, for treatment, one should examine the phlegm and the Qi, prioritizing the more severe condition. If there is an issue of fire, one should also assess the pulse and clinical manifestations and treat accordingly. For Qi stagnation, it is advisable to use methods such as Qi-releasing drinks, harmonizing drinks, or formulations like Niuhuang Wan, Suhe Wan, or Jicheng Runxia Wan. For excessive phlegm, it is suitable to use drinks that clear the diaphragm, Liugan Decoction, Erchen Decoction, or Chenpi Banxia Decoction, or formulations like Baolong Wan and Zhushayunxian Wan.

If there is a significant loss of true yin and qi does not return to its roots, leading to intermittent symptoms that are hard to cure and accompanied by cloudiness, one must use Ziheche Pill to achieve effectiveness. For those with a mixture of deficiency and excess, with mild phlegm-heat complicating a long-standing illness, the Lingnao Anshen Pill is most appropriate; adjustments can be made based on symptoms. In cases of dementia, where there is usually no phlegm but could be due to emotional distress, unsatisfied desires, overthinking, ambivalence, or fear leading to gradual onset of dementia—with disordered speech, inappropriate actions, excessive sweating, or a tendency to worry—the manifestations can be numerous and peculiar. The pulse will typically be either wiry or rapid, large or small, changing frequently. If the reverse qi is in the heart, or if the liver and gallbladder channels have unclear qi, but the person appears strong in body, with no decrease in appetite, and lacks signs of collapse, then it is advisable to use Mianjian (a herbal decoction) for treatment; this is the most stable and effective approach."},{"anchor":"trans-45p","marker":"45p","type":"translation","text":"However, this condition has both those that can be cured and those that cannot, depending on the strength of the stomach and vital energy.

The Qifuding or the Great Tonic Decoction can be used for this. For children, they do not typically show symptoms of mania, but they often suffer from epilepsy. Children's illnesses may arise from prenatal influences or from being frightened after birth. Children’s spirits are relatively weak; when frightened, the liver and gallbladder lose their essence and the spirit cannot maintain residence. If the residence is empty, the vital energy cannot govern, allowing phlegm and evil influences to disrupt it. Thus, in treating children’s fright and seizures, one must first assess the vital energy, then examine the nature of the illnesses, and treat them accordingly. All methods are documented in pediatric texts. I opine that \"Qianjin Fang\" discusses the conditions of childhood fright, shock, and epilepsy. Chen Wuze discusses the causes of epilepsy based on three factors, which, although precise, imply that external wind and cold lead to manifest symptoms, while internal injury from food leads to latent symptoms; neither necessarily disrupts the spirit to this extent. Epilepsy, as a disease, is characterized by sudden fainting, particularly concerning the heart and the liver and gallbladder. It is not something that can simply arise from wind, cold, or diet. Moreover, the concept of wind-related epilepsy primarily pertains to influences of the wood element and is not described as an external affliction.

When the pathogenic heat enters the stomach and intestines, and the heat accumulates without resolution, mania ensues. The \"Inner Canon\" states that the stomach is associated with earth, and thus it is startled by the sound of wood, as earth is antagonistic to wood. When the fire is harmful, excessive heat causes serious harm. Those suffering extreme illness may shed their clothes and flee, sing atop heights, or go several days without food; this is because the limbs are the foundation of all Yang, and when Yang is vigorous, the limbs are solid and capable of climbing heights. Shedding clothes and fleeing happens due to excessive heat affecting the body. Uttering nonsensical statements, cursing without concern for kin or distance while singing, indicates that excessive Yang has become pathological.

Thus, if one observes signs of constipation or a firm, distended abdomen, with indications to attack, it is appropriate to use methods such as the Da Xian Chui Qi (Da Xiao Cheng Qi) as well as Liang Ge San or Liu Yi Shun Qi Decoction to purge. If there are no signs of distension or firmness, and it is solely due to gastric fire, then one should simply use Bai Hu Tang or Chou Xin Yin to drain the fire pathogen, and the illness will recover on its own.

As Zhang Zhongjing states: \"In cases of Taiyang disease that has not resolved, if heat has settled in the bladder, the person may appear mad, but if the exterior has not yet been resolved, it is not advisable to attack; one must first resolve the exterior. If the exterior has been resolved and there is only urgency in the lower abdomen, then it is appropriate to attack, and one should use the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang.\" He also says: \"In Taiyang disease that lasts six or seven days with exterior symptoms still present, when the pulse is weak and profound, and there is no sensation of fullness in the chest—if the person appears mad, this indicates heat in the lower jiao, with the lower abdomen likely feeling distended and urination flowing freely; in such a case, one should drain the blood to enable recovery, as indicated by Di Dang Tang.\""},{"anchor":"trans-48p","marker":"48p","type":"translation","text":"According to these two points, if the heat of the sun's evil does not dissipate and enters the organs through the channels, but does not lead to true madness, it is therefore described as “like madness.” This is because the heat attacks the blood aspect and accumulates in the lower regions, hence it should be cleared downward. Recently, I have observed in cases of typhus that there are also symptoms resembling madness, which ancient scholars did not mention. This may derive from loss of ambition, affecting the heart; or from sorrow and worry, affecting the lungs; or from loss of essence, affecting the kidneys; or from exhaustion due to overthinking, affecting the liver and spleen. When the root condition has already damaged the interior, and the cold evil affects from the outside, then the illness inevitably arises with the evil influence. The symptoms appear as madness, which is also referred to as “false madness.” However, the signs of false madness must not display a yellow or red complexion, nor exhibit violent temperament; internally, there should be no obstruction in the chest and abdomen, and the pulse should not be slippery or solid. Although there may be intermittent agitation, if restrained, it will cease. The mouth may often speak nonsensically, and the voice will be weak. There may be visions of emptiness or a state of anxiety and instability. If we examine the upper part, the mouth will not be scorched with thirst, and if we examine the lower part, there will be no constipation.

This is one method of treating this condition."},{"anchor":"trans-58p","marker":"58p","type":"translation","text":"**Treatment for Mania** When phlegm accumulates in the stomach and cannot be expelled, it leads to maniacal speech as if seeing ghosts, intermittently appearing and disappearing, causing a blockage in the chest. One should boil five pounds of beef and two dou of water into a soup and drink it until one can no longer eat. With a goose feather, probe for vomiting, and one will surely expel a large amount, specifically until a lump of thick yellow phlegm is expelled before ceasing. If it does not come out, drink again, ensuring it is completely expelled before stopping, or the previous condition will suddenly worsen. Afterwards, gradually drink a decoction of dried tangerine peel, Poria, licorice, and white atractylodes to restore balance. In cases of fever leading to mania, where one might climb high and sing, discard clothing and run, dive into water, shout and curse without regard for kin, such beings are far from life. Zhongjing saved them with a decoction of bamboo leaves and gypsum, which is quite wonderful. The fire of Yangming is the most intense; once it erupts, it cannot be saved without a large dose of White Tiger Decoction to halt its overwhelming spread. However, people often fear using too much, thus employing only a small amount, akin to using a cup of water to extinguish a burning pile of firewood. Therefore, gypsum must be used in a dose of three or four taels or even half a pound, prepared in one decoction, for the fire's intensity to begin to diminish, and mania can also be somewhat alleviated. Yet, gypsum has a strong nature; though it effectively cools the fire, it can still damage the stomach's qi, hence it must be used in conjunction with ginseng for optimal effect. Currently, there is a formula that uses half the White Tiger Decoction while adding other medicinal ingredients, named the Stomach-Replenishing Decoction. It consists of three taels each of gypsum, Scrophularia, and Ophiopogon, three qian of Anemarrhena, five qian each of ginseng and Plantago, and one tael of Poria, all combined with water for decoction."},{"anchor":"trans-59p","marker":"59p","type":"translation","text":"This formula uses gypsum and Anemarrhena as a remedy to drain stomach fire, ginseng to generate stomach qi, and Yuan Shen to eliminate excess heat. Ophiopogon nourishes the yin of the lungs, while Poria and Plantago help direct fire downward to the bladder, allowing it to exit through urination. Furthermore, when there is excessive fire, one’s mouth must be dry; with thirst comes increased water intake. I employ these two ingredients to disperse moisture, so that when water flows, the fire dissipates alongside it. This formula drains fire without harming qi, appearing superior to Bai Hu Tang. One dose calms the delirium, two doses reduce thirst by half, and three doses stop the thirst completely, also extinguishing the fire, thus four doses are unnecessary. For those experiencing fire heat leading to delirium, or sweating profusely like rain, with dry mouth and tongue, or sensations like thorn pricks, this formula will yield immediate effects, ensuring it does not lead to death. \"Living treatment\" refers to situations where a person is on the brink of death, but not yet dead, and medication is used to restore them. For instance, cases of manic or comatose illness are often due to heat illness, characterized by singing high, running while discarding clothing, jumping into water, and incessantly shouting violent words, with protruding tongue and relentless thirst, producing bright phlegm and a face resembling an inflamed state. The formula uses half a pound of gypsum, one pound of Yuan Shen, three taels of white mustard and pinellia each, one tael of Anemarrhena, ginseng, and licorice, along with five taels of Ophiopogon and several hundred pieces of bamboo leaves. First, half a sheng of glutinous rice is boiled to create a broth, with the rice grains removed. Half a pot of this broth is then used to brew the previously mentioned herbs, with several bowls taken to provide in response to requests for water. Offer it continuously and, once finished, sleep will follow. Promptly use another pound of Yuan Shen and half a pound of Ophiopogon for brewing while waiting."},{"anchor":"trans-60p","marker":"60p","type":"translation","text":"When someone awakens and calls for water, give them this soup, and they will surely drink it with joy. After finishing it, they will likely fall into a deep sleep again, and then prepare more soup with the residue for when they wake. When they wake again, if they do not want to drink as before, do not force them; let it happen naturally. Later, use three taels of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, six taels of codonopsis, one tael of cornus, decocted into two bowls to give them. One dose will surely cure them, and there is no need to repeat it. This is one method of treatment. As for those who have a fit of madness but stop to curse at others, not thirsty, and refuse to drink the offered water, this is madness caused by cold. It arises from stagnation of Qi and repressed anger; such individuals typically display weakness and lack of spirit, and the madness manifests abruptly. The treatment should focus on expelling phlegm while also supplementing Qi. The prescription includes one tael each of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atractylodes, one qian each of pinellia, nux vomica, and aconite, and three fen of calamus, all decocted and taken. The brilliance of this formula lies in supplementing Qi while not excessively expelling phlegm. Cold-induced madness is treated similarly to epilepsy, and aconite is included to eliminate cold Qi, while calamus directs the remedy to the heart channel, letting it naturally soothe the throat for sound sleep, as if lost to the disease. Adding one qian of bupleurum helps to relieve the stagnation of the liver wood Qi, further enhancing effectiveness. Some individuals may have persistent madness that does not improve; they might attack others with a knife, curse officials loudly, fail to recognize family, or have children unaware of them, showing joy at the sight of water but anger at food. This reflects a deficiency of heart Qi and an invasion by heat evil, along with phlegm Qi encumbering them."},{"anchor":"trans-61p","marker":"61p","type":"translation","text":"These ailments desire to dispel fire, yet fire resides within the heart, making it impossible to disperse; they want to eliminate phlegm, yet phlegm is also in the heart, making it difficult to dissolve. Only by strengthening the energy of the spleen and stomach can the heart receive nourishment on its own. There’s no need to eliminate phlegm; it will naturally transform, and there’s no need to dispel fire; it will naturally cease. This method is named \"Transforming Madness Elixir,\" using one tael each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and poria, one fen (a unit), and three qian each of pinellia and cuscus, one qian each of calamus and licorice, boiled in water for consumption. One dose will calm the madness, and the second will heal the illness. This method is excellent for nourishing the heart, spleen, and stomach while transforming phlegm without dispelling fire. For if fire is dispelled, the heart's energy becomes more injured, and phlegm accumulates further; how can madness be stopped? Notably, the use of one fen of aconite is brilliant, facilitating the nourishing of the heart and the dissolving of phlegm directly into the heart, allowing energy to be easily replenished and phlegm to be easily dissolved. When a person is ill and becomes mad, as if seeing ghosts, it is due to the deficiency of righteous energy and the invasion of邪 (evil). It seems appropriate to rectify the邪. However, since邪 gathers where energy is weak, if we do not treat the deficiency, how can we talk of the rest? Thus, it is urgent to support the righteous energy and lightly assist with medications to eliminate phlegm and邪. For those who see ghosts in madness, it is a deficiency. Therefore, use one tael each of ginseng and white atractylodes, three qian each of pinellia and tian nanxing, and one qian of aconite, and administer a large dose; the madness will calm itself. For those who are mad, do not recognize people, and do not see ghosts, this signifies heat. They should not be given the previous decoction. Seeing ghosts indicates deficiency and not true heat, so the method includes ginseng, added to medications for eliminating phlegm and邪, as it is a reversal for treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-62p","marker":"62p","type":"translation","text":"**Prescription** **Xiongshen Wine** (from \"Thousand Gold Prescriptions\") Treats wind-induced insanity affecting the five organs and six bowels, and is effective for various邪病.

His strength increased, making it impossible for three or five people to restrain him. They burned talismans and performed rituals, asking shamans for guidance, but remained ignorant of the true situation. They tried various substances like cinnabar, ox gall, rhinoceros horn, pearls, amber, and musk, wasting their wealth as their room became desolate. They traveled nearly two hundred miles to find the same man. He buried the madman under the wheel of a cart, about two zhang high, securing it in the center with wheel components. A hole was made in the rim, shaped like a basin, and the madman was tied to it, lying down on a soft mat. Another person was instructed to sit below a machine and stir it with a stick, turning it thousands of times, making the patient vomit a couple of dou of green and yellow froth around the wheel. The madman said: \"I can't endure this; let me be released.\" He was set free as requested. They asked for cold water and gave him ice water to drink by several sheng, and only then did his madness subside."},{"anchor":"trans-116p","marker":"116p","type":"translation","text":"When a madman cannot withstand his yang, then his pulses become weak and he experiences a fainting spell; when yang is combined, he becomes mad. The \"Nan Jing\" states: excessive yang leads to madness, while excessive yin leads to insanity. Yang corresponds to the organs, and yin corresponds to the viscera. It is not that yang is hot and yin is cold; when heat combines in yang, it causes madness, and madness leads to cold; when combined in yin, it leads to insanity, and insanity results in death. The \"Nei Jing\" states: when the foot yangming is full, it leads to madness; thus, one climbs high and sings, discards clothing and runs, and does anything without restraint—this is the extreme of heat. To regulate the stomach and administer a great purging decoction, one should purge dozens of bowel movements; after three to five days, the fluid surges back up by one or two liters, and after another three to five days, it is purged again. After five to sixty days, purge more than a hundred times, and vomit seven or eight times. When vomiting occurs, keep a warm chamber with a fire, to assist the heat and reduce sweating, and after several sweats, balance will be restored."},{"anchor":"trans-117p","marker":"117p","type":"translation","text":"The text from \"Danxi Heart Method\" states: One year, after a day of drunken feasting, a disciple spoke irrationally, claiming to be possessed by the spirit of his deceased elder brother, recounting events from the brother's life with great detail. His uncle reprimanded him, saying it was not a spiritual issue, but rather the result of overindulgence in greasy food and alcohol, causing phlegm. After administering a large bowl of salt water, he expelled one or two liters of phlegm, sweated heavily, and slept soundly for a night, restoring his peace. A woman from the Jin family, in her youth, attended a banquet during the hot month. When her aunt questioned her disordered seating, she felt embarrassed and ashamed, leading to the onset of her condition, during which her speech became incoherent. Among her ramblings, she repeatedly stated that \"I am not a servant,\" with a rapid and taut pulse. I said, \"This is not a spiritual issue but a sickness.\" I suggested treating her with remedies to tonify the spleen, clear heat, and resolve phlegm, assuring that she would recover in a few days. However, her family did not believe me and summoned several shamans to spray water and cast spells on her. After about ten days, she died. When asked why a condition that was not spiritual led to death when treated as such, I explained that during the hot month, the external environment was steamy and oppressive, while the internal environment was filled with stagnant heat, exacerbating her condition."},{"anchor":"trans-118p","marker":"118p","type":"translation","text":"Moreover, the old phlegm accumulated, combined with shame and gloom, what can be said of the phlegm and heat! Now, if startled by the measuring rod of the law, it startles the spirit and the blood becomes unsettled; if sprayed with the water of the law, it solidifies the body and tightens the skin, preventing sweat from draining away. If sweat does not drain, then the internal heat steams and burns, and if the blood is not settled, then the yin withers and the yang cannot stand alone—how can one survive this? Some say that the \"Secret Essentials of the External Chamber\" contains forbidden incantations; should they be abandoned? I say: transforming essence into qi is merely a minor skill, suitable for treating small ailments. However, if there is internal deficiency and external excess, one must use the grand and righteous methods, which have established patterns that are clearly verifiable. Furthermore, talismanic water only addresses heat and phlegm in the diaphragm; a sip of cool water relieves stomach heat, surely it brings comfort? It can also be used for tranquility. However, if there is internal injury and deficiency, akin to enduring severe cold in winter, swallowing talismanic water will assuredly freeze the stomach and cause harm. When there is heat trapped internally, and evil heat on the surface, it is necessary to relieve it through sweat; if one does not attain clarity and coolness, with the skin pores tightly sealed, how can the heat be resolved? This will surely lead to an internal attack, causing the yin and yang to scatter and the vital blood and qi to clash—death is imminent."},{"anchor":"trans-119p","marker":"119p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Treasure of Hygiene\" states: In the year of Jia Yin, in the fourth month, I traveled to the boundary river and stayed there. A patient from Chou Siew Wen had been ill for five to seven days, raving wildly, tearing off his clothes and running away, calling out without regard for kin or stranger, and offering milk to others. People at the time said that the wind demon had come. The shaman prayed for him, but it only worsened his condition. The emperor heard of this and ordered me to treat him. I found six distinct pulses, and for several days, he could not defecate and was very thirsty, craving milk. I considered that in the northern regions, due to high cold and dense pores, there are few who suffer from cold-induced illness. However, the weather was fluctuating, causing exposure to cold evils and failure to relieve the condition, leading to a Yangming syndrome with fullness in the stomach, delirium, and, additionally, eating mutton to bolster the heat, which resulted in the two heats combining. This is called severe Yang madness, where Yang predominates and relief is urgent. Thus, I administered a large dose of the Da Cheng Qi Decoction with 1.5 liang of Huanglian, boiled in water for him to take. That night, he had several bowel movements, expelling over twenty pieces of dry stool, and he sweated and began to recover. The next day, I visited him again; he was cool to the touch and had a steady pulse. Everyone was delighted, exclaiming that Dr. Luo Qianfu had effectively treated the wind demon. From this, one can see that treating cold damage is not comparable to treating mixed diseases; the six channels differ, and each transmission varies. When diagnosing and uncertain, one does not know the source of the illness and instead insults and defames each other. Alas! The greed for fame and excessive attachment to reputation are shameful in the pursuit of knowledge. When will this illness ever be cured?"},{"anchor":"trans-120p","marker":"120p","type":"translation","text":"\"The Essentials of Medicine\" states: A woman from Zhejiang was continuously insane. The doctor ground half a tael of gourd seeds into powder, administered each dose weighing a qian, mixed with well water to fill a cup and gave it to her. She subsequently experienced a great vomiting. After vomiting, she fell into a deep sleep; she was not to be disturbed, and from then on, she remained well. A patient named Xu suffered from Yang rejection, displaying madness and rage, cursing indiscriminately, whether towards kin or strangers, sometimes crying or singing. The six pulses were weak upon inspection, her body felt like ice, and she would yell loudly if disturbed. Jie Gu stated: If we deprive her of food, it would suffice, thus we did not give her any to eat. I used the Major Order the Qi Decoction to purge her, resulting in several sheng of filthy matter expelled from her internal organs, and her madness moderately settled. After a few days, it recurred, and I purged her again. This was done five or seven times, leading to the expulsion of several dou of feces, and she was cured; her body became warm, and her pulse was restored, achieving complete recovery. This is the method of remedying through food deprivation."},{"anchor":"trans-121p","marker":"121p","type":"translation","text":"In the year of Wushen, a man committed a crime and was stripped of his clothes; he was about to be punished when he was released. His spirit suddenly lost its clarity, as if he were mad. I gave him a pill for shock and fear, which he took and then fell asleep. Upon waking, his illness was gone. Zhang Zaiyang, a deputy, had a wife who lost her mind due to fear of bandits; this had lasted for several years. I prescribed a pill for shock and fear, and she was cured before completing the dose. Huang Yanqi’s wife had been mad and convulsing for over ten years, with no remedy providing results. I prescribed a pill for shock and fear, removing the aconite and adding iron powder. She too was cured before finishing the dose. The \"Ancient and Modern Medical Guide\" states that a girl of fifteen, upset by anger, suffered from reversed speech, wanted to bite and hit people, secretly hid things, laughed and cried intermittently, felt fearful and timid, and could not distinguish hunger from satiety, experienced heat in her body. I treated her with Fangfeng Tongsheng San, adding raw Rehmannia and peony root; after two doses, she calmed down. The \"Ten Thousand Diseases Returning to Spring\" recounts a woman who went mad, discarded her clothes, jumped over walls and rooftops, did not recognize friends or family, spoke wildly, and could not be restrained by others. The doctors were at a loss, and I instructed her family to pour cold water on her chaotically. She was doused numerous times and soon fell down. Upon examining her pulse, all six positions were strong and taut, indicating extreme heat producing wind. I administered Fangfeng Tongsheng San, adding raw Rehmannia, yellow lumbricus, peach kernel, safflower, and peony root; she calmed down after three doses.

His pulse was thin and slow. He was given a dose of Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Astragalus, Angelica, Peony, and cooked Aconite. After administration, the fever intensified, leading to more delirium and rampant behavior. Some suggested that Aconite was incorrectly used. Upon checking the pulse, it remained the same, so the Aconite was increased, and a large dose was administered. This resulted in sweating, the fever subsided, and the pulse normalized. The King of Heaven treated a patient with a yellow complexion all over, wild speech, chest pain, and an avoidance of touch. The accumulation of blood in the middle jiao was the problem; he was given a dose of Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction, which expelled the stagnant blood and restored health. The governor of Zhumountain's brother went mad due to abundant blood; he was treated successfully with Didao Decoction. The \"Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment\" mentions that Hua Boren treated a monk who was delirious and hallucinating, seeing people as ghosts. His pulse was excessive and slippery, and he was panting. It was determined that he had a full condition of the Yangming stomach. The \"Suwen\" states: \"Yangming governs inside, with an abundance of both blood and qi, leading to extreme states like discarding clothes, climbing higher, and shouting wildly.\" Therefore, he took Sanhua Decoction three to four times, followed by a fire-clearing formula, which resulted in recovery. A person during lunch suddenly grabbed a handful of hot coals from the stove and furiously swallowed them, while also muttering and shouting at others. Those nearby helped and checked his pulse, which was string-like and moving straight up and down, while the pulse at the left wrist was particularly floating and slippery, indicating wind-phlegm obstructing the heart orifices. The method was to bring forth the phlegm and concentrate the spirit.
