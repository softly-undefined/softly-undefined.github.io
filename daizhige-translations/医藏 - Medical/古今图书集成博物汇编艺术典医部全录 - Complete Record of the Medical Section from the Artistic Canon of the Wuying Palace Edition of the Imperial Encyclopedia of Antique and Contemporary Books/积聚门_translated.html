      <div><p><strong>Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Complete Compilation of the Medical Section, Volume 316</strong></p>
<p><strong>Path of Accumulation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of the Yellow Emperor is large and vacuous, with accumulated qi in the abdomen, and a constricting disease named &quot;jue xian&quot; occurs, similarly affecting women. It leads to illness in the limbs, with sweating occurring in the presence of wind. </p>
<p><em>[Note: The abdomen is the enclosure of the spleen and earth. When sweating occurs in the limbs due to wind, it indicates that wind-dampness has invaded the spleen, causing accumulated qi. This is because the evil of wind-wood internally dries the earth of the spleen, and the dampness interacts with the yin earth, thus retaining and accumulating. If the spleen qi cannot irrigate the surroundings, it reverses internally and leads to constricting qi.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Qi Jue</strong></p>
<p>When heat from the small intestine moves to the large intestine, it causes the condition of &quot;ji&quot; and results in heaviness.<br><em>[Note: &quot;Ji&quot; refers to a gathering that forms by accumulating fluids, as the small intestine governs liquids and the large intestine governs fluids. When heat from the small intestine transfers to the large intestine, it leads to the retention of fluids, resulting in &quot;fu ji&quot;.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: There is fullness in the lower abdomen, with roots present on all sides—what illness is this? Is it treatable? Qi Bo replied: This illness is called &quot;fu liang.&quot; The Emperor asked: How does one acquire &quot;fu liang&quot;? Qi Bo said: It is due to the presence of large amounts of pus and blood outside the intestines and stomach, making it untreatable. If one attempts to treat it, cutting and pressing can lead to death. The Emperor questioned: Why is this so? Qi Bo explained: If it descends, it will cause yin to manifest, leading to the downward flow of pus and blood; if it ascends, it will press upon the stomach and cause internal masses. This indicates a prolonged illness, making it difficult to treat. If it is above the navel, it is a reversal; if below the navel, it follows. One should not act hastily to expel it, as this relates to needling practices.<br><em>[Note: The roots present on all sides indicate that this illness resides in the blood, with channels connecting above and below. It is untreatable by massage; pressing for dissolution will surely cause pain and potentially death. This relates to a tangible pathology that is not easily resolved. &quot;Below&quot; refers to the lower abdomen; &quot;yin&quot; refers to the anterior and posterior yin. Thus, due to the presence of yin, downward flow of pus and blood is inevitable.]</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If one follows the channels upwards, it affects the stomach cavity and the area around the stomach, leading to the accumulation of pus and blood outside the intestines and stomach, resembling a large bag. Above the navel is the air division of the abdomen, hence it is opposite; below the navel is the blood division of the womb, which is easier to flow and thus aligned. One must not move this; it must not be massaged or disturbed, but should be welcomed and taken away immediately.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: If a person’s body and thighs are swollen, and there is pain around the navel, what illness is this? Qi Bo replied: This condition is called &quot;suppressed beam,&quot; which is the root of wind. Its energy overflows from the large intestine and settles in the lower abdomen. The original point of the lower abdomen is below the navel, hence the pain around the navel. It should not be moved; moving it would cause a condition of dampness related to water.</p>
<p>(Note: The movement of qi between the skin and muscle causes swelling in the body and limbs. This wind pathogen injures the qi and stays around the navel and abdomen; hence it is called the root of wind. The wind&#39;s energy overflows outside the large intestine and remains in the lower abdomen, exactly below the navel, causing pain around it. It should not be recklessly attacked to provoke the water; if the water overflows upwards, it will negatively affect urination.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The Emperor said: “I suffer from fullness and reversed qi in my lower abdomen; it has persisted for two or three years. What is the cause of this illness?” Qi Bo replied: “The illness is called &#39;si ji&#39; (breath accumulation). It does not obstruct eating, and it should not be treated with moxibustion or needling. The accumulation can be addressed with guiding and medication, but the medicine alone cannot cure it.” </p>
<p>(Note: The lungs govern qi and control breathing, hence lung accumulation is referred to as &#39;si ji&#39;. It gradually builds up over time, which is why it has lasted two or three years. This illness has a tangible presence in the abdomen and cannot be treated with needling. One should use the methods of guiding and harmonizing medications; both approaches should be undertaken together for the illness to be cured. If only the medicine is used without guiding, it cannot be treated effectively.)</p>
<hr>
<p>When the kidney pulse is slightly rapid, the liver pulse is slightly rapid, and the heart pulse is slightly rapid, but there is no swelling, all indicate &#39;jia&#39; (a type of stagnation). </p>
<p>(Note: &#39;Slightly rapid&#39; refers to a cold and deficient pulse. The viscera qi is retained; hence the pulse presents this way.) When the three yang pulses are rapid, it indicates stagnation. </p>
<p>(Note: Illness in the qi of the three yang leads to stagnation.)</p>
<hr>
<p>In relation to the four seasons: If the jueyin channel is congested, it causes ailments of fullness in the lower abdomen; if the shaoyin channel is congested, it leads to blood accumulation in the urine; if the taiyin channel is congested, it results in fullness in the heart and abdomen; if the yangming channel is congested, it presents as accumulation along with frequent fright; if the taiyang channel is congested, it manifests as accumulation with frequent headaches; if the shaoyang channel is congested, it results in accumulation with frequent tightness in the muscles and eye pain. </p>
<p>(Note: Congestion refers to more blood and less qi, with slight cold present. Blood conditions are termed accumulations, due to excess blood that becomes stagnant and forms a mass.) </p>
<hr>
<p>(From the Ling Shu - The Classic of the Spirit Pivot)</p>
<hr>
<p>(Section on the manifestations of evil qi affecting the organs and their shapes)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The heart pulse is slightly slow, indicative of a retention beneath the heart, moving up and down, sometimes spitting blood. [Note: The retention beneath the heart is due to excess, hence the slightness. If evil energy is thin beneath the heart, and the heart governs blood, heat will overflow, hence the occasional spitting of blood.]</p>
<p>The spleen pulse is slightly large, presenting as great pus and blood in the abdomen, outside of the intestines and stomach. [Note: “Large” indicates excess. The great pus and blood in the abdomen signify excess accumulation.]</p>
<p>The liver pulse is slightly rapid, representing phlegm or fat, located beneath the ribs. If covered like a cup, it is slightly slow, representing water dysphoria. [Note: The liver is suffering from rapidity, hence the slightly rapid pulse indicates fat or phlegm. If beneath the ribs resembles being covered, it indicates excess energy. Water dysphoria is also due to accumulation from food and drink.]</p>
<p>The lung pulse is slippery and strong, indicating respiration and upward qi. [Note: Slippery indicates abundant yang energy, hence the indication of respiratory upward qi.]</p>
<p>Huang Di asked: How can one recognize the accumulation of disorders in the intestines? Shao Yu replied: The skin is thin and lacks moisture, the flesh is soft and not firm; in this way, the intestines and stomach become ill. When ill, evil energies linger and accumulate, damaging the connection between the spleen and stomach. If cold and warmth are not taken in turns, and evil energy slightly arrives, accumulations from grains and livestock will remain, leading to a major accumulation. [Note: Fluids, blood, and qi are generated by the intestines and stomach. When they become ill, evil qi lingers and forms accumulations, damaging the relationship between spleen and stomach. If food and drink are further consumed without regard to temperature, evil energy that arrives will accumulate, leading to major gathering.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Internal Organs Chapter</strong></p>
<p>When the liver is elevated, it affects the upper diaphragm, causing the sides of the ribs to react in breathing.</p>
<p><em>Note: The liver meridian connects to the diaphragm and extends to the lungs, hence the effect on breathing and rib discomfort.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Water Distension Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What is the condition of the intestines? Qi Bo replied: Cold qi is lodged outside the intestines, clashing with the defensive qi, preventing the qi from nourishing, which causes it to become obstructed and accumulate internally, leading to the rise of evil qi and the formation of polyps. At the beginning, they are the size of a chicken egg, gradually growing larger until they resemble a child in the womb. If they persist, they may detach from the organs; when pressed, they feel firm, and when pushed, they can move. Menstrual issues occur timely; this is its indication.</p>
<p><em>Note: Cold qi outside the intestines clashes with the defensive qi, preventing it from nourishing properly. The obstruction happens due to intangible qi coming into conflict in the empty spaces outside the intestines, accumulating on the tangible membranes. Thus, the evil qi of blood and flesh arises, leading to the formation of these growths.</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>For a long time, it can separate from the membranes of the organs, like a fetus suspended in the womb, firm when pressed and movable when pushed, not involving the organs. Therefore, the monthly cycle occurs regularly; this is its sign. Huangdi asked: &quot;What about stone mass (shijia)?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Stone mass forms within the womb, where cold qi lingers at the entrance (zimen). The entrance is blocked, causing qi not to circulate, and the stagnant bad blood that should be expelled is retained, growing larger day by day, resembling a fetus. The monthly cycle does not occur regularly, all of this happens in women, and it can be guided downwards.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: Cold qi lingering at zimen leads to blockage, causing blood in the womb to stagnate instead of being expelled, forming masses that grow larger over time, resembling a fetus. Blood remains in the womb, hence the monthly cycle does not occur. These conditions all arise in women, and treatment can guide it downwards.)<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>The Beginning of All Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, saying: All illnesses begin with the changes of wind, rain, cold, heat, and with emotions such as joy and anger. When joy and anger are unregulated, they harm the internal organs; wind and rain harm the upper body; clear and damp conditions harm the lower body. The ailments caused by these three types differ, and I wish to learn about their connections. Qi Bo replied: The three types of energies are distinct. Some arise from yin, while others arise from yang; allow me to explain further! Unregulated joy and anger harm the internal organs; when the organs are harmed, illnesses arise from yin. When clear and damp conditions invade the weak, ailments arise from the lower body, and when wind and rain invade the weak, ailments arise from the upper body. This is what is meant by the three types. As for their overwhelming presence, it cannot be counted. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I indeed cannot enumerate them, which is why I ask the Sage. I wish to fully understand this path! Qi Bo said: Wind, rain, cold, and heat cannot independently harm a person without a state of deficiency. If one suddenly encounters strong winds or violent rain and does not fall ill, it is likely because there is no deficiency. Therefore, the evil cannot harm independently. This must be due to the deficiency of the external wind interacting with the body&#39;s state of deficiency, leading to an affliction upon the body. When two strong forces meet, the flesh of most people remains firm.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Among the virtual evils, they rely on the timing of heaven, the physical form, and the interplay of emptiness and substance, leading to significant illness. There are defined spaces for Qi, categorized based on location, with divisions among the outer, inner, and middle realms.</p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;virtual wind&quot; refers to the spring winds from the west and summer winds from the north, energies from the five elements that are not balanced, thus harming the body. If a person&#39;s Qi is not deficient, even if faced with virtual winds, they cannot be harmed. Thus, it&#39;s necessary that both the individual and the heavenly conditions are deficient, causing interaction of both deficiencies, leading to a weakening of the form, unlike the common people&#39;s strong flesh. The three divisions refer to the following: the virtual evil impacting people, the external causes of illness; the aggregation that has already developed, the internal causes; the emotional and desire-related injuries to the organs, the ailments residing in the Yin. These represent the three aspects of internal and external.]</p>
<p>Therefore, the influence of virtual evils on individuals begins at the skin. When the skin is relaxed, the pores open, allowing evil to enter through the hair. Once it enters deeply, the hair stands up, indicating discomfort, and thus the skin experiences pain. If it lingers and does not leave, it affects the vessels and channels. At the channel level, pain manifests in the muscles; when pain occurs, breathing becomes labored, and the major meridians are altered. If it remains, it affects the meridians. At the meridian level, there are symptoms of chills and sudden fright. If it persists, it impacts the channels. At the channel level, the six major meridians become blocked, leading to joint pain in the limbs, and stiffness in the lower back. If it continues to persist, it settles in the pulse of the Chong and Yin.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>During the time of伏冲 (Fu Chong), there is a heaviness and pain in the body. It lingers and does not leave, settling in the intestines and stomach. When in the intestines and stomach, there are sounds and bloating; if cold, there are rumblings and diarrhea, causing food to not digest; if hot, the result is a mucous-like discharge. If it lingers and does not leave, it transmits and settles outside the intestines and stomach, gathering in the vessels, stuck and not leaving, resting and forming a mass. It may affect the Sun meridian, or the collateral vessels, or the regular channels, or the Shu vessels, or the channels of伏冲, or affect the sinews, or abide in the intestines and stomach, reaching up to the ren vessels. The evil energy is pervasive and cannot be easily described. </p>
<p>(Note: The evil that invades the body must enter from the exterior. It starts at the skin; when a person&#39;s form is weak, the skin becomes lax, allowing the evil to take hold, causing the hair to stand on end, and blood and energy to stagnate, resulting in pain in the skin. Inspection of which channel is involved, whether deep or shallow, allows treatment from the exterior. If it lingers and does not leave, its entry becomes gradually deeper, hence it settles in the collateral vessels, causing pain between the muscles. If the muscle pain intermittently ceases, the evil will exit the collaterals and penetrate deeper, and the main channels will take on this condition; the evil energy enters the channels from the collaterals, still present in the exterior, hence causing chills and evil cold. However, the channel energy connects to the organs, so there is also a tendency to be startled.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The areas of the defeated are where the vital energies gather, and their lingering must be between the joints and valleys. Therefore, if the pathogenic factor remains in the defeated, the Six Meridians become obstructed, leading to pain and stiffness in the limbs, back, and waist. The &quot;Fuchong&quot; refers to the channel of counterflow within the abdomen. When the pathogen remains inside, the blood and vital energies cannot fill the body, resulting in heaviness and pain. If it lingers and does not depart, it transmits to the intestines and stomach, causing symptoms like abdominal distension and noises; too much cold leads to rumbling and diarrhea, while too much heat results in loose stools. Outside the intestines and stomach is the area known as &quot;Muyan,&quot; which refers to the outside of the skin and membranes. If it is detained there and does not leave, it stops and becomes a mass, similar to conditions like malaria and distension. The &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Luo&quot; channels are minor collateral channels within the &quot;Muyan&quot;; the meridians are the main channels of the stomach and intestines. The &quot;Shu&quot; channels are the major collaterals of the visceral organs, responsible for transporting the blood and vital energies of food and drink. The &quot;Fuchong&quot; flows within the abdominal channel. &quot;Muyan&quot; is akin to the acupoints &quot;Zhongfu&quot; as the meeting point and &quot;Taiyuan&quot; as the origin, and similar types. The &quot;Lujin&quot; are the muscles attached to the spine; the &quot;Huanjin&quot; are muscles circulating within the abdomen. These various factors are situated around, before, and after the intestines and stomach. Pathogenic factors accompany and cause accumulation, thus leading to numerous excesses. Huangdi said: &quot;I wish to hear more about the origins of this!&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The accumulations resulting from obstructions in the Sun collateral channels are those that move up and down. The arm is the residence of the hand&#39;s Sun collateral, which is floating and slack, thus unable to hold the accumulations in check.&quot;<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Therefore, the movement and flow within the stomach and intestines, as water seeps and pours in, is accompanied by a sound like bubbling. When there is cold, it is like thunder rumbling, causing sharp pain at times. When it affects the Yangming channel, it resides around the navel; when full from eating, it swells, and when hungry, it shrinks. When it relates to the relaxing of the muscles, it resembles the accumulation in Yangming; fullness causes pain, while hunger brings relief. When it pertains to the root of the stomach and intestines, pain radiates to the relaxing muscles; when full, there is relief, and hunger brings pain. When it concerns the penetrating vessel, it can be felt by palpation and moves upon touch, generating heat and causing qi to descend to the thighs, resembling the condition of being poured over by broth. When it involves the muscles behind the intestines, hunger reveals the blockages, while fullness hides them, and pressing does not yield any response. When it pertains to the pathways of the channels, they are blocked and stagnant, preventing fluids from descending, causing the openings and orifices to be obstructed. This is how pathogenic qi enters from outside and affects the interior from above and below. </p>
<p>(Note: This commentary on internal conditions focuses on the ability of accumulations to shift up and down within the intestines. Accumulations in the networks of the large and small intestines belong to the channels, wherein the networks are superficial and relaxed, unable to contain the accumulation and stop it, thus causing mobility within the stomach and intestines. If there is water, it seeps outward, creating a bubbling sound. If there is cold, it leads to bloating and rumbling akin to thunder, with associated sharp pain at times.)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The channels of the Yangming are the great connecting vessels of the stomach. Therefore, its accumulation is situated near the navel. When filled, the fluids of food and water pour outward, hence in great hunger, the fluids and blood are insufficient, leading to a smaller condition. The tension of the muscles between the sinews appears like the accumulation of Yangming. When full, it causes distension and pain; when hungry, the energy recedes and becomes stable. The membranes of the intestines and stomach are the origin of pain, connected through the tension of the muscles. When full, the fluids seep outward, providing comfort; when hungry, it becomes dry and painful. The channel of the Fu-Chong lies between the navel, hence it responds to the hand and moves. When the hand feels warmth, it indicates that the blood and energy of the Chong channel are abundant outward. Those resembling the state of being poured out are caused by accumulation and subsequently generate heat. The lumbar sinews are attached within the spine, behind the intestines; thus, when hungry, the intestines appear empty and visible, while when full, they are not visible and cannot be pressed. The transportation channels are meant to connect blood and energy; if blocked, then the fluids do not descend, causing the pores of the skin and hair to dry up.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: When the accumulation first arises until it is completed, what should be done? Qi Bo replied: When the accumulation first arises, it is caused by cold, and the stagnation leads to accumulation. The Yellow Emperor asked: How does it become fully accumulated? Qi Bo replied: The stagnation engenders cold in the feet, which causes the blood vessels to solidify. When the blood vessels solidify, the cold energy enters the intestines and stomach; once in the intestines and stomach, it causes bloating. The bloating then causes the fluids outside the intestines to gather and cannot disperse, accumulating day by day.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Suddenly overeating or drinking leads to a full intestine; irregular living and excessive exertion harm the meridians. If the yang meridians are damaged, blood leaks externally, resulting in nosebleeds; if the yin meridians are harmed, blood leaks internally, causing rectal bleeding. When the meridians of the intestines and stomach are injured, blood spills outside the intestines, mixing with cold fluids, which congeal with the blood, preventing dispersion and accumulating over time. </p>
<p>Suddenly exposed to cold externally, or suffering internal damage from worry and anger leads to reversed qi, causing obstruction of the six yang channels, preventing the flow of dampness, and coagulating blood, which then accumulates. Body fluids drip and do not disperse, leading to congestion. </p>
<p>[Note: Cold reverses downwards, causing pain and obstruction in the limbs, making movement inconvenient. When coldness enters through the legs, blood and qi congeal; this cold rises into the intestines and stomach, causing them to become cold, preventing yang qi from transforming and leading to distension. This distension results in fluids outside the intestines that accumulate and do not disperse over time. Sudden overeating or drinking may exceed the intestines&#39; capacity for processing, causing fluids to spill outside the membranes, mixing with blood, leading to food accumulation, similar to conditions in infants. Irregular living and excessive exertion may also harm the meridians. Damage to the upward-moving yang meridians causes blood to leak externally above, resulting in nosebleeds, whereas damage to the downward-moving yin meridians leads to internal bleeding below.]<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>When the channels of the stomach and intestines are injured, blood spills outside the intestines. If there is cold fluid and foam outside the intestines that clashes with the blood, it combines and凝聚成. Sometimes, sudden cold evil from outside, combined with internal injuries from worry and anger, causes qi to reverse upward. When qi reverses upward, the flow through the six channels becomes obstructed, the warming and nourishing energy fails to circulate, blood congeals and accumulates, and fluids become thick within the channels, seeping outside without dispersing and accumulating.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What about those conditions stemming from yin? Qibo replied: Worry and contemplation injure the heart; heavy cold injures the lungs; anger injures the liver; drunkenness in bed, with sweat under the wind, injures the spleen; excessive exertion, especially after sweat during intimacy, injures the kidneys. These are the illnesses born from both internal and external factors.</p>
<p>Note: Injury to the heart affects yang, injury to the lungs affects qi, injury to the liver affects blood, injury to the spleen affects the nourishing and protective aspect, and injury to the kidneys affects true yin. Any injury to the organs represents an illness born from yin.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should one treat this? Qibo answered: Observe where it hurts to understand its response; if there is excess or deficiency, supplement what is deficient and drain what is excessive, without going against the seasonal changes. This is called the ultimate treatment.</p>
<p>Note: Observing where it hurts and understanding its response is about accumulating knowledge of the five organs. By examining the left and right, upward and downward, one can correspond with the acupuncture points of the five organ channels, discerning excess and deficiency for treatment, without going against the seasonal changes. This is called the ultimate treatment.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</p>
<p>Division of the Five Organs</p>
<p>Illness can manifest as accumulation or aggregation; how can we distinguish between them? Accumulation pertains to yin qi, while aggregation pertains to yang qi. Therefore, accumulation is characterized by being deep and dormant, while aggregation is characterized by being superficial and active. What is called accumulation is named for where qi collects, and what is called aggregation is named for where qi congregates. Accumulation arises from the five organs, while aggregation is formed by the six fu organs. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a constant location for onset, with pain confined to its area, having an origin and limit both above and below, as well as side to side. Aggregation, being yang qi, has no fixed place for onset, with pain not confined to a specific area, thus called aggregation. Hence, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and aggregation. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the liver is called &quot;Fat Qi,&quot; located beneath the left ribs like a cup, having both a head and feet. If it does not heal for a long time, it may cause cough, fever, and malaria, lasting for years without relief. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the heart is called &quot;Hidden Beam,&quot; arising above the navel, as large as an arm, extending to beneath the heart. If it does not heal for a long time, it may lead to worrying and vexing the heart. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the spleen is known as &quot;Fullness Qi,&quot; situated in the stomach region, as large as a plate. If it does not heal for a long time, it may cause the limbs to wither, lead to jaundice, and prevent food from nourishing the skin. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the lungs is called &quot;Breath Distress,&quot; located beneath the right ribs, as large as a cup. If it lingers, it may cause chills and fever, cough, and lead to lung abscesses. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the kidneys is called &quot;Swollen Essence,&quot; originating in the lower abdomen and reaching beneath the heart, resembling a tumescent fish, moving up and down without a certain time. If it persists, it may lead to coughing, breathlessness, brittle bones, and shortness of breath.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty - Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>On Diseases, Pulses, Symptoms, and Treatments</strong></p>
<p>A question is asked: What do the terms accumulation, gathering, and (殸禾) qi refer to in diseases? The teacher replies: Accumulation refers to diseases of the organs which do not shift; gathering refers to diseases of the bowels which manifest at times, moving and shifting, making them treatable. (殸禾) qi refers to pain below the ribs that, when pressed, alleviates, but may recur as (殸禾) qi. The primary signs of accumulation are seen when the pulse is thin and adheres to the bone. The cun position indicates accumulation in the chest; when slightly protruding from the cun, accumulation is in the throat; at the guan position, it indicates accumulation near the navel; at the upper guan position, it is below the heart; slightly below the guan position, accumulation is in the lower abdomen; at the chi position, it is in the qi rushing area. If the pulse comes from the left, the accumulation is on the left; if it comes from the right, the accumulation is on the right; if it is bilateral, the accumulation is central. Each is treated according to its respective location.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The Book of Accumulation and Aggregation by Hua Tuo (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p>Accumulation, aggregation, symptoms, and parasites arise when the true qi of the five organs and six bowels is lost and邪气 (evil qi) invades. Over time, if not removed, they can manifest as accumulations or aggregates, symptoms or lumps, and can transform or act as parasites, each presenting differently. Some can harm people, while others cannot. Some are slow to cause illness, while others act quickly. Some cause pain, while others cause itching. Some arise in the head or limbs, while others have a solid form. Their manifestations vary widely.</p>
<p>This is a result of mutual influences between the internal and external, the true and the evil, where qi and blood conflict and combine. Accumulations are connected to the organs, aggregates to the bowels, symptoms to qi, lumps to blood, and parasites arise from the interactions of blood, qi, and food. There are five types of accumulations, six types of aggregates, twelve types of symptoms, eight types of lumps, and nine types of parasites, with names that vary.</p>
<p>The five accumulations are named after the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys; the six aggregates are named after the large intestine, small intestine, gallbladder, stomach, bladder, and triple warmer; the twelve symptoms include labor, qi, cold, heat, deficiency, excess, wind, dampness, food, medicine, thought, and worry; the eight lumps include blue, yellow, dryness, blood, fat, fox, snake, and turtle; the nine parasites are named as hookworm, roundworm, white worm, flesh-eating worm, lung worm, stomach worm, red worm, weak worm, and pinworm.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>By Sun Simiao of the Tang Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Between Accumulation and Gathering</strong></p>
<p>Disease can be either accumulation or gathering; how can we differentiate between them? The answer is: accumulation is yin qi, whereas gathering is yang qi. Thus, accumulation is heavy and dormant, while gathering is light and dynamic. What is stored as accumulation is termed &quot;accumulation,&quot; and what is concentrated as gathering is termed &quot;gathering.&quot; Therefore, accumulation is generated by the five viscera, while gathering is formed by the six intestines. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a constant place of origin, its pain remains localized, and it has clear beginnings and ends above and below, as well as defined limits to the left and right. Gathering, being yang qi, has no fixed origin, it does not stop above and below, and its pain lacks a specific location, hence it is referred to as gathering. Thus, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and gathering.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>On Treating Accumulations</strong></p>
<p>There are five accumulations and six gatherings. Accumulations arise from the yin energy of the five organs; gatherings are formed from the yang energy of the six intestines. This occurs due to the disharmony of yin and yang, the weakness of the organs, and the invasion of pathogenic wind, leading to the formation of accumulations and gatherings. </p>
<p>Just like the emotions of worry, gratitude, joy, and anger, which are inescapable for humans, excess can harm the five organs, disrupt the four seasons, and create blockages, which then solidify into the five accumulations. Thus, in the liver, it is called &quot;fatty qi,&quot; in the heart it is &quot;hidden beam,&quot; in the spleen it is &quot;stomach distension,&quot; in the lungs it is &quot;breath disturbance,&quot; and in the kidneys it is &quot;running piglet.&quot; Though the names differ, the symptoms are also distinct. </p>
<p>The manifestation of &quot;fatty qi&quot; is observed under the left rib, covering a large area like a cup, being large and bulbous, resembling a head and feet, indicating liver accumulation. The pulse is thin and wiry, the complexion is blue, and symptoms include pain in the sides, pulling in the lower abdomen, cold feet, muscle cramps, with males presenting as hernia and females as masses.</p>
<p>The manifestation of &quot;hidden beam&quot; starts below the navel and is as large as an arm, rising to beneath the heart, resembling a beam across the chest diaphragm, indicating heart accumulation. The pulse is deep and hollow, the complexion is red, and symptoms include abdominal heat, red face, dry throat, heart vexation, and in severe cases, vomiting blood, leading to reduced appetite and weight loss.</p>
<p>The manifestation of &quot;stomach distension&quot; is situated in the epigastrium, covering a large area like a cup, being obstructed and unyielding, indicating spleen accumulation. The pulse is floating, large, and long, the complexion is yellow, and symptoms include decreased appetite when hungry, increased discomfort when full, abdominal fullness, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen feet, and muscle wasting, persisting for a long time without improvement.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The condition known as “Xi Ben” appears beneath the right ribs, large like a cup, with labored breathing and overflowing signs; this is called lung accumulation. Upon examining the pulse, it is floating and feeble, the complexion is pale, and the disease manifests as rebellious qi, back pain, shortness of breath, a tendency to forgetfulness, closed eyes, cold skin, and intermittent pain within the flesh, sometimes like the sensation of lice crawling or like the prick of a needle. </p>
<p>The condition known as “Ben Tun” arises from the lower abdomen, rising up to the heart area, occurring intermittently, and resembling a pig running; this is called kidney accumulation. Examining the pulse reveals it to be deep and urgent, the complexion is dark, and the symptoms are evident when hungry, reducing when full; there is urgency in the lower abdomen, lower back pain, dry mouth, blurred vision, cold bones, and prolonged illness leads to bone atrophy and shortness of breath. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when examining the six accumulations in the six bowels, the condition is different. How so? The six bowels belong to the three Yangs; Tai Yang expels clear qi, Yang Ming releases turbid qi, and Shao Yang transforms essential qi, functioning like the capital within a city, responsible for the regular transport and transformation of qi. If the six bowels become unbalanced, evil qi accumulates and does not disperse, starting with no fundamental root, unstopping above and below, thus pain lacks a constant location; if pain occurs above, it feels constrained, and below, it feels distended, with pain on both sides as if there were a solid mass that is easily rotated, hence it is different from the five accumulations.</p>
<p>In general, when examining pulses, a tight and surging pulse indicates accumulation, a floating yet firm pulse indicates accumulation, a horizontal pulse indicates accumulation beneath the ribs, and a small, deep, firm pulse indicates accumulation in the stomach. Overall, each illness presents its signs, and treatments have their respective methods. For example, in diagnosing abdominal accumulations, a firm, strong, urgent pulse indicates life, while a weak, urgent pulse indicates death. Similarly, strong and firm pulses point towards life, while weak, small pulses indicate death. This should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Summary of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>Symptoms refer to hardness in the abdomen that is palpable when pressed. &quot;The Sacred Remedy&quot; states: Symptoms are akin to signs. Water should be soft and yielding, yet now it is hard like the earth; excess leads to harm, so one must contain it. Therefore, excessive dampness causes illnesses like spasms, which also involve the influence of wind. An excess of wind illness leads to dryness, causing the tendons and vessels to become tense, which also includes the influence of metal. An excess of dryness results in irritability and thirst, coupled with the influence of fire. Excessive heat can lead to the expulsion of bodily fluids, resulting in shivering and cold, which also involves the influence of water. </p>
<p>In treatment, one should simply purge the excessive pathogenic energy as the root of the illness, without mistakenly treating the accompanying transformations.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>However, those who integrate transformations are following the way of heaven’s mechanisms and transformations, which, though present in the faint and nebulous, embody natural principles that are not manifest but have substance. Illness, though it arises from imbalance, is within the pursuit of transformation. The principles of the five elements can extend to the extent that they can also restrain each other, leading to the cessation of transformation. </p>
<p>When the wind and wood are vigorous and there is much wind, a strong wind will cause the temperature to drop—this is the wood being restrained by metal. Under intense cold, the air will become warmer—this is fire being supported by metal. When the summer heat reaches its peak, its essence will release moisture—this is fire being restrained by water. Consequently, the humid steam leads to clouds and rain, as earth transforms from water. When rain becomes excessive and is accompanied by fierce winds, wood restrains the earth. </p>
<p>Amidst the swirling winds, the autumn wind brings a chill, as metal is supported by wood. Once the chill reaches its extreme, all things become dry, as fire restrains metal. Consequently, winter cold is produced, as water transforms from fire. When the cold becomes extreme, water solidifies like earth, as earth restrains water.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>When the ice and frost freeze completely, the eastern wind arises, transforming wood to support the earth, completing the cycle of the year. Those who do not understand the symptoms and roots of illness do so because they are unaware of this principle of change. </p>
<p>A lump (瘕) may feel hard in the abdomen, but it can suddenly gather or disperse, lacking a constant measure. Thus, the &quot;Holy Prescriptions&quot; states: a lump is akin to a falsehood, as its condition has not yet developed into a definitive ailment. The classical interpretation mentions: when blood does not flow and cold thins it, the blood remains stagnant within, forming a lump. Another explanation posits that it is a condition of accumulation in the abdomen. The classics say that heat from the small intestine moves to the large intestine and causes the condition known as &quot;lump&quot; or &quot;sinking.&quot; The commentary notes that when the heat from the small intestine has already shifted into the large intestine, the two heats clash, resulting in blood overflow and forming a concealed lump. If the blood is stagnant and does not flow, it causes menstruation to be obstructed and not proceed, hence the term &quot;lump&quot; is associated with &quot;sinking.&quot; &quot;Lump&quot; and &quot;concealment&quot; are synonymous. The lump can also refer to a hernia, a transcription error. Therefore, the classical texts indicate that there can also be heat associated with the condition of a lump.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>When yang energy is stagnant, with heat accumulating and hardening without dissipating, it is not a cold syndrome, and should be differentiated by pulse and symptoms. The transfer of heat from the greater yang affecting the small intestine is called &quot;excessive accumulation,&quot; where the fluids are depleted and cannot smooth and facilitate the bowels, leading to stagnation in the large intestine, which is managed by areca nut.</p>
<p>In cases of fullness below the ribs, with persistent counterflow of qi, where qi accumulates below the ribs, it breathes but does not dissipate, accumulating without dispersing, and the vital energy is in the stomach, obstructing food and drink, needling is not appropriate; it is better to use guiding methods and medication, with Baizhu pills prescribed.</p>
<p>Water loses its ability to disperse when dry and cannot dissipate when moist, resulting in fluid accumulation. Transmission of disease to the weaker organ can lead to death, whereas disease that does not transfer can be treated. For example, if lung disease transmits to the liver, and liver disease affects the spleen, spleen disease influences the kidneys, kidney disease impacts the heart, and heart disease transmits back to the lungs, each is influenced by the weaker organ. </p>
<p>When the qi of the five organs is deficient, and various external evils invade, it results in stagnation and accumulation. The pulse felt will be deep, thin, and weak.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Ruzhong&#39;s Filial Duty (by Zhang Congzheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Treatment of the Same and the Melancholic</strong></p>
<p>The sages have spoken clearly about the five accumulations and six conglomerations, yet the treatment methods remain obscure. They explain the five accumulations as follows: The accumulation of the liver is called &quot;fatty qi,&quot; located under the left rib, resembling an overturned cup; it has heads and feet. If it lasts for a long time, it may cause coughing, reverse fever, and intermittent malaria. For those who suffer from this for years, it is the result. The accumulation of the heart is known as &quot;the hidden beam,&quot; arising from the navel, as large as an arm, extending upward to below the heart. If it persists for a long time, it may lead to restlessness and mental distress. The accumulation of the spleen is referred to as &quot;spleen qi,&quot; located in the stomach area, covering like a large dish. If it lasts for long, it may result in limbs becoming withdrawn and jaundice appearing, causing food not to nourish the skin, popularly known as &quot;food labor yellow.&quot; The accumulation of the lungs is called &quot;breath obstruction,&quot; situated under the left rib and covering like a cup. If it does not heal for long, it can lead to chills, fever, coughing, or lung abscesses. The accumulation of the kidneys is termed &quot;turtle obstruction,&quot; originating in the lower abdomen and extending upward to below the heart, resembling a turtle in shape; it may fluctuate between upward and downward without a set time. If it persists for a long time, it can cause breathlessness, backward chi, bone atrophy, and shortness of breath.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The conditions of these five accumulations, as stated by the sages of old, are clear indeed. Upon visiting various medical practitioners, everyone can articulate this, and when asked about treatment methods, they merely mention substances like three-edged needles, guo herbs, lacquer, ochre, dried tangerine peel, mung stone, and castor beans. There are also those who, lacking clear differentiation between root and branch, attempt to supplement this understanding. Is it possible for a person suffering from accumulation, with major evil not having been expelled, to remedy it? As for the medicines commercially available for accumulation, I, when I was a novice in medicine, if I had ever used them, found them ineffective, and thus chose to change my approach. By studying the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; I suddenly had a profound realization. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Wood congestion leads to vomiting, Fire congestion results in sweating, Earth congestion causes purging, Metal congestion leads to urination, and Water congestion causes reversal. Wang Taifu explained: “Vomit” refers to expelling through the mouth; “sweat” refers to perspiration; “purge” refers to bowel movements; “urinate” refers to relieving the bladder; “reversal” refers to countering the obstruction. These five methods are governed by the five movements, hence these five treatment strategies are established, seemingly in alignment with the five accumulations.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The five accumulations arise when one is affected by the pathogenic influences that defeat oneself and then passes this onto those one has defeated. During times of abundance, these influences are resisted and not accepted, returning instead to the ones that defeat oneself. The ones that defeat oneself refuse to accept this, thus leading to the formation of an accumulation. </p>
<p>Therefore, the accumulation of the liver occurs on the day of Ji in late summer, the accumulation of the heart occurs on the days of Geng and Xin in autumn, the accumulation of the spleen occurs on the days of Ren and Gui in winter, the accumulation of the lungs occurs on the days of Jia and Yi in spring, and the accumulation of the kidneys occurs on the days of Bing and Ding in summer. All of these are due to oppression and withholding of the vital energy that is affected by pathogenic factors. Is it necessary to wait for the celestial authorities to intervene before these accumulations occur?</p>
<p>Moreover, the formation of these accumulations may be caused by aggressive emotions such as anger and joy or by sadness and fear; it may also be influenced by the consumption of certain foods that are sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, or salty, or by the intake of drinks that are warm, cool, hot, cold, or damp. Initial symptoms are often very slight, and breathing techniques or gentle pressure can often disperse them. Unfortunately, if one encounters an inept doctor who forcefully reinforces the condition, it will remain and eventually lead to the five accumulations. The essence of the fatty qi is not only an excess of qi but also involves blood, due to the liver&#39;s role in storing blood.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The &quot;Fu Liang&quot; condition refers to a build-up of heat, which, when treated with hot medicine, worsens, while cauterization causes it to accumulate further. Moreover, there are two types of &quot;Fu Liang,&quot; which share the same name but differ in essence, requiring detailed explanation. </p>
<p>The first type has roots in all directions—up, down, left, and right—existing outside the intestines and stomach, accompanied by significant pus and blood. This type is similar to an abdominal abscess. </p>
<p>The second type presents swelling in the body, especially around the hips, thighs, and knees, with pain surrounding the navel. This is due to the root of wind and must not be moved; if moved, it can lead to water retention and difficulties with urination. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that while these conditions should not be agitated, it refers to avoiding major purging rather than complete avoidance of treatment, as doing so may cause harm when the illness subsides.</p>
<p>Regarding &quot;Pi Qi,&quot; it is commonly stated that cold leads to stagnation, but the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; considers dampness to be the culprit. Even if it arises from consuming cold drinks, the yang energy is trapped by the dampness. If attacked with heat, it does not disperse, but if with cold, the dampness leaves while the cold retreats.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Xi Ben,&quot; it refers to the breath becoming short and rising upwards, which is an old interpretation. I believe &quot;Ben&quot; pertains to the gate known as &quot;Ben Men,&quot; associated with the Hand Taiyin meridian. This connects the chest and penetrates the diaphragm, extending to the lower ribs. The symptoms include muscle pain, and in severe cases, this can lead to &quot;Xi Ben.&quot;<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The palm of the hand is associated with the arm, and its ailment manifests as chest pain and breathing difficulties. Additionally, if the lungs are low, it presses on the liver, causing pain in the sides. If the liver is high, it affects the upper region, leading to lateral discomfort. If we speak of this, it indicates stagnant energy in the chest that does not disperse. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; mentions that this kind of respiratory issue is frequent in relation to the five organs; hence I bring it up. The term &quot;chest distress,&quot; akin to &quot;chest heaving,&quot; is noted in &quot;The Copper Man,&quot; which suggests it may arise from excessive reading, though this isn’t universally applicable. The kidneys govern the bones, and this accumulation is the most profound and difficult to treat. It is crucial to avoid inducing vomiting. Since it is located below, it is best to expel it from below. Therefore, I have previously used &quot;Dusheng San&quot; to expel damp energy, combined with a wooden frame, ensuring it is in a warm room to facilitate both vomiting and sweating. The accumulation in the liver is said to relate to wind. After expelling several liters, one must expect a drop or two of blood; do not doubt this as it is expected in illness. Follow with herbs that direct and regulate the accumulation, having treated concealed phlegm first using tea to adjust and induce vomiting simultaneously with sweating, and then use herbs to lower internal heat.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>I have also treated issues of stagnation with great success. First, use the gourd stem powder to expel the sour, bitter, yellow, sticky, and rotten substances—about three to two sheng. Next, direct water using the methods of Yu to flow down two or three dozen times. Finally, mix in lighter herbal prescriptions like the Wu Ling San. I have also treated hiccups using the gourd stem powder, regardless of the season, placing it in a warm room, with an additional fire to assist sweating, and employing methods of inducing sweat and purging simultaneously. This condition should not be taken lightly; prolonged treatment can harm a person. I have also treated phlegm buildup by directing water to clear the channels, achieving results with one purge every three days, ten times in a month, totaling a hundred sessions over time. After that, I use active blood-moving and qi-transforming herbs to grind away the accumulation. Although this accumulation does not harm the body, it can lead to a shortened lifespan. For substances in the six accumulations, located in the organs and associated with yang, they are formless and lack a fixed treatment method; treating them in this manner is not difficult. Some say my treatment for accumulation is too severe. I respond, it is not so. Accumulation in the organs, like sediment in rivers, comes from multiple layers of fat membranes in convoluted passages, within the complex anatomy.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>In the rivers and lakes, sediment is not found in the middle flow but often in the shallow bays and bends; when encountering overflow, it is swept away in a drift. Likewise, when it accumulates in the internal organs, the principle is the same. Therefore, I first use pills to eliminate recently ingested food, ensuring there are no blockages, leaving the broken-down remnants still displaced but not yet expelled; next, I use powdered medicine to fill the stomach and push everything down, like a raft navigating the river, clearing everything at once. If anything remains, I adjust with medicine. Only hard accumulations should not be treated this way and should be gradually removed. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: for hard accumulations, one must cut them away. This is what people nowadays refer to as mass disorders.</p>
<p>For food accumulation: sourness in the stomach and fullness, herbs such as rhubarb and cowbane, worse cases involve muconate and croton. For wine accumulation: yellowing eyes and dry mouth, herbs like pueraria and wheat bran, serious cases include euphorbia and cowbane. For qi accumulation: belching and a feeling of oppression, herbs like aloes and areca nut, severe cases include bitter orange and cowbane. For phlegm accumulation: a throat feeling like it is being sawed, minerals like cinnabar and talc, in more severe cases, gourd seeds and euphorbia.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Phlegm accumulation leads to thick and sticky saliva. For this, half summer and southern star type herbs can be used; in severe cases, gourd calyx and zhiling can be considered. For stubborn accumulation causing stabbing pain in the sides, three-edged and broadleaf herbs can help; in worse cases, glycyrrhiza and scorpion&#39;s tail may be necessary. Water accumulation results in swollen legs and shins; for this, plum tree and commercial land can be used, with severe cases needing glycyrrhiza and candytuft. Blood accumulation manifests as bruises and stagnation, especially postpartum; herb peach pits and earth elm are suitable, with worse cases requiring wasp and leech. Flesh accumulation appears as lumps or tumors; for this, greasy powder and white lilac should be applied, possibly leading to bleeding through needle acupuncture; in severe circumstances, mine sand and trust stone might be used.</p>
<p>All nine types of accumulation are primarily based on qi, each needing targeted treatment according to their characteristics. Modern practitioners lump all these herbs together into one formula, claiming it can treat all accumulations – a grave error. Without the corresponding illness, why use this remedy? Without that condition, why employ that herb? With nine sheep herding ten goats, where should one turn? This approach not only lacks benefit but can also be harmful.</p>
<p>For unresolved accumulations, a remedy called &quot;Wuyou San&quot; can be taken, allowing for three to five bowel movements each month; one may also consider &quot;Gui Ling Bai Zhu San&quot; or &quot;Miao Gong Wan.&quot; It is crucial to avoid consuming hard, sticky foods, wind-induced substances, and heating items.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Healing Methods</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Jieg Ancient)</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Cultivate the Right and Eliminate the Wrong</strong><a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>A robust person has no accumulation, but a weak person does. When the spleen and stomach are weak, and both qi and blood are deficient, one can feel the effects throughout the four seasons, which can lead to accumulation. If one hastily treats this with harsh medicines to break the accumulation, the disease may go, but the person&#39;s health will have already declined. Medicines like lacquer, sand, rush, rhubarb, and kalonia may provide temporary relief, but once the effect is gone, the problem persists. As qi diminishes and the disease worsens, what benefit is there? Therefore, when treating accumulation, one must first nourish the proper energies; then the accumulation will naturally resolve. For instance, if a gathering is composed entirely of gentlemen, even if there is one petty person, he will have no place to remain. As long as true qi is substantial and the gastric qi is strong, the accumulation will dissolve on its own. If there is substantial accumulation made of foul substances, one must be cautious with potent medicines; how much more so when dealing with a weak person with accumulation? This is one aspect of treating accumulation. The balance of evil and proper energies should be examined thoroughly.</p>
<p>Regarding clinical practice:</p>
<p>A distended mass in the center indicates phlegm and fluid; on the right, it indicates food accumulation; on the left, it indicates blood stasis. Qi cannot form a block or gather; a block is a tangible thing formed by phlegm, food accumulation, and stagnant blood. Use vinegar to boil sea stones, vinegar to boil rush, things like wormwood, peach kernels, safflower, myrrh, and cyperus to make pills, and swallow them with alkaline white atractylodes decoction. To treat the block, one must lower heat and disperse food accumulation, as food accumulation is also phlegm. To move stagnant blood, one must nourish significantly once the block is expelled. Accumulation disease should not be treated with purgatives, as they merely deplete the true qi, and the illness will not be resolved. Instead, one must use medicines that dissolve and melt the accumulation, thus eradicating the root cause. In general, if a woman has a mass, it is often due to blood stasis.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The accumulation in the five organs is called the five accumulations, while the accumulation in the six bowels is called the six collections. Accumulations have a definite shape, while collections have no fixed location. Regardless of which classic you refer to, it is advisable to take the Ten-Flavor Great Seven Qi Decoction and swallow the esteemed Red Pill.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Classic of Needle Therapy&quot; from the Yellow Emperor, it states: How does the intestine swell? Qi Bo replies: Cold qi lingers outside the intestines, clashing with the defensive qi, which cannot nourish properly. This leads to binding and internal attachment, causing bad qi to arise and polyps to develop. Initially, they are as large as a chicken egg, gradually growing larger until they resemble a child in the womb. If they persist for a long time, they’ll separate from the years, feeling solid when pressed and moving when pushed. They align with the menstrual cycle; this is its sign. The intestine refers to the large intestine, which is responsible for conduction and is associated with the lung. The lung governs the defensive qi, which is the vital energy; it disperses with warmth and solidifies with cold. Currently, cold lingers in the large intestine, causing the defensive qi to fail in nourishing, resulting in binding and the formation of stagnation internally. When this persists, it is called intestinal swelling. When qi disperses, it is clear; when qi collects, it is turbid. This stagnation leads to the rise of bad qi and the formation of polyps, gradually increasing in size until the abdomen swells, resembling that of a pregnant woman.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>This condition arises from a deficiency in qi leading to a blood stagnation, hence the menstrual flow is irregular and does not occur as it should. This is not due to conception, and can be identified as such. Furthermore, when it comes to stone obstruction, Qi Bo said: stone obstruction occurs within the womb, caused by cold energy obstructing the uterine orifice. When the orifice is closed, it prevents the smooth flow of qi and causes stagnant blood that should flow out but does not, resulting in retention and growing larger over time, resembling pregnancy. The menstrual flow does not occur timely and these issues arise in women, and can be guided to flow downwards. The bladder serves as a reservoir for fluids; when qi transforms, it can be expelled. Now, if cold lodges in the uterine orifice, qi becomes blocked and stagnant, causing blood to accumulate and not flow. Retention becomes hardened like stone, which is known as stone obstruction. This illness begins as a qi condition followed by a blood condition, hence the absence of menstruation makes it possible to address and release the blockage. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: when deficient, it leads to internal stagnation, with men suffering from seven types of hernias and women experiencing obstructions. This is what is meant. Only potent herbal remedies can resolve it, such as the Jianxuan pill can be taken.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Formation of Food Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>When a person&#39;s spleen and stomach are weak, whether due to excessive eating, frequent consumption of cold foods, or the inability to properly digest, it leads to the formation of accumulations and clumps, causing fullness in the heart and abdomen, sighing, sour regurgitation, a pale face, and a thin body. </p>
<p>There are ten types of accumulations: </p>
<ol>
<li>Food accumulation </li>
<li>Alcohol accumulation </li>
<li>Grain accumulation </li>
<li>Meat accumulation </li>
<li>Fish and crab accumulation </li>
<li>Fruit and vegetable accumulation </li>
<li>Tea accumulation </li>
<li>Water accumulation </li>
<li>Blood accumulation </li>
<li>Worm accumulation</li>
</ol>
<p>When food does not digest, leading to a feeling of heaviness and stagnation, it is advisable to use Ping Wei San with added Suan Zha, Xiang Fu, Shen Qu, Mai Ya, and Sheng Jiang. For accumulations resulting from alcohol, the face appears yellow and black, with occasional vomiting of phlegm and water; in such cases, Di Jin Yin Zi with added Ge Gen, Chi Fu Ling, Suan Zha, and Shen Qu is recommended. </p>
<p>If food is overconsumed, resulting in accumulation, use Lai Fu Zi Tang with added Ai Wei Yuan. For meat accumulation, Ai Wei Yuan is suggested. For excessive fish and crab consumption leading to accumulation, Xiang Su San with extra Sheng Jiang and Mu Xiang should be taken. </p>
<p>If fruit and vegetable accumulation occurs, Gui Xiang Wan is advised. For those who excessively consume tea or drink dry tea, Xing Zhu Wan, or the powdered form of gypsum, Huang Qin, and Sheng Ma mixed with sugar water is recommended. </p>
<p>For excessive drinking of water and juice leading to accumulation, with pulling pain in the chest and sides, and gurgling sounds, Shi Zao Tang should be used. </p>
<p>For blood stasis accumulation, either due to trauma or falling, causing it to settle in the chest and abdomen, resulting in a yellow face and dark stools, Di Dang Tang is recommended. </p>
<p>When food accumulations transform into worms, Miao Ying Wan is to be used.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p>
<h3>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment by Dai Sigong (Ming Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</h4>
<p>If there is a drinking habit that forms a mass between the abdomen and ribs, resembling a form of accumulation, the use of breaking drugs is often ineffective. Instead, one should address the drinking issue and prescribe a phlegm-dispelling decoction. How to identify it as a drinking issue? The patient previously suffered from phlegm, experiencing excessive saliva, or has a longstanding phlegm condition. </p>
<p>For those with a drinking habit forming a drinking mass, resulting in abdominal bloating, pain, or even whole body swelling, along with yellowed skin and poor appetite, a decoction of ten ingredients known as the Great Seven Qi Decoction with red wine should be prepared and taken.</p>
<p>If there is an accumulation in the liver located beneath the left rib, shaped like an inverted cup or resembling a turtle, accompanied by nausea, pain in both sides, pulling sensation in the lower abdomen, cold feet, and cramping, over time, this can resemble malaria, termed &quot;fat qi.&quot; The Great Seven Qi Decoction should be used; after cooking and cooling, take an iron implement, heat it until red-hot, and pour it over the medicine to be taken while hot.</p>
<p>For a lung accumulation situated beneath the right rib, comparable to an inverted cup, if there is reversed qi with back pain, shortness of breath with a tendency to forget, cold skin, and intermittent pain in the skin like being pricked by lice, over time, this can lead to coughing and wheezing, known as &quot;xi bing.&quot; The Great Seven Qi Decoction should be administered, adding mulberry bark, pinellia, and apricot kernels, each at half a qian.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The heart accumulates below the navel, reaching to the heart, as large as an arm, with a feeling of heat in the abdomen, dryness in the throat, and irritability; in severe cases, there may be vomiting of blood, known as &quot;伏梁&quot; (Fú Liáng). It is suitable to use the Great Seven Qi Decoction with half a coin each of Stone Acorus and Pinellia.</p>
<p>The spleen accumulates in the stomach area, as large as an overturned cup, causing blockage, back pain, heart discomfort, reduced hunger and increased fullness, abdominal distention, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen feet, and loss of flesh. If prolonged, the extremities may become unresponsive, known as &quot;痞气&quot; (Pǐ Qì). It is best to use the Great Seven Qi Decoction with red round pills.</p>
<p>Kidney accumulation occurs in the lower abdomen, rushing upwards to the heart, without a fixed pattern, like a rushing piglet. There may be reduced hunger with increased fullness, urgent sensations in the lower abdomen, lower back pain, mouth dryness, dim vision, and cold bones. If prolonged, it may lead to bone weakness, known as &quot;奔豚&quot; (Bēn Tún). It is advisable to use the Great Seven Qi Decoction with double the amount of cinnamon and half a coin each of fennel and fried Melia fruit.</p>
<p>If there are sensations in the abdomen akin to a mass or distension, moving with the qi up and down, without a fixed location, it is appropriate to use the Scatter and Gather Decoction.</p>
<p>If there is pain caused by qi, wandering between the heart and abdomen, attacking upwards and downwards with a sound like thunder, it may be a formed mass or not; using a whole scorpion, crushed and boiled into a decoction, in combination with Suhexiang Pills is recommended.</p>
<p>If there is a proper accumulation site, internal heat like fire gradually affecting the limbs, occurring several times a day over two or three days before improvement, it is inappropriate to attack the heat.</p>
<p>There may also be original febrile illnesses, with heat remaining and not dissipating, leading to symptoms and masses; in this case, it is necessary to use heat-reducing agents concurrently.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Accumulation and Gathering</p>
<pre><code>      Introduction to Medicine 【Ming Dynasty - Li Chen】

          All accumulations pertain to the Spleen
</code></pre>
<p>The classics state: Accumulation disorders, masses, and fullness are all due to the damp earth energy of the Taiyin. They initially arise from external influences or internal injuries causing qi stagnation. If treatment mistakenly supplements, it can lead to the formation of accumulation. Accumulation pertains to the yin energy dominating the five organs, with the pulse being deep and hidden. It may be found on either the left or the right, with roots felt, and pain has a consistent location. </p>
<p>Liver accumulation beneath the left ribs is called &quot;fat qi,&quot; indicating an excess of wind qi causing stagnation in blood, leading to rib pain or intermittent fevers. Heart accumulation above the umbilicus is named &quot;suspended beam,&quot; suggesting a beam-like obstruction beneath the heart that causes irritability, resulting from stifled fire. Hot medicine and moxibustion should be avoided. </p>
<p>Intestinal abscesses are similar; however, they present with swelling of the body, thighs, and back, with pain around the navel indicating an abscess. Spleen accumulation in the upper right abdomen is referred to as “distended qi,” wherein the yang qi is burdened by dampness, causing jaundice and fatigue, and food does not nourish the skin. Hot medicines are also to be avoided here. </p>
<p>Lung accumulation beneath the right ribs is called &quot;breath obstruction,&quot; indicating rapid and upward flowing breath, leading to coughing and lung abscess. Kidney accumulation occurs in the lower abdomen, or beneath the heart is termed &quot;running pig,&quot; evoking the image of a pig’s chaotic movement, causing alternating breath and bone atrophy, which is particularly difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Do not hastily induce vomiting or purging for any of these accumulations, as it merely depletes true qi without resolving the accumulation itself. Inducing vomiting for &quot;running pig&quot; is especially ill-advised. </p>
<p>There are five accumulations from ancient times, and today, the enhancement and adjustment of the five accumulation pills are even more refined.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The accumulation is formed by the Yang energy of the six bowels, with the pulse being submerged and knotty, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, hair without roots, pain without a fixed place. Use Sanju Decoction, Qiqi Decoction, Da Awei Pill, Xiangling Pill, and Da An Pill with ginseng. </p>
<p>Accumulation initially manifests as cold, so it is suitable to use warming and dispersing methods with formulas like Great Qiqi Decoction and Black and White Pill. If it persists and becomes hot, it should be treated with warming and cooling methods such as Mukxiang Binglang Pill and Tongyuan Erba Dan. If there are parasites, use Miaoying Pill. For external treatment, use San Sheng Gao, Sanling Decoction, and Shenyang Awei Powder.</p>
<p>Moreover, Yang deficiency with accumulation is easier to treat, but Yin deficiency is difficult to remedy intensively. For phlegm accumulation, it is best to avoid stagnating medicines and to take nourishing medicines mixed with tortoise shell, turtle shell, autumn stone, and cinnabar. Take Zhilv Pill, Da An Pill, or Su Bie Pill at noon; these are good for dissolving and transforming.</p>
<p>If phlegm accumulation is accompanied by cold stagnation at the navel and is mistakenly thought to be chronic coldness, using ginger and attaching warming medicine may initially seem appropriate but can worsen phlegm accumulation over time, harming the true Qi and depleting Yin blood. However, substances like sulfur and Aconite must not be taken, just as Zhi, Ba, and Mendo cold and cool substances that harm the spleen and stagnate Qi are also unsuitable. </p>
<p>The ancients said: &quot;Diminish it by more than half and then stop.&quot; They also said: &quot;Nourishing the upright will naturally eliminate accumulation.&quot; This refers to cases of deficiency leading to accumulation. In addition to gradual tonification, one must also cut down on rich flavors, moderate desires, restrain violent anger, and maintain proper thoughts; this will help achieve overall health.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p>
<h3>Masses</h3>
<p>Phlegm masses can form into lumps from phlegm and food accumulation of stagnant blood, and these are categorized as accumulations. When the accumulation forms a lump that does not move, it is called a &quot;symptom,&quot; indicating hardness and firmness. Those that may or may not be present, that can be found above or below, or to the left or right, are called &quot;masses,&quot; indicating a shape formed from pseudo-blood that shows movement and has vitality. </p>
<p>For treatment on the left, one should focus on breaking the blood, using Hai Shi Wan or Dang Gui Long Hui Wan with five qian, adding one liang each of Tao Ren and Jiang Huang, then make into honey pills. For the right, one should regulate the qi using Qing Pi Tang or Mu Xiang Fen Qi Wan. </p>
<p>In cases of accumulation, use Xiao Jin Zuo Zhi San, Hong Wan Zi, Xiao A Wei Wan, or Dang Gui Long Hui Wan, and Bao He Wan, all with the addition of pigeon droppings. </p>
<p>For pathways of food and drink, emotional stress can lead to phlegm accumulation, treated with Shi Lian Wan or Bai Jie Wan. All masses beneath the skin membrane should be treated with Er Chen Tang, supplemented with qi tonics and qi-moving herbs.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Medical Canon Must-Read</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Principles of Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>When the accumulation of illness occurs, it is due to insufficient righteous qi allowing the malevolent qi to take hold, much like petty individuals in the court when the gentlemen weaken. Righteous qi and malevolent qi cannot coexist; when one rises, the other falls. As malevolent qi increases, righteous qi declines; if one does not attack it, loss will follow. However, if one attacks too hastily, righteous qi may be harmed. The three phases of treatment must be understood: </p>
<p>First, when the illness is newly arising, righteous qi is still strong and malevolent qi is shallow; it can be allowed to be attacked. </p>
<p>Second, when the illness has persisted longer, malevolent qi is deeper and righteous qi is weaker; one should both attack and supplement. </p>
<p>Third, when the illness has been prolonged, malevolent qi is pervasive and righteous qi has diminished; one should focus on supplementation. </p>
<p>This accumulation of illness represents a principle that builds up day by day, not something that can be resolved overnight; thus, the removal must also be gradual.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>If one is too urgent, it harms the vital energy; if the vital energy is harmed, it cannot transform, and the evil spirits will persist. I have once formulated a remedy consisting of Yin and Yang accumulations, with slightly potent ingredients. When used in moderation, it replenishes for several days, then attacks; regardless of how much is removed, it is supplemented again. When the spirit is strong, then I attack again, repeatedly attacking and supplementing, aiming for balance. This is my unique method, always effective. The classics say: &quot;A great accumulation and a great gathering can be violated, only diminish it by half.&quot; Therefore, by removing half of the accumulation, using pure, sweet, and warm nourishment to strengthen the spleen and earth, the residual accumulation will dissolve without force. If one insists on attacking without leaving any, the chances of causing death and calamity are few. The classics state: &quot;Those who are strong have their energy flow smoothly and recover; the weak, when affected, become ill.&quot; The ancients said: &quot;A strong person has no accumulation, while the weak may possess it; hence, one should nurture the upright to eliminate the evil.&quot; It is like a table full of gentlemen; no space will be available for one or two scoundrels.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Although this is merely the perspective of the inexperienced, if there is a significant accumulation and gathering, one should not merely search and chase after it. Daily application of supplements without understanding will not be beneficial. By carefully discerning what causes the illness and what contributes to the accumulation, once identified accurately, deploy the appropriate methods to address it—what concern would there be that it cannot be cured? The art of war states: a good attacker leaves the enemy unaware of their defenses; this is also akin to being a good strategist in medicine!</p>
<p>For strong pulses indicating a robust health, and weak ones indicating impending death. A pulse that is thin and deeply attached to the bones signifies an accumulation. A deep but strong pulse indicates a mass. A pulse that is deep and tight points to a cold accumulation. Conversely, a floating but firm pulse indicates a gathering.</p>
<p>For light accumulations of alcohol, one may use kudzu root, shenchu (a fermentation agent), huanglian (Coptis chinensis), and white cardamom; in more severe cases, one might employ gan sui (liquidambar) and qian niu zi (cowherb seed).</p>
<p>For light gas accumulations, one may consider using mu xiang (saussurea), zhi ke (bitter orange), hou po (magnolia bark), and orange peel; in more severe cases, one might use zhi shi (bitter orange fruit) and qian niu zi.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>For light blood stasis: lacquer, peach kernel, peony, vincetoxicum, red peony, safflower; for severe cases: rhubarb, lizard, leech, pangolin, stone of flower bud.<br>For light phlegm accumulation: pinellia, (certain herb), for severe cases: phlegm pill. Old phlegm: sea stone, tile root. Phlegm in the skin and outer membranes: white mustard.<br>For light fluid retention: Wuling powder; for severe cases: zhuling, guansui, yanhua.<br>For light tea accumulation: turmeric, sesame; for severe cases: evodia, ginger.<br>For light food stagnation: trisacanthus, atriplex; for severe cases: ba shuang, rhubarb.<br>For light grain accumulation: malt, grain sprouts, shenqu, sand fruit; for severe cases: chicken inner gold.<br>For light meat accumulation: hawthorn, ferula; for severe cases: ningsha, nitrate.<br>For egg accumulation: white cardamom, tangerine peel, fermented soybeans, ginger juice.<br>For vegetable accumulation: clove, cinnamon, musk.<br>For flatulence: radish seeds, ginger wine decoction.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Fish and turtle accumulation can be treated with perilla leaves, orange peel, wood incense, and ginger juice. Turtle accumulation is treated with white horse urine. Dog meat accumulation can be treated with almonds and hawthorn.</p>
<p>Insect accumulation is treated with realgar, tin ash, areca nut, thunderbolt pills, wild yam, nut pine, and the Sage gentleman. Malaria accumulation is treated with turtle shell and grass fruit.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Diseases of accumulation result from food, blood, Qi, wind, and cold. However, the terms &quot;accumulation&quot; and &quot;gathering&quot; need to be distinguished. Accumulation refers to what has built up gradually over time. Gathering refers to what collects and disperses intermittently. An accumulation is solid and unchanging; thus, it is termed &quot;accumulation&quot; (积) because it has form. In contrast, what gathers and disperses, lacking a fixed form, is called &quot;gathering&quot; (聚). </p>
<p>All tangible conditions may arise from either obstruction in food and drink or the retention of pus and blood—when fluids congeal, they lead to symptomatic masses, all categorized as accumulations, primarily affecting the blood, which is tangible and static. </p>
<p>Conversely, intangible conditions, whether distended or not, painful or not, arising sporadically and transiently, classify as gatherings—a category primarily concerning Qi, which is intangible and dynamic. Hence, the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; designates accumulation as yin Qi and gathering as yang Qi, which expresses this very meaning. </p>
<p>Therefore, for any intangible gathering, dispersal is easy; for tangible accumulations, dissolution is challenging. When diagnosing these conditions, one should distinguish between the tangible and intangible, whether related to Qi or blood, and the treatment for accumulation and gathering will naturally become clearer.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The accumulation from food and drink, when it momentarily accumulates, is merely due to dietary injuries, which must occur within the intestines and stomach; thus, it can be expelled or alleviated, making treatment not difficult. However, if one&#39;s eating habits lack moderation, leading to gradual retention, there may be a feeling of fullness in the left side of the diaphragm, because of the stomach&#39;s extensive connections known as &quot;empty within,&quot; which emerges beneath the left breast and is responsive to clothing; this is the pathway of the Yangming Qi. If one experiences irregular hunger and fullness, with food being consumed successively, this can cause the Yangming stomach Qi to become disturbed. If it encounters cold Yin energy, the spleen is unable to transform it, resulting in lingering accumulation that combines with the fluids outside the intestines, clumping together and becoming difficult to disperse, eventually forming a condition of accumulation. Initially, this is very slight and many people do not notice it; as it persists, it takes root and becomes firmly established, making medicinal treatment difficult. Currently, many children in the northwest suffer from this condition, especially in regions where wheat is a staple; this is precisely because wheat is prone to stagnation, leaving disease beneath the skin and membranes, making it hard to treat. Similarly, women who experience blood disorders and Qi stagnation, whether above or below, often have issues outside the intestines and stomach, between the sources of the innate essence; therefore, one should gradually seek methods to dissolve it. Care must be taken not to act recklessly in haste, as doing so may hurt the stomach Qi, causing the accumulation to remain, which would only hasten the danger. Additionally, external influences of wind and cold can also lead to accumulation.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>As the classic text states: The empty evil is within, lingering and not departing, residing outside the intestines and stomach, gathering between the origins, remaining within the meridians, breathing and forming accumulations. It also says: The illness is named &quot;hidden beam,&quot; and this is the root of the wind. From this perspective, we see that people nowadays who develop a mass after contracting malaria, this is indeed related to the wind and cold, and can be inferred. However, while malaria is clearly related to wind and cold, the accumulations due to wind seem unrelated. It is unknown that the stagnation of food does not necessarily lead to accumulation just due to cold, and the evil of wind and cold does not necessarily take shape without food. Therefore, it is essential for food to encounter cold, and for cold to encounter food, otherwise, when the superficial evil has not been cleared, excessive food intake will hinder it, leading to accumulation. The text states: The empty evil wind interacts with the body&#39;s form, and the two vacuities come together, thus lodging in the form. Truly, the origin of accumulation is often due to this. Even blood symptoms and qi stagnation arise from this. However, when accumulations are retained by cold, if retained for long, cold often turns to heat; when wind causes accumulation, and the accumulation forms, it is no longer wind-related. Thus, those treating this should only focus on the area where it is retained, and must not disperse it, so as not to further injure the vital energy. Only careful patients can understand the origin and reflect on it at the onset; then they can formulate effective strategies to preserve the spleen.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>The accumulation of symptoms can manifest anywhere, whether above or below, left or right, as there is no fixed location. Generally, blood accumulates more in the lower parts, while qi and food accumulations are situated above the stomach and below in the lower abdomen. Any stagnation can potentially settle anywhere. I once treated a patient with food-related pain located at the lower right corner of the abdomen. Since then, I have frequently encountered this condition, realizing that the pathway for food must pass from the lower right abdomen into the large intestine, a fact not widely known. </p>
<p>There are also methods for treating food stagnation, as indicated by pain in the abdominal area, which can be verified. Therefore, in treating accumulations, it is essential to carefully examine the causes to ensure accuracy. I have seen Danxi&#39;s discussions state that a lump in the middle indicates phlegm and fluids, on the right indicates food accumulation, and on the left indicates blood clots. If something cannot be formed into a lump, whether gathered or scattered, it is certainly qi. A lump is a tangible entity, formed from the combination of phlegm, food accumulation, and stagnant blood. I believe that what can both gather and disperse is undoubtedly qi accumulation.</p>
<p>If we take the left as blood accumulation and the right as food accumulation, we would be mistaken. For instance, children often suffer from accumulations that are consistently found beneath the left rib, which is merely due to overeating. Thus, would it be correct to assume that just because it is on the left, it must be blood accumulation? If we claim the left side denotes blood and the right side denotes food, could it be that the right side has no blood and the left side has no food? This should not be established as a principle.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p>
<h3>Discourse on Governance</h3>
<p>The classics say: what is solid must be worn away, what is preserved must be attacked, what is bound must be loosened, what is external must be removed. Things above must reach those below, things must be rubbed and bathed, things must be thinned and robbed, things must be opened and developed, appropriate methods being used for the occasion. All methods for managing accumulation, as mentioned in the classics, have already been exhausted. However, to summarize its essentials, there are merely four methods: to attack, to dissolve, to scatter, and to replenish; these four are sufficient. They are detailed as follows: </p>
<p>Considering all solid and concentrated energies, they cannot be eliminated without attack. For example, the secret formulas such as the Dissolving Pill, Iron Elixir, Immortal Pill, Resonance Pill, Large Salt Pill, Three Flower Blessing Pill, Red Gold Bean, and Hundred Obedience Pill are all potent attacking agents. Additionally, forms like the Triangle Pill, Winning Red Pill, Asafoetida Pill, Vitality Pill, Red Little Pill, and Warm White Pill are all lesser attacking agents.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>In cases where conditions cannot withstand aggression, it is best to gradually dissipate and磨 those that are stagnant, such as He Zhong pills, Cardamom pills, Baohe pills, and various types of He Zhong drinks. If there is a buildup that does not recede and the vital energy is not depleted, one should use agents that promote the flow of qi and relieve stagnation to dissolve and subtly eliminate it. For intangible qi accumulation, it is advisable to disperse and heal it with formulas like the Air Dispelling Drink, Aromatic Spirit Powder, Zhi Mi Qi Decoction, Ten Aromatic Pills, and Four Grind Drinks.</p>
<p>In cases where the accumulation of qi is mild and both aggressive and supportive treatments are not suitable, one should primarily focus on regulating the spleen and stomach. For example, the Jie Gu Zhi Zhi Pill is appropriate. Additionally, I have further developed this formula and recently created a Peony and Zhi Zhi Pill, which addresses both liver and spleen to reduce swelling, eliminate accumulation, relieve abdominal pain, and improve appetite, proving to be more effective than the former.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>For example, the Great Strengthening Spleen Pill, Wood Fragrance Ginseng and Ginger Pill, and other similar formulas, are all excellent remedies for tonifying the spleen and stomach, which should be chosen for use. </p>
<p>Generally, individuals with deficiency in the spleen and kidneys, and those who are weak and imbalanced, often suffer from conditions of accumulation. When the spleen is weak, the middle burner fails to function; when the kidneys are weak, the lower burner cannot process. When the vital energy does not circulate, pathogens can establish themselves. For such individuals, regardless of whether the issues are tangible or intangible, one should assess the urgency and always prioritize vital energy as the main focus.</p>
<p>For deficiencies in the spleen and stomach, it is advisable to use formulas such as Five-Flavored Differentiation Powder, Nourishing the Center Decoction, Warm Stomach Drink, or Return to Spleen Decoction. For deficiencies in the liver and kidneys, formulas like Nourishing Yin Decoction, Kidney Qi Pill, or Warming the Liver Decoction should be used appropriately; this is known as nourishing the righteous and allowing accumulation to eliminate itself. If there is stagnation present within a deficiency, it is permissible to add some adjunctive ingredients.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The key to treating accumulation lies in understanding when to attack and when to supplement, and one should discern the urgency of each situation. If the accumulation has not persisted long and the vital energy remains intact, treatment should not be delayed; for if it is delayed, it will only strengthen its hold, making it harder to control, hence this situation requires swift action. Conversely, if the accumulation has lasted for a longer period and the vital energy is gradually depleting, attempting to attack it now will be ineffective, as the accumulated energy is too distant to reach, while the vital energy is close at hand and can easily be harmed. The more one attacks, the more depleted it becomes, leading not to death from accumulation but from the attack itself. This highlights the importance of preserving life rather than focusing solely on the illness, which must be recognized. Therefore, when dealing with weakness due to evils, one should adopt a gentle approach, focusing on strengthening the spleen and stomach to fortify the foundation, using moxibustion or plasters to clear the channels. As long as the primary energy becomes stronger and the channel energy flows freely, the accumulated distention will dissipate. The balance of urgency and delay is the overall strategy. This principle applies not just to accumulation but to all illnesses.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>In cases of hard masses, these must be located outside the intestines, specifically between the organs, and their resolution cannot be achieved solely through medicinal power. Therefore, it is advisable to use substances like Ferula gum resin, amber ointment, or the safflower ointment and Three Sacred ointment to attack externally, while employing the technique of the Chang Sang Jun needle to address the internal issue. Yet, such stubborn accumulations will ultimately be difficult to dissipate without the application of fire; hence, moxibustion is most effective. I have treated several patients in the capital who had hard masses in the left flank, all successfully using moxibustion. </p>
<p>Long-standing accumulations lead to sores due to stagnation in the meridians, which can lead to the activation of the liver, spleen, and stomach fire, causing symptoms like facial swelling, mouth ulcers, and foul-smelling gums. Therefore, externally one should use medicated plasters or moxibustion to break apart the stubborn masses, while internally one should use pills containing aloe and similar ingredients to clear the heat from the sores.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescriptions of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method for Hard Masses</strong></p>
<p>When a disease presents as a hard mass that does not easily disperse, one should use softening treatments. For instance, when a lump forms in the chest or there is accumulation in the abdomen, the method is to employ medicine to soften it. If a lump forms in the heart, this is due to the stagnation of qi and blood; thus, one should use tonics for qi and blood, adding a slight amount of ingredients to soften hard masses, allowing the qi and blood to flow, which will cause the hard mass to dissipate on its own. If one merely attacks the mass without understanding the role of warming and nourishing medicines, the hardness will ultimately persist. </p>
<p>The prescription includes: one qian each of ginseng, Angelica, blue salt, five-flavor herb, bupleurum, and pinellia; three qian each of white peony and ophiopogon; five qian of cooked Rehmannia; two qian of cornelian cherry; one piece of aconite, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is excellent for its pure use of tonics, adding only blue salt to soften hard masses. If one is not focused on treating hardness, over time it will naturally soften; this is the subtle method of yielding overcoming rigidity.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The firmness of stubborn masses requires another method for treatment. The hardness lies within the abdomen; if one merely attacks the firmness, it will surely lead to disharmony in the abdomen, damaging the stomach&#39;s vital energy. Therefore, the approach should be to soften and harmonize within to treat it, allowing the nature of the hardness to ease, its form to transform, its energy to dissipate, and its blood to be consumed. Otherwise, tangible substances will take root within, while intangible energies will be exhausted externally, and over time, the firmness will remain despite efforts to eliminate it.</p>
<p>The formula includes five liang of white atractylodes, two liang of malt, eight liang of buckwheat flour, and one jin of turtle shell, along with three liang each of vinegar-dried white peony and poria, one liang each of pinellia, licorice, and white mustard seed, five qian each of radish seed, magnolia bark, and ginseng, along with three qian of cinnamon and one qian of aconite, all ground into powder, then formed into pills with honey. Take five qian before sleep each day, and with these fine medicines, there has never been a case of incomplete recovery.</p>
<p>This formula possesses remarkable efficacy, especially utilizing turtle shell as the main ingredient, which penetrates all hardness. Notably, the addition of buckwheat flour complements turtle shell to combat evils without exhausting vital energy. The other ingredients are all medicines that strengthen the spleen and regulate internal order, enabling the spleen to become robust and materials to naturally transform. The use of cinnamon and aconite as offensive reinforcements is particularly brilliant, allowing the turtle shell&#39;s forces to advance relentlessly. It symbolizes a benevolent leader; even if the enemy is strong, they would not dare to resist, scattering in fear. Additional forces follow behind, decisively eliminating without leaving a trace, integrating both suppression and pacification—who could fail to achieve victory in less than three months? This is the true excellence of softer treatment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>If the vital energy is not replenished and one only relies on Da Huang (rhubarb), Ba Dou (croton), and substances like Ai Wei (ferula), while vigorously attacking the disease, there may be temporary victories. However, the central plains will be ravaged, the fields desolate, and ultimately the granaries will be empty and the people will suffer from scarcity for years without recovery. </p>
<p>When someone shows signs of a lump or mass, with sudden onset and abdominal pain that cannot be touched, one can use purgative methods to expel the disorder. The formula includes one tael of bitter orange, two taels of white atractylodes, and five qian of burnt horse dung, brewed with wine for consumption. Horse dung is particularly effective at soothing pain without damaging the vital energy, and it also helps expel pathogens and transform stagnant matter, thus it is most suitable to keep it readily available in the medicine cabinet, as it cannot always be obtained in an emergency. This substance becomes more effective with age; there is no need to use it in large quantities—just one or two qian will yield marvelous results. </p>
<p>In this case, using five qian together with bitter orange will help dissolve the accumulated mass. However, merely dissolving the mass may hurt the spleen&#39;s yin, so adding two taels of white atractylodes will greatly strengthen the spleen&#39;s energy. Therefore, horse dung and bitter orange can work effectively to expel and disperse the condition; this is indeed a wonderful method.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p>For accumulated fruit causing spleen injury and urgent bloating: use one qian of musk and one liang of ground cinnamon. Mix with rice to form pills the size of mung beans; adults take fifteen pills, children take seven, to be taken with warm water. This is because when fruit encounters musk, it falls, and wood encounters cinnamon, it withers.</p>
<p>For accumulated blockages that do not disperse: use five liang of turtle plastron roasted in wine, one and a half liang of roasted cypress leaves, and two liang of ground cyperus steeped and roasted into a powder. Form into pills the size of walnuts, taking a hundred with warm wine when hungry.</p>

</li>
<li><p>For painful lumps in the heart: Mix two qian of silkworm powder with white horse urine, ingest, and apply on the lump.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If one mistakenly eats the essence of a snake in vegetables, resulting in snake phlegm, or eats snake meat leading to phlegm, causing constant hunger and vomiting of food: Use one red-footed centipede, roast, grind to powder, and take with wine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Country folk who enjoy gnawing lice find that they breed in the abdomen, leading to lice symptoms: Use a ruined comb and a broken hair comb, each broken into two pieces; burn one piece and grind it, use the other with five sheng of water, boil to yield one sheng, and take it to induce a discharge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For blood accumulations forming lumps: One gecko, wrapped in duck skin and ground to make a cake, cooked and eaten will dispel the blood lumps, typically in three to five times — remarkably effective.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For heart and abdominal phlegm masses, and chronic symptoms: Use the droppings of a white cock fed with rice, mix it with urine in a ceramic vessel, boil down to a yellow powder; take the size of a grain of rice with warm wine, four to five times a day, or mix with rice for better absorption. This method is also good.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>For the formation of lumps from eating rice, one can consume raw rice; when chewed, it releases clear water. Take equal parts of chicken droppings and white rice, fry them together into a powder, mix with one cup of water and consume it. After a long while, if one expels something resembling rice, one is cured. In the past, Shen Gongdao suffered from this ailment, with his body emaciated, but a monk from Shu provided this remedy, leading to his recovery. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For accumulated phlegm in the abdomen: take one pound of yellow beef and three qian of Hengshan, boil them together until cooked, eat the meat and drink the juice; the phlegm must surely dissipate, with significant effectiveness. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For spleen accumulation and phlegm, the cow brain pill is effective for both men and women suffering from spleen accumulation diseases. Take one cow brain, remove the sinews and pound it to a pulp. Mix with one pound of natron and six steamed cakes, sun-dry and grind until uniform, then form into pills the size of walnuts. Take twenty pills with good wine on an empty stomach, three times a day, and there will be results in a hundred days.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For phlegm accumulation forming lumps, use one cow brain, remove the sinews, and one male chicken gizzard (with yolk). Soak in good wine overnight, then pound into a paste.

Mix in three qian of light powder. Take two qian each time, with strong wine on an empty stomach, three times a day.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states: For breathlessness accompanied by spitting blood, the point &quot;Ju Que&quot; is the main treatment. For abdominal accumulation moving upwards and downwards, use &quot;Xuan Shu.&quot; </p>
<p>For acute pain in the heart and abdomen, as well as hernia-like symptoms, use &quot;Yun Men.&quot; For a hardened mass below the heart, the points &quot;Huang Yu,&quot; &quot;Qi Men,&quot; and &quot;Zhong Wan&quot; are indicated. </p>
<p>If there&#39;s a firm mass in the upper abdomen (resembling a moon), accompanied by pain radiating to the genitals and difficulty urinating, the points &quot;Yin Jiao&quot; are recommended. For pain that wraps around the navel, &quot;Shi Men&quot; is the main point. </p>
<p>When the upward movement of &quot;Ben Tun&quot; causes abdominal pain (resembling a moon) that is severe, preventing speech, with swelling leading first to the waist and then to the lower abdomen, accompanied by firm and painful waist regions, radiating downwards, causing difficulty urinating, as well as testicular pain, &quot;Shi Men&quot; should be used.</p>
<p>If &quot;Ben Tun&quot; causes a cold sensation in the lower abdomen, with occasional nausea, blood in the urine, frequent urination, back pain radiating to the genitals, a feeling of urgency in the abdomen, chronic diarrhea, use &quot;Guan Yuan.&quot; For &quot;Ben Tun&quot; affecting the heart, resulting in severe breathlessness, sudden weak breathing, and a feeling of faintness, with heart discomfort and loss of appetite, and if there’s a feeling of fullness with pain in the abdomen, causing violent discomfort in the lower abdomen and spine, use &quot;Zhong Ji.&quot; </p>
<p>For abdominal accumulation that causes intermittent illness, &quot;Shang Qu&quot; should be prioritized.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>Accumulation of hernia and hardness below the navel, with blood in the womb, is governed by Sijia. A hernia around the navel causes pain and, at times, rushes upward to the heart; Tianshu governs this. Qi hernia leads to belching and vomiting, with facial swelling and a tendency for a sinking feeling; Tianshu governs this.</p>
<p>The running piglet (bendun) rises to the ovaries, causing pain radiating to the genitalia; Guizhong governs this. The running piglet above and below is governed by Qimen. Hernia and hardness cause acute pain in the hip, radiating up and down the sides, with sharp abdominal pain and accumulation; Fushi governs this. Running piglet causes abdominal swelling; Zhangmen governs this.</p>
<p>Accumulation in the lower abdomen is governed by Laogong. Zhongwan governs abdominal distension and obstruction, worry and overthinking have caused damage, with Qi accumulating and severe abdominal pain leading to pus and abscesses, fluctuating up and down. Generally, if there is heat in the abdomen, with thirst and saliva production, it suggests tapeworm; press it with the hand persistently, ensuring it does not shift, then use a large needle to puncture Zhongwan and hold for a long time, if it does not move, then withdraw the needle. </p>
<p>The &quot;Effective Method&quot; states: when running piglet presents as upper Qi stagnation with heart pain that feels unbearable, urgently soak hands and feet in warm water, repeatedly changing, then moxibustion on Qihai, Guanyuan, Qimen, and Zhangmen each with a hundred strikes, and fifty strikes at Zhongji. For masses and hardness, moxibustion on the back of the ankles continuously year by year; also moxibustion on Qihai with a hundred strikes, and two hundred strikes at Zhongwan.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: For symptoms of masses and accumulations, first needle the site of the mass; if severe, also needle at the head and tail of the mass, and it will respond immediately; after needling, apply moxibustion. Additionally, perform moxibustion on the Three Mile point. For accumulations, use the Middle Cavity, Suspended Pivot, Spleen Back, and Commercial Qu, and tonify; also the Cubit Marsh and Great Stream. For masses, use the Chapter Gate, Middle Cavity, Sea of Qi, Heavenly Pivot, Upper Cavity, and Communicating Valley. The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: For distension masses, measure the size of the patient&#39;s big toe with a rice stalk, extend the measurement to the heel, then measure from the tip of the tailbone to the end of the stalk, opening a chive leaf width on each side. Apply moxibustion on the left side if the left is affected, and on the right side for the right. Needle three times, apply moxibustion seven times, and the results will be miraculous. Another method: at the bifurcation point of the second toe, apply moxibustion five to seven times; if the left side is affected, moxibustion on the right, and vice versa. After moxibustion, if one feels movement in the abdomen that evening, it is a verification. The &quot;Subtle Meanings of the Jade Machine&quot; states: In general, when moxibusting for distension, one must moxibustion at the root of the distension; there is no case where it will not be effective.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>The method lies below the thirteen vertebrae of the spine, at the center of the spine, marked with ink. This is not an acupuncture point; however, on both sides of the ink mark, open three and a half inches, and by feeling with the fingers, if a slight pulse is discerned, then needle and cauterize at the point. The acupuncture point is approximately level with the navel, with more emphasis on the left side, or sometimes applying to both sides. This is the root of the distension. If the left side is affected, cauterize the right; if the right side is affected, cauterize the left, and it will also be effective.</p>
<p>The cauterization points: Zhongwan, Qimen, Zhangmen, Pishu, Sanjiao, and Tonggu are the points suitable for cauterization for various forms of distension. For accumulations above, it is advisable to cauterize the upper stomach, middle stomach, Qimen, and Zhangmen. For masses below, it is advisable to cauterize Tianshu, Zhangmen, Shenshu, Qihai, Guanyuan, Zhongji, and Shuidao. In all cauterization methods, it is preferable to treat from above to below. The cauterization on the navel and abdomen should be slightly more vigorous; all should first be cauterized seven to fourteen times, gradually increasing thereafter, becoming more effective with greater intensity.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The acupuncture points mentioned above can all treat bloating, so one should select and use them accordingly. However, there are cases where certain points should not be pressed, such as in the most hardened areas of bloating, whether at the head or tail, or areas that bulge or move. Instead, it is necessary to observe the channels and their origins, and one should press on the respective areas and apply moxibustion. Where the fire reaches, the hardened energy will naturally begin to disperse gradually, showcasing the miraculous effects of transformation. However, the method for moxibustion of bloating does not yield results from a single application; one must diligently select from various points and, through repeated applications—two or three times in succession—one will inevitably find relief. </p>
<p>For pain around the navel, with painful contraction of both testicles making it difficult to lie down, Tai Chong (Liver 3) governs this condition. </p>
<p>In cases of cold hernia descending to the abdomen, causing knee and waist pain like clear water, with a distended lower abdomen (some say the small abdomen), pressing up to the knee, Fu Tu (Bladder 30) governs this condition.</p>
<p>For cold hernia pain with abdominal bloating, weakness, and shortness of breath, Yin Shi (Spleen 6) governs this condition. </p>
<p>For a large hernia with a hardened abdomen, Qiu Xu (Spleen 8) governs this condition.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>Inside the abdomen, there are large hernias and accumulations, which cause pain in conjunction with the yin, surging and leaking above and below. Therefore, supplement points like Shizhe, Taixi, and the cun口 of the Hand Yangming should all be fortified. The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; states: the Qi Sea governs hernias of the lower abdomen, traversing the five organs and causing sharp abdominal pain. The points Geyu and Yinggu govern abdominal bloating, severe pain in the stomach area, as well as muscular pain. Gaoqu governs abdominal accumulations that cause intermittent sharp pain. [Also known as Shangqu.] Si Man governs sharp pain on the sides of the abdomen. Abdominal knotting is characterized by severe pain around the navel. Chongmen governs cold sensations filling the abdomen, causing accumulation and intense pain. Zhongji governs accumulations in the lower abdomen that feel as hard as stone, leading to a fullness in that area. Tonggu governs the retention of fluids, resulting in mass formations, fullness in the chest, and difficulty in digestion. Bladder shu governs hard knots and accumulations.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Guided Movement</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states: for the method of guiding away lumpiness, stretch the left hand forward and up, and the right hand back and down, holding the breath in one mouthful. Shift your body and turn your neck, alternating left and right, each for seventy turns. Wait until you faintly feel a sound inside, and your body feels warm, then stop, while also performing the posterior exercises. Focus energy at the navel, directing it to disperse the affected area, or imagine cutting through the energy lump with a knife, pushing it to the four sides, or using fiery methods to burn it away.<br>When there is blood accumulation, visualize divine fire descending to the chest and diaphragm area, where pain from parasites occurs, envisioning small circles expanding to larger ones. Over time, you will feel internal heat; the parasites cannot remain. Intend to split the energy apart, dispersing it to the back and down to the large intestine. Then use water from the soles of your feet, moving from the ribs to the shins, and washing up to the lower back. Subsequently, send it through the large intestine, allowing it to exit with the stool, eliminating the parasites.<br>For congested blood, at the painful area, visualize burning it with fire, washing it with water, and then envision a hole at the painful spot for the stagnant energy to exit.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Records of the Historian,&quot; it is said in the account of Cang Gong: Qi&#39;s junior official Pan Manru suffered from pain in the lower abdomen. I assessed his pulse and said it was a case of retained accumulation. I then told Qi&#39;s Grand Official, Minister Rao, and the physician Yao that if the junior official does not cease his activities, he will die within thirty days. After more than twenty days, he passed away from blood in his urine, a condition worsened by drinking alcohol. Thus, I discerned that Pan Manru&#39;s illness stemmed from my careful pulse diagnosis: it was deep, small, and weak, indicating a sudden change in spleen qi. The pulse in the right side was tight and small, revealing stagnation in qi. Due to this combination, he was destined to die in thirty days. When all three yin channels are involved, it follows a certain pattern. If they are not all involved, the urgency of the condition dictates the outcome; when one channel is involved, the proximity to danger increases. Therefore, when all three yin channels are engaged, blood in the urine continues as before.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>In times of distress, a woman&#39;s illness was severe. Many physicians believed it to be a serious case of cold and heat, thinking she would die and chose not to treat her. I examined her pulse and diagnosed her with tapeworm disease, which causes abdominal swelling and yellowing of the skin, accompanied by a feeling of unease. I suggested a small dose of candied herb, and a few liters of tapeworms were expelled; her illness was cured. After thirty days, she remained well. This tapeworm was caused by cold and dampness; the energy of cold and dampness remained stagnant and transformed into worms. I discerned the cold was affecting her health by examining her pulse—her pulse was thick and her hair vibrant, indicating the presence of worm energy. The color and luster indicated no harmful or serious illness within.</p>
<p>The &quot;Records of the Search for Spirits&quot; says: In ancient times, a man and his servant both suffered from abdominal tumours, and neither could be cured. After the servant died, they cut him open and found a white turtle with very bright red eyes. They tested it with various toxic drugs, pouring them into its mouth, but it showed no signs of damage. They then tied the turtle to the foot of the bed. Suddenly, a guest came to visit, riding a white horse, and the horse urinated, splashing the turtle. The turtle, frightened, tried to flee but could not due to being tied up, and it withdrew its organs, neck, and feet in panic. The sick man observed this and said to his son: “My illness can be cured now.” He then took the white horse&#39;s urine and poured it over the turtle, and shortly thereafter, it dissolved, producing several liters of liquid. The sick man then drank the remaining urine, and his illness was completely alleviated.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>Taiwei Xi Jian, styled Daohui, was stationed in Dantu. He once went hunting in mid-February when the ferns began to sprout. One of his soldiers broke a stem and immediately felt a subtle nausea, so he returned home and developed severe abdominal pain. After about half a year, he suddenly vomited and expelled a red snake over a foot long, which was still moving. He hung it up under the eaves, and gradually, its juices dripped out, causing it to dry up and shrink. After one night, upon inspecting it, it turned out to be a stem of fern, the same as what he had eaten before. His illness was thus cured.</p>
<p>During the reign of Huan Xuanwu, there was a commanding officer who, after suffering from a prevailing illness, experienced虚热 (virtual heat) and became able to drink tea again. He would drink one to two measures to feel full, and even then felt it was insufficient—he would have to drink for more than one day. Poor in resources, a guest later visited him and happened to witness his tea-drinking. Having heard of such an illness, he ordered an additional five liters of tea for him. The officer then vomited up a substance that was the size of a liter, which had an orifice and was crumpled, resembling a cow&#39;s stomach. The guest instructed to place it in a basin and poured one to two measures of tea over it. Everything dissolved, yet he only felt a slight distension; adding another five liters caused it to surge forth completely from his mouth. Once he expelled that substance, his illness was cured. When asked about the ailment, he answered, &quot;This is known as &#39;a liter of mass.&#39;&quot;<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>In the &quot;Yiyuan&quot; it is said: During the Yuanjia period, there was a person in Zhang&#39;an who ate duck meat and then developed a disease of swelling, his chest felt full, and his face was red, unable to eat or drink. The doctor prescribed a drink made from glutinous rice, and shortly thereafter he felt discomfort and vomited a duckling, fully formed with body, bill, and wings, but for its left foot was still attached the meat he had previously eaten. The illness was then cured.</p>
<p>There was a person who accidentally swallowed hair and became ill, wanting only to swallow pig fat. When he opened his mouth, he saw something protruding from his throat and it received the fat. He then took a small hook as bait and pulled out something over three feet long, which resembled a snake but was entirely pig fat. He hung it in the room, and in ten days, it completely melted away, leaving only the hair.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Path to Filial Piety,&quot; it is mentioned: The monk Ying Gong from the Xianqing Temple had a condition that lasted for several years, where he could not lie down with his head on a pillow. Every time after the fourth watch, he felt a hard sensation in his chest, unable to rest, and had to walk around the temple. It became a habit, and no one knew what illness it was. He sought medicine from Dai Ren. Dai Ren instructed him to expel one or two liters of viscous saliva, resembling black alum water, then yellow-green fluid followed, and then several liters of pus and blood. After that, it felt as if a great mountain had been lifted from his chest, allowing him to drink and eat without measure, and he slept peacefully until dawn.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>The station chief of Xi City heard that his father had died at the hands of bandits, and he was deeply saddened. After he finished weeping, he felt a pain in his heart that only intensified. For over a month, it formed into a lump shaped like an overturned cup, causing relentless pain, and no medicine was effective. It was suggested to use fire needles and mugwort, but the patient disliked this and sought help from a healer. When the healer arrived, a shaman was present, who began to speak nonsense like a madman and mocked the sick person. The sick person found this so amusing that he turned to face the wall. Within a day or two, the lump in his heart dissipated. The healer said: &quot;The Inner Canon states that worry causes qi to congeal, while joy allows all vessels to flow harmoniously. It also says that joy triumphs over sadness. The Inner Canon has its own methods; if the healer does not know this, then why use needles and moxibustion, which only exacerbates the pain?&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, the wife of Liu Ziping had a lump in her abdomen for eighteen years, her menstrual flow having ceased, and no treatments had worked. The healer instructed that within a month, there should be four occurrences of expulsions, followed by six eliminations, resulting in approximately one or two buckets of phlegm eliminated. Among the substances expelled were things resembling decayed vegetables and fish entrails. During the expulsions, wooden tools were used to guide the process, and the patient felt the accumulated sickness scraping away, gradually becoming smoother. Once the accumulation was gone, the indentation where the lump had been was like a mortar, showing no signs of damage. At this point, her complexion had a youthful hue, and her menstrual flow resumed, as if she were once again young enough to conceive.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>In the summer of Yang, the wife of the chief clerk Zhang was afflicted by a disease characterized by phlegm and heat, initially the size of a wine cup and accompanied by chills and fever. After more than fifteen years, due to her temperament being quick and prone to sadness, her condition worsened. Only about three fingers&#39; width below her heart felt normal, while her abdomen felt as hard as stone, making it impossible for her to sit or lie down. She had tried acupuncture repeatedly but to no avail, so she respectfully invited a person named Dai to inquire about her condition. Upon his arrival, he diagnosed it as phlegm and heat. He said it was acquired in late summer on a particular day, located under her left ribs, resembling an overturned cup, and it had persisted for a long time, causing her to experience chills and fever. Phlegm heat manifests as chills and fever.</p>
<p>He used a formula to expel the phlegm and she vomited out a substantial quantity of fishy yellow phlegm, about one to two pints. At night, he continued with another remedy, which caused her to expel a mixture of yellow phlegm and pus in about five or six instances, feeling pain wherever there was accumulation. Later, he used white atractylodes powder and angelica powder to harmonize the blood and facilitate her menstrual flow. After such purging sessions, which occurred three to four times, she finally recovered.</p>
<p>In the county of Xihua, Mr. Yan, a scholar from Mount Shang, had been suffering from accumulations for twenty years. His vision was impaired, unable to see small characters, and he felt as if his heart was a hard stone. Every time he experienced pain, it was unbearable, and his appetite waned, with his face appearing dark and his waist unable to straighten. Dai instructed him to expel a large amount of cold phlegm, roughly equivalent in volume to powdered stone, while at night he used another remedy to treat him with a mix of herbal pastes and fish innards, resulting in several expulsions. After his ailments decreased by three to four parts out of ten, he was given a warm porridge to help expel phlegm, which amounted to an entire basin. The next day, he continued the treatment, and over about a hundred instances in total, he faced little difficulty. Within five to six days, his dark complexion lightened, his appetite improved, his vision sharpened, and he felt a sense of emptiness in his heart, thus losing the sensation of the hard stone that had troubled him.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>A skilled bowmaker had a daughter-in-law, thirty years old, who was already seven months pregnant. Whenever she experienced pain, she summoned a maid to attend to her, believing she was about to give birth. This occurred several times over the course of a couple of days. Eventually, they consulted a diagnostician, who examined her pulse and found it thin and weak, concluding that it was a condition of an obstructed mass rather than a pregnancy. According to the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; a weak pulse resembles the scraping of bamboo and indicates that a man has injured his vital essence and a woman has stagnant blood. The treatment for such a condition was to purge it. First, over a hundred small pills were prescribed, followed by a decoction of Stomach-Regulating and Qi-Promoting soup with added Angelica and Peach Kernel, boiled with river water and taken hot. After two to three days, more pills and the same decoction were administered, causing a mix of yellow and green pus and blood to be expelled. Each time she changed clothes, she was advised to massage downward with her hands to help discharge it. After another two to three days, more pills were given along with a preparation of pig kidney powder. After another one to two days, further doses of pills and the same soup were taken, and the condition improved significantly. Once the weather cleared and before eating, acupuncture was performed at the San Yin Jiao point to drain it. In less than ten days, the mass had disappeared. How is this different from examining the five organs through the abdomen?<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>In Bianliang, the daughter of Ambassador Cao, having reached marriageable age, had suffered from a blood tumor for several years.

<p>A youth from Wangting Village entered, walking in a manner that resembled someone bearing a heavy burden. The healer remarked: &quot;This is due to a condition of the spleen.&quot; He instructed the youth to remove his clothing and examined his body; he found two lines resembling arms and sought treatment from the healer. First, he pricked the left side, which responded like piercing thick paper, making a sound as it broke, and directed him to massage it, which immediately eased the tension. The same was done on the right side. Those observing all expressed amazement. Someone inquired, and the healer answered: &quot;It is the stone gate acupoint.&quot;</p>
<p>A certain man, fond of tea to the point of addiction, had an accumulation on his left flank. The healer noted: &quot;This bears similarity to phlegm, but as there are no symptoms of chills and fevers, it is certainly not phlegm.&quot; Although he had been ill for ten years, he hardly labored for a single day. Moreover, his pulse was deep and thin, indicating stagnation. The healer treated him without the pain of needles or moxibustion, but with a little irritation for a short duration, allowing him to enjoy a full lifespan. First, he mixed tea to expel the accumulated tea water, amounting to several liters; then he used water like a wish-granting spoon and expelled several more liters, all turning tea-colored; next, he applied over ninety pills of the Three Flower Divine Aid, purging over twenty flows, with pus and water mixed, drying up phlegm and stagnant blood, all expelled together. The next day, he administered a dampness-expelling remedy, for over ten days, and all ailments were alleviated, leaving the man’s spirit clear and complexion radiant.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>The &quot;Health Treasure Guide&quot; states: The Lord of Zhen Ding, at the age of nineteen, suffered from a buildup condition, with his left navel connected to his side as if covered by a cup, his abdomen swollen like a drum, and showing many green collaterals. He experienced shortness of breath and could not lie down. At that time, it was the hot and rainy season, compounded by frequent diarrhea from consuming fully matured grains; he had tidal heat during the day and night sweats, and he came seeking help in a critical state. When I examined him, his pulse was floating and rapid, yet weak upon pressure. I remarked that for treating buildup, it is inadvisable to use toxic medicines. Given his weak pulse, how could I dare to use conventional methods? Therefore, I prescribed a digestive tonic to promote the stomach, and after several doses, his bowels adjusted naturally; combined with methods to balance yin and yang, and to facilitate digestion and qi flow, his abdominal swelling decreased, and his stomach&#39;s qi began to stabilize. I intermittently provided additional remedies, and within a month, he recovered well. The ancients said: nourishing the righteous allows buildup to dispel itself. For example, if the entire gathering consists of gentlemen, even a single villain cannot find a place to emerge. Now, if genuine qi is abundant and stomach qi is strong, the buildup will dissipate by itself. Can the words of the ancients deceive me? The classics say: great buildup is great accumulation; diminish it by more than half, and then stop. There is buildup qi within fullness; even with highly toxic medicines, one should not overdose, much less when there is buildup in a weak condition. This is also a facet of treating buildup. The interplay of evil and righteousness, fullness and emptiness, should be examined with precision.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Medicine&quot; states: The governor of Xiangyang, as Yu Jianru, when he was in Baixia, experienced abdominal pain after drinking, which gradually became hard and painful with any food intake. I diagnosed that his pulse was floating, large, and long, indicating a significant accumulation in the spleen. However, when pressing both lower sides, they were soft, so it was unwise to apply harsh treatment. I prescribed the Si Jun Zi Decoction for seven days and used a self-made pill for accumulation, three qian, which slightly reduced the condition. Then I prescribed an additional four qian, leading to over ten eliminations, all of which were black and tough. Observing that his shape did not tire, I increased to four qian more, resulting in significant abdominal pain but a substantial expulsion. After ten days of Si Jun Zi Decoction and subsequently four qian of the pills again, he eliminated three times; with an additional two qian, the excrement yielded six to seven bowls worth. The pulse was now large yet weak, and upon pressing the guan area, it was notably open. Thus, I administered the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and nourished him for a month, which resulted in a complete recovery.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>The father-in-law, Wang Hanliang from the Ministry of Works, was enraged and developed a severe illness. His body was rigid and he was in great pain, suffering from continuous diarrhea—over two hundred times in a day and night. Within a month, his physique had wasted away, his spirit was confused, and he could not speak, as his treatment had reached its end, and he was just waiting to die. I diagnosed him, saying: although the symptoms showed no signs of vitality, the pulse still held some life, as the true internal pulse could not be detected. The whole family was delighted, saying: all the doctors declared he was doomed. What method can ensure his recovery? I replied: in the stage of extreme deficiency, the treatment must involve great warmth and supplementation. Thus, I administered a remedy containing alum, dragon bone, millet husk, and the root of the tree, to strengthen his intestines; along with two taels of ginseng and five qian of熟附 (cooked Aconite), to support his vital energy. Within three days, he consumed half a jin of ginseng, and two taels of熟附, and his diarrhea reduced by half, his tongue could move and he could begin to speak. I further supplemented with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding fresh Aconite and dried ginger, with five doses in one day. After a hundred days, his energy surged and he could eat well, with diarrhea reduced by nineteen times. However, every night he still experienced four to five bouts. His legs were debilitated; I prescribed pills made with Xianmao, Bajiao, Ding, and Aconite, and administered Shenfu Decoction. After a total of one hundred forty days, he walked normally, and both the discomfort and diarrhea were completely resolved. If I had listened to the doubts of others, who warned against using too much ginseng and Aconite, how could there have been a Day of Rebirth? I detailed this case as a cautionary account for those who lack faith in specialized medicine.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>A friend of mine, Yao Yuanchang, had long suffered from a mass in his abdomen. Over the course of two years, he had tried every remedy to attack it, but the mass had not completely disappeared, and his body had grown weak and emaciated. Upon hearing of his condition, I told a mutual friend, saying: &quot;The mass is half gone, and it cannot be attacked any further. Instead, use a nourishing decoction. Once his vital energy is restored, the illness will be completely eliminated.&quot; Yuanchang believed me and proceeded to make a nourishing pill. After taking it, the mass completely dissolved.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: Gu Mingzhong has suffered from a stomach ailment for nearly thirty years. It swells in the morning and becomes urgent in the evening; whenever he has a major episode, his abdomen remains distended for over ten days before subsiding. Eating damp foods or overexerting himself seems to exacerbate the issue. There is a subtle, high throb on the left side of his abdomen, which makes a gurgling sound when touched during breathing. Using the &quot;mass and block&quot; method for treatment, focusing on both internal and external remedies, has been unable to cure him. </p>
<p>I acted as an internal observer, first enlightening him before proceeding with treatment. The human body has five accumulations and six gatherings, and the malice affecting the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys can be bound in the abdominal regions on all sides and around the navel, appearing as though covered by a bowl. The malice linked to the gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, and bladder are each situated at their respective locations but are not always visibly distinct. This condition is related to the yin energy of the kidneys, accumulating in the yang pathway of the bladder, resembling a mass or block. </p>
<p>How do we know this? The kidneys have two orifices: the left kidney connects to the bladder at the front, and the right kidney connects to the life gate at the back. When malice settles on the left side of the abdomen, it indicates the left kidney and bladder are primarily affected. Among the six organs, only the gallbladder does not excrete; the five organs receive the turbid energy from the five viscera, which cannot linger long and are thus considered excretory. Now, if the kidney malice transmits to the bladder, the bladder fails in its excretory function. The old malice has not been expelled, and now a new malice has come, inevitably seeping through gradually like a leather pouch enclosing something. The classic text states: &quot;The bladder is the official of the region, where fluids are stored; it is capable of expelling them when transformed.&quot;<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>If the kidney&#39;s essence accumulates without release for a long time, could it not be the bladder&#39;s failure to regulate its transformation? The human abdomen encompasses both the large and small intestines along with the bladder, and the membrane resides within the bladder. As long as waste is not retained for long, there is ample space. Now, if the kidney&#39;s essence does not self-restrain and is wholly directed to the bladder, and the bladder&#39;s essence is stored without discharge, can it maintain order akin to the clarity and spontaneity of the gallbladder? It is only reasonable that swelling occurs, as there is an inherent aspect to it. The classics say: &quot;Those suffering from kidney ailments tend to swell, replacing the heel with the buttocks, and the spine with the head.&quot; If the bladder were capable of managing its discharge, why then such extreme swelling? It is also said: &quot;The great yang draws essence for three days.&quot; The bladder channel of the great yang attracts essence and swelling ceases after three days; this is what defines swelling.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>For several decades, where then lies the power of attraction? The method of treatment: Nourish the kidney water to achieve abundance, so that the essence and energy are deeply stored, resulting in the bladder’s swelling dissipating; nourish the bladder to invigorate the energy, thus preventing the kidney&#39;s anomalies from accumulating, and the processes of transport and transformation become ample. The reason for this is that if the kidney is not nourished, it cannot store; if the bladder is not nourished, it cannot discharge. However, it is easy to nourish the kidney, while it is difficult to nourish the bladder, for most herbal medicines are more about discharging than nourishing. When the bladder is insufficient, it leads to a definite end. Future generations fail to understand the reason; I venture to speculate that the more insufficient the bladder becomes, the more it swells, and extreme swelling will inevitably transmit upwards to the kidney; when the kidney becomes extremely swollen, it will inevitably transmit to the small intestine; when the small intestine becomes extremely swollen, it will inevitably transmit to the spleen. This leads to a general dispersion of energy throughout the body, without any unity. A physician must foresee this before the transmission occurs and make early plans; this is indeed a task of utmost importance.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>Yuan Judong was twenty years old and had developed a lump in his abdomen. He lay in bed for several months, with no doctor able to help him. Daily, he took strong medications to dissolve the lump, but his condition worsened—he became emaciated, his face darkened, his hair curled, and he seemed to have no vitality left. He was taken on a boat to seek medical treatment in the county, but fearing he might not return alive, he hesitated. Nonetheless, he continued to spend money on doctors daily. </p>
<p>When I arrived, his family&#39;s finances were already exhausted, so I requested to examine him to determine the proximity of life and death, with no other expectations. During my examination, I first inspected the lump from his lower abdomen to the side of his navel. It was divided into three areas, all as hard as stone, and touching them caused him unbearable pain. His pulse was only two inches wide and forceful, while the rest was faint. </p>
<p>I said: &quot;This illness arises from the lump, but the treatment targets the lump without investigating the root cause, leading to mistaken treatments. Initially, the lump would not have been hard; by harshly attacking it with strong medicines, the True Qi within became disturbed, turning the evil Qi into harm. It’s like a fight, where a tangle forms without any release, thus becoming tightly bound and difficult to loosen. In fact, it is fundamentally the accumulation of air, unlike a woman’s menstrual blood, which stagnates. </p>
<p>Looking at the two-inch pulse, which is strong, it clearly shows that the energy of the Shaoyin kidney meridian is transmitted to the bladder. The bladder&#39;s energy should normally be excreted through the front and back passages. However, by mistakenly using medications that break the blood, the Qi is also broken, preventing the Qi from circulating, thus resulting in a stone-like formation. Touching it causes increased pain, revealing significant symptoms.&quot;<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>If it is a blood clot, what pain could there be if it is removed? This illness can be cured with just one prescription, but due to months of misdiagnosis, the area above and below has been affected, resulting in injury to places without disease. First, use a tonifying herbal remedy to harmonize the energy in the middle and lower regions, then administer a large dose of medicine to internalize kidney energy and disperse bladder energy, resolving their conflict. After calculating about three doses, a complete recovery is possible. </p>
<p>First, with the formula of the Harmony Decoction, slightly increase the dose of aconite, take one dose, and the clot is reduced by three-tenths. Next, a large dose of cinnamon and aconite is administered; there is a loud rumbling in the abdomen, and soon, all three clots disappear at once. Friends are astonished at this miraculous outcome. After taking another dose, it was indeed fully cured. After regulating for over a month, the muscles regenerated, the face became bright and moist, and only a few strands of hair were left. Whenever the weather turned cold and gloomy, I had to cover myself with heavy quilts and thick blankets, not daring to get out of bed. </p>
<p>I believe the root of the illness still exists because the storage of kidney energy is not solidified, and the transformation of bladder energy is not vigorous. Coupled with being young and newly wed, there is a risk of engaging in intimate relations, which may cause the clots to reappear and lead to future troubles. Therefore, additional kidney tonics should be used, combined with cinnamon and aconite, and a larger quantity of He Che should be made into pills, facilitating the nourishment of the womb to support the source of bladder transformation. </p>
<p>After taking these, there was no longer a fear of the cold, the waist became larger, and the body grew robust. After a year, a child was born. Grateful for the previous kindness, I thought of building a shrine and making a likeness to repay this, and to pray for family fortunes during difficult years; this in itself is a substantial way to show gratitude.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Qi Jue</strong></p>
<p>When heat from the small intestine moves to the large intestine, it causes the condition of &quot;ji&quot; and results in heaviness.<br><em>[Note: &quot;Ji&quot; refers to a gathering that forms by accumulating fluids, as the small intestine governs liquids and the large intestine governs fluids. When heat from the small intestine transfers to the large intestine, it leads to the retention of fluids, resulting in &quot;fu ji&quot;.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: There is fullness in the lower abdomen, with roots present on all sides—what illness is this? Is it treatable? Qi Bo replied: This illness is called &quot;fu liang.&quot; The Emperor asked: How does one acquire &quot;fu liang&quot;? Qi Bo said: It is due to the presence of large amounts of pus and blood outside the intestines and stomach, making it untreatable. If one attempts to treat it, cutting and pressing can lead to death. The Emperor questioned: Why is this so? Qi Bo explained: If it descends, it will cause yin to manifest, leading to the downward flow of pus and blood; if it ascends, it will press upon the stomach and cause internal masses. This indicates a prolonged illness, making it difficult to treat. If it is above the navel, it is a reversal; if below the navel, it follows. One should not act hastily to expel it, as this relates to needling practices.<br><em>[Note: The roots present on all sides indicate that this illness resides in the blood, with channels connecting above and below. It is untreatable by massage; pressing for dissolution will surely cause pain and potentially death. This relates to a tangible pathology that is not easily resolved. &quot;Below&quot; refers to the lower abdomen; &quot;yin&quot; refers to the anterior and posterior yin. Thus, due to the presence of yin, downward flow of pus and blood is inevitable.]</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one follows the channels upwards, it affects the stomach cavity and the area around the stomach, leading to the accumulation of pus and blood outside the intestines and stomach, resembling a large bag. Above the navel is the air division of the abdomen, hence it is opposite; below the navel is the blood division of the womb, which is easier to flow and thus aligned. One must not move this; it must not be massaged or disturbed, but should be welcomed and taken away immediately.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: If a person’s body and thighs are swollen, and there is pain around the navel, what illness is this? Qi Bo replied: This condition is called &quot;suppressed beam,&quot; which is the root of wind. Its energy overflows from the large intestine and settles in the lower abdomen. The original point of the lower abdomen is below the navel, hence the pain around the navel. It should not be moved; moving it would cause a condition of dampness related to water.</p>
<p>(Note: The movement of qi between the skin and muscle causes swelling in the body and limbs. This wind pathogen injures the qi and stays around the navel and abdomen; hence it is called the root of wind. The wind&#39;s energy overflows outside the large intestine and remains in the lower abdomen, exactly below the navel, causing pain around it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: “I suffer from fullness and reversed qi in my lower abdomen; it has persisted for two or three years. What is the cause of this illness?” Qi Bo replied: “The illness is called &#39;si ji&#39; (breath accumulation). It does not obstruct eating, and it should not be treated with moxibustion or needling. The accumulation can be addressed with guiding and medication, but the medicine alone cannot cure it.” </p>
<p>(Note: The lungs govern qi and control breathing, hence lung accumulation is referred to as &#39;si ji&#39;. It gradually builds up over time, which is why it has lasted two or three years. This illness has a tangible presence in the abdomen and cannot be treated with needling. One should use the methods of guiding and harmonizing medications; both approaches should be undertaken together for the illness to be cured. If only the medicine is used without guiding, it cannot be treated effectively.)</p>

<p>When the kidney pulse is slightly rapid, the liver pulse is slightly rapid, and the heart pulse is slightly rapid, but there is no swelling, all indicate &#39;jia&#39; (a type of stagnation). </p>

<p>In relation to the four seasons: If the jueyin channel is congested, it causes ailments of fullness in the lower abdomen; if the shaoyin channel is congested, it leads to blood accumulation in the urine; if the taiyin channel is congested, it results in fullness in the heart and abdomen; if the yangming channel is congested, it presents as accumulation along with frequent fright; if the taiyang channel is congested, it manifests as accumulation with frequent headaches; if the shaoyang channel is congested, it results in accumulation with frequent tightness in the muscles and eye pain. </p>
<p>(Note: Congestion refers to more blood and less qi, with slight cold present. Blood conditions are termed accumulations, due to excess blood that becomes stagnant and forms a mass.) </p>

Water dysphoria is also due to accumulation from food and drink.]</p>

If cold and warmth are not taken in turns, and evil energy slightly arrives, accumulations from grains and livestock will remain, leading to a major accumulation.

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What is the condition of the intestines? Qi Bo replied: Cold qi is lodged outside the intestines, clashing with the defensive qi, preventing the qi from nourishing, which causes it to become obstructed and accumulate internally, leading to the rise of evil qi and the formation of polyps. At the beginning, they are the size of a chicken egg, gradually growing larger until they resemble a child in the womb. If they persist, they may detach from the organs; when pressed, they feel firm, and when pushed, they can move. Menstrual issues occur timely; this is its indication.</p>
<p><em>Note: Cold qi outside the intestines clashes with the defensive qi, preventing it from nourishing properly. The obstruction happens due to intangible qi coming into conflict in the empty spaces outside the intestines, accumulating on the tangible membranes.

The entrance is blocked, causing qi not to circulate, and the stagnant bad blood that should be expelled is retained, growing larger day by day, resembling a fetus.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Beginning of All Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, saying: All illnesses begin with the changes of wind, rain, cold, heat, and with emotions such as joy and anger. When joy and anger are unregulated, they harm the internal organs; wind and rain harm the upper body; clear and damp conditions harm the lower body. The ailments caused by these three types differ, and I wish to learn about their connections. Qi Bo replied: The three types of energies are distinct. Some arise from yin, while others arise from yang; allow me to explain further! Unregulated joy and anger harm the internal organs; when the organs are harmed, illnesses arise from yin. When clear and damp conditions invade the weak, ailments arise from the lower body, and when wind and rain invade the weak, ailments arise from the upper body. This is what is meant by the three types. As for their overwhelming presence, it cannot be counted. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I indeed cannot enumerate them, which is why I ask the Sage. I wish to fully understand this path! Qi Bo said: Wind, rain, cold, and heat cannot independently harm a person without a state of deficiency. If one suddenly encounters strong winds or violent rain and does not fall ill, it is likely because there is no deficiency. Therefore, the evil cannot harm independently. This must be due to the deficiency of the external wind interacting with the body&#39;s state of deficiency, leading to an affliction upon the body. When two strong forces meet, the flesh of most people remains firm.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Among the virtual evils, they rely on the timing of heaven, the physical form, and the interplay of emptiness and substance, leading to significant illness. There are defined spaces for Qi, categorized based on location, with divisions among the outer, inner, and middle realms.</p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;virtual wind&quot; refers to the spring winds from the west and summer winds from the north, energies from the five elements that are not balanced, thus harming the body. If a person&#39;s Qi is not deficient, even if faced with virtual winds, they cannot be harmed. Thus, it&#39;s necessary that both the individual and the heavenly conditions are deficient, causing interaction of both deficiencies, leading to a weakening of the form, unlike the common people&#39;s strong flesh. The three divisions refer to the following: the virtual evil impacting people, the external causes of illness; the aggregation that has already developed, the internal causes; the emotional and desire-related injuries to the organs, the ailments residing in the Yin. These represent the three aspects of internal and external.]</p>
<p>Therefore, the influence of virtual evils on individuals begins at the skin. When the skin is relaxed, the pores open, allowing evil to enter through the hair. Once it enters deeply, the hair stands up, indicating discomfort, and thus the skin experiences pain. If it lingers and does not leave, it affects the vessels and channels. At the channel level, pain manifests in the muscles; when pain occurs, breathing becomes labored, and the major meridians are altered. If it remains, it affects the meridians. At the meridian level, there are symptoms of chills and sudden fright. If it persists, it impacts the channels. At the channel level, the six major meridians become blocked, leading to joint pain in the limbs, and stiffness in the lower back. If it continues to persist, it settles in the pulse of the Chong and Yin.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>During the time of伏冲 (Fu Chong), there is a heaviness and pain in the body. It lingers and does not leave, settling in the intestines and stomach. When in the intestines and stomach, there are sounds and bloating; if cold, there are rumblings and diarrhea, causing food to not digest; if hot, the result is a mucous-like discharge. If it lingers and does not leave, it transmits and settles outside the intestines and stomach, gathering in the vessels, stuck and not leaving, resting and forming a mass. It may affect the Sun meridian, or the collateral vessels, or the regular channels, or the Shu vessels, or the channels of伏冲, or affect the sinews, or abide in the intestines and stomach, reaching up to the ren vessels. The evil energy is pervasive and cannot be easily described. </p>
<p>(Note: The evil that invades the body must enter from the exterior. It starts at the skin; when a person&#39;s form is weak, the skin becomes lax, allowing the evil to take hold, causing the hair to stand on end, and blood and energy to stagnate, resulting in pain in the skin. Inspection of which channel is involved, whether deep or shallow, allows treatment from the exterior. If it lingers and does not leave, its entry becomes gradually deeper, hence it settles in the collateral vessels, causing pain between the muscles. If the muscle pain intermittently ceases, the evil will exit the collaterals and penetrate deeper, and the main channels will take on this condition; the evil energy enters the channels from the collaterals, still present in the exterior, hence causing chills and evil cold. However, the channel energy connects to the organs, so there is also a tendency to be startled.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The areas of the defeated are where the vital energies gather, and their lingering must be between the joints and valleys. Therefore, if the pathogenic factor remains in the defeated, the Six Meridians become obstructed, leading to pain and stiffness in the limbs, back, and waist. The &quot;Fuchong&quot; refers to the channel of counterflow within the abdomen. When the pathogen remains inside, the blood and vital energies cannot fill the body, resulting in heaviness and pain. If it lingers and does not depart, it transmits to the intestines and stomach, causing symptoms like abdominal distension and noises; too much cold leads to rumbling and diarrhea, while too much heat results in loose stools. Outside the intestines and stomach is the area known as &quot;Muyan,&quot; which refers to the outside of the skin and membranes. If it is detained there and does not leave, it stops and becomes a mass, similar to conditions like malaria and distension. The &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Luo&quot; channels are minor collateral channels within the &quot;Muyan&quot;; the meridians are the main channels of the stomach and intestines. The &quot;Shu&quot; channels are the major collaterals of the visceral organs, responsible for transporting the blood and vital energies of food and drink. The &quot;Fuchong&quot; flows within the abdominal channel. &quot;Muyan&quot; is akin to the acupoints &quot;Zhongfu&quot; as the meeting point and &quot;Taiyuan&quot; as the origin, and similar types. The &quot;Lujin&quot; are the muscles attached to the spine; the &quot;Huanjin&quot; are muscles circulating within the abdomen. These various factors are situated around, before, and after the intestines and stomach. Pathogenic factors accompany and cause accumulation, thus leading to numerous excesses. Huangdi said: &quot;I wish to hear more about the origins of this!&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The accumulations resulting from obstructions in the Sun collateral channels are those that move up and down. The arm is the residence of the hand&#39;s Sun collateral, which is floating and slack, thus unable to hold the accumulations in check.&quot;<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the movement and flow within the stomach and intestines, as water seeps and pours in, is accompanied by a sound like bubbling. When there is cold, it is like thunder rumbling, causing sharp pain at times. When it affects the Yangming channel, it resides around the navel; when full from eating, it swells, and when hungry, it shrinks. When it relates to the relaxing of the muscles, it resembles the accumulation in Yangming; fullness causes pain, while hunger brings relief. When it pertains to the root of the stomach and intestines, pain radiates to the relaxing muscles; when full, there is relief, and hunger brings pain. When it concerns the penetrating vessel, it can be felt by palpation and moves upon touch, generating heat and causing qi to descend to the thighs, resembling the condition of being poured over by broth. When it involves the muscles behind the intestines, hunger reveals the blockages, while fullness hides them, and pressing does not yield any response. When it pertains to the pathways of the channels, they are blocked and stagnant, preventing fluids from descending, causing the openings and orifices to be obstructed. This is how pathogenic qi enters from outside and affects the interior from above and below. </p>
<p>(Note: This commentary on internal conditions focuses on the ability of accumulations to shift up and down within the intestines. Accumulations in the networks of the large and small intestines belong to the channels, wherein the networks are superficial and relaxed, unable to contain the accumulation and stop it, thus causing mobility within the stomach and intestines. If there is water, it seeps outward, creating a bubbling sound. If there is cold, it leads to bloating and rumbling akin to thunder, with associated sharp pain at times.)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The channels of the Yangming are the great connecting vessels of the stomach. Therefore, its accumulation is situated near the navel. When filled, the fluids of food and water pour outward, hence in great hunger, the fluids and blood are insufficient, leading to a smaller condition. The tension of the muscles between the sinews appears like the accumulation of Yangming. When full, it causes distension and pain; when hungry, the energy recedes and becomes stable. The membranes of the intestines and stomach are the origin of pain, connected through the tension of the muscles. When full, the fluids seep outward, providing comfort; when hungry, it becomes dry and painful. The channel of the Fu-Chong lies between the navel, hence it responds to the hand and moves. When the hand feels warmth, it indicates that the blood and energy of the Chong channel are abundant outward. Those resembling the state of being poured out are caused by accumulation and subsequently generate heat. The lumbar sinews are attached within the spine, behind the intestines; thus, when hungry, the intestines appear empty and visible, while when full, they are not visible and cannot be pressed. The transportation channels are meant to connect blood and energy; if blocked, then the fluids do not descend, causing the pores of the skin and hair to dry up.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: When the accumulation first arises until it is completed, what should be done? Qi Bo replied: When the accumulation first arises, it is caused by cold, and the stagnation leads to accumulation. The Yellow Emperor asked: How does it become fully accumulated? Qi Bo replied: The stagnation engenders cold in the feet, which causes the blood vessels to solidify. When the blood vessels solidify, the cold energy enters the intestines and stomach; once in the intestines and stomach, it causes bloating. The bloating then causes the fluids outside the intestines to gather and cannot disperse, accumulating day by day.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the channels of the stomach and intestines are injured, blood spills outside the intestines. If there is cold fluid and foam outside the intestines that clashes with the blood, it combines and凝聚成. Sometimes, sudden cold evil from outside, combined with internal injuries from worry and anger, causes qi to reverse upward. When qi reverses upward, the flow through the six channels becomes obstructed, the warming and nourishing energy fails to circulate, blood congeals and accumulates, and fluids become thick within the channels, seeping outside without dispersing and accumulating.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What about those conditions stemming from yin? Qibo replied: Worry and contemplation injure the heart; heavy cold injures the lungs; anger injures the liver; drunkenness in bed, with sweat under the wind, injures the spleen; excessive exertion, especially after sweat during intimacy, injures the kidneys. These are the illnesses born from both internal and external factors.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</p>
<p>Division of the Five Organs</p>
<p>Illness can manifest as accumulation or aggregation; how can we distinguish between them? Accumulation pertains to yin qi, while aggregation pertains to yang qi. Therefore, accumulation is characterized by being deep and dormant, while aggregation is characterized by being superficial and active. What is called accumulation is named for where qi collects, and what is called aggregation is named for where qi congregates. Accumulation arises from the five organs, while aggregation is formed by the six fu organs. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a constant location for onset, with pain confined to its area, having an origin and limit both above and below, as well as side to side. Aggregation, being yang qi, has no fixed place for onset, with pain not confined to a specific area, thus called aggregation. Hence, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and aggregation. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the liver is called &quot;Fat Qi,&quot; located beneath the left ribs like a cup, having both a head and feet. If it does not heal for a long time, it may cause cough, fever, and malaria, lasting for years without relief. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the heart is called &quot;Hidden Beam,&quot; arising above the navel, as large as an arm, extending to beneath the heart. If it does not heal for a long time, it may lead to worrying and vexing the heart. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the spleen is known as &quot;Fullness Qi,&quot; situated in the stomach region, as large as a plate. If it does not heal for a long time, it may cause the limbs to wither, lead to jaundice, and prevent food from nourishing the skin. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the lungs is called &quot;Breath Distress,&quot; located beneath the right ribs, as large as a cup. If it lingers, it may cause chills and fever, cough, and lead to lung abscesses. </p>
<p>The accumulation of the kidneys is called &quot;Swollen Essence,&quot; originating in the lower abdomen and reaching beneath the heart, resembling a tumescent fish, moving up and down without a certain time.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty - Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>On Diseases, Pulses, Symptoms, and Treatments</strong></p>
<p>A question is asked: What do the terms accumulation, gathering, and (殸禾) qi refer to in diseases? The teacher replies: Accumulation refers to diseases of the organs which do not shift; gathering refers to diseases of the bowels which manifest at times, moving and shifting, making them treatable. (殸禾) qi refers to pain below the ribs that, when pressed, alleviates, but may recur as (殸禾) qi. The primary signs of accumulation are seen when the pulse is thin and adheres to the bone.

<p>Accumulation, aggregation, symptoms, and parasites arise when the true qi of the five organs and six bowels is lost and邪气 (evil qi) invades. Over time, if not removed, they can manifest as accumulations or aggregates, symptoms or lumps, and can transform or act as parasites, each presenting differently. Some can harm people, while others cannot. Some are slow to cause illness, while others act quickly. Some cause pain, while others cause itching. Some arise in the head or limbs, while others have a solid form. Their manifestations vary widely.</p>
<p>This is a result of mutual influences between the internal and external, the true and the evil, where qi and blood conflict and combine. Accumulations are connected to the organs, aggregates to the bowels, symptoms to qi, lumps to blood, and parasites arise from the interactions of blood, qi, and food. There are five types of accumulations, six types of aggregates, twelve types of symptoms, eight types of lumps, and nine types of parasites, with names that vary.</p>
<p>The five accumulations are named after the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys; the six aggregates are named after the large intestine, small intestine, gallbladder, stomach, bladder, and triple warmer; the twelve symptoms include labor, qi, cold, heat, deficiency, excess, wind, dampness, food, medicine, thought, and worry; the eight lumps include blue, yellow, dryness, blood, fat, fox, snake, and turtle; the nine parasites are named as hookworm, roundworm, white worm, flesh-eating worm, lung worm, stomach worm, red worm, weak worm, and pinworm.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Distinguishing Between Accumulation and Gathering</strong></p>
<p>Disease can be either accumulation or gathering; how can we differentiate between them? The answer is: accumulation is yin qi, whereas gathering is yang qi. Thus, accumulation is heavy and dormant, while gathering is light and dynamic. What is stored as accumulation is termed &quot;accumulation,&quot; and what is concentrated as gathering is termed &quot;gathering.&quot; Therefore, accumulation is generated by the five viscera, while gathering is formed by the six intestines. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a constant place of origin, its pain remains localized, and it has clear beginnings and ends above and below, as well as defined limits to the left and right. Gathering, being yang qi, has no fixed origin, it does not stop above and below, and its pain lacks a specific location, hence it is referred to as gathering. Thus, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and gathering.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treating Accumulations</strong></p>
<p>There are five accumulations and six gatherings. Accumulations arise from the yin energy of the five organs; gatherings are formed from the yang energy of the six intestines. This occurs due to the disharmony of yin and yang, the weakness of the organs, and the invasion of pathogenic wind, leading to the formation of accumulations and gatherings. </p>
<p>Just like the emotions of worry, gratitude, joy, and anger, which are inescapable for humans, excess can harm the five organs, disrupt the four seasons, and create blockages, which then solidify into the five accumulations. Thus, in the liver, it is called &quot;fatty qi,&quot; in the heart it is &quot;hidden beam,&quot; in the spleen it is &quot;stomach distension,&quot; in the lungs it is &quot;breath disturbance,&quot; and in the kidneys it is &quot;running piglet.&quot; Though the names differ, the symptoms are also distinct. </p>
<p>The manifestation of &quot;fatty qi&quot; is observed under the left rib, covering a large area like a cup, being large and bulbous, resembling a head and feet, indicating liver accumulation. The pulse is thin and wiry, the complexion is blue, and symptoms include pain in the sides, pulling in the lower abdomen, cold feet, muscle cramps, with males presenting as hernia and females as masses.</p>
<p>The manifestation of &quot;hidden beam&quot; starts below the navel and is as large as an arm, rising to beneath the heart, resembling a beam across the chest diaphragm, indicating heart accumulation. The pulse is deep and hollow, the complexion is red, and symptoms include abdominal heat, red face, dry throat, heart vexation, and in severe cases, vomiting blood, leading to reduced appetite and weight loss.</p>
<p>The manifestation of &quot;stomach distension&quot; is situated in the epigastrium, covering a large area like a cup, being obstructed and unyielding, indicating spleen accumulation. The pulse is floating, large, and long, the complexion is yellow, and symptoms include decreased appetite when hungry, increased discomfort when full, abdominal fullness, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen feet, and muscle wasting, persisting for a long time without improvement.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition known as “Xi Ben” appears beneath the right ribs, large like a cup, with labored breathing and overflowing signs; this is called lung accumulation. Upon examining the pulse, it is floating and feeble, the complexion is pale, and the disease manifests as rebellious qi, back pain, shortness of breath, a tendency to forgetfulness, closed eyes, cold skin, and intermittent pain within the flesh, sometimes like the sensation of lice crawling or like the prick of a needle. </p>
<p>The condition known as “Ben Tun” arises from the lower abdomen, rising up to the heart area, occurring intermittently, and resembling a pig running; this is called kidney accumulation. Examining the pulse reveals it to be deep and urgent, the complexion is dark, and the symptoms are evident when hungry, reducing when full; there is urgency in the lower abdomen, lower back pain, dry mouth, blurred vision, cold bones, and prolonged illness leads to bone atrophy and shortness of breath. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when examining the six accumulations in the six bowels, the condition is different. How so? The six bowels belong to the three Yangs; Tai Yang expels clear qi, Yang Ming releases turbid qi, and Shao Yang transforms essential qi, functioning like the capital within a city, responsible for the regular transport and transformation of qi. If the six bowels become unbalanced, evil qi accumulates and does not disperse, starting with no fundamental root, unstopping above and below, thus pain lacks a constant location; if pain occurs above, it feels constrained, and below, it feels distended, with pain on both sides as if there were a solid mass that is easily rotated, hence it is different from the five accumulations.</p>
<p>In general, when examining pulses, a tight and surging pulse indicates accumulation, a floating yet firm pulse indicates accumulation, a horizontal pulse indicates accumulation beneath the ribs, and a small, deep, firm pulse indicates accumulation in the stomach. Overall, each illness presents its signs, and treatments have their respective methods. For example, in diagnosing abdominal accumulations, a firm, strong, urgent pulse indicates life, while a weak, urgent pulse indicates death. Similarly, strong and firm pulses point towards life, while weak, small pulses indicate death. This should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

Therefore, excessive dampness causes illnesses like spasms, which also involve the influence of wind. An excess of wind illness leads to dryness, causing the tendons and vessels to become tense, which also includes the influence of metal. An excess of dryness results in irritability and thirst, coupled with the influence of fire. Excessive heat can lead to the expulsion of bodily fluids, resulting in shivering and cold, which also involves the influence of water. </p>

<p>A lump (瘕) may feel hard in the abdomen, but it can suddenly gather or disperse, lacking a constant measure. Thus, the &quot;Holy Prescriptions&quot; states: a lump is akin to a falsehood, as its condition has not yet developed into a definitive ailment. The classical interpretation mentions: when blood does not flow and cold thins it, the blood remains stagnant within, forming a lump. Another explanation posits that it is a condition of accumulation in the abdomen. The classics say that heat from the small intestine moves to the large intestine and causes the condition known as &quot;lump&quot; or &quot;sinking.&quot; The commentary notes that when the heat from the small intestine has already shifted into the large intestine, the two heats clash, resulting in blood overflow and forming a concealed lump. If the blood is stagnant and does not flow, it causes menstruation to be obstructed and not proceed, hence the term &quot;lump&quot; is associated with &quot;sinking.&quot; &quot;Lump&quot; and &quot;concealment&quot; are synonymous.

If it lasts for a long time, it may cause coughing, reverse fever, and intermittent malaria. For those who suffer from this for years, it is the result. The accumulation of the heart is known as &quot;the hidden beam,&quot; arising from the navel, as large as an arm, extending upward to below the heart. If it persists for a long time, it may lead to restlessness and mental distress. The accumulation of the spleen is referred to as &quot;spleen qi,&quot; located in the stomach area, covering like a large dish. If it lasts for long, it may result in limbs becoming withdrawn and jaundice appearing, causing food not to nourish the skin, popularly known as &quot;food labor yellow.&quot; The accumulation of the lungs is called &quot;breath obstruction,&quot; situated under the left rib and covering like a cup. If it does not heal for long, it can lead to chills, fever, coughing, or lung abscesses. The accumulation of the kidneys is termed &quot;turtle obstruction,&quot; originating in the lower abdomen and extending upward to below the heart, resembling a turtle in shape; it may fluctuate between upward and downward without a set time.

Upon visiting various medical practitioners, everyone can articulate this, and when asked about treatment methods, they merely mention substances like three-edged needles, guo herbs, lacquer, ochre, dried tangerine peel, mung stone, and castor beans. There are also those who, lacking clear differentiation between root and branch, attempt to supplement this understanding. Is it possible for a person suffering from accumulation, with major evil not having been expelled, to remedy it? As for the medicines commercially available for accumulation, I, when I was a novice in medicine, if I had ever used them, found them ineffective, and thus chose to change my approach. By studying the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; I suddenly had a profound realization. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Wood congestion leads to vomiting, Fire congestion results in sweating, Earth congestion causes purging, Metal congestion leads to urination, and Water congestion causes reversal. Wang Taifu explained: “Vomit” refers to expelling through the mouth; “sweat” refers to perspiration; “purge” refers to bowel movements; “urinate” refers to relieving the bladder; “reversal” refers to countering the obstruction. These five methods are governed by the five movements, hence these five treatment strategies are established, seemingly in alignment with the five accumulations.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five accumulations arise when one is affected by the pathogenic influences that defeat oneself and then passes this onto those one has defeated. During times of abundance, these influences are resisted and not accepted, returning instead to the ones that defeat oneself. The ones that defeat oneself refuse to accept this, thus leading to the formation of an accumulation. </p>
<p>Therefore, the accumulation of the liver occurs on the day of Ji in late summer, the accumulation of the heart occurs on the days of Geng and Xin in autumn, the accumulation of the spleen occurs on the days of Ren and Gui in winter, the accumulation of the lungs occurs on the days of Jia and Yi in spring, and the accumulation of the kidneys occurs on the days of Bing and Ding in summer. All of these are due to oppression and withholding of the vital energy that is affected by pathogenic factors. Is it necessary to wait for the celestial authorities to intervene before these accumulations occur?</p>
<p>Moreover, the formation of these accumulations may be caused by aggressive emotions such as anger and joy or by sadness and fear; it may also be influenced by the consumption of certain foods that are sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, or salty, or by the intake of drinks that are warm, cool, hot, cold, or damp. Initial symptoms are often very slight, and breathing techniques or gentle pressure can often disperse them. Unfortunately, if one encounters an inept doctor who forcefully reinforces the condition, it will remain and eventually lead to the five accumulations. The essence of the fatty qi is not only an excess of qi but also involves blood, due to the liver&#39;s role in storing blood.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Fu Liang&quot; condition refers to a build-up of heat, which, when treated with hot medicine, worsens, while cauterization causes it to accumulate further. Moreover, there are two types of &quot;Fu Liang,&quot; which share the same name but differ in essence, requiring detailed explanation. </p>
<p>The first type has roots in all directions—up, down, left, and right—existing outside the intestines and stomach, accompanied by significant pus and blood. This type is similar to an abdominal abscess. </p>
<p>The second type presents swelling in the body, especially around the hips, thighs, and knees, with pain surrounding the navel. This is due to the root of wind and must not be moved; if moved, it can lead to water retention and difficulties with urination. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that while these conditions should not be agitated, it refers to avoiding major purging rather than complete avoidance of treatment, as doing so may cause harm when the illness subsides.</p>
<p>Regarding &quot;Pi Qi,&quot; it is commonly stated that cold leads to stagnation, but the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; considers dampness to be the culprit. Even if it arises from consuming cold drinks, the yang energy is trapped by the dampness. If attacked with heat, it does not disperse, but if with cold, the dampness leaves while the cold retreats.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Xi Ben,&quot; it refers to the breath becoming short and rising upwards, which is an old interpretation. I believe &quot;Ben&quot; pertains to the gate known as &quot;Ben Men,&quot; associated with the Hand Taiyin meridian. This connects the chest and penetrates the diaphragm, extending to the lower ribs. The symptoms include muscle pain, and in severe cases, this can lead to &quot;Xi Ben.&quot;<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The palm of the hand is associated with the arm, and its ailment manifests as chest pain and breathing difficulties. Additionally, if the lungs are low, it presses on the liver, causing pain in the sides. If the liver is high, it affects the upper region, leading to lateral discomfort. If we speak of this, it indicates stagnant energy in the chest that does not disperse. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; mentions that this kind of respiratory issue is frequent in relation to the five organs; hence I bring it up. The term &quot;chest distress,&quot; akin to &quot;chest heaving,&quot; is noted in &quot;The Copper Man,&quot; which suggests it may arise from excessive reading, though this isn’t universally applicable. The kidneys govern the bones, and this accumulation is the most profound and difficult to treat. It is crucial to avoid inducing vomiting. Since it is located below, it is best to expel it from below. Therefore, I have previously used &quot;Dusheng San&quot; to expel damp energy, combined with a wooden frame, ensuring it is in a warm room to facilitate both vomiting and sweating. The accumulation in the liver is said to relate to wind. After expelling several liters, one must expect a drop or two of blood; do not doubt this as it is expected in illness. Follow with herbs that direct and regulate the accumulation, having treated concealed phlegm first using tea to adjust and induce vomiting simultaneously with sweating, and then use herbs to lower internal heat.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I have also treated issues of stagnation with great success. First, use the gourd stem powder to expel the sour, bitter, yellow, sticky, and rotten substances—about three to two sheng. Next, direct water using the methods of Yu to flow down two or three dozen times. Finally, mix in lighter herbal prescriptions like the Wu Ling San. I have also treated hiccups using the gourd stem powder, regardless of the season, placing it in a warm room, with an additional fire to assist sweating, and employing methods of inducing sweat and purging simultaneously. This condition should not be taken lightly; prolonged treatment can harm a person. I have also treated phlegm buildup by directing water to clear the channels, achieving results with one purge every three days, ten times in a month, totaling a hundred sessions over time. After that, I use active blood-moving and qi-transforming herbs to grind away the accumulation. Although this accumulation does not harm the body, it can lead to a shortened lifespan. For substances in the six accumulations, located in the organs and associated with yang, they are formless and lack a fixed treatment method; treating them in this manner is not difficult. Some say my treatment for accumulation is too severe. I respond, it is not so. Accumulation in the organs, like sediment in rivers, comes from multiple layers of fat membranes in convoluted passages, within the complex anatomy.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the rivers and lakes, sediment is not found in the middle flow but often in the shallow bays and bends; when encountering overflow, it is swept away in a drift. Likewise, when it accumulates in the internal organs, the principle is the same. Therefore, I first use pills to eliminate recently ingested food, ensuring there are no blockages, leaving the broken-down remnants still displaced but not yet expelled; next, I use powdered medicine to fill the stomach and push everything down, like a raft navigating the river, clearing everything at once. If anything remains, I adjust with medicine. Only hard accumulations should not be treated this way and should be gradually removed. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: for hard accumulations, one must cut them away. This is what people nowadays refer to as mass disorders.</p>
<p>For food accumulation: sourness in the stomach and fullness, herbs such as rhubarb and cowbane, worse cases involve muconate and croton. For wine accumulation: yellowing eyes and dry mouth, herbs like pueraria and wheat bran, serious cases include euphorbia and cowbane.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Phlegm accumulation leads to thick and sticky saliva. For this, half summer and southern star type herbs can be used; in severe cases, gourd calyx and zhiling can be considered. For stubborn accumulation causing stabbing pain in the sides, three-edged and broadleaf herbs can help; in worse cases, glycyrrhiza and scorpion&#39;s tail may be necessary. Water accumulation results in swollen legs and shins; for this, plum tree and commercial land can be used, with severe cases needing glycyrrhiza and candytuft. Blood accumulation manifests as bruises and stagnation, especially postpartum; herb peach pits and earth elm are suitable, with worse cases requiring wasp and leech. Flesh accumulation appears as lumps or tumors; for this, greasy powder and white lilac should be applied, possibly leading to bleeding through needle acupuncture; in severe circumstances, mine sand and trust stone might be used.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A robust person has no accumulation, but a weak person does. When the spleen and stomach are weak, and both qi and blood are deficient, one can feel the effects throughout the four seasons, which can lead to accumulation. If one hastily treats this with harsh medicines to break the accumulation, the disease may go, but the person&#39;s health will have already declined. Medicines like lacquer, sand, rush, rhubarb, and kalonia may provide temporary relief, but once the effect is gone, the problem persists. As qi diminishes and the disease worsens, what benefit is there? Therefore, when treating accumulation, one must first nourish the proper energies; then the accumulation will naturally resolve. For instance, if a gathering is composed entirely of gentlemen, even if there is one petty person, he will have no place to remain. As long as true qi is substantial and the gastric qi is strong, the accumulation will dissolve on its own. If there is substantial accumulation made of foul substances, one must be cautious with potent medicines; how much more so when dealing with a weak person with accumulation? This is one aspect of treating accumulation. The balance of evil and proper energies should be examined thoroughly.</p>
<p>Regarding clinical practice:</p>
<p>A distended mass in the center indicates phlegm and fluid; on the right, it indicates food accumulation; on the left, it indicates blood stasis. Qi cannot form a block or gather; a block is a tangible thing formed by phlegm, food accumulation, and stagnant blood. Use vinegar to boil sea stones, vinegar to boil rush, things like wormwood, peach kernels, safflower, myrrh, and cyperus to make pills, and swallow them with alkaline white atractylodes decoction. To treat the block, one must lower heat and disperse food accumulation, as food accumulation is also phlegm. To move stagnant blood, one must nourish significantly once the block is expelled. Accumulation disease should not be treated with purgatives, as they merely deplete the true qi, and the illness will not be resolved. Instead, one must use medicines that dissolve and melt the accumulation, thus eradicating the root cause. In general, if a woman has a mass, it is often due to blood stasis.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The accumulation in the five organs is called the five accumulations, while the accumulation in the six bowels is called the six collections. Accumulations have a definite shape, while collections have no fixed location. Regardless of which classic you refer to, it is advisable to take the Ten-Flavor Great Seven Qi Decoction and swallow the esteemed Red Pill.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Classic of Needle Therapy&quot; from the Yellow Emperor, it states: How does the intestine swell? Qi Bo replies: Cold qi lingers outside the intestines, clashing with the defensive qi, which cannot nourish properly. This leads to binding and internal attachment, causing bad qi to arise and polyps to develop. Initially, they are as large as a chicken egg, gradually growing larger until they resemble a child in the womb. If they persist for a long time, they’ll separate from the years, feeling solid when pressed and moving when pushed. They align with the menstrual cycle; this is its sign. The intestine refers to the large intestine, which is responsible for conduction and is associated with the lung. The lung governs the defensive qi, which is the vital energy; it disperses with warmth and solidifies with cold. Currently, cold lingers in the large intestine, causing the defensive qi to fail in nourishing, resulting in binding and the formation of stagnation internally. When this persists, it is called intestinal swelling. When qi disperses, it is clear; when qi collects, it is turbid. This stagnation leads to the rise of bad qi and the formation of polyps, gradually increasing in size until the abdomen swells, resembling that of a pregnant woman.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This condition arises from a deficiency in qi leading to a blood stagnation, hence the menstrual flow is irregular and does not occur as it should. This is not due to conception, and can be identified as such. Furthermore, when it comes to stone obstruction, Qi Bo said: stone obstruction occurs within the womb, caused by cold energy obstructing the uterine orifice. When the orifice is closed, it prevents the smooth flow of qi and causes stagnant blood that should flow out but does not, resulting in retention and growing larger over time, resembling pregnancy. The menstrual flow does not occur timely and these issues arise in women, and can be guided to flow downwards. The bladder serves as a reservoir for fluids; when qi transforms, it can be expelled. Now, if cold lodges in the uterine orifice, qi becomes blocked and stagnant, causing blood to accumulate and not flow. Retention becomes hardened like stone, which is known as stone obstruction. This illness begins as a qi condition followed by a blood condition, hence the absence of menstruation makes it possible to address and release the blockage. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: when deficient, it leads to internal stagnation, with men suffering from seven types of hernias and women experiencing obstructions. This is what is meant.

<h4>Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</h4>
<p>If there is a drinking habit that forms a mass between the abdomen and ribs, resembling a form of accumulation, the use of breaking drugs is often ineffective. Instead, one should address the drinking issue and prescribe a phlegm-dispelling decoction. How to identify it as a drinking issue? The patient previously suffered from phlegm, experiencing excessive saliva, or has a longstanding phlegm condition. </p>
<p>For those with a drinking habit forming a drinking mass, resulting in abdominal bloating, pain, or even whole body swelling, along with yellowed skin and poor appetite, a decoction of ten ingredients known as the Great Seven Qi Decoction with red wine should be prepared and taken.</p>
<p>If there is an accumulation in the liver located beneath the left rib, shaped like an inverted cup or resembling a turtle, accompanied by nausea, pain in both sides, pulling sensation in the lower abdomen, cold feet, and cramping, over time, this can resemble malaria, termed &quot;fat qi.&quot; The Great Seven Qi Decoction should be used; after cooking and cooling, take an iron implement, heat it until red-hot, and pour it over the medicine to be taken while hot.</p>
<p>For a lung accumulation situated beneath the right rib, comparable to an inverted cup, if there is reversed qi with back pain, shortness of breath with a tendency to forget, cold skin, and intermittent pain in the skin like being pricked by lice, over time, this can lead to coughing and wheezing, known as &quot;xi bing.&quot; The Great Seven Qi Decoction should be administered, adding mulberry bark, pinellia, and apricot kernels, each at half a qian.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Accumulation and Gathering</p>
<pre><code>      Introduction to Medicine 【Ming Dynasty - Li Chen】

          All accumulations pertain to the Spleen
</code></pre>
<p>The classics state: Accumulation disorders, masses, and fullness are all due to the damp earth energy of the Taiyin. They initially arise from external influences or internal injuries causing qi stagnation. If treatment mistakenly supplements, it can lead to the formation of accumulation. Accumulation pertains to the yin energy dominating the five organs, with the pulse being deep and hidden. It may be found on either the left or the right, with roots felt, and pain has a consistent location. </p>
<p>Liver accumulation beneath the left ribs is called &quot;fat qi,&quot; indicating an excess of wind qi causing stagnation in blood, leading to rib pain or intermittent fevers. Heart accumulation above the umbilicus is named &quot;suspended beam,&quot; suggesting a beam-like obstruction beneath the heart that causes irritability, resulting from stifled fire. Hot medicine and moxibustion should be avoided. </p>
<p>Intestinal abscesses are similar; however, they present with swelling of the body, thighs, and back, with pain around the navel indicating an abscess. Spleen accumulation in the upper right abdomen is referred to as “distended qi,” wherein the yang qi is burdened by dampness, causing jaundice and fatigue, and food does not nourish the skin. Hot medicines are also to be avoided here. </p>
<p>Lung accumulation beneath the right ribs is called &quot;breath obstruction,&quot; indicating rapid and upward flowing breath, leading to coughing and lung abscess. Kidney accumulation occurs in the lower abdomen, or beneath the heart is termed &quot;running pig,&quot; evoking the image of a pig’s chaotic movement, causing alternating breath and bone atrophy, which is particularly difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Do not hastily induce vomiting or purging for any of these accumulations, as it merely depletes true qi without resolving the accumulation itself. Inducing vomiting for &quot;running pig&quot; is especially ill-advised. </p>
<p>There are five accumulations from ancient times, and today, the enhancement and adjustment of the five accumulation pills are even more refined.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The accumulation is formed by the Yang energy of the six bowels, with the pulse being submerged and knotty, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, hair without roots, pain without a fixed place. Use Sanju Decoction, Qiqi Decoction, Da Awei Pill, Xiangling Pill, and Da An Pill with ginseng. </p>
<p>Accumulation initially manifests as cold, so it is suitable to use warming and dispersing methods with formulas like Great Qiqi Decoction and Black and White Pill. If it persists and becomes hot, it should be treated with warming and cooling methods such as Mukxiang Binglang Pill and Tongyuan Erba Dan. If there are parasites, use Miaoying Pill. For external treatment, use San Sheng Gao, Sanling Decoction, and Shenyang Awei Powder.</p>
<p>Moreover, Yang deficiency with accumulation is easier to treat, but Yin deficiency is difficult to remedy intensively. For phlegm accumulation, it is best to avoid stagnating medicines and to take nourishing medicines mixed with tortoise shell, turtle shell, autumn stone, and cinnabar. Take Zhilv Pill, Da An Pill, or Su Bie Pill at noon; these are good for dissolving and transforming.</p>
<p>If phlegm accumulation is accompanied by cold stagnation at the navel and is mistakenly thought to be chronic coldness, using ginger and attaching warming medicine may initially seem appropriate but can worsen phlegm accumulation over time, harming the true Qi and depleting Yin blood. However, substances like sulfur and Aconite must not be taken, just as Zhi, Ba, and Mendo cold and cool substances that harm the spleen and stagnate Qi are also unsuitable. </p>
<p>The ancients said: &quot;Diminish it by more than half and then stop.&quot; They also said: &quot;Nourishing the upright will naturally eliminate accumulation.&quot; This refers to cases of deficiency leading to accumulation. In addition to gradual tonification, one must also cut down on rich flavors, moderate desires, restrain violent anger, and maintain proper thoughts; this will help achieve overall health.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Masses</h3>
<p>Phlegm masses can form into lumps from phlegm and food accumulation of stagnant blood, and these are categorized as accumulations. When the accumulation forms a lump that does not move, it is called a &quot;symptom,&quot; indicating hardness and firmness. Those that may or may not be present, that can be found above or below, or to the left or right, are called &quot;masses,&quot; indicating a shape formed from pseudo-blood that shows movement and has vitality. </p>
<p>For treatment on the left, one should focus on breaking the blood, using Hai Shi Wan or Dang Gui Long Hui Wan with five qian, adding one liang each of Tao Ren and Jiang Huang, then make into honey pills. For the right, one should regulate the qi using Qing Pi Tang or Mu Xiang Fen Qi Wan. </p>
<p>In cases of accumulation, use Xiao Jin Zuo Zhi San, Hong Wan Zi, Xiao A Wei Wan, or Dang Gui Long Hui Wan, and Bao He Wan, all with the addition of pigeon droppings. </p>
<p>For pathways of food and drink, emotional stress can lead to phlegm accumulation, treated with Shi Lian Wan or Bai Jie Wan. All masses beneath the skin membrane should be treated with Er Chen Tang, supplemented with qi tonics and qi-moving herbs.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Canon Must-Read</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Principles of Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>When the accumulation of illness occurs, it is due to insufficient righteous qi allowing the malevolent qi to take hold, much like petty individuals in the court when the gentlemen weaken. Righteous qi and malevolent qi cannot coexist; when one rises, the other falls. As malevolent qi increases, righteous qi declines; if one does not attack it, loss will follow. However, if one attacks too hastily, righteous qi may be harmed. The three phases of treatment must be understood: </p>
<p>First, when the illness is newly arising, righteous qi is still strong and malevolent qi is shallow; it can be allowed to be attacked. </p>
<p>Second, when the illness has persisted longer, malevolent qi is deeper and righteous qi is weaker; one should both attack and supplement. </p>
<p>Third, when the illness has been prolonged, malevolent qi is pervasive and righteous qi has diminished; one should focus on supplementation. </p>
<p>This accumulation of illness represents a principle that builds up day by day, not something that can be resolved overnight; thus, the removal must also be gradual.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is too urgent, it harms the vital energy; if the vital energy is harmed, it cannot transform, and the evil spirits will persist. I have once formulated a remedy consisting of Yin and Yang accumulations, with slightly potent ingredients. When used in moderation, it replenishes for several days, then attacks; regardless of how much is removed, it is supplemented again. When the spirit is strong, then I attack again, repeatedly attacking and supplementing, aiming for balance. This is my unique method, always effective. The classics say: &quot;A great accumulation and a great gathering can be violated, only diminish it by half.&quot; Therefore, by removing half of the accumulation, using pure, sweet, and warm nourishment to strengthen the spleen and earth, the residual accumulation will dissolve without force. If one insists on attacking without leaving any, the chances of causing death and calamity are few. The classics state: &quot;Those who are strong have their energy flow smoothly and recover; the weak, when affected, become ill.&quot; The ancients said: &quot;A strong person has no accumulation, while the weak may possess it; hence, one should nurture the upright to eliminate the evil.&quot; It is like a table full of gentlemen; no space will be available for one or two scoundrels.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although this is merely the perspective of the inexperienced, if there is a significant accumulation and gathering, one should not merely search and chase after it. Daily application of supplements without understanding will not be beneficial. By carefully discerning what causes the illness and what contributes to the accumulation, once identified accurately, deploy the appropriate methods to address it—what concern would there be that it cannot be cured?

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Diseases of accumulation result from food, blood, Qi, wind, and cold. However, the terms &quot;accumulation&quot; and &quot;gathering&quot; need to be distinguished. Accumulation refers to what has built up gradually over time. Gathering refers to what collects and disperses intermittently. An accumulation is solid and unchanging; thus, it is termed &quot;accumulation&quot; (积) because it has form. In contrast, what gathers and disperses, lacking a fixed form, is called &quot;gathering&quot; (聚). </p>
<p>All tangible conditions may arise from either obstruction in food and drink or the retention of pus and blood—when fluids congeal, they lead to symptomatic masses, all categorized as accumulations, primarily affecting the blood, which is tangible and static. </p>
<p>Conversely, intangible conditions, whether distended or not, painful or not, arising sporadically and transiently, classify as gatherings—a category primarily concerning Qi, which is intangible and dynamic. Hence, the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; designates accumulation as yin Qi and gathering as yang Qi, which expresses this very meaning. </p>
<p>Therefore, for any intangible gathering, dispersal is easy; for tangible accumulations, dissolution is challenging. When diagnosing these conditions, one should distinguish between the tangible and intangible, whether related to Qi or blood, and the treatment for accumulation and gathering will naturally become clearer.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The accumulation from food and drink, when it momentarily accumulates, is merely due to dietary injuries, which must occur within the intestines and stomach; thus, it can be expelled or alleviated, making treatment not difficult. However, if one&#39;s eating habits lack moderation, leading to gradual retention, there may be a feeling of fullness in the left side of the diaphragm, because of the stomach&#39;s extensive connections known as &quot;empty within,&quot; which emerges beneath the left breast and is responsive to clothing; this is the pathway of the Yangming Qi. If one experiences irregular hunger and fullness, with food being consumed successively, this can cause the Yangming stomach Qi to become disturbed. If it encounters cold Yin energy, the spleen is unable to transform it, resulting in lingering accumulation that combines with the fluids outside the intestines, clumping together and becoming difficult to disperse, eventually forming a condition of accumulation. Initially, this is very slight and many people do not notice it; as it persists, it takes root and becomes firmly established, making medicinal treatment difficult. Currently, many children in the northwest suffer from this condition, especially in regions where wheat is a staple; this is precisely because wheat is prone to stagnation, leaving disease beneath the skin and membranes, making it hard to treat. Similarly, women who experience blood disorders and Qi stagnation, whether above or below, often have issues outside the intestines and stomach, between the sources of the innate essence; therefore, one should gradually seek methods to dissolve it. Care must be taken not to act recklessly in haste, as doing so may hurt the stomach Qi, causing the accumulation to remain, which would only hasten the danger. Additionally, external influences of wind and cold can also lead to accumulation.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As the classic text states: The empty evil is within, lingering and not departing, residing outside the intestines and stomach, gathering between the origins, remaining within the meridians, breathing and forming accumulations. It also says: The illness is named &quot;hidden beam,&quot; and this is the root of the wind. From this perspective, we see that people nowadays who develop a mass after contracting malaria, this is indeed related to the wind and cold, and can be inferred. However, while malaria is clearly related to wind and cold, the accumulations due to wind seem unrelated. It is unknown that the stagnation of food does not necessarily lead to accumulation just due to cold, and the evil of wind and cold does not necessarily take shape without food. Therefore, it is essential for food to encounter cold, and for cold to encounter food, otherwise, when the superficial evil has not been cleared, excessive food intake will hinder it, leading to accumulation. The text states: The empty evil wind interacts with the body&#39;s form, and the two vacuities come together, thus lodging in the form. Truly, the origin of accumulation is often due to this. Even blood symptoms and qi stagnation arise from this. However, when accumulations are retained by cold, if retained for long, cold often turns to heat; when wind causes accumulation, and the accumulation forms, it is no longer wind-related. Thus, those treating this should only focus on the area where it is retained, and must not disperse it, so as not to further injure the vital energy. Only careful patients can understand the origin and reflect on it at the onset; then they can formulate effective strategies to preserve the spleen.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The accumulation of symptoms can manifest anywhere, whether above or below, left or right, as there is no fixed location. Generally, blood accumulates more in the lower parts, while qi and food accumulations are situated above the stomach and below in the lower abdomen. Any stagnation can potentially settle anywhere. I once treated a patient with food-related pain located at the lower right corner of the abdomen. Since then, I have frequently encountered this condition, realizing that the pathway for food must pass from the lower right abdomen into the large intestine, a fact not widely known. </p>
<p>There are also methods for treating food stagnation, as indicated by pain in the abdominal area, which can be verified. Therefore, in treating accumulations, it is essential to carefully examine the causes to ensure accuracy. I have seen Danxi&#39;s discussions state that a lump in the middle indicates phlegm and fluids, on the right indicates food accumulation, and on the left indicates blood clots. If something cannot be formed into a lump, whether gathered or scattered, it is certainly qi. A lump is a tangible entity, formed from the combination of phlegm, food accumulation, and stagnant blood. I believe that what can both gather and disperse is undoubtedly qi accumulation.</p>
<p>If we take the left as blood accumulation and the right as food accumulation, we would be mistaken. For instance, children often suffer from accumulations that are consistently found beneath the left rib, which is merely due to overeating. Thus, would it be correct to assume that just because it is on the left, it must be blood accumulation? If we claim the left side denotes blood and the right side denotes food, could it be that the right side has no blood and the left side has no food? This should not be established as a principle.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The key to treating accumulation lies in understanding when to attack and when to supplement, and one should discern the urgency of each situation. If the accumulation has not persisted long and the vital energy remains intact, treatment should not be delayed; for if it is delayed, it will only strengthen its hold, making it harder to control, hence this situation requires swift action. Conversely, if the accumulation has lasted for a longer period and the vital energy is gradually depleting, attempting to attack it now will be ineffective, as the accumulated energy is too distant to reach, while the vital energy is close at hand and can easily be harmed. The more one attacks, the more depleted it becomes, leading not to death from accumulation but from the attack itself. This highlights the importance of preserving life rather than focusing solely on the illness, which must be recognized. Therefore, when dealing with weakness due to evils, one should adopt a gentle approach, focusing on strengthening the spleen and stomach to fortify the foundation, using moxibustion or plasters to clear the channels. As long as the primary energy becomes stronger and the channel energy flows freely, the accumulated distention will dissipate. The balance of urgency and delay is the overall strategy. This principle applies not just to accumulation but to all illnesses.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescriptions of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method for Hard Masses</strong></p>
<p>When a disease presents as a hard mass that does not easily disperse, one should use softening treatments. For instance, when a lump forms in the chest or there is accumulation in the abdomen, the method is to employ medicine to soften it. If a lump forms in the heart, this is due to the stagnation of qi and blood; thus, one should use tonics for qi and blood, adding a slight amount of ingredients to soften hard masses, allowing the qi and blood to flow, which will cause the hard mass to dissipate on its own. If one merely attacks the mass without understanding the role of warming and nourishing medicines, the hardness will ultimately persist. </p>
<p>The prescription includes: one qian each of ginseng, Angelica, blue salt, five-flavor herb, bupleurum, and pinellia; three qian each of white peony and ophiopogon; five qian of cooked Rehmannia; two qian of cornelian cherry; one piece of aconite, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is excellent for its pure use of tonics, adding only blue salt to soften hard masses. If one is not focused on treating hardness, over time it will naturally soften; this is the subtle method of yielding overcoming rigidity.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The firmness of stubborn masses requires another method for treatment. The hardness lies within the abdomen; if one merely attacks the firmness, it will surely lead to disharmony in the abdomen, damaging the stomach&#39;s vital energy. Therefore, the approach should be to soften and harmonize within to treat it, allowing the nature of the hardness to ease, its form to transform, its energy to dissipate, and its blood to be consumed. Otherwise, tangible substances will take root within, while intangible energies will be exhausted externally, and over time, the firmness will remain despite efforts to eliminate it.</p>
<p>The formula includes five liang of white atractylodes, two liang of malt, eight liang of buckwheat flour, and one jin of turtle shell, along with three liang each of vinegar-dried white peony and poria, one liang each of pinellia, licorice, and white mustard seed, five qian each of radish seed, magnolia bark, and ginseng, along with three qian of cinnamon and one qian of aconite, all ground into powder, then formed into pills with honey. Take five qian before sleep each day, and with these fine medicines, there has never been a case of incomplete recovery.</p>
<p>This formula possesses remarkable efficacy, especially utilizing turtle shell as the main ingredient, which penetrates all hardness. Notably, the addition of buckwheat flour complements turtle shell to combat evils without exhausting vital energy. The other ingredients are all medicines that strengthen the spleen and regulate internal order, enabling the spleen to become robust and materials to naturally transform. The use of cinnamon and aconite as offensive reinforcements is particularly brilliant, allowing the turtle shell&#39;s forces to advance relentlessly. It symbolizes a benevolent leader; even if the enemy is strong, they would not dare to resist, scattering in fear. Additional forces follow behind, decisively eliminating without leaving a trace, integrating both suppression and pacification—who could fail to achieve victory in less than three months? This is the true excellence of softer treatment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the vital energy is not replenished and one only relies on Da Huang (rhubarb), Ba Dou (croton), and substances like Ai Wei (ferula), while vigorously attacking the disease, there may be temporary victories. However, the central plains will be ravaged, the fields desolate, and ultimately the granaries will be empty and the people will suffer from scarcity for years without recovery. </p>
<p>When someone shows signs of a lump or mass, with sudden onset and abdominal pain that cannot be touched, one can use purgative methods to expel the disorder. The formula includes one tael of bitter orange, two taels of white atractylodes, and five qian of burnt horse dung, brewed with wine for consumption. Horse dung is particularly effective at soothing pain without damaging the vital energy, and it also helps expel pathogens and transform stagnant matter, thus it is most suitable to keep it readily available in the medicine cabinet, as it cannot always be obtained in an emergency. This substance becomes more effective with age; there is no need to use it in large quantities—just one or two qian will yield marvelous results. </p>
<p>In this case, using five qian together with bitter orange will help dissolve the accumulated mass. However, merely dissolving the mass may hurt the spleen&#39;s yin, so adding two taels of white atractylodes will greatly strengthen the spleen&#39;s energy. Therefore, horse dung and bitter orange can work effectively to expel and disperse the condition; this is indeed a wonderful method.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

It also treats men&#39;s internal issues related to the seven types of hernias and women&#39;s masses with abnormal discharges. The pulse is deep and slippery.</p>

<p>Grind the Poria and Cowherb separately into powder, then mix the remaining herbs into a fine powder. Roll the mixture into pills the size of a jujube. Initially, take 2 pills, add one pill each day, and increase by two pills every two days until the stool becomes slightly loose. After that, reduce back to 2 pills, taking them with light salted soup and having meals spaced apart. </p>
<p>Repeat this cycle until the accumulation decreases by more than half, and avoid further intake. In autumn and winter, increase the Magnolia Bark by half a tael, keeping the previous amount at 1 tael and 2 qian. If the accumulation is firm and large, take the prior medicine first without reducing it, and in this formulation, add 3 qian of preserved oyster, but do not add if there is hernia or abnormal discharge.</p>

<p>The running piglet (bendun) rises to the ovaries, causing pain radiating to the genitalia; Guizhong governs this. The running piglet above and below is governed by Qimen. Hernia and hardness cause acute pain in the hip, radiating up and down the sides, with sharp abdominal pain and accumulation; Fushi governs this.

<p>Accumulation in the lower abdomen is governed by Laogong. Zhongwan governs abdominal distension and obstruction, worry and overthinking have caused damage, with Qi accumulating and severe abdominal pain leading to pus and abscesses, fluctuating up and down. Generally, if there is heat in the abdomen, with thirst and saliva production, it suggests tapeworm; press it with the hand persistently, ensuring it does not shift, then use a large needle to puncture Zhongwan and hold for a long time, if it does not move, then withdraw the needle. </p>

For accumulations, use the Middle Cavity, Suspended Pivot, Spleen Back, and Commercial Qu, and tonify; also the Cubit Marsh and Great Stream. For masses, use the Chapter Gate, Middle Cavity, Sea of Qi, Heavenly Pivot, Upper Cavity, and Communicating Valley. The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: For distension masses, measure the size of the patient&#39;s big toe with a rice stalk, extend the measurement to the heel, then measure from the tip of the tailbone to the end of the stalk, opening a chive leaf width on each side. Apply moxibustion on the left side if the left is affected, and on the right side for the right. Needle three times, apply moxibustion seven times, and the results will be miraculous. Another method: at the bifurcation point of the second toe, apply moxibustion five to seven times; if the left side is affected, moxibustion on the right, and vice versa. After moxibustion, if one feels movement in the abdomen that evening, it is a verification.

<p>In the &quot;Records of the Historian,&quot; it is said in the account of Cang Gong: Qi&#39;s junior official Pan Manru suffered from pain in the lower abdomen. I assessed his pulse and said it was a case of retained accumulation. I then told Qi&#39;s Grand Official, Minister Rao, and the physician Yao that if the junior official does not cease his activities, he will die within thirty days. After more than twenty days, he passed away from blood in his urine, a condition worsened by drinking alcohol. Thus, I discerned that Pan Manru&#39;s illness stemmed from my careful pulse diagnosis: it was deep, small, and weak, indicating a sudden change in spleen qi. The pulse in the right side was tight and small, revealing stagnation in qi. Due to this combination, he was destined to die in thirty days. When all three yin channels are involved, it follows a certain pattern. If they are not all involved, the urgency of the condition dictates the outcome; when one channel is involved, the proximity to danger increases. Therefore, when all three yin channels are engaged, blood in the urine continues as before.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In times of distress, a woman&#39;s illness was severe. Many physicians believed it to be a serious case of cold and heat, thinking she would die and chose not to treat her. I examined her pulse and diagnosed her with tapeworm disease, which causes abdominal swelling and yellowing of the skin, accompanied by a feeling of unease. I suggested a small dose of candied herb, and a few liters of tapeworms were expelled; her illness was cured. After thirty days, she remained well. This tapeworm was caused by cold and dampness; the energy of cold and dampness remained stagnant and transformed into worms. I discerned the cold was affecting her health by examining her pulse—her pulse was thick and her hair vibrant, indicating the presence of worm energy. The color and luster indicated no harmful or serious illness within.</p>

They then tied the turtle to the foot of the bed. Suddenly, a guest came to visit, riding a white horse, and the horse urinated, splashing the turtle. The turtle, frightened, tried to flee but could not due to being tied up, and it withdrew its organs, neck, and feet in panic.

The officer then vomited up a substance that was the size of a liter, which had an orifice and was crumpled, resembling a cow&#39;s stomach. The guest instructed to place it in a basin and poured one to two measures of tea over it. Everything dissolved, yet he only felt a slight distension; adding another five liters caused it to surge forth completely from his mouth. Once he expelled that substance, his illness was cured. When asked about the ailment, he answered, &quot;This is known as &#39;a liter of mass.&#39;&quot;<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

The doctor prescribed a drink made from glutinous rice, and shortly thereafter he felt discomfort and vomited a duckling, fully formed with body, bill, and wings, but for its left foot was still attached the meat he had previously eaten. The illness was then cured.</p>
<p>There was a person who accidentally swallowed hair and became ill, wanting only to swallow pig fat. When he opened his mouth, he saw something protruding from his throat and it received the fat. He then took a small hook as bait and pulled out something over three feet long, which resembled a snake but was entirely pig fat. He hung it in the room, and in ten days, it completely melted away, leaving only the hair.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Path to Filial Piety,&quot; it is mentioned: The monk Ying Gong from the Xianqing Temple had a condition that lasted for several years, where he could not lie down with his head on a pillow. Every time after the fourth watch, he felt a hard sensation in his chest, unable to rest, and had to walk around the temple. It became a habit, and no one knew what illness it was. He sought medicine from Dai Ren. Dai Ren instructed him to expel one or two liters of viscous saliva, resembling black alum water, then yellow-green fluid followed, and then several liters of pus and blood. After that, it felt as if a great mountain had been lifted from his chest, allowing him to drink and eat without measure, and he slept peacefully until dawn.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The station chief of Xi City heard that his father had died at the hands of bandits, and he was deeply saddened. After he finished weeping, he felt a pain in his heart that only intensified. For over a month, it formed into a lump shaped like an overturned cup, causing relentless pain, and no medicine was effective. It was suggested to use fire needles and mugwort, but the patient disliked this and sought help from a healer. When the healer arrived, a shaman was present, who began to speak nonsense like a madman and mocked the sick person. The sick person found this so amusing that he turned to face the wall. Within a day or two, the lump in his heart dissipated. The healer said: &quot;The Inner Canon states that worry causes qi to congeal, while joy allows all vessels to flow harmoniously. It also says that joy triumphs over sadness. The Inner Canon has its own methods; if the healer does not know this, then why use needles and moxibustion, which only exacerbates the pain?&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, the wife of Liu Ziping had a lump in her abdomen for eighteen years, her menstrual flow having ceased, and no treatments had worked. The healer instructed that within a month, there should be four occurrences of expulsions, followed by six eliminations, resulting in approximately one or two buckets of phlegm eliminated. Among the substances expelled were things resembling decayed vegetables and fish entrails. During the expulsions, wooden tools were used to guide the process, and the patient felt the accumulated sickness scraping away, gradually becoming smoother. Once the accumulation was gone, the indentation where the lump had been was like a mortar, showing no signs of damage. At this point, her complexion had a youthful hue, and her menstrual flow resumed, as if she were once again young enough to conceive.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the summer of Yang, the wife of the chief clerk Zhang was afflicted by a disease characterized by phlegm and heat, initially the size of a wine cup and accompanied by chills and fever. After more than fifteen years, due to her temperament being quick and prone to sadness, her condition worsened. Only about three fingers&#39; width below her heart felt normal, while her abdomen felt as hard as stone, making it impossible for her to sit or lie down. She had tried acupuncture repeatedly but to no avail, so she respectfully invited a person named Dai to inquire about her condition. Upon his arrival, he diagnosed it as phlegm and heat. He said it was acquired in late summer on a particular day, located under her left ribs, resembling an overturned cup, and it had persisted for a long time, causing her to experience chills and fever. Phlegm heat manifests as chills and fever.</p>
<p>He used a formula to expel the phlegm and she vomited out a substantial quantity of fishy yellow phlegm, about one to two pints. At night, he continued with another remedy, which caused her to expel a mixture of yellow phlegm and pus in about five or six instances, feeling pain wherever there was accumulation. Later, he used white atractylodes powder and angelica powder to harmonize the blood and facilitate her menstrual flow. After such purging sessions, which occurred three to four times, she finally recovered.</p>
<p>In the county of Xihua, Mr. Yan, a scholar from Mount Shang, had been suffering from accumulations for twenty years. His vision was impaired, unable to see small characters, and he felt as if his heart was a hard stone. Every time he experienced pain, it was unbearable, and his appetite waned, with his face appearing dark and his waist unable to straighten. Dai instructed him to expel a large amount of cold phlegm, roughly equivalent in volume to powdered stone, while at night he used another remedy to treat him with a mix of herbal pastes and fish innards, resulting in several expulsions. After his ailments decreased by three to four parts out of ten, he was given a warm porridge to help expel phlegm, which amounted to an entire basin. The next day, he continued the treatment, and over about a hundred instances in total, he faced little difficulty. Within five to six days, his dark complexion lightened, his appetite improved, his vision sharpened, and he felt a sense of emptiness in his heart, thus losing the sensation of the hard stone that had troubled him.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A skilled bowmaker had a daughter-in-law, thirty years old, who was already seven months pregnant. Whenever she experienced pain, she summoned a maid to attend to her, believing she was about to give birth. This occurred several times over the course of a couple of days. Eventually, they consulted a diagnostician, who examined her pulse and found it thin and weak, concluding that it was a condition of an obstructed mass rather than a pregnancy. According to the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; a weak pulse resembles the scraping of bamboo and indicates that a man has injured his vital essence and a woman has stagnant blood. The treatment for such a condition was to purge it. First, over a hundred small pills were prescribed, followed by a decoction of Stomach-Regulating and Qi-Promoting soup with added Angelica and Peach Kernel, boiled with river water and taken hot. After two to three days, more pills and the same decoction were administered, causing a mix of yellow and green pus and blood to be expelled. Each time she changed clothes, she was advised to massage downward with her hands to help discharge it. After another two to three days, more pills were given along with a preparation of pig kidney powder. After another one to two days, further doses of pills and the same soup were taken, and the condition improved significantly. Once the weather cleared and before eating, acupuncture was performed at the San Yin Jiao point to drain it. In less than ten days, the mass had disappeared. How is this different from examining the five organs through the abdomen?<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

The doctors treated it with blood-breaking medicines, but to no avail.

<p>A youth from Wangting Village entered, walking in a manner that resembled someone bearing a heavy burden. The healer remarked: &quot;This is due to a condition of the spleen.&quot; He instructed the youth to remove his clothing and examined his body; he found two lines resembling arms and sought treatment from the healer. First, he pricked the left side, which responded like piercing thick paper, making a sound as it broke, and directed him to massage it, which immediately eased the tension. The same was done on the right side. Those observing all expressed amazement. Someone inquired, and the healer answered: &quot;It is the stone gate acupoint.&quot;</p>
<p>A certain man, fond of tea to the point of addiction, had an accumulation on his left flank. The healer noted: &quot;This bears similarity to phlegm, but as there are no symptoms of chills and fevers, it is certainly not phlegm.&quot; Although he had been ill for ten years, he hardly labored for a single day. Moreover, his pulse was deep and thin, indicating stagnation. The healer treated him without the pain of needles or moxibustion, but with a little irritation for a short duration, allowing him to enjoy a full lifespan. First, he mixed tea to expel the accumulated tea water, amounting to several liters; then he used water like a wish-granting spoon and expelled several more liters, all turning tea-colored; next, he applied over ninety pills of the Three Flower Divine Aid, purging over twenty flows, with pus and water mixed, drying up phlegm and stagnant blood, all expelled together.

He experienced shortness of breath and could not lie down. At that time, it was the hot and rainy season, compounded by frequent diarrhea from consuming fully matured grains; he had tidal heat during the day and night sweats, and he came seeking help in a critical state. When I examined him, his pulse was floating and rapid, yet weak upon pressure. I remarked that for treating buildup, it is inadvisable to use toxic medicines. Given his weak pulse, how could I dare to use conventional methods? Therefore, I prescribed a digestive tonic to promote the stomach, and after several doses, his bowels adjusted naturally; combined with methods to balance yin and yang, and to facilitate digestion and qi flow, his abdominal swelling decreased, and his stomach&#39;s qi began to stabilize. I intermittently provided additional remedies, and within a month, he recovered well. The ancients said: nourishing the righteous allows buildup to dispel itself. For example, if the entire gathering consists of gentlemen, even a single villain cannot find a place to emerge. Now, if genuine qi is abundant and stomach qi is strong, the buildup will dissipate by itself. Can the words of the ancients deceive me? The classics say: great buildup is great accumulation; diminish it by more than half, and then stop. There is buildup qi within fullness; even with highly toxic medicines, one should not overdose, much less when there is buildup in a weak condition. This is also a facet of treating buildup. The interplay of evil and righteousness, fullness and emptiness, should be examined with precision.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: Gu Mingzhong has suffered from a stomach ailment for nearly thirty years. It swells in the morning and becomes urgent in the evening; whenever he has a major episode, his abdomen remains distended for over ten days before subsiding. Eating damp foods or overexerting himself seems to exacerbate the issue. There is a subtle, high throb on the left side of his abdomen, which makes a gurgling sound when touched during breathing. Using the &quot;mass and block&quot; method for treatment, focusing on both internal and external remedies, has been unable to cure him. </p>
<p>I acted as an internal observer, first enlightening him before proceeding with treatment. The human body has five accumulations and six gatherings, and the malice affecting the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys can be bound in the abdominal regions on all sides and around the navel, appearing as though covered by a bowl. The malice linked to the gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, and bladder are each situated at their respective locations but are not always visibly distinct. This condition is related to the yin energy of the kidneys, accumulating in the yang pathway of the bladder, resembling a mass or block. </p>
<p>How do we know this? The kidneys have two orifices: the left kidney connects to the bladder at the front, and the right kidney connects to the life gate at the back. When malice settles on the left side of the abdomen, it indicates the left kidney and bladder are primarily affected. Among the six organs, only the gallbladder does not excrete; the five organs receive the turbid energy from the five viscera, which cannot linger long and are thus considered excretory. Now, if the kidney malice transmits to the bladder, the bladder fails in its excretory function. The old malice has not been expelled, and now a new malice has come, inevitably seeping through gradually like a leather pouch enclosing something. The classic text states: &quot;The bladder is the official of the region, where fluids are stored; it is capable of expelling them when transformed.&quot;<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the kidney&#39;s essence accumulates without release for a long time, could it not be the bladder&#39;s failure to regulate its transformation? The human abdomen encompasses both the large and small intestines along with the bladder, and the membrane resides within the bladder. As long as waste is not retained for long, there is ample space. Now, if the kidney&#39;s essence does not self-restrain and is wholly directed to the bladder, and the bladder&#39;s essence is stored without discharge, can it maintain order akin to the clarity and spontaneity of the gallbladder? It is only reasonable that swelling occurs, as there is an inherent aspect to it. The classics say: &quot;Those suffering from kidney ailments tend to swell, replacing the heel with the buttocks, and the spine with the head.&quot; If the bladder were capable of managing its discharge, why then such extreme swelling? It is also said: &quot;The great yang draws essence for three days.&quot; The bladder channel of the great yang attracts essence and swelling ceases after three days; this is what defines swelling.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For several decades, where then lies the power of attraction? The method of treatment: Nourish the kidney water to achieve abundance, so that the essence and energy are deeply stored, resulting in the bladder’s swelling dissipating; nourish the bladder to invigorate the energy, thus preventing the kidney&#39;s anomalies from accumulating, and the processes of transport and transformation become ample. The reason for this is that if the kidney is not nourished, it cannot store; if the bladder is not nourished, it cannot discharge. However, it is easy to nourish the kidney, while it is difficult to nourish the bladder, for most herbal medicines are more about discharging than nourishing. When the bladder is insufficient, it leads to a definite end. Future generations fail to understand the reason; I venture to speculate that the more insufficient the bladder becomes, the more it swells, and extreme swelling will inevitably transmit upwards to the kidney; when the kidney becomes extremely swollen, it will inevitably transmit to the small intestine; when the small intestine becomes extremely swollen, it will inevitably transmit to the spleen. This leads to a general dispersion of energy throughout the body, without any unity. A physician must foresee this before the transmission occurs and make early plans; this is indeed a task of utmost importance.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yuan Judong was twenty years old and had developed a lump in his abdomen. He lay in bed for several months, with no doctor able to help him. Daily, he took strong medications to dissolve the lump, but his condition worsened—he became emaciated, his face darkened, his hair curled, and he seemed to have no vitality left. He was taken on a boat to seek medical treatment in the county, but fearing he might not return alive, he hesitated. Nonetheless, he continued to spend money on doctors daily. </p>
<p>When I arrived, his family&#39;s finances were already exhausted, so I requested to examine him to determine the proximity of life and death, with no other expectations. During my examination, I first inspected the lump from his lower abdomen to the side of his navel. It was divided into three areas, all as hard as stone, and touching them caused him unbearable pain. His pulse was only two inches wide and forceful, while the rest was faint. </p>
<p>I said: &quot;This illness arises from the lump, but the treatment targets the lump without investigating the root cause, leading to mistaken treatments. Initially, the lump would not have been hard; by harshly attacking it with strong medicines, the True Qi within became disturbed, turning the evil Qi into harm. It’s like a fight, where a tangle forms without any release, thus becoming tightly bound and difficult to loosen. In fact, it is fundamentally the accumulation of air, unlike a woman’s menstrual blood, which stagnates. </p>
<p>Looking at the two-inch pulse, which is strong, it clearly shows that the energy of the Shaoyin kidney meridian is transmitted to the bladder. The bladder&#39;s energy should normally be excreted through the front and back passages. However, by mistakenly using medications that break the blood, the Qi is also broken, preventing the Qi from circulating, thus resulting in a stone-like formation. Touching it causes increased pain, revealing significant symptoms.&quot;<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it is a blood clot, what pain could there be if it is removed? This illness can be cured with just one prescription, but due to months of misdiagnosis, the area above and below has been affected, resulting in injury to places without disease. First, use a tonifying herbal remedy to harmonize the energy in the middle and lower regions, then administer a large dose of medicine to internalize kidney energy and disperse bladder energy, resolving their conflict. After calculating about three doses, a complete recovery is possible. </p>
<p>First, with the formula of the Harmony Decoction, slightly increase the dose of aconite, take one dose, and the clot is reduced by three-tenths. Next, a large dose of cinnamon and aconite is administered; there is a loud rumbling in the abdomen, and soon, all three clots disappear at once. Friends are astonished at this miraculous outcome. After taking another dose, it was indeed fully cured. After regulating for over a month, the muscles regenerated, the face became bright and moist, and only a few strands of hair were left. Whenever the weather turned cold and gloomy, I had to cover myself with heavy quilts and thick blankets, not daring to get out of bed. </p>
<p>I believe the root of the illness still exists because the storage of kidney energy is not solidified, and the transformation of bladder energy is not vigorous. Coupled with being young and newly wed, there is a risk of engaging in intimate relations, which may cause the clots to reappear and lead to future troubles. Therefore, additional kidney tonics should be used, combined with cinnamon and aconite, and a larger quantity of He Che should be made into pills, facilitating the nourishment of the womb to support the source of bladder transformation. </p>
<p>After taking these, there was no longer a fear of the cold, the waist became larger, and the body grew robust. After a year, a child was born. Grateful for the previous kindness, I thought of building a shrine and making a likeness to repay this, and to pray for family fortunes during difficult years; this in itself is a substantial way to show gratitude.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>
