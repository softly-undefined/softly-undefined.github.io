<p><strong>On Various Breast Diseases in Women</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complete Book on Sores and Ulcers [Song Dynasty, Dou Hanqing]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The breast belongs to the Yangming meridian, while the nipple belongs to the Jueyin meridian. When toxins caused by shock and depression accumulate in the breasts, they form abscesses. At the onset, within two to three days, use deer antler powder mixed with wine for internal intake and apply golden hoop powder mixed with honey water externally. If there is no improvement, urgently use Jingfang Baidu Powder with added (grass tongue) loquat seeds and ground flower powder. If this does not disperse the condition, take internal prescriptions like Tuo San with white peony root and honeysuckle. </p>
<p>External blowing on the breast is due to the child sucking and blowing wind inside. Internal blowing occurs when a woman is pregnant, and the fetus&#39;s movements create wind outside. In decocting herbs, it is essential to include protective medicinals to treat both lactation and breast conditions simultaneously. </p>
<p>Soapberry powder is used to treat breast abscesses and pain. Use one soapberry burned to ash, three qian of clam powder, and one qian of frankincense ground into powder, mix with wine and apply by rubbing the breast until it disperses; externally, use golden hoop powder for application, or internally take Re-Yuan Tongqi Powder.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>For those who have ruptured, use ginseng, astragalus, fritillaria, and white atractylodes. As for young women aged fifteen or sixteen, their meridians may be developing, sometimes menstruating once or twice a month, or not at all for over a month, leading to this affliction. They often have insufficient energy and weak vital qi, so it&#39;s advisable to take the Baidu San with added rehmannia and then take the Huangfan pill; its toxins will disperse without endangering life. If there is only one nodule in the breast, it can be treated, but if there are three or four connected, it is difficult to cure. Treatment methods include Xiaoyao Decoction to regulate menstruation, and a potion to open the flow of qi, relieve stagnation, and detoxify, adjusted as necessary.</p>
<p>Breast lesions are primarily due to yin being extreme and yang declining; without yang, how can blood disperse? This leads to blood seeping into the heart channel, causing the ailment. If not yet ruptured, treatment is possible; if ruptured, it is difficult to heal. The texture feels like a mountain rock, hence the name. If treated early, there is hope for recovery; if delayed, it can lead to internal decay and possibly death from organ failure. If not ruptured, use the Quandu Flow Qi Decoction with added safflower, sappan wood, fresh rehmannia, cooked rehmannia, citrus peel, angelica, woot, licorice, and little bupleurum.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Women’s Good Remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Breast Diseases</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s milk is transformed from qi and blood. When the vital energy is weak, the milk produced after giving birth is insufficient. In the early stages of giving birth, if the breasts are hard and swollen, this indicates that the milk has not yet flowed; if the milk is expelled with anger, this pertains to liver channel wind-heat; and if there is a lack of milk after multiple births, this indicates an internal loss of fluids. Breast milk relies on the Chong and Ren channels. If a woman is ill in these channels and has less yellow milk, she may be weak and prone to illness. </p>
<p><em>Note: If the signs indicate that qi and blood are weak and cannot transform into milk, it is advisable to strengthen the spleen and stomach; if the liver and gallbladder are disturbed by anger and lead to swelling, it is advisable to clear the liver fire. Milk is transformed from qi and blood: above, it becomes milk; below, it is part of the channels. If a woman repeatedly gives birth without producing milk, or if there is constipation, one should nourish the source of digestion.</em> </p>
<p><em>According to &quot;The Great Compendium&quot;: All cases of women’s milk either flowing or not flowing result from weak qi and blood and unregulated meridians. Milk should not be allowed to fall to the ground, as insects and ants may consume it, leading to a lack of milk. If the breasts are full, it is good to sprinkle it on the eastern wall. There are cases where after giving birth, milk must be produced. If the milk is engorged, but after childbirth it is insufficient, this often occurs in younger individuals whose milk production is influenced by wind-heat; thus, it is necessary to take clearing and beneficial medications for the milk to flow.</em><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If, after giving birth, a woman has no milk, it is due to the lack of bodily fluids, and she should take nourishing medicines to stimulate milk production. If she has some milk but not enough, she should take medicines to regulate her menstruation to promote it, still using soup to aid this. Indeed, a woman’s milk is supported by the connection between the Chong meridian and the Stomach meridian. Women who have given birth multiple times and have consistently abundant milk are also those whose blood and Qi are not depleted.</p>
<p>If milk flows out on its own after childbirth, it indicates a deficiency of stomach Qi, and she should take restorative medicines to stop it. If there is an excess of milk accompanied by pain and fullness, she should apply a warm cloth to relieve the discomfort. If milk flows out before childbirth, it is called &#39;milk weeping,&#39; and it often leads to infertility.</p>
<p>Note: For the above conditions, if both Qi and blood are deficient, use the Recipe for Complete Nourishment. If there is heat in the Liver meridian, use the Modified Ease Powder. If there is anger affecting the Liver meridian, use the Four Herbs, Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Gardenia. If Liver and Spleen are stagnated by anger, use the Modified Return to the Spleen Decoction.</p>
<p>According to &#39;The Great Compendium&#39;: For milk flowing out after childbirth, it can also be treated with the Loose Reeds Powder.</p>
<p>Milk stasis after childbirth occurs when the infant&#39;s sucking creates pressure that obstructs milk flow, leading to swelling and pain. If untreated, it may develop into an abscess. Swiftly take the (herbal) Decoction and apply Nanxing, and also manually massage to relieve it. </p>
<p>Note: For the above conditions, it is crucial not to damage the Qi and blood; treatment experiences should be referred to for issues like milk abscess and milk stone.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>According to the &quot;Great Comprehensive,&quot; when postpartum lactation obstruction occurs, it is due to the child having eaten and then suddenly falling asleep, which leads to blocked air flow, irregular milk leakage, accumulation within, resulting in swelling and hardness. This obstructs the milk ducts, causing fluids to stagnate, resulting in pain from inflammation; there may also be swelling that is hard like stone, known as &quot;lactation obstruction.&quot; If not treated urgently, it can develop into an abscess; postpartum lactation obstruction requires immediate treatment. If not, it may lead to an abscess that can be fatal. One should take soapberry powder and other relevant remedies, applying the Tianshan star powder, and massage it to disperse.</p>
<p>Lactation jealousy arises when the child cannot drink, causing remaining milk to accumulate and result in swelling and pain. If the nipple is not stimulated for suckling, it will inevitably lead to an abscess. If there are sores caused by soaking, it is called &quot;lactation jealousy.&quot; In such cases, it is advisable to use red dragon skin decoction, Tianma decoction, Feiwu balm, and Feiwu powder, applying Huanglian powder as a poultice. </p>
<p>It is noted that if a mother has excess milk or the child has not drunk enough, leading to swelling and pain, stir-fried barley malt should be decocted, which will disperse the milk. If sores have formed, it should be treated according to the principles for lactation abscesses. If the skin has soaked and resulted in sores, the original method should be applied.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Great Comprehensive,&quot; &quot;lactation jealousy&quot; occurs postpartum when the child has not been able to drink, or when milk does not leak, or when the milk is swollen and squeezing does not yield adequate milk. All these lead to the milk and blood energy clashing, resulting in strong heat and intense thirst, causing pain that prevents hands from getting close.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>At first recognition, one should use their hand to squeeze out the juice and have others assist in sucking it out; otherwise, it may develop into sores with pus, and if the heat is intense, it will certainly become an abscess. If mild, it can cause milk stasis; if severe, it leads to an abscess. Although there are specialists, this knowledge is essential.</p>
<p>Regarding breast abscess and breast lumps, it is said: the nipple belongs to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian, while the breast belongs to the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian. If the breast suddenly becomes swollen and painful, with red nodules appearing, and after a few days becomes increasingly painful and swollen, leading to thick pus pouring out, once the pus is expelled and healing occurs, it indicates heat toxicity from the gallbladder and stomach, along with stagnant qi and blood, known as breast abscess, which is relatively easy to treat.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If at first there is a small internal nodule, resembling a turtle&#39;s egg, which is neither red nor painful, and over the years it grows larger, rocks and cliffs may collapse, resembling a ripe pomegranate, or may internally develop deep cavities, with blood and fluid dripping. This is attributed to the liver and spleen being obstructed by anger, leading to a deficiency in qi and blood, and is termed &quot;breast stone,&quot; which is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: For pain from cold and heat, one should promote sweating to dispel evils; if there is significant swelling and pain, one should soothe the liver and clear the stomach; if there is no pus, but pus forms without bursting, one should use substances to expel it; if tissue is not regenerating, with thin and clear pus, one should replenish the spleen and stomach; if pus emerges with renewed pain and symptoms of chill and fever, one should tonify qi and blood; if there is swelling, pain, and internal heat in the afternoon, one should nourish yin and blood; if there is diminished appetite with occasional vomiting, one should tonify stomach qi; if digestion is difficult, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain, one should tonify spleen qi; if there is swelling and pain due to overwork, one should replenish qi and blood; if there is swelling and pain due to anger, one should nourish liver blood. </p>
<p>One must be cautious not to use harsh medicines that deplete and harm the spleen and stomach. When “breast stone” begins to dissipate, use formulas that tonify qi and nourish vitality, such as Beneficial Qi Nourishing Decoction, Enhanced Peaceful Relaxation, and Enhanced Return to the Spleen, to promote internal resolution; using medicines that move qi and break blood can hasten its demise.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Gate&#39;s Service to Parents</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Methods of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For women who do not produce milk from birth, no treatment is necessary. However, if the condition arises from crying, sadness, anger, or grief that leads to blocked energy and closed channels, causing milk flow to be impeded, one should use clear broth from fatty pork to harmonize with nourishing foods. After feeding, take five to seven qian of a herbal powder and consume it continuously for three to five doses. Additionally, use a wooden comb to comb around the breast area over a hundred times, which should promote milk flow.</p>
<p>Another method involves consuming broth made from pig’s trotters along with tasty dishes, which can stimulate milk production. Eating four cooked pig trotters may also be beneficial.</p>
<p>If there is pain and swelling in the breast, this is also produced from the heart; it is commonly referred to as &quot;blowing milk.&quot; &quot;Blowing&quot; refers to wind. When the wind and heat obstruct the breast area, the blood vessels become stagnant, and over time this leads to festering and pus formation. A specific method can be used to counter this. The incantation goes: &quot;Carefully call upon the Eastern Protector to dispel this ailment.&quot; When using this method, first ask the patient what ailment they have. The patient will respond: &quot;It’s blowing.&quot; Take a breath and blow onto the marks on the palms of both hands while firmly pinching them with the thumbs. Stand facing north and recite the incantation seven times while blowing in that direction, repeating this process three times. When performing this method, have two women stand facing the patient and massage the painful area of the breast one to two hundred times. Repeating this process three times should result in improvement. </p>
<p><strong>Additional Discussions</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Hardening of Milk</strong><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The breast is associated with the Yangming channel, while the nipple belongs to the Jueyin. The mother of milk, unaware of proper nurturing, faces anger and resentment, encountering stagnation and obstruction. Overindulgence in rich flavors causes the Qi of Jueyin to stagnate, leading to blocked orifices and preventing the secretion of milk. The blood of Yangming boils, resulting in significant heat and purulence. </p>
<p>In cases where there is milk present, if phlegm accumulates in the diaphragm, the breath becomes hot, and the individual sleeps with milk in their mouth, heated air can lead to the formation of tuberculosis. In the onset of this condition, one must endure pain and gently massage to soften it, suck to promote drainage, and it will dissipate. If not treated, it will inevitably develop into a carbuncle. </p>
<p>The treatment method involves relieving the stagnation of Jueyin with green tangerine peel, clearing the heat of Yangming with finely ground gypsum, promoting the circulation of stagnant blood using fresh licorice twigs, and reducing swelling and directing toxins with Chelidonium or adding myrrh, dried orange peel, soap pods, honeysuckle, and angelica, either as a decoction or powder, adjusting as needed, but it must be accompanied by a little alcohol. </p>
<p>Applying moxa several times to the swollen area produces particularly swift results. It is lamentable that some practitioners, eager to show off their skills, carelessly use needles or knives to provoke pain. </p>
<p>If one is troubled by their husband or mother-in-law, feeling grief, anger, or depression accumulate day by day, the spleen Qi will weaken, and liver Qi will rebel, forming a hidden mass like a large chess piece—painless and itchy—that may take decades to manifest as an ulcer, referred to as &quot;youyan&quot; due to its shape resembling a rock cavity, which is untreatable. However, if one can address the root of the illness at its onset, allowing the heart to be at peace and the spirit to be settled before applying the treatment, there is indeed a path to relief.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Medical Outline (by Lou Ying of the Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Causes of Illness</p>
<p>Mastitis is often caused by phlegm from thick, rich foods and damp heat, which accumulates between the diaphragm and interacts with stagnant milk to form the condition. It can also arise from milk stagnation caused by the child&#39;s breath and boasting, or from suppressed anger leading to stagnation. Calcined gypsum, burnt birch bark, (wild) vines, licorice root, and green peel are all highly effective medicines. If women treat this condition early, it can be resolved quickly. During menstruation, it is generally considered a mild illness. In women over fifty or sixty, when menstruation has ceased, it should not be taken lightly.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The woman’s breast, like the man’s kidney, is essential to life. Those suffering from excessive thirst and vomiting are experiencing heat in the gallbladder and stomach; if severe, it can lead to toxic qi rising and obstructing the throat and diaphragm, indicating liver dysfunction. These are all external symptoms, best treated with Jin Zheng Qi San combined with Tian Hua Fen, which can alleviate thirst and vomiting, and stabilize cold and heat. If there is obstruction in the throat and diaphragm, use Gan Ju Tang with fresh ginger, or Hu Xin San. If these four symptoms appear after an abscess, it indicates deficiency. </p>
<h3>Discussion on Evidence and Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>Breast tuberculosis arises from indulging in heavy foods, anger, and worries, leading to stomach fire boiling over into the breasts, transforming the milk into turbid pus, with liver qi stagnation causing blocked ducts, resulting in persistent and unbearable swelling. Initially, it is advisable to use the garlic isolation moxibustion method, strictly avoiding needles or knives. If the patient can drink, administer one part of drunk cow fat with Chuanxiong and Angelica, taken once or twice for effectiveness. If the patient cannot drink, use Lou San. </p>

It can be fatal if it exhausts qi and blood. For urgent cases, take a mix of sixteen ingredients for qi flow and the Dan Qingpi Decoction simultaneously.

Xue Ji]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods for Breast Abscess</strong></p>
<p>For breast abscesses and nodules that arise from sudden anger or swelling and pain caused by a child&#39;s breath, one should soothe the liver and move Qi. If there is pain with cold and fever, it is necessary to dispel surface pathogens. If the swelling and pain are severe, one should clear the liver and detoxify. If there is no pus yet, soothe the liver and move Qi. If there is no pus formation or it does not rupture, focus on expelling pathogenic factors. If it has ruptured but does not heal or if the pus is clear, one should greatly tonify Qi and blood. I have often seen patients demanding quick results or not regulating their emotions and applying treatments without differentiating between deficits of meridians and realities; these cases are difficult to treat. Generally, cases beyond forty years old are particularly challenging because it is due to the depletion of Yin and blood. Generally, the breast corresponds to the Yangming Stomach Meridian, while the nipple corresponds to the Jueyin Liver Meridian. If anger harms the liver or rich foods accumulate heat, Qi will be obstructed, leading to blocked channels and inability to lactate, resulting in swelling and pain. If the blood heat in Yangming is severe, it will deteriorate into necrosis and pus.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>If pus forms, it should be punctured to avoid the risk of widespread rupture of the sacs. The breasts contain various sacs; if any pus appears, it must be punctured. Otherwise, there will be general rupture of the sacs. The young may recover, but the old and weak are often left without hope. </p>
<p>Breast lumps are caused by emotional disturbances, and they indicate a deficiency of blood and qi in the liver channels. It is advisable to use medicines to replenish qi and blood and to resolve stagnation. Generally, emotional stress causes obstruction of spleen qi and reversal of liver qi, leading to the formation of hidden lumps that are neither painful nor itchy, which many people overlook and find difficult to treat. </p>
<p>If any such condition arises, one should avoid emotional stress, stay away from rich foods, alleviate stagnation, and further treat with medications that nourish blood and qi, which may help preserve health; otherwise, it may lead to serious consequences. Some cases may take two to three years, or even five to six years, before rupturing, all of which are referred to as breast lumps, resembling a tumorous shape similar to a rock cave. It is highly dangerous. Caution is advised, as it may help preserve one-tenth or one-twelfth of health.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Breast diseases are governed by the Stomach meridian of Yangming and related to the Liver meridian of Jueyin. When the mother of the breast cannot nurture properly, it leads to turbid gastric juices becoming stagnant and forming pus. Moreover, emotional distress can harm the liver, causing Qi stagnation and swelling. Initially, there will be symptoms of thirst and vomiting, with alternating chills and fever, and significant swelling and pain; this should be treated with a Burdock Seed Decoction. If excessive rich foods and anger provoke liver fire leading to swelling, one should use a Tangerine Leaf Powder to disperse it. Moreover, emotional distress can harm the liver, while excessive thinking can harm the spleen. When thoughts accumulate in the heart and desires remain unfulfilled, it results in blockages in the meridians, forming nodules that begin the size of a bean and gradually grow like a chess piece. Over six months to three years, they may be painless, progressively enlarging; eventually, they become painful and will not resolve. Later, the swelling resembles a heap of chestnuts or an overturned bowl, with dark purple and foul discoloration, eventually leading to ulceration. Deeper formations may resemble caves, while higher ones might look like floating lotus, causing severe pain that connects to the heart and results in blood and foul discharge.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>At that time, all the five organs were weakened, and the four elements could not help; it was named &quot;milk tumor.&quot; Anyone who suffers from this will surely die. If recognized early, one may only use the Clearing the Liver and Resolving Depression Decoction or the Qi-nourishing and Vitality-restoring Decoction. The patient should further focus on calming the heart and nurturing, letting go of worries and hindrances, and taking medicine for adjustment; only then can one extend their lifespan. If a middle-aged woman without a husband contracts this, death will be even swifter, hence the saying that a husband is a woman&#39;s heaven. When the mass is first forming, prompt application of moxibustion on the tip is essential. The next day, when blisters form, they should be punctured; then, insert a thin needle to a depth of four fen, and place an ice vermin powder strip inside, sealing it up with paper. By the thirteenth day, the mass will fall off on its own. Use Jade Red Ointment to promote flesh growth and seal the opening, and continue to nurture to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>In the initial stage, redness, swelling, and pain occur, accompanied by slight chills and fevers, no dizziness, no dry mouth, and mild pain, which is favorable. Once it has developed, there is a burning swelling and heat, with intermittent pain, and if one sac has swelled without invading others, it is mild. If it has ruptured, with thick yellow pus, the swelling subsides and pain gradually decreases, and if it&#39;s itchy with new tissue forming at the edges, it is favorable. After rupture, if the pus stops naturally, swelling and pain dissipate, and new flesh grows easily, with the opening closing up quickly, it is favorable. In the initial stage, if one breast swells with hard pain, showing no redness, accompanied by chills, fever, irritability, vomiting, and inability to eat, it is unfavorable. If it has developed, showing no heat or redness, remaining hard like stone, with dry mouth, insomnia, chest fullness, and decreased appetite, it is unfavorable.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If the wound has burst and is not oozing pus, with the head rotting, swelling increasing, and pain intensifying, those who bleed shall die. After it bursts, if the flesh is purple-black, pain pierces the heart, the foul air deepens daily, and the body diminishes daily, they shall die. </p>
<p>Initially, there is fever and chills, dizziness and fatigue, with a rapid and floating pulse, indicating that the pathogen is exterior, so it should be scattered. If there is fever without chills, nausea and vomiting, dryness and thirst in the mouth, and obstruction in the chest, it should be cleared. </p>
<p>Worry injures the liver, and overthinking injures the spleen; if there is a firm and slightly painful lump, it should be treated by soothing the liver and moving qi. Once it has formed, with swelling and heat, pain occurring intermittently, and there is a desire for pus, it should be handled with detoxification. If pus has formed and there is swelling pain, it should be urgently opened. If there is weakness of the spleen and stomach, additional nourishment is needed. </p>
<p>If the wound does not heal, if the pus is clear and thin, and pain and swelling persist without relief, one should greatly tonify qi and blood. If a lump forms without pain, gradually increasing over time, and after it bursts, foul water flows, it is necessary to nourish the blood and clear the liver.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Jingyue Quanshu</strong> 【Ming?

<p><strong>Treatment of Breast Disorders</strong></p>
<p>For breast abscesses and nodules, if there is severe swelling, pain, and heat, and excess heat toxin, it is advisable to first treat them with a decoction of Lianqiao and Jinbai, which is very effective. If milk pours out after childbirth, it indicates that the Yangming stomach Qi is unstable; treatment should differentiate between the presence or absence of fire. If there is no fire and it continues to flow, it is due to Qi deficiency, and the Ba Zhen Tang or Shi Quan Da Bu Tang should be used. If there is excess blood heat in the Yangming causing overflow, Baoyin Decoction or Si Junzi Decoction with Zhizi should be used. If there is liver Qi stagnation with rising anger and breast swelling with overflow, the Jia Jian Yi Yin Decoction should be added. If there is a lot of swelling and pain with overflow, it is advisable to apply warm silk and disperse it. </p>
<p>For pregnant women’s breast disorders, termed &quot;internal wind,&quot; the cause is similar to that after childbirth, but medications should not harm the fetus. In severe cases of postpartum breast swelling, the Lianqiao Jinbai decoction is most effective.</p>

<p>Another remedy: take a spoonful of wild boar fat, mix it with a cup of warm wine, and take it three times a day; this will cause the milk to flow abundantly, enough to nourish five infants. Boar fat can also be used in winter.</p>
<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: for issues related to milk, the Tai Yuan point governs. For breast abscess with chills and heat, causing pain and tenderness, the root of the breast governs. For sudden pain in the breast, the Liang Qiu point governs. For breast abscess with heat, the San Li point governs. For breast abscess, the Tai Chong and Fu Liu points govern. Shen Feng and Ying Xiang govern breast abscesses, with chills, heat, shortness of breath, and restless sleep. Tai Huo and Xia Huo govern swollen and suppurating breast abscesses. For breast abscesses causing sudden numbness and swollen legs, with pain in the heels, needle downwards at the lateral side, three fen deep, and moxibustion at three points; the point is three inches below the upper lateral side. If menstrual flow is obstructed and there is blood indicating a problem, leading to breast swelling, needle at the midpoint of the little toe and the next toe, one and a half inches from the Xia Xi point, and apply moxibustion at three points. For breast abscess swelling and pain, when no medicine can relieve the pain, needle at the San Li point five fen deep, and the pain will immediately stop, as if by magic.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>The point is located below the knee, between the two tendons on the outer side of the leg. When lifting the foot, it can be accessed. The &quot;Ruminations on Filial Piety&quot; states: if milk does not flow, the points on the shoulder and the well are effective. &quot;Medical Principles&quot; says: for breast abscesses, puncture the center of the breast; the point is in the middle beneath the breast. Insert the needle one inch and a half along the skin toward the back, then perform moxibustion to drain it.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Introduction to Medicine,&quot; for abscesses and similar conditions in women, first cover the area with warm paper. Wait for the paper to dry to mark the site of the sore. Then, take a whole garlic, cut off both ends, and slice the middle into pieces about three-tenths of an inch thick. Place it on the site of the sore and perform moxibustion on the garlic with an moxa stick. Change the garlic after every five sticks and repeat the moxibustion. If the sore has numerous heads, mash the garlic and spread it over the affected area, then perform moxibustion; replace the garlic when it fails. If there is pain, moxibustion should continue until the pain is alleviated; if there is no pain, moxibustion should continue until pain is felt. The sores will then diminish with the heat. This method removes repressed toxins and has the power of revival.</p>
<p>Medical Case:</p>
<p>The &quot;Discussion on Perspectives&quot; states: My niece-in-law was eighteen when she suffered from a breast tumor. Upon examination, her pulse was slightly taut, but she was temperamentally impatient. The couple was harmonious, but her difficulty lay with her mother-in-law. Therefore, I used a single prescription from &quot;Materia Medica&quot;—green peel soup—interspersed with a modified version of the four substance soup to regulate her meridians for a month until she was stable.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>A woman, sixty years old, with a strong appetite and prone to jealousy, experienced no sweating in summer and had a quick temper. Suddenly, a small lump, the size of a chess piece, formed in her left breast. It was painless, and she felt her spirit was not well. Unaware of the dietary factors for half a month, she took ginseng soup mixed with green peel and licorice powder, adding fresh ginger juice to sip delicately, five to six times a day. After five to seven days, it disappeared. This was the beginning of a condition akin to a rock; if not treated early, it could remain hidden for five to ten years. Without pain or itch, it would eventually break down beneath the breast, causing pus to ooze out like from a cavity. Alternatively, after five to seven or ten years, despite normal diet, it could lead to internal decay or death. Some could not be hurried by their husbands. Women regard their husbands as heaven, and losing that heavenly aspect can lead to such outcomes. It is called a &quot;rock&quot; because it resembles a hollow cavity, concealed externally but present within. To eliminate this requires prolonged duration. Hurrying a woman to treat it early effectively eliminates the problem before it takes shape. Others suffered death, more than ten cases. I also treated a newlywed woman with just green peel and licorice to stabilize her condition.</p>
<p>The record from Xue Ji&#39;s medical cases states: A woman had internal heat and tension in her sides, with both breasts occasionally painful and her mouth often spicy. When lying down and then getting up quickly, she felt pulling pain below her navel; this was a condition of the dai mai meridian. I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang combined with green peel, Huang Lian, and Shan Zhi for treatment, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, due to anger, had swollen breasts along with headache and chills; this was an energy condition of the liver channel. I prescribed two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San, and the external symptoms subsided; then I applied Xiao Chai Hu Tang combined with Chuan Xiong, Dang Gui, Zhi Ke, and Jie Geng, and she was cured.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>A woman suffered from prolonged depression, with a hard lump in her right breast, which was a blood pattern related to the liver. She was treated with Ba Zhen Tang plus Yuan Zhi, Bei Mu, Chai Hu, Qing Pi, and moxibustion with garlic, along with the miraculous (herb) Lou San, and after more than two months, she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman initially had intense thirst, especially at night, and then suddenly her two breasts swelled. She took detoxifying medicine, but the heat worsened. Upon examination, her liver pulse was rapid and strong, indicating heat entering the blood. She was given a modified Xiao Chai Hu Tang and recovered.</p>
<p>A woman became angry, which caused pain in her left breast, leading to fever. As her exterior treatment was excessive, the swelling and heat were severe. She took several doses of a Qi-invigorating and nourishing formula, which stopped the heat and formed pus. As she did not immediately use acupuncture, her swelling and thirst increased. After acupuncture, a large amount of pus was discharged, and she continued taking the previous formula for over a month before recovering.</p>
<p>A woman suffered pain in her left breast and discomfort in her chest, which was due to Qi stagnation in the liver and spleen. She was treated with a formula that included Liu Qi Yin and added Mu Xiang and Qing Pi, and she felt better.</p>
<p>A woman had clear pus and a hard swelling, with a pale face and little appetite, internal heat and afternoon fever, spontaneous or night sweats, and irregular menstruation. This indicated deficiency of both liver and spleen Qi and blood. She was given Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with additional Yuan Zhi and Bei Mu, and 30 more doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Externally, she applied scallion poultices, leading to resolution.</p>
<p>A woman experiencing swelling and pain from pus formation wanted to have acupuncture but was hesitant to let toxins spread. She did not follow through. After several days, the pus was drained in about three to four bowls, and with her weakness increased to a critical state, she was treated with tonifying herbs. It took over two months before she finally recovered.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>A woman who was naturally weak and depressed suffered from a plague, resulting in further weakness of her spleen and stomach, leading to reduced appetite. She became angry, causing her right breast to become red and swollen, accompanied by internal pain. Applying fried bran made the internal pain worse. After taking a modified Mingwu Decoction, the swelling increased, with pain radiating through her chest and sides. I diagnosed the post-illness weakness of her spleen, and the anger harming her liver. I prescribed Ba Zhen Decoction with Chen Pi, Huang Qi, Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Bai Zhi, which showed slight improvement; then I replaced Bai Zhi with Qing Pi, Mu Xiang, and Jie geng, and after six more doses, she felt stable.</p>
<p>Another woman had a swelling in her left breast resembling a peach; it was neither painful nor red, and she was gradually losing weight due to heat, indicating stagnation in her liver and spleen. I used Ba Zhen Decoction with Xiang Fu, Yuan Zhi, Qing Pi, and Chai Hu for over a hundred doses, combined with Shen Xiao (caoshe) Lou San for more than thirty doses, and the pus eventually broke and she healed.</p>
<p>One more woman had persistent depression which resulted in a nodule in her left breast, about the size of an apricot, that did not resolve for three months. Her pulse was thick, and her spleen pulse was large and weak. This indicated deficiency in her liver and spleen&#39;s qi and blood. After using Ba Zhen with Bei Mu, Yuan Zhi, Xiang Fu, Chai Hu, Qing Pi, and Jie geng for over fifty doses, she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, who had a naturally excitable temperament and had been depressed for a long time, developed a small nodule in her left breast that was slightly painful to touch. This was all due to qi and blood stagnation. I prescribed Lian Qiao Decoction for about ten doses, which resulted in slight reduction, followed by Ba Zhen Decoction with Qing Pi, Xiang Fu, Jie geng, and Bei Mu for over twenty doses, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>A woman had three lumps in her right breast that did not dissolve for over a year. She experienced morning chills and evening fevers, and found her food unappetizing. This was due to insufficient liver and spleen energy and blood. She was prescribed a tonic to restore energy and nourishment internally, and externally treated with aromatic cakes applied to the area. After more than a year, her energy and blood were restored.</p>
<p>Another woman had a lump in her breast for over a year, experiencing evening fevers and reduced appetite. I believed this was due to insufficient blood and energy and wanted to use the tonic, but she instead took a remedy to promote the flow of qi, resulting in the lump erupting with clear pus, leading to her demise. A third woman had a lump in her breast the size of a chestnut and took the same tonic; it grew to the size of a bowl, hard as stone, and she eventually bled out and died.</p>
<p>A woman over twenty years old, naturally weak, suffered from pain in her breast and headaches with a floating pulse. I prescribed a dose of Ren Shen Bai Du San with double the amount of ginseng. The exterior symptoms resolved, but her appetite remained poor and she had slight fevers in the afternoons. I combined Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Liu Jun Zi Tang, and after two doses her fever subsided and her appetite returned. I then used a formula to relieve the blockage, adding Chai Hu over ten doses; acupuncture was performed to drain the pus, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>In another instance, a woman with this condition had developed pus and feared acupuncture. As her condition worsened, I had to apply strong acupuncture, which resulted in about three bowls of pus being expelled. Her pulse was rapid and she felt thirsty. I administered more than thirty doses of a powerful tonic, leading to her recovery. Dan Xi stated: The breast is related to the Yangming channel, and the nipple belongs to the Jueyin channel. Jueyin refers to the liver, which is a critical area for women and where connected vessels reside. Initially, swelling may be severe, but typically only one or two sacs are affected. If pus forms and is not needled, it can lead to the rupture of various sacs. While the robust may still recover, the weak often do not, thus it is imperative to apply acupuncture before recovery can be achieved.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>A woman had a lump in her breast the size of an egg, which caused pain when she exerted herself and did not go away after a long time. She took herbal medicine without effect. This was a case of lactational disease caused by a deficiency of liver blood. Initially, I prescribed four doses of an effective herbal formula. After applying herbal moxa with garlic, the swelling reduced; then she took Ba Zhen Decoction, increasing the amounts of Xiang Fu, Xia Ku Cao, and Pu Gong Ying, while continuing the earlier formula. After a month, it disappeared. </p>
<p>There is also a condition known as mastitis, characterized by a hard swollen lump that does not rupture even if it breaks. This swelling also does not go down; in such cases, it is crucial to take the herbal formula and apply garlic moxa. These two conditions are caused by emotional strain and depletion of qi and blood, also classified as lactational disorders. One should avoid anger, regulate diet, and be cautious in daily activities; otherwise, treatment may fail.</p>
<p>A man had a breast boil with plenty of qi and blood, but the sore would not close and treatments were ineffective. I prescribed four doses of the effective herbal formula, which helped slightly; then I gave several more doses and treated him with a soybean paste moxa, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>One woman had a similar issue that hadn&#39;t ruptured yet and responded to three doses of the same medicine, leading to resolution. Liangfu mentioned that if there is a breast boil, taking this medicine immediately can stem the root of the illness. If toxicity has formed, it can transform pus into fluid; if toxicity has not formed, it can be expelled through urine and feces.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>A woman, a concubine of the Guo family, was released from the palace at the age of forty. She had a hard nodule in her left breast that caused slight pain when pressed. Her pulse was weak and she spoke little, indicating a condition of stagnation, referred to as &quot;breast rock.&quot; It was necessary for her to take medications to resolve the stagnation and nourish her blood and qi, with a treatment of one hundred applications being able to ensure her recovery. Guo disagreed and instead took a formula called &quot;Ten Xuan San&quot; to disperse qi, which resulted in a worsening of her condition. After more than two years, she requested another examination. The swelling resembled an inverted bowl, solid like stone, with pus discharging like wash water. I noted that the pus was clear and her pulse strong, with symptoms of cold and heat, thirst, and despite treatment, she ultimately passed away.</p>
<p>Another woman suffered from breast abscess, experiencing chills, fever, and headaches. I prescribed a dose of Jing Fang Bai Du San; additionally, she was given a handful of dandelion, crushed, mixed with two to three cups of wine, and re-crushed. She drank the warm wine and applied the dregs to the affected area, resulting in reduction of the swelling. Danxi said: this herb disperses heat toxins, reduces swelling, and also dispels stagnant qi, acting as an effective remedy against toxic substances.</p>
<p>Another woman had a breast abscess and developed a fever after recovering. She did not respond to qi and blood nourishing medications. I gave her four doses of Ba Zhen Tang with added roasted dried ginger and then reduced the treatment, returning to the original formula with Huang Qi and Xiang Fu for over thirty doses, which helped stabilize her qi and blood.</p>
<p>Yet another woman had a swelling in her breast that did not form pus. I prescribed a formula for nourishing qi and promoting vitality with added Xiang Fu and Qing Pi for several doses, which led to the formation of pus. After needling, she improved within ten days.</p>
<p>Lastly, a woman had a swollen right breast accompanied by fever, feeling lethargic and overly sleepy, lacking energy to move. As the fever intensified at night, I treated her with a combination of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Xiao Yao San, and she eventually recovered.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>A woman often experienced pain in her breasts and a prickling sensation in her mouth. Whenever she got up or lay down, she felt a pulling pain below her navel. She was treated with Xiaochaihu decoction combined with Qingpi, Huanglian, and Shanzhizi, and was cured.</p>
<p>Another woman, after giving birth to her second child, had no milk. After taking lactation herbs, she only felt bloated. I suggested that since human milk is transformed from qi and blood, the presence of bloating without milk indicated that her qi and blood were depleted and her fluids were lost. Therefore, she should replenish her qi and blood to naturally produce milk. I prescribed a modified Baizhen decoction with double the amount of ginseng and atractylodes, and a little more cinnamon. After twenty doses, her milk finally came in. However, due to subsequent labor, she became depleted again. </p>
<p>It was apparent that her initial milk had occurred in the first pregnancy, while the second pregnancy had yielded none, indicating that her qi and blood were only sufficient for one birth. It&#39;s understandable for some women to have persistent milk after childbirth, which is also due to qi deficiency, and such cases should be treated to stop the milk. If milk is interrupted and the child does not suckle, resulting in bloating, one can use malt powder ground into a fine powder and take it with warm water to disperse the bloating. If the child causes the nipple to crack and become sore, dandelion powder or a mixture of Huanglian and fat powder can be applied. For cracked nipples, applying clove powder, clam powder, or rouge can also be effective.</p>
<p>A postpartum woman engaged in labor suddenly experienced a surge of milk, feeling faint and expectorating phlegm. This was indicative of a deficiency in yang qi, causing a fainting episode. After administering Dushen decoction, she recovered, and further doses of Shiquan Dachuan decoction stabilized her condition. If a woman has an abundance of qi and blood but experiences swelling in her breasts, sometimes without the child suckling, accompanied by swelling pain and aversion to cold with fever, using two or three taels of malt, fried until cooked, and decocted in water will immediately relieve the condition. This illustrates the consumption of blood and qi. What if the spleen and stomach are weak, and the diet is not properly digested? One should use these herbs more liberally in the formula.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>A woman who had just given birth had a history of excessive liver heat and suffered from a condition of damp-heat sores, characterized by internal itching and pain, reduced appetite, thirst, and frequent urination. She was treated with a modified Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Tang, along with Aloe vera pills and a wash made from herba Hedyotidis, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, due to insufficient milk, took medicine to promote lactation, which resulted in swollen breasts, fever, and thirst. I thought this was due to deficiency of blood and qi, so I treated her with Yu Lu San, which led to her recovery.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment,&quot; in the year of the Lunar Calendar Gengwu under the Longqing reign, I returned from autumn examinations to find that my deceased sister had fallen ill. Her condition began back in July with breast swelling and pain that did not dissipate. In August, a doctor used fire needles to draw out pus; they administered Shi Quan Da Bu Tang and externally applied Tie Hu San, but this was ineffective and instead caused coughing and shortness of breath. By September, she gave birth to a daughter, but the sores enlarged and her breasts became entirely rotten, extending to her chest and armpits, with thick, sticky pus, totaling around six to seven liters, with no signs of healing. </p>
<p>In November, I finally returned to consult doctors, who changed her treatment to detoxifying and harmonizing remedies, and externally added Sheng Ji San, dragon bone, and cold-water stone. The pus continued to flow profusely, splattering everywhere, and the swollen areas began to burst, with ten or more dark purple sore openings on both sides, and swelling and rot extending to her chest and limbs, rendering her unable to move to one side; her condition was alarming. I believed postpartum toxins had risen unchecked and suggested she take more Astragalus to detoxify, nourish blood, enhance qi, and promote flesh regeneration, but the doctors dared not administer it.</p>
<p>By mid-December, her condition worsened, with over twenty ulcer openings, and all tested medications were ineffective, prompting me to use my own remedies. At the time, the pus was foul and sticky, so I prepared a soup from pig trotters to wash her, which provided immediate relief.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>A formula was created called Huangqi Tuoli Decoction. The sweet and warm properties of Huangqi serve as the main ingredient to expel pus and invigorate qi in the muscles; Licorice supplements the stomach qi and detoxifies, while Angelica harmonizes the blood and serves as a subordinate. The herbs Shengma, Gegeng, and Louluren act on the Yangming meridian, and Lianqiao and Fangfeng disperse blockages in the women&#39;s channels. The herbs Louren and Shuzanzhi detoxify and reduce swelling, while Zaogao Thorn guides to the point of suppuration. Baizhi is added to expel pus and promote tissue growth in Yangming. Additionally, three parts of Chuanxiong, along with some Cinnamon and Stir-fried Licorice for their guiding properties, are included; each dose is prepared with a cup of wine and boiled to create the Baiyushuang pill, which helps to clear pus and detoxify. When the pus is thick and sticky, methods to stop it suddenly should not be used; instead, one ought to pursue it, adding Cuiren&#39;s powder externally. The next day, if the pus becomes thin and the pain diminishes, it indicates a tendency towards recovery. By the new year of the Xinwei year, signs of recovery with new tissue forming are evident in purple swelling areas. The scallion compress method is used to disperse it as needed, but for areas near the armpit and feet where the Shaoyang meridian is still not fully resolved, an additional amount of Chaihu (one qian) and Qingpi (three parts) along with double the amount of Chuanxiong are added. When the pus is almost cleared, a poultice of soupu powder is applied, and after the Lantern Festival, complete recovery is achieved.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The &quot;Orthodox Surgery&quot; states: A woman, because of anger, experienced swelling and pain in her left breast, with alternating chills and fever. After administering a dose of Ginseng Baidu Decoction, the external symptoms subsided. Following that, two doses of Burdock Seed Decoction were given, and the swelling gradually decreased and stabilized.</p>
<p>Another woman, from excessive worry and prolonged depression, developed pain, with a lump in her breast resembling a peach for half a year, feeling neither fully painful nor completely painless. She had a cough producing phlegm and experienced body heat. Upon diagnosis, her pulse was weak, rapid, and lacking strength. Although her vital energy was weak, the evils had not been entirely dispelled. With reasonable treatment, adjustment was possible. First, she was given Xiaoyao Powder with added Cyperus and Fritillaria for over ten doses, which gradually alleviated her cough and the alternating chills and fever. Then, she received Eighth Treasure Decoction with additional Cyperus, Moutan Root, Bupleurum, and Polygala for over ten doses, which reduced her body heat by about eighty to ninety percent. Following this, she took a nourishing Qi decoction with added Aged Tangerine Peel and Wood Fragrance for more than two months. Her chest and diaphragm felt relieved, belching became comfortable, her appetite gradually improved, and her skin began to glow. For the external lump, a paste of Asafoetida was applied to resolve the mass, and after more than six months, it disappeared.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>A woman had pain in her right breast, swollen like a bowl. Upon diagnosis, her pulse was rapid and strong, indicating an excess condition and the desire to form pus. She was given the Tuo Li Xiao Du San, and after several doses, the swelling and pain increased; subsequently, she was needled, and about a bowl of pus was discharged. Then, she was provided with the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Xiang Fu added, and after over ten doses, she felt at ease.</p>
<p>A woman became enraged suddenly, experiencing hardness and pain in her left breast. She took two doses of the Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin, which slightly relieved the pain, but the lump and swelling did not subside. She continued to use a cooling remedy to dispel toxins, but the pain and swelling worsened, and her physical condition weakened daily. Upon examination, her pulse was floating and rapid but weak, indicating a deficiency of true qi and an excess of pathogenic qi, necessitating tonification. She received four or five doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang, which caused the swelling to first rise and the cold and heat to diminish; after over ten doses, the pus burst, and she continued with the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang for two months until she recovered. This was not solely the work of tonification. How could her illness have been cured otherwise?</p>
<p>A person had a tubercle in their left breast, which had taken three years to become swollen and painful. Upon diagnosis, their pulse was tight and rapid yet strong, indicating an excess of Yang and a deficiency of Yin. Moreover, the lump was as hard as stone, with the skin and flesh appearing purple and lacking luster, indicating a case of breast cancer. They refused treatment and ultimately passed away.</p>
<p>Another woman had a lump in her left breast, varying in size from small to large, soft to hard, all without pain. After more than half a year, the swelling developed into a bowl-like shape, hard and painful like wood, near the nipple, with multiple nodules appearing, sometimes painful and sometimes itchy. Upon diagnosis, her pulse was string-like and rapid, and the swollen skin was dark and lifeless. This indicated that the qi and blood had already died, and treatment was not advisable.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

<p>The breast belongs to the Yangming meridian, while the nipple belongs to the Jueyin meridian. When toxins caused by shock and depression accumulate in the breasts, they form abscesses. At the onset, within two to three days, use deer antler powder mixed with wine for internal intake and apply golden hoop powder mixed with honey water externally. If there is no improvement, urgently use Jingfang Baidu Powder with added (grass tongue) loquat seeds and ground flower powder. If this does not disperse the condition, take internal prescriptions like Tuo San with white peony root and honeysuckle. </p>
<p>External blowing on the breast is due to the child sucking and blowing wind inside. Internal blowing occurs when a woman is pregnant, and the fetus&#39;s movements create wind outside. In decocting herbs, it is essential to include protective medicinals to treat both lactation and breast conditions simultaneously. </p>
<p>Soapberry powder is used to treat breast abscesses and pain. Use one soapberry burned to ash, three qian of clam powder, and one qian of frankincense ground into powder, mix with wine and apply by rubbing the breast until it disperses; externally, use golden hoop powder for application, or internally take Re-Yuan Tongqi Powder.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those who have ruptured, use ginseng, astragalus, fritillaria, and white atractylodes. As for young women aged fifteen or sixteen, their meridians may be developing, sometimes menstruating once or twice a month, or not at all for over a month, leading to this affliction. They often have insufficient energy and weak vital qi, so it&#39;s advisable to take the Baidu San with added rehmannia and then take the Huangfan pill; its toxins will disperse without endangering life. If there is only one nodule in the breast, it can be treated, but if there are three or four connected, it is difficult to cure. Treatment methods include Xiaoyao Decoction to regulate menstruation, and a potion to open the flow of qi, relieve stagnation, and detoxify, adjusted as necessary.</p>
<p>Breast lesions are primarily due to yin being extreme and yang declining; without yang, how can blood disperse? This leads to blood seeping into the heart channel, causing the ailment. If not yet ruptured, treatment is possible; if ruptured, it is difficult to heal. The texture feels like a mountain rock, hence the name. If treated early, there is hope for recovery; if delayed, it can lead to internal decay and possibly death from organ failure. If not ruptured, use the Quandu Flow Qi Decoction with added safflower, sappan wood, fresh rehmannia, cooked rehmannia, citrus peel, angelica, woot, licorice, and little bupleurum.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Women’s Good Remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Breast Diseases</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s milk is transformed from qi and blood. When the vital energy is weak, the milk produced after giving birth is insufficient. In the early stages of giving birth, if the breasts are hard and swollen, this indicates that the milk has not yet flowed; if the milk is expelled with anger, this pertains to liver channel wind-heat; and if there is a lack of milk after multiple births, this indicates an internal loss of fluids. Breast milk relies on the Chong and Ren channels. If a woman is ill in these channels and has less yellow milk, she may be weak and prone to illness. </p>
<p><em>Note: If the signs indicate that qi and blood are weak and cannot transform into milk, it is advisable to strengthen the spleen and stomach; if the liver and gallbladder are disturbed by anger and lead to swelling, it is advisable to clear the liver fire. Milk is transformed from qi and blood: above, it becomes milk; below, it is part of the channels. If a woman repeatedly gives birth without producing milk, or if there is constipation, one should nourish the source of digestion.</em> </p>
<p><em>According to &quot;The Great Compendium&quot;: All cases of women’s milk either flowing or not flowing result from weak qi and blood and unregulated meridians. Milk should not be allowed to fall to the ground, as insects and ants may consume it, leading to a lack of milk. If the breasts are full, it is good to sprinkle it on the eastern wall. There are cases where after giving birth, milk must be produced. If the milk is engorged, but after childbirth it is insufficient, this often occurs in younger individuals whose milk production is influenced by wind-heat; thus, it is necessary to take clearing and beneficial medications for the milk to flow.</em><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If, after giving birth, a woman has no milk, it is due to the lack of bodily fluids, and she should take nourishing medicines to stimulate milk production. If she has some milk but not enough, she should take medicines to regulate her menstruation to promote it, still using soup to aid this. Indeed, a woman’s milk is supported by the connection between the Chong meridian and the Stomach meridian. Women who have given birth multiple times and have consistently abundant milk are also those whose blood and Qi are not depleted.</p>
<p>If milk flows out on its own after childbirth, it indicates a deficiency of stomach Qi, and she should take restorative medicines to stop it. If there is an excess of milk accompanied by pain and fullness, she should apply a warm cloth to relieve the discomfort. If milk flows out before childbirth, it is called &#39;milk weeping,&#39; and it often leads to infertility.</p>
<p>Note: For the above conditions, if both Qi and blood are deficient, use the Recipe for Complete Nourishment. If there is heat in the Liver meridian, use the Modified Ease Powder. If there is anger affecting the Liver meridian, use the Four Herbs, Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Gardenia. If Liver and Spleen are stagnated by anger, use the Modified Return to the Spleen Decoction.</p>
<p>According to &#39;The Great Compendium&#39;: For milk flowing out after childbirth, it can also be treated with the Loose Reeds Powder.</p>
<p>Milk stasis after childbirth occurs when the infant&#39;s sucking creates pressure that obstructs milk flow, leading to swelling and pain. If untreated, it may develop into an abscess. Swiftly take the (herbal) Decoction and apply Nanxing, and also manually massage to relieve it. </p>
<p>Note: For the above conditions, it is crucial not to damage the Qi and blood; treatment experiences should be referred to for issues like milk abscess and milk stone.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the &quot;Great Comprehensive,&quot; when postpartum lactation obstruction occurs, it is due to the child having eaten and then suddenly falling asleep, which leads to blocked air flow, irregular milk leakage, accumulation within, resulting in swelling and hardness. This obstructs the milk ducts, causing fluids to stagnate, resulting in pain from inflammation; there may also be swelling that is hard like stone, known as &quot;lactation obstruction.&quot; If not treated urgently, it can develop into an abscess; postpartum lactation obstruction requires immediate treatment. If not, it may lead to an abscess that can be fatal. One should take soapberry powder and other relevant remedies, applying the Tianshan star powder, and massage it to disperse.</p>
<p>Lactation jealousy arises when the child cannot drink, causing remaining milk to accumulate and result in swelling and pain. If the nipple is not stimulated for suckling, it will inevitably lead to an abscess. If there are sores caused by soaking, it is called &quot;lactation jealousy.&quot; In such cases, it is advisable to use red dragon skin decoction, Tianma decoction, Feiwu balm, and Feiwu powder, applying Huanglian powder as a poultice. </p>
<p>It is noted that if a mother has excess milk or the child has not drunk enough, leading to swelling and pain, stir-fried barley malt should be decocted, which will disperse the milk. If sores have formed, it should be treated according to the principles for lactation abscesses. If the skin has soaked and resulted in sores, the original method should be applied.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Great Comprehensive,&quot; &quot;lactation jealousy&quot; occurs postpartum when the child has not been able to drink, or when milk does not leak, or when the milk is swollen and squeezing does not yield adequate milk. All these lead to the milk and blood energy clashing, resulting in strong heat and intense thirst, causing pain that prevents hands from getting close.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

This is attributed to the liver and spleen being obstructed by anger, leading to a deficiency in qi and blood, and is termed &quot;breast stone,&quot; which is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: For pain from cold and heat, one should promote sweating to dispel evils; if there is significant swelling and pain, one should soothe the liver and clear the stomach; if there is no pus, but pus forms without bursting, one should use substances to expel it; if tissue is not regenerating, with thin and clear pus, one should replenish the spleen and stomach; if pus emerges with renewed pain and symptoms of chill and fever, one should tonify qi and blood; if there is swelling, pain, and internal heat in the afternoon, one should nourish yin and blood; if there is diminished appetite with occasional vomiting, one should tonify stomach qi; if digestion is difficult, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain, one should tonify spleen qi; if there is swelling and pain due to overwork, one should replenish qi and blood; if there is swelling and pain due to anger, one should nourish liver blood. </p>
<p>One must be cautious not to use harsh medicines that deplete and harm the spleen and stomach.

<p><strong>Methods of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For women who do not produce milk from birth, no treatment is necessary. However, if the condition arises from crying, sadness, anger, or grief that leads to blocked energy and closed channels, causing milk flow to be impeded, one should use clear broth from fatty pork to harmonize with nourishing foods. After feeding, take five to seven qian of a herbal powder and consume it continuously for three to five doses. Additionally, use a wooden comb to comb around the breast area over a hundred times, which should promote milk flow.</p>
<p>Another method involves consuming broth made from pig’s trotters along with tasty dishes, which can stimulate milk production. Eating four cooked pig trotters may also be beneficial.</p>
<p>If there is pain and swelling in the breast, this is also produced from the heart; it is commonly referred to as &quot;blowing milk.&quot; &quot;Blowing&quot; refers to wind. When the wind and heat obstruct the breast area, the blood vessels become stagnant, and over time this leads to festering and pus formation. A specific method can be used to counter this. The incantation goes: &quot;Carefully call upon the Eastern Protector to dispel this ailment.&quot; When using this method, first ask the patient what ailment they have. The patient will respond: &quot;It’s blowing.&quot; Take a breath and blow onto the marks on the palms of both hands while firmly pinching them with the thumbs. Stand facing north and recite the incantation seven times while blowing in that direction, repeating this process three times. When performing this method, have two women stand facing the patient and massage the painful area of the breast one to two hundred times. Repeating this process three times should result in improvement. </p>

<p>Causes of Illness</p>
<p>Mastitis is often caused by phlegm from thick, rich foods and damp heat, which accumulates between the diaphragm and interacts with stagnant milk to form the condition. It can also arise from milk stagnation caused by the child&#39;s breath and boasting, or from suppressed anger leading to stagnation. Calcined gypsum, burnt birch bark, (wild) vines, licorice root, and green peel are all highly effective medicines. If women treat this condition early, it can be resolved quickly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The woman’s breast, like the man’s kidney, is essential to life. Those suffering from excessive thirst and vomiting are experiencing heat in the gallbladder and stomach; if severe, it can lead to toxic qi rising and obstructing the throat and diaphragm, indicating liver dysfunction. These are all external symptoms, best treated with Jin Zheng Qi San combined with Tian Hua Fen, which can alleviate thirst and vomiting, and stabilize cold and heat. If there is obstruction in the throat and diaphragm, use Gan Ju Tang with fresh ginger, or Hu Xin San. If these four symptoms appear after an abscess, it indicates deficiency. </p>
<h3>Discussion on Evidence and Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>Breast tuberculosis arises from indulging in heavy foods, anger, and worries, leading to stomach fire boiling over into the breasts, transforming the milk into turbid pus, with liver qi stagnation causing blocked ducts, resulting in persistent and unbearable swelling. Initially, it is advisable to use the garlic isolation moxibustion method, strictly avoiding needles or knives. If the patient can drink, administer one part of drunk cow fat with Chuanxiong and Angelica, taken once or twice for effectiveness. If the patient cannot drink, use Lou San. </p>
<p>Tuberculosis can also result from weak qi and blood, slightly impacted by external and internal injuries, causing phlegm and fluid to congeal; this should primarily be treated with Gu Zhi Bei San. For blood deficiency, add Si Wu Tang, with additional Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma. For qi deficiency, incorporate Si Jun Zi Tang, adding Chuanxiong, Angelica, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma. For those whose spleen is damaged by worry, use Gui Pi Tang with Lou Gen, Fritillaria, Bai Zhi, Lian Qiao, and licorice pieces, boiled with equal parts water and wine.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment Methods for Breast Abscess</strong></p>
<p>For breast abscesses and nodules that arise from sudden anger or swelling and pain caused by a child&#39;s breath, one should soothe the liver and move Qi. If there is pain with cold and fever, it is necessary to dispel surface pathogens. If the swelling and pain are severe, one should clear the liver and detoxify. If there is no pus yet, soothe the liver and move Qi. If there is no pus formation or it does not rupture, focus on expelling pathogenic factors. If it has ruptured but does not heal or if the pus is clear, one should greatly tonify Qi and blood. I have often seen patients demanding quick results or not regulating their emotions and applying treatments without differentiating between deficits of meridians and realities; these cases are difficult to treat. Generally, cases beyond forty years old are particularly challenging because it is due to the depletion of Yin and blood. Generally, the breast corresponds to the Yangming Stomach Meridian, while the nipple corresponds to the Jueyin Liver Meridian. If anger harms the liver or rich foods accumulate heat, Qi will be obstructed, leading to blocked channels and inability to lactate, resulting in swelling and pain. If the blood heat in Yangming is severe, it will deteriorate into necrosis and pus.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>Breast lumps are caused by emotional disturbances, and they indicate a deficiency of blood and qi in the liver channels. It is advisable to use medicines to replenish qi and blood and to resolve stagnation. Generally, emotional stress causes obstruction of spleen qi and reversal of liver qi, leading to the formation of hidden lumps that are neither painful nor itchy, which many people overlook and find difficult to treat. </p>
<p>If any such condition arises, one should avoid emotional stress, stay away from rich foods, alleviate stagnation, and further treat with medications that nourish blood and qi, which may help preserve health; otherwise, it may lead to serious consequences.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Breast diseases are governed by the Stomach meridian of Yangming and related to the Liver meridian of Jueyin. When the mother of the breast cannot nurture properly, it leads to turbid gastric juices becoming stagnant and forming pus. Moreover, emotional distress can harm the liver, causing Qi stagnation and swelling. Initially, there will be symptoms of thirst and vomiting, with alternating chills and fever, and significant swelling and pain; this should be treated with a Burdock Seed Decoction. If excessive rich foods and anger provoke liver fire leading to swelling, one should use a Tangerine Leaf Powder to disperse it. Moreover, emotional distress can harm the liver, while excessive thinking can harm the spleen. When thoughts accumulate in the heart and desires remain unfulfilled, it results in blockages in the meridians, forming nodules that begin the size of a bean and gradually grow like a chess piece. Over six months to three years, they may be painless, progressively enlarging; eventually, they become painful and will not resolve. Later, the swelling resembles a heap of chestnuts or an overturned bowl, with dark purple and foul discoloration, eventually leading to ulceration. Deeper formations may resemble caves, while higher ones might look like floating lotus, causing severe pain that connects to the heart and results in blood and foul discharge.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At that time, all the five organs were weakened, and the four elements could not help; it was named &quot;milk tumor.&quot; Anyone who suffers from this will surely die. If recognized early, one may only use the Clearing the Liver and Resolving Depression Decoction or the Qi-nourishing and Vitality-restoring Decoction. The patient should further focus on calming the heart and nurturing, letting go of worries and hindrances, and taking medicine for adjustment; only then can one extend their lifespan. If a middle-aged woman without a husband contracts this, death will be even swifter, hence the saying that a husband is a woman&#39;s heaven. When the mass is first forming, prompt application of moxibustion on the tip is essential. The next day, when blisters form, they should be punctured; then, insert a thin needle to a depth of four fen, and place an ice vermin powder strip inside, sealing it up with paper. By the thirteenth day, the mass will fall off on its own. Use Jade Red Ointment to promote flesh growth and seal the opening, and continue to nurture to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>In the initial stage, redness, swelling, and pain occur, accompanied by slight chills and fevers, no dizziness, no dry mouth, and mild pain, which is favorable. Once it has developed, there is a burning swelling and heat, with intermittent pain, and if one sac has swelled without invading others, it is mild. If it has ruptured, with thick yellow pus, the swelling subsides and pain gradually decreases, and if it&#39;s itchy with new tissue forming at the edges, it is favorable. After rupture, if the pus stops naturally, swelling and pain dissipate, and new flesh grows easily, with the opening closing up quickly, it is favorable. In the initial stage, if one breast swells with hard pain, showing no redness, accompanied by chills, fever, irritability, vomiting, and inability to eat, it is unfavorable. If it has developed, showing no heat or redness, remaining hard like stone, with dry mouth, insomnia, chest fullness, and decreased appetite, it is unfavorable.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment of Breast Disorders</strong></p>
<p>For breast abscesses and nodules, if there is severe swelling, pain, and heat, and excess heat toxin, it is advisable to first treat them with a decoction of Lianqiao and Jinbai, which is very effective. If milk pours out after childbirth, it indicates that the Yangming stomach Qi is unstable; treatment should differentiate between the presence or absence of fire. If there is no fire and it continues to flow, it is due to Qi deficiency, and the Ba Zhen Tang or Shi Quan Da Bu Tang should be used. If there is excess blood heat in the Yangming causing overflow, Baoyin Decoction or Si Junzi Decoction with Zhizi should be used. If there is liver Qi stagnation with rising anger and breast swelling with overflow, the Jia Jian Yi Yin Decoction should be added. If there is a lot of swelling and pain with overflow, it is advisable to apply warm silk and disperse it. </p>
<p>For pregnant women’s breast disorders, termed &quot;internal wind,&quot; the cause is similar to that after childbirth, but medications should not harm the fetus. In severe cases of postpartum breast swelling, the Lianqiao Jinbai decoction is most effective.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Single Method</strong></p>
<p>When a woman is angry, overworks, or suffers from temperature imbalance, causing sudden swelling and pain in the breast: take a bowl and place four pieces of coarse lampwick inside, arranged crosswise so that each end protrudes about an inch. Cut a strip of coarse paper about one inch and five tenths wide, moisten it with water, and adhere it over the lampwick, ensuring the paper aligns with the rim of the bowl. Place the bowl over the swollen breast, leaving the ends of the lampwick exposed, and put a large round moxa at the bottom of the bowl before lighting it to perform moxibustion. Add more moxa as needed. Continue until steam escapes from the bowl&#39;s rim and the internal pain ceases. If severe, repeat moxibustion the next day, and it will surely diminish. [From &quot;The Canon of External Medicine&quot;]</p>
<p>For a woman&#39;s breast abscess in its early stages, swollen and painful but not yet filled with pus: pound two liang of dandelion roots and leaves into a paste. Combine this with half a pound of good wine, boil it several times, strain the mixture, and apply it to the swollen area. Consume the heated wine and cover up for about an hour; then use a cup of scallion white decoction to induce sweating, just enough to slightly sweat and disperse it. This method is excellent for rural areas where there are no medicines, and it is simple and effective.</p>
<p>Dandelions grow abundant in fields and along paths, blooming yellow flowers like chrysanthemums in March and April, with a sweet taste that detoxifies and disperses stagnation. It enters the Yangming and Taiyin channels. Wash it clean and finely grind it; boil it with honeysuckle vine to make a strong decoction, add a little wine to assist, and you will feel sleepy right away. Once asleep, you may miss the opportunity. [From Danxi]<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to &quot;Introduction to Medicine,&quot; for abscesses and similar conditions in women, first cover the area with warm paper. Wait for the paper to dry to mark the site of the sore. Then, take a whole garlic, cut off both ends, and slice the middle into pieces about three-tenths of an inch thick. Place it on the site of the sore and perform moxibustion on the garlic with an moxa stick. Change the garlic after every five sticks and repeat the moxibustion. If the sore has numerous heads, mash the garlic and spread it over the affected area, then perform moxibustion; replace the garlic when it fails. If there is pain, moxibustion should continue until the pain is alleviated; if there is no pain, moxibustion should continue until pain is felt. The sores will then diminish with the heat. This method removes repressed toxins and has the power of revival.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, sixty years old, with a strong appetite and prone to jealousy, experienced no sweating in summer and had a quick temper. Suddenly, a small lump, the size of a chess piece, formed in her left breast. It was painless, and she felt her spirit was not well. Unaware of the dietary factors for half a month, she took ginseng soup mixed with green peel and licorice powder, adding fresh ginger juice to sip delicately, five to six times a day. After five to seven days, it disappeared. This was the beginning of a condition akin to a rock; if not treated early, it could remain hidden for five to ten years. Without pain or itch, it would eventually break down beneath the breast, causing pus to ooze out like from a cavity. Alternatively, after five to seven or ten years, despite normal diet, it could lead to internal decay or death. Some could not be hurried by their husbands. Women regard their husbands as heaven, and losing that heavenly aspect can lead to such outcomes. It is called a &quot;rock&quot; because it resembles a hollow cavity, concealed externally but present within. To eliminate this requires prolonged duration. Hurrying a woman to treat it early effectively eliminates the problem before it takes shape. Others suffered death, more than ten cases. I also treated a newlywed woman with just green peel and licorice to stabilize her condition.</p>
<p>The record from Xue Ji&#39;s medical cases states: A woman had internal heat and tension in her sides, with both breasts occasionally painful and her mouth often spicy.

I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang combined with green peel, Huang Lian, and Shan Zhi for treatment, and she recovered.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had three lumps in her right breast that did not dissolve for over a year. She experienced morning chills and evening fevers, and found her food unappetizing. This was due to insufficient liver and spleen energy and blood. She was prescribed a tonic to restore energy and nourishment internally, and externally treated with aromatic cakes applied to the area. After more than a year, her energy and blood were restored.</p>
<p>Another woman had a lump in her breast for over a year, experiencing evening fevers and reduced appetite. I believed this was due to insufficient blood and energy and wanted to use the tonic, but she instead took a remedy to promote the flow of qi, resulting in the lump erupting with clear pus, leading to her demise. A third woman had a lump in her breast the size of a chestnut and took the same tonic; it grew to the size of a bowl, hard as stone, and she eventually bled out and died.</p>
<p>A woman over twenty years old, naturally weak, suffered from pain in her breast and headaches with a floating pulse. I prescribed a dose of Ren Shen Bai Du San with double the amount of ginseng. The exterior symptoms resolved, but her appetite remained poor and she had slight fevers in the afternoons. I combined Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Liu Jun Zi Tang, and after two doses her fever subsided and her appetite returned. I then used a formula to relieve the blockage, adding Chai Hu over ten doses; acupuncture was performed to drain the pus, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>In another instance, a woman with this condition had developed pus and feared acupuncture. As her condition worsened, I had to apply strong acupuncture, which resulted in about three bowls of pus being expelled. Her pulse was rapid and she felt thirsty. I administered more than thirty doses of a powerful tonic, leading to her recovery. Dan Xi stated: The breast is related to the Yangming channel, and the nipple belongs to the Jueyin channel. Jueyin refers to the liver, which is a critical area for women and where connected vessels reside. Initially, swelling may be severe, but typically only one or two sacs are affected. If pus forms and is not needled, it can lead to the rupture of various sacs. While the robust may still recover, the weak often do not, thus it is imperative to apply acupuncture before recovery can be achieved.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had a lump in her breast the size of an egg, which caused pain when she exerted herself and did not go away after a long time. She took herbal medicine without effect. This was a case of lactational disease caused by a deficiency of liver blood. Initially, I prescribed four doses of an effective herbal formula. After applying herbal moxa with garlic, the swelling reduced; then she took Ba Zhen Decoction, increasing the amounts of Xiang Fu, Xia Ku Cao, and Pu Gong Ying, while continuing the earlier formula. After a month, it disappeared. </p>
<p>There is also a condition known as mastitis, characterized by a hard swollen lump that does not rupture even if it breaks. This swelling also does not go down; in such cases, it is crucial to take the herbal formula and apply garlic moxa. These two conditions are caused by emotional strain and depletion of qi and blood, also classified as lactational disorders. One should avoid anger, regulate diet, and be cautious in daily activities; otherwise, treatment may fail.</p>
<p>A man had a breast boil with plenty of qi and blood, but the sore would not close and treatments were ineffective. I prescribed four doses of the effective herbal formula, which helped slightly; then I gave several more doses and treated him with a soybean paste moxa, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>One woman had a similar issue that hadn&#39;t ruptured yet and responded to three doses of the same medicine, leading to resolution. Liangfu mentioned that if there is a breast boil, taking this medicine immediately can stem the root of the illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, a concubine of the Guo family, was released from the palace at the age of forty. She had a hard nodule in her left breast that caused slight pain when pressed. Her pulse was weak and she spoke little, indicating a condition of stagnation, referred to as &quot;breast rock.&quot; It was necessary for her to take medications to resolve the stagnation and nourish her blood and qi, with a treatment of one hundred applications being able to ensure her recovery. Guo disagreed and instead took a formula called &quot;Ten Xuan San&quot; to disperse qi, which resulted in a worsening of her condition. After more than two years, she requested another examination. The swelling resembled an inverted bowl, solid like stone, with pus discharging like wash water. I noted that the pus was clear and her pulse strong, with symptoms of cold and heat, thirst, and despite treatment, she ultimately passed away.</p>
<p>Another woman suffered from breast abscess, experiencing chills, fever, and headaches. I prescribed a dose of Jing Fang Bai Du San; additionally, she was given a handful of dandelion, crushed, mixed with two to three cups of wine, and re-crushed. She drank the warm wine and applied the dregs to the affected area, resulting in reduction of the swelling. Danxi said: this herb disperses heat toxins, reduces swelling, and also dispels stagnant qi, acting as an effective remedy against toxic substances.</p>
<p>Another woman had a breast abscess and developed a fever after recovering. She did not respond to qi and blood nourishing medications. I gave her four doses of Ba Zhen Tang with added roasted dried ginger and then reduced the treatment, returning to the original formula with Huang Qi and Xiang Fu for over thirty doses, which helped stabilize her qi and blood.</p>
<p>Yet another woman had a swelling in her breast that did not form pus. I prescribed a formula for nourishing qi and promoting vitality with added Xiang Fu and Qing Pi for several doses, which led to the formation of pus. After needling, she improved within ten days.</p>
<p>Lastly, a woman had a swollen right breast accompanied by fever, feeling lethargic and overly sleepy, lacking energy to move.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman often experienced pain in her breasts and a prickling sensation in her mouth. Whenever she got up or lay down, she felt a pulling pain below her navel. She was treated with Xiaochaihu decoction combined with Qingpi, Huanglian, and Shanzhizi, and was cured.</p>
<p>Another woman, after giving birth to her second child, had no milk. After taking lactation herbs, she only felt bloated. I suggested that since human milk is transformed from qi and blood, the presence of bloating without milk indicated that her qi and blood were depleted and her fluids were lost. Therefore, she should replenish her qi and blood to naturally produce milk. I prescribed a modified Baizhen decoction with double the amount of ginseng and atractylodes, and a little more cinnamon. After twenty doses, her milk finally came in. However, due to subsequent labor, she became depleted again. </p>
<p>It was apparent that her initial milk had occurred in the first pregnancy, while the second pregnancy had yielded none, indicating that her qi and blood were only sufficient for one birth. It&#39;s understandable for some women to have persistent milk after childbirth, which is also due to qi deficiency, and such cases should be treated to stop the milk. If milk is interrupted and the child does not suckle, resulting in bloating, one can use malt powder ground into a fine powder and take it with warm water to disperse the bloating. If the child causes the nipple to crack and become sore, dandelion powder or a mixture of Huanglian and fat powder can be applied. For cracked nipples, applying clove powder, clam powder, or rouge can also be effective.</p>
<p>A postpartum woman engaged in labor suddenly experienced a surge of milk, feeling faint and expectorating phlegm. This was indicative of a deficiency in yang qi, causing a fainting episode. After administering Dushen decoction, she recovered, and further doses of Shiquan Dachuan decoction stabilized her condition. If a woman has an abundance of qi and blood but experiences swelling in her breasts, sometimes without the child suckling, accompanied by swelling pain and aversion to cold with fever, using two or three taels of malt, fried until cooked, and decocted in water will immediately relieve the condition. This illustrates the consumption of blood and qi. What if the spleen and stomach are weak, and the diet is not properly digested? One should use these herbs more liberally in the formula.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman who had just given birth had a history of excessive liver heat and suffered from a condition of damp-heat sores, characterized by internal itching and pain, reduced appetite, thirst, and frequent urination. She was treated with a modified Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Tang, along with Aloe vera pills and a wash made from herba Hedyotidis, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman, due to insufficient milk, took medicine to promote lactation, which resulted in swollen breasts, fever, and thirst. I thought this was due to deficiency of blood and qi, so I treated her with Yu Lu San, which led to her recovery.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment,&quot; in the year of the Lunar Calendar Gengwu under the Longqing reign, I returned from autumn examinations to find that my deceased sister had fallen ill. Her condition began back in July with breast swelling and pain that did not dissipate. In August, a doctor used fire needles to draw out pus; they administered Shi Quan Da Bu Tang and externally applied Tie Hu San, but this was ineffective and instead caused coughing and shortness of breath. By September, she gave birth to a daughter, but the sores enlarged and her breasts became entirely rotten, extending to her chest and armpits, with thick, sticky pus, totaling around six to seven liters, with no signs of healing. </p>
<p>In November, I finally returned to consult doctors, who changed her treatment to detoxifying and harmonizing remedies, and externally added Sheng Ji San, dragon bone, and cold-water stone. The pus continued to flow profusely, splattering everywhere, and the swollen areas began to burst, with ten or more dark purple sore openings on both sides, and swelling and rot extending to her chest and limbs, rendering her unable to move to one side; her condition was alarming. I believed postpartum toxins had risen unchecked and suggested she take more Astragalus to detoxify, nourish blood, enhance qi, and promote flesh regeneration, but the doctors dared not administer it.</p>
<p>By mid-December, her condition worsened, with over twenty ulcer openings, and all tested medications were ineffective, prompting me to use my own remedies. At the time, the pus was foul and sticky, so I prepared a soup from pig trotters to wash her, which provided immediate relief.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

The sweet and warm properties of Huangqi serve as the main ingredient to expel pus and invigorate qi in the muscles; Licorice supplements the stomach qi and detoxifies, while Angelica harmonizes the blood and serves as a subordinate. The herbs Shengma, Gegeng, and Louluren act on the Yangming meridian, and Lianqiao and Fangfeng disperse blockages in the women&#39;s channels. The herbs Louren and Shuzanzhi detoxify and reduce swelling, while Zaogao Thorn guides to the point of suppuration. Baizhi is added to expel pus and promote tissue growth in Yangming. Additionally, three parts of Chuanxiong, along with some Cinnamon and Stir-fried Licorice for their guiding properties, are included; each dose is prepared with a cup of wine and boiled to create the Baiyushuang pill, which helps to clear pus and detoxify. When the pus is thick and sticky, methods to stop it suddenly should not be used; instead, one ought to pursue it, adding Cuiren&#39;s powder externally. The next day, if the pus becomes thin and the pain diminishes, it indicates a tendency towards recovery. By the new year of the Xinwei year, signs of recovery with new tissue forming are evident in purple swelling areas. The scallion compress method is used to disperse it as needed, but for areas near the armpit and feet where the Shaoyang meridian is still not fully resolved, an additional amount of Chaihu (one qian) and Qingpi (three parts) along with double the amount of Chuanxiong are added. When the pus is almost cleared, a poultice of soupu powder is applied, and after the Lantern Festival, complete recovery is achieved.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

When the vital energy is weak, the milk produced after giving birth is insufficient. In the early stages of giving birth, if the breasts are hard and swollen, this indicates that the milk has not yet flowed; if the milk is expelled with anger, this pertains to liver channel wind-heat; and if there is a lack of milk after multiple births, this indicates an internal loss of fluids. Breast milk relies on the Chong and Ren channels. If a woman is ill in these channels and has less yellow milk, she may be weak and prone to illness. *Note: If the signs indicate that qi and blood are weak and cannot transform into milk, it is advisable to strengthen the spleen and stomach; if the liver and gallbladder are disturbed by anger and lead to swelling, it is advisable to clear the liver fire. Milk is transformed from qi and blood: above, it becomes milk; below, it is part of the channels. If a woman repeatedly gives birth without producing milk, or if there is constipation, one should nourish the source of digestion.* *According to \"The Great Compendium\": All cases of women’s milk either flowing or not flowing result from weak qi and blood and unregulated meridians. Milk should not be allowed to fall to the ground, as insects and ants may consume it, leading to a lack of milk. If the breasts are full, it is good to sprinkle it on the eastern wall. There are cases where after giving birth, milk must be produced.

Indeed, a woman’s milk is supported by the connection between the Chong meridian and the Stomach meridian. Women who have given birth multiple times and have consistently abundant milk are also those whose blood and Qi are not depleted. If milk flows out on its own after childbirth, it indicates a deficiency of stomach Qi, and she should take restorative medicines to stop it. If there is an excess of milk accompanied by pain and fullness, she should apply a warm cloth to relieve the discomfort.

If there is anger affecting the Liver meridian, use the Four Herbs, Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Gardenia. If Liver and Spleen are stagnated by anger, use the Modified Return to the Spleen Decoction. According to 'The Great Compendium': For milk flowing out after childbirth, it can also be treated with the Loose Reeds Powder.

If not, it may lead to an abscess that can be fatal. One should take soapberry powder and other relevant remedies, applying the Tianshan star powder, and massage it to disperse.

It is noted that if a mother has excess milk or the child has not drunk enough, leading to swelling and pain, stir-fried barley malt should be decocted, which will disperse the milk. If sores have formed, it should be treated according to the principles for lactation abscesses. If the skin has soaked and resulted in sores, the original method should be applied. According to the \"Great Comprehensive,\" \"lactation jealousy\" occurs postpartum when the child has not been able to drink, or when milk does not leak, or when the milk is swollen and squeezing does not yield adequate milk.

After feeding, take five to seven qian of a herbal powder and consume it continuously for three to five doses. Additionally, use a wooden comb to comb around the breast area over a hundred times, which should promote milk flow. Another method involves consuming broth made from pig’s trotters along with tasty dishes, which can stimulate milk production. Eating four cooked pig trotters may also be beneficial. If there is pain and swelling in the breast, this is also produced from the heart; it is commonly referred to as \"blowing milk.\" \"Blowing\" refers to wind. When the wind and heat obstruct the breast area, the blood vessels become stagnant, and over time this leads to festering and pus formation. A specific method can be used to counter this.

The patient will respond: \"It’s blowing.\" Take a breath and blow onto the marks on the palms of both hands while firmly pinching them with the thumbs. Stand facing north and recite the incantation seven times while blowing in that direction, repeating this process three times.

The blood of Yangming boils, resulting in significant heat and purulence. In cases where there is milk present, if phlegm accumulates in the diaphragm, the breath becomes hot, and the individual sleeps with milk in their mouth, heated air can lead to the formation of tuberculosis.

If there is obstruction in the throat and diaphragm, use Gan Ju Tang with fresh ginger, or Hu Xin San. If these four symptoms appear after an abscess, it indicates deficiency. ### Discussion on Evidence and Treatment Methods Breast tuberculosis arises from indulging in heavy foods, anger, and worries, leading to stomach fire boiling over into the breasts, transforming the milk into turbid pus, with liver qi stagnation causing blocked ducts, resulting in persistent and unbearable swelling. Initially, it is advisable to use the garlic isolation moxibustion method, strictly avoiding needles or knives.

Generally, the breast corresponds to the Yangming Stomach Meridian, while the nipple corresponds to the Jueyin Liver Meridian.

Insert the needle one inch and a half along the skin toward the back, then perform moxibustion to drain it. According to \"Introduction to Medicine,\" for abscesses and similar conditions in women, first cover the area with warm paper. Wait for the paper to dry to mark the site of the sore. Then, take a whole garlic, cut off both ends, and slice the middle into pieces about three-tenths of an inch thick. Place it on the site of the sore and perform moxibustion on the garlic with an moxa stick. Change the garlic after every five sticks and repeat the moxibustion. If the sore has numerous heads, mash the garlic and spread it over the affected area, then perform moxibustion; replace the garlic when it fails.

Unaware of the dietary factors for half a month, she took ginseng soup mixed with green peel and licorice powder, adding fresh ginger juice to sip delicately, five to six times a day. After five to seven days, it disappeared. This was the beginning of a condition akin to a rock; if not treated early, it could remain hidden for five to ten years. Without pain or itch, it would eventually break down beneath the breast, causing pus to ooze out like from a cavity. Alternatively, after five to seven or ten years, despite normal diet, it could lead to internal decay or death. Some could not be hurried by their husbands. Women regard their husbands as heaven, and losing that heavenly aspect can lead to such outcomes. It is called a \"rock\" because it resembles a hollow cavity, concealed externally but present within. To eliminate this requires prolonged duration. Hurrying a woman to treat it early effectively eliminates the problem before it takes shape. Others suffered death, more than ten cases.

Another woman, after giving birth to her second child, had no milk. After taking lactation herbs, she only felt bloated. I suggested that since human milk is transformed from qi and blood, the presence of bloating without milk indicated that her qi and blood were depleted and her fluids were lost. Therefore, she should replenish her qi and blood to naturally produce milk. I prescribed a modified Baizhen decoction with double the amount of ginseng and atractylodes, and a little more cinnamon. After twenty doses, her milk finally came in. However, due to subsequent labor, she became depleted again. It was apparent that her initial milk had occurred in the first pregnancy, while the second pregnancy had yielded none, indicating that her qi and blood were only sufficient for one birth. It's understandable for some women to have persistent milk after childbirth, which is also due to qi deficiency, and such cases should be treated to stop the milk. If milk is interrupted and the child does not suckle, resulting in bloating, one can use malt powder ground into a fine powder and take it with warm water to disperse the bloating. If the child causes the nipple to crack and become sore, dandelion powder or a mixture of Huanglian and fat powder can be applied. For cracked nipples, applying clove powder, clam powder, or rouge can also be effective. A postpartum woman engaged in labor suddenly experienced a surge of milk, feeling faint and expectorating phlegm. This was indicative of a deficiency in yang qi, causing a fainting episode. After administering Dushen decoction, she recovered, and further doses of Shiquan Dachuan decoction stabilized her condition. If a woman has an abundance of qi and blood but experiences swelling in her breasts, sometimes without the child suckling, accompanied by swelling pain and aversion to cold with fever, using two or three taels of malt, fried until cooked, and decocted in water will immediately relieve the condition.
