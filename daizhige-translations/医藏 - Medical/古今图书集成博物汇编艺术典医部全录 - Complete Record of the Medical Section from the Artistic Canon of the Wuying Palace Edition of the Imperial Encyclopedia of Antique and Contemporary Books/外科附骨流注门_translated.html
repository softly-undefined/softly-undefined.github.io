<p><strong>Surgical Section on Bone and Leaking Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Spiritual Pivot Classics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pus and Abscess Chapter</strong></p>
<p>When it occurs in the thigh and calf, it is called thigh and calf abscess. Its condition does not change much, but the pus grips the bone. If not treated urgently, death will follow in thirty days. <strong>[Commentary: This is the poison of the Foot Shaoyin. The condition not changing much indicates that the poison attaches to the bone and does not manifest outwardly, thus the skin does not show signs of an abscess.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>In the case of bone abscess, it is named so because it does not break, but rather the pus forms in the bone. It commonly appears in the joints of the limbs; in men and postpartum women, it tends to develop in the abdomen; in children, it often occurs on the back. For adults, if it develops quickly, they first feel pain and cannot move. Pressing on the bone will cause increased pain, and over time, the skin and flesh become increasingly tense and swollen, resembling a fatty condition. For a child, if they approach it with their hand, they will start to cry loudly, indicating pain in their joints. Adults with a slower onset will first feel a warmth in their muscles, and after a day, they will have a sense of pain and numbness. Children may be unable to move their limbs, also appearing as if they cannot be moved. Observing the joints, if there are warm spots in the muscles, and one does not recognize it as a bone abscess, it may lead to generalized swelling without breaking, and there can be a bluish darkening throughout the body. Adults may also misidentify it, calling it &quot;wind swelling,&quot; unaware that it is an abscess. Whenever a person suffers from heat in the body, seeking coolness from the wind can cause the wind to enter the joints; when wind and heat clash, it results in a bone abscess. The symptoms include drowsiness and a heavy feeling, along with intermittent ringing in the ears. Furthermore, sleeping exposed to dew in autumn or summer can lead to being affected by the cold, causing the wind and heat to congeal, resulting in this illness. In acute cases, heat is prevalent and wind is less, while in chronic cases, there is more wind and less heat. Not knowing how wind and cold contribute to this illness arises from the abundance of blood and softness of muscles, leading to the wind affecting them and causing congestion.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Whenever one first develops a bone ulcer, it is essential to urgently take Luolu soup and consume it. Applying a mixture of mung bean powder can help eliminate the ulcer, and one can also take a decoction of Wuxiang and Lianqiao. </p>
<p>For chronic ulcers that have deteriorated into deep ones, which often arise in the tibia and lead to sores, causing cold and stagnant conditions that prevent healing for years, they may develop into bone ulcers, also known as &quot;sore bones.&quot; These ulcers present as deep, rotten, and bluish-black, with firm and strong edges, and yellowish pus and blood exuding from the center, remaining unhealed despite numerous medicines. The discharge may worsen, the surrounding healthy tissue may become swollen and fragile, and fragments of bone may emerge. </p>
<p>In such cases, warm Red Dragon Skin soup is recommended, washing daily in summer and every four days in winter. For abundant unhealthy flesh, one can apply a mixture made with white (wild) lily powder to devitalize the bad tissue, repeating this application over three days. Afterwards, continue with a mixture of pig dung powder until healing is achieved. The ash from burnt pig dung should be ground into a fine powder and packed into the sore until thoroughly filled; when the white juice oozes out, it should be carefully cleaned, and the application changed as necessary until healing is complete. </p>
<p>If unhealthy flesh persists, reapply the white (wild) lily powder as before, accompanied by the pig dung mixture to balance the condition. For stubborn bone ulcers that do not heal despite a hundred treatments, one should apply moxibustion to the ulcer in a sequential manner; doing this for three days and nights can lead to healing. If the sore does not heal or recurs with bone protruding from an opening, it is called a bone ulcer. </p>
<p>In such cases, take a dead female crow, remove the flesh to keep the bones, and char them until they resemble charcoal. Obtain wood shavings from three cows’ horns, about one tael each, and burn them to ash, and then combine them to treat the ulcerated bone, as this will help in healing it.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Sores and Ulcers</strong><br><strong>[Song Dynasty - Dou Hanqing]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Flowing and Draining Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Blood sores associated with flowing and draining symptoms frequently occur in those who are heavyset and fond of eating fried, roasted, and sweetened foods. When the sore is large, it may resemble a chicken egg and appear like a purple plum, swollen but not red. It intertwines with the meridians and flows into the bones and joints, causing overall soreness and pain in every joint. For treatment, use an internal powder combined with papaya, white peony, and forsythia, and also take frankincense heart-nourishing powder and alum pills, along with applying a medicinal wrap externally. One should follow the indications cautiously and not rigidly adhere to formulas.</p>
<p>For small intestine flowing and draining symptoms that stem from heat in the heart channel and result in toxic accumulation, one should use &quot;Defeating Toxin Flowing Qi Decoction&quot; and follow up with &quot;Clearing Heart Flowing Qi Decoction&quot; for treatment.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Cold leakage and damp poisons can flow and gather; this poison may arise from scratching an itchy foot, leading to injuries from fire and wind. Alternatively, it may stem from cold dampness accumulating in the feet and lower legs, resulting in ulcers resembling cow&#39;s eyes, with surrounding purple and black discoloration, often exuding foul blood and water. First, use a three-edged needle to pierce around the wound to drain the blood completely, then apply golden thread ointment to draw out the toxic fluid and rotten flesh. Afterward, apply purple gold ointment, monitoring the ulcer until it reddens and becomes active again, then cover it with a protective paper ointment.</p>
<p>For symptoms of toxic flow, which occur due to irregular emotions, poor eating habits, food stagnation, or straining oneself with heavy loads, damaging the meridians, one should take herbs to dispel toxins and promote the flow of qi, such as the Decoction to Disperse Toxins or the Inner Treasure Thousand Gold Powder, alum pills, and Heart-Protecting Pills. This condition arises from an external invasion of wind, dampness, and heat, initially manifesting as one or two sores, gradually increasing to more, and potentially spreading all over the body. First, induce sweating to relieve wind and dampness, and then use ginseng and astragalus formulas for nourishment. Mix ginger juice and vinegar with the surrounding medicine. Next, take the Inner Treasure Thousand Gold Powder with increased amounts of ginseng and astragalus; during rainy weather, add aster root and alisma.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The bone abscess, also known as an abscess adhering to the bone, arises from attachment to the bone and meat, and while the terms differ, the affliction is the same. This condition emerges due to intense heat from summer, allowing pernicious wind to enter the joints, which clashes with the heat and is then countered by cold and dampness. It may also occur from excessive labor, standing in water, or sitting or lying on damp ground, combined with a weak body that succumbs to cold pathogens, resulting in wind and heat blocking and restraining, leading to the formation of abscesses at the large joints.</p>
<p>In acute cases, movement is impossible, and pressing on the area causes sharp pain deep within the bone. Over the course of days, there is a sensation of urgency in the flesh, swelling significantly. In mild cases, there may be slight soreness which gradually increases, making it difficult to walk, causing disconnection between bone and flesh. If untreated, the body may develop pus without draining, leading to a darkening of the skin and severe pain upon pressure, and over time this can lead to swelling and a transformed state resembling tuberculosis.</p>
<p>If the bone abscess persists, it may swell and develop pus, hence the distinction. When treating a bone abscess, if the malady is rooted in wind, the condition will be severe, with deep and abundant pus. Any signs of withering or cramping signify the gradual onset of a bone abscess. Symptoms include fatigue in the limbs, alternating chills and fever, reddish urine, difficult bowel movements, and absence of sweating.</p>
<p>To treat this, one should use perilla, wormwood, and balsamodendron decoction for hot compresses to open the pores, dry the area, and then cover with a dry blanket, followed by incense burning to aid in recovery. If there is severe weakness, ginseng paste should be taken, with a small addition of aconite to bolster energy, combined with moxa therapy, ensuring recovery without fail.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Zhenheng, Yuan Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>For Bone Abscess</strong>  </p>
<p>When pain occurs at the Huantiao point, take precautions against developing a bone abscess. Use astringent ingredients like Atractylodes (Cang Zhu) combined with bitter Huang Bai, along with QIng Pi to promote circulation. In winter, add Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and in summer add Huang Qin (Scutellaria). If the body is weak, include Du Niu Xi (Rehmannia) and use fresh Gan Cao (Licorice) to guide the treatment. Prepare a decoction, and add ginger juice before consuming it. </p>
<p>If the pain is severe and persists after several applications, add one or two packets of Ma Huang. If there is still no improvement and the abscess seems imminent, quickly dig a hole to make a basin, heat it until red, and pour urine into it. Sit in it while surrounded by mats to trap the heat and steam, allowing pores to open, promoting circulation, and healing the condition. </p>
<p>For bone abscesses, where heat is extreme in the blood, treat the initial onset with Qing Pi and Gan Cao; after the abscess has ruptured, it is essential to nourish the blood.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone abscess occurs when toxic gas deeply adheres to the bone. This illness resembles the effects of stolen wind, yet it is different; one cannot distinguish between them, leading to errors in treatment. Bone abscess typically develops when one exposes themselves to cold while resting in summer or autumn, where wind and heat become trapped, causing an abscess to form on the bone. The symptoms of stolen wind arise from the wind pathogen impacting the joints, causing deep pain in the marrow; this pain worsens in the cold. Bone abscess is characterized by pain that prevents movement. Initially, upon pressing the area, one may feel slight discomfort in the skin and flesh, resembling a swelling that is thick and full. The bone affected by stolen wind does not feel very hot, but is accompanied by a chilling sensation, and sweating may occasionally occur, leading to a constant desire to heat the painful area for relief. In the early stage of bone abscess, pain is intermittent and may fluctuate between cold and hot sensations without sweating. If it persists without resolution, the cold transforms into heat, ultimately leading to suppuration.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>When the invading wind is not treated, it can become twisted and withered over time, hence the differences. If one recognizes it as an invading wind, then taking the remedy for wind from the book &quot;Yue Bi&quot; will suffice. If it is recognized as a bone abscess, one should promptly take the decoction of reed and possibly use a five-spice lianqiao powder to promote a bowel movement, followed by the internal remedy &quot;Xingma Decoction&quot; and the application of a plaster for sores. Even if one cannot dispel it, some relief can still be achieved. </p>
<p>There are also slow abscesses, like stone abscesses and bone abscesses, which are similar yet different. The slow stone abscess is caused by cold that sinks deeply into the bones and marrow, appearing swollen like flesh, but is hard and painful as stone, hence the name &#39;stone abscess.&#39; The slow burrowing abscess has a lingering heat, takes days to form without rupturing, and eventually becomes dark purple with decayed flesh, thus named &#39;purple abscess.&#39; For both types, initial treatment should involve tonifying the deficiency and warming the body to dispel them. Subsequent treatment should be timely and adapted to the illness, thus no further details are provided.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Attached Bone Sore</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;thieving wind&quot; invades the bone marrow, thus its pain penetrates the bones; it worsens with cold. The external symptoms manifest as aversion to cold with sweating, and the painful area often desires heat application. If untreated, it may transform into contracture and atrophy. The remedy is Yuebì decoction. </p>
<p>For &quot;slow sore&quot; and &quot;stone sore,&quot; both are due to cold qi lurking in the bone marrow. However, slow sore presents slow heat, dark purple color, and after prolonged duration, both skin and flesh may decay; stone sore appears swollen and resembles skin, with pain as hard as stone. At the onset of both, warming and tonifying treatment is advised, followed by addressing specific symptoms as they arise. </p>
<p>Exterior infections caused by exposure to cold, dampness, or wind lead to the initial inability to move due to pain and a lack of sweating; prolonged cold can turn into heat, leading to constipation, treatable with Loulu Decoction. If there is a fear of evacuating, internal dispersing methods must be applied. For sores in the buttocks, use Qianghuo decoction internally; for swollen, hard areas near the knees, use Qichai decoction; for the outer thigh, use a wine-prepared decoction; for expansive, long-lasting swelling on the left outer thigh, which causes pain upon walking and pressing down to the bone, Huanglian Xiaodu powder is effective. </p>
<p>Universal remedies include Binsu powder and Baidu powder. </p>
<p>For internal injuries from rich foods, labor, and bathing in cool water after drinking, if pathogens invade the hip joints and affect the left and right huan tiao points, resulting in phlegm and blood stagnation, Qingcao Canglian decoction is recommended for mild sweating. If this is ineffective and fears of sores developing arise, urgently dig a pit, heat it with fire, and soak it with urine. The patient should sit bare-bodied over it, wrapped with a mat to contain the heat, allowing the steam to open the pores and achieve smooth circulation of qi and blood for healing.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Internal injury from cold drinks and food, as well as cold medicines, leads to blood stagnation inside. If one continues to eat as usual and has a slight loss of appetite, administer the Life-Saving Drink. For fatigue and reduced appetite, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Dong Quai and Agastache. </p>
<p>If internal injury is due to labor and there is swelling in the right leg, use the Middle Qi Supplementing Decoction. </p>
<p>For internal injury from overwork, with swelling and pain in both legs, insufficient appetite, this indicates damp phlegm accumulation. Utilize the Middle Qi Supplementing Decoction with added Pinellia, Poria, and Peony. </p>
<p>For internal injuries related to sexual activity, with hard swelling in both buttocks and urinary blockage, take Kidney Qi Pills with added Plantago and Achyranthes, and also use the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction; if there are cold and heat symptoms, use Xiao Yao San. </p>
<p>At the onset of a furuncle, it is advisable to prepare a decoction of Qing Pi and licorice root to promote qi flow, or apply moxibustion to the affected area. If pus has already formed, use a fire needle to prevent the toxin from bursting inside. Using fresh materials is also acceptable, as it causes no pain and helps close the wound.</p>
<p>For chronic bone swelling with a shiny appearance, mix equal parts of bee wax, snake skin, and hair ash into a powder and take three coins with wine; alternatively, form into pills the size of jujube, taking thirty pills with warm wine, while applying externally. If it has already ruptured, use Smooth Muscle Powder or burn dog skulls to produce smoke for fumigation. This method is also effective for fish eye sores. </p>
<p>For all cold and damp sores on the leg, use processed pigeon droppings as a powder to apply dry. If there is severe pain, add a little yellow lead and apply with tung oil. For any boils or abscesses appearing above the rabbit hole, do not treat.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Flow and Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Flow&quot; refers to movement; &quot;accumulation&quot; refers to stillness. Whether it forms as a lump or causes general swelling, it is all due to phlegm and fire. This can arise from external factors such as wind and cold, where the pathogenic energy flows to the site of phlegm and causes a reaction; or it can be due to internal emotional injuries, leading to a sudden surge of phlegm and fire; or from internal injuries related to reproductive matters, where a deficiency in yin leads to the invasion of yang energy, counteracting the body&#39;s natural processes; or from physical strain, where diet and activity cause disturbances; or from falls and injuries, where sudden obstruction causes stagnation and blood coagulation; or from postpartum convalescence, where retained lochia leads to further emotional distress and accumulation.</p>
<p>It generally occurs in the limbs or joints of the chest, abdomen, waist, and hips. Initially, one should use scallion compresses. For excess conditions, one can use the Sixteen-Flavored Flowing Qi Drink or Eight Herbal Decoction for dispelling toxins; for those with phlegm pain and constipation, the Ancient Half-Scale Pill. For deficiency conditions, one can use Er Chen Decoction, Si Wu Decoction, Tuo Li Yi Qi Decoction, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with the addition of Chuanxiong and Gui, or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Mu Xiang and Zhi Ke, tailored to promote natural resolution. If the condition has long persisted without improvement, even with external pathogens present, focus on Tuo Li as the primary method, using formulas such as Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, Tuo Li Yi Qing Decoction, Tuo Li Yi Qi Decoction, Eight Flavor Pill, supplemented with Dou Chi Cake and Amber Ointment, to dispel cold pathogens and restore yang energy.</p>
<p>If pus forms, it can be punctured with a fire needle, and internal pus channels can be treated with medicinal wires. However, excessive use of cold treatments is contraindicated.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Xuè Shì Medical Case Study</strong><br><strong>[Ming, Xuè Jǐ]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone abscess can occur due to exposure to cold winds while lying down, deeply affecting the bones; it can also arise from injury to the body&#39;s vital energy that prevents it from resolving; from overuse of depleting medicines that exhaust the original qi and inhibit recovery; or from applying cold medicines externally that lead to blood stagnation internally. For all these cases, it is advisable to apply moxibustion to the affected area to disperse toxic qi, replenish and revive the yang qi, and primarily warm and support the spleen and stomach. If one’s diet remains normal, first use the &quot;Immortal Formula for Reviving Life&quot; to detoxify and resolve stagnation, and then apply &quot;Six Gentlemen Decoction&quot; to nourish and support the vital qi. If one feels fatigued with reduced appetite, simply using the aforementioned decoctions will nurture the internal organs, preventing evil from overpowering the righteous. If pus has already formed, it should be needled to prevent the poison from invading internally; even using a live needle is acceptable. Using a fire needle does not cause pain and facilitates easier closure. Garlic moxibustion can detoxify and promote the movement of qi, while scallion poultices assist the yang qi and relieve stagnation. Although these methods are not found in formula texts, I have experienced significant efficacy from them, and their benefits cannot be fully recounted, but it should be noted that those with deficient qi and blood should not use them.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Flow and Confluence</strong></p>
<p>For issues caused by excessive anger leading to chest and diaphragm discomfort, regulating the qi is paramount; for conditions resulting from depression that do not cause pain, it is advisable to balance the meridians and replenish qi and blood; if there is swelling and hardness accompanied by pain, moving qi and harmonizing blood is necessary; if there is ulceration without healing, focus on boosting qi and blood; if remnants of cold damage still persist, harmonize and resolve it; in cases of spleen qi deficiency leading to damp-heat stagnating in the flesh, strengthening the spleen and eliminating dampness is crucial; for patients experiencing pain due to blood stasis from sudden injury, harmonize qi and blood and regulate the meridians; when cold evil strikes causing muscle spasms and bone pain, or pain throughout the body, warming the meridians and nourishing blood and qi is indicated. </p>
<p>The symptoms of flow and confluence often arise from emotional stagnation, whether from excessive anger, spleen qi deficiency, or dampness rebelling against the flesh; or the pores being insufficiently closed, allowing cold evil to invade the meridians; or due to phlegm dampness, or sudden injuries, or postpartum blood stasis affecting the joints; or from residual cold evil not yet resolved. All these stem from insufficient true qi, allowing evils to take advantage, leading to qi stagnation and blood accumulation causing affliction. </p>
<p>These symptoms may manifest in the limbs and joints, or in the chest, abdomen, lower back, or buttocks; they may present as lumps, generalized swelling, with or without pain. It is wholly appropriate to apply scallion compresses and administer restorative qi and nourishing essence decoction to consolidate vital energy. In such cases, those not yet fully developed will dissipate naturally, and those that have formed will break down on their own, potentially leading to full recovery. However, if one does not bolster qi and blood, neglects diet, is careless about daily living, disregards emotional balance, and only resorts to cold and cool treatments, none will achieve recovery.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>If there is a wound that does not heal over time, and the wound is not injured, it is advisable to use fermented soybeans or aconite cakes for moxibustion to dispel cold evil and replenish yang energy; or to apply amber ointment externally. If there are internal pus tubes or if there is excess flesh that does not heal, use a needle to disperse the necrotic tissue for self-healing. The use of a pill is particularly effective. </p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of flowing and swelling, they may arise from dietary indulgence, exhaustion, damage to the spleen and stomach; from excessive sexual activity leading to yin deficiency and an assault on yang energy; from the nourishing energy not following through and reversing within the flesh; from looser pores allowing external evil to invade; from rage damaging the liver; from accumulated stresses harming the spleen; from damp phlegm causing swelling; from trauma causing blood stagnation; or from postpartum lochia. All of these are due to stagnation of qi and blood. These can arise in the limbs and joints, or in the chest, abdomen, waist, and hips; they may present as lumps, diffuse swellings, or pain, all caused by deficit of original qi. It is advisable to use green onion poultices, along with nourishing qi and essence soup to secure the original qi. This will allow what has not fully formed to dissipate naturally, and what has formed to rupture on its own. </p>
<p>If there is a prolonged lack of healing, additionally use fermented soybeans and amber ointment to dispel cold evil and replenish yang energy. If there are internal pus tubes that do not heal, use a needle to disperse and dissolve them. The classics state: when the form is injured, swelling occurs; when the qi is injured, pain arises. It is also stated: if true qi is lost, there is deficiency; if evil qi is excessive, there is fullness. If one does not replenish qi and blood, regulate diet, take care in daily life, avoid the seven emotions, and exclusively use cold and cool remedies, then those who do not perish are merely fortunate. </p>

<p>The appendicular bone abscess is a sign of the failure of flowing energy. If cool herbs are used, they will internally damage the spleen and externally cool the blood. The spleen governs the muscles; if the spleen qi is harmed, appetite will decrease, and muscles will not grow. Blood is the network of vessels; if the blood is cooled, then the qi and blood will not be abundant and will stagnate. It is advisable to regulate the spleen; when the spleen is healthy, the blood will naturally generate, and the qi will run smoothly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the phenomenon of the white tiger flying corpse, lingering for cycles, sometimes lasting several years, where cold toxins decay the bones, eventually resulting in self-healing. If the bone becomes corrupted, it may recover, but if the bone truly rots, it leads to lifelong disability. Toxic swellings may arise from the hands and feet or head and face, accompanied by pain, extending to the neck and joints, like scrofula with pearls—this is a sign of wind and dampness blocking energy, and should be treated with modified Xiao Xu Ming Decoction and Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction.</p>
<p>There may also be swelling and pain in the knees, or pain in various joints throughout the body—this is called wind-damp bi, also known as rheumatic wind, and should be treated with Aconite and Eight Ingredients Decoction. Additionally, tubercles may appear in the neck, armpits, near the breasts, or in the soft flesh around the hips, referred to as &quot;disease lesions&quot; and associated with cold conditions.</p>
<p>In children, stagnation of phlegm may lead to tubercles in the neck, buttocks, chest, and back, which is also a cold condition, and should also be treated with warm herbs applied topically. </p>
<p>All of these symptoms arise from the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones; when the kidneys are deficient, the bones become cold and problematic. The so-called bone abscesses originate from the kidneys, as they have their root here. Therefore, using large Aconite to supplement kidney qi will ensure that when the kidneys are robust, the bones will be vital, and abscesses will not attach to the bones.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Proof of Treatment Guidelines</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Wang Kengtang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Affiliated Bone Carbuncle</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked how to distinguish an affiliated bone carbuncle. It is said: In cases of flowing pain, if the exterior is not fully resolved, residual toxins adhere to the bone and form a carbuncle. For those on the outer thigh, it belongs to the Yangming meridian of the foot, while those on the inner thigh belong to the Jueyin and Shaoyin meridians of the foot. Furthermore, it is stated: Wind and dampness, together with heat, lead to heat accumulation that adheres to the bone, resulting in carbuncles. The bone is associated with the kidneys; if the kidneys are deficient, the bones become cold, causing toxins to adhere to them. When bones are cold, qi becomes increasingly stagnant and accumulates, which can result in swelling but not pus. Flowing pain stems from the residual toxins of a febrile disease, whereas bone carbuncles are a complication of flowing pain. The flowing pain is not a fault of the febrile disease but rather an inadequacy in treatment by the physician. Bone carbuncles are not merely a consequence of flowing pain but rather an error by the inept physician in using cooling medicines. Additionally, it is mentioned: prolonged indulgence in rich foods, followed by drunkenness, exposure to water, or walking on ice or snow can lead to cold entering the hip joint, with phlegm and blood stasis interacting to form a carbuncle. Initially, there may be intermittent pain, fluctuating between cold and heat without sweating. Over time, the pain deepens into the bone and is persistent, with continuous tenderness upon pressure; this is the condition.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>At the initial stage, one should use garlic moxibustion; using more is better. It is essential to overcome the effects of the golden elixir and black gold powder that induce sweating. For those who are robust, one can take a single golden elixir or Eight-array Powder. If it continues for a long time, extreme yin generates yang, cold transforms into heat, leading to rotting flesh and forming pus. When the pus is formed, it is advisable to apply cauterization, supplemented by the Ten Perfectly Nourishing Decoction with added ligusticum and papaya for nourishment. </p>
<p>If there are long-standing toxic accumulations that linger and twist for over a year, resulting in rotten bones; even if the bones emerge, they do not heal and may lead to lifelong consequences. Observe whether the pus is white and thin: this indicates initial bone fragmentation and deep flesh is hard to extract; if the pus is white and thick: this indicates that the bone is about to emerge, and shallow flesh is easier to take. Overall, when long-term decay leads to bone exposure, regardless of strength, age, or weakness, one must provide nourishment to ensure that qi and blood flow harmoniously, restoring proper energy gradually, while dispelling evil energies naturally. The Ten Perfectly Nourishing Decoction and Ginseng Nourishing Decoction should certainly be used.</p>
<p>If pus has not formed, apply a harmonizing ointment because Duhuo can indeed invigorate the movement of qi and blood. If there is already an ulcer, it is advisable to take He Shou Wu Powder, as this medicine can harmonize yin and yang.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Flowing Injection</strong></p>
<p>If the discoloration is yellow and does not flow, it is commonly referred to as &quot;horse sickness.&quot; If it flows, it is called &quot;wandering flowing injection,&quot; commonly known as &quot;tendon horse.&quot; The external shape is slightly swollen, with severe internal pain at the joints, known as &quot;sucking bone horse.&quot; If there is pain in all the joints of the body, preventing one from sitting or standing, with no lumps and persistent heat, it is also referred to as &quot;sucking bone horse.&quot; If there are lumps appearing on the spine and hip bones, whether one or two or three to five in number, it is called &quot;over spine horse.&quot; If there are lumps with heat on the tailbone, it is called &quot;overstraining horse.&quot; If there is severe pain below the knee joint without lumps but with swelling, it is known as &quot;locked foot horse.&quot; If there is pain at the joints where bones intersect, with slight swelling but no lumps, it is called &quot;joint bone horse.&quot; This condition is due to wind and heat scattering through the limbs; treatment should focus on dispersing wind and relieving heat. Initially, do not use fire needles to cauterize; if swelling is severe, only puncture with a sharp needle. For chronic cases, cauterization with fire needles is acceptable. A flowing injection into the thigh is fatal. If remnants of cold damage remain, harmonization should be applied using Shen Qi Bai Du San, followed by Xiao Chai Hu Tang combined with Er Chen Tang, adding Qiang Huo, Chuan Xiong, Zhi Ke, Dang Gui, and Bai Zhu.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>For anger causing chest discomfort, focus on regulating the qi, and it is advisable to use the &quot;Flowing Qi Drink.&quot; For depression without pain, regulate the vessels, tonify qi and blood with &quot;Tonifying Qi and Nourishing Vitality Decoction.&quot; For swelling and hard pain, move qi and harmonize blood; &quot;Sore Department Flowing Qi Drink&quot; is recommended. If it ulcerates and does not heal, tonify qi and blood with &quot;Ginseng Nourishing Vitality Decoction&quot; or &quot;Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction.&quot; For spleen qi deficiency, with damp heat stagnating the flesh leading to a lump that does not hurt, where the color of the flesh remains unchanged and appetite is low, strengthen the spleen and eliminate dampness using &quot;Six Gentleman Decoction&quot; plus Chuanxiong, Angelica, Astragalus, White Peony, and Cinnamon. For hernia and stasis due to blood coagulation causing the patient pain, harmonize qi and blood, adjust the meridians, using &quot;Flowing Qi Drink,&quot; followed by &quot;Erchen Decoction&quot; combined with &quot;Siwu Decoction&quot; plus Cyperus, Lindera, and Platycodon. For cold evils attacking, causing muscle spasms and bone pain, or pain throughout the body, warm the meridians and nourish qi and blood with &quot;Great Danger-Preventing Decoction&quot; combined with &quot;Five Accumulations Powder&quot; and adding achyranthes and eucommia, or &quot;Duhuo Jisheng Decoction&quot;; also consider &quot;Siwu Decoction&quot; with Astragalus, Qianghuo, and Eucommia. If the illness still shows tidal fever indicating lingering cold, suggesting that the pathogen has not entirely dispersed, use &quot;Nourishing Wei and Returning Soul Decoction&quot; with dried kudzu, cimicifuga, perilla, Chuanxiong, and Duhuo, prepared in ginger water for drinking.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>If there is no heat or dampness, use Rongwei Reviving Decoction with Du Huo, boiled with equal parts of wine and water. For broken bones, use mountain centipede, white field shell, stone rattan, mountain ginger, nine-segmented incense, purple golden skin, and magnolia leaves to make a decoction, and apply it hot frequently. Afterward, take Continuous Bone Powder and Nine Gold Six Horse Powder. Prepare several small almond-sized kernels, called horse abscess or horse bell, and use purple golden bell, purple golden skin, purple river cars, and tian nanxing, ground with vinegar for warm application, along with purple golden skin, purple golden rattan, red internal eliminates, horse hoof fragrance, and horse hoof rattan decocted in wine for consumption. </p>
<p>For locked feet (neuropathic), use wild yam root, horse blue grass, li lu seeds, purple river cars, mountain loquat root skin, mountain bud gourd root, and purple golden skin, crushed and sautéed with salt, then applied. Additionally, wash with heated decoction and take Light Foot Powder and Nine Gold Six Horse Powder. For bone sucking (neuropathic), use mountain centipede, purple golden skin, stone rattan, white field shell, stream maple root, nine-segmented incense, and twisted golden surprise for a decoction to wash, then take Bone Sucking Powder, Nine Gold Six Horse Powder, and the Four Flavor Immersion Wine formula.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>For the treatment of &#39;Guati Ma&#39; (a term referring to a health issue), use the roots and peels of various herbs: mountain loquat, Chuanxiong, small zhang (Cinnamomum), Asparagus, Tian Nansheng, cactus, mountain vegetable gourd, red cow knee, pinellia, root bark of the mirabilis, mulberry flower, horse bluegrass, wild taro root, Tian copper branch, root bark of Wuyingzi, red peach root bark, and red xiong root bark. Crush them, mix with half vinegar and half water, warm and apply as a poultice, along with the &#39;Guati Ma&#39; treatment. Additionally, take &#39;Juanji San&#39; and &#39;Jiujin Liuma San.&#39;</p>
<p>For &#39;Guati Ma,&#39; use a higher quantity of mountain vegetable gourd root, red gezi root bark, camphor willow root, purple gold peel, purple gold trunk, crow&#39;s gun root, seven-leaf fragrant herb, tianhuafen (flower), pearl curtain root, white hibiscus leaves, mirabilis root bark, and stream maple root bark. Crush and apply after frying with salt. Another formula consists of mountain vegetable gourd root, gege root, purple river charioteer, licorice seeds, horse whip ear, purple gold peel, mountain loquat root peel, blood mulberry flower, crow&#39;s gun root, and white field branch, also crushed and applied after frying with salt. One more formula calls for mountain vegetable gourd root, purple gold peel, stream maple root bark crushed and then cooked in wine for application. This approach for &#39;Guati Ma&#39; is highly effective. Additionally, take &#39;Jiujin Liuma San&#39; and &#39;Four-Flavor Soaked Wine Formula,&#39; and also use the swelling wash and heat topical application.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>To treat the horse disease (inflamed area), use purple river vehicle, mountain loquat root skin, licorice seeds, mountain cucumber root, climbing vine root skin, Buddhist mulberry flowers, kudzu root, and stone moss, all crushed and mixed with vinegar to create a paste for sealing. Wash the swelling with the prescribed wash, and then take the Nine Gold Six Horse Powder and Jue Di San. For horses with the disease, if there is heat, use the heat-clearing powder; if there are exterior signs, use the Jingfang Baidu powder; if it&#39;s internal, use the internal clearing Huanglian Decoction; and if both exterior and internal signs are present, use the Zhua Ding Duo Ming Soup. Crush the Water Jin Feng and apply it to the kernel for effect. If the horse has heat that hasn&#39;t fully formed, administering the medicine can reduce it; if it has already formed, it is necessary for the pus to be expelled for the heat to dissipate. If there are four to five kernels present and only one or two have not formed pus while the others have, the heat cannot subside until all five have expelled pus. If it has ulcerated, it is considered an ulcer, and one should investigate and treat it at the source. </p>
<p>Fluid retention originates from cold damage, with lingering toxins flowing into the limbs and meridians, stagnating before leading to the fluid retention. If the patient still has intermittent fever, it indicates internal cold, and the pathogen has not been fully dispersed. The Rong Wei Fan Hun Decoction can be modified with the addition of Sheng Ma and Su Ye.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>If after taking this, the heat does not subside, you may add dry kudzu. If there is a headache, add Chuanxiong and boil it with ginger water. If there is no damp-heat, you may boil it with half water and half wine, as wine can promote blood circulation and vital energy. When energy circulates, blood flows, and recovery is assured. However, why should we address the surface issues? This is to trace the cause, explore its origins, and not forget the root of the illness. Once the cold evil is eliminated, if the surface treatment is excessive, it leads to cold retention, which is particularly difficult to treat, so a slight surface treatment is preferable. </p>
<p>After the surface treatment, in the second stage, it is advisable to take warm, neutral medicines, which essentially serve to replenish the interior. If this is ineffective, in the third stage, you should add Aconite or take the Si Zhu San for a few doses and then stop. Warm medicines should also not be overused, for fear of increasing suffering, which might turn into pus or blood that cannot be resolved. In the fourth stage, revert to the original formula to achieve results. However, if the surface condition is not resolved, lingering toxins may attach to the bones, leading to bone abscesses. </p>
<p>Flowing retention is the residual toxin from cold damage; bone abscesses are the failed manifestations of flowing retention. Flowing retention is not the fault of cold damage but rather the result of inadequate surface treatment by the physician. Bone abscesses are not simply a consequence of flowing retention, but also the fault of incompetent doctors who use cold medicines improperly. Incompetent doctors lack insight, are blind in mind and deaf in spirit, and falsely claim to have clear perception. Even if they recognize bone abscesses, they have no effective methods to treat them, relying instead on cold medicines and harsh toxic treatments, causing toxin stagnation. Cold medicines, when they encounter iron utensils, further attach to the bones and cannot resolve the issue.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Otherwise, how could the bones of a person have abscesses? When bones form abscesses, they cannot be treated with medicine, hence they are called &quot;bone-attach abscess&quot; and also &quot;tiger-flying corpse.&quot; If it lingers for a while, extending over several years, the cold poison decays the bone, and it may eventually heal by itself. Those that do not heal may persist for a lifetime; this is a failure from the outset. Many instances of bone decay involve accessory bones, which may still heal, but decay of the main bones results in lifelong disabilities. Therefore, when the pus is white and clear, it signifies that the shattered bone has just come loose, and the flesh is deep and difficult to extract; when the pus is yellow and thick, it means the shattered bone is about to come out, and the flesh is shallow and easier to access, thus it is advisable to use a sharp blade for extraction. </p>
<p>There are also cases of fluid accumulation as large as a gourd covering a bowl, seen on the chest or back, whose symptoms are similar to a fever; after using the nourishing and circulating herbal decoction, if there is even a slight change in condition, it is no longer a fever. It is suitable to use internal supplements as complementary treatments, with variations according to symptoms, to help eliminate the interior issues. Generally, fluid accumulation originates from cold, hence the pain is in the bones; the bones are a residue of the kidneys, and when the kidneys are deficient, the bones become cold, causing pain, as what is called &quot;bone abscess&quot; arises from kidney issues, rooted in this fact. Therefore, to nourish the kidneys, one must use great aconite to achieve the desired effect. When the kidneys are robust, the bones are vitalized, and abscesses do not attach to the bones. In all medicinal applications, one should not adhere to a single way, but rather value adaptability and change.</p>
<p>For cold conditions of fluid accumulation, it largely attaches within the bones, becoming hard and unyielding, with cold bones causing pain, and muscles unable to stretch or extend.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>If there is light use of knives or needles and no pus or blood, but only a clear flow of milk-like liquid, or if there is stagnant blood, this medicine should be applied. If the symptoms ease slightly, mix equal parts of military ginger, white angelica, cinnamon, and black grass, adjusting with hot wine for application; this will relieve cold in the bones and stop pain, leading to warmth in the qi, allowing the muscles to naturally stretch, and hard flesh to dissipate. However, when treating flowing and festering conditions, one must not be without wood wax to break the stagnant qi and dissolve hardened swellings which is most effective. But do not use too much, as excess can neutralize the medicinal properties, since this condition primarily requires warming medicines.</p>
<p>If asked about sores between the legs that resemble a cow&#39;s eye, either purple or black, with pus flowing profusely and decaying at the edges without healing for a long time, one should say: This is called damp toxin flowing sores; caused by violent winds and sudden rains that invade the pores and lead to this condition. It should be treated with a Fengfeng Tongsheng Powder combined with papaya, achyranthes, and the like, or with a Danggui Nian Pain Decoction with added achyranthes.</p>
<p>If asked about continuous pus between the knees that has not healed for years, one might say: This is referred to as lower sores, also known as damp toxin sores. This arises from damp heat in the spleen and stomach descending, leading to numbness in the muscles, resulting in sores. Externally, it belongs to the foot&#39;s Taiyang and Shaoyang channels, while internally it belongs to the foot&#39;s Jueyin and Taiyin channels. It is advisable to take Fengfeng Tongsheng Powder with papaya and the like, while externally using decoctions to dispel wind for washing, and applying leaves of the female privet.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Surgical Essentials</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong】</p>
<p><strong>Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone abscess, or &quot;Fu Gu Ju,&quot; arises from cold and damp invading the bones. However, if a person’s vital energy and blood are robust and healthy, even in the face of cold, malevolent forces cannot penetrate the bones. Those afflicted are generally individuals with weak constitutions, exposed to cold and damp while sleeping in summer and autumn, or those who have had intimate relationships covered with thin bedding, allowing cold air to enter their bodies through weaknesses, ultimately leading to this illness. Initially, symptoms include alternating chills and fever, resembling wind invasions. Subsequently, pain in the buttocks and legs ensues, without significant heat or redness, but with bone-deep pain; in severe cases, the affected cannot move or turn. Over time, the cold transforms into heat, worsening until flesh rots and turns to pus, indicating the abscess has formed.</p>
<p>For treatment, at the onset of chills and fever with pain, employ &quot;Wu Ji San&quot; with added &quot;Niu Xi&quot; and &quot;Hong Hua&quot; to induce sweating, dispel cold, and promote circulation. Alternatively, &quot;Wan Ling Dan&quot; can also be used for sweating. Follow up with &quot;Da Fang Feng Tang&quot; to invigorate blood flow, dispel dampness, and replenish vitality. In cases where the abscess occurs in the buttocks causing diffuse swelling and pain, &quot;Nei Tuo Qiang Huo Tang&quot; should be applied; for diffuse swelling and pain near the knee and thigh, use &quot;Nei Tuo Qi Chai Tang&quot;; and for the outer side of the leg, employ &quot;Nei Tuo Jiu Jian Tang.&quot; At the early stage, a universally applicable remedy is &quot;Ren Shen Bai Du San&quot; with added &quot;Mu Guo,&quot; &quot;Niu Xi,&quot; &quot;Su Mu,&quot; and &quot;Hong Hua.&quot; For those with deficiency, use &quot;Shi Quan Da Bu Tang&quot; with additions of &quot;Qiang Huo,&quot; &quot;Fang Ji,&quot; and &quot;Niu Xi.&quot; When an abscess is about to form pus, use &quot;Fu Zi Ba Zhen Tang.&quot;<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>For an abscess that has formed with swelling and pain, one should apply acupuncture. For thick yellow pus with a solid body, the formula &quot;Shiquan Dabu Tang&quot; (Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction) is appropriate. For clear white pus with a weak body, use &quot;Baoyuan Dacheng Tang&quot; (Great Achievement of Preserving Origin Decoction). For those with little appetite and fatigue, &quot;Xiangsha Liujunzi Tang&quot; (Aromatic Sand Six Gentlemen Decoction) is recommended. For cases of spleen deficiency with alternating cold and heat, &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Tang&quot; (Tonifying the Middle and Augmenting Qi Decoction) is suitable, as these formulas can help regulate the condition.</p>
<p>There are also cases of wind-dampness presenting as initially alternating chills and fevers, followed by leg swelling and pain, characterized by a smooth and slightly red appearance, accompanied by heat and swelling. If pressed, the area feels like mud and is difficult to move; in such instances, &quot;Danggui Nian Tong Tang&quot; (Angelica Pain-Relieving Decoction) or &quot;Fuling Zuojing Tang&quot; (Poria Assisting the Channels Decoction) should be used, intermittently paired with &quot;Wanling Dan&quot; (Universal Cure Pill) to enhance the treatment.</p>
<p>All the above conditions arise from insufficient vital energy and should not be treated with tonics that drain the spleen, expel energy, or weaken toxins, nor should cold and cooling methods be employed externally. Misuse of such treatments will surely lead to stagnant and congealed vital energy and blood, internal flesh becoming necrotic, which over time will turn into foul pus and drain uncontrollably, leading to fatal outcomes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for those whose condition arises from sexual exhaustion, experiencing alternating cold and heat, disharmony of vital energy and blood, and obstruction of the meridians, which deepens the disease, the affliction may cause the thigh to gradually swell as large as a winter melon, extending from above the hips down to the soles of the feet, resulting in diffuse swelling with skin that is not red. Over time, it may ulcerate with pus that is white and fetid, persisting swelling and unrelenting pain, leading to a decline in vital energy and body mass, with dry and scorched lips and tongue, and hard, secretive excretion. If various medicines are ineffective and food intake ceases, it will ultimately become untreatable.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>At the onset, if there is mild chills and fever, eating and drinking are normal, with slight swelling that is red and pain not reaching the bone, it is considered favorable. Once developed, if movement is easy, swelling forms into a pouch, pain occurs intermittently, and pus easily forms, it is auspicious. After it has burst, if the pus is thick, swelling reduces, pain lessens, the body feels light, and sleep is stable without fever, it is good. After bursting, if vital energy recovers easily, appetite returns quickly, internal flesh reinforces easily, and pus and water dry up easily, it is auspicious.</p>
<p>At the onset, if there are chills and fever, swelling is diffuse and pale in color, limbs are stiff, and pain reaches the bone, it is perilous. Once developed, if movement is inhibited, the leg swells diffusely, neither hot nor red, and does not produce pus, it is dangerous. After bursting, if the pus is thin and watery, with foul-smelling gas, swelling and pain persist, and the body continues to weaken, it is fatal. After bursting, if the spleen and stomach are weak, with no taste in food, persistent thirst, pale lips, and dry skin, it is fatal. </p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>At the onset, with fever and chills, a tight body, and swollen painful legs, the condition should be dispersed. Once established, with swollen painful legs and unchanged skin color, swelling throughout the body should be treated by dispersing cold and warming the meridians. If swelling is caused by alternating cold and heat, the affected area is white and shiny and feels soft like mud when pressed, the focus should be on strengthening the spleen and promoting fluid metabolism. If there is no fever, chills with a slow and thin pulse, and leg swelling without heat, one should nourish the blood and warm the meridians. In cases of summer heat with a rapid and strong pulse, swollen legs, dry mouth, and constipation, treatment should be about purgation. After the condition has erupted and there is clear, thin pus, decreased appetite, and weight loss, one should strengthen the middle and bolster the spleen and stomach. If, after eruption, swelling and pain persist, with continuous pus and unresolved deficiency heat, one should warm the middle and nourish qi and blood. After recovery, if there are tightness in the muscles and joints making bending and stretching difficult, one should nourish qi and blood to promote joint mobility.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Complete Book of Jingyue</strong> by Zhang Jieben (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Appendicular Bone Abscess Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as appendicular bone abscess is commonly referred to in modern terms as a bone abscess. Any abscess caused by deep toxic energy gathering at the bone interface can be termed as such. However, this condition particularly occurs in the thicker flesh between the thighs. The causes of this condition include injuries to the muscles and bones resulting in damage to the blood vessels, excessive indulgence in alcohol leading to depletion of the body&#39;s Yin, emotional distress and anger causing stagnation of Qi, and invasion by wind, cold, and dampness that obstructs the meridians. If a person experiences prolonged and unexplained soreness at the Hui Tiao point, it is a sign of this condition, and urgent treatment is necessary. </p>
<p>Initially, it arises from a slight blockage in the Shaoyang meridian; if this blockage does not resolve, it gradually leads to obstruction, swelling, and potential rupture. As it spreads, it affects all three Yin and three Yang meridians, leading to overall leg disruption. This condition fundamentally results from a significant depletion of the vital energy, causing stagnation that can lead to rupture, making it a serious condition. </p>
<p>If rupture occurs and the pulse is harmonious, although the patient may feel extremely weak, focusing on replenishing Qi and blood can ensure recovery. However, if after rupture the pulse is forceful and wiry, coupled with restlessness, fever, and thirst, then treatment is not advised. For treatment of this condition resulting from injury to muscles and bones, it is recommended to use a combination of the Da Ying Decoction and the Da Fang Feng Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>If alcohol or excessive emotions harm the body’s Yin, one should use Ba Wei Wan, Liu Wei Wan, or You Gui Wan along with Da Fang Feng Decoction. If anxiety, worry, or anger cause qi stagnation, one should use Chuang Ke Liu Qi Drink or Wu Xiang Lian Qiao Decoction combined with Da Fang Feng Decoction. If attacked by wind-cold from outside, one should use Wu Ji San combined with Da Fang Feng Decoction. Generally, if this condition arises, one should promptly use Da Ying Decoction to warm and tonify qi and blood, or combine it with Xian Fang Huo Ming Drink to expel toxins. </p>
<p>In cases of heat, one should quickly use Lian Qiao Gui Wei Decoction to resolve the toxins, and also quickly apply garlic moxibustion or bean paste cakes for direct moxibustion to rapidly disperse the toxins, which is the most effective method. If there are symptoms of damp-heat or phlegm accumulation, further treatment methods should be sought to avoid serious harm. </p>
<p>If there is persistent pain at the环跳 point or slight swelling in the hip and thigh, and it is judged to have formed, one must act quickly to nourish and strengthen the root, facilitating a quick rupture; if the base is solid, even if there are serious issues, the harm will be minimized, and it will be easier for it to burst, gather, and heal. If the pulse is slippery and rapid, pressing indicates it is soft and ripe, indicating pus formation; it is urgent to use acupuncture to prevent it from being retained for too long and causing deeper issues. </p>
<p>If one is unclear about the benefits and harms, pursuing immediate relief might involve methods that harm the root qi, or using cold and cooling medicines to suppress the toxic qi, leading to prolonged suffering and weakening of the root qi; this would result in an inevitable, uncontrollable rupture. Texts have not thoroughly detailed these conditions, so the underlying causes and treatment strategies are compiled.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>
<p>For treating sores with flowing Qi: This remedy addresses fluid retention resulting from internal heat, emotional stagnation, or accumulations that cause hard, painful lumps; it may also alleviate chest fullness or dampness from wind and cold, affecting the meridians; or blood stagnation forming lumps that remain a normal color; or widespread swelling that is heavy without a clear starting point; or symptoms like yin deficiency and lumps akin to breasts, whether they are beginning to fester or have already developed pus with unhealthy tissue.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Platycodon, ginseng, angelica, cinnamon, licorice, astragalus (fried in salt water), magnolia bark (prepared with ginger), perilla, white peony, lindera, saposhnikovia, bitter orange, betel palm, fragrant wood, chuanxiong, and angelica dahurica. </p>
<p>Direction: Boil with fresh ginger for oral consumption. For pain, add frankincense and myrrh; if the sore is dry, add anemarrhena and fritillaria; if not dry, add fried soapberry spikes; for fluid retention, include qinghao and duhuo; for Qi stagnation, add cyperus; for stomach deficiency, use aged tangerine peel. This is a formula for invigorating Qi and dispersing blood. If taken excessively, it may harm Qi and blood, leading to insufficient material for pus formation.

<p>Take the yellow dog&#39;s lower jaw and tongue, together with the skin and fur, and chop it finely. Place it in a jar with salt and clay, sealing it tightly with an iron lid. Burn a stick of incense; when the smoke becomes clear, stop. It is important to maintain the right properties, as over-processing will render it ineffective. The ash should be purely black to be considered effective; if it has white, it has been over-processed and should not be used. When preparing, grind it into a very fine powder.</p>

The left foot corresponds to the liver and spleen, originally located in the foot&#39;s jueyin liver channel, slightly encroaching upon the foot&#39;s taiyin spleen channel.

<p>For pain at the Huantiao point, to prevent the formation of abscesses: use a combination of Cangzhu and Huangbo for their pungency, activated by Qingpi; in winter, add Guizhi, and in summer, add a piece of Jiaozi Huangqin; for those with a weak constitution, add Tu Niuxi, using Sheng Gancao as the guiding herb. Decoct with major spices, and incorporate fresh ginger juice with a spicy note, to be consumed before meals. If the illness is severe, it might be necessary to add a couple of doses of Mahuang if Cangzhu, Huangbo, and Guizhi fail to take effect. If there is still no response, it may indicate that an abscess is about to form. Urgently create a pit in the ground, heat it with fire until red, pour in urine, and sit over it while wrapped in a mat to contain the lower body, allowing the rising heat to steam, thus opening the pores and promoting the flow of blood and Qi for healing.</p>
<p>For chronic abscesses that have deteriorated into bone issues: use powdered Longgu to coat the ulcer on all sides, to a thickness of two fen, applying a paste to the center of the ulcer, changing it twice daily. When the worms emerge like hair, it will completely heal. Paste formula: take one dead large toad, add a chunk of chaotic hair the size of a chicken egg, and one pound of pig fat; extract the essence from the first two and decoct within the fat until almost dissolved, then let cool before adding a handful of salt, mixing it with the previous ingredients for use.

<p>For bone ulcers that have persisted without healing, where pus continuously seeps and bone protrudes from the sore: Use one frog, hair from a chicken’s head about the size of an egg, and four taels of pig lard. Cook until dry and remove the dregs, wait for it to congeal like ointment. First, wash the area with a decoction of mulberry root and Aconite, dry it, and mix powdered dragon bone along the edges, then apply the prepared ointment. [Jin Nang]</p>
<p>For long-standing bone abscesses that release fluid with pressure: Apply melted sugar on the ulcer, then break live carp against it, scrape the area after a moment, wash again and reapply medicine, when the worms are gone, it will heal. [Zhou Hou]</p>
<p>For black pus from a bone abscess: Take one crucian carp, remove the intestines, fill with white salt and secure, then boil in a stone vessel with one cup of water until it’s dry and charred to a powder. Mix with pig lard for application; slight pain should not be a concern. [Wei&#39;s Method]</p>
<p>For bone abscesses: Burn dog skulls and let the smoke expose the area to sunlight. [Sheng Hui]</p>

<p>Medical Cases</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Li Gao&quot; mentions: Wang Shixiang from Pujin, aged seventy, was affected by cold damp from the ground. In February, he developed a bone abscess on the outer side of his left leg at the Lesser Yang point, slightly encroaching upon the Greater Yang region, measuring six to seven inches in width and one small foot in length, hard and swollen, with indistinct flesh color, skin deep, and painful to the touch down to the bone. It hurt greatly while walking. He was prescribed Chaihu and Shuzhizi each 1.5 qian, Lonicera and Cinnamon each 1 qian, Astragalus and Angelica each 2 qian, Huangbo and Licorice each 0.5 qian, and Shengma 0.7 qian, decocted with wine, and taken before a light breakfast to alleviate the pain; after a while, the pain ceased immediately. Two days later, the swelling softened and subsided.</p>
<p>Jia Demeo, a ten-year-old boy, suffered greatly from the intense heat of April. An abscess developed on the left thigh near the knee, affecting the channel of the Liver at the Inner side and slightly encroaching on the Spleen channel. The affected area exhibited indistinct flesh color, was swollen and had hard, dry skin, with severe symptoms. His pulse was thin and wiry in the three positions, felt somewhat full and slightly strong. He was treated with 2 qian of Astragalus, 1 qian each of Chaihu and Shengdi, 1.2 qian of Lonicera, and 0.3 qian each of Cinnamon and Tormentil root, and 0.2 qian of Huangbo, 0.75 qian of Angelica, decocted in wine and water, taken on an empty stomach. One dose cured him.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Zhu Zhenheng&#39;s &quot;Heart Method&quot; states: Zhu Shao, suffering from a swollen right leg with a bone abscess, took herbal medicine and liquor, leading to phlegm in the diaphragm and heat stagnation with weakness. I used ten grams each of ginseng, berberine, and Poria, along with forty-nine grams of purchased gourd seeds, divided into two doses, mixed with hot bamboo juice, and he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Health Treasure Mirror&quot; states: In the year of Renwu during the Zhiyuan period, there was a man named Wang Bolu, fifty-seven years old, with swelling in his right arm extending from his elbow to his shoulder and down to his fingers. His skin changed color and felt cool, with a pulse that was deep, thin, and faint, indicating cold. The ulcer doctor Sun Yanhe examined him and said: This is a bone abscess; the opening has been delayed. I used a cautery needle to create an opening, and the pus was clear and thin. The next day, I reopened it, and he continued to suffer from reverse conditions. Yanhe used two doses of clove and persimmon stem decoction; after some time, he still felt worse, experiencing cold pain in the navel and abdomen, fullness, reduced appetite, and occasional confusion. I moxibusted the area under the left breast where the blackness was complete for two periods. Additionally, I prescribed several herbs including dried ginger, aconite, wood incense, deep incense, fennel, and Qianghuo, a total of about sixty grams, to be taken orally.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>It is sometimes said: all pains, itching, and sores are attributed to heart fire, especially during the height of summer; can one use dried ginger and aconite then? I replied: It is evident and must be so. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when the pulse is thin, the skin is cold, there are diarrhea and loss of appetite, this is called the five vacuities. If one eats what is contrary, the stomach is extremely vacuous. All swellings, sores, and ulcers are indeed related to heart fire; this is a determined principle. This condition is a contradiction between internal and external factors, so one must abandon the timing and follow the symptoms; if one does not use strong, acrid, and warm medicines urgently, recovery is impossible. So it was applied, and all symptoms disappeared; appetite returned, the sores had warmth, and the pus was normal. Yan He then administered Wuxiang Decoction several times, and within a month, there was recovery. Ah! To adhere to regularity is the view of the masses; to understand change is the task of great individuals. Many fail because they understand regularity but not change, focusing on minor details; how much more so in medicine? To adhere to regularity and also comprehend change, how can these be spoken of on the same day?<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; says: Da Yin Du Chengqing suffered from a bone abscess, with internal pain like a needle, the external color unchanged, and the condition could not be dispelled. He was pleased that he had not used cold remedies; however, the pain had injured his stomach qi, causing him to lose his appetite. He was treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, but his food intake was still low. He took over twenty doses of the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, and when the pus collected, he used needles to remove it. He continued with a strengthened tonifying decoction, increasing the dosage of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, adding wheat, five flavors, distant will (cornflower), and fritillary bulbs in several doses, gradually stopping the pus and healing the sore. This pattern suggests that the two conditions arose from damp-heat stagnating in the flesh, preventing vital qi from transforming. Thus, the treatment should strengthen the spleen&#39;s earth, harmonize qi and blood, and with moxibustion applied at the garlic position, the abscess would resolve itself.</p>
<p>Li Hubu Mengqing had a bone abscess at the Huan Tiao point. He considered it a small sore and took a detoxifying remedy, further applying cold and cooling medicines to it. As a result, the pain intensified and caused intense eruptions of pus, leading him to realize it was an abscess. He requested treatment; upon examining his pulse, the right guan position was floating and large, indicating that his stomach qi was already injured, thus the sore opened up, the flesh was purple and sunken, and it felt cool to the touch. He mentioned that inside the sore felt slightly cold, fearing it might become a leakage. Therefore, he used cured fermented soybeans for moxibustion on it, and administered the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added patchouli, cardamom, and roasted ginger in several doses. His stomach qi gradually revived, his appetite increased, the affected area warmed up, and muscle tissue gradually began to grow; he was then treated with the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction and fully recovered.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Wang Shiheng experienced swelling and pain in the lower back after childbirth, particularly severe in the legs. This was due to stagnant blood obstructing the meridians. If not treated promptly, it would surely result in bone sores. He was given two doses of Peach Kernel Decoction, which brought slight improvement; additionally, he took several doses of Myrrh Pill and recovered completely. There were also residual bad blood, with stabbing pain in the navel and abdomen, either radiating to the limbs or concentrating in the thighs, causing pain like a needle. This was due to an imbalance of hot and cold or excessive thinking and movement, leading to obstructed qi and stagnant blood in the meridians. The Myrrh Pill should be used for treatment. If the menstrual blood was not flowing, causing radiating pain in the limbs or a stabbing ache in the thighs, potentially due to dampness affecting it and swelling and pain resulting from obstructed menstrual flow, the Angelica Pill should be administered. Stagnation of bad blood is a serious condition, and if treatment is delayed, it may lead to bone sores, often resulting in death.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a bone abscess for a long time without healing, resulting in thin, short, and soft legs, with a weak and slow pulse. She was treated with the Ten Complete Tonic Decoction, adding Achyranthes, Eucommia, and aconite cake for moxibustion. After more than two months, she recovered. Generally, after pus has drained, a weak and slow pulse indicates an easier recovery due to the presence of stomach qi. A thin and deep pulse suggests a deficiency inside wanting to transform. If accompanied by irritability and pain, healing has not yet occurred. A rapidly fluctuating and coarse pulse is difficult to treat because it indicates a deficiency of righteous qi and an abundance of pathogenic qi.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>A man had a condition in his waist, which appeared but did not ulcerate. The essence and blood were only able to manifest but could not develop into pus. After administering several large doses of tonifying medicine, it began to ulcerate, and several more doses yielded pure pus. He then took a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes, amounting to over a pound, and the pus became less thick; after a few pounds, the pus gradually grew thicker, and muscle began to form. Generally, sores and abscesses rely on the essence and blood; if a condition arises without manifesting, or ulcers arise without necrosis, or do not close up, and if the pus is scant or clear, it is a sign of deficiency in essence and blood, and should be treated with strong tonics. Aggressive remedies are the most to be avoided. There are also cases where pus increases excessively, indicating that the essence and blood are too weak to contain it. If, after ulceration, there is fever and thirst, with a strong pulse and increasing pus, this is due to a deficiency of true qi and an excess of pathogenic qi, which are both untreatable. It is commonly seen that individuals with sufficient essence and blood develop sores that are swollen, red, easy to necrotize, and produce thick pus, making them easier to close up. In contrast, weak individuals frequently do not manifest, do not necrotize, and find it difficult to close up. If one carelessly administers aggressive concoctions without careful examination, the calamity of deficiency will be inevitable. After affliction, one must cultivate nourishment, especially in cases of scrofula or similar conditions, as this is particularly crucial for reinforcement. Otherwise, if other conditions arise, it will be difficult to manage, so proceed with caution!<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>A woman had a bone abscess at the hip joint, located along the exterior side of the lesser yang channel.

This indicated that the dispersing treatment was excessive, allowing the solitary yang to rise excessively.</p>
<p>Another person, over forty years old, developed a bone abscess in summer. I used fire needles to remove the stagnant blood and treated him with a tonic drug, leading to his recovery. By autumn, he suddenly lost his appetite; phlegm and qi were severely obstructed. Upon effort, sores appeared on his mouth and tongue. He took cold medicine and experienced abdominal pain, suspecting it to be sores. His spleen and stomach pulses were lightly felt, showing no strength. This indicated true qi deficiency and the rise of empty heat. I treated him with the eight-flavor pill. He was skeptical and self-medicated with two herbs (Chen Pi and Si Wu) and nearly perished.

Qi stated: &quot;The sores and abscesses bring agitation; occasional coughing and abdominal pain, extreme thirst or excessive diarrhea, or small urination like dribbling, indicate a serious condition.&quot; After pus was discharged, if the pulse was surging and rapid, it was difficult to treat; if slightly weak and slow, it was easier to manage. I needled him, and four to five bowls of pus came out. Immediately, he took a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. The next day, the pulse slightly stabilized, and he took the eight-treasure soup with additions of schisandra, ophiopogon, cinnamon, and over thirty other medicinal patches. His pulse softened, the pus thickened, and he recovered after three months.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>An old man suffered from a bone abscess in his leg, which was swollen and hard; pressing on it caused great pain, he had a dry mouth and weak pulse, and the swelling did not break open, with little appetite and thought of food. I indicated that when the swelling is hard below the surface, it arises from the tendons and bones; if the flesh color does not change, it arises from the bone marrow. I then prescribed over thirty doses of ginseng and astragalus, but although the pus matured, it did not drain. I concluded that the medicinal power could not reach the area and that it must be treated with needle puncture. He did not heed my advice and only resorted to acupuncture after ten days, resulting in five to six bowls of clear pus draining out. However, due to his age, he was deficient in qi and blood, and the poison had been there for a long time, ultimately leading to his demise. Generally, when sores do not improve within ten days, one should rely on either drainage of pus, removal of necrotic tissue, or fortifying if weak; this is the essence of complete treatment.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a bone abscess, with thin and short legs that felt soft, and the sore was not healing. Using a complete tonifying soup, external moxibustion with aconite cake, and applying a nourishing medicinal paste, he was appropriately cared for and completely healed after a hundred applications.</p>
<p>A young man had pain in his bones. After taking wind-acting medicinal alcohol for a year, I prescribed a formula to expel wind and clear heat, adding fresh rhinoceros horn and floating duckweed for over a hundred treatments. He developed an abscess, which drained out thick pus and he recovered. After five or six years, he experienced pain in the same area again. I stated that the old illness had returned, and there was nothing more to be done. It arose after his recent marriage, where he consumed fragrant and spicy meats. If he could refrain from such foods and maintain a simple diet, he might still thrive. After four to five years of pus and blood draining, the condition extended to his waist and back, leading to emptiness, and he died three years later. This was purely due to the heat of the illness.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>A woman over forty experienced a swelling and pain in her leg due to cold causing an abscess, with a deep and tight pulse, unable to extend her leg. The treatise states: &quot;The spleen transfers cold to the liver; abscess and swelling cause muscle cramps.&quot; This is because the spleen governs flesh, and the liver governs tendons; when the flesh is warm, the tendons relax, and when the flesh is cold, the tendons tighten. Thus, I administered Boswellia pain-relief pills, resulting in slight improvement. Subsequently, I provided more than twenty prescriptions to reinforce the stomach and invigorate qi and blood, leading to resolution.</p>
<p>A young man, exposed to extreme cold and labor, suffered pain in the sacrum; after two months, he developed an abscess penetrating to the edge of the bone, bedridden for two years. I took and stabilized the remaining bone; this is the result of cold clashing with heat. I removed decayed bone from the long-standing abscess and hemorrhoids, used black chicken leg bones to mix with arsenic, secured with salt and clay, roasted until red, then extracted the toxic fire from the ground, removed the clay, ground the bones finely, made pills the size of millet, and inserted them into the orifice, applying ointment externally.</p>
<p>A woman, due to anger, experienced swelling and pain under her ribs, with pressure in her chest and a deep, slow pulse. Using a formula to alleviate qi flow, she experienced slight recovery with several doses. To this, I added a modified Xiaochaihu Decoction with additional tangerine peel, Platycodon root, and Fritillaria for several doses, leading to significant improvement. Finally, I prescribed more than twenty doses of Xiaochaihu Decoction in conjunction with Siwu Decoction, resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>A man suffered from a leg ulcer that would not heal. He took a nourishing decoction of ginseng and consumed aconite cakes, further applying strengthening ointments in the form of poultices. After more than two months, he recovered. </p>
<p>Another man had swelling in his leg without discoloration or pain; his pulse was floating and slippery. He took a decoction to tonify the center and augment qi, with additional herbs such as pinellia, poria, bitter orange peel, and costus. He applied a compress of cyperus. He claimed there was no way to tonify qi and instead took formulas for flowing qi, which led to his deficiency worsening. He sought further treatment and took a decoction of Six Gentlemen with added angelica and a few doses. He had a poor appetite and later took tonics, recovering after more than a month. The notion that qi cannot be tonified is a common misconception. It is believed that the blockage of qi is difficult to remedy, yet they do not understand that when the vital qi is weak and cannot circulate, then the pathogenic qi stagnates and causes illness. The classics say: when the robust qi circulates, healing follows; when it stagnates, sickness arises. If one does not use supplementation, how can qi circulate?</p>
<p>A man had swelling in his arm with muscle cramps and bone pain for over a year, ultimately leading to ulceration that would not heal. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be weaker. After a small improvement with a remedy for internal congestion, he was treated with a revitalizing decoction and aconite cakes, used with moxibustion, and was subsequently healed. The essentials say: longstanding stagnation, extreme yin produces yang, cold transforms into heat, leading to more ulcers turning into fistulas; therefore, early administration of remedies for internal congestion is advisable.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a long-standing leg issue that would not heal. He took potent tonics and had aconite cakes moxibusted, further using a needle-pointed remedy, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>A man suffered from a hard arm ailment for over a year, experiencing poor appetite and thoughts, with morning chills and evening fevers. He was given Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu, Di Gu Pi, and Mu Dan Pi, and after a month, his chills and fevers had lessened. He then took the Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang and applied aconite cakes for moxibustion. After more than two months, pus formed to a point. He continued taking Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang for half a year and was cured.</p>
<p>A woman whose pus had become thin and clear, with weak pulse and aversion to cold, had long remained unhealed. She took Nei Sai San and received moxibustion with aconite cakes, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman had not been able to close up for a long time and suddenly developed chills and fevers. I diagnosed that both her qi and blood were deficient, but she instead took exterior dispersing herbs, which led to a severe fever and death. Generally, conditions of flowing and condensing are often caused by repressed emotions or sudden anger, or by a deficiency of spleen qi, with dampness reversing in the flesh, or by loose pores allowing cold evils to invade the meridians, or from falls, or postpartum blood stasis flowing to the joints, or leftover evils from febrile diseases causing harm. All these arise from insufficient true qi, which allows evil to take hold. </p>
<p>The usual treatment involves opening those who are repressed, calming those who are angry, dispersing for falls and postpartum blood stasis, eliminating and reinforcing for spleen deficiency and loose pores, and adjusting and resolving for leftover febrile evils. The main focus should be on solidifying the primordial qi, supplemented by herbs that match the symptoms. For long-standing wounds with cold at the openings, further use of fermented soy cake or aconite cakes for moxibustion is recommended. In cases with pus pathways or necrotic flesh, using a needle to disperse the decay for self-healing is very effective, particularly with an ointment. Without nourishing blood and qi, and if dietary and lifestyle habits are not carefully managed, recovery will be impossible.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>A man with weak vital energy was about to suffer from this; his chest and diaphragm were unwell, and he had little appetite or thought for food. I wanted to treat him by strengthening the spleen and stomach, relieving stagnation, and nourishing blood and energy. He did not comply and instead took pungent and warming remedies, leading to swelling. He then took substances like Sanleng, Poria, and Houpu, which caused his appetite to decrease further, and his limbs began to swell slightly, accompanied by a swelling in the waist that did not ulcerate and resulted in his death. This condition was fundamentally one of deficiency and stagnation; now, using counteracting and harsh medicines, how could he not die? Moreover, pungent, warming remedies can only temporarily relieve stagnation and facilitate energy flow; if not properly regulated or overused, they will only increase stagnation and fire, boiling off the vital fluids to create phlegm, which, over time, will not disperse and will lead to more severe conditions.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>A man had three pieces of rotten bone in his arm, and the condition did not subside. He felt hot and thirsty, with a floating and large pulse that was weak, indicating a deficiency of both qi and blood. He needed to take tonic formulas to replenish qi and blood to preserve his health. Confused by excess heat, he continued to use cooling medicines, both internally and externally, which nearly put him in danger before he sought treatment. His condition was notably poor, and his pulse was increasingly weak. Initially, he was given the Six-Gentlemen Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Gui, which gradually improved his appetite over a month. Then he was treated with the Eight-Treasure Decoction with an addition of over thirty doses of cinnamon, and the sores became red. Finally, he received the Complete Nourishing Decoction along with external moxibustion using Fuzi paste, and after a year, he recovered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Li Tingyi from Tongfu suffered from a chronic condition involving phlegm and shortness of breath. He arrogantly relied on his own medical knowledge and used remedies to transform phlegm and regulate qi, but after six months, it turned into an ulcer. He then used other remedies, which led to profuse purulent discharge, persistent swelling and hardness, alternating chills and fever, reduced appetite, muscle wasting, and loose stool. His hands and feet were often cold, and his pulse was floating and large, yet faint on palpation. I said: This indicates a deficiency of the vital fire at the命门, and he should use the Eight-Flavored Pill. Distrustful, he instead took ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, which only worsened his phlegm, coughing, and diarrhea. After taking the Eight-Flavored Pill and the Qi-Enhancing Decoction for over a year, he finally healed.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a flow disorder, with internal swelling and pain. She took a remedy to transform phlegm and resolve qi stagnation, but experienced spontaneous sweating and night sweats, with a pulse that was large and weak; this indicated a deficiency of vital energy. I prescribed one liang each of ginseng and astragalus, five qian each of angelica and atractylodes, and two qian of cinnamon, to be taken as an infusion. By midnight, she began to expel about two bowls of thin pus. The next day, she experienced great sweating, severe fatigue, thirst with a feeling of heat, and her pulse was big and rapid. I continued to use the previous formula, adding one qian of aconite and two qian of roasted licorice. After two doses, her pulse and symptoms had markedly improved. I then prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding ginger and cinnamon for over twenty doses before she could finally leave her bed. Later, due to overexertion, she experienced chills and fever with thirst and sweating. This was mid-winter, so I used the Ten Fully Restorative Decoction with added cinnamon and aconite, and she recovered completely.</p>
<p>Another woman had long suffered from a flow disorder, with weakened spleen and stomach. Suddenly, she developed phlegm accumulation and wheezing, with her head shaking and eyes darting, hands raised and feet flailing, making it hard to take her pulse. Upon examining her face, I noticed a yellow complexion with a greenish hue; this indicated that liver wood was overpowering spleen earth. I treated her with the Six Gentlemen Decoction adding bupleurum and siler and she recovered. I then supplemented with the Qi-boosting Decoction, adding pinellia and poria for stabilization.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>A weak person suffered from internal flux, with five to six bowls of pus discharged. At that time, the mouth and eyes were crooked. I used a decoction of Radix Ginseng with two qian of Aconite; after two doses, there was some improvement. Later, I applied a complete formula for nourishing the body, and after a month, the patient recovered. Generally, when pus and blood from sores have been released, the first priority is to greatly replenish qi and blood. Even if there are other symptoms, they should be treated secondarily.</p>
<p>A scholar suffered from flux, with fever, thirst, headache, spontaneous sweating, and a strong pulse without power upon palpation; this was a condition of cold and deficiency of qi and blood. I used a complete formula for nourishing the body, adding Wheat and Five Flavors, but his symptoms worsened. I continued with the previous medicine, adding one qian of Aconite, and after four doses, all symptoms receded. I then removed the Aconite and added Cinnamon for over twenty doses, gradually restoring qi and blood. </p>
<p>However, he became overworked, experiencing fever and aversion to cold, along with decreased appetite. This indicated damage to the spleen and stomach, with the original qi sinking. I employed a formula for invigorating the middle and boosting qi, adding one qian of Aconite; after two doses, heat subsided and appetite improved, so I continued to nourish the original qi to consolidate it. Later, due to unsuccessful exams and stress, coupled with labor, his appetite diminished daily, leading to further decline of vitality. He had phlegmatic vomiting, thirst, headaches, aversion to cold, with intermittent fevers. I continued to apply the invigorating formula for several doses, and his symptoms gradually improved, with vitality slowly returning. Finally, I removed the Aconite and added half a qian of Cinnamon, administering over a hundred doses until he recovered.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The &quot;Wai Ke Zheng Zong&quot; states: A man suffers from lingering effects of cold, with swelling and pain in the thigh, and a pulse that is floating, rapid, and weak. This is due to the cold not being completely expelled, leading to internal deficiency. Administer five accumulations powder with ephedra and add cattle knee for two doses, and the pain slightly alleviates; then use a decoction of astragalus wine for four doses, which resolves both pain and swelling. However, there remains a lump on the outer side of the leg that does not subside, indicating stagnation of stasis blood that may turn into pus. Therefore, use herbs that expel inside, wait for the pus to mature before applying a needle, and further use a complete tonic blend for astringency.</p>
<p>A man who works hard experiences leg pain during cold spells, accompanied by chills and fever, vomiting, and chest fullness with loss of appetite. This is due to emotional distress and irregular diet, injuring the spleen and stomach, leading to deficiency of spleen qi, which cannot properly transform food. Phlegm accumulates in the middle, and damp heat moves downward, manifesting as foot gout. To address this, administer breakthrough guide pills for two doses to dispel phlegm; then use a decoction of pinellia for several doses to stop vomiting and facilitate digestion; finally, provide a decoction of aconite with six herbs for several doses to prevent further episodes.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>An old man, aged sixty, suffered from kidney deficiency, resulting in muscle cramps and atrophy, with weak knees and feet, making it difficult for him to walk. He applied an external plaster to dispel wind and remove dampness and took San Yin Sheng Jun Wan orally, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man experienced swelling and pain in his right leg for over two months, feeling lethargic and critically ill. I noted that pus had formed for a long time and suggested forcibly opening it to allow drainage. He used a pus-drainage basin and took two doses of Shen Shen Decoction, which revived him; afterwards, he took Shiquan Dabu Decoction for a hundred days to stabilize his condition.</p>
<p>Another man, after sexual activity, felt coldness in his lower region, with a vague pain in his thigh that worsened at night, making it hard for him to walk. The physician treated him with medications to dispel cold, remove dampness, and alleviate pain, but the pain worsened. Upon diagnosis, his pulse was thin and weak, indicating a lack of qi and blood, along with invasion by cold. I prescribed two doses of Da Fang Feng Decoction, which significantly reduced the pain; after four more doses, he was completely well.</p>
<p>In the summer, a man was caught sleeping in the wind, leading to cold invasion in his left leg, resulting in swelling and pain, accompanied by alternating chills and fever, and a feeling of fullness in his chest, causing loss of appetite. He took Bao An Wan Ling Dan and scallion soup to help; bathing and inducing sweat helped disperse the cold poison from his marrow. Afterwards, he took Da Fang Feng Decoction, removing Qiang Huo and adding safflower and broken antique paper to warm the kidney channel and smooth the meridians. Gradually, his swelling and pain subsided, and his blood circulation improved; he then took San Yin Sheng Jun Wan intermittently, eventually recovering after two months of care.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>A candidate who wished to avoid the cold developed leg pain. I treated him with warming kidney qi and medicines to dispel cold from the meridians. He thought he was improving and requested an internal physician, who prescribed exterior-releasing herbs. Although the exterior pathogens were dispelled, his interior was surely deficient. I then used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and similar medicines for tonification, resulting in the occurrence of deficiency heat, causing dry mouth, sore throat, and incessant thirst. Further treatment with Zhi Mu and Shi Gao Decoction was employed to clear the upper, and Wind Protection, Mugwort, and Weilingxian were used to attack the lower. Opinions varied widely, and various mixed herbs were improperly administered, which resulted in the condition worsening. He requested treatment again. At that time, his leg was more swollen, and its shape had shrunk—a sign of impending death. Moreover, this condition originally stemmed from the kidneys being affected by cold; without the use of Aconite or broken lance leaf, one cannot open the joints, and without Qiang Huo, Fang Feng, and Niu Xi, one cannot facilitate circulation and remove blockage. Without Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, and Zhi Gan Cao, one cannot ensure the spleen qi reaches the limbs, and without Chuan Xiong, Dong Gui, Bai Shao, Shu Di, and Hong Hua, one cannot nourish and invigorate the blood. When a disease arises from deficiency, one must first replenish the deficiency before attacking the illness. Furthermore, for this condition, to apply dispersing and muscle-releasing methods without any warming and tonifying would surely lead to death. In the end, he died.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Works of Jing Yue&quot; states: There was a man from Wei, over thirty years old, who had long been hard-working. Suddenly, he suffered from pain and soreness in his thighs. After a few months, his thighs began to swell. When I examined him, I said, &quot;This is a case of suppurative osteomyelitis; it must be treated promptly.&quot; I administered two doses of a life-saving decoction, but before it could take effect, the swelling worsened due to panicked treatment with various remedies to clear heat and resolve toxicity, leading to vomiting and fever, with an inability to eat, putting his condition in grave danger. Then, in desperate request for rescue, I used a mixture of ginseng and astragalus with a large amount of roasted ginger. After several doses, his vomiting ceased and he was able to eat. The swelling softened and matured, indicating that pus had formed. I then used a needle, which extracted only a small amount of pus. I subsequently administered a decoction of Nine Herbs, leading to a large discharge of pus. Many lumps of pus emerged, with five or six ulcers, and the flesh on his leg was entirely gone, leaving only skin and bone. After the ulcers opened, he experienced vomiting and continued fever with no appetite, so I alternated doses of the &quot;Ten Complete Great Supplements Decoction&quot; and the Nine Herbs decoction. Gradually, his fever subsided, and his appetite returned, showing some improvement in color. However, the tendons in his leg had contracted, allowing him only to raise his knee while lying on his back, unable to move. Any movement caused extreme pain, and he felt like he had become useless. After this, I administered over eighty doses of the &quot;Ten Complete Great Supplements Decoction,&quot; using three pounds of ginseng in total, and his leg flesh gradually regrew, the tendons relaxed as before, transforming him into a robust young man. This was all thanks to the efficacy of the rescue treatment.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>A man surnamed Chen, nearing thirty, had always indulged his desires and suddenly felt pain in his hip, which did not heal for over a month. I said, &quot;This is most concerning; it may lead to the issue of boils and toxins.&quot; He did not believe me and sought advice from a mediocre doctor, who mocked my words and said, &quot;Such nonsense is truly laughable. Muscular and skeletal pain is common and merely caused by wind and heat; why speak of boils and toxins?&quot; He then used medicine to dispel wind and clear heat. Half a year later, he indeed showed slight swelling and returned for treatment. I advised, &quot;Quickly use tonics to support the root; it is not too late yet.&quot; He again did not believe and consulted a sore specialist, who said, &quot;How can one warm and tonify when the swollen sore has not yet burst?&quot; He once more used remedies to clear heat and dispel toxins, and when it eventually erupted dangerously, I examined him and found both pulse and signs failed. Only then did he believe my words, regretting his previous mistakes, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>A young man surnamed Mao, not yet thirty, who indulged in wine and pleasures, suffered from a similar condition. I urged him to take medicine early, but he stubbornly refused. When his swelling turned into pus, I advised him to have it punctured quickly; yet, he feared the pain and did not comply. Unaware that pus had already formed, he listened to inferior voices recommending bitter cold detoxifying medicines, which were decidedly ineffective, leading only to deeper issues, until he awaited a spontaneous rupture and lost all vitality, making recovery impossible.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>In the case of bone abscess, it is named so because it does not break, but rather the pus forms in the bone. It commonly appears in the joints of the limbs; in men and postpartum women, it tends to develop in the abdomen; in children, it often occurs on the back. For adults, if it develops quickly, they first feel pain and cannot move. Pressing on the bone will cause increased pain, and over time, the skin and flesh become increasingly tense and swollen, resembling a fatty condition. For a child, if they approach it with their hand, they will start to cry loudly, indicating pain in their joints. Adults with a slower onset will first feel a warmth in their muscles, and after a day, they will have a sense of pain and numbness. Children may be unable to move their limbs, also appearing as if they cannot be moved. Observing the joints, if there are warm spots in the muscles, and one does not recognize it as a bone abscess, it may lead to generalized swelling without breaking, and there can be a bluish darkening throughout the body. Adults may also misidentify it, calling it &quot;wind swelling,&quot; unaware that it is an abscess. Whenever a person suffers from heat in the body, seeking coolness from the wind can cause the wind to enter the joints; when wind and heat clash, it results in a bone abscess. The symptoms include drowsiness and a heavy feeling, along with intermittent ringing in the ears. Furthermore, sleeping exposed to dew in autumn or summer can lead to being affected by the cold, causing the wind and heat to congeal, resulting in this illness. In acute cases, heat is prevalent and wind is less, while in chronic cases, there is more wind and less heat. Not knowing how wind and cold contribute to this illness arises from the abundance of blood and softness of muscles, leading to the wind affecting them and causing congestion.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Whenever one first develops a bone ulcer, it is essential to urgently take Luolu soup and consume it. Applying a mixture of mung bean powder can help eliminate the ulcer, and one can also take a decoction of Wuxiang and Lianqiao. </p>
<p>For chronic ulcers that have deteriorated into deep ones, which often arise in the tibia and lead to sores, causing cold and stagnant conditions that prevent healing for years, they may develop into bone ulcers, also known as &quot;sore bones.&quot; These ulcers present as deep, rotten, and bluish-black, with firm and strong edges, and yellowish pus and blood exuding from the center, remaining unhealed despite numerous medicines. The discharge may worsen, the surrounding healthy tissue may become swollen and fragile, and fragments of bone may emerge. </p>
<p>In such cases, warm Red Dragon Skin soup is recommended, washing daily in summer and every four days in winter. For abundant unhealthy flesh, one can apply a mixture made with white (wild) lily powder to devitalize the bad tissue, repeating this application over three days. Afterwards, continue with a mixture of pig dung powder until healing is achieved. The ash from burnt pig dung should be ground into a fine powder and packed into the sore until thoroughly filled; when the white juice oozes out, it should be carefully cleaned, and the application changed as necessary until healing is complete. </p>
<p>If unhealthy flesh persists, reapply the white (wild) lily powder as before, accompanied by the pig dung mixture to balance the condition. For stubborn bone ulcers that do not heal despite a hundred treatments, one should apply moxibustion to the ulcer in a sequential manner; doing this for three days and nights can lead to healing. If the sore does not heal or recurs with bone protruding from an opening, it is called a bone ulcer. </p>
<p>In such cases, take a dead female crow, remove the flesh to keep the bones, and char them until they resemble charcoal. Obtain wood shavings from three cows’ horns, about one tael each, and burn them to ash, and then combine them to treat the ulcerated bone, as this will help in healing it.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment of Flowing and Draining Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Blood sores associated with flowing and draining symptoms frequently occur in those who are heavyset and fond of eating fried, roasted, and sweetened foods. When the sore is large, it may resemble a chicken egg and appear like a purple plum, swollen but not red. It intertwines with the meridians and flows into the bones and joints, causing overall soreness and pain in every joint. For treatment, use an internal powder combined with papaya, white peony, and forsythia, and also take frankincense heart-nourishing powder and alum pills, along with applying a medicinal wrap externally. One should follow the indications cautiously and not rigidly adhere to formulas.</p>
<p>For small intestine flowing and draining symptoms that stem from heat in the heart channel and result in toxic accumulation, one should use &quot;Defeating Toxin Flowing Qi Decoction&quot; and follow up with &quot;Clearing Heart Flowing Qi Decoction&quot; for treatment.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Cold leakage and damp poisons can flow and gather; this poison may arise from scratching an itchy foot, leading to injuries from fire and wind. Alternatively, it may stem from cold dampness accumulating in the feet and lower legs, resulting in ulcers resembling cow&#39;s eyes, with surrounding purple and black discoloration, often exuding foul blood and water. First, use a three-edged needle to pierce around the wound to drain the blood completely, then apply golden thread ointment to draw out the toxic fluid and rotten flesh. Afterward, apply purple gold ointment, monitoring the ulcer until it reddens and becomes active again, then cover it with a protective paper ointment.</p>
<p>For symptoms of toxic flow, which occur due to irregular emotions, poor eating habits, food stagnation, or straining oneself with heavy loads, damaging the meridians, one should take herbs to dispel toxins and promote the flow of qi, such as the Decoction to Disperse Toxins or the Inner Treasure Thousand Gold Powder, alum pills, and Heart-Protecting Pills. This condition arises from an external invasion of wind, dampness, and heat, initially manifesting as one or two sores, gradually increasing to more, and potentially spreading all over the body. First, induce sweating to relieve wind and dampness, and then use ginseng and astragalus formulas for nourishment. Mix ginger juice and vinegar with the surrounding medicine. Next, take the Inner Treasure Thousand Gold Powder with increased amounts of ginseng and astragalus; during rainy weather, add aster root and alisma.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment for Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The bone abscess, also known as an abscess adhering to the bone, arises from attachment to the bone and meat, and while the terms differ, the affliction is the same. This condition emerges due to intense heat from summer, allowing pernicious wind to enter the joints, which clashes with the heat and is then countered by cold and dampness. It may also occur from excessive labor, standing in water, or sitting or lying on damp ground, combined with a weak body that succumbs to cold pathogens, resulting in wind and heat blocking and restraining, leading to the formation of abscesses at the large joints.</p>
<p>In acute cases, movement is impossible, and pressing on the area causes sharp pain deep within the bone. Over the course of days, there is a sensation of urgency in the flesh, swelling significantly. In mild cases, there may be slight soreness which gradually increases, making it difficult to walk, causing disconnection between bone and flesh. If untreated, the body may develop pus without draining, leading to a darkening of the skin and severe pain upon pressure, and over time this can lead to swelling and a transformed state resembling tuberculosis.</p>
<p>If the bone abscess persists, it may swell and develop pus, hence the distinction. When treating a bone abscess, if the malady is rooted in wind, the condition will be severe, with deep and abundant pus. Any signs of withering or cramping signify the gradual onset of a bone abscess. Symptoms include fatigue in the limbs, alternating chills and fever, reddish urine, difficult bowel movements, and absence of sweating.</p>
<p>To treat this, one should use perilla, wormwood, and balsamodendron decoction for hot compresses to open the pores, dry the area, and then cover with a dry blanket, followed by incense burning to aid in recovery. If there is severe weakness, ginseng paste should be taken, with a small addition of aconite to bolster energy, combined with moxa therapy, ensuring recovery without fail.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone abscess occurs when toxic gas deeply adheres to the bone. This illness resembles the effects of stolen wind, yet it is different; one cannot distinguish between them, leading to errors in treatment. Bone abscess typically develops when one exposes themselves to cold while resting in summer or autumn, where wind and heat become trapped, causing an abscess to form on the bone. The symptoms of stolen wind arise from the wind pathogen impacting the joints, causing deep pain in the marrow; this pain worsens in the cold. Bone abscess is characterized by pain that prevents movement. Initially, upon pressing the area, one may feel slight discomfort in the skin and flesh, resembling a swelling that is thick and full. The bone affected by stolen wind does not feel very hot, but is accompanied by a chilling sensation, and sweating may occasionally occur, leading to a constant desire to heat the painful area for relief. In the early stage of bone abscess, pain is intermittent and may fluctuate between cold and hot sensations without sweating. If it persists without resolution, the cold transforms into heat, ultimately leading to suppuration.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the invading wind is not treated, it can become twisted and withered over time, hence the differences.

For all these cases, it is advisable to apply moxibustion to the affected area to disperse toxic qi, replenish and revive the yang qi, and primarily warm and support the spleen and stomach.

If one feels fatigued with reduced appetite, simply using the aforementioned decoctions will nurture the internal organs, preventing evil from overpowering the righteous. If pus has already formed, it should be needled to prevent the poison from invading internally; even using a live needle is acceptable. Using a fire needle does not cause pain and facilitates easier closure. Garlic moxibustion can detoxify and promote the movement of qi, while scallion poultices assist the yang qi and relieve stagnation.

<p>The symptoms of flow and confluence often arise from emotional stagnation, whether from excessive anger, spleen qi deficiency, or dampness rebelling against the flesh; or the pores being insufficiently closed, allowing cold evil to invade the meridians; or due to phlegm dampness, or sudden injuries, or postpartum blood stasis affecting the joints; or from residual cold evil not yet resolved.

<p>If there is a prolonged lack of healing, additionally use fermented soybeans and amber ointment to dispel cold evil and replenish yang energy. If there are internal pus tubes that do not heal, use a needle to disperse and dissolve them. The classics state: when the form is injured, swelling occurs; when the qi is injured, pain arises. It is also stated: if true qi is lost, there is deficiency; if evil qi is excessive, there is fullness. If one does not replenish qi and blood, regulate diet, take care in daily life, avoid the seven emotions, and exclusively use cold and cool remedies, then those who do not perish are merely fortunate. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Appendicular Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The appendicular bone abscess is a sign of the failure of flowing energy. If cool herbs are used, they will internally damage the spleen and externally cool the blood. The spleen governs the muscles; if the spleen qi is harmed, appetite will decrease, and muscles will not grow. Blood is the network of vessels; if the blood is cooled, then the qi and blood will not be abundant and will stagnate. It is advisable to regulate the spleen; when the spleen is healthy, the blood will naturally generate, and the qi will run smoothly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the phenomenon of the white tiger flying corpse, lingering for cycles, sometimes lasting several years, where cold toxins decay the bones, eventually resulting in self-healing. If the bone becomes corrupted, it may recover, but if the bone truly rots, it leads to lifelong disability. Toxic swellings may arise from the hands and feet or head and face, accompanied by pain, extending to the neck and joints, like scrofula with pearls—this is a sign of wind and dampness blocking energy, and should be treated with modified Xiao Xu Ming Decoction and Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction.</p>
<p>There may also be swelling and pain in the knees, or pain in various joints throughout the body—this is called wind-damp bi, also known as rheumatic wind, and should be treated with Aconite and Eight Ingredients Decoction. Additionally, tubercles may appear in the neck, armpits, near the breasts, or in the soft flesh around the hips, referred to as &quot;disease lesions&quot; and associated with cold conditions.</p>
<p>In children, stagnation of phlegm may lead to tubercles in the neck, buttocks, chest, and back, which is also a cold condition, and should also be treated with warm herbs applied topically. </p>
<p>All of these symptoms arise from the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones; when the kidneys are deficient, the bones become cold and problematic. The so-called bone abscesses originate from the kidneys, as they have their root here. Therefore, using large Aconite to supplement kidney qi will ensure that when the kidneys are robust, the bones will be vital, and abscesses will not attach to the bones.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Proof of Treatment Guidelines</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Wang Kengtang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Affiliated Bone Carbuncle</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked how to distinguish an affiliated bone carbuncle. It is said: In cases of flowing pain, if the exterior is not fully resolved, residual toxins adhere to the bone and form a carbuncle. For those on the outer thigh, it belongs to the Yangming meridian of the foot, while those on the inner thigh belong to the Jueyin and Shaoyin meridians of the foot. Furthermore, it is stated: Wind and dampness, together with heat, lead to heat accumulation that adheres to the bone, resulting in carbuncles. The bone is associated with the kidneys; if the kidneys are deficient, the bones become cold, causing toxins to adhere to them. When bones are cold, qi becomes increasingly stagnant and accumulates, which can result in swelling but not pus. Flowing pain stems from the residual toxins of a febrile disease, whereas bone carbuncles are a complication of flowing pain. The flowing pain is not a fault of the febrile disease but rather an inadequacy in treatment by the physician. Bone carbuncles are not merely a consequence of flowing pain but rather an error by the inept physician in using cooling medicines. Additionally, it is mentioned: prolonged indulgence in rich foods, followed by drunkenness, exposure to water, or walking on ice or snow can lead to cold entering the hip joint, with phlegm and blood stasis interacting to form a carbuncle. Initially, there may be intermittent pain, fluctuating between cold and heat without sweating. Over time, the pain deepens into the bone and is persistent, with continuous tenderness upon pressure; this is the condition.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the initial stage, one should use garlic moxibustion; using more is better. It is essential to overcome the effects of the golden elixir and black gold powder that induce sweating. For those who are robust, one can take a single golden elixir or Eight-array Powder. If it continues for a long time, extreme yin generates yang, cold transforms into heat, leading to rotting flesh and forming pus. When the pus is formed, it is advisable to apply cauterization, supplemented by the Ten Perfectly Nourishing Decoction with added ligusticum and papaya for nourishment. </p>
<p>If there are long-standing toxic accumulations that linger and twist for over a year, resulting in rotten bones; even if the bones emerge, they do not heal and may lead to lifelong consequences. Observe whether the pus is white and thin: this indicates initial bone fragmentation and deep flesh is hard to extract; if the pus is white and thick: this indicates that the bone is about to emerge, and shallow flesh is easier to take. Overall, when long-term decay leads to bone exposure, regardless of strength, age, or weakness, one must provide nourishment to ensure that qi and blood flow harmoniously, restoring proper energy gradually, while dispelling evil energies naturally. The Ten Perfectly Nourishing Decoction and Ginseng Nourishing Decoction should certainly be used.</p>
<p>If pus has not formed, apply a harmonizing ointment because Duhuo can indeed invigorate the movement of qi and blood. If there is already an ulcer, it is advisable to take He Shou Wu Powder, as this medicine can harmonize yin and yang.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the discoloration is yellow and does not flow, it is commonly referred to as &quot;horse sickness.&quot; If it flows, it is called &quot;wandering flowing injection,&quot; commonly known as &quot;tendon horse.&quot; The external shape is slightly swollen, with severe internal pain at the joints, known as &quot;sucking bone horse.&quot; If there is pain in all the joints of the body, preventing one from sitting or standing, with no lumps and persistent heat, it is also referred to as &quot;sucking bone horse.&quot; If there are lumps appearing on the spine and hip bones, whether one or two or three to five in number, it is called &quot;over spine horse.&quot; If there are lumps with heat on the tailbone, it is called &quot;overstraining horse.&quot; If there is severe pain below the knee joint without lumps but with swelling, it is known as &quot;locked foot horse.&quot; If there is pain at the joints where bones intersect, with slight swelling but no lumps, it is called &quot;joint bone horse.&quot; This condition is due to wind and heat scattering through the limbs; treatment should focus on dispersing wind and relieving heat. Initially, do not use fire needles to cauterize; if swelling is severe, only puncture with a sharp needle. For chronic cases, cauterization with fire needles is acceptable. A flowing injection into the thigh is fatal. If remnants of cold damage remain, harmonization should be applied using Shen Qi Bai Du San, followed by Xiao Chai Hu Tang combined with Er Chen Tang, adding Qiang Huo, Chuan Xiong, Zhi Ke, Dang Gui, and Bai Zhu.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

If there is no damp-heat, you may boil it with half water and half wine, as wine can promote blood circulation and vital energy. When energy circulates, blood flows, and recovery is assured. However, why should we address the surface issues? This is to trace the cause, explore its origins, and not forget the root of the illness.

Incompetent doctors lack insight, are blind in mind and deaf in spirit, and falsely claim to have clear perception. Even if they recognize bone abscesses, they have no effective methods to treat them, relying instead on cold medicines and harsh toxic treatments, causing toxin stagnation.

When bones form abscesses, they cannot be treated with medicine, hence they are called &quot;bone-attach abscess&quot; and also &quot;tiger-flying corpse.&quot; If it lingers for a while, extending over several years, the cold poison decays the bone, and it may eventually heal by itself. Those that do not heal may persist for a lifetime; this is a failure from the outset. Many instances of bone decay involve accessory bones, which may still heal, but decay of the main bones results in lifelong disabilities. Therefore, when the pus is white and clear, it signifies that the shattered bone has just come loose, and the flesh is deep and difficult to extract; when the pus is yellow and thick, it means the shattered bone is about to come out, and the flesh is shallow and easier to access, thus it is advisable to use a sharp blade for extraction. </p>
<p>There are also cases of fluid accumulation as large as a gourd covering a bowl, seen on the chest or back, whose symptoms are similar to a fever; after using the nourishing and circulating herbal decoction, if there is even a slight change in condition, it is no longer a fever. It is suitable to use internal supplements as complementary treatments, with variations according to symptoms, to help eliminate the interior issues. Generally, fluid accumulation originates from cold, hence the pain is in the bones; the bones are a residue of the kidneys, and when the kidneys are deficient, the bones become cold, causing pain, as what is called &quot;bone abscess&quot; arises from kidney issues, rooted in this fact. Therefore, to nourish the kidneys, one must use great aconite to achieve the desired effect. When the kidneys are robust, the bones are vitalized, and abscesses do not attach to the bones. In all medicinal applications, one should not adhere to a single way, but rather value adaptability and change.</p>
<p>For cold conditions of fluid accumulation, it largely attaches within the bones, becoming hard and unyielding, with cold bones causing pain, and muscles unable to stretch or extend.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

If the symptoms ease slightly, mix equal parts of military ginger, white angelica, cinnamon, and black grass, adjusting with hot wine for application; this will relieve cold in the bones and stop pain, leading to warmth in the qi, allowing the muscles to naturally stretch, and hard flesh to dissipate.

<p>If asked about continuous pus between the knees that has not healed for years, one might say: This is referred to as lower sores, also known as damp toxin sores. This arises from damp heat in the spleen and stomach descending, leading to numbness in the muscles, resulting in sores.

<p><strong>Bone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone abscess, or &quot;Fu Gu Ju,&quot; arises from cold and damp invading the bones. However, if a person’s vital energy and blood are robust and healthy, even in the face of cold, malevolent forces cannot penetrate the bones. Those afflicted are generally individuals with weak constitutions, exposed to cold and damp while sleeping in summer and autumn, or those who have had intimate relationships covered with thin bedding, allowing cold air to enter their bodies through weaknesses, ultimately leading to this illness. Initially, symptoms include alternating chills and fever, resembling wind invasions. Subsequently, pain in the buttocks and legs ensues, without significant heat or redness, but with bone-deep pain; in severe cases, the affected cannot move or turn. Over time, the cold transforms into heat, worsening until flesh rots and turns to pus, indicating the abscess has formed.</p>
<p>For treatment, at the onset of chills and fever with pain, employ &quot;Wu Ji San&quot; with added &quot;Niu Xi&quot; and &quot;Hong Hua&quot; to induce sweating, dispel cold, and promote circulation. Alternatively, &quot;Wan Ling Dan&quot; can also be used for sweating. Follow up with &quot;Da Fang Feng Tang&quot; to invigorate blood flow, dispel dampness, and replenish vitality. In cases where the abscess occurs in the buttocks causing diffuse swelling and pain, &quot;Nei Tuo Qiang Huo Tang&quot; should be applied; for diffuse swelling and pain near the knee and thigh, use &quot;Nei Tuo Qi Chai Tang&quot;; and for the outer side of the leg, employ &quot;Nei Tuo Jiu Jian Tang.&quot; At the early stage, a universally applicable remedy is &quot;Ren Shen Bai Du San&quot; with added &quot;Mu Guo,&quot; &quot;Niu Xi,&quot; &quot;Su Mu,&quot; and &quot;Hong Hua.&quot; For those with deficiency, use &quot;Shi Quan Da Bu Tang&quot; with additions of &quot;Qiang Huo,&quot; &quot;Fang Ji,&quot; and &quot;Niu Xi.&quot; When an abscess is about to form pus, use &quot;Fu Zi Ba Zhen Tang.&quot;<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For an abscess that has formed with swelling and pain, one should apply acupuncture. For thick yellow pus with a solid body, the formula &quot;Shiquan Dabu Tang&quot; (Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction) is appropriate. For clear white pus with a weak body, use &quot;Baoyuan Dacheng Tang&quot; (Great Achievement of Preserving Origin Decoction). For those with little appetite and fatigue, &quot;Xiangsha Liujunzi Tang&quot; (Aromatic Sand Six Gentlemen Decoction) is recommended. For cases of spleen deficiency with alternating cold and heat, &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Tang&quot; (Tonifying the Middle and Augmenting Qi Decoction) is suitable, as these formulas can help regulate the condition.</p>
<p>There are also cases of wind-dampness presenting as initially alternating chills and fevers, followed by leg swelling and pain, characterized by a smooth and slightly red appearance, accompanied by heat and swelling. If pressed, the area feels like mud and is difficult to move; in such instances, &quot;Danggui Nian Tong Tang&quot; (Angelica Pain-Relieving Decoction) or &quot;Fuling Zuojing Tang&quot; (Poria Assisting the Channels Decoction) should be used, intermittently paired with &quot;Wanling Dan&quot; (Universal Cure Pill) to enhance the treatment.</p>
<p>All the above conditions arise from insufficient vital energy and should not be treated with tonics that drain the spleen, expel energy, or weaken toxins, nor should cold and cooling methods be employed externally. Misuse of such treatments will surely lead to stagnant and congealed vital energy and blood, internal flesh becoming necrotic, which over time will turn into foul pus and drain uncontrollably, leading to fatal outcomes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for those whose condition arises from sexual exhaustion, experiencing alternating cold and heat, disharmony of vital energy and blood, and obstruction of the meridians, which deepens the disease, the affliction may cause the thigh to gradually swell as large as a winter melon, extending from above the hips down to the soles of the feet, resulting in diffuse swelling with skin that is not red. Over time, it may ulcerate with pus that is white and fetid, persisting swelling and unrelenting pain, leading to a decline in vital energy and body mass, with dry and scorched lips and tongue, and hard, secretive excretion. If various medicines are ineffective and food intake ceases, it will ultimately become untreatable.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Complete Book of Jingyue</strong> by Zhang Jieben (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Appendicular Bone Abscess Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as appendicular bone abscess is commonly referred to in modern terms as a bone abscess. Any abscess caused by deep toxic energy gathering at the bone interface can be termed as such. However, this condition particularly occurs in the thicker flesh between the thighs. The causes of this condition include injuries to the muscles and bones resulting in damage to the blood vessels, excessive indulgence in alcohol leading to depletion of the body&#39;s Yin, emotional distress and anger causing stagnation of Qi, and invasion by wind, cold, and dampness that obstructs the meridians. If a person experiences prolonged and unexplained soreness at the Hui Tiao point, it is a sign of this condition, and urgent treatment is necessary. </p>
<p>Initially, it arises from a slight blockage in the Shaoyang meridian; if this blockage does not resolve, it gradually leads to obstruction, swelling, and potential rupture. As it spreads, it affects all three Yin and three Yang meridians, leading to overall leg disruption. This condition fundamentally results from a significant depletion of the vital energy, causing stagnation that can lead to rupture, making it a serious condition. </p>
<p>If rupture occurs and the pulse is harmonious, although the patient may feel extremely weak, focusing on replenishing Qi and blood can ensure recovery. However, if after rupture the pulse is forceful and wiry, coupled with restlessness, fever, and thirst, then treatment is not advised. For treatment of this condition resulting from injury to muscles and bones, it is recommended to use a combination of the Da Ying Decoction and the Da Fang Feng Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If alcohol or excessive emotions harm the body’s Yin, one should use Ba Wei Wan, Liu Wei Wan, or You Gui Wan along with Da Fang Feng Decoction. If anxiety, worry, or anger cause qi stagnation, one should use Chuang Ke Liu Qi Drink or Wu Xiang Lian Qiao Decoction combined with Da Fang Feng Decoction. If attacked by wind-cold from outside, one should use Wu Ji San combined with Da Fang Feng Decoction. Generally, if this condition arises, one should promptly use Da Ying Decoction to warm and tonify qi and blood, or combine it with Xian Fang Huo Ming Drink to expel toxins. </p>
<p>In cases of heat, one should quickly use Lian Qiao Gui Wei Decoction to resolve the toxins, and also quickly apply garlic moxibustion or bean paste cakes for direct moxibustion to rapidly disperse the toxins, which is the most effective method. If there are symptoms of damp-heat or phlegm accumulation, further treatment methods should be sought to avoid serious harm. </p>
<p>If there is persistent pain at the环跳 point or slight swelling in the hip and thigh, and it is judged to have formed, one must act quickly to nourish and strengthen the root, facilitating a quick rupture; if the base is solid, even if there are serious issues, the harm will be minimized, and it will be easier for it to burst, gather, and heal. If the pulse is slippery and rapid, pressing indicates it is soft and ripe, indicating pus formation; it is urgent to use acupuncture to prevent it from being retained for too long and causing deeper issues. </p>
<p>If one is unclear about the benefits and harms, pursuing immediate relief might involve methods that harm the root qi, or using cold and cooling medicines to suppress the toxic qi, leading to prolonged suffering and weakening of the root qi; this would result in an inevitable, uncontrollable rupture. Texts have not thoroughly detailed these conditions, so the underlying causes and treatment strategies are compiled.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Prescription</strong></p>
<p>For treating sores with flowing Qi: This remedy addresses fluid retention resulting from internal heat, emotional stagnation, or accumulations that cause hard, painful lumps; it may also alleviate chest fullness or dampness from wind and cold, affecting the meridians; or blood stagnation forming lumps that remain a normal color; or widespread swelling that is heavy without a clear starting point; or symptoms like yin deficiency and lumps akin to breasts, whether they are beginning to fester or have already developed pus with unhealthy tissue.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Platycodon, ginseng, angelica, cinnamon, licorice, astragalus (fried in salt water), magnolia bark (prepared with ginger), perilla, white peony, lindera, saposhnikovia, bitter orange, betel palm, fragrant wood, chuanxiong, and angelica dahurica. </p>
<p>Direction: Boil with fresh ginger for oral consumption. For pain, add frankincense and myrrh; if the sore is dry, add anemarrhena and fritillaria; if not dry, add fried soapberry spikes; for fluid retention, include qinghao and duhuo; for Qi stagnation, add cyperus; for stomach deficiency, use aged tangerine peel. This is a formula for invigorating Qi and dispersing blood. If taken excessively, it may harm Qi and blood, leading to insufficient material for pus formation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The yellow dog&#39;s lower jaw is a remedy for abdominal and lower abdominal carbuncles, as well as bone carbuncles on the legs, with remarkable effects. It is also said to be able to treat back ailments. Generally, this remedy is excellent for treating lower body sores and boils. </p>
<p>Take the yellow dog&#39;s lower jaw and tongue, together with the skin and fur, and chop it finely. Place it in a jar with salt and clay, sealing it tightly with an iron lid. Burn a stick of incense; when the smoke becomes clear, stop. It is important to maintain the right properties, as over-processing will render it ineffective. The ash should be purely black to be considered effective; if it has white, it has been over-processed and should not be used. When preparing, grind it into a very fine powder.</p>
<p>Mix equal parts of the coarse powder, including white mustache powder and fresh pea powder; each should be five qian (a traditional weight unit). Take it on an empty stomach with wine. Externally, use equal parts of the three ingredients as a poultice, mixed with fragrant oil and applied to the affected area. The effectiveness can be judged by the appearance of foul-smelling sweat and deep sleep after taking the medicine. </p>
<p>The historian He Ting observed the effects firsthand when visiting Gu Tianyu&#39;s residence. Many in the world have used this remedy, and it has been recorded in the Wan family&#39;s manuscript. However, they only recognize its use as a poultice to reduce swelling and alleviate pain, without realizing that it is a miraculous drug for internal consumption to eliminate lower body sores and boils. I once had a litter carrier who experienced severe pain in his lower back, as if being pecked by a chicken or burned by fire. I happened to have this medicine and mixed three qian with wine for him to drink. He did not improve after the first dose, but after taking a second dose, he suddenly felt relief. The next day, he carried the litter as usual, without any pain left.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>For pain at the Huantiao point, to prevent the formation of abscesses: use a combination of Cangzhu and Huangbo for their pungency, activated by Qingpi; in winter, add Guizhi, and in summer, add a piece of Jiaozi Huangqin; for those with a weak constitution, add Tu Niuxi, using Sheng Gancao as the guiding herb. Decoct with major spices, and incorporate fresh ginger juice with a spicy note, to be consumed before meals. If the illness is severe, it might be necessary to add a couple of doses of Mahuang if Cangzhu, Huangbo, and Guizhi fail to take effect. If there is still no response, it may indicate that an abscess is about to form. Urgently create a pit in the ground, heat it with fire until red, pour in urine, and sit over it while wrapped in a mat to contain the lower body, allowing the rising heat to steam, thus opening the pores and promoting the flow of blood and Qi for healing.</p>
<p>For chronic abscesses that have deteriorated into bone issues: use powdered Longgu to coat the ulcer on all sides, to a thickness of two fen, applying a paste to the center of the ulcer, changing it twice daily. When the worms emerge like hair, it will completely heal. Paste formula: take one dead large toad, add a chunk of chaotic hair the size of a chicken egg, and one pound of pig fat; extract the essence from the first two and decoct within the fat until almost dissolved, then let cool before adding a handful of salt, mixing it with the previous ingredients for use. Another method: burn elm bark to a powder and take it orally by the spoonful.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Li Gao&quot; mentions: Wang Shixiang from Pujin, aged seventy, was affected by cold damp from the ground. In February, he developed a bone abscess on the outer side of his left leg at the Lesser Yang point, slightly encroaching upon the Greater Yang region, measuring six to seven inches in width and one small foot in length, hard and swollen, with indistinct flesh color, skin deep, and painful to the touch down to the bone. It hurt greatly while walking. He was prescribed Chaihu and Shuzhizi each 1.5 qian, Lonicera and Cinnamon each 1 qian, Astragalus and Angelica each 2 qian, Huangbo and Licorice each 0.5 qian, and Shengma 0.7 qian, decocted with wine, and taken before a light breakfast to alleviate the pain; after a while, the pain ceased immediately. Two days later, the swelling softened and subsided.</p>
<p>Jia Demeo, a ten-year-old boy, suffered greatly from the intense heat of April. An abscess developed on the left thigh near the knee, affecting the channel of the Liver at the Inner side and slightly encroaching on the Spleen channel. The affected area exhibited indistinct flesh color, was swollen and had hard, dry skin, with severe symptoms. His pulse was thin and wiry in the three positions, felt somewhat full and slightly strong. He was treated with 2 qian of Astragalus, 1 qian each of Chaihu and Shengdi, 1.2 qian of Lonicera, and 0.3 qian each of Cinnamon and Tormentil root, and 0.2 qian of Huangbo, 0.75 qian of Angelica, decocted in wine and water, taken on an empty stomach.

The ulcer doctor Sun Yanhe examined him and said: This is a bone abscess; the opening has been delayed. I used a cautery needle to create an opening, and the pus was clear and thin. The next day, I reopened it, and he continued to suffer from reverse conditions.

I replied: It is evident and must be so. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when the pulse is thin, the skin is cold, there are diarrhea and loss of appetite, this is called the five vacuities. If one eats what is contrary, the stomach is extremely vacuous. All swellings, sores, and ulcers are indeed related to heart fire; this is a determined principle. This condition is a contradiction between internal and external factors, so one must abandon the timing and follow the symptoms; if one does not use strong, acrid, and warm medicines urgently, recovery is impossible. So it was applied, and all symptoms disappeared; appetite returned, the sores had warmth, and the pus was normal.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; says: Da Yin Du Chengqing suffered from a bone abscess, with internal pain like a needle, the external color unchanged, and the condition could not be dispelled. He was pleased that he had not used cold remedies; however, the pain had injured his stomach qi, causing him to lose his appetite. He was treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, but his food intake was still low. He took over twenty doses of the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, and when the pus collected, he used needles to remove it. He continued with a strengthened tonifying decoction, increasing the dosage of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, adding wheat, five flavors, distant will (cornflower), and fritillary bulbs in several doses, gradually stopping the pus and healing the sore. This pattern suggests that the two conditions arose from damp-heat stagnating in the flesh, preventing vital qi from transforming. Thus, the treatment should strengthen the spleen&#39;s earth, harmonize qi and blood, and with moxibustion applied at the garlic position, the abscess would resolve itself.</p>
<p>Li Hubu Mengqing had a bone abscess at the Huan Tiao point. He considered it a small sore and took a detoxifying remedy, further applying cold and cooling medicines to it. As a result, the pain intensified and caused intense eruptions of pus, leading him to realize it was an abscess. He requested treatment; upon examining his pulse, the right guan position was floating and large, indicating that his stomach qi was already injured, thus the sore opened up, the flesh was purple and sunken, and it felt cool to the touch. He mentioned that inside the sore felt slightly cold, fearing it might become a leakage. Therefore, he used cured fermented soybeans for moxibustion on it, and administered the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added patchouli, cardamom, and roasted ginger in several doses. His stomach qi gradually revived, his appetite increased, the affected area warmed up, and muscle tissue gradually began to grow; he was then treated with the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction and fully recovered.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wang Shiheng experienced swelling and pain in the lower back after childbirth, particularly severe in the legs. This was due to stagnant blood obstructing the meridians. If not treated promptly, it would surely result in bone sores. He was given two doses of Peach Kernel Decoction, which brought slight improvement; additionally, he took several doses of Myrrh Pill and recovered completely. There were also residual bad blood, with stabbing pain in the navel and abdomen, either radiating to the limbs or concentrating in the thighs, causing pain like a needle. This was due to an imbalance of hot and cold or excessive thinking and movement, leading to obstructed qi and stagnant blood in the meridians. The Myrrh Pill should be used for treatment. If the menstrual blood was not flowing, causing radiating pain in the limbs or a stabbing ache in the thighs, potentially due to dampness affecting it and swelling and pain resulting from obstructed menstrual flow, the Angelica Pill should be administered. Stagnation of bad blood is a serious condition, and if treatment is delayed, it may lead to bone sores, often resulting in death.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a bone abscess for a long time without healing, resulting in thin, short, and soft legs, with a weak and slow pulse. She was treated with the Ten Complete Tonic Decoction, adding Achyranthes, Eucommia, and aconite cake for moxibustion. After more than two months, she recovered. Generally, after pus has drained, a weak and slow pulse indicates an easier recovery due to the presence of stomach qi. A thin and deep pulse suggests a deficiency inside wanting to transform. If accompanied by irritability and pain, healing has not yet occurred. A rapidly fluctuating and coarse pulse is difficult to treat because it indicates a deficiency of righteous qi and an abundance of pathogenic qi.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a condition in his waist, which appeared but did not ulcerate. The essence and blood were only able to manifest but could not develop into pus. After administering several large doses of tonifying medicine, it began to ulcerate, and several more doses yielded pure pus. He then took a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes, amounting to over a pound, and the pus became less thick; after a few pounds, the pus gradually grew thicker, and muscle began to form. Generally, sores and abscesses rely on the essence and blood; if a condition arises without manifesting, or ulcers arise without necrosis, or do not close up, and if the pus is scant or clear, it is a sign of deficiency in essence and blood, and should be treated with strong tonics. Aggressive remedies are the most to be avoided. There are also cases where pus increases excessively, indicating that the essence and blood are too weak to contain it. If, after ulceration, there is fever and thirst, with a strong pulse and increasing pus, this is due to a deficiency of true qi and an excess of pathogenic qi, which are both untreatable. It is commonly seen that individuals with sufficient essence and blood develop sores that are swollen, red, easy to necrotize, and produce thick pus, making them easier to close up. In contrast, weak individuals frequently do not manifest, do not necrotize, and find it difficult to close up. If one carelessly administers aggressive concoctions without careful examination, the calamity of deficiency will be inevitable. After affliction, one must cultivate nourishment, especially in cases of scrofula or similar conditions, as this is particularly crucial for reinforcement. Otherwise, if other conditions arise, it will be difficult to manage, so proceed with caution!<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

I indicated that when the swelling is hard below the surface, it arises from the tendons and bones; if the flesh color does not change, it arises from the bone marrow. I then prescribed over thirty doses of ginseng and astragalus, but although the pus matured, it did not drain. I concluded that the medicinal power could not reach the area and that it must be treated with needle puncture. He did not heed my advice and only resorted to acupuncture after ten days, resulting in five to six bowls of clear pus draining out. However, due to his age, he was deficient in qi and blood, and the poison had been there for a long time, ultimately leading to his demise. Generally, when sores do not improve within ten days, one should rely on either drainage of pus, removal of necrotic tissue, or fortifying if weak; this is the essence of complete treatment.</p>

I stated that the old illness had returned, and there was nothing more to be done. It arose after his recent marriage, where he consumed fragrant and spicy meats. If he could refrain from such foods and maintain a simple diet, he might still thrive. After four to five years of pus and blood draining, the condition extended to his waist and back, leading to emptiness, and he died three years later.

I removed decayed bone from the long-standing abscess and hemorrhoids, used black chicken leg bones to mix with arsenic, secured with salt and clay, roasted until red, then extracted the toxic fire from the ground, removed the clay, ground the bones finely, made pills the size of millet, and inserted them into the orifice, applying ointment externally.</p>
<p>A woman, due to anger, experienced swelling and pain under her ribs, with pressure in her chest and a deep, slow pulse. Using a formula to alleviate qi flow, she experienced slight recovery with several doses. To this, I added a modified Xiaochaihu Decoction with additional tangerine peel, Platycodon root, and Fritillaria for several doses, leading to significant improvement. Finally, I prescribed more than twenty doses of Xiaochaihu Decoction in conjunction with Siwu Decoction, resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another man had swelling in his leg without discoloration or pain; his pulse was floating and slippery. He took a decoction to tonify the center and augment qi, with additional herbs such as pinellia, poria, bitter orange peel, and costus. He applied a compress of cyperus. He claimed there was no way to tonify qi and instead took formulas for flowing qi, which led to his deficiency worsening. He sought further treatment and took a decoction of Six Gentlemen with added angelica and a few doses. He had a poor appetite and later took tonics, recovering after more than a month. The notion that qi cannot be tonified is a common misconception. It is believed that the blockage of qi is difficult to remedy, yet they do not understand that when the vital qi is weak and cannot circulate, then the pathogenic qi stagnates and causes illness. The classics say: when the robust qi circulates, healing follows; when it stagnates, sickness arises. If one does not use supplementation, how can qi circulate?</p>
<p>A man had swelling in his arm with muscle cramps and bone pain for over a year, ultimately leading to ulceration that would not heal. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be weaker. After a small improvement with a remedy for internal congestion, he was treated with a revitalizing decoction and aconite cakes, used with moxibustion, and was subsequently healed. The essentials say: longstanding stagnation, extreme yin produces yang, cold transforms into heat, leading to more ulcers turning into fistulas; therefore, early administration of remedies for internal congestion is advisable.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from a hard arm ailment for over a year, experiencing poor appetite and thoughts, with morning chills and evening fevers. He was given Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu, Di Gu Pi, and Mu Dan Pi, and after a month, his chills and fevers had lessened. He then took the Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang and applied aconite cakes for moxibustion. After more than two months, pus formed to a point. He continued taking Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang for half a year and was cured.</p>
<p>A woman whose pus had become thin and clear, with weak pulse and aversion to cold, had long remained unhealed. She took Nei Sai San and received moxibustion with aconite cakes, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman had not been able to close up for a long time and suddenly developed chills and fevers. I diagnosed that both her qi and blood were deficient, but she instead took exterior dispersing herbs, which led to a severe fever and death. Generally, conditions of flowing and condensing are often caused by repressed emotions or sudden anger, or by a deficiency of spleen qi, with dampness reversing in the flesh, or by loose pores allowing cold evils to invade the meridians, or from falls, or postpartum blood stasis flowing to the joints, or leftover evils from febrile diseases causing harm. All these arise from insufficient true qi, which allows evil to take hold. </p>
<p>The usual treatment involves opening those who are repressed, calming those who are angry, dispersing for falls and postpartum blood stasis, eliminating and reinforcing for spleen deficiency and loose pores, and adjusting and resolving for leftover febrile evils. The main focus should be on solidifying the primordial qi, supplemented by herbs that match the symptoms. For long-standing wounds with cold at the openings, further use of fermented soy cake or aconite cakes for moxibustion is recommended. In cases with pus pathways or necrotic flesh, using a needle to disperse the decay for self-healing is very effective, particularly with an ointment. Without nourishing blood and qi, and if dietary and lifestyle habits are not carefully managed, recovery will be impossible.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

I subsequently administered a decoction of Nine Herbs, leading to a large discharge of pus. Many lumps of pus emerged, with five or six ulcers, and the flesh on his leg was entirely gone, leaving only skin and bone. After the ulcers opened, he experienced vomiting and continued fever with no appetite, so I alternated doses of the &quot;Ten Complete Great Supplements Decoction&quot; and the Nine Herbs decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man surnamed Chen, nearing thirty, had always indulged his desires and suddenly felt pain in his hip, which did not heal for over a month. I said, &quot;This is most concerning; it may lead to the issue of boils and toxins.&quot; He did not believe me and sought advice from a mediocre doctor, who mocked my words and said, &quot;Such nonsense is truly laughable. Muscular and skeletal pain is common and merely caused by wind and heat; why speak of boils and toxins?&quot; He then used medicine to dispel wind and clear heat. Half a year later, he indeed showed slight swelling and returned for treatment. I advised, &quot;Quickly use tonics to support the root; it is not too late yet.&quot; He again did not believe and consulted a sore specialist, who said, &quot;How can one warm and tonify when the swollen sore has not yet burst?&quot; He once more used remedies to clear heat and dispel toxins, and when it eventually erupted dangerously, I examined him and found both pulse and signs failed. Only then did he believe my words, regretting his previous mistakes, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>A young man surnamed Mao, not yet thirty, who indulged in wine and pleasures, suffered from a similar condition. I urged him to take medicine early, but he stubbornly refused. When his swelling turned into pus, I advised him to have it punctured quickly; yet, he feared the pain and did not comply. Unaware that pus had already formed, he listened to inferior voices recommending bitter cold detoxifying medicines, which were decidedly ineffective, leading only to deeper issues, until he awaited a spontaneous rupture and lost all vitality, making recovery impossible.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>
