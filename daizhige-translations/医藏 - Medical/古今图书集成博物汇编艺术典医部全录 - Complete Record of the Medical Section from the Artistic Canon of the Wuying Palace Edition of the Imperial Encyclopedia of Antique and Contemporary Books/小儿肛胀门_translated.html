<p><strong>Pediatric Anal Distension</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pediatric Treatment Guidelines (by Qian Yi of the Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Distention</strong></p>
<p>If there is abdominal distention accompanied by agitation and full breathing, it indicates excess, and treatments like Zishuang Pills or Baipingzi should be used. If there is no agitation or full breathing, it signifies a deficiency of the spleen. If treated improperly with purgatives, it can lead to edema in the eyes, cheeks, and limbs, and an even worse distention of the abdomen, in which case the treatment should be the Tanqi Pill. When purging leads to wheezing, it shows that the spleen&#39;s energy has become even more deficient. A weak spleen cannot control the water from the kidneys, leading to fluid retention in the limbs akin to water swelling. If this fluid invades the lungs, it results in severe wheezing. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For abdominal distention and wheezing due to deficiency of the spleen and lungs, one should use the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction. If the symptoms of swelling in the face and limbs are due to the weakness of spleen and lung energy from improper purging, one should use the modified Shenqi Pills. Furthermore, the cause of these symptoms may be due to accumulated food from wet nursing or dietary damage to the spleen, hence the Zishuang Pills and Baipingzi should only be used when the conditions are indeed excess.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The Taqi Pill is not a tonic, so it should be used with caution. If kidney heat transfers to the bladder, and the heat then inversely affects the spleen and lungs, this can lead to a weakness of the spleen and stomach, preventing them from controlling the kidney&#39;s water, resulting in swelling of the body and face. If the condition predominates above, it manifests in the lungs, causing wheezing.</p>
<p>Note: The lungs govern qi, while the kidneys govern water. The above condition can arise from insufficient constitution, from major illness, or from mistakenly inducing sweating or purging, leading to weakened spleen unable to control water, causing it to overflow into the skin, and weakened lungs unable to retain qi, which then rises excessively. For this, the Six-Flavor Pill combined with the Benefit Qi Decoction is appropriate. If there is difficulty in urination, a modified version of the Jin Kui (Golden Chamber) Kidney Qi Pill should be used. For kidney channel&#39;s empty fire rising and lung heat causing wheezing, the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill is indicated. If heart fire is flaring and causing lung heat with wheezing, the Ginseng Lung Calming Powder should be used. All these belong to the category of kidney channel&#39;s yin deficiency with heat syndrome, and the focus should be on using the Six-Flavor Pill to enrich water; using medications to clear heat will lead to mistakes.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Title: Caring for Parents in the Confucian Way</p>
<p>A child in Yan&#39;s military camp fell ill with wind and water. Various doctors used silver powder and frost powder, but he had frequent urination and could not eat, his head swollen like a belly, and his limbs were all swollen, resembling crystal. The family then sought a remedy from a Daoist. The Daoist said, &quot;This condition is different from that of a grown man. When an adult is ill with water retention, it may be due to excessive drinks or sexual activity. This child is only seven years old and has symptoms of wind and water, so he should sweat it out.&quot; </p>
<p>They placed him in a warm room, covering him entirely with a curtain to prevent him from seeing the fire. If internal heat sees external heat, he will surely become confused. He was given a large dose of a remedy for gastrointestinal wind and bathed. After the bath, he was wrapped in cloth multiple times, three to five layers, causing him to sweat profusely; his swelling reduced by half. After one or two days, they repeated the treatment, and after sweating again, the swelling decreased by seventy percent. Though he still could not eat, they used areca nut pills to adjust his condition, and the child was soon laughing as he normally would. </p>
<p>He had full-body edema.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The child exhibits swelling throughout the body, which is caused by water retention. If there is difficulty in urination, prompt urination will bring relief. The “Inner Canon” states: when the three burners are obstructed, the water pathways are not functioning, leading to fluid accumulation under the skin and swelling of the body. This is a symptom of wind combined with dampness. One can use a decoction of long-flowing water combined with the Five Ling Powder and administer it regularly; also, frequently bathe in a warm, well-ventilated place. When sweating occurs, the swelling will subside, and with the reduction of the swelling, the child will heal on their own. Sweating once reduces the condition by half, sweating again reduces it by seventy to eighty percent, and with three rounds of sweating, the issue will be resolved both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of swelling and edema, it is noted that there are two types of swelling, which arise from deficiency accompanied by accumulation. Prolonged illness without proper treatment results in gradual changes, leading to various symptoms. Depending on the severity, one must observe the condition closely and assess both exterior and interior to determine treatment: first stabilize the fundamental issue, then address the surface symptoms—this approach will ensure safety. There are damp swellings, toxic swellings, febrile swellings due to deficiency, dysentery-related swellings, Qi and blood deficiency swellings, and various other forms such as swelling due to dietary accumulation, Qi accumulation, and cold accumulation.</p>
<p>When dampness affects the spleen and stomach and is not resolved for an extended period, it causes Qi to rise and leads to swelling in the limbs and face. Food toxins can injure the spleen and stomach, causing cold and toxic accumulation in the diaphragm, which leads to swelling in the abdomen. If febrile conditions are treated too early, it can result in swelling due to internal weakness. Individuals suffering from diarrhea often have weakened spleen Qi, leading to swelling. Therefore, it is advisable to harmonize the stomach Qi, nourish the organs, and strengthen them to eliminate the swelling.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>In cases of Qi and blood deficiency with swelling, it is primarily due to stagnation in the Ren and Chong channels, weakness of the internal organs, and obstructions in the San Jiao, resulting in a lack of vitality both internally and externally. This leads to swelling in the limbs and distension in the abdomen. First, one should regulate the balance of Ying and Wei Qi, then take dispersing herbs to alleviate it. For cases of accumulated Qi causing distension, it is advisable to use Baotong with Tanqi to eliminate it; He Wan Zi can also be used for treatment. For distension from dampness and phlegm, Sanling can be used to resolve it; for locked abdomen distension, taking Zhenzhu Tianma Wan can help to alleviate it; in cases of upper abdominal fullness due to food stagnation, Sanling with Taqi and Dazhulian Wan can be effective in dispelling it; for intestinal bloating, one should use Xiaochong Wan to transform it; in cases of cold accumulation, infusing with Shenxiang should be employed for warming. For all these symptoms, one should harmonize the stomach Qi, dissolve blockages, and promote smooth passage, leading to a reduction of swelling. If there is heat present, treatment should include herbs like Tingli and Qian NIu; also, Tuiqi pills can be taken. For cases with solid heat and fullness, the Da Cheng Qi Decoction is the main treatment. Another method is to take Wuling San with Zi Shuang Wan; using the right quantity of pills based on whether there is excess or deficiency is also effective. For mild heat, the Da Chai Hu Decoction can be utilized. Wang Kentang remarked: &quot;Though ‘Baibian’ details the differentiation of symptoms, it is biased towards purgation. If one does not use methods from Qian Zhang&#39;s approach or Xue&#39;s supplementation methods as a foundation, serious harm may result; exercise caution!&quot;<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Medical Outline</strong> 【 Ming Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Swelling Disease</strong></p>
<p>Swelling disease is caused by kidney heat transmitting to the bladder. The excess heat counteracts the spleen and stomach, while a deficiency in the spleen cannot regulate it. Consequently, kidney water overcomes spleen earth, causing the spleen to follow the water. The spleen governs the limbs, leading to swelling throughout the body and face. If accompanied by wheezing, the condition is severe. Why is this so? Kidney water dominates and suppresses spleen earth, indirectly overpowering heart fire, and the heart then overcomes the lungs. Since the lungs are restrained by the heart, this causes wheezing. Some ask: if the heart constrains the lungs, and the lungs are originally weak, why is there actual wheezing? The answer is twofold: one, the lungs have significant wheezing due to the five organs being in discord; two, kidney water and qi rising invade the lungs, which leads to severe wheezing. Both conditions are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Wet Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi said: &quot;Dampness refers to water qi.&quot; The &quot;Book of the Living&quot; states: &quot;When wind and rain attack the weak, and mountain and marsh vaporize, it is not only adults who suffer from dampness; children can also be affected.&quot; This is because, since summer, children&#39;s spleens and stomachs are weak, their pores are open, and due to days of continuous rain or dampness from the ground, when children sit or lie down, they may receive hot qi. This results in a pulse that is deep and slow, physical discomfort, fever with chills, possible excessive sweating with aversion to wind, mental dullness, or possibly difficulty in urination and loose stools; if not treated for a long time, there may be drooping of the hands and feet, and if it enters the zang, they may become mute. The main treatment principle is to smooth the flow and facilitate the urination, allowing the dampness to dissipate on its own; it is not advisable to induce sweating or use severe methods.</p>
<p><strong>Untreatable Water Retention</strong></p>
<p>In all cases of water retention that initially arises in the limbs and then returns to the abdomen, it is untreatable. Symptoms include loose stools and signs such as black lips, flat lower abdomen, protruding navel, flat feet, flat back, hard flesh, flat palms, or in males, swelling from the feet upwards; and in females, swelling from the body downwards, all of which are untreatable.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Principles</strong> - Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Distension</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal distension is caused by the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, leading to an aggressive rise of qi. If the condition is real, it manifests as discomfort, restlessness, and fullness; it can be treated with Zishuang Wan and Baibingzi. [This indicates that if there is restlessness without treatment, it is a real condition and therefore can be treated. However, if treatment is mistakenly applied to a restlessness caused by deficiency, it leads to qi attaching to the lungs, which cannot be treated with purging.] If there is no restlessness, it indicates a deficiency, and purging is not appropriate. Misapplying purgatives can further weaken the spleen, causing qi to rise and attach to the lungs, resulting in both the lung and spleen being weakened. The lungs govern the eyes and face, while the spleen supports the limbs; if the deficiency is severe, there may be swelling in the eyes and face, and the limbs may appear yellow. </p>
<p>For treatment, use Taqi Wan to gradually dissolve the condition, increasing the number of pills as needed if not improved. Warming and dispersing herbs such as clove, patchouli, orange peel, and cardamom should not be used. Why is this so? If the spleen is deficient and qi has not been expelled, although there is abdominal distension, there is no restlessness, hence warming dispersing herbs can help disperse the qi from above and below for recovery. If there is deficiency and the qi has already been expelled, attaching to the lungs, the spleen and stomach are weak internally. This often leads to the generation of deficient qi, affecting the limbs and face. </p>
<p>Children are prone to fluctuations between deficiency and excess; when the spleen is deficient, they cannot tolerate heat or cold. Taking cold remedies may lead to chills, and warm remedies may induce heat. It is important to recognize this to avoid mistakes. Prolonged deficiency in the stomach can lead to jaundice or an unquenchable thirst.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>When the spleen is weak and unable to support the kidneys, the energy from the lungs rises to the limbs and face, causing swelling akin to water retention. When the kidney energy floats in the lungs, it results in severe wheezing. For this, one should use the Collapse Qi Pills and gradually increase the dosage. If, after recovery, there is no redness in the face, it indicates that weakness has not yet returned to normal. </p>
<p>For wheezing that occurs after a bowel movement, Collapse Qi Pills are recommended. If there has been no bowel movement and there is wheezing, one should encourage a bowel movement first. </p>
<p>To treat abdominal distension, it is like engaging in battle against enemies in a forest; if the enemies have not yet emerged, you can attack them effectively. However, if they have come out, do not rush to attack, as that will lead to losses. Instead, you should gradually draw in your forces, which is a wise approach. </p>
<p>The phrase &quot;enemies have not emerged from the forest&quot; refers to the situation where there is weak energy and no wheezing, and there is no swelling around the eyes and cheeks. In such cases, one may use warming herbs like clove and magnolia to disperse the energy from above and below. Once the enemies are out of the forest, if the energy is already upset and causes wheezing and swelling of the eyes and cheeks, then Collapse Qi Pills must be used to gradually alleviate these symptoms.</p>
<p>For treating children&#39;s weak abdominal distension, first administer the Collapse Qi Pills. If there is no improvement and there is food accumulation and hard stool, yellow urine, occasional wheezing, and a deep but strong pulse, they can be purged. This is because the spleen is initially weak and then accumulates. Therefore, one should first tonify the spleen, and then purge, and afterward, continue to tonify the spleen for complete recovery. If one does not first tonify the spleen and purges instead, it leads to great weakness. One should not replenish the lungs, for fear of causing virtual wheezing.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Regarding Abdominal Distention in Relation to Deficiency and Excess</p>
<p>In cases of prolonged illness, such as vomiting and diarrhea, if there is deficiency, the pulse will be weak and fine. The lungs govern the eyes and the cheeks, while the spleen governs the limbs. If one appears pale yellow, with swollen eyes and cheeks, and cold hands and feet, one should first take the Taqi Pills, followed by other formulas such as Yigong San, Hezhong Wan, Si Jun Zi Tang, or Yihuang San, using warming herbs to nourish the true qi.</p>
<p>If there is excess, the pulse will be strong and full. This may arise not only from prolonged vomiting and diarrhea but also from dysentery, with abdominal distention accompanied by shortness of breath and agitation, or with phlegm and heat present, as well as undigested food resulting in abdominal distention. In such cases, one should take Baipingzi, Dahuang Wan, and Jiedu Wan to relieve these conditions, and one must carefully check the state of urination and bowel movements. If neither is clear, one should first promote urination and then facilitate bowel movement.</p>
<p>Yunqi states: For children with internal heat and excess, characterized by abdominal distention, strong heat, red-yellow stools, and restlessness, it is advisable to use the Qingsan Pills to purge.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Dongyuan said: If there is more cold swelling and less heat swelling, it relates to the spleen and stomach; for deficiencies, one should use the Six Gentlemen Decoction. If there is shortness of breath, it indicates deficiency of spleen and lung qi, and one should use Yigong Powder to tonify. If after taking harsh medications, the shortness of breath and swelling worsen, it indicates further injury to spleen and lung qi, and one should use the previous decoction with Banxia and Shengma. If there is no shortness of breath after a bowel movement, it indicates that the evil qi has departed and lung qi has calmed; there is no need for medication. If after a long illness there is difficulty in urination or swelling in the limbs, this is due to deficiency of spleen and lung qi that cannot regulate the water pathways, and one should use Jin Kui&#39;s modified Kidney Qi Pill. If the hands and feet are cold and the eyes are exposed while sleeping, this indicates coldness in the spleen and stomach; use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus fried ginger. If the hands and feet are not cold and the eyes are exposed while sleeping, this indicates weakness in the spleen and stomach; use Six Gentlemen Decoction. If the complexion is bluish, indicating wood overcoming earth, use Six Gentlemen with Mu Xiang and Chai Hu. Additionally, one should adjust the diet of the lactating mother, as excessive intake of medicine and food might further harm the stomach qi.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Edema</p>
<pre><code>Yan Shanyun: The condition of swelling arises from a deficiency with accumulation, longstanding illness left untreated leads to gradual transformation. The symptoms are diverse, varying with severity; one must observe the ebb and flow by examining the exterior and interior to determine treatment. First, stabilize the root, then correct the superficial signs, and there will be no harm.

Zeng&#39;s Treatment Method

The origin of the edema lies in the diseases of the root and the branch. The kidneys govern vital energy, while the water of heaven nurtures it; the lungs regulate dispersion and transformation, and the metal of the earth is involved. The kidneys are the root while the lungs are the branch, both are exceedingly yin and accumulate water. When there is illness, the kidneys are the key to the stomach; if the key is ineffective, then the organs do not function properly and water fails to circulate, seeping into the vessels and skin to cause edema. One must delve into the internal and external causes for treatment. In larger patients, diagnosis is made by pulse to discern deficiency or excess. There are ten classical patterns: shortness of breath with difficulty lying down points to heart water; tight pain in the flanks indicates liver water; loose stools suggest lung water; heavy limbs relate to spleen water; low back pain with cold feet indicates kidney water; bitter mouth and dry throat suggest gallbladder water; intermittent deficiency and excess relate to large intestine water; urgent abdomen and thin limbs point to bladder water; difficulty with urination indicates stomach water; urgent fullness in the lower abdomen relates to small intestine water. A floating pulse signifies wind or deficiency; a deep pulse signifies water illness. If deep, then the vessels are deficient; if hidden, then urination is difficult, which signifies proper water.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a>
</code></pre>
<p>When the spleen pulse is weak and large, it often results in spleen enlargement; if left untreated, it can lead to edema. The spleen belongs to the earth element, favoring dryness and disliking dampness. Constant exposure to dampness harms the spleen, causing blood to transform into water. When the earth fails to control water, it accumulates and causes stagnation beneath the skin, resulting in swelling. At the onset of the condition, one may notice puffiness around the eyes in the morning that diminishes by afternoon. To address this, one can use Qiang Huo San to disperse it, followed by Shen Ling Bai Zhu San to support the spleen, and occasionally add Nanshen Fu Pi San. If the spleen is cold and weak, it should be dried with herbs like Cao Guo and Suo Sha. </p>
<p>However, this condition is relatively easier to treat in summer and autumn, but not in spring. Spring water is particularly abundant, and with the liver wood flourishing, it overcomes the spleen earth, making it unable to handle water, hence the difficulty in treatment. Progress must be gradual and adjusted carefully for effectiveness. If the spleen is hot and burdened, and heat-drying herbs are used, even though fire can nourish earth, it can also overpower water. If drying is excessive, earth cannot withstand fire, leading to increased heat and loss of appetite, with fever and thirst. If the physician continues to administer drying agents, the face and body may become puffy, resulting in spleen failure and swelling of the hands and feet.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>If the back of the hands and feet and the navel are swollen, it indicates an exterior condition beyond the spleen. If one hastily employs purgatives to alleviate this, the swelling may indeed diminish after a purge, leading to the belief that the proper remedy has been achieved. Little does one realize that the spleen, becoming more depleted as a result of the purge, will lead to a recurrence of the swelling within a month. People in this world are aware that purging the swelling is paramount but do not seek to understand that it is better to supplement ten times rather than to purge once. </p>
<p>The approach should align with the four seasons in terms of medication: in spring, use a decoction of Seven Treasures with Ephedra, Cinnamon Twig, Red Poria, and Water Ginger Scallion; in summer, a decoction of Five Poria with Ephedra, Plantago Seed, and Job&#39;s Tears; in autumn, a decoction for clearing the lungs with Chuanxiong, Asarum, and Palm-leaved Sedge; in winter, a harmonious decoction with Atractylodes, Chinese Black Phosphorus, and Red Adzuki Bean, using Water Ginger Scallion for all three decoctions. </p>
<p>Then, one should administer nourishing and water-reducing soups to assist in dispersing excess fluids; this is a sound practice. Additionally, taking the merchant&#39;s stomach pill and Red Cang Decoction in quick succession will naturally provide relief. As stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: open the gate of sickness, cleanse the organs, and balance the scales; stability is the goal—this is what is meant.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>When one first experiences phlegm cough and shortness of breath, with difficulty in urination, it pertains to the functions governed by the lungs and kidneys. Initially, one should take an exterior-releasing powder, followed by Sanbai powder for treatment. For lighter cases, one can administer Shanglu pills. Thus, the classics say: the one who is high (in condition) overcomes and transcends it, which means to induce vomiting. The lower one draws out and exhausts it, which means to promote diuresis and purge. This ailment does not arise in a day; one should not recklessly seek rapid treatment with harsh medicines, for this may lead to depletion. After recovery, if one is again exposed to external wind and experiences a floating sensation on the face, one should use the wind-dispelling decoction for resolution, while continuing to take the previous spleen-rescuing decoction to prevent relapse. </p>
<p>Dietary restrictions include avoiding salty, fermented, sour, or damp foods, all of which can promote fluid retention, as well as other raw, cold, or toxic substances. For severe cases, it may take half a year; for lighter cases, three months. It is essential for the spleen and stomach to be restored, with swelling diminished and energy replenished, before gradually reintroducing slightly roasted salt in the diet, after which the affliction will not recur. Therefore, Liu states: treating swelling is not easy, and nourishing is even more challenging, so one must carefully consider what to avoid.

<p>Exposed to dampness, swollen hands and feet, face and complexion appear puffy.<br>Eating toxic substances results in swelling of the abdomen and distended kidneys.<br>Typhoid fever causes deficiency and swelling in the abdomen.<br>Chronic dysentery results in deficiency and swelling in the abdomen.<br>These four types of ailments differ in nature, but all arise from deficiency. </p>
<p>Exposure to dampness indicates the spleen and stomach are affected by cold and are unable to transform what they should, causing qi to float in the four limbs, leading to swelling in the head and face. Consuming toxic substances harms the spleen and stomach, accumulating cold and obstructing the stomach, leading to deficiency and abdominal swelling. Too early treating typhoid causes deficiency that leads to abdominal swelling. Chronic dysentery depletes spleen qi, also resulting in swelling. </p>
<p>For these conditions, one should adjust the stomach qi, strengthen the organs, and only then can the swelling be alleviated. First, take a decoction of four ingredients to regulate the center, reduce the amount of dried ginger by half, and add white atractylodes and mulberry bark to the same decoction. For typhoid-related swelling, add bitter orange to assist breathing, and if there is weakness along with swelling from dysentery, take the Correct Qi decoction to adjust the stomach. Once the stomach qi is strengthened, using the Life-saving Pills will relieve the swelling; then further support the organs with the Guanyin powder for stabilization. </p>
<p>Qi deficiency swelling is also referred to as qi parasite.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Blood deficiency swelling, also known as blood gu.<br>When both nourishment and defense are deficient and swollen, it is also called qi and blood gu.<br>The swelling that infants suffer from is particularly urgent, and few have fully explored it in the past. The cause of swelling arises from the disorder of nourishment and defense, weakness of the organs, stagnation in the three burners, obstructing the flow through the hundred channels, with both exterior and interior being deficient, leading to confusion between pathogenic and healthy forces. Thus, it occurs. The four great symptoms: floating fullness, bloated abdomen, often arise from eating toxins, dietary issues, symptomatic injuries, or imbalances from hunger and satiety, accumulating and not transforming, resulting in this disease. The illness arises from deficiency, or else rash purging may be attempted, causing further deficiency, with the root remaining untackled, leading to an exacerbation of the condition, which is a sign of grave danger. The wise are cautious and express restraint, while the foolish attack aggressively. The two types of doctors differ, making it indeed difficult to treat. The wise discuss and negotiate, the good observe carefully, and the doubtful moderate the energy [suspecting the illness is too severe to benefit from intervention, they only moderate the energy]. The enlightened adjust accordingly [aligning with nourishment and defense]. First, stabilize the order of nourishment and defense, then administer herbal decoctions to disperse the stagnation, and the illness will be resolved.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Xue&#39;s Principles of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The ultimate yin is kidney water. The lesser yin pertains to the winter vessels. Its source is in the kidneys, and its end in the lungs, both accumulating water. It is also said: The kidneys are the gate of the stomach; if the gate is not functioning properly, water accumulates and flows in its kind. Overflowing from above and below manifests on the skin, causing swelling and abdominal distension. If one suffers from wheezing and cannot lie down, then both the root and the branch are ill. Danxi says: Only kidney deficiency cannot move water, and spleen deficiency cannot control water; the stomach and spleen unite, and the stomach is the sea of food and grains, thus if it is deficient, it cannot transform and transport. Kidney water inundates, soaking the spleen&#39;s soil, leading to stagnation in the three burners and obstruction of the channels, causing water to seep into the skin and injecting into the muscles, resulting in swelling. The appearance shows slight bulging in the eyes, heaviness in the limbs, wheezing and discomfort, coldness between the thighs, dark yellow urine, thin and shiny skin, and when pressing the hand, depressions remain, and lifting the hand brings fullness. Those affected by moisture experience swelling in all limbs and on the head and face, due to the robust energy of the spleen and stomach. Those who ingest toxins suffer from spleen injury and toxin retention in the stomach. In cases of early onset of cold damage, the evil qi enters through the gaps. After diarrhea, it indicates spleen qi deficiency. Therefore, it is essential to first regulate stomach qi, and only then can one treat the swelling.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The condition of seven types of swelling is all due to insufficient blood and qi, with weak organs and a general emptiness, causing confusion between the pathogenic and the true. This leads to edemas of the limbs and abdominal distension. One should first adjust the nourishing and protective aspects, distinguishing between yin and yang. The treatment should focus on supplementing the center and moving dampness, benefiting urination. If there is heat present, the water fluid is on the surface and can be resolved by sweating; if there is no heat, the water fluid lies within and should be purged. For swelling below the waist, promote urination; for swelling above the waist, induce sweating. This is the method of Zhang Ji.</p>
<p>If there is swelling all over the body, thirst, red and painful urination, and constipation, this is classified as yang water. If there is swelling all over without thirst, loose stools, and clear, smooth urination, this is classified as yin water. If yang water coexists with yang symptoms, the pulse will be floating and rapid; if yin water coexists with yin symptoms, the pulse will be deep and slow. If the qi sinks down, use the modified Er Chen Wan (Two Aged Pills) to lift it; if there is abdominal distension, add a little Muscone to adjust it.</p>
<p>If the condition shows looseness in the morning and urgency in the evening, it corresponds to yin deficiency; in the morning, use the Si Wu Tang (Four Substances Decoction) with added ginseng and Atractylodes, and in the evening, use the modified Shenqi Wan (Kidney Qi Pills). If it shows urgency in the morning and looseness in the evening, it corresponds to yang deficiency; in the morning, use the Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction), and in the evening, use the modified Shenqi Wan. If there is urgency both morning and evening, it indicates an absence of both yin and yang, and the Ba Zhen Tang (Eight Treasures Decoction) should be used as the primary treatment.</p>
<p>For a true yang deficiency, in the morning use the Ba Wei Di Huang Wan (Eight Ingredients Rehmannia Pills), and in the evening use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonifying the Center and Benefiting Qi Decoction). If there is abdominal fullness, swelling in the limbs, cold hands and feet, difficulty in digesting food, possible diarrhea, and cold breath, this indicates true yang collapse, with spleen, lung, and kidney deficiency and coldness, unable to control the water fluids leading to overflow. One must urgently use the modified Shenqi Wan; otherwise, the condition may not be treatable. The key lies in adjusting and tonifying the earth of the spleen, often leading to improvement.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Edema</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of edema in children: the first is gaseous edema, caused by the weakness of the spleen and stomach leading to gas attacking the abdomen. Abdominal distension mistakenly prompts the use of purgatives, resulting in the upward attachment of deficient gas to the lungs. This gas then spreads to the limbs and facial features, causing swelling. The same applies to malnutrition-related gas. The second type is water edema, resulting from excessive thirst in the upper body and uncontrollable drinking. With a weak spleen and stomach unable to regulate water, the kidneys act against the spleen, causing the earth (spleen) to follow the water, which ascends to the lungs. Since the lungs govern the skin and the spleen governs the limbs, water then flows into the skin of the limbs, causing swelling. In severe cases, kidney water can infiltrate the lungs, leading to severe coughing, which is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Edema</p>
<p>The condition of edema arises when the spleen is deficient and cannot control water, leading to the kidney&#39;s water overflowing, soaking the spleen, and causing water to seep into the skin, resulting in swelling of the muscles. Facial swelling is referred to as &quot;wind,&quot; while foot swelling is called &quot;water.&quot; If pressing causes a pit to form, and lifting the hand leads to fullness, it is significant. Dark lips indicate liver damage, while a calm heart suggests heart injury. A protruding navel points to spleen issues, flat feet indicate kidney problems, and a flat back implies lung damage. If water and heat are present on the surface, sweating is indicated; if water and coolness are internal, purging is necessary. Promoting the flow of urine and harmonizing the spleen is essential. Although purging may be considered, it should not be harsh. If the stomach shows blue veins and the abdomen is full with slippery discharge, this is called &quot;gu swelling.&quot; When swelling starts in the abdomen and then spreads to the limbs, it is favorable for purging; if it begins in the limbs and then returns to the abdomen, it is difficult to treat. In men, swelling appears in the upper body, while in women, it appears in the lower body. Hard flesh and a flat palm indicate that treatment may not be possible. It is easier to treat in autumn and spring, while winter and summer are more challenging. Severe cases may last half a year, while milder cases can take three months. Treating edema is not easy, and nourishing the body is especially difficult. For swelling below the waist, promote urination; for swelling above the waist, sweating is required.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Abdominal Distension</strong></p>
<p>In children, abdominal distension can be either due to deficiency or excess. If there is difficulty in urination, accompanied by feelings of oppression and urgent panting, this is due to excess evil qi, and one should use Fenqi Drink or Taqi Pills. If urination flows freely without panting, but the face and limbs are swollen, this indicates a deficiency of righteous qi. This may be from prolonged malaria or dysentery, or from dietary harm to the spleen, causing chaotic flow of deficient qi. One should use Spleen Supplement Drink or Li Zhong Decoction with added Grass Fruit, Sand Ginger, and Fennel Seed.</p>

This leads to swelling in the limbs, head, face, hands, and feet, resulting in symptoms like shortness of breath, and thus it is advisable to take this medicine.</p>
<p>The ingredients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese angelica</li>
<li>Cooked and dried rehmannia (cleaned)</li>
<li>Ginseng</li>
<li>White poria</li>
<li>Sichuan lovage</li>
<li>Atractylodes</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice</li>
<li>White peony</li>
<li>Bitter orange (stir-fried separately)</li>
<li>Honey-fried astragalus</li>
<li>Aged tangerine peel</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these should be taken in equal parts (according to the measurement of your mouth), with each dose consisting of two qian (a traditional measure) in water (about a small cup), simmered down to half a cup, strained, and taken at any time without restriction.</p>
<p>The explanation states: The &quot;Rong&quot; represents blood that flows warm through the vessels, while &quot;Wei&quot; pertains to the harmonious adjustment of Qi in the channels. Therefore, Rong circulates within the vessels, and Wei functions externally. The harmony between Yin and Yang promotes uninterrupted circulation, persisting from childhood to adulthood, tied to breathing with no hindrance. When the vessels are balanced, Qi flows smoothly. If there is resistance in breathing or obstruction in the flow of Qi, it can lead to hidden issues in the organs, causing numerous ailments.</p>
<p>This formula is excellent, even suitable for young children, to strengthen their foundation, ensuring that blood, Qi, and Wei are both balanced and harmonious. It addresses coldness in the organs and weakness in vitality while promoting warmth and strength. This balance maintains natural equilibrium, offsets deficiencies, regulates weakness into strength, and creates a harmonious balance of Yin and Yang, filling the channels with Qi. Thus, what diseases could arise?<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>For the treatment of children&#39;s swelling accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, restlessness in sitting or lying, swelling in the limbs, vomiting of food, and lethargy with a tendency to sleep:</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five-flavor fruit</li>
<li>Platycodon root</li>
<li>White poria</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice</li>
<li>Aged tangerine peel</li>
<li>Mulberry bark</li>

<li>Sichuan angelica</li>
<li>Purple perilla</li>
<li>Perilla seeds</li>
<li>Half summer small breed</li>
</ul>
<p>Take equal portions of the above, chew them together. For each dose, take two large money spoons with a small cup of water, add two small slices of ginger and half a date. Boil until reduced to half a cup, strain out the residue, and take it without restriction on timing, along with eight flavors of regulating middle pills.</p>
<p>It is advised: Keep the clear and turbid separate, the evil and good distinct; the upper body receives cooling while the lower body is warmed. If qi stagnates, there will be less movement up and down, and if blood is deficient, there will be excessive flow. Even if an infant breathes one breath, the pulse is gradually responsive and does not deviate from its normal count; it parallels that of adults but is merely shorter and lighter. Should there be stagnation, the pulse will be slow, leading to illness from being overly excessive or insufficient. A skilled healer will disperse stagnation, follow reversal, promote flow when stoppage occurs, reduce when there is stagnation, and ultimately harmonize the treatment, paying attention to fulfilling the qi. In general, when an infant&#39;s qi is smooth, it is easier to treat. This formula differentiates between dispersing qi and managing food and water, which discerning individuals will understand!<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Great Efficacy Divine Medicine for Life-Saving Pill</p>

First, use a large An Wan to induce vomiting and diarrhea to relieve the stagnation.

Treat this with Liu Jun Zi Tang and add a hook of Jiaoteng for recovery.</p>
<p>A young child has abdominal distension, fever, and irritability, with a pulse that resembles a circular pearl. When the abdomen is pressed, the child cries; this indicates spleen and stomach deficiency leading to food stagnation. First, administer a dose of Bao He Wan.

Use Wu Wei Yi Gong San with Chai Hu to treat, resulting in prompt recovery.</p>
<p>A young child frequently experiences dry vomiting, refuses milk and food, and exhibits abdominal bloating, resembling a snake; this indicates spleen and stomach deficiency leading to malnutrition.

I administered a modified Renowned Energy Decoction with added cloves and hook vine to warm and supplement the spleen&#39;s energy, suppress the rebellious liver wood, and after several doses, there was gradual improvement. Furthermore, I used a modified Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger to treat him, and he became stable. During this time, we frequently employed medications composed of various minerals and musk to dispel the ailment; however, there were numerous cases that turned critical and perished, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>Another child, aged eight, had an enlarged abdomen with a protruding navel, blood in the stool resembling dysentery, scant urination, a yellowish complexion, and red cheeks. This was due to food accumulation harming the spleen, combined with liver wood attacking spleen earth. When the spleen suffers, lung energy becomes deficient and cannot produce kidney water, leading to these symptoms. The first step was to eliminate the accumulation, thus I prescribed a powdered form of Jieyu Pill with added Sparganium and Artemisia three qian, mixed in light ginger soup, and taken with two teaspoons of wine, resulting in sounds from the abdomen and immediate relief of urination and defecation. Afterward, taking another two qian, the abdominal swelling decreased significantly. Next, I used two qian of Da&#39;an Pill powder, which entirely resolved the navel swelling and stopped the blood in stool. After consuming a small bowl of thin porridge, the child suddenly felt distended in the abdomen, nausea, and could not expel phlegm; this was due to spleen deficiency leading to failure in transformation resulting in phlegm accumulation. I then used two qian of the Six Gentlemen Powder, which, when mixed with ginger soup, nourished the qi, and gradually resumed food intake. However, by evening, due to heat and fatigue, there was a sensation of abdominal swelling, a consequence of the spleen deficiency affecting the yin, so I used the Renowned Energy Decoction to effect a cure.

<p>Another young child, inheriting kidney heat from the father, had red and painful urination. After taking a formula like Wu Ling San, he later faced food retention and took harsh purging medicines, resulting in swelling of the limbs and face, and difficulty urinating, leading to gradual respiratory distress.

Upon food injury again, with abdominal distension and pain, the use of purgative medicines provided temporary pain relief but worsened the distension and increased respiratory distress. This was due to further injury to the spleen, leading to increased lung deficiency. Liu Jun Zi Tang with additions of Jie Geng for adjustment and support was used, and the child recovered.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>A young child experienced abdominal distension, poor appetite, fever, and nausea, resembling an exterior pathogen. I said: This is due to injury from food, with weakness and heat in the spleen and lungs. I prescribed one dose of Baohuan Pill, and all symptoms quickly subsided, but the abdomen remained distended. I then used Yigong Powder for recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had food injury leading to abdominal distension, took a purging remedy, resulting in difficulty with urination; after taking a blend similar to Wuling Powder, their appetite gradually diminished, and urination became blocked, leading to sudden swelling in the limbs. I used Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan in the morning and Yigong Powder in the evening, and they recovered.</p>
<p>Another child presented with abdominal distension, a red face, phlegm wheezing, constipation, and severe heat with a preference for cold drinks. This condition was predominantly excess, so I prescribed one dose of Zishuang Pill, but all symptoms worsened, leading to a pale face despite an ongoing desire for soup. I concluded that the evil qi had retreated, yet the true qi was also harmed, hence the pale face and craving for soup. I used a large dose of Baizhu Powder to prepare broth, allowing free drinking, and after a long while, they slept well and felt stable the next day.</p>
<p>A child exhibited abdominal distension, urinated pale blue, had a mass on the left side of the abdomen, a sallow complexion, red and decayed gums, and a diminished appetite. I used Yigong Powder to adjust and tonify the middle qi as the main treatment, supplemented with Jiuwéi Luhui Wan, and applied Ferula paste externally. After two days, the mass dissipated, with slight pain on the left side. I used Sijunzi Decoction and Datuo Decoction to clear damp-heat. After a month, all symptoms slightly improved, and I continued with Yigong Powder and Ke&#39;Ma Wan until full recovery.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　腹胀而闷乱喘满者，实也，用紫霜丸、白饼子。若不闷乱喘满者，脾虚也，误下之，以致目胞腮面四肢浮肿，肚腹愈胀，以塌气丸主之。因下而喘，脾气益虚也。脾虚不能胜肾水，随肺气行于四肢如水状。若侵浮于肺，即大喘也。　　【 注　按腹胀喘满，脾肺虚而气不归源者，用补中益气汤。若因下脾肺气虚，而面目四肢浮肿等证者，用金匮加减肾气丸。况此证有因乳母脾胃宿积，饮食伤脾所致，其白饼子、紫霜丸，必形病俱实，方可用。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>塌气丸亦非调补之剂，宜审用之。】　　若肾热传于膀胱，热甚逆于脾肺，脾胃虚而不能制肾水，流走四肢，而身面皆肿；若上胜则形于肺，故令喘也。　　 【 注　按肺主气，肾主水。前证因禀赋不足，或因大病后，或误行汗下，致脾虚不能制水而溢皮肤，肺虚不能摄气而气上逆，宜用六味丸补中益气汤治之。如小便不利，用金匮加减肾气丸。肾经虚火上炎，肺热作喘者，用六味地黄丸。心火炽盛，肺热作喘者，用人参平肺散。凡此皆属肾经阴虚热证，用六味丸壮水为主，若用清热分利之药则误矣。】<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　　　儒门事亲 【 元张从政】</p>

<p>　　郾之营兵秋家小儿病风水，诸医用银粉、粉霜之药，小溲反濇，饮食不进，头肿如腹，四肢皆满，状若水晶。家人乃为勉强求治于戴人。戴人曰：此证不与壮年同。壮年病水者，或因留饮及房室。此小儿才七岁，乃风水证也，宜出汗。乃置燠室，以屏帐遍遮之，不令见火。若内火见外火，必昏愦也。使大服胃风汤而浴之，浴讫，以布单重复之，凡三五重，其汗如水，肿乃减五分。隔一二日，乃依前治之，汗出肿减七分，乃二汗而全减，尚未能食，以槟榔丸调之，儿已喜笑如常日矣。<br>　　　　　通身浮肿<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<p>　　小儿通身浮肿，是水气肿也。小便不利者，通小便则愈。《内经》曰：三焦闭塞，水道不行，水满皮肤，身体否肿。是风乘湿之证也。可用长流水加灯心煎五苓散，时时灌之；更于不透风暖处频浴，汗出则肿消，肿消则自愈。一汗减半，再汗减七八分，三汗消尽，内外兼治故也。<br>　　　　婴童百问 【 明鲁伯嗣】</p>

<p>　　　　　肿病</p>
<p>　　肿病肾热传于膀胱，热盛逆于脾胃，脾虚而不能制，肾水反克脾土，脾随水行，脾主四肢，故流走而身面皆肿也。若加喘者重也。何以然？肾水胜而克退脾土，反胜心火，心又胜肺，肺为心克，故喘。或问曰：心刑肺，肺本见虚，今何喘实？曰：此有二：一者肺大喘，此五脏逆；二者肾水气上行，傍侵肺，故令大喘。此皆难治。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　古今医统 【 明徐春甫】</p>

<p>　　凡水肿先起于四肢，而后归于腹者，不治。大便滑泄，与夫唇黑、缺盆平、脐突、足平、背平，或肉硬，或手掌平，或男从脚下肿而上，女从身上肿而下，并皆不治。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【 明王肯堂】</p>

<p>　　原肿病之由，标本之疾，肾主元气，天一之水生焉；肺主冲化，地四之金属焉。肾为本而肺为标，皆至阴以积水。其为病也，肾者胃之关键，关键不利，枢机不转，水乃不行，渗于脉络皮肤而为浮肿，当推究内外所因而为施治。儿大者凭脉以明虚实。古方有十种论证，短气不得卧为心水，两胁紧痛为肝水，大便鸭溏为肺水，四肢苦重为脾水，腰痛足冷为肾水，口苦咽干为胆水，乍虚乍实为大肠水，腹急肢瘦为膀胱水，小便闭濇为胃水，小腹急满为小肠水。然脉浮为风为虚；沉伏为水病，沉则脉络虚，伏则小便难，即为正水。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>脾脉虚大，多作脾肿，因循不治，乃成水肿。盖脾属土，喜燥而恶湿，常感湿气，湿喜伤脾，血化为水，土败不能制水，则停蓄不行，留滞皮肤，故作浮肿。初得病时，见眼泡早晨浮突，至午后稍消，以羌活散疏解，次醒脾汤主之，及间投南星腹皮散。其脾冷困，则燥以草果、缩砂之类。然此证夏与秋冬治之颇易，惟春不然，盖四时之水，无如春水泛溢，兼肝木旺而脾土受克，不能受水，所以难疗。进退不常，须徐徐调理取效。若脾热而困，又有热药燥之，虽火能生土，亦可胜水。奈何燥之太过，土不敌火，则热愈甚而不食，发热烦渴，医者又进之以燥剂，由此而面目转浮，致脾败而手足背皆肿。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>盖手足背与脐凸，即脾之外候，有未经发表，遽用下药以泻之，则一泻而肿消，乃曰得泻之力，殊不知脾愈泻而愈虚，不逾旬月，其肿如初。此世人即知泻肿为最，而不求其十补勿一泻之论。法当随四时用药，解表通利小便，春以七宝散加麻黄、桂枝、赤茯苓、水姜葱煎服；夏以五苓散加麻黄、车前子、薏苡仁；秋以清肺饮加羌活、细辛、商陆；冬以冲和饮加白朮、生川乌、赤小豆，以上三药，并用水姜葱煎。次投滋润救脾导水汤剂渗泄之，乃为良法。更以商陆胃苓丸、赤苍饮顿服，自然获安。盖《内经》云：开鬼门，洁净府，平治权衡，以平为期，此之谓也。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　有初中便觉痰嗽气喘，小水不通，正属肺肾所主，先服解表散，次以三白散为治。余证轻者投商陆丸。故经曰：其高者因而越之，即涌吐之义也。下者引而竭之，即渗泻之义也。凡得此病，非一朝一夕之故，不可以孟浪之药，求其速效，以致虚脱。如愈后。再感外风，满面虚浮，用排风汤和解，仍服前救脾汤剂，免致反复。饮食之忌，惟盐酱虀酢湿面，皆味咸能溢水者，并其他生冷毒物，亦宜戒之，重则半载，轻则三月，须脾胃平复，肿消气实，然后于饮食中旋以烧盐少投，则其疾自不再作。故刘氏曰：治肿非易，补养尤难，所忌者切须详审。有经久不消者，下浚川丸即效。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　　演山治法</p>

<p><strong>Pediatric Anal Distension</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pediatric Treatment Guidelines (by Qian Yi of the Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abdominal Distention</strong></p>
<p>If there is abdominal distention accompanied by agitation and full breathing, it indicates excess, and treatments like Zishuang Pills or Baipingzi should be used. If there is no agitation or full breathing, it signifies a deficiency of the spleen. If treated improperly with purgatives, it can lead to edema in the eyes, cheeks, and limbs, and an even worse distention of the abdomen, in which case the treatment should be the Tanqi Pill. When purging leads to wheezing, it shows that the spleen&#39;s energy has become even more deficient. A weak spleen cannot control the water from the kidneys, leading to fluid retention in the limbs akin to water swelling. If this fluid invades the lungs, it results in severe wheezing. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For abdominal distention and wheezing due to deficiency of the spleen and lungs, one should use the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction. If the symptoms of swelling in the face and limbs are due to the weakness of spleen and lung energy from improper purging, one should use the modified Shenqi Pills. Furthermore, the cause of these symptoms may be due to accumulated food from wet nursing or dietary damage to the spleen, hence the Zishuang Pills and Baipingzi should only be used when the conditions are indeed excess.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Taqi Pill is not a tonic, so it should be used with caution. If kidney heat transfers to the bladder, and the heat then inversely affects the spleen and lungs, this can lead to a weakness of the spleen and stomach, preventing them from controlling the kidney&#39;s water, resulting in swelling of the body and face. If the condition predominates above, it manifests in the lungs, causing wheezing.</p>
<p>Note: The lungs govern qi, while the kidneys govern water. The above condition can arise from insufficient constitution, from major illness, or from mistakenly inducing sweating or purging, leading to weakened spleen unable to control water, causing it to overflow into the skin, and weakened lungs unable to retain qi, which then rises excessively. For this, the Six-Flavor Pill combined with the Benefit Qi Decoction is appropriate. If there is difficulty in urination, a modified version of the Jin Kui (Golden Chamber) Kidney Qi Pill should be used. For kidney channel&#39;s empty fire rising and lung heat causing wheezing, the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill is indicated. If heart fire is flaring and causing lung heat with wheezing, the Ginseng Lung Calming Powder should be used. All these belong to the category of kidney channel&#39;s yin deficiency with heat syndrome, and the focus should be on using the Six-Flavor Pill to enrich water; using medications to clear heat will lead to mistakes.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Title: Caring for Parents in the Confucian Way</p>
<p>A child in Yan&#39;s military camp fell ill with wind and water. Various doctors used silver powder and frost powder, but he had frequent urination and could not eat, his head swollen like a belly, and his limbs were all swollen, resembling crystal. The family then sought a remedy from a Daoist. The Daoist said, &quot;This condition is different from that of a grown man. When an adult is ill with water retention, it may be due to excessive drinks or sexual activity. This child is only seven years old and has symptoms of wind and water, so he should sweat it out.&quot; </p>
<p>They placed him in a warm room, covering him entirely with a curtain to prevent him from seeing the fire. If internal heat sees external heat, he will surely become confused. He was given a large dose of a remedy for gastrointestinal wind and bathed. After the bath, he was wrapped in cloth multiple times, three to five layers, causing him to sweat profusely; his swelling reduced by half. After one or two days, they repeated the treatment, and after sweating again, the swelling decreased by seventy percent. Though he still could not eat, they used areca nut pills to adjust his condition, and the child was soon laughing as he normally would. </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The child exhibits swelling throughout the body, which is caused by water retention. If there is difficulty in urination, prompt urination will bring relief. The “Inner Canon” states: when the three burners are obstructed, the water pathways are not functioning, leading to fluid accumulation under the skin and swelling of the body. This is a symptom of wind combined with dampness. One can use a decoction of long-flowing water combined with the Five Ling Powder and administer it regularly; also, frequently bathe in a warm, well-ventilated place. When sweating occurs, the swelling will subside, and with the reduction of the swelling, the child will heal on their own. Sweating once reduces the condition by half, sweating again reduces it by seventy to eighty percent, and with three rounds of sweating, the issue will be resolved both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of swelling and edema, it is noted that there are two types of swelling, which arise from deficiency accompanied by accumulation. Prolonged illness without proper treatment results in gradual changes, leading to various symptoms. Depending on the severity, one must observe the condition closely and assess both exterior and interior to determine treatment: first stabilize the fundamental issue, then address the surface symptoms—this approach will ensure safety. There are damp swellings, toxic swellings, febrile swellings due to deficiency, dysentery-related swellings, Qi and blood deficiency swellings, and various other forms such as swelling due to dietary accumulation, Qi accumulation, and cold accumulation.</p>
<p>When dampness affects the spleen and stomach and is not resolved for an extended period, it causes Qi to rise and leads to swelling in the limbs and face. Food toxins can injure the spleen and stomach, causing cold and toxic accumulation in the diaphragm, which leads to swelling in the abdomen. If febrile conditions are treated too early, it can result in swelling due to internal weakness. Individuals suffering from diarrhea often have weakened spleen Qi, leading to swelling. Therefore, it is advisable to harmonize the stomach Qi, nourish the organs, and strengthen them to eliminate the swelling.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of Qi and blood deficiency with swelling, it is primarily due to stagnation in the Ren and Chong channels, weakness of the internal organs, and obstructions in the San Jiao, resulting in a lack of vitality both internally and externally. This leads to swelling in the limbs and distension in the abdomen. First, one should regulate the balance of Ying and Wei Qi, then take dispersing herbs to alleviate it. For cases of accumulated Qi causing distension, it is advisable to use Baotong with Tanqi to eliminate it; He Wan Zi can also be used for treatment. For distension from dampness and phlegm, Sanling can be used to resolve it; for locked abdomen distension, taking Zhenzhu Tianma Wan can help to alleviate it; in cases of upper abdominal fullness due to food stagnation, Sanling with Taqi and Dazhulian Wan can be effective in dispelling it; for intestinal bloating, one should use Xiaochong Wan to transform it; in cases of cold accumulation, infusing with Shenxiang should be employed for warming. For all these symptoms, one should harmonize the stomach Qi, dissolve blockages, and promote smooth passage, leading to a reduction of swelling. If there is heat present, treatment should include herbs like Tingli and Qian NIu; also, Tuiqi pills can be taken. For cases with solid heat and fullness, the Da Cheng Qi Decoction is the main treatment. Another method is to take Wuling San with Zi Shuang Wan; using the right quantity of pills based on whether there is excess or deficiency is also effective. For mild heat, the Da Chai Hu Decoction can be utilized. Wang Kentang remarked: &quot;Though ‘Baibian’ details the differentiation of symptoms, it is biased towards purgation. If one does not use methods from Qian Zhang&#39;s approach or Xue&#39;s supplementation methods as a foundation, serious harm may result; exercise caution!&quot;<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Outline</strong> 【 Ming Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Swelling Disease</strong></p>
<p>Swelling disease is caused by kidney heat transmitting to the bladder. The excess heat counteracts the spleen and stomach, while a deficiency in the spleen cannot regulate it. Consequently, kidney water overcomes spleen earth, causing the spleen to follow the water. The spleen governs the limbs, leading to swelling throughout the body and face. If accompanied by wheezing, the condition is severe. Why is this so? Kidney water dominates and suppresses spleen earth, indirectly overpowering heart fire, and the heart then overcomes the lungs. Since the lungs are restrained by the heart, this causes wheezing. Some ask: if the heart constrains the lungs, and the lungs are originally weak, why is there actual wheezing? The answer is twofold: one, the lungs have significant wheezing due to the five organs being in discord; two, kidney water and qi rising invade the lungs, which leads to severe wheezing. Both conditions are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chao Shi said: &quot;Dampness refers to water qi.&quot; The &quot;Book of the Living&quot; states: &quot;When wind and rain attack the weak, and mountain and marsh vaporize, it is not only adults who suffer from dampness; children can also be affected.&quot; This is because, since summer, children&#39;s spleens and stomachs are weak, their pores are open, and due to days of continuous rain or dampness from the ground, when children sit or lie down, they may receive hot qi. This results in a pulse that is deep and slow, physical discomfort, fever with chills, possible excessive sweating with aversion to wind, mental dullness, or possibly difficulty in urination and loose stools; if not treated for a long time, there may be drooping of the hands and feet, and if it enters the zang, they may become mute. The main treatment principle is to smooth the flow and facilitate the urination, allowing the dampness to dissipate on its own; it is not advisable to induce sweating or use severe methods.</p>
<p><strong>Untreatable Water Retention</strong></p>
<p>In all cases of water retention that initially arises in the limbs and then returns to the abdomen, it is untreatable. Symptoms include loose stools and signs such as black lips, flat lower abdomen, protruding navel, flat feet, flat back, hard flesh, flat palms, or in males, swelling from the feet upwards; and in females, swelling from the body downwards, all of which are untreatable.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Abdominal Distension</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal distension is caused by the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, leading to an aggressive rise of qi. If the condition is real, it manifests as discomfort, restlessness, and fullness; it can be treated with Zishuang Wan and Baibingzi. [This indicates that if there is restlessness without treatment, it is a real condition and therefore can be treated. However, if treatment is mistakenly applied to a restlessness caused by deficiency, it leads to qi attaching to the lungs, which cannot be treated with purging.] If there is no restlessness, it indicates a deficiency, and purging is not appropriate. Misapplying purgatives can further weaken the spleen, causing qi to rise and attach to the lungs, resulting in both the lung and spleen being weakened. The lungs govern the eyes and face, while the spleen supports the limbs; if the deficiency is severe, there may be swelling in the eyes and face, and the limbs may appear yellow. </p>
<p>For treatment, use Taqi Wan to gradually dissolve the condition, increasing the number of pills as needed if not improved. Warming and dispersing herbs such as clove, patchouli, orange peel, and cardamom should not be used. Why is this so? If the spleen is deficient and qi has not been expelled, although there is abdominal distension, there is no restlessness, hence warming dispersing herbs can help disperse the qi from above and below for recovery. If there is deficiency and the qi has already been expelled, attaching to the lungs, the spleen and stomach are weak internally. This often leads to the generation of deficient qi, affecting the limbs and face. </p>
<p>Children are prone to fluctuations between deficiency and excess; when the spleen is deficient, they cannot tolerate heat or cold. Taking cold remedies may lead to chills, and warm remedies may induce heat. It is important to recognize this to avoid mistakes. Prolonged deficiency in the stomach can lead to jaundice or an unquenchable thirst.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen is weak and unable to support the kidneys, the energy from the lungs rises to the limbs and face, causing swelling akin to water retention. When the kidney energy floats in the lungs, it results in severe wheezing. For this, one should use the Collapse Qi Pills and gradually increase the dosage. If, after recovery, there is no redness in the face, it indicates that weakness has not yet returned to normal. </p>
<p>For wheezing that occurs after a bowel movement, Collapse Qi Pills are recommended. If there has been no bowel movement and there is wheezing, one should encourage a bowel movement first. </p>
<p>To treat abdominal distension, it is like engaging in battle against enemies in a forest; if the enemies have not yet emerged, you can attack them effectively. However, if they have come out, do not rush to attack, as that will lead to losses. Instead, you should gradually draw in your forces, which is a wise approach. </p>
<p>The phrase &quot;enemies have not emerged from the forest&quot; refers to the situation where there is weak energy and no wheezing, and there is no swelling around the eyes and cheeks. In such cases, one may use warming herbs like clove and magnolia to disperse the energy from above and below. Once the enemies are out of the forest, if the energy is already upset and causes wheezing and swelling of the eyes and cheeks, then Collapse Qi Pills must be used to gradually alleviate these symptoms.</p>
<p>For treating children&#39;s weak abdominal distension, first administer the Collapse Qi Pills. If there is no improvement and there is food accumulation and hard stool, yellow urine, occasional wheezing, and a deep but strong pulse, they can be purged. This is because the spleen is initially weak and then accumulates. Therefore, one should first tonify the spleen, and then purge, and afterward, continue to tonify the spleen for complete recovery. If one does not first tonify the spleen and purges instead, it leads to great weakness. One should not replenish the lungs, for fear of causing virtual wheezing.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of prolonged illness, such as vomiting and diarrhea, if there is deficiency, the pulse will be weak and fine. The lungs govern the eyes and the cheeks, while the spleen governs the limbs.

<p>If there is excess, the pulse will be strong and full. This may arise not only from prolonged vomiting and diarrhea but also from dysentery, with abdominal distention accompanied by shortness of breath and agitation, or with phlegm and heat present, as well as undigested food resulting in abdominal distention. In such cases, one should take Baipingzi, Dahuang Wan, and Jiedu Wan to relieve these conditions, and one must carefully check the state of urination and bowel movements. If neither is clear, one should first promote urination and then facilitate bowel movement.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Edema</p>
<pre><code>Yan Shanyun: The condition of swelling arises from a deficiency with accumulation, longstanding illness left untreated leads to gradual transformation. The symptoms are diverse, varying with severity; one must observe the ebb and flow by examining the exterior and interior to determine treatment. First, stabilize the root, then correct the superficial signs, and there will be no harm.

Zeng&#39;s Treatment Method

The origin of the edema lies in the diseases of the root and the branch. The kidneys govern vital energy, while the water of heaven nurtures it; the lungs regulate dispersion and transformation, and the metal of the earth is involved. The kidneys are the root while the lungs are the branch, both are exceedingly yin and accumulate water. When there is illness, the kidneys are the key to the stomach; if the key is ineffective, then the organs do not function properly and water fails to circulate, seeping into the vessels and skin to cause edema. One must delve into the internal and external causes for treatment. In larger patients, diagnosis is made by pulse to discern deficiency or excess. There are ten classical patterns: shortness of breath with difficulty lying down points to heart water; tight pain in the flanks indicates liver water; loose stools suggest lung water; heavy limbs relate to spleen water; low back pain with cold feet indicates kidney water; bitter mouth and dry throat suggest gallbladder water; intermittent deficiency and excess relate to large intestine water; urgent abdomen and thin limbs point to bladder water; difficulty with urination indicates stomach water; urgent fullness in the lower abdomen relates to small intestine water. A floating pulse signifies wind or deficiency; a deep pulse signifies water illness. If deep, then the vessels are deficient; if hidden, then urination is difficult, which signifies proper water.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen pulse is weak and large, it often results in spleen enlargement; if left untreated, it can lead to edema. The spleen belongs to the earth element, favoring dryness and disliking dampness. Constant exposure to dampness harms the spleen, causing blood to transform into water. When the earth fails to control water, it accumulates and causes stagnation beneath the skin, resulting in swelling. At the onset of the condition, one may notice puffiness around the eyes in the morning that diminishes by afternoon. To address this, one can use Qiang Huo San to disperse it, followed by Shen Ling Bai Zhu San to support the spleen, and occasionally add Nanshen Fu Pi San. If the spleen is cold and weak, it should be dried with herbs like Cao Guo and Suo Sha. </p>
<p>However, this condition is relatively easier to treat in summer and autumn, but not in spring. Spring water is particularly abundant, and with the liver wood flourishing, it overcomes the spleen earth, making it unable to handle water, hence the difficulty in treatment. Progress must be gradual and adjusted carefully for effectiveness. If the spleen is hot and burdened, and heat-drying herbs are used, even though fire can nourish earth, it can also overpower water. If drying is excessive, earth cannot withstand fire, leading to increased heat and loss of appetite, with fever and thirst. If the physician continues to administer drying agents, the face and body may become puffy, resulting in spleen failure and swelling of the hands and feet.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the back of the hands and feet and the navel are swollen, it indicates an exterior condition beyond the spleen. If one hastily employs purgatives to alleviate this, the swelling may indeed diminish after a purge, leading to the belief that the proper remedy has been achieved. Little does one realize that the spleen, becoming more depleted as a result of the purge, will lead to a recurrence of the swelling within a month. People in this world are aware that purging the swelling is paramount but do not seek to understand that it is better to supplement ten times rather than to purge once. </p>
<p>The approach should align with the four seasons in terms of medication: in spring, use a decoction of Seven Treasures with Ephedra, Cinnamon Twig, Red Poria, and Water Ginger Scallion; in summer, a decoction of Five Poria with Ephedra, Plantago Seed, and Job&#39;s Tears; in autumn, a decoction for clearing the lungs with Chuanxiong, Asarum, and Palm-leaved Sedge; in winter, a harmonious decoction with Atractylodes, Chinese Black Phosphorus, and Red Adzuki Bean, using Water Ginger Scallion for all three decoctions. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one first experiences phlegm cough and shortness of breath, with difficulty in urination, it pertains to the functions governed by the lungs and kidneys. Initially, one should take an exterior-releasing powder, followed by Sanbai powder for treatment. For lighter cases, one can administer Shanglu pills. Thus, the classics say: the one who is high (in condition) overcomes and transcends it, which means to induce vomiting. The lower one draws out and exhausts it, which means to promote diuresis and purge. This ailment does not arise in a day; one should not recklessly seek rapid treatment with harsh medicines, for this may lead to depletion. After recovery, if one is again exposed to external wind and experiences a floating sensation on the face, one should use the wind-dispelling decoction for resolution, while continuing to take the previous spleen-rescuing decoction to prevent relapse. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Xue&#39;s Principles of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The ultimate yin is kidney water. The lesser yin pertains to the winter vessels. Its source is in the kidneys, and its end in the lungs, both accumulating water. It is also said: The kidneys are the gate of the stomach; if the gate is not functioning properly, water accumulates and flows in its kind. Overflowing from above and below manifests on the skin, causing swelling and abdominal distension. If one suffers from wheezing and cannot lie down, then both the root and the branch are ill. Danxi says: Only kidney deficiency cannot move water, and spleen deficiency cannot control water; the stomach and spleen unite, and the stomach is the sea of food and grains, thus if it is deficient, it cannot transform and transport. Kidney water inundates, soaking the spleen&#39;s soil, leading to stagnation in the three burners and obstruction of the channels, causing water to seep into the skin and injecting into the muscles, resulting in swelling. The appearance shows slight bulging in the eyes, heaviness in the limbs, wheezing and discomfort, coldness between the thighs, dark yellow urine, thin and shiny skin, and when pressing the hand, depressions remain, and lifting the hand brings fullness. Those affected by moisture experience swelling in all limbs and on the head and face, due to the robust energy of the spleen and stomach. Those who ingest toxins suffer from spleen injury and toxin retention in the stomach. In cases of early onset of cold damage, the evil qi enters through the gaps. After diarrhea, it indicates spleen qi deficiency. Therefore, it is essential to first regulate stomach qi, and only then can one treat the swelling.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of seven types of swelling is all due to insufficient blood and qi, with weak organs and a general emptiness, causing confusion between the pathogenic and the true. This leads to edemas of the limbs and abdominal distension. One should first adjust the nourishing and protective aspects, distinguishing between yin and yang. The treatment should focus on supplementing the center and moving dampness, benefiting urination. If there is heat present, the water fluid is on the surface and can be resolved by sweating; if there is no heat, the water fluid lies within and should be purged. For swelling below the waist, promote urination; for swelling above the waist, induce sweating. This is the method of Zhang Ji.</p>
<p>If there is swelling all over the body, thirst, red and painful urination, and constipation, this is classified as yang water. If there is swelling all over without thirst, loose stools, and clear, smooth urination, this is classified as yin water. If yang water coexists with yang symptoms, the pulse will be floating and rapid; if yin water coexists with yin symptoms, the pulse will be deep and slow. If the qi sinks down, use the modified Er Chen Wan (Two Aged Pills) to lift it; if there is abdominal distension, add a little Muscone to adjust it.</p>
<p>If the condition shows looseness in the morning and urgency in the evening, it corresponds to yin deficiency; in the morning, use the Si Wu Tang (Four Substances Decoction) with added ginseng and Atractylodes, and in the evening, use the modified Shenqi Wan (Kidney Qi Pills). If it shows urgency in the morning and looseness in the evening, it corresponds to yang deficiency; in the morning, use the Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction), and in the evening, use the modified Shenqi Wan. If there is urgency both morning and evening, it indicates an absence of both yin and yang, and the Ba Zhen Tang (Eight Treasures Decoction) should be used as the primary treatment.</p>
<p>For a true yang deficiency, in the morning use the Ba Wei Di Huang Wan (Eight Ingredients Rehmannia Pills), and in the evening use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonifying the Center and Benefiting Qi Decoction). If there is abdominal fullness, swelling in the limbs, cold hands and feet, difficulty in digesting food, possible diarrhea, and cold breath, this indicates true yang collapse, with spleen, lung, and kidney deficiency and coldness, unable to control the water fluids leading to overflow. One must urgently use the modified Shenqi Wan; otherwise, the condition may not be treatable. The key lies in adjusting and tonifying the earth of the spleen, often leading to improvement.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Edema</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of edema in children: the first is gaseous edema, caused by the weakness of the spleen and stomach leading to gas attacking the abdomen. Abdominal distension mistakenly prompts the use of purgatives, resulting in the upward attachment of deficient gas to the lungs. This gas then spreads to the limbs and facial features, causing swelling. The same applies to malnutrition-related gas. The second type is water edema, resulting from excessive thirst in the upper body and uncontrollable drinking. With a weak spleen and stomach unable to regulate water, the kidneys act against the spleen, causing the earth (spleen) to follow the water, which ascends to the lungs. Since the lungs govern the skin and the spleen governs the limbs, water then flows into the skin of the limbs, causing swelling. In severe cases, kidney water can infiltrate the lungs, leading to severe coughing, which is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Edema</p>
<p>The condition of edema arises when the spleen is deficient and cannot control water, leading to the kidney&#39;s water overflowing, soaking the spleen, and causing water to seep into the skin, resulting in swelling of the muscles. Facial swelling is referred to as &quot;wind,&quot; while foot swelling is called &quot;water.&quot; If pressing causes a pit to form, and lifting the hand leads to fullness, it is significant. Dark lips indicate liver damage, while a calm heart suggests heart injury. A protruding navel points to spleen issues, flat feet indicate kidney problems, and a flat back implies lung damage. If water and heat are present on the surface, sweating is indicated; if water and coolness are internal, purging is necessary. Promoting the flow of urine and harmonizing the spleen is essential. Although purging may be considered, it should not be harsh. If the stomach shows blue veins and the abdomen is full with slippery discharge, this is called &quot;gu swelling.&quot; When swelling starts in the abdomen and then spreads to the limbs, it is favorable for purging; if it begins in the limbs and then returns to the abdomen, it is difficult to treat. In men, swelling appears in the upper body, while in women, it appears in the lower body. Hard flesh and a flat palm indicate that treatment may not be possible. It is easier to treat in autumn and spring, while winter and summer are more challenging. Severe cases may last half a year, while milder cases can take three months. Treating edema is not easy, and nourishing the body is especially difficult. For swelling below the waist, promote urination; for swelling above the waist, sweating is required.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Abdominal Distension</strong></p>
<p>In children, abdominal distension can be either due to deficiency or excess. If there is difficulty in urination, accompanied by feelings of oppression and urgent panting, this is due to excess evil qi, and one should use Fenqi Drink or Taqi Pills. If urination flows freely without panting, but the face and limbs are swollen, this indicates a deficiency of righteous qi. This may be from prolonged malaria or dysentery, or from dietary harm to the spleen, causing chaotic flow of deficient qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Rongwei Decoction is used to replenish the vital energy and blood of infants who are both deficient, with the Rong and Wei systems being unbalanced. This leads to swelling in the limbs, head, face, hands, and feet, resulting in symptoms like shortness of breath, and thus it is advisable to take this medicine.</p>
<p>The ingredients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese angelica</li>
<li>Cooked and dried rehmannia (cleaned)</li>
<li>Ginseng</li>
<li>White poria</li>
<li>Sichuan lovage</li>
<li>Atractylodes</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice</li>
<li>White peony</li>
<li>Bitter orange (stir-fried separately)</li>
<li>Honey-fried astragalus</li>
<li>Aged tangerine peel</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these should be taken in equal parts (according to the measurement of your mouth), with each dose consisting of two qian (a traditional measure) in water (about a small cup), simmered down to half a cup, strained, and taken at any time without restriction.</p>
<p>The explanation states: The &quot;Rong&quot; represents blood that flows warm through the vessels, while &quot;Wei&quot; pertains to the harmonious adjustment of Qi in the channels. Therefore, Rong circulates within the vessels, and Wei functions externally. The harmony between Yin and Yang promotes uninterrupted circulation, persisting from childhood to adulthood, tied to breathing with no hindrance. When the vessels are balanced, Qi flows smoothly. If there is resistance in breathing or obstruction in the flow of Qi, it can lead to hidden issues in the organs, causing numerous ailments.</p>
<p>This formula is excellent, even suitable for young children, to strengthen their foundation, ensuring that blood, Qi, and Wei are both balanced and harmonious. It addresses coldness in the organs and weakness in vitality while promoting warmth and strength. This balance maintains natural equilibrium, offsets deficiencies, regulates weakness into strength, and creates a harmonious balance of Yin and Yang, filling the channels with Qi. Thus, what diseases could arise?<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For the treatment of children&#39;s swelling accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, restlessness in sitting or lying, swelling in the limbs, vomiting of food, and lethargy with a tendency to sleep:</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five-flavor fruit</li>
<li>Platycodon root</li>
<li>White poria</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice</li>
<li>Aged tangerine peel</li>

<li>Half summer small breed</li>
</ul>
<p>Take equal portions of the above, chew them together. For each dose, take two large money spoons with a small cup of water, add two small slices of ginger and half a date. Boil until reduced to half a cup, strain out the residue, and take it without restriction on timing, along with eight flavors of regulating middle pills.</p>
<p>It is advised: Keep the clear and turbid separate, the evil and good distinct; the upper body receives cooling while the lower body is warmed. If qi stagnates, there will be less movement up and down, and if blood is deficient, there will be excessive flow. Even if an infant breathes one breath, the pulse is gradually responsive and does not deviate from its normal count; it parallels that of adults but is merely shorter and lighter. Should there be stagnation, the pulse will be slow, leading to illness from being overly excessive or insufficient. A skilled healer will disperse stagnation, follow reversal, promote flow when stoppage occurs, reduce when there is stagnation, and ultimately harmonize the treatment, paying attention to fulfilling the qi. In general, when an infant&#39;s qi is smooth, it is easier to treat. This formula differentiates between dispersing qi and managing food and water, which discerning individuals will understand!<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child presents with chills and fever, vomiting, and refusal to eat. When the abdomen is pressed, the child cries; the pulse resembles a strand of pearls. This indicates food stagnation. First, use a large An Wan to induce vomiting and diarrhea to relieve the stagnation. However, if there are twitching of the lips and eyes, and the stool is loose and yellow, it suggests that the pathogenic factor has been expelled but is now being pressured by deficiency heat. Treat this with Liu Jun Zi Tang and add a hook of Jiaoteng for recovery.</p>
<p>A young child has abdominal distension, fever, and irritability, with a pulse that resembles a circular pearl. When the abdomen is pressed, the child cries; this indicates spleen and stomach deficiency leading to food stagnation. First, administer a dose of Bao He Wan. If symptoms recur with increased thirst and no crying when the abdomen is pressed, it signifies that the retained food has been expelled but the spleen and stomach have sustained damage. Use Wu Wei Yi Gong San with Chai Hu to treat, resulting in prompt recovery.</p>
<p>A young child frequently experiences dry vomiting, refuses milk and food, and exhibits abdominal bloating, resembling a snake; this indicates spleen and stomach deficiency leading to malnutrition. Use Si Wei Fei Er Wan to treat malnutrition, supplemented by Si Jun Zi for recuperation. Later, if food is vomited and diarrhea occurs with complete loss of appetite, and the child appears very fatigued with slight twitching in the limbs, if the pulse resembles that of a departing snake, one may decide not to use medication. The next day, vomiting ceases, but there’s still twitching and diarrhea with a bluish-yellow color, indicating spleen deficiency and liver excess. Treat with Liu Jun Zi plus Jiaoteng until cured.</p>
<p>A young child has thin limbs and abdominal enlargement, struggles to walk, and appears spider-like, yet can eat and drink but still feels thirsty and feverish, with foul stools, indicating spleen damage. Administer Shi Quan Dan multiple times for gradual recovery; also use Yi Gong San and Fei Er Wan to regulate, restoring the limbs to normal.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child was suffering from a loss of appetite and fever, and after taking a decoction of Scutellaria, Lysimachia, Sparganii, and Magnolia, the child&#39;s food intake decreased daily, with swelling in the chest and abdomen. The skin showed markings extending to the nails. I administered a modified Renowned Energy Decoction with added cloves and hook vine to warm and supplement the spleen&#39;s energy, suppress the rebellious liver wood, and after several doses, there was gradual improvement. Furthermore, I used a modified Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger to treat him, and he became stable. During this time, we frequently employed medications composed of various minerals and musk to dispel the ailment; however, there were numerous cases that turned critical and perished, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>Another child, aged eight, had an enlarged abdomen with a protruding navel, blood in the stool resembling dysentery, scant urination, a yellowish complexion, and red cheeks. This was due to food accumulation harming the spleen, combined with liver wood attacking spleen earth. When the spleen suffers, lung energy becomes deficient and cannot produce kidney water, leading to these symptoms. The first step was to eliminate the accumulation, thus I prescribed a powdered form of Jieyu Pill with added Sparganium and Artemisia three qian, mixed in light ginger soup, and taken with two teaspoons of wine, resulting in sounds from the abdomen and immediate relief of urination and defecation. Afterward, taking another two qian, the abdominal swelling decreased significantly. Next, I used two qian of Da&#39;an Pill powder, which entirely resolved the navel swelling and stopped the blood in stool. After consuming a small bowl of thin porridge, the child suddenly felt distended in the abdomen, nausea, and could not expel phlegm; this was due to spleen deficiency leading to failure in transformation resulting in phlegm accumulation. I then used two qian of the Six Gentlemen Powder, which, when mixed with ginger soup, nourished the qi, and gradually resumed food intake. However, by evening, due to heat and fatigue, there was a sensation of abdominal swelling, a consequence of the spleen deficiency affecting the yin, so I used the Renowned Energy Decoction to effect a cure. Later on, he had food injuries causing fever, abdominal bloating, and blood in the urine, and after four doses of Baohe Pill, he was cured.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from food injury, experiencing abdominal distension, vomiting, fever, and a flushed face. After taking medications to eliminate food retention and clear heat, the symptoms of digestion improved, but the fever persisted. A formula of Liu Jun Zi Tang with additions of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, each in a dose of two fen, was administered, and after four doses, the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child, inheriting kidney heat from the father, had red and painful urination. After taking a formula like Wu Ling San, he later faced food retention and took harsh purging medicines, resulting in swelling of the limbs and face, and difficulty urinating, leading to gradual respiratory distress. This was due to improper use of diuretics, resulting in spleen and lung qi deficiency, which could not retain water, causing edema. With deficiency and cold of the spleen and kidneys, he could not control water, leading to asthma. A formula of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan combined with Niu Xi, Che Qian, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang was administered, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>A young child, a few years old, often faced food retention and would take harsh medicines; later, he experienced abdominal distension, vomiting, and diarrhea. Initially, Liu Jun Zi Tang was used, which gradually alleviated the symptoms; then, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang was given to stabilize his condition.</p>
<p>One child presented with abdominal distension, and diarrhea would occur with any food intake, along with cold extremities. This indicated deficiency and cold of the spleen qi. Initially, Ren Shen Li Zhong Wan was used, followed by Liu Jun Zi Tang, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child suffering from food injury experienced abdominal distension and chest fullness with phlegm. After taking Yi Gong San, the child recovered. Upon food injury again, with abdominal distension and pain, the use of purgative medicines provided temporary pain relief but worsened the distension and increased respiratory distress. This was due to further injury to the spleen, leading to increased lung deficiency. Liu Jun Zi Tang with additions of Jie Geng for adjustment and support was used, and the child recovered.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child experienced abdominal distension, poor appetite, fever, and nausea, resembling an exterior pathogen. I said: This is due to injury from food, with weakness and heat in the spleen and lungs. I prescribed one dose of Baohuan Pill, and all symptoms quickly subsided, but the abdomen remained distended. I then used Yigong Powder for recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had food injury leading to abdominal distension, took a purging remedy, resulting in difficulty with urination; after taking a blend similar to Wuling Powder, their appetite gradually diminished, and urination became blocked, leading to sudden swelling in the limbs. I used Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan in the morning and Yigong Powder in the evening, and they recovered.</p>
<p>Another child presented with abdominal distension, a red face, phlegm wheezing, constipation, and severe heat with a preference for cold drinks. This condition was predominantly excess, so I prescribed one dose of Zishuang Pill, but all symptoms worsened, leading to a pale face despite an ongoing desire for soup. I concluded that the evil qi had retreated, yet the true qi was also harmed, hence the pale face and craving for soup. I used a large dose of Baizhu Powder to prepare broth, allowing free drinking, and after a long while, they slept well and felt stable the next day.</p>
<p>A child exhibited abdominal distension, urinated pale blue, had a mass on the left side of the abdomen, a sallow complexion, red and decayed gums, and a diminished appetite. I used Yigong Powder to adjust and tonify the middle qi as the main treatment, supplemented with Jiuwéi Luhui Wan, and applied Ferula paste externally. After two days, the mass dissipated, with slight pain on the left side. I used Sijunzi Decoction and Datuo Decoction to clear damp-heat. After a month, all symptoms slightly improved, and I continued with Yigong Powder and Ke&#39;Ma Wan until full recovery.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>
