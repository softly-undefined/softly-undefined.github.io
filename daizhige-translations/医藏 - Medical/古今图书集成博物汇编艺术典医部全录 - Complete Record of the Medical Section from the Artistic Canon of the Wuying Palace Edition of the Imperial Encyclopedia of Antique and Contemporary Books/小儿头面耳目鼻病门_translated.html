      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Collection of Medical Works from Antiquity to Present, Volume 411</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diseases of Children&#39;s Heads, Faces, Ears, Eyes, and Noses</strong></p>
<p><strong>From &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Head Sores</strong></p>
<p>It is said: For children with small sores on their heads, which are itchy and oozing yellow pus, and do not scab over, persisting for years without healing, are called &quot;jealous head sores.&quot; These should be washed with Red Dragon Skin Decoction and Tianma Decoction, taken internally with Liu Lu Decoction, and externally treated with Fei Wu Gao San and Huanglian Hu Fen Mercury Gao San.</p>
<p><strong>Children&#39;s Direct Prescriptions by Qian Yi (Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unhealed Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>Unhealed fontanelle refers to the incomplete closure of the fontanelle at birth. Such children generally tend to be more sorrowful than joyful; their sclerae are often too prominent, their faces pale and washed out, and their bodies lean, all indicative of kidney deficiency. </p>
<p>(Note: The kidneys govern marrow, and the brain is considered the sea of marrow. The aforementioned condition arises when the parents&#39; essence and blood are insufficient to nourish the child, and it is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to replenish them. If the child reaches seven or eight years old, or fourteen or fifteen years old, when Qi and blood are strong and the fontanelle naturally closes, they may be fine. However, if indulging in food and desires depletes true Yin, their lifespan cannot be fully realized. If this condition presents in infants, the mother should also be nourished, and the child&#39;s head should be tightly wrapped in soft cloth to facilitate closure. There may also be cases of recessed or filled fontanelles, both falling under insufficient constitution. Additionally, those suffering from lingering Five Taxations with depleted vital energy should also be monitored along with similar symptoms of urinary difficulty.)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Late Hair Growth</h3>
<p>If hair takes a long time to grow, and when it does, it is not black, it indicates weakness of the fetus.<br><em>Note: This is one of the five signs of late development. Hair is a manifestation of kidney vitality. This is mainly due to insufficient essence and blood from the parents, leading to weak kidney energy that cannot nourish the hair.</em></p>
<h3>Sweet Sores</h3>
<p>In children, if sweet sores do not heal for a long time, they are commonly called “fragrant sores,” mainly appearing on the face and in front of the ears. One method is to have the mother chew white rice into a paste and apply it before sleeping; it should heal in three to five applications. Both the child and mother should avoid chicken, pork, fish, rabbit, wine, vinegar, and anything that induces heat and wind. The treatment for sweet fingers follows the same method.</p>
<h3>Facial Sores</h3>
<p>Facial sores in children are referred to as eyebrow sores; ear sores are called ear sores; and foot sores are known as shoe fungi. These three terms, when examined, are all misnomers. The classics say: all painful sores are related to heart heat, resulting from severe blood heat. Some say: The “Internal Classic” states that generally, heat should not be assumed to apply to all cases. This is a misunderstanding of the way of nature; care should be taken not to be misled. A gold needle may be used to prick for blood; if it does not heal after one attempt, it should be pricked again. If it still does not heal after the second attempt, it will surely heal after the third attempt. The “Internal Classic” states: Blood that is abundant should be pricked. Eyebrow sores should not be treated with medicine, as they are often itchy; scratching may occur, and if the medicine gets into the eyes, it will cause damage.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>White Scalp</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as white scalp in children is commonly referred to as chicken dung baldness. One can use sweet melon vines and dragon head; there is no specific quantity required. Soak them in river water overnight, then boil in a clay pot to extract the extremely bitter juice. After filtering out the melon vines, use low heat to reduce it to a syrupy consistency and store it in ceramic containers. Before application, shave the head to remove all scabs and dead blood, then cleanse with river water. Afterward, take a small cup of the prepared melon vine extract, add two qian of fresh pinellia powder, one tablespoon of natural ginger juice, and one piece of dog bile together to mix. A dosage of just three qian is sufficient. It is crucial to avoid chicken, pork, fish, rabbit, and any foods that induce heat or wind.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;When heat prevails, there is swelling.&quot; To treat fire, the method involves using salty and cool medicines; emesis and purging are also effective. For acupuncture, target Shen Ting, Shang Xing, Yin Hui, Qian Ding, and Bai Hui points. Conditions like blood cloudiness can be quickly alleviated; pain can be promptly relieved; obscured vision can be restored; and swelling can be diminished. However, acupuncture should not be performed on the Yin Hui point in children, as the flesh is too thin and may damage the bones. Children’s conditions are governed by the water above and fire below, hence clear vision.</p>
<p><strong>Scabs in the Eye</strong></p>
<p>If a child&#39;s scabs enter the eye, it is due to residual heat not dissipating. The appropriate course of action is to reduce heart fire, drain liver wind, and nourish kidney water, leading to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Eye</strong></p>
<p>If a child&#39;s malnutrition-related eye condition does not improve for several days, it is caused by wind-heat from the liver. Administering Liang Ge San in several doses will aid in opening the eyes and promote healing.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<h3>Resolving Skull Issues</h3>
<p>Resolving skull issues occurs when the mother&#39;s energy is weak and there is an excess of heat. According to Dai Yun, for newborns whose skull bones have not yet fused and are open, it is advisable to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction and Four Substances Decoction, adding alcohol for heat, along with prepared cooked rhubarb, Scutellaria, roasted Coptis, and raw licorice, to be taken as a decoction. Externally, tie a silk cloth securely and apply a powder of white lanceolate.</p>
<h3>Head Sores</h3>
<p>For a child&#39;s head sores, use red charcoal to wash with flowing water, allowing the heat to cleanse it. Additionally, take a concoction of wine with Tong Sheng San (a traditional formula) while excluding the rhubarb prepared in wine, using ground coriander seeds, dragon’s liver, dragon&#39;s tail, Coptis, and white alum to mix into a paste for application.</p>
<h3>Excellent and Effective Methods</h3>
<p>Resolving skull issues relates to the fullness of maternal energy and blood, resulting in a firm and nurturing fontanelle in the child; if the mother is ill and her energy and blood are weak, the child&#39;s fontanelle will be soft and less substantial. The posterior fontanelle relates to the paternal essence; if the paternal energy is robust, the child&#39;s posterior fontanelle will be firm and nourishing. Conversely, if the father&#39;s energy is insufficient, due to excessive desire for drunkenness, the child’s posterior fontanelle will be soft and not durable, leading to a shorter life. If both parents are weak, their offspring will also have shortened lives. In such cases, the parents themselves may struggle to reach their full lifespan. The anterior fontanelle is also known as the &quot;Faith Gate&quot;; in Daoist terms, it is the &quot;Mud Ball,&quot; while the posterior fontanelle is referred to as the &quot;Brain Gate.&quot; The center of the head is also known as the &quot;Hundred Meetings.&quot; Hua Tuo provided detailed insights on facial diagnosis. The terms &quot;fontanelle&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; share the same pronunciation. When either the anterior or posterior fontanelles and the Hundred Meetings are open and weak, it is referred to as resolving skull issues.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Yellowing of Hair</strong></p>
<p>Hair is the residue of blood. When a mother&#39;s blood and qi are plentiful, the hair is black, glossy, and vibrant; if the mother&#39;s blood is deficient, leaking, and failing, with menstrual irregularities, excessive indulgence in wine and lust, or if there are issues from the womb, the child&#39;s hair becomes yellow, dry, and brittle, leading to sores and boils.</p>
<p><strong>Headache Relief</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bone marrow, the spine is the pathway of the marrow, and the brain is the sea of marrow. The liver vessels and kidney vessels flow internally through the spine and converge in the brain. Hence, conditions affecting the head and pain in the spine are illnesses caused by wind-heat of the liver and kidneys, passed from mother to child. There are two types of headache relief: one occurs shortly after birth with the skull sutures split, the scalp appearing tight and glossy; this is due to heat in the marrow. The other occurs five to six months after birth when the fontanelle closes and then reopens; children of this situation are often difficult to nurture. For illnesses of wind-heat in the kidneys and liver, it is advisable to use a modified Qingpian pill to treat it, as it is to relieve the child. The Qingpian pill should be combined with equal parts of rhubarb, scutellaria, and coptis, ground into powder, formed into honey pills, and taken. The eight ingredients for relieving headaches include heat and additional components. Bind with cotton, including cyperus and white skullcap.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>Due to irregular feeding, hunger and fullness arise, cold and heat accumulate, and the spleen&#39;s energy surges upwards. This results in swelling of the fontanel, varying in severity, and it&#39;s difficult to treat with the interplay of wind and heat. The treatment should focus on reducing heat and dispelling wind, with the use of the &quot;Xie Qing Wan&quot; for notable effects.</p>
<p><strong>Sunken Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>Prolonged diarrhea leads to deficiency of qi and blood, which cannot support the ascending vital energy. Fry dog spine and grind it into a fine powder, mix with egg white, and taking it will lead to recovery. The medicine should consist of &quot;Shen Ling Bai Zhu San,&quot; which will alleviate the sunken fontanel effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Brain Sores</strong></p>
<p>Brain sores occur shortly after birth in infants, manifesting as wounds forming crusts resembling overturned pancakes, caused by wind and heat. It is advisable to enhance the &quot;Xie Qing Wan&quot; with additional ingredients like Vitex negundo and fried burdock fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Hair Growth</strong></p>
<p>Hair is the surplus of blood and a sprout of the kidneys. If a child’s hair does not grow for a long time, and when it does, it is sparse and not black, this is due to insufficient kidney energy and blood. The &quot;Di Huang Wan&quot; is the prescribed remedy.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Secrets of Infant Care</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</p>
<p><strong>Resolving Head Issues</strong></p>
<p>A child is inherently weak and timid; if the vital energy from the fetus is insufficient, the spirit becomes lacking, resulting in excessive white in the eyes, and the skull appears unlocked, with a pale complexion. Such children are difficult to raise and often do not live beyond eighteen years. If one restrains sexual desires, they may live a little longer but still not surpass forty days. </p>
<p>There are two types of unlocked skulls: one that gradually opens after birth due to weak fetal energy and insufficient kidney strength. If it closes and then reopens, there may be cracks from the skull to the glabella, which can open slightly. If there are four cracks forming sutures, these are all indications of an unlocked skull. If the child is weak after an illness, with kidney deficiency causing water to overpower fire, the fiery essence rises, resulting in heat in the marrow; when the marrow is hot, it unlocks and the skull separates again. For those with kidney deficiency, it is advisable to take Rehmannia Pills to replenish the kidney&#39;s insufficiency, along with &quot;Tiaoyuan Decoction&quot; and &quot;Shiquandabu Decoction&quot; for both mother and child to strengthen the spleen and stomach, gradually solidifying energy and blood so that the skull naturally closes.</p>
<p>For heat in the marrow, it is recommended to take Tongsheng Powder in pill form, avoiding nitrate; external application of the sealing method on the head may also help, or using a soft cloth to tightly bind it. Covering with a cloth for an extended period can also lead to a good outcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, some children have heads that grow larger after birth, with red scalp and small eyes; this is known as &quot;brain sore.&quot; It results from the heat and toxic energy of the parents contained in the kidneys, which then rises to the brain, causing the head to enlarge and become red. Such conditions are difficult to treat and typically do not extend beyond eighteen years. If the child, before turning one, develops sores and crusts all over the head, experiencing itchiness and pain, leading to inconsolable crying day and night, this too is hard to manage. It is advisable to administer the previously mentioned &quot;苦参丸&quot; (Bitter Herb Pills) and apply &quot;松皮散&quot; (Pine Bark Powder).<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Swelling and Depression of the Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>The prescription for swelling and depression of the fontanel states: &quot;Excessive heat causes swelling, while deficient heat causes depression.&quot; Swelling at the fontanel means the bone protrudes and swells upward. The classics say: &quot;Excessive heat causes swelling, due to the evil fire rising, causing the clear and bright qi to rise without descending.&quot; There are two signs: if the swelling is firm to the touch, this means there is a cold evil on the surface, closing the pores, preventing cold and heat from escaping, which is what is meant by &quot;qi rushing up causes firmness.&quot; In this case, one should use the Rising Yang Disperse Fire Decoction; this will resolve the stagnation. If the swelling feels soft and floating upon touch, this indicates accumulated heat within, steaming upward, referred to as &quot;qi rushing up causes softness.&quot; The use of a medicinal pill made of alcohol and Xuanwu should be employed to suppress this condition. When an outbreak occurs, the illness will stop immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Scalp Sores</strong></p>
<p>For sores on the scalp, do not allow them to become ulcers due to skin breakdown, resulting in pus that does not dry, with hair stuck together and lice breeding within. Scratching due to itching will lead to chronic conditions, resulting in leprosy. First, eliminate the lice by washing with a decoction of Acorus calamus, which will kill all the lice; let it dry, then mix mercury and fine powder in a bowl, grinding them together, and adding some saliva to moisten. Use your finger to dab the medicine onto the sores and within the hair. Once the lice are removed, apply a suitable amount of smoke from the autumn cowhide mixture with rosin, ground into a fine powder, and mixed with a little light powder and realgar, then heated and applied to the affected areas. For soft sores on the scalp that do not heal over time, applying the Purple Gold Pill will be effective.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Delayed Hair Growth</strong></p>
<p>The presence of hair on the head is like the presence of grass and trees on a mountain. Hair is an excess of blood, and its abundance or scarcity depends on the richness or depletion of blood. The hexagram of Kan represents blood; blood is the essence of the kidneys, and hair is a sprout of the kidneys, which is why it is black in color. If a child&#39;s hair does not grow for a long time or is not black when it does, this indicates kidney deficiency. It is advisable to use the Rehmannia Glutinosa Pill as treatment. After a serious illness, if the hair appears in tufts or is sparse, this indicates insufficient body fluids, resulting from malnourishment. It is recommended to use the Gathered Holy Powder as treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Depressed Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>A depressed fontanelle refers to the depression of the fontanelle creating a pit. There are two signs: the classics say that a depression indicates deficient energy. After a serious illness, when body fluids are insufficient, and true energy sinks down creating a pit, one should greatly replenish original energy and use the Regulate Original Decoction with Cimicifuga. If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to a reduced appetite, and as the spleen governs the muscles, when the flesh decreases and the skin becomes thin, the fontanelle may appear protruding, which is not a true depression. In this case, one should take the Fat Baby Pill or Ginseng and Poria Powder to nourish the spleen and stomach so that appetite returns, the muscles become balanced, and the fontanelle no longer protrudes.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<h3>Concerns Regarding Head Deformities and Neck Weakness</h3>
<p><strong>Head Deformities</strong></p>
<p>After a hundred days, if the head is flattened, the &quot;Book on Nurturing Young Hearts&quot; states that the condition is more serious than a skull indentation; this is a great void, and there is virtually no chance of survival. One must not see this as a disease but rather a failure of the parents. When a newborn’s skull is not fused, one should use a soft pillow made of mung beans and adjust it frequently; do not allow the head to rest on just one side, for then the skull will surely align properly. If after this the occipital bone is still sunk in, it is due to prolonged sleeping in one position. If it becomes difficult to nurture the child and the skull shows fractures and unevenness, it is not a sign of longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Neck Weakness</strong></p>
<p>If the head is tilted backward, it indicates a weak neck. The neck is the stem of the head, also known as the Heavenly Pillar Bone. A weak neck signifies that the Heavenly Pillar Bone cannot maintain the head, causing it to tilt forward, backward, or sideways—a serious condition. The symptoms can be twofold: if a newborn has a weak neck right from birth, it results from insufficient prenatal nourishment and weak kidney energy. The kidneys regulate the bones, while the liver regulates the tendons; when tendons don’t support the bones, fractures can occur, causing the mother to deplete the child&#39;s vitality. Such a child is difficult to nurture, rarely living beyond forty years. With kidney energy being weak, it is advisable to use Rehmannia Pills with added Angelica and Dipsacus for treatment. In cases where weakness arises after a severe illness, leading to an inability to hold up the head, it is a sign of deficient blood and energy, and one should take the Totally Restorative Decoction with honey pills. The texts state: the head is the dwelling of clarity and brightness. If the head is tilted or misaligned, the spirit will depart. Generally, individuals suffering from severe illness showing this symptom are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Kānyǎn (Malnutrition-related Eye Condition)</strong></p>
<p>This condition is often due to excessive consumption of rich and spicy foods, which accumulates heat and leads to the spleen and stomach being impaired. This causes the eyes to become red and watering, the pupils to develop spots, and eventually to appear white over time, necessitating prompt treatment; otherwise, it may result in chronic disease. Initially, administer a heat-clearing drink, and then follow with Wǔgān Wán (Five Malnutrition Pills).</p>
<p><strong>Jiělú (Head Unclosed Condition)</strong></p>
<p>Zhongyang states that the condition of the head being unclosed at birth is due to insufficient kidney energy, which affects the formation of the head, leading to a tendency towards smiling less. Additionally, if the whites of the eyes are prominent and the body is thin, it indicates a disposition towards worry and little joy. I have observed this in cases of kidney deficiency. Yang states: for older infants whose cranial sutures remain open and unjoined, the kidneys govern the marrow, and the brain is considered the sea of marrow; when kidney energy is lacking, the brain and marrow are insufficient, resulting in the inability of the skull to close. A person deficient in brain marrow is like a tree without roots; generally, those with this condition will not survive long. In some cases, it takes several years to become incapacitated. If this condition is present, one should not remain passive; it is advisable to use Qiánshì Dìhuáng Wán (Qian&#39;s Rehmannia Pills) and also to prepare a fine powder of Nánxīng (Arisaema), mix it with rice vinegar, and apply it heated on scarlet silk, which is also an effective method. Applying Baiziren San (Platycladus Seed Powder) or Sanxin San (Three Aromatic Powder) is particularly excellent.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Yuan Xian and Yuan Tian</strong></p>
<p>Yuan Xian refers to the condition where the top of the head sinks. It is primarily caused by internal heat in the organs, leading to thirst and excessive drinking. This, in turn, results in diarrhea, and over time, the blood and energy become weak, unable to nourish the brain marrow. Hence, the top of the head sinks like a pit, not appearing full. To treat this, bone powder from a dog’s skull, roasted to a yellow powder, is mixed with chicken egg white and applied.</p>
<p>Yuan Tian refers to swelling or protrusion at the top of the head. The spleen governs the muscles, and irregularities in nourishment—be it overfeeding or underfeeding, hot or cold—can lead to imbalances in the internal organs. This causes energy to surge upwards, leading to swelling and protrusion of the head, which appears raised like a pile. When cold energy surges, it is hard and firm, while when hot energy surges, it is soft. If it is cold, apply warmth; if hot, apply cooling. The treatment dosage should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>For children, if liver energy is excessive, or when wind-heat attacks, the condition may similarly arise. This condition is not easily resolved. For heat symptoms, use a large Lianqiao powder to dispel it; if it’s a surface heat symptom, use Chaihu powder. There is also Fengyuan powder to cover it. </p>
<p>According to the theory, if a child’s stomach energy is balanced, the brain marrow will be full and the top of the head will gradually flatten. If the stomach is heated, it steams the internal organs, causing thirst and leading to diarrhea, which blocks heat in the organs. This weakens the blood and energy, hence the top of the head sinks. The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; recommends using Danggui powder and Dihuang pills for treatment.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Eye Conditions and Treatments</strong></p>
<p>If the eyes are red, it indicates heat in the heart; treat with &quot;Da Chi San&quot;. If they are light red, it suggests deficiency heat in the heart; use &quot;Sheng Xi San&quot;. If the eyes appear green, it indicates liver heat; treat with &quot;Xie Qing Wan&quot;. If the color is pale, it should be replenished. If yellow, it suggests spleen heat; use &quot;Xie Huang San&quot;. If there is no luster in the eyes, it indicates kidney deficiency; treat with &quot;Di Huang Wan&quot;. According to the &quot;Long Mu Lun&quot;, when young children have crossed eyes, it is often due to accidents causing injury to the head, resulting in shock to the liver, leading to the condition. For this, &quot;Niu Huang Wan&quot; is recommended. For bloodshot eyes, take &quot;Sheng Shu Di Huang San&quot;, as it promotes blood circulation. For heat toxins, use &quot;Xiao Fang Feng Tang&quot;; for wind toxins, use &quot;Xiao Liu Qi Yin&quot;; and for accumulated toxins, &quot;Xiao Ju Hua Gao&quot; is appropriate. If there are rashes affecting the eyes, &quot;Jue Ming San&quot; or &quot;Mi Meng Hua San&quot; is recommended. Additionally, &quot;Xi Jiao San&quot; or &quot;Shi Nan San&quot; can also be effective. Sometimes after vomiting or diarrhea, the eyes may appear covered, or if there are rashes affecting the eyes, causing distress, if there are various symptoms leading to a loss of luster in the eyes, it can be difficult to treat.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>Ear Disease</h3>
<p>The ear is a manifestation of the kidney. In children, when the kidney energy is abundant, the heat rises and impacts the ear, causing fluids to stagnate and transform into pus or other substances. Additionally, when water from bathing enters the ear, the humidity stays and interacts with the blood energy, brewing heat, which can also cause ear pus. If it persists without healing, it may eventually lead to deafness. Long Gu San is indicated for this condition. </p>
<p>Moreover, the Tang family has identified five types of ear discharge. The first type, &quot;yellow pus ear,&quot; usually has yellow pus discharging; the second type, &quot;red pus ear,&quot; typically has red pus; the third type, &quot;white pus ear,&quot; consistently has white pus; the fourth type, &quot;foul ear,&quot; has a stinky discharge from within; and the fifth type, &quot;hollow ear,&quot; presents with a hollow, ringing sound and sometimes discharges clear pus. However, all five conditions stem from the same source: wind and water entering the ear, leading to internal accumulation of heat. If not treated promptly, it may result in deafness. Treatments such as Yan Zhi Gao and others, along with medications to resolve phlegm and reduce heat, can result in recovery.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Illness</strong></p>
<p>For infants, on the third day, fifth day, sixth morning, or in the middle of a month, if they suddenly have nasal congestion and cannot suckle or breathe through the mouth, this often occurs when the wet nurse is asleep, and the exhalation from her nose blows onto the child. Alternatively, washing with water, whether warm or cold, without avoiding wind and cold can cause nasal congestion in the child. It is advisable to apply a nasal opening ointment and use dispersing medicine. If there are signs of fright and heat, peppermint powder can be taken, which is also good for the living.</p>
<p>There is also nosebleed, which occurs when heat attacks the qi and affects the blood. The lungs control the skin and hair of the entire body, and the mouth opens the cavities to the nose. If cold first enters the skin and then attacks the qi forming heat, this heat then affects the blood. When the blood becomes heated and behaves erratically, it releases from the nose, which is called a nosebleed. If sweating does not occur and dryness and wheezing in the nose persist, it can lead to a nosebleed. Treatment methods follow traditional formulas and adjust dosages slightly. Huangqin Decoction and Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction are the main treatments. Boiled fresh Rehmannia and reed roots are especially effective. For nosebleeds, Huangqin Decoction is the main treatment. Qingfei Drink treats the nose (covering inner pests) and cools the diaphragm.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Infant Care</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones. When kidney energy is sufficient, the brain&#39;s marrow fills, and the fontanel closes early; the bones and vessels flourish, and teeth emerge early. When kidney energy is weak, the brain&#39;s marrow is deficient, and the fontanel does not close. This occurs due to insufficient essence and blood from the parents, and it is advisable to use Rehmannia Pills for supplementation. If the child is still nursing, the mother should also supplement to harmonize and nourish the spleen and kidneys. Additionally, this condition may arise from inherent weakness in kidney energy and improper nursing, leading to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, which would also require the use of the Qi-Increasing Decoction. In cases of diarrhea with weak qi and blood, where the spleen and stomach cannot provide nourishment, the same approach applies. If the hands and feet are cold, add ginger and cinnamon to the previous decoction; if there is no response, indicating severe cold deficiency, urgently add Aconite. Delays may lead to irreparable consequences.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Ear Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the aperture of the heart and kidneys, and it corresponds to the liver and gallbladder. The heart and kidneys govern internal Essence and blood deficiency, while the liver and gallbladder are associated with external conditions of excess wind and heat. Conditions such as deafness or tinnitus are due to congenital deficiency; whereas symptoms like fullness, pain, or itch with pus are caused by pathogenic factors. For congenital insufficiency, one should use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For excess wind-heat in the liver channel, Cha Hu Qing Gan San is recommended. If due to blood dryness, Zhi Zi Qing Gan San should be used; if ineffective, it can be supplemented with Liu Wei Wan and intermittently combined with Jiu Wei Lu Huo Wan. If caused by kidney and liver heat, Liu Wei Wan should be taken in the morning, and Lu Huo Wan in the evening. For food accumulation leading to internal heat, Si Wei Fei Er Wan is indicated. If it is caused by excess heat from food consumed by a nursing mother, Jia Wei Qing Wei San should be added. If due to spleen stagnation, add Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang. If anger heat in the liver channel is the cause, Jia Wei Xiao Yao San is appropriate. All the above should be taken by the nursing mother, with a small amount given to the child. One should not focus solely on treating the external symptoms, as this can also block the ear channel, leading to other disorders, prolonged retention leading to lifelong deafness. Be cautious!<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Vision Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The scripture states: The eyes are the essence of the five organs and six bowels, constantly nourished by the spirit and soul. They are the main control of the spirit and qi. It is also said that all channels are connected to the eyes; the eyes obtain blood to see. The essence and qi from the five organs and six bowels flow upward to nourish the eyes. Therefore, the white part of the eye corresponds to the lungs, the black part to the liver, the pupil to the kidneys, the upper and lower eyelids to the spleen, the inner canthus to the heart, and the outer canthus to the bladder. Each of the five organs corresponds to a color, each having its own functions. The heart governs red; if red is excessive, it indicates heart fire, treated with a dispersing formula for red. If red is slight, it indicates heart deficiency heat, treated with a nourishing formula containing rhinoceros horn. The liver governs green; if green is excessive, it indicates liver heat, treated with a cooling formula for green. If it is pale green, it indicates liver deficiency, treated with a formula of Rehmannia. The spleen governs yellow; if yellow is excessive, it indicates spleen heat, treated with a cooling formula for yellow. If it is pale yellow, it indicates spleen deficiency, treated with a replenishing formula. If the eyes lack brightness and the white part is dark with little clarity, it indicates deficiency of both liver and kidneys, treated with a formula of Rehmannia combined with deer antler. If vision is clear by day but lost by night, it results from weakened yang qi, and in the presence of strong yin at night, the yang weakens further, resulting in inability to see, treated with a harmonizing and stomach nourishing decoction. If there are red channels with opacities moving from top to bottom, it belongs to the Foot Taiyang channel, treated with Dongyuan&#39;s selected extraordinary decoction; if moving from bottom to top, it belongs to the Foot Yangming channel, treated with a formula for regulating qi. The opacity membranes indicate internal wind-heat. If the pathogenic qi is unsettled, it is called hot opacity and floats on the surface; if the pathogenic qi is settled, it is called water opacity and sinks within; if the pathogenic qi is deep, it is called trapped opacity. It is advisable to use medicines that uplift and dispel the opacity.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If there are black and white spots appearing under the upper eyelid, it relates to cold water of the sun; if they progress from the outside inwards, it pertains to the wind and heat of the lesser yang; if they appear green from the bottom upwards, it is related to the foot yangming and diseases of the lungs and kidneys. For cataracts, this is caused by the upward surge of liver fire and damp heat, with deficiency in the spleen failing to raise clear qi, leading to white spots, inability to open the eyelids, and tears that resemble paste, which over time can produce pus and damage the eyes. One should use the Remedies to Enhance Qi and Brighten Vision, the Poria Decoction to Drain Dampness, and the Four Flavor Fattening Pills. If the eyes cannot open, it may be due to irregular intake of dairy and food, or excessive consumption of cold medicines, causing the yang qi to sink and failing to rise, hence the inability to open the eyes; this requires the Bupleurum Decoction to Restore Life. If there is deficiency in stomach qi, and the eyelashes lack strength, causing an inability to open, one should use the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Augment Qi. If there is sudden redness, swelling, and pain, this indicates an exuberance of liver fire; the Longdancao Decoction to Drain the Liver should be employed.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>For those who have watery eyes and feel shy in the light, it is due to accumulated heat in the liver and heart; use Shengxi San. There are also cases of liver and kidney deficiency heat; for these, use Dihuang Wan. If the eyes are afflicted by wind and feel rotten, it is due to accumulated heat in the diaphragm; use Qingwei San. If there is frequent itching, it indicates the presence of pus and maggots; apply Zisu Gao. If the eyelashes are entangled, it is due to wind-heat in the liver channel; use Chaihu Qinggan San. If there is yellowing of the lower eyes accompanied by strong fever, constipation, lack of appetite, flushed face, and closed eyes, this is caused by the mother’s heat and toxins during pregnancy; the child should take Xiehuang San and the mother Dihuang Wan. If the breastfeeding mother has accumulated heat causing the child’s yellowing eyes, the mother should take Qingwei San. If the limbs, face, and nails are all yellow, and the urine is the color of house dust, it is difficult to treat. Additionally, if there are residual toxins from measles affecting the eyes, it indicates kidney and liver deficiency; use Ziyin Shenqi Wan. For the aforementioned conditions, it is advisable to carefully treat the mother while also adjusting the child’s treatment.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Nasal Congestion and Nosebleed</p>
<p>The Physician Chao stated: The nose is the opening of the lungs, and the skin and pores are primarily linked to the lungs. When wind pathogens invade the lungs, causing nasal congestion and obstruction, one should use Xiaofeng San (Wind-dispelling Powder) or take seven green onion stalks, mix them with a small amount of oily powder, pound them, and then apply to the Yinzhen (the area between the eyebrows) while keeping it warm in the palm. If there is a nosebleed due to panic causing the qi to scatter and the blood to lose its restraint, one should use Yigong San (Special Efficacy Powder) combined with Chaihu (Bupleurum) and Shan Zhi Zi (Gardenia fruit). If the left side of the face is both blue and red, one should first use Chaihu Qinggan San (Bupleurum Liver-clearing Powder) and then take Dihuang Wan (Rehmannia Pill). If the right side of the face is red, it indicates heat in the lungs and large intestine, so one should use Xiebai San (White-draining Powder). If the nose is red, it indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, which requires Xiehuang San (Yellow-draining Powder). If slightly red, it indicates deficiency heat in the spleen channel, necessitating Yigong San with additional Shengma (Cimicifuga) and Chaihu. If the color is deep yellow, use Jisheng Xiang Di Huang Tang (Life-sustaining Rehmannia Decoction) followed by Yang&#39;s Dihuang Wan. If pale white, use Liu Junzi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction). If there is redness between the chin, use Siwu Tang (Four Substance Decoction) with Shan Zhi Zi; if severe redness, apply Wuma San (Five-Sesame Powder). If the urine is reddish, use Liuwei Wan (Six-Flavor Pill) or Buzhong Yiqi Tang (Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction). If the lips are white, use Liu Junzi Tang; if it hasn’t healed for a long time, use Maimendong Yin (Ophiopogon Decoction). </p>
<p>If the illness is recent and the original qi is not depleted, with normal intake of food, fever, strong heat, constipation, thirst for water, and sleeping with open eyes, this indicates that both the form and sickness are solid and treatment should focus on expelling the pathogen. If the illness has lasted a long time and the original qi is depleted, with reduced appetite, fever, dry mouth, drinking soup, vomiting, diarrhea, cold sensitivity in the limbs, and sleeping with open eyes, this indicates that both the form and sickness are deficient and the main focus should be on replenishing the righteous qi.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Sutra on the Fontanel&quot; states: If the fontanel has not closed, the sinews and bones will be soft and weak. If the fontanel shows blue veins, it signifies a weak and un-nourished pulse. If the fontanel is constantly sunken, it leads to frequent diarrhea. If the fontanel is protruding, wind diseases will not cease. If the fontanel remains cold for a long time, it causes clear vomiting and diarrhea. If the fontanel is soft and slack, seizures from dizziness are unavoidable. If the fontanel is flat and depressed, diarrhea may easily occur. If the fontanel is elongated, it predisposes to death from wind. If the fontanel connects with the forehead, it is easy to be startled into convulsions. If the fontanel is incomplete, there will be fear of heat and aversion to cold. If the fontanel closes slowly, the prenatal energy may be inadequate. If the fontanel has frequent movements, it indicates confusion of the spirit and weakness of energy. If the fontanel is wide, it leads to numerous illnesses and suffering. The fontanel is the gateway of the spirit and the key to the pathways of the body. It connects the upper and lower regions and links all important points. The seven orifices should be open, as are those of the five organs. The palace of the mud ball is the cavity of the soul and spirit. When energy is strong, it is closed; when energy is weak, it is open. This is due to growth; closure cannot be neglected. Physicians, upon examination, should discern the situation and decide on treatment. Medications must be employed cautiously. If the fontanel is wide and the illness is severe, the fear is that treatment may be difficult, necessitating caution.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Principles [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case of Scalp Deformity</strong></p>
<p>When paternal essence is insufficient, there will be a deformity of the scalp, and the whites of the eyes will be prominent. A scalp deformity suggests the absence of brain marrow, like a tree without roots. Though the ancients had good remedies, they would prove ineffective after much effort. However, one should not wait idly; it is advisable to rely on the Qian family&#39;s kidney-tonifying methods, in case there is any principle by which life can be sustained. The Qian family&#39;s Ginseng and Rehmannia Pill combined with deer antler is an example. Zeng says: Those who exhibit these signs, within a thousand days, may sometimes endure for a few years. An illness could suddenly worsen, resulting in severe disability. If the complexion is clear and the person can consume food, taking items like the Regulating Yuan Powder or Reinforcing Kidney Rehmannia Pills will show significant effects within ten days. Adjusting the treatment gradually may yield a cure. If treatment yields no change, healing will be difficult.</p>
<p>Tian states: For scalp deformity treatment, it is advisable to use Fresh Rehmannia Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Case of Sunken Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>Zeng states: A sunken fontanel represents extreme deficiency. When the stomach&#39;s energy is deficient and cold, it leads to this condition, which may be associated with chronic fright. If one experiences stomach cold combined with spleen burden, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, this indicates extreme deficiency. One should promptly utilize Golden Elixir Pill, Gu Zhen Decoction, and other reviving medicines, externally applying black adhesive plaster. For those with sinking at the back of the head, the symptoms are particularly severe. The treatment methods are the same as those for a sunken fontanel. If there is no effectiveness, healing will be difficult. This indicates extreme deficiency, with almost no possibility of survival.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Herniation</strong></p>
<p>The evidence of herniation can arise from an accumulation under the child&#39;s ribs, causing cough and crying, with the breath rising in reverse; if the crying persists for a long time and the breath has not settled, it is due to nursing; conditions of excess liver qi and ascent of wind-heat can also cause herniation. One must investigate each cause and treat accordingly. For those with cold, warm them; for those with heat, cool them. For reversed breath, harmonize and bring it down; for excess liver qi, use draining techniques primarily. In cases of heat, the formula Da Lian Qiao Tang is often used, while for exterior conditions, Xiao Feng San is recommended; for deficient cases, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang followed by Di Huang Wan. One must understand and clarify, as it resides within each person, and words cannot fully express intent. </p>
<p>The Zeng family states: people in the world often think of swelling as solely a heat issue, but little do they know, there are both yin and yang conditions that should be carefully distinguished. Hardness signifies yin while redness and softness signify yang, hence the &quot;Children&#39;s Treasure Book&quot; states: if cold qi ascends, it becomes firm; if heat qi ascends, it becomes soft. This is precisely what is meant. For yin conditions, manage with Yun Qi San or Li Zhong Tang; for yang conditions, use Yu Lu Yin, Dang Gui San, or Fang Feng Tang for treatment. </p>
<p>The &quot;Shi Bi Jing&quot; verse states: &quot;Accumulated heat in the spleen not flowing leads to a red face and lips. Chest tightness and nighttime coughing bring about filling and swelling; do not allow it to spread, provoking wind in the lungs.&quot;<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>When sounds are made in the throat and phlegm accumulates, the fontanel swells and heat rises. If only the cooling of the diaphragm can soothe the spirit, it will lead to quick results. Both heat and cold can cause swelling. Cold leads to white stools or a sour, foul smell that assaults the senses, sometimes with worms emerging, as food cannot be digested, resulting in abdominal bloating and discomfort, with rumbling in the throat. Heat causes excessive thirst, results in red stools, presents with a yellowish complexion, bad breath, and also leads to worms emerging. Each condition should be treated according to its symptoms, while also requiring the removal of accumulated food and the regulation of qi. Cold indicates the need to warm the spleen and stomach, while heat needs to be dealt with to transform phlegm and stop thirst. When the fontanel is sunken, it indicates cold; when swollen, it indicates heat. Accumulated heat and a poorly-formed sunken fontanel suggest that the thirty-six types of damp-clearing powder should be used, along with a concentrated decoction of mulberry bark. </p>
<p>The &quot;Theory of Physical Symptoms&quot; states: Lung heat causes wind-phlegm and fontanel swelling; administering a dose of white cloves syrup or a few doses of nandina pills will alleviate the condition. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essential Guide to Strategies&quot; suggests: Whenever infants show swelling in the fontanel within the first month after birth, this is due to the heat energy received during gestation. Apply Huangbo ointment to the Yongquan acupoint on the soles of their feet. If it is sunken, use Banxia ointment on the palms. This indicates that the infant&#39;s kidneys are affected by cold qi, disrupting the heart and resulting in illness. Both Huangbo and Banxia are in powdered form, to be mixed with cold water for application.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>The Inversion of the Celestial Pillar</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wang states: The child has long suffered from malnutrition, being weak in body and not consuming food and drink for an extended period. As the condition worsens, the symptoms recede, leading to the inversion of the celestial pillar bone. The physicians do not recognize this and label it as the five soft conditions. One must administer Jinling San and Shengjin San. </p>
<p>Song from &quot;Treatise on Symptoms&quot;: The celestial pillar being inverted is difficult to treat, as this illness is neither of the heart nor the spleen. If one is afflicted, one must first consider vomiting or diarrhea; otherwise, the vital energy becomes depleted. Significant concerns arise with cold damage and the absence of a pulse; as mentioned in the &quot;Feng Sui Jing&quot;: one is then affected by cold damage with no floating pulse. </p>
<p>Appropriate medicine must be used to treat this condition; without a sudden onset of this ailment, one also cannot discern the nuances of the limbs being robust. If the body feels weak and the head is heavy, the face is flushed, lips reddened, the disease often arises from kidney heat, which later leads to residual heat illnesses. </p>
<p>The two verses in the &quot;Feng Sui Jing&quot; say: This ailment should only arise from gallbladder heat, and later latent heat will follow. The liver endures the heat and wind as the celestial pillar inverts, hence cool herbs must be administered to stabilize the condition. </p>
<p>It is essential to use warm medicinal herbs to alleviate it; immediate relief will be seen, so do not doubt. With vomiting or diarrhea, one must only regulate the vital energy; in cases of cold damage with the pillar inversion, no medical treatment is necessary. </p>
<p>This may relate to cold damage or be due to vomiting or diarrhea; the evil toxins penetrate the liver&#39;s channel, and the hot evil invades, resulting in weakened sinews. This may cause hands and feet to soften and remain unraised, or the neck and shoulders to weaken, impeding movement. If previous symptoms are present, one must cool the diaphragm; if vomiting or diarrhea occurs, first regulate the stomach&#39;s energy, apply cool medicines for the liver and gallbladder. One must not use excessively hot treatments, as one may also fear excessive cold.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Scalp Sores</strong></p>
<p>Scalp sores in children are caused by the six yang energies being afflicted by toxins and heat, leading to sores on the head. If sores spread in patches on the scalp, often accompanied by dryness, itchiness, and sparse hair resembling white flakes, this is due to accumulated heat attacking upwards, known as &quot;bald sores.&quot; Although the sores appear on the head, people generally only know to apply external medicine for treatment, and even if cured within ten days or a month, the sores often recur. Why is that? It is because the head is the convergence point for all yang energies. According to the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; in the Five Elements theory, fire is said to rise up. Heat and toxins attacking upwards and the two yang energies scorching each other result in sores on the head. The treatment should focus on alleviating the accumulated heat and calming the heart&#39;s agitation. For chronic scalp sores in children, a remedy using the Feng Tong Sheng San mixed with wine can be employed, along with separately ground Da Huang to a fine powder. This should then be mixed with wine and dried to become a powder. Each dose should be one qian, boiled in water for consumption, taken four to five times a day. Improvement can be seen after around thirty applications.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Hair being Late and Yellow</strong></p>
<p>The Chao clan said: The Foot Shaoyin is the channel of the kidney, and its manifestation is in the hair. If a child is born with insufficient Shaoyin blood and qi, their hair will be sparse, thin, and fail to grow. There are also cases where hair falls out due to scalp sores. This all arises from damage to the blood; when blood and qi are deficient, they cannot nourish the hair, leading to its yellowing.</p>
<p><strong>Red, Swollen, and Painful Eyes</strong></p>
<p>The Zeng clan said: Extreme heat combined with wind leads to red, swollen, and painful eyes, which stay shut day and night, causing constant crying without cessation. First, use the Jiu Xian powder, decocted with water, ginger, and scallions, for internal consumption; then use the San Jie powder mixed with warm rice wash for oral administration, and apply Huanglian ointment. </p>
<p>If there are symptoms caused by seasonal variations, with sudden redness and swelling of the eyes, and severe pain ongoing day and night, leading to confusion if prolonged: First, use Jiu Xian powder to resolve the exterior; then use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus Ban Xia, with the addition of Da Huang, Bohe, Zhu Ye, and Sheng Di Huang, decocted for consumption; also administer Cao Long Dan powder and apply Huanglian ointment, along with cooling plasters.</p>
<p>For children with a naturally weak stomach and strong spleen qi, presenting with red, swollen eyelids and an inability to open their eyes, using harsh cold medications to reduce redness and swelling can harm the spleen and stomach, causing vomiting if not diarrhea, or slightly cold extremities. Furthermore, if warm medications are used to treat them, the eye condition may worsen.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>First, use (Koufu) Five Ling Powder, steeped in water with ginger and lantern heart, and take it.

<p>In my life, I have never had issues of red eyes, and I have used this remedy successfully. It can be used for both adults and children. For initial cases of red and watery eyes, simply use your own urine, open your eyes to let it flow out while pressing with a finger on the eyes, then close your eyes for a moment, and it will be effective. This works by using true energy to expel the evil heat.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>External Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>For children suffering from eye ailments, do not lightly use eye drops; the primary focus should be on internal medication to dispel the disease. Examine the red veins above and below, and treat according to the meridian.</p>
<p><strong>Variola Entering the Eye</strong></p>
<p>The poison of variola arises from the five viscera and six bowels, and when the poison is strong, the eyes are inevitably affected. The ancient teachings regarding eye protection are profound. If the sores are excessively out and the eyes weep constantly, this signifies liver heat. At this time, there are no visible sores in the eyes, but one should internally take medicine to purge liver fire. The variola in the eye often occurs after the facial rash is uneven. If sores enter the eye and form a cataract, do not use eye drops, as this could damage the eyes irreparably. After the variola subsides, if the eyes cannot be opened, this indicates liver heat leading to sensitivity to light; whether in bright or dim conditions, they may struggle to open. If the heart&#39;s heat encounters brightness, the eyes may close; if in darkness, they may open, creating what is known as photophobia, indicating residual heat in the heart and liver. </p>
<p>If the sore has not yet formed pus and the swelling recedes allowing the eyes to open, this indicates the sore has passed its critical period. Uneven skin recovery causing the eyes to remain closed indicates the sore is deteriorating. If the eyes jerk upwards, this signifies heart failure; if they fixate without movement, this indicates kidney failure; if tears flow without crying, this suggests liver failure; slight closure indicates energy depletion; blood in the pupils indicates fire overwhelming water, all of which are fatal signs. </p>
<p>For those weakened by the variola poison in the eyes, cooling agents are not advisable; one should wait until after the facial rash to treat.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Although there may be vision obstruction, do not apply eye drops. It is better to invigorate the blood and resolve toxins, waiting for the five organs to restore harmony, at which point the obstruction will naturally dissipate. If mistakenly using drops, it will not only be ineffective but may cause further harm. </p>
<p>Dan Xi says: If smallpox injures the eyes, one must use gardenia, red peony, cassia seed, angelica root, forsythia, siler, platycodon, and bulbus, in small doses as powder, taken as medicine. If the eyes lack brightness, after more than a hundred days when the blood and qi are restored, clarity will naturally return.</p>
<p>Zhang Bing states: To treat the toxic qi attacking the eyes after a rash, or if there is a membrane of red or black, one should use Si Wu Decoction with schizonepeta and siler, decocting and taking it; also use black bean skins, plantain, sea clam, and licorice divided into powder, combining with slices of cooked pig liver dipped in, which is remarkably effective. </p>
<p>A formula for treating vision obstruction caused by smallpox utilizes Jiangxi clam powder, black bean skin, licorice, and honey chrysanthemum, mixed as powder and taken as medicine. </p>
<p>Dan Xi states: For vision obstruction occurring after smallpox, repeatedly taking Wei Ling Xian and Xian Ling Pi, cleaned and ground finely, without exposure to fire or sun, is recommended, taken whenever needed. </p>
<p>Qian’s Huangbo ointment is to be applied to the face to protect the eyes when smallpox first erupts; the Jiaogan San is used to treat excessive rashes and should not enter the eyes.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Residual Toxicity from Smallpox</p>
<p>Smallpox is the most severe of poisons, due to the accumulation of malevolent toxins since birth. In ancient times, it was called the &quot;Hundred-Year Sore,&quot; as it is something that no one can avoid throughout their century of life. Once it manifests, the pure and harmonious vital energy of the body&#39;s channels and meridians is disturbed, resulting in a significant depletion of the righteous qi, allowing evil influences to take hold, each manifesting as various diseases based on what has been transgressed. Moreover, the eye, which is the clearest and most pure, is connected to the liver and gallbladder. The liver and gallbladder are the repositories of purity, where good and evil cannot coexist. When one&#39;s body is exposed to impure evils, it leads to a loss of the source of nourishment for the eyes, making them susceptible to illness; this happens because individuals are unable to rescue themselves and instead inflict harm upon themselves.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Some illnesses arise from excessive consumption of food when one is unwell, retaining too much warmth, mistakenly taking hot medications, or consuming too much sweet and sour food, leading to illness. Others may become ill after recovery from an ailment, due to deficiency, overeating spicy, dry, fatty foods, overexerting oneself with excessive visual strain or crying, and exposing oneself to wind, dust, smoke, and miasmas. There may be cases of internal symptoms causing blurred vision and tearing or external symptoms like red, inflamed star-like obstructions. Some may have residual pathogenic factors that lead to conditions like fat and yellow membranes, or corneal opacities, which can result in protruding eyes. Others may have milder saline manifestations like red threads or slight haziness that resolve on their own. The severity and nature of these conditions vary from person to person and should be treated based on the specific symptoms, as blindly adhering to one approach may cause adverse reactions. </p>
<p>After experiencing smallpox, a person may feel reborn, yet different from usual. If any discomfort persists, it could cause lifelong harm. Therefore, those in this field should exercise caution. Generally, treating conditions early makes recovery easier with fewer complications; if delayed, even if there are no significant changes, blood and energy may congeal, making even straightforward cases harder to remedy. People today often assume that visual disorders following smallpox cannot be treated. However, if the pupil and gaze are not affected, there may still be a chance for recovery, even after a long time. It’s only when blood has solidified and symptoms of obstruction have developed that treatment becomes infeasible. </p>
<p>Ni Zhongxian states that residual toxin from rashes is somewhat similar to illnesses from unregulated wind and heat, and should be primarily treated with antler horn powder. For less severe cases, reduce the use of nitrate and yellowrye. If the illness appears within twenty days, one should apply detoxifying and rash-resolving decoctions.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Eye Worm</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Dragon Wood Treatise&quot;: To treat the outward obstruction of children&#39;s eye worms, this condition initially arises from sores in the head and mind, or from prolonged diarrhea, which can cause hidden swelling and pain, resulting in tears that are difficult to open. Heat energy accumulates in the diaphragm, and liver wind enters the eyes. When first affected by this condition, there is itching, rubbing the eyebrows, and biting the nails, leading to the formation of opacity, redness, swelling, pain, and tears that fail to open. The eyelids become hard and the white part of the eye is covered, causing sensitivity to light; they prefer to lie down with their face covered and dislike raising their heads. This ailment is not suitable for cauterization on the head and face, fearing damage to the eyes. Avoid applying ointments. It is advisable to take medication for dispelling the worms and for resolving opacity.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Sacred Benefits Treatise&quot;: The liver opens at the eyes, and the eyes are indicators of liver health. If children have internal worm energy, their bodies become thin and weak, and due to wind and heat engulfing the organs, the flow is obstructed and cannot circulate. This is often due to excessive milk and food intake, which creates phlegm obstruction in the chest. The evil heat rises to attack the eyes, causing brain heat and itchy eyes, leading to redness, ulceration, or opacities gradually covering the vision. If left untreated for long, it damages the eyes, hence being called eye worms.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Jade Formula,&quot; it is stated: For this condition, first cool and regulate the diaphragm, then address the liver, followed by cleansing; this approach is effective. It also indicates: This condition is due to liver heat in children, and it is necessary to use liver cleansing powder and apricot kernel ointment to cool the diaphragm and reduce heat. Additionally, for children&#39;s eye worms, if there are spots and sores entering the eyes, first administer remedies to alleviate the diaphragm&#39;s heat and cool the heart, followed by worm treatment.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Disease</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan said: In children, lung qi connects to the nose, and qi represents the yang. If this qi is harmed by wind-cold, it stagnates in the nose, leading to nasal congestion; cold qi prevents the fluids from being retained, resulting in excessive nasal discharge. If cold air lingers, purulent discharge accumulates, causing an inability to smell, which leads to a condition known as &quot;malodorous nose.&quot; If there is accompanying heat, the nose becomes dry. All these conditions impede the digestion of milk and food.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Yan Shan said: If a child has nasal congestion, it is advisable to apply Tongguan ointment and take dispersing medicine. The Tongguan ointment is made from white silkworms, pig&#39;s tooth soap, schizonepeta, cyperus, chuanxiong, and asarum, ground into powder, mixed with the white part of scallions, and applied to the forehead for efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states: Lung qi connects to the nose; if the internal organs are harmed by wind-cold, the cold follows the qi into the nose, preventing the retention of fluids, resulting in nasal discharge. Fluids like saliva and mucus, when exposed to heat, become dry; when exposed to cold, they overflow.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Nose with No Discharge</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states: When a child’s lungs are obstructed, with accumulated heat attacking upward towards the brain, it causes heat in the brain. Since lung qi connects to the nose and is responsible for mucus, if the organs are hot, the fluids become dry, leading to a lack of discharge.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p>
<h3>Nasal Polyps</h3>
<p>The &quot;Qianjin Yi&quot; states: People often have flesh obstructing their noses, which affects their sleeping and eating. There are many folk remedies for nasal discharge, yet they are all ineffective. Only &quot;Bencao&quot; mentions that realgar is for nasal polyps, which is true. However, contemporaries do not know how to use realgar; when practitioners use it incorrectly, it leads to complications. There was once a person who could not breathe through the nose, and I processed realgar, approximately the size of a large jujube, and after ten days, the obstruction resolved, allowing for breathing to resume without recurrence. The method of processing realgar is mentioned in the &quot;Qianjin Yi&quot; in the elixir formulas, and it should be sought after.</p>
<h3>Hearing Loss</h3>
<p>Zhang Huan says: In children, ear diseases arise when wind enters the brain and stagnates in the hand&#39;s Taiyang meridian, causing hearing loss. When wind and dampness clash, sores appear in both ears. When a child grows a little older and sees the new moon and points at it, sores may appear beneath the ears, known as moon eclipse sores. When a wet nurse bathes a child and mistakenly allows water to enter the ears, the moisture accumulates, clashing with the blood and qi, forming pus, which is called otorrhea. The &quot;Baojian&quot; rhyme goes: &quot;When wind enters the ear, hearing is damaged; when qi is stagnant, hearing loss is certain. Ringing indicates that wind and qi clash, and pain suggests that there is evil wind in the brain. Heat in the kidneys steams and causes hearing issues; the pain deepens, producing thick pus. If there is no thick pus, it is not this illness, but rather due to water dripping inside.&quot;<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Deafness</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: The hand of the solar meridian enters the ear; when wind enters the head, it travels along the channels, colliding with the qi, which causes deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Tinnitus</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: The evil qi collides with the right qi, resulting in tinnitus; if this persists, the evil qi becomes stagnant and eventually leads to deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Otitis</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: The ear is where the ancestral meridian converges and where the kidney qi flows. In children, if the kidneys are abundant and possess heat, this heat qi rushes upwards to the ear, causing fluids to become stagnated, leading to the production of pus. Also, if water enters the ear during bathing and is not thoroughly drained, the moisture may accumulate, interfere with the blood qi, and generate heat, resulting in pus as well. This condition is referred to as otitis. If it endures and does not heal, it may turn into deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> (Ming, Li Zhan)</p>
<p><strong>Cranial Relief</strong></p>
<p>Cranial relief is primarily due to deficiency in the kidney system. In older children, if the head seams remain open and do not close properly, it is advisable to use kidney qi pills, or the Eight Treasure Formula combined with wine, cooked with rhizome and lotus. Externally, powdered nanshing and white lance can be mixed with vinegar, spread on red silk, heated, and applied. Alternatively, burning tiger skull bones into ash and mixing with oil can be applied to the seams, with a head covering for protection. Parents should take kidney qi pills and tiger tranquilizing pills to ensure sufficient essence and blood, preventing such issues in future offspring.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Head Swelling and Depression</strong></p>
<p>Wind-heat leads to head swelling and spleen deficiency. Head swelling occurs when liver qi is strong and wind-heat surges upward to create this condition. The &quot;Yuhuan Collection&quot; states: when the head gate swells, it is certainly due to wind, and this condition should be treated but is not serious. If it develops into a pit-like form, within seven days, life is surely at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Principles: Six Essentials</strong>  [Ming Dynasty, Zhang Sanxi]</p>
<p><strong>Post-Lesion Opacity Obscuring Vision</strong></p>
<p>Hai Zang asserts: Dongyuan treats remaining wind-heat poison after spots, where the membrane blocks vision, using Qingshan Pills for great effect. &quot;Baoming Collection&quot; states: for removing the membrane, it is effective to not only reduce with Da Huang but also to treat the root cause. I believe that prolonged retention of wind-heat in the liver channel leads to the formation of the membrane, and Qingshan Pills are indeed used to address the root of the disease. For children whose rash aftermath leads to upward attack on the eyes, causing membrane swelling and pain, with a strong pulse and good appetite, use a modified version of the antelope horn powder to resolve it. For those with qi and blood deficiency and weak stomachs, it is essential to prioritize nourishment, supplemented with detoxification, to achieve success. Danxi stated: Xijiao powder disperses upward, more so than other horns, and is used for those with residual poison post-pox. If there is no residual poison, it leads to risks of weakness, which should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Sparrow&#39;s Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>For young children, the condition of the fontanelle relates to the liver and spleen channels. If the spleen is weak, strengthen the spleen; if the liver is deficient, nourish the blood. These should be treated in two ways. The child’s diet and complexion may appear normal, but they cannot see at night, thus it is advisable to use restorative drinks.</p>
<p><strong>Cranial Relief</strong></p>
<p>In children, strong kidney energy results in the fontanelle being small and closed early; whereas weak kidney energy leads to an open fontanelle. If the fontanelle does not heal, the illness may attack repeatedly, making it extremely difficult to protect the child, which is a serious condition.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Swollen and Sunken Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>All newborns have a fontanelle, as their internal energy is not yet full, their bone marrow is not complete, and nourishment is insufficient. Internal organs rely on the spleen and stomach for nourishment. After birth, when the child is fed with grains, their internal energy is replenished and bone marrow matures, leading to the closing of the fontanelle once they can eat. The fontanelle is connected to the spleen and stomach. The &quot;Seng Ji Jing&quot; states that the fontanelle is connected to earth, which corresponds to the spleen and stomach. If a child has a swollen fontanelle, it is due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, imbalance of hot and cold, angry crying when fed, or wheezing and coughing, leading to a reversal of Yin and Yang energy that causes the fontanelle to swell. It swells and feels soft with heat, and swells and feels hard with cold. A sunken fontanelle may result from diarrhea, frequent urination, past intake of cleansing medicines, inherent weak energy, or lingering other illnesses, all of which render the internal organs deficient and unable to nourish the fontanelle, hence causing it to sink. These are all severe conditions for children, and few manage to recover.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>On Various Head Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Soft boils that appear on a child&#39;s head are caused by the invasion of wind and cold, affecting the skin, lingering in the blood and qi, obstructing the meridians, and accumulating to form these boils, similar to those that arise on the body but located on the head. Initially, they appear red and swollen and hard; if the pathogen is mild, it may dissipate on its own. However, if the pathogen is severe, the swelling becomes red and painful, producing pus and blood. Due to the tightness of the scalp, it is often difficult to fully remove the pus when it becomes mature; there may be residual foul fluid that leads to recurrence or the emergence of new boils at the edges, resulting in continuous non-healing, often painfully abscessing, hence the name soft boils. </p>
<p>For children with bald patches on the head, according to the Nine Worms theory: this is caused by pinworms interacting with wind pathogens, affecting the skin of the head, colliding with the blood and qi, and injuring the nourishing and protective aspects. The nourishing aspect relates to blood; when diseased, it leads to red baldness; the protective aspect relates to qi; when diseased, it causes white baldness. As the nourishing aspect is internal, it is more difficult for pathogens to affect it, hence cases of red baldness are rare; meanwhile, as the protective aspect is external, pathogens can easily invade, leading to more cases of white baldness.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>At first, it appears like spots of scabs, with flakes of skin on top. Gradually, it forms crusts, leading to wounds that ultimately result in nearly complete hair loss. If the crusts are scraped off, the wounds are filled with holes of varying sizes. There is pus that oozes out, and while there is no pain, there is an unbearable itch, indicating the presence of a &quot;wind&quot; insect. There is also a condition commonly called &quot;ghost licking the head,&quot; where a child with a scalp sore is said to be licked by a ghost overnight, resulting in red crusts covering the head, sometimes referred to as &quot;red baldness.&quot;</p>
<p>The cause of a child&#39;s scalp sore is internal heat affecting the organs, which then rises to the head. Coupled with external wind and moisture, these factors combine, impacting the blood and qi, thereby leading to the sores, hence it is called scalp sores. This condition is distinct from bald sores. Bald sores can appear both white and red, with hard crusts covering the entire head. In contrast, scalp sores might only appear in one or two spots, lacking the whitish, hard, dry texture, often exuding pus and blood. Commonly referred to as &quot;long scalp sores,&quot; these are known to occur when children fail to wash their hair properly.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>About Hair</strong></p>
<p>Those with a vigorous heart and spirit have clear forms and abundant hair; those with a timid heart have little to no hair growth, and if it does grow, it lacks color. The heart governs the blood, and hair is considered the surplus of blood; thus, timidity leads to prolonged absence of growth.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Diseases of the Ear</strong></p>
<p>When a child suddenly suffers from deafness or diminished hearing, it is due to the invasion of wind pathogens affecting the Hand Taiyang channel. The pathogen follows this channel and enters the ear; when the pathogen clashes with the correct energy, it causes stagnation and blockage, resulting in deafness and inability to hear sounds. In mild cases, it may result in diminished hearing, where the ear feels heavy, making it hard to distinguish faint sounds, while louder noises can still be heard.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Ear Noises and Pain</strong></p>
<p>If a child experiences ringing or pain in the ears, it is due to the invasion of wind evil into the ears, which interferes with vital energy. If it collides with blood and qi, it results in ringing; if it affects the meridians, it leads to pain.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Swelling and Pus</strong></p>
<p>If a child has swelling or sores in the ears producing pus, it results from a combination of wind and dampness entering the ears, affecting the opposition between evil and vital energy, colliding with qi and blood, and damaging the meridians. If mild, it causes swelling; if severe, sores may develop. If bodily fluids accumulate and break down, pus and blood may emerge. Additionally, if water or tears enter the ears, obstructing vital energy, this too can lead to pus, commonly referred to as &quot;tinnitus&quot; or &quot;purulent ear.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eye Diseases Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When a child has eye diseases, it is often due to excessive consumption of sweet and sour foods, generating internal heat and affecting the liver meridian, which manifests in the eyes. This may lead to redness, swelling, itching, or pain; excessive tearing; the presence of red veins; or the formation of membranes. If phlegm, dampness, and toxic qi invade the liver, causing its energy to become obstructed, then clarity is not achieved; hence, even if the pupils are intact, vision may be impaired, a condition termed &quot;dimming vision.&quot; If one cannot see during the day, it is considered an evil affecting the yin of the meridians, known as &quot;night blindness,&quot; akin to a bird that cannot see in the dark. Additionally, there can be eye obstructions caused by toxic qi covering the eyes, or liver heat impacting the eyes, which can also lead to membrane formation as a barrier.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Nasal Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The lung qi communicates with the nose. If the qi is not harmonized, it can be invaded by wind and cold, becoming stagnant in the nose, obstructing the fluids and causing mucus to congeal, resulting in blocked nasal passages, which is termed nasal obstruction. If wind and cold obstruct the blood qi, causing the formation of flesh-like obstructions, it is called nasal polyp. If wind and dampness interact, sores and purulent discharge may develop in the nose. If heat from the brain attacks the nose leading to dryness, or if sores and scabs form, they may be hard and devoid of purulent discharge.<br>— From the &quot;Young and Young Near Compilation&quot; by Chen Zhi (Ming Dynasty) </p>
<p><strong>Nasal Collapse</strong></p>
<p>Nasal collapse occurs due to deficiency of kidney qi, leading to insufficient brain marrow, with damp heat ascending, causing the cranial sutures to separate and not align. It is advisable to use Di Huang Wan with deer antler and fried Baizhu. For those with qi deficiency and heat, the Four Gentlemen Decoction with fried Baizhu is recommended. The &quot;Expanded Meaning&quot; suggests treating nasal collapse with crab claws mixed with Rhizoma Bletillae, ground into a paste and applied to the crown.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Depression</strong></p>
<p>Nasal depression occurs when qi and blood are both deficient and the original qi sinks. It is suitable to use the Middle-Qi Boosting Decoction; if the hands and feet are cold, add ginger, cassia, and even prepared aconite.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Filling</strong></p>
<p>Nasal filling occurs due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach leading to a reversal of qi that ascends. There may also be spleen-stomach heat or damp heat present. In these cases, it is advisable to use Yigong San with fried Baizhu, Mu Xiang, and Viticis Fructus. If damp heat ascends, add Atractylodes.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Dongyi Baojian</strong> [Joseon, Xu Jun]</p>
<p><strong>Nape Weakness</strong></p>
<p>Nape weakness refers to the Tianzhu bone being misplaced; it is advisable to use Jian Gu San and Sheng Jin San. When a child suffers from long-term malnutrition and has a weak body, or when the Tianzhu bone is displaced due to various illnesses, and the physician cannot identify it, this is known as five weaknesses. If a child has a soft neck due to wind, causing the head to tilt forward or backward, Tianzhu Wan and Wujia Pi San should be used; if due to wind-heat, it is appropriate to use Liang Gan Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Not Growing</strong></p>
<p>Hair not growing is due to insufficient nourishment of qi and blood, failing to nourish the hair; it is advisable to take Congrong Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Disorders</strong></p>
<p>If a newborn shows a lack of quick eye movement when observing objects, and by age four or five the pupils are completely white and unclear, extending into old age without treatment, this is due to excessive heat received during gestation.</p>
<p><strong>Eyes Not Aligning</strong></p>
<p>If an infant’s eyes are misaligned, wanting to look east but seeing west, and shaking their head continually affects sight, this is due to the liver being disturbed by wind; it is advisable to take Niu Huang Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Growths</strong></p>
<p>If growths appear on the eyelids, starting as large as a sesame seed and gradually growing like a bean, hanging down inside the eyelid, this is caused by wind-heat attacking the spleen channel; it is advisable to take Wutui San with modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Color Blindness</strong></p>
<p>If a fetus is affected by wind, leading to disharmony of the internal organs, resulting in vomiting yellow bile, both eyes being unclear in vision without any treatment method, this condition of color blindness refers to pupils being distinctly black and white but unable to see objects clearly.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Kang Eye</strong></p>
<p>Children with kang-eye or strabismus may be blind or have retinas that do not see; they may also have pus. It is advisable to prepare liver pills and Longdan decoction.</p>

The yin obstructs the flow of yang from the foot Taiyang and Shaoyin meridians, preventing it from ascending to the eyes, hence the internal blockage of blue cataracts. It is important to supplement the yang first and then drain the fire of the foot Jueyin from the foot Taiyin meridian, rooted in the yang.</li>

<p>The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: for children with an inwardly sunken fontanel, cauterize half an inch above and below the navel, as well as the tip of the tailbone; also perform one moxibustion on each foot&#39;s Taiyin point. The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: if the fontanel is not closed, moxibustion should be applied to the points half an inch above and below the navel with three applications, cauterizing before sores develop. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: for children with a sunken fontanel, perform moxibustion on the Shuifen point seven times, and avoid acupuncture. The Shuifen point is located one inch below the xiphoid process and one inch above the navel, corresponding to the lower orifice of the small intestine. This is responsible for separating clarity from turbidity; fluids enter the bladder, waste into the large intestine, hence the term &#39;water division.&#39; Alternatively, if using acupuncture, a length of three-tenths can be applied, and five moxibustions are then needed. Changqiang is also named Qizhi Yinque and Juegu, located at the tip of the sacral spine, measured at three-tenths; it must be accessed by lying prone. The points of the foot&#39;s Shaoyin and Shaoyang converge with the Governing Vessel and branch off to connect with the Conception Vessel.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>The &quot;Genji Qiwei&quot; says: For treating children with squint who cannot see at night, moxibustion should be applied one inch inward from the big toe&#39;s nail at the horizontal white meat junction, using one large cone of moxa, about the size of a small wheat grain. </p>
<p>The &quot;Weisheng Baojian&quot; says: For children with malnutrition-related eye issues, moxibustion should be applied at each of the He Gu points, using one large cone, about the size of a small wheat grain, located between the two bones at the base of the big and index fingers. </p>
<p>The &quot;Yixue Wangmu&quot; says: For children with blurry vision due to milk nodules, moxibustion should be applied to two Zhong Yu points on the shoulder, each with one large cone, situated two inches from the spine at the inner edge of the shoulder blade. </p>
<p>The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Tong&quot; says: For children aged three to five, if they suddenly develop a white film covering their pupils during spring and autumn, with unbearable pain, moxibustion should be applied to the Dazhui point with one large cone. </p>
<p>If a child has variola affecting the eyes, moxibustion should be applied to two Dazhui points, located one and a half inches to either side beneath the first cervical vertebra. </p>
<p>For children who are sensitive to light and have symptoms resembling a &quot;blue blind,&quot; moxibustion should be applied to both Zhong Zhu points with one large cone, located in the depression at the base of the middle finger and the adjacent finger. </p>

<p>In Wan&#39;s &quot;Elaboration on Childhood Medicine,&quot; it is stated: A child with a thin neck was often inquired about by his father regarding proper care. I replied: The neck is the pillar of the head; if it is thin, it cannot support the essence. Care should be taken by the parents, and we can discuss it again after he turns eight. Unfortunately, he died at the age of five.</p>
<p>Another child had a cranial deformity and was not yet one year old. He could recognize characters and read, and his parents were very fond of him. I said: This child has insufficient prenatal endowment; the kidney is weak, and the true yang is inadequate. His intelligence developed early, leading to a leakage of true yang. I fear this will worry the parents. He passed away before reaching one year, having experienced convulsions.</p>
<p>A third child had four sutures open on the head, with a smooth and tight scalp, and very small eyes. I said: The brain is the sea of marrow. The kidneys govern the bones; with hidden fire in the marrow, it becomes hot, leading to a fractured skull. A large forehead and small eyes are the result. It would be advisable to take Rehmannia Pills. However, the parents did not believe this, and the child died at the age of fourteen.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>A young child suffered from many abscesses on the head, experiencing chills and fever, with pain persisting, particularly in summer, indicating a tangible illness. Initially, a dose of Ren Shen Bai Du San was administered, along with Huang Lian and Xiang Ru, which immediately alleviated the pain. Next, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was given; within three doses, the larger abscess drained pus, while the smaller ones resolved on their own. However, after eating rich food, the condition reoccurred; a dose of Qing Wei San and Huo Ming Yin each cured the ailment.</p>
<p>Another young child had swelling and pain on the head and face, with redness indicating heat toxin in the stomach channel. Initially, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was used, followed by Qing Wei San, achieving recovery. Later, sores appeared on the mouth and tongue. Additional powdered medicine was applied; the child experienced severe abdominal pain, a heavy feeling, vomiting, and coldness in the hands and feet. I suspected spleen and stomach deficiency due to cold, and treated with Yi Gong San plus Sheng Ma, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A newborn baby developed a poisonous swelling about an inch high on the head, with a red halo, indicating a critical condition. Cupping was performed, yielding dark blood and the child stabilized. The next day, a similar issue appeared between the eyebrows, with a red halo as well. I deemed cupping appropriate; after discussion, it was cupped on the second day. However, the blood clotted and could not be drawn out, leading to abdominal swelling and death.</p>
<p>Another young child experienced heat toxin on the head and face, and after taking Qing Wei medicine, the swelling and pain worsened. I concluded that the toxic qi was intense, causing stagnation of blood. Two doses of Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin led to recovery. Subsequently, due to food injury, the child experienced morning chills and evening fevers, with a recurrence of symptoms on the head and face. After administering fire-reducing medicine, the mouth and tongue became red and swollen, with coldness in the hands and feet.

<p>A boy aged fourteen, with a soft skull, felt his head was large, perceived everything as large, and was afraid of sunlight and ashamed of brightness. This was due to a weakness in his kidney essence. He was treated with Six-Flavor Pills combined with Five-Flavor Deer Antler, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with yam and dogwood, gradually recovering over half a year, with the fontanelle closing after two years. After marriage, however, the fontanelle reopened, and the soles of his feet felt as if they were burning. He was advised to abstain from sexual desire and eat less rich foods, taking the aforementioned medicine in two doses, and was cured after three years. Later, he suffered from weak legs after engaging in sexual activity and was instructed to continue taking the previous pills and adhere to the same precautions, eventually recovering.</p>
<p>A boy aged fourteen became interested in women, experiencing fever and phlegm; he felt his eyes were sensitive to bright light, and his head felt swollen.

<p>Another child had a sunken forehead and suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, with hands and feet cold. I used a white atractylodes powder mixed with nutmeg and dried ginger, and the child recovered. Later, after suffering from abdominal pain due to overeating, the hands and feet again grew cold; I administered &quot;Liujunzi Decoction&quot; with dried ginger, leading to recovery. The child experienced dizziness and drooling at the mouth, indicating severe deficiency and cold of the spleen and stomach, so I promptly added Aconite and the child recovered.</p>
<p>A child who was ill had a forehead that was either sunken or swollen, indicating excess heat of the spleen and stomach. In the morning, I administered &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; with Vitex fruit, dried ginger, and nutmeg, resulting in the forehead returning to normal. However, the child experienced diarrhea and dry mouth, so I used white atractylodes powder to enhance stomach energy, resulting in recovery.</p>

The hands and feet were hot, and the neck was soft with a sunken forehead. By afternoon, his complexion turned pale, the hands and feet were cold, and his pulse was weak and nearly undetectable. I urgently administered &quot;Liujunzi Decoction&quot; with Aconite; with one dose, all symptoms quickly resolved, and the forehead returned to normal. Children easily show signs of deficiency or excess, so even in critical conditions, if appropriate medication is administered promptly, recovery is possible.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>A nine-year-old child, after vomiting and diarrhea, had a soft neck, pale face, cold hands and feet, and a faint, fine pulse.

I then supplemented with the Eight Ingredients Pill. After a month, his complexion had a slight yellow tinge, and his stomach energy was somewhat restored. I continued with the previous medicine, and after another month, his appetite slightly increased, and the heat had significantly diminished. I began using the Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction in the morning and the Eight Ingredients Pill before meals; after another month, his vitality gradually recovered, and his appetite returned to normal. After another month, his muscles strengthened, and all illnesses were resolved.</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old child, after malaria, had a soft neck, cold hands and feet, and little appetite. If he ate porridge or soup slightly removed from the fire, he felt cold in his abdomen. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added cinnamon and dried ginger, and his appetite gradually improved; I added anise and pepper to his food. After a month, he could eat porridge slightly off the fire: I also used the previous medicine for a hundred doses, and his appetite was normal, with warm hands and feet. After another month, he could lift his head. Later, his appetite stagnated, and he experienced vomiting and diarrhea, still with a weak neck. In the morning, I used the Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added or reduced Eight Ingredients Pill. After more than two months, he could lift his head again. After a marriage, his vision became blurry, his neck bones felt weak, and his head felt heavy. I used the Eight Ingredients Pill and the Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction, and after more than three months, his vitality was restored, and all symptoms receded.

If not for careful management of the illness, even this medicine would not have helped.</p>
<p>In Xue&#39;s &quot;External Medicine Heart Method,&quot; it is stated that a child suffering from white sores on the head has smooth skin and a quick onset; none of the medicines worked. This condition is called brain sores, caused by fetal toxins combined with wind-heat. Treatment involves taking Longdan pills and blowing aloe vera powder into the nose, along with applying detoxifying powder, resulting in recovery. In severe cases, if the sores are lumped like ears, with brain heat akin to fire, profuse sweating, swollen jaw, and elevated chest, this medicine should be taken.</p>
<p>A young child had several sores on the head and face, causing itching and oozing fluid, resulting in sores wherever the fluid spread—this is called yellow water sores.

Use Six-Flavor Pill with added deer antler and Schisandra fruits, and within half a year, the child recovers.</p>

<p>A child is afflicted with itchiness at the hairline on the left ear, gradually spreading to the head. This indicates heat toxin in the liver and gallbladder meridians. Use Bupleurum Liver Clearing Powder for both mother and child, and they recover. Later, without dietary restraint, the condition recurs, with pus and fluid leaking, and the right cheek is red. This indicates heat in the stomach meridian. First, use Stomach Clearing Powder, followed by Bupleurum Liver Clearing Powder to treat liver fire, for both mother and child; also use Immediate Effect Powder and Cow Bile Detox Pill, and they recover.</p>
<p>Xue&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Protecting Infants&quot; states: A child has swollen cheeks without changing color, with loose stools, indicating deficient heat in the stomach meridian. Use Five-Flavored Powder with added Cimicifuga and Bupleurum, and the child recovers. Another instance: a wet nurse drinks alcohol and gets angry, causing both cheeks to swell and urges chills with fever.

<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A young child from the Huang family had a red swollen face and couldn’t open his eyes. A person used a (Jinfei) needle to lightly pierce and drain the area; apart from the eyes, dozens of needles were pricked randomly, causing blood to flow three times, and then it healed. Many people are unwilling to follow this method, insisting on treating the illness while being overly cautious!</p>
<p>A young child had red eyes, and his mother bought malachite to wash his eyes. Boiling it, the family mistakenly allowed the child to drink it, leading to severe vomiting, and after vomiting, his condition immediately improved.</p>
<p>A boy from the Wang family in Qingzhou was over ten years old and had red eyes with excessive tears; various treatments were ineffective. A person observed and said: This child’s eye disease stems from being frightened in his mother’s womb. The father replied: During pregnancy, we were surrounded in Linqing. The person instructed to administer Guati powder with added Yujin, promoting upward flow and resulting in a significant discharge of saliva. Everyone laughed at this. The mother also said: There’s no illness in the child’s belly, so why such vomiting and diarrhea? By the next day, his eyes were bright and clear. Li Zhong&#39;an saw this and was astonished, saying: Remarkable! This method saves lives! That day, he also bled from the head, and blood came from both eyebrows and nostrils. During vomiting, a dose of Tongjing powder (two qian) and 72 pills of Zhouchuan Wan were used, leading to a significant reduction in vomit; another dose of Tongjing powder (one qian) was administered.

I diagnosed her cold and hot chest pain as a sign of the liver&#39;s Shao Yin pathways; the film starting from the outer canthus indicated a sign of the liver’s Shao Yang pathways. The left pulse was taut and rapid, indicating liver wind-heat combined with blood stagnation. Therefore, I prescribed a modified version of Xiao Yao San with additional Fang Feng and Long Dan Cao, and after four doses, her cold and heat chest pain notably diminished; using Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for over a month led to the disappearance of the film.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>A young boy, fifteen years old, has white opacity in both eyes, abdominal distension, and his entire body appears to have a condition resembling scabies yet is not.

With ginseng stomach-nourishing soup, he gradually improved, and further recovered with five-flavor subtle efficacy powder and the herbal remedy for children.</p>
<p>A nine-year-old child, who had a history of liver heat, developed cataracts in both eyes. After taking aloe and herbal remedies for children, he recovered.

He was treated with middle supplementing energy soup and ginseng stomach-nourishing soup, along with the herbal remedy for children, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had slightly swollen eyelids, cough, nausea, and pale urine. I considered this a spleen problem with food retention. I used five-flavor subtle efficacy powder primarily, supplemented by the herbal remedy for children, and he recovered. Later, due to dietary indiscretion, his night vision became poor again. I explained that this was damage to the spleen and stomach, requiring nourishment as the primary treatment. Doubting this, he took harsh medicines, which later led to a wind illness, and he became unable to rise.</p>
<p>A child developed a fever and sweated, with red eyes and spasms. Upon examining the mother, she had a history of liver heat and fever. I used the subtle efficacy powder with added bupleurum and elevation hemp, and both mother and child improved slightly.

I further prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang intermittently, and the eye affliction healed.</p>
<p>Lastly, a child suffered fever and related symptoms due to the anger of the wet nurse, along with eye pain and vomiting. First, I administered Xiao Chai Hu Tang, and both mother and child took it, resulting in immediate relief.

I then supplemented with Si Wei Fei Er Wan, and after over a month, he was cured.</p>
<p>A child complained of eye pain. When treated with fire-clearing medicines for the liver, it instead caused increased photophobia, redness, and nighttime anxiety along with crying.

He then used the Congming Yiqi Decoction combined with the previous pills, which cured him, but the issue recurred. He appeared emaciated, with a rapid and strong pulse. He took the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction along with the previous pills and was cured.</p>
<p>There was a child who experienced spasms due to fright, which caused eye twitching. Initially, he was treated with a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Wutong and Huanglian to clear liver heat. Then, he took the Dihuang Pill to nourish the kidney and support the liver, resulting in a cure.</p>
<p>Another child had conjunctivitis, with either redness or frequent wiping of the brow. This was due to wind-heat in the liver meridian, indicating the onset of liver sores. He was treated with the Siwei Fei&#39;er Pill by adding Gentian and achieved a cure.</p>
<p>A child presenting with excessive white in the eyes, vomiting phlegm, and convulsions was treated primarily with the Dihuang Pill, supplemented with the Yiping Pill to stop the convulsions. Later, using the widely known Dihuang Pill resulted in increased darkness in the pupils.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old girl experienced eye pain, occasional itching, headaches, or pain in both sides, sometimes accompanied by chills or fever, internal heat, thirst, and reduced appetite, suggesting deficiency of qi and blood in the liver and spleen with heat. She was treated with the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Chai Hu Qinggan Powder, which healed her. Subsequently, a lump formed above her left eyebrow, about the size of a bean, gradually enlarging to the size of a chestnut, becoming necrotic and painful. This indicated dryness in the liver with blood-related issues. She was treated with a modified Xiaoyao Powder, leading to the necrotic tissue falling off after a month, followed by the Ba Zhen Decoction and the previous medicine, resulting in a complete recovery.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>A nine-year-old boy had an ongoing fear of brightness in his eyes, which had not improved over time. Some believed it was due to excess heat, and he was given laxatives like Qingwan, but it only worsened the condition. He sought treatment from me and still wanted to purge the liver. I suggested that since it was liver-related deficient heat, he should take Dihuang pills to replenish it, and he recovered. The liver&#39;s qi is yang and heat, while the liver&#39;s blood is yin and water. Liver conditions, unless caused by liver fire or blood dryness leading to wind, are typically due to deficient liver blood causing fire. In the case of an acute condition presenting with both sickness and a vigorous appearance, it is appropriate to use laxatives like Qingwan sparingly; for chronic cases with both sickness and weak appearance, Dihuang pills should be used to nourish the kidney and liver. The reason for this condition is often insufficient liver blood leading to the generation of wind, so harsh purgatives should not be used. The classic states that for weak diseases, one should nourish their source; for strong diseases, one should drain their offshoot. In a previous case where there was clear evidence of liver heat, treatments like Chaihu and Huanglian were suitable to address the heart&#39;s heat. The practitioner must be discerning.</p>
<p>A thirteen-year-old boy experienced prolonged eye pain, gradually developing a greenish film, and later became red and decayed. His left pulse was stringy and rapid. Treatment with Jiuwwei Luohui pills and an enhanced version of Xiaoyao powder led to recovery. After the illness recurred, Dihuang kidney essence pills were used as the main remedy, along with the modified Xiaoyao powder, resulting in health restoration.</p>
<p>A fifteen-year-old boy experienced red and painful eyes due to overexertion, along with fever and thirst; his pulse was large but weak. I prescribed Bazhen soup with a dose of fried black gardenia, which rapidly alleviated his symptoms. Subsequently, I used Buzhong Yiqi soup, leading to his recovery. Later, he experienced nocturnal emissions and his eye pain returned. I prescribed Liuwuwei Dihuang pills with additional ingredients, using five-flavor fruit for two doses, which stopped the pain. After approximately thirty more doses, his vision was restored.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>A child exhibited symptoms of a greenish hue in the eyes and was continuously crying and thrashing about. Treatment with Niu Huang Qing Xin Pills was ineffective, worsening the situation with teeth grinding and agitation, leading to bedwetting. This was attributed to severe deficiency of blood and qi in the liver channel. I treated it with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had convulsions and fixated eyes, indicating wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder channels. I first administered Chai Hu Qing Gan San to clear the liver, followed by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>In Wan&#39;s &quot;Pediatrics Expanded,&quot; it is noted: A four-year-old girl from the Wang family had a lump behind her ear, and they consulted me. I stated it was not a sore but rather a phlegm nodule, which required no treatment and posed no harm. Other doctors were misled, diagnosing it as a sore, and prescribed excessive medicine for removing it, which harmed the spleen and stomach, leading to malnutrition and death. How tragic! Horseflies often appear in front and behind the ears, causing swelling, stiffness, and red pain, commonly known as mumps; applying Bai Du San yields remarkable effects.</p>
<p>In Xue&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Baby Care,&quot; it is mentioned: A child had pus coming from the ear, foul-smelling and unapproachable, persisting for years, with thirst and hot feet, and possibly slightly darkened facial complexion. I diagnosed this as kidney malnutrition and prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. The mother was instructed to take Jia Wei Xiao Yao San for improvement. Later, due to separate treatment with liver-quelling medicines, the symptoms recurred: cold and heat, pale face, frequent urination. This indicated liver fire and dry blood; I used Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear the liver and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys, ultimately resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>A young child had pus coming from the ear, which did not heal for a long time. Upon examining the mother, her face appeared pale and yellow, indicating that it was due to the distress caused by the wet nurse. Thus, in the morning, a modified Guipi Decoction was given, and in the evening, a modified Xiaoyao Powder was used; both mother and child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child, aged twelve, was naturally weak and thin, with pus and water coming from the ear, sometimes causing pain or itching. By the age of fourteen, after increased treatment, he displayed fever, fatigue, and weakness in the legs for eight years. A combination of the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pills slightly improved his condition. After marriage, he disregarded restrictions, leading to chills and fever, along with saliva and phlegm in his throat. I noted that kidney deficiency could not control water, leading to phlegm-like symptoms, while the clear energy could not rise, resulting in dizziness, and the Yang energy could not protect the skin, causing chills and fever. Therefore, I applied Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with a bit of Vitex and Aconite; after four doses with no response, I used one ounce of Ginseng and a bit of Aconite, and he responded after two doses. Subsequently, over a hundred doses of the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction were given, leading to full recovery. However, after excessive exertion in the bedroom, he experienced a hoarse throat and surging phlegm, with weakness in his legs; using Dihuang Yinzi immediately alleviated the symptoms, and I continued with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction for stability. Later, he experienced inappropriate daily routines, with morning chills and evening fevers, cold in the limbs, shortness of breath, and abundant phlegm, with a weak pulse. I administered Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction with a small amount of Aconite and a few doses led to improvement; I then removed the Aconite and used three drams of Ginseng for ongoing treatment, which resulted in stability.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>A young child had pus flowing from the ear, a lump in the neck, and experienced pain or redness in the eyes. The child also had a burning sensation or difficulty with urination, all symptoms attributed to wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder meridians. Treatment with Four-Ingredient Fat Child Pill led to complete recovery. </p>
<p>Another child became ill after the wet nurse was angry and, following her menstrual period, consumed a lot of fried food, resulting in ear pain and pus discharge. I initially used a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, followed by a modified Xiao Yao San, which the mother took, leading to recovery for both mother and child.</p>
<p>A different child had foul-smelling discharge from the ear, indicating insufficiency in the liver and kidneys. I first administered the Nine-Ingredient Aloe Pill, resulting in healing. However, after a while, the child appeared pale, feverish, and frequently ill. I then used herbs like Huang Lian and Zhimu to address additional symptoms of chest distension, loss of appetite, and phlegm obstruction; I also focused on promoting qi and resolving phlegm. I treated with Liu Jun Zi and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoctions, adding ingredients like Gan Jiang and Mu Xiang, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>A ten-year-old child suffered from prolonged nosebleeds and had a taut pulse. The liver stores blood, and this indicated reckless movement of liver fire and heat. I administered four doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with additions of Shan Zhi and Long Dan Cao, which stopped the bleeding; I also used Si Wu, Qian, Lian, Aloe, Shan Zhi, and Licorice to make pills for oral intake. Additionally, I applied Di Huang Pill to nourish kidney water and generate liver blood, resulting in a cure. </p>
<p>Another child had chronic nosebleeds, and there was slight redness on the right cheek and nasal tip, suggesting that heat from the spleen and stomach was transmitted to the lungs without regulation. Initially, I used Liu Jun Zi, Jie Geng, Dang Gui, and Shan Zhi to halt the bleeding. Subsequently, I utilized Ren Shen and Huang Qi Powder to tonify and support the spleen and lungs, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>A young child has a cough, nausea, a stuffy nose, and runny nose with a pale blue right cheek. This is due to deficiency of spleen and lung qi, allowing external pathogens to invade. Initially, use Xingsheng Powder, and the cough will quickly improve; however, if there is loss of appetite and coldness in the hands and feet, add a dose of Shengma to the Six Gentlemen Decoction to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>Another child has tidal fevers, nasal bleeding, thirst, constipation, and coughing with shortness of breath, showing a red right cheek. This indicates heat in the lungs and large intestine. Using Chaihu Decoction will quickly resolve all symptoms; if symptoms recur later due to fright, with slight twitching and distress, this indicates deficiency of liver, spleen, and blood. Use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Tailiang Gou for recovery.</p>
<p>Another child has widespread scabies, nasal bleeding, due to heat in the liver and spleen. Use the Four Ingredients for Fat Children Pills for recovery. Later, after eating roasted foods, nasal bleeding recurs, and scabs reappear. First, use Clear Stomach Powder twice, followed by a month of Four Ingredients for Fat Children Pills for a complete cure.</p>
<p>Another child has nasal bleeding, food retention in the jaw, thirst, and occasional sweating, indicating heat in the stomach channel. First, use Yellow Drain Powder twice to stop food retention in the jaw, then administer the Four Ingredients for Fat Children Pills several times until the nasal bleeding resolves. Later, if there are intermittent itching and thirst with blood in stool, use Shengji Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction for four doses, for both mother and child; separately, have the child take Four Ingredients for Fat Children Pills for a month until cured.</p>
<p>Another child has nasal bleeding, fever, thirst, and a cyanotic right cheek. This suggests liver fire invading the spleen. Begin with Modified Xiao Yao Powder for both mother and child, and the fever and thirst will gradually subside; then use the Five Flavor Yigong Powder with a little Chaihu and Shengma, and both will recover.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>A young child had a nosebleed and took a hemostatic medicine, but instead developed blood in the stool. The child’s right cheek was yellow or red, indicating the spleen was weak and unable to control the blood. I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and additionally, the Wu Wei Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child had a nosebleed that persisted for a long time, feeling weak in the limbs, experiencing little appetite and thoughts of food, and being averse to wind and cold. This indicated a deficiency in the spleen and lungs. I first used the Wu Wei Yi Gong San, which stopped the nosebleed; then I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to alleviate the aversion to wind and cold; subsequently, I applied the Si Jun Zi Tang with slight additions of Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>A different child had a nosebleed and red spots on the chin; I suspected insufficiency of kidney energy and fiery deficiency. I was not believed, and the child took a separate cooling medicine that worsened the condition. I used the Di Huang Wan, which proved effective. Later, with signs of deficiency appearing, I used the Ba Zhen Tang and Di Huang Wan and soon attained recovery.</p>
<p>A child experiencing a nosebleed accompanied by thirst, wheezing, and a flushed face indicated heart fire damaging the lungs and metal element. I used the Ren Shen Ping Fei San along with Di Huang Wan, adding Wu Wei and Mai Men Dong, and the child was healed.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old girl had a nasal polyp and applied a toxic medicine, which resulted in swelling and pain. I applied powdered Huang Lian, Gan Cao, and Huang Bai externally to relieve heat toxicity; then I used the Jia Wei Xiao Yao San to clear liver fire; I complemented this with Si Wei Fei Er Wan, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another girl often had polyps in her nose and lower part that protruded out about three inches each time she used caustic drugs. I first treated her with Long Dan Cao Tang primarily, and added Jia Wei Xiao Yao San as a supplementary treatment, resulting in her recovery.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>A weak child has a penchant for eating soil, charcoal, and ashes. Later, he has trouble breathing through his nose, and after strictly taking cooling medicines, his body becomes even thinner, eats little, is warm to the touch, and is easily startled and irritable. His urine is delayed and turns white, and there are two-inch polyps in his nose. There is a small lump in the neck, hidden between the muscles. I believe this is a transformation due to deficiency in the liver and spleen. Not trusting this, they cleared internal lung fire and applied corrosives externally, resulting in throat corrosion. I initially used a modified Wumei Yigong Powder with Shengma, Chaihu, and Wutui as the main ingredients, supplemented with the Four-Flavor Fei&#39;Er Pill, which gradually strengthened the spleen&#39;s energy; in the evening, I used the Nine-Flavor Aloe Pill as the main treatment, supplemented with Wumei Yigong Powder, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child has difficulty urinating, a dry nose, and nosebleeds, with a red color in his nostrils; he has heat in the spleen and lungs. I used the Jisheng Xijiao Dihuang Decoction, and the previous condition was resolved. Later, the area below the chin remains red, thirst occurs, and there is phlegm, indicating insufficient kidney qi. I used the Dihuang Pill, and all conditions were healed.</p>
<p>Xue’s &quot;External Medicine Heart Method&quot; states that a child has sores on the outside of the nose, which, if not rubbed regularly, extend to both ears, and various drugs are ineffective. Using the Aloe Pill for oral intake and applying rosin and mung bean powder led to recovery.</p>
<p>A child has a cough with wheezing, high fever, chills, skin resembling millet, an itchy nose with a runny nose, a sore throat, rotten gums with blood, abdominal distension with a feeling of fullness, and diarrhea, named lung syphilis. I treated it with the Dihuang Qingfei Drink and the Xia (Shangniuxia) Pills for a cure.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

<p>小儿头面耳目鼻病门</p>
<p>　　　　千金方 【唐　孙思邈】</p>
<p>　　　　　头疮</p>
<p>　　论曰：小儿头生小疮，浸淫疽痒，黄膏出，不生痂，连年不瘥者，名妒头疮。以赤龙皮汤及天麻汤洗之，内服漏芦汤，外宜敷飞乌膏散，及黄连胡粉水银膏散。<br>　　　　小儿直诀 【宋　钱乙】</p>
<p>　　　　　解颅</p>
<p>　　解颅者，生下顖门不合也，长必多愁少笑，目白睛多，面色晃白，肢体消瘦，皆肾虚也。　　 【注　按肾主髓，脑为髓之海，前证因父母精血不足，不能荣养，宜用地黄丸补之。有至七八岁或十四五岁，气血既盛而自合。若纵恣饮食色欲，戕贼真阴，亦不能尽其寿矣。此证若在乳下，当兼补其母，更以软帛紧束儿首，使其易合。亦有顖陷顖填，俱属禀不足。或五疳久病，元气亏损者，仍参后小便不通类主之。】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　　　　发迟</p>
<p>　　发久不生，生则不黑，皆胎弱也。<br>　　【注　前证即五迟之一证也。发者，肾之荣也。良由父母精血不足，肾气虚弱，不能养荣而然耳。】<br>　　　　儒门事亲 【元　张从政】</p>
<p>　　　　　甜疮</p>
<p>　　凡小儿甜疮久不愈者，俗呼为香疮是也，多在面部两耳前。一法令母口中嚼白米成膏子，临卧涂之，不过三五上则愈矣。小儿并母皆忌鸡、猪、鱼、兔、酒、酢、动风发热之物。如治甜指，亦同此法。<br>　　　　　面上疮</p>
<p>　　凡小儿面上疮谓眉炼疮，耳上谓之辄耳，足上疮谓靴癣。此三者一究其本，皆谬名也。经曰：诸痛疮疡皆属心火。乃血热剧而致然也。或谓：《内经》曰大概，不可使热以为皆然。此不明造化之道也，慎勿妄信。可用(金非)针刺之出血，一次不愈，当复刺之；再刺不愈，则三刺必愈矣。《内经》曰：血实者决之。眉炼不可用药敷之。以其疮多痒，痒则爬矣；药入眼，则目必损矣。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　　　　白秃疮</p>
<p>　　夫小儿白秃疮者，俗呼为鸡粪秃者是也。可用甜瓜蔓龙头，不以多少，河水浸之一宿，以砂锅熬取极苦汁，滤去瓜蔓，以文武慢火熬成如稀饧状，盛于磁器中，可先剃头去尽疮痂，死血出尽，着河水洗净，却用熬下瓜蔓膏子一小盏，加半夏末二钱，生姜自然汁一两匙，狗胆一枚同调，不过三两上立可。大忌鸡、猪、鱼、兔、动风发热之物。<br>　　　　　目疾</p>
<p>　　《内经》曰：热胜则肿。治火之法，在药则咸寒，吐之下之；在针则神庭、上星、顖会、前顶、百会。血之翳者可使立退，痛者可使立已，眛者可使立明，肿者可使立消。惟小儿不可刺顖会，为肉分浅薄，恐伤其骨。然小儿水在上，火在下，故目明。<br>　　　　　疮疤入眼</p>
<p>　　小儿疮疤入眼者，乃余热不散耳。止宜降心火，泻肝风，益肾水，则愈矣。<br>　　　　　疳眼</p>
<p>　　夫小儿疳眼数日不开者，乃肝木风热之致然也。可调服凉膈散数服，眼开而愈。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　　　平治会萃 【元　朱震亨】</p>
<p>　　　　　解颅</p>
<p>　　解颅者，乃是母气虚，与热多耳。戴云：初生小儿头上骨未合而开者，宜以四君子汤、四物汤，有热加酒，芩、炒黄连、生甘草煎服；外以绢帛系紧，用白蔹末敷之。<br>　　　　　头癞</p>
<p>　　小儿头癞，用红炭焠长流水，令热洗之。又服酒制通圣散，除大黄酒炒外，以胡荽子、伏龙肝、悬龙尾、黄连、白矾为末调敷。<br>　　　　奇效良方 【明　方贤】</p>
<p>　　　　　解颅</p>
<p>　　顖门乃母气血充实，令儿顖门坚实而耐养；如母多病，气血虚弱，令儿顖门虚软而不实。又后顶顖乃父之精，元气充实，令儿后顶上坚硬而耐养；如父之元气不足，鴆酒多欲，令儿后顶虚孔不坚，亦不寿。如父母俱怯，生下儿女俱不寿。若如此其父母自亦不能保于天年。前顖又曰信门，道家为泥丸，后信名脑后顶门，头中心顶上又名百会穴。华佗看面部诀载甚详。顖与信同音。凡前后信及百会开而虚，名解颅。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　发黄</p>
<p>　　发乃血之余。母之血气充实，则发黑而光润；如母之血虚，带漏败堕，月事不调，或鴆酒多淫，或母胎有息，令儿发黄焦槁，生疳热疮痍之患。<br>　　　　片玉心书 【明　万全】</p>
<p>　　　　　解颅</p>
<p>　　肾主骨髓，脊者髓之路，脑者髓之海也。肝之脉与肾脉，内行于脊骨之中，上会于脑。故头破解颅脊疳之病，乃肝肾之风热，子传于母之病也。　　解颅者有二：或生下之后，头缝四破，头皮光急，日渐长大，眼楞紧小，此髓热也。　　又有生下五六个月后，顖门已合而复开者，此等小儿大数难养。肾肝风热之病，宜加味泻青丸主之，所谓实则泻其子也。芦荟泻青丸加黄蘗、黄芩、黄连等分，碾末蜜丸服。　　解颅八物，有热加连。以绵系束，香附、白蔹。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　顖肿</p>
<p>　　乳食不常饥饱起，寒热积脾气上冲。致成顖肿随轻重，风热相交未易攻。治宜退热疏风证，泻青丸子显神功。<br>　　　　　顖陷</p>
<p>　　泻泄久而气血虚，不能上冲元气亏。狗脊炙黄为细末，鸡卵白调服即愈。药用参苓白朮散，服之顖陷顿能除。<br>　　　　　脑疳</p>
<p>　　脑疳者，小儿生后，生疮成饼，状如覆盘，此风热也。宜加味泻青丸加蔓荆子、白蒺藜炒。<br>　　　　　发迟</p>
<p>　　发乃血之余，肾之苗也。小儿发久不生，虽生不黑而稀，此由肾气衰而血气不足之故也。地黄丸主之。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　育婴家秘 【明　万全】</p>
<p>　　　　　解颅</p>
<p>　　儿本虚怯，由胎气不成，则神气不足，目中白睛多，其颅即解，面色混白，此皆难养，纵长不过二八之数。若戒色欲，多不过四旬而亡。　　解颅有二：初生后头骨渐开，此胎气怯弱，肾不足也。有合而复开者，自颅至印堂有破痕可开一分，又有头四破成缝者，此皆解颅。由病后肾虚，水不胜火，火气上蒸，其髓则热，髓热则解，而头骨复分开矣。肾虚者，宜服地黄丸以补肾之不足，调元汤、十全大补汤，母子共服之，以补脾胃，使气血渐实，其颅自合矣。其髓热者，宜通圣散为丸服，去硝不用；外用封顖法，或用软帛紧束。有作巾遮护，久而自合，亦良法也。　　又有儿生后头渐大，头皮赤，眼光小，此脑疳也。乃受父母热毒之气，藏于肾中，上熏于脑，故头大渐红也。此难养，不出二八之数。其未周岁满头生疮结饼，作痒作痛，儿不能忍，日夜啼哭者，亦难养也。宜服前苦参丸，及松皮散敷之。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　　顖填顖陷</p>
<p>　　顖填顖陷诀云：热甚则肿，虚热则陷。　　顖填者，顖门肿起骨高突也。经云：热甚则肿，由邪火炎上，使清明之气上升而不降。其证有二：以手摸之肿坚实者，此有寒邪在表，腠理闭，寒热不得出，所谓气上冲则坚劲者是也。宜升阳散火汤，此郁则发之也。如摸之其肿虚浮者，此积热在里，熏蒸于上，所谓气上冲则柔软者是也。宜酒制神芎丸，此高则抑之也。一发一下，中病即止。<br>　　　　　头疮</p>
<p>　　头生胞疮者，勿因皮破成疮，脓水不干，头毛粘结，内生虱，痒则抓之，年久不愈，有成癞头。当先去其虱，用石菖蒲煎汤洗之，其虱尽死；待干，用水银、腻粉二味放碗中，以指研匀，入津调湿，指蘸药搽疮上四畔及发内。虱尽去，方用秋牛皮窑口上烟胶不拘多少，松香研末入轻粉少许、雄黄少许，熬热，热油调涂患处。头生软疖者，年久不愈，用紫金丹涂之，效。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　　　　发迟</p>
<p>　　头之有发，犹山之有草木也。发者血之余，发之多寡，由于血之盛衰也。坎为血卦，血者肾之液，发者肾之苗也，故其色黑也。儿发久不生，生不黑者，皆肾虚也。宜地黄丸主之。　　大病后其发成穗，或稀少者，乃津液不足，疳劳之外候也，宜集圣散主之。<br>　　　　幼科发挥 【明　万全】</p>
<p>　　　　　顖陷</p>
<p>　　顖陷者，谓顖门陷下成坑也。其证有二：经云，陷者下气虚也。大病之后，津液不足，真气下陷，成坑窟者，宜大补元气，调元汤加升麻主之。有脾胃虚弱，饮食减少，脾主肌肉，肉去皮薄，顖门露见，非陷也。宜服肥儿丸、参苓白朮散，补脾胃则能饮食，肌肉自平，顖不露矣。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　　　　枕陷</p>
<p>　　又百后枕陷者，《活幼心书》谓其证尤重于顖陷者，此大虚极，百无一活。殊不知此非病也，乃父母之过也。初生儿头骨未合，当用菉豆作枕枕之，常与移动，勿使只在一边，则头骨必正矣。此后枕骨陷下者，乃儿卧日久之所致也。若难养则头骨四破，高下成缝者，皆非寿子也。<br>　　　　　颈软</p>
<p>　　头仰者颈软也。颈者头之茎也，一名天柱骨。颈软者，乃天柱骨不能任元而前后左右倾倒也，此恶病也。其证有二：小儿初生便颈软者，皆胎禀不足，肾气虚弱也。肾主骨，肝主筋，筋不束骨，其骨则折，母能令子虚也。此儿难养，纵长不及四旬。肾气虚矣，宜服地黄丸加当归、续断主之。有因大病之后，头骨不能起者，此血气虚弱也，宜十全大补汤炼蜜丸服。经云：头者，清明之府也。头仰斜敧，神将去矣。凡大病人有是证难治。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　　疳眼</p>
<p>　　此证多是饮食炙煿，甘辛积热，以致脾胃成疳上攻，眼目赤濇，乌珠有翳，久渐变白，宜速治疗；若不早除，多成痼疾。初服清热饮，次服五疳丸。<br>　　　　婴童百问 【明　鲁伯嗣】</p>

<p>　　海藏云：东垣治斑后风热余毒，翳膜气障遮睛，以泻青丸治之，大效。《保命集》云：退翳膜妙，不特斑后减大黄服。余以为肝经久蕴风热，乃生翳膜，泻青丸正所以拔病根也。　　小儿斑疹后毒上攻于目，翳膜肿痛，脉实强壮能食者，羚羊角散加减以解之。气血虚而胃弱者，须以补养为先，而佐以解毒，斯得之矣。丹溪曰：犀角性升散，较诸角尤甚，痘后有余毒者用之。如无余毒，虚虚之祸，如指诸掌，不可不知。<a id="orig-38p" href="#trans-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>　　　　　雀目</p>

<p>　　肾气盛者，顖小而合早；肾气怯者，解颅而顖不合。颅不瘥而病交攻，极难将护，最为大病。<br>　　　　　顖门肿陷论</p>
<p>　　小儿初生，皆有顖门者，脏气未充，骨髓未完，滋养未备故也。脏腑皆以脾胃为养，儿自生以后，得五谷所滋，则脏气充而骨髓完，所以儿至能食则顖门合也。顖门者，系于脾胃。《圣济经》言卫顖之天五，五者土也，脾胃属焉。小儿有顖肿者，由脾胃不和，冷热不调，或怒啼饮乳，或喘急咳嗽，致阴阳气逆上冲而顖肿也。热则肿而软，冷则肿而硬。又有顖陷者，或因泻痢，或小便频数，或曾服清药以利小便，或本怯气弱，或别病缠绵，皆使脏虚而不能上荣于顖，故令顖陷也。此皆小儿恶证，得愈者鲜矣。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>　　　　　头上诸病论</p>
<p>　　小儿头上生软疖者，由风邪冷热之气客于皮肤，持于血气，壅滞经络，蕴结而生，亦如身上生疖无异，但生在头上。始则赤肿而硬，其邪微者，散则自消；其邪甚者，肿赤内搐，溃脓血作痛。以头上皮紧，至熟多不能去脓根，中有恶汁不尽，因而复发，或在根边别生，连续不瘥，常常拱脓，故名曰软疖。　　小儿头有秃疮者，按九虫论云：是蛲虫动作，与风邪相乘，上于头之皮肤，搏于血气，伤其荣卫而所生也。荣为血，受病则为赤秃；卫为气，受病则为白秃。荣在内，邪稍难干，故患赤秃者少；卫在外，邪易得着，故患白秃者多。<a id="orig-40p" href="#trans-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>其始生如癣之斑点，上有皮屑，渐渐作痂，以成其疮，遂至满头发落殆尽。若刮去其痂，则疮皆是孔眼，大小不等。如虫之窠，有脓汁出，不痛而痒，痒乃不可禁，是知有虫为风也。又一种俗呼为鬼舐头，小儿有头疮，过夜被鬼舐之，则引及满头有赤痂，或云便赤秃也。　　小儿头疮者，由脏腑有热，上冲于头，外被风湿，复相乘之，搏于血气而生其疮，故曰头疮。此候与秃疮特异。且秃疮者，有白有赤，硬痂遍满其头。此头疮者，但一两处生其痂，并不白硬而干，时时常有脓血湿汁，俗呼为长头疮，小儿失于沐发者，便生此疮也。<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>　　　　　发</p>

<p>　　小儿有忽患耳聋沉听者，由风邪乘于手太阳之经也。邪随其经，入于耳内，邪正相搏，气停塞滞，则令耳聋不能聪听于音声也。轻者则为沉听，谓耳中沉沉然，轻小之音则不辨，重大之声才闻也。<a id="orig-42p" href="#trans-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>　　　　　耳中鸣痛</p>
<p>　　小儿有耳中或鸣或痛者，由风邪入耳，与正气相干，搏于血气者即为鸣，搏于经络者即为痛也。<br>　　　　　耳中肿疮出脓汁</p>
<p>　　小儿有耳中肿或生疮出脓汁者，由风湿相乘入于耳，邪正相干，搏于气血，伤于经络，轻则为肿，重则生疮。若津液结溃，变为脓血汁出。又有因水或眼泪入耳，停搏正气，亦为脓汁，俱名聤耳，又名脓耳也。<br>　　　　　眼目病论</p>
<p>　　小儿眼目生病者，多因恣食甘酸，脏生邪热，熏炙肝经，冲发于目，或为赤肿痒痛，或眵泪隐濇，或生赤脉，或生翳膜。又痰饮毒气渍肝，致脏气不得宣通者，则精华未得明审；故黑睛虽全而视物(目巟)(目巟)，此名睛盲。若昼日明，至瞑不见物者，此邪干经之阴也，谓之雀目。言如鸟雀之目，瞑时无所见也。又有障眼者，乃气毒障幔其睛也。又有肝疳之气冲于目者，亦能生其翳膜以为遮障也。<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>　　　　　鼻中病论</p>
<p>　　肺气通于鼻，气不和为风冷所乘，停滞鼻中，搏于津液，使涕凝结壅，气不通快，不闻臭香，谓之鼻塞。若风冷搏于血气，而生息肉塞滞者，谓之齆鼻。若风湿相搏，则鼻内生疮而有脓汁出也，若脑热攻鼻中干燥，或生疮痂，则硬而无脓汁也。<br>　　　　幼幼近编 【明　陈治】</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Collection of Medical Works from Antiquity to Present, Volume 411</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diseases of Children&#39;s Heads, Faces, Ears, Eyes, and Noses</strong></p>
<p><strong>From &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Head Sores</strong></p>
<p>It is said: For children with small sores on their heads, which are itchy and oozing yellow pus, and do not scab over, persisting for years without healing, are called &quot;jealous head sores.&quot; These should be washed with Red Dragon Skin Decoction and Tianma Decoction, taken internally with Liu Lu Decoction, and externally treated with Fei Wu Gao San and Huanglian Hu Fen Mercury Gao San.</p>
<p><strong>Children&#39;s Direct Prescriptions by Qian Yi (Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unhealed Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>Unhealed fontanelle refers to the incomplete closure of the fontanelle at birth. Such children generally tend to be more sorrowful than joyful; their sclerae are often too prominent, their faces pale and washed out, and their bodies lean, all indicative of kidney deficiency. </p>
<p>(Note: The kidneys govern marrow, and the brain is considered the sea of marrow. The aforementioned condition arises when the parents&#39; essence and blood are insufficient to nourish the child, and it is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to replenish them. If the child reaches seven or eight years old, or fourteen or fifteen years old, when Qi and blood are strong and the fontanelle naturally closes, they may be fine. However, if indulging in food and desires depletes true Yin, their lifespan cannot be fully realized. If this condition presents in infants, the mother should also be nourished, and the child&#39;s head should be tightly wrapped in soft cloth to facilitate closure. There may also be cases of recessed or filled fontanelles, both falling under insufficient constitution. Additionally, those suffering from lingering Five Taxations with depleted vital energy should also be monitored along with similar symptoms of urinary difficulty.)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　甜疮</p>
<p>　　凡小儿甜疮久不愈者，俗呼为香疮是也，多在面部两耳前。一法令母口中嚼白米成膏子，临卧涂之，不过三五上则愈矣。小儿并母皆忌鸡、猪、鱼、兔、酒、酢、动风发热之物。如治甜指，亦同此法。<br>　　　　　面上疮</p>
<p>　　凡小儿面上疮谓眉炼疮，耳上谓之辄耳，足上疮谓靴癣。此三者一究其本，皆谬名也。经曰：诸痛疮疡皆属心火。乃血热剧而致然也。或谓：《内经》曰大概，不可使热以为皆然。此不明造化之道也，慎勿妄信。可用(金非)针刺之出血，一次不愈，当复刺之；再刺不愈，则三刺必愈矣。《内经》曰：血实者决之。眉炼不可用药敷之。以其疮多痒，痒则爬矣；药入眼，则目必损矣。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Late Hair Growth</h3>
<p>If hair takes a long time to grow, and when it does, it is not black, it indicates weakness of the fetus.<br><em>Note: This is one of the five signs of late development. Hair is a manifestation of kidney vitality. This is mainly due to insufficient essence and blood from the parents, leading to weak kidney energy that cannot nourish the hair.</em></p>
<h3>Sweet Sores</h3>
<p>In children, if sweet sores do not heal for a long time, they are commonly called “fragrant sores,” mainly appearing on the face and in front of the ears. One method is to have the mother chew white rice into a paste and apply it before sleeping; it should heal in three to five applications. Both the child and mother should avoid chicken, pork, fish, rabbit, wine, vinegar, and anything that induces heat and wind. The treatment for sweet fingers follows the same method.</p>
<h3>Facial Sores</h3>
<p>Facial sores in children are referred to as eyebrow sores; ear sores are called ear sores; and foot sores are known as shoe fungi. These three terms, when examined, are all misnomers. The classics say: all painful sores are related to heart heat, resulting from severe blood heat. Some say: The “Internal Classic” states that generally, heat should not be assumed to apply to all cases. This is a misunderstanding of the way of nature; care should be taken not to be misled. A gold needle may be used to prick for blood; if it does not heal after one attempt, it should be pricked again. If it still does not heal after the second attempt, it will surely heal after the third attempt. The “Internal Classic” states: Blood that is abundant should be pricked. Eyebrow sores should not be treated with medicine, as they are often itchy; scratching may occur, and if the medicine gets into the eyes, it will cause damage.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>White Scalp</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as white scalp in children is commonly referred to as chicken dung baldness. One can use sweet melon vines and dragon head; there is no specific quantity required. Soak them in river water overnight, then boil in a clay pot to extract the extremely bitter juice. After filtering out the melon vines, use low heat to reduce it to a syrupy consistency and store it in ceramic containers. Before application, shave the head to remove all scabs and dead blood, then cleanse with river water. Afterward, take a small cup of the prepared melon vine extract, add two qian of fresh pinellia powder, one tablespoon of natural ginger juice, and one piece of dog bile together to mix. A dosage of just three qian is sufficient. It is crucial to avoid chicken, pork, fish, rabbit, and any foods that induce heat or wind.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;When heat prevails, there is swelling.&quot; To treat fire, the method involves using salty and cool medicines; emesis and purging are also effective. For acupuncture, target Shen Ting, Shang Xing, Yin Hui, Qian Ding, and Bai Hui points. Conditions like blood cloudiness can be quickly alleviated; pain can be promptly relieved; obscured vision can be restored; and swelling can be diminished. However, acupuncture should not be performed on the Yin Hui point in children, as the flesh is too thin and may damage the bones. Children’s conditions are governed by the water above and fire below, hence clear vision.</p>
<p><strong>Scabs in the Eye</strong></p>
<p>If a child&#39;s scabs enter the eye, it is due to residual heat not dissipating. The appropriate course of action is to reduce heart fire, drain liver wind, and nourish kidney water, leading to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Eye</strong></p>
<p>If a child&#39;s malnutrition-related eye condition does not improve for several days, it is caused by wind-heat from the liver. Administering Liang Ge San in several doses will aid in opening the eyes and promote healing.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Resolving Skull Issues</h3>
<p>Resolving skull issues occurs when the mother&#39;s energy is weak and there is an excess of heat. According to Dai Yun, for newborns whose skull bones have not yet fused and are open, it is advisable to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction and Four Substances Decoction, adding alcohol for heat, along with prepared cooked rhubarb, Scutellaria, roasted Coptis, and raw licorice, to be taken as a decoction. Externally, tie a silk cloth securely and apply a powder of white lanceolate.</p>
<h3>Head Sores</h3>
<p>For a child&#39;s head sores, use red charcoal to wash with flowing water, allowing the heat to cleanse it. Additionally, take a concoction of wine with Tong Sheng San (a traditional formula) while excluding the rhubarb prepared in wine, using ground coriander seeds, dragon’s liver, dragon&#39;s tail, Coptis, and white alum to mix into a paste for application.</p>
<h3>Excellent and Effective Methods</h3>
<p>Resolving skull issues relates to the fullness of maternal energy and blood, resulting in a firm and nurturing fontanelle in the child; if the mother is ill and her energy and blood are weak, the child&#39;s fontanelle will be soft and less substantial. The posterior fontanelle relates to the paternal essence; if the paternal energy is robust, the child&#39;s posterior fontanelle will be firm and nourishing. Conversely, if the father&#39;s energy is insufficient, due to excessive desire for drunkenness, the child’s posterior fontanelle will be soft and not durable, leading to a shorter life. If both parents are weak, their offspring will also have shortened lives. In such cases, the parents themselves may struggle to reach their full lifespan. The anterior fontanelle is also known as the &quot;Faith Gate&quot;; in Daoist terms, it is the &quot;Mud Ball,&quot; while the posterior fontanelle is referred to as the &quot;Brain Gate.&quot; The center of the head is also known as the &quot;Hundred Meetings.&quot; Hua Tuo provided detailed insights on facial diagnosis. The terms &quot;fontanelle&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; share the same pronunciation. When either the anterior or posterior fontanelles and the Hundred Meetings are open and weak, it is referred to as resolving skull issues.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yellowing of Hair</strong></p>
<p>Hair is the residue of blood. When a mother&#39;s blood and qi are plentiful, the hair is black, glossy, and vibrant; if the mother&#39;s blood is deficient, leaking, and failing, with menstrual irregularities, excessive indulgence in wine and lust, or if there are issues from the womb, the child&#39;s hair becomes yellow, dry, and brittle, leading to sores and boils.</p>
<p><strong>Headache Relief</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bone marrow, the spine is the pathway of the marrow, and the brain is the sea of marrow. The liver vessels and kidney vessels flow internally through the spine and converge in the brain. Hence, conditions affecting the head and pain in the spine are illnesses caused by wind-heat of the liver and kidneys, passed from mother to child. There are two types of headache relief: one occurs shortly after birth with the skull sutures split, the scalp appearing tight and glossy; this is due to heat in the marrow. The other occurs five to six months after birth when the fontanelle closes and then reopens; children of this situation are often difficult to nurture. For illnesses of wind-heat in the kidneys and liver, it is advisable to use a modified Qingpian pill to treat it, as it is to relieve the child. The Qingpian pill should be combined with equal parts of rhubarb, scutellaria, and coptis, ground into powder, formed into honey pills, and taken. The eight ingredients for relieving headaches include heat and additional components. Bind with cotton, including cyperus and white skullcap.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secrets of Infant Care</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</p>
<p><strong>Resolving Head Issues</strong></p>
<p>A child is inherently weak and timid; if the vital energy from the fetus is insufficient, the spirit becomes lacking, resulting in excessive white in the eyes, and the skull appears unlocked, with a pale complexion. Such children are difficult to raise and often do not live beyond eighteen years. If one restrains sexual desires, they may live a little longer but still not surpass forty days. </p>
<p>There are two types of unlocked skulls: one that gradually opens after birth due to weak fetal energy and insufficient kidney strength. If it closes and then reopens, there may be cracks from the skull to the glabella, which can open slightly. If there are four cracks forming sutures, these are all indications of an unlocked skull. If the child is weak after an illness, with kidney deficiency causing water to overpower fire, the fiery essence rises, resulting in heat in the marrow; when the marrow is hot, it unlocks and the skull separates again. For those with kidney deficiency, it is advisable to take Rehmannia Pills to replenish the kidney&#39;s insufficiency, along with &quot;Tiaoyuan Decoction&quot; and &quot;Shiquandabu Decoction&quot; for both mother and child to strengthen the spleen and stomach, gradually solidifying energy and blood so that the skull naturally closes.</p>
<p>For heat in the marrow, it is recommended to take Tongsheng Powder in pill form, avoiding nitrate; external application of the sealing method on the head may also help, or using a soft cloth to tightly bind it. Covering with a cloth for an extended period can also lead to a good outcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, some children have heads that grow larger after birth, with red scalp and small eyes; this is known as &quot;brain sore.&quot; It results from the heat and toxic energy of the parents contained in the kidneys, which then rises to the brain, causing the head to enlarge and become red. Such conditions are difficult to treat and typically do not extend beyond eighteen years. If the child, before turning one, develops sores and crusts all over the head, experiencing itchiness and pain, leading to inconsolable crying day and night, this too is hard to manage. It is advisable to administer the previously mentioned &quot;苦参丸&quot; (Bitter Herb Pills) and apply &quot;松皮散&quot; (Pine Bark Powder).<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Swelling and Depression of the Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>The prescription for swelling and depression of the fontanel states: &quot;Excessive heat causes swelling, while deficient heat causes depression.&quot; Swelling at the fontanel means the bone protrudes and swells upward. The classics say: &quot;Excessive heat causes swelling, due to the evil fire rising, causing the clear and bright qi to rise without descending.&quot; There are two signs: if the swelling is firm to the touch, this means there is a cold evil on the surface, closing the pores, preventing cold and heat from escaping, which is what is meant by &quot;qi rushing up causes firmness.&quot; In this case, one should use the Rising Yang Disperse Fire Decoction; this will resolve the stagnation. If the swelling feels soft and floating upon touch, this indicates accumulated heat within, steaming upward, referred to as &quot;qi rushing up causes softness.&quot; The use of a medicinal pill made of alcohol and Xuanwu should be employed to suppress this condition. When an outbreak occurs, the illness will stop immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Scalp Sores</strong></p>
<p>For sores on the scalp, do not allow them to become ulcers due to skin breakdown, resulting in pus that does not dry, with hair stuck together and lice breeding within. Scratching due to itching will lead to chronic conditions, resulting in leprosy. First, eliminate the lice by washing with a decoction of Acorus calamus, which will kill all the lice; let it dry, then mix mercury and fine powder in a bowl, grinding them together, and adding some saliva to moisten. Use your finger to dab the medicine onto the sores and within the hair. Once the lice are removed, apply a suitable amount of smoke from the autumn cowhide mixture with rosin, ground into a fine powder, and mixed with a little light powder and realgar, then heated and applied to the affected areas. For soft sores on the scalp that do not heal over time, applying the Purple Gold Pill will be effective.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Delayed Hair Growth</strong></p>
<p>The presence of hair on the head is like the presence of grass and trees on a mountain. Hair is an excess of blood, and its abundance or scarcity depends on the richness or depletion of blood. The hexagram of Kan represents blood; blood is the essence of the kidneys, and hair is a sprout of the kidneys, which is why it is black in color. If a child&#39;s hair does not grow for a long time or is not black when it does, this indicates kidney deficiency. It is advisable to use the Rehmannia Glutinosa Pill as treatment. After a serious illness, if the hair appears in tufts or is sparse, this indicates insufficient body fluids, resulting from malnourishment. It is recommended to use the Gathered Holy Powder as treatment.</p>

<p>A depressed fontanelle refers to the depression of the fontanelle creating a pit. There are two signs: the classics say that a depression indicates deficient energy. After a serious illness, when body fluids are insufficient, and true energy sinks down creating a pit, one should greatly replenish original energy and use the Regulate Original Decoction with Cimicifuga. If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to a reduced appetite, and as the spleen governs the muscles, when the flesh decreases and the skin becomes thin, the fontanelle may appear protruding, which is not a true depression. In this case, one should take the Fat Baby Pill or Ginseng and Poria Powder to nourish the spleen and stomach so that appetite returns, the muscles become balanced, and the fontanelle no longer protrudes.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Concerns Regarding Head Deformities and Neck Weakness</h3>
<p><strong>Head Deformities</strong></p>
<p>After a hundred days, if the head is flattened, the &quot;Book on Nurturing Young Hearts&quot; states that the condition is more serious than a skull indentation; this is a great void, and there is virtually no chance of survival. One must not see this as a disease but rather a failure of the parents. When a newborn’s skull is not fused, one should use a soft pillow made of mung beans and adjust it frequently; do not allow the head to rest on just one side, for then the skull will surely align properly. If after this the occipital bone is still sunk in, it is due to prolonged sleeping in one position. If it becomes difficult to nurture the child and the skull shows fractures and unevenness, it is not a sign of longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Neck Weakness</strong></p>
<p>If the head is tilted backward, it indicates a weak neck. The neck is the stem of the head, also known as the Heavenly Pillar Bone. A weak neck signifies that the Heavenly Pillar Bone cannot maintain the head, causing it to tilt forward, backward, or sideways—a serious condition. The symptoms can be twofold: if a newborn has a weak neck right from birth, it results from insufficient prenatal nourishment and weak kidney energy. The kidneys regulate the bones, while the liver regulates the tendons; when tendons don’t support the bones, fractures can occur, causing the mother to deplete the child&#39;s vitality. Such a child is difficult to nurture, rarely living beyond forty years. With kidney energy being weak, it is advisable to use Rehmannia Pills with added Angelica and Dipsacus for treatment. In cases where weakness arises after a severe illness, leading to an inability to hold up the head, it is a sign of deficient blood and energy, and one should take the Totally Restorative Decoction with honey pills. The texts state: the head is the dwelling of clarity and brightness. If the head is tilted or misaligned, the spirit will depart. Generally, individuals suffering from severe illness showing this symptom are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Kānyǎn (Malnutrition-related Eye Condition)</strong></p>
<p>This condition is often due to excessive consumption of rich and spicy foods, which accumulates heat and leads to the spleen and stomach being impaired. This causes the eyes to become red and watering, the pupils to develop spots, and eventually to appear white over time, necessitating prompt treatment; otherwise, it may result in chronic disease. Initially, administer a heat-clearing drink, and then follow with Wǔgān Wán (Five Malnutrition Pills).</p>
<p><strong>Jiělú (Head Unclosed Condition)</strong></p>
<p>Zhongyang states that the condition of the head being unclosed at birth is due to insufficient kidney energy, which affects the formation of the head, leading to a tendency towards smiling less. Additionally, if the whites of the eyes are prominent and the body is thin, it indicates a disposition towards worry and little joy. I have observed this in cases of kidney deficiency. Yang states: for older infants whose cranial sutures remain open and unjoined, the kidneys govern the marrow, and the brain is considered the sea of marrow; when kidney energy is lacking, the brain and marrow are insufficient, resulting in the inability of the skull to close. A person deficient in brain marrow is like a tree without roots; generally, those with this condition will not survive long. In some cases, it takes several years to become incapacitated. If this condition is present, one should not remain passive; it is advisable to use Qiánshì Dìhuáng Wán (Qian&#39;s Rehmannia Pills) and also to prepare a fine powder of Nánxīng (Arisaema), mix it with rice vinegar, and apply it heated on scarlet silk, which is also an effective method. Applying Baiziren San (Platycladus Seed Powder) or Sanxin San (Three Aromatic Powder) is particularly excellent.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yuan Xian and Yuan Tian</strong></p>
<p>Yuan Xian refers to the condition where the top of the head sinks. It is primarily caused by internal heat in the organs, leading to thirst and excessive drinking. This, in turn, results in diarrhea, and over time, the blood and energy become weak, unable to nourish the brain marrow. Hence, the top of the head sinks like a pit, not appearing full. To treat this, bone powder from a dog’s skull, roasted to a yellow powder, is mixed with chicken egg white and applied.</p>
<p>Yuan Tian refers to swelling or protrusion at the top of the head. The spleen governs the muscles, and irregularities in nourishment—be it overfeeding or underfeeding, hot or cold—can lead to imbalances in the internal organs. This causes energy to surge upwards, leading to swelling and protrusion of the head, which appears raised like a pile. When cold energy surges, it is hard and firm, while when hot energy surges, it is soft. If it is cold, apply warmth; if hot, apply cooling. The treatment dosage should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>For children, if liver energy is excessive, or when wind-heat attacks, the condition may similarly arise. This condition is not easily resolved. For heat symptoms, use a large Lianqiao powder to dispel it; if it’s a surface heat symptom, use Chaihu powder. There is also Fengyuan powder to cover it. </p>
<p>According to the theory, if a child’s stomach energy is balanced, the brain marrow will be full and the top of the head will gradually flatten. If the stomach is heated, it steams the internal organs, causing thirst and leading to diarrhea, which blocks heat in the organs. This weakens the blood and energy, hence the top of the head sinks. The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; recommends using Danggui powder and Dihuang pills for treatment.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Ear Disease</h3>
<p>The ear is a manifestation of the kidney. In children, when the kidney energy is abundant, the heat rises and impacts the ear, causing fluids to stagnate and transform into pus or other substances. Additionally, when water from bathing enters the ear, the humidity stays and interacts with the blood energy, brewing heat, which can also cause ear pus. If it persists without healing, it may eventually lead to deafness. Long Gu San is indicated for this condition. </p>
<p>Moreover, the Tang family has identified five types of ear discharge. The first type, &quot;yellow pus ear,&quot; usually has yellow pus discharging; the second type, &quot;red pus ear,&quot; typically has red pus; the third type, &quot;white pus ear,&quot; consistently has white pus; the fourth type, &quot;foul ear,&quot; has a stinky discharge from within; and the fifth type, &quot;hollow ear,&quot; presents with a hollow, ringing sound and sometimes discharges clear pus. However, all five conditions stem from the same source: wind and water entering the ear, leading to internal accumulation of heat. If not treated promptly, it may result in deafness. Treatments such as Yan Zhi Gao and others, along with medications to resolve phlegm and reduce heat, can result in recovery.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Illness</strong></p>
<p>For infants, on the third day, fifth day, sixth morning, or in the middle of a month, if they suddenly have nasal congestion and cannot suckle or breathe through the mouth, this often occurs when the wet nurse is asleep, and the exhalation from her nose blows onto the child. Alternatively, washing with water, whether warm or cold, without avoiding wind and cold can cause nasal congestion in the child. It is advisable to apply a nasal opening ointment and use dispersing medicine. If there are signs of fright and heat, peppermint powder can be taken, which is also good for the living.</p>
<p>There is also nosebleed, which occurs when heat attacks the qi and affects the blood. The lungs control the skin and hair of the entire body, and the mouth opens the cavities to the nose. If cold first enters the skin and then attacks the qi forming heat, this heat then affects the blood. When the blood becomes heated and behaves erratically, it releases from the nose, which is called a nosebleed. If sweating does not occur and dryness and wheezing in the nose persist, it can lead to a nosebleed. Treatment methods follow traditional formulas and adjust dosages slightly. Huangqin Decoction and Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction are the main treatments. Boiled fresh Rehmannia and reed roots are especially effective. For nosebleeds, Huangqin Decoction is the main treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Infant Care</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones. When kidney energy is sufficient, the brain&#39;s marrow fills, and the fontanel closes early; the bones and vessels flourish, and teeth emerge early. When kidney energy is weak, the brain&#39;s marrow is deficient, and the fontanel does not close. This occurs due to insufficient essence and blood from the parents, and it is advisable to use Rehmannia Pills for supplementation. If the child is still nursing, the mother should also supplement to harmonize and nourish the spleen and kidneys. Additionally, this condition may arise from inherent weakness in kidney energy and improper nursing, leading to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, which would also require the use of the Qi-Increasing Decoction. In cases of diarrhea with weak qi and blood, where the spleen and stomach cannot provide nourishment, the same approach applies. If the hands and feet are cold, add ginger and cinnamon to the previous decoction; if there is no response, indicating severe cold deficiency, urgently add Aconite. Delays may lead to irreparable consequences.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ear Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The ear is the aperture of the heart and kidneys, and it corresponds to the liver and gallbladder. The heart and kidneys govern internal Essence and blood deficiency, while the liver and gallbladder are associated with external conditions of excess wind and heat. Conditions such as deafness or tinnitus are due to congenital deficiency; whereas symptoms like fullness, pain, or itch with pus are caused by pathogenic factors. For congenital insufficiency, one should use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For excess wind-heat in the liver channel, Cha Hu Qing Gan San is recommended. If due to blood dryness, Zhi Zi Qing Gan San should be used; if ineffective, it can be supplemented with Liu Wei Wan and intermittently combined with Jiu Wei Lu Huo Wan. If caused by kidney and liver heat, Liu Wei Wan should be taken in the morning, and Lu Huo Wan in the evening. For food accumulation leading to internal heat, Si Wei Fei Er Wan is indicated. If it is caused by excess heat from food consumed by a nursing mother, Jia Wei Qing Wei San should be added. If due to spleen stagnation, add Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang. If anger heat in the liver channel is the cause, Jia Wei Xiao Yao San is appropriate. All the above should be taken by the nursing mother, with a small amount given to the child. One should not focus solely on treating the external symptoms, as this can also block the ear channel, leading to other disorders, prolonged retention leading to lifelong deafness. Be cautious!<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vision Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The scripture states: The eyes are the essence of the five organs and six bowels, constantly nourished by the spirit and soul. They are the main control of the spirit and qi. It is also said that all channels are connected to the eyes; the eyes obtain blood to see. The essence and qi from the five organs and six bowels flow upward to nourish the eyes. Therefore, the white part of the eye corresponds to the lungs, the black part to the liver, the pupil to the kidneys, the upper and lower eyelids to the spleen, the inner canthus to the heart, and the outer canthus to the bladder. Each of the five organs corresponds to a color, each having its own functions. The heart governs red; if red is excessive, it indicates heart fire, treated with a dispersing formula for red. If red is slight, it indicates heart deficiency heat, treated with a nourishing formula containing rhinoceros horn. The liver governs green; if green is excessive, it indicates liver heat, treated with a cooling formula for green. If it is pale green, it indicates liver deficiency, treated with a formula of Rehmannia. The spleen governs yellow; if yellow is excessive, it indicates spleen heat, treated with a cooling formula for yellow. If it is pale yellow, it indicates spleen deficiency, treated with a replenishing formula. If the eyes lack brightness and the white part is dark with little clarity, it indicates deficiency of both liver and kidneys, treated with a formula of Rehmannia combined with deer antler. If vision is clear by day but lost by night, it results from weakened yang qi, and in the presence of strong yin at night, the yang weakens further, resulting in inability to see, treated with a harmonizing and stomach nourishing decoction. If there are red channels with opacities moving from top to bottom, it belongs to the Foot Taiyang channel, treated with Dongyuan&#39;s selected extraordinary decoction; if moving from bottom to top, it belongs to the Foot Yangming channel, treated with a formula for regulating qi. The opacity membranes indicate internal wind-heat. If the pathogenic qi is unsettled, it is called hot opacity and floats on the surface; if the pathogenic qi is settled, it is called water opacity and sinks within; if the pathogenic qi is deep, it is called trapped opacity. It is advisable to use medicines that uplift and dispel the opacity.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

For cataracts, this is caused by the upward surge of liver fire and damp heat, with deficiency in the spleen failing to raise clear qi, leading to white spots, inability to open the eyelids, and tears that resemble paste, which over time can produce pus and damage the eyes. One should use the Remedies to Enhance Qi and Brighten Vision, the Poria Decoction to Drain Dampness, and the Four Flavor Fattening Pills. If the eyes cannot open, it may be due to irregular intake of dairy and food, or excessive consumption of cold medicines, causing the yang qi to sink and failing to rise, hence the inability to open the eyes; this requires the Bupleurum Decoction to Restore Life. If there is deficiency in stomach qi, and the eyelashes lack strength, causing an inability to open, one should use the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Augment Qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nasal Congestion and Nosebleed</p>
<p>The Physician Chao stated: The nose is the opening of the lungs, and the skin and pores are primarily linked to the lungs. When wind pathogens invade the lungs, causing nasal congestion and obstruction, one should use Xiaofeng San (Wind-dispelling Powder) or take seven green onion stalks, mix them with a small amount of oily powder, pound them, and then apply to the Yinzhen (the area between the eyebrows) while keeping it warm in the palm. If there is a nosebleed due to panic causing the qi to scatter and the blood to lose its restraint, one should use Yigong San (Special Efficacy Powder) combined with Chaihu (Bupleurum) and Shan Zhi Zi (Gardenia fruit). If the left side of the face is both blue and red, one should first use Chaihu Qinggan San (Bupleurum Liver-clearing Powder) and then take Dihuang Wan (Rehmannia Pill). If the right side of the face is red, it indicates heat in the lungs and large intestine, so one should use Xiebai San (White-draining Powder). If the nose is red, it indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, which requires Xiehuang San (Yellow-draining Powder). If slightly red, it indicates deficiency heat in the spleen channel, necessitating Yigong San with additional Shengma (Cimicifuga) and Chaihu. If the color is deep yellow, use Jisheng Xiang Di Huang Tang (Life-sustaining Rehmannia Decoction) followed by Yang&#39;s Dihuang Wan. If pale white, use Liu Junzi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction). If there is redness between the chin, use Siwu Tang (Four Substance Decoction) with Shan Zhi Zi; if severe redness, apply Wuma San (Five-Sesame Powder). If the urine is reddish, use Liuwei Wan (Six-Flavor Pill) or Buzhong Yiqi Tang (Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction). If the lips are white, use Liu Junzi Tang; if it hasn’t healed for a long time, use Maimendong Yin (Ophiopogon Decoction). </p>
<p>If the illness is recent and the original qi is not depleted, with normal intake of food, fever, strong heat, constipation, thirst for water, and sleeping with open eyes, this indicates that both the form and sickness are solid and treatment should focus on expelling the pathogen. If the illness has lasted a long time and the original qi is depleted, with reduced appetite, fever, dry mouth, drinking soup, vomiting, diarrhea, cold sensitivity in the limbs, and sleeping with open eyes, this indicates that both the form and sickness are deficient and the main focus should be on replenishing the righteous qi.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Sutra on the Fontanel&quot; states: If the fontanel has not closed, the sinews and bones will be soft and weak. If the fontanel shows blue veins, it signifies a weak and un-nourished pulse. If the fontanel is constantly sunken, it leads to frequent diarrhea. If the fontanel is protruding, wind diseases will not cease. If the fontanel remains cold for a long time, it causes clear vomiting and diarrhea. If the fontanel is soft and slack, seizures from dizziness are unavoidable. If the fontanel is flat and depressed, diarrhea may easily occur. If the fontanel is elongated, it predisposes to death from wind. If the fontanel connects with the forehead, it is easy to be startled into convulsions. If the fontanel is incomplete, there will be fear of heat and aversion to cold. If the fontanel closes slowly, the prenatal energy may be inadequate. If the fontanel has frequent movements, it indicates confusion of the spirit and weakness of energy. If the fontanel is wide, it leads to numerous illnesses and suffering. The fontanel is the gateway of the spirit and the key to the pathways of the body. It connects the upper and lower regions and links all important points. The seven orifices should be open, as are those of the five organs. The palace of the mud ball is the cavity of the soul and spirit. When energy is strong, it is closed; when energy is weak, it is open. This is due to growth; closure cannot be neglected.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Principles [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case of Scalp Deformity</strong></p>
<p>When paternal essence is insufficient, there will be a deformity of the scalp, and the whites of the eyes will be prominent. A scalp deformity suggests the absence of brain marrow, like a tree without roots. Though the ancients had good remedies, they would prove ineffective after much effort. However, one should not wait idly; it is advisable to rely on the Qian family&#39;s kidney-tonifying methods, in case there is any principle by which life can be sustained. The Qian family&#39;s Ginseng and Rehmannia Pill combined with deer antler is an example. Zeng says: Those who exhibit these signs, within a thousand days, may sometimes endure for a few years. An illness could suddenly worsen, resulting in severe disability. If the complexion is clear and the person can consume food, taking items like the Regulating Yuan Powder or Reinforcing Kidney Rehmannia Pills will show significant effects within ten days. Adjusting the treatment gradually may yield a cure. If treatment yields no change, healing will be difficult.</p>
<p>Tian states: For scalp deformity treatment, it is advisable to use Fresh Rehmannia Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Case of Sunken Fontanel</strong></p>
<p>Zeng states: A sunken fontanel represents extreme deficiency. When the stomach&#39;s energy is deficient and cold, it leads to this condition, which may be associated with chronic fright. If one experiences stomach cold combined with spleen burden, leading to vomiting and diarrhea, this indicates extreme deficiency. One should promptly utilize Golden Elixir Pill, Gu Zhen Decoction, and other reviving medicines, externally applying black adhesive plaster. For those with sinking at the back of the head, the symptoms are particularly severe. The treatment methods are the same as those for a sunken fontanel. If there is no effectiveness, healing will be difficult. This indicates extreme deficiency, with almost no possibility of survival.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Herniation</strong></p>
<p>The evidence of herniation can arise from an accumulation under the child&#39;s ribs, causing cough and crying, with the breath rising in reverse; if the crying persists for a long time and the breath has not settled, it is due to nursing; conditions of excess liver qi and ascent of wind-heat can also cause herniation. One must investigate each cause and treat accordingly. For those with cold, warm them; for those with heat, cool them. For reversed breath, harmonize and bring it down; for excess liver qi, use draining techniques primarily. In cases of heat, the formula Da Lian Qiao Tang is often used, while for exterior conditions, Xiao Feng San is recommended; for deficient cases, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang followed by Di Huang Wan. One must understand and clarify, as it resides within each person, and words cannot fully express intent. </p>
<p>The Zeng family states: people in the world often think of swelling as solely a heat issue, but little do they know, there are both yin and yang conditions that should be carefully distinguished. Hardness signifies yin while redness and softness signify yang, hence the &quot;Children&#39;s Treasure Book&quot; states: if cold qi ascends, it becomes firm; if heat qi ascends, it becomes soft. This is precisely what is meant. For yin conditions, manage with Yun Qi San or Li Zhong Tang; for yang conditions, use Yu Lu Yin, Dang Gui San, or Fang Feng Tang for treatment. </p>
<p>The &quot;Shi Bi Jing&quot; verse states: &quot;Accumulated heat in the spleen not flowing leads to a red face and lips. Chest tightness and nighttime coughing bring about filling and swelling; do not allow it to spread, provoking wind in the lungs.&quot;<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When sounds are made in the throat and phlegm accumulates, the fontanel swells and heat rises. If only the cooling of the diaphragm can soothe the spirit, it will lead to quick results. Both heat and cold can cause swelling. Cold leads to white stools or a sour, foul smell that assaults the senses, sometimes with worms emerging, as food cannot be digested, resulting in abdominal bloating and discomfort, with rumbling in the throat. Heat causes excessive thirst, results in red stools, presents with a yellowish complexion, bad breath, and also leads to worms emerging. Each condition should be treated according to its symptoms, while also requiring the removal of accumulated food and the regulation of qi. Cold indicates the need to warm the spleen and stomach, while heat needs to be dealt with to transform phlegm and stop thirst. When the fontanel is sunken, it indicates cold; when swollen, it indicates heat. Accumulated heat and a poorly-formed sunken fontanel suggest that the thirty-six types of damp-clearing powder should be used, along with a concentrated decoction of mulberry bark. </p>
<p>The &quot;Theory of Physical Symptoms&quot; states: Lung heat causes wind-phlegm and fontanel swelling; administering a dose of white cloves syrup or a few doses of nandina pills will alleviate the condition. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essential Guide to Strategies&quot; suggests: Whenever infants show swelling in the fontanel within the first month after birth, this is due to the heat energy received during gestation. Apply Huangbo ointment to the Yongquan acupoint on the soles of their feet. If it is sunken, use Banxia ointment on the palms. This indicates that the infant&#39;s kidneys are affected by cold qi, disrupting the heart and resulting in illness. Both Huangbo and Banxia are in powdered form, to be mixed with cold water for application.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Inversion of the Celestial Pillar</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wang states: The child has long suffered from malnutrition, being weak in body and not consuming food and drink for an extended period. As the condition worsens, the symptoms recede, leading to the inversion of the celestial pillar bone. The physicians do not recognize this and label it as the five soft conditions. One must administer Jinling San and Shengjin San. </p>
<p>Song from &quot;Treatise on Symptoms&quot;: The celestial pillar being inverted is difficult to treat, as this illness is neither of the heart nor the spleen. If one is afflicted, one must first consider vomiting or diarrhea; otherwise, the vital energy becomes depleted. Significant concerns arise with cold damage and the absence of a pulse; as mentioned in the &quot;Feng Sui Jing&quot;: one is then affected by cold damage with no floating pulse. </p>
<p>Appropriate medicine must be used to treat this condition; without a sudden onset of this ailment, one also cannot discern the nuances of the limbs being robust. If the body feels weak and the head is heavy, the face is flushed, lips reddened, the disease often arises from kidney heat, which later leads to residual heat illnesses. </p>
<p>The two verses in the &quot;Feng Sui Jing&quot; say: This ailment should only arise from gallbladder heat, and later latent heat will follow. The liver endures the heat and wind as the celestial pillar inverts, hence cool herbs must be administered to stabilize the condition. </p>
<p>It is essential to use warm medicinal herbs to alleviate it; immediate relief will be seen, so do not doubt. With vomiting or diarrhea, one must only regulate the vital energy; in cases of cold damage with the pillar inversion, no medical treatment is necessary. </p>
<p>This may relate to cold damage or be due to vomiting or diarrhea; the evil toxins penetrate the liver&#39;s channel, and the hot evil invades, resulting in weakened sinews. This may cause hands and feet to soften and remain unraised, or the neck and shoulders to weaken, impeding movement. If previous symptoms are present, one must cool the diaphragm; if vomiting or diarrhea occurs, first regulate the stomach&#39;s energy, apply cool medicines for the liver and gallbladder. One must not use excessively hot treatments, as one may also fear excessive cold.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Scalp Sores</strong></p>
<p>Scalp sores in children are caused by the six yang energies being afflicted by toxins and heat, leading to sores on the head. If sores spread in patches on the scalp, often accompanied by dryness, itchiness, and sparse hair resembling white flakes, this is due to accumulated heat attacking upwards, known as &quot;bald sores.&quot; Although the sores appear on the head, people generally only know to apply external medicine for treatment, and even if cured within ten days or a month, the sores often recur. Why is that? It is because the head is the convergence point for all yang energies. According to the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; in the Five Elements theory, fire is said to rise up. Heat and toxins attacking upwards and the two yang energies scorching each other result in sores on the head. The treatment should focus on alleviating the accumulated heat and calming the heart&#39;s agitation. For chronic scalp sores in children, a remedy using the Feng Tong Sheng San mixed with wine can be employed, along with separately ground Da Huang to a fine powder. This should then be mixed with wine and dried to become a powder. Each dose should be one qian, boiled in water for consumption, taken four to five times a day. Improvement can be seen after around thirty applications.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>External Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>For children suffering from eye ailments, do not lightly use eye drops; the primary focus should be on internal medication to dispel the disease. Examine the red veins above and below, and treat according to the meridian.</p>
<p><strong>Variola Entering the Eye</strong></p>
<p>The poison of variola arises from the five viscera and six bowels, and when the poison is strong, the eyes are inevitably affected. The ancient teachings regarding eye protection are profound. If the sores are excessively out and the eyes weep constantly, this signifies liver heat. At this time, there are no visible sores in the eyes, but one should internally take medicine to purge liver fire. The variola in the eye often occurs after the facial rash is uneven. If sores enter the eye and form a cataract, do not use eye drops, as this could damage the eyes irreparably. After the variola subsides, if the eyes cannot be opened, this indicates liver heat leading to sensitivity to light; whether in bright or dim conditions, they may struggle to open. If the heart&#39;s heat encounters brightness, the eyes may close; if in darkness, they may open, creating what is known as photophobia, indicating residual heat in the heart and liver. </p>
<p>If the sore has not yet formed pus and the swelling recedes allowing the eyes to open, this indicates the sore has passed its critical period. Uneven skin recovery causing the eyes to remain closed indicates the sore is deteriorating. If the eyes jerk upwards, this signifies heart failure; if they fixate without movement, this indicates kidney failure; if tears flow without crying, this suggests liver failure; slight closure indicates energy depletion; blood in the pupils indicates fire overwhelming water, all of which are fatal signs. </p>
<p>For those weakened by the variola poison in the eyes, cooling agents are not advisable; one should wait until after the facial rash to treat.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p>Smallpox is the most severe of poisons, due to the accumulation of malevolent toxins since birth. In ancient times, it was called the &quot;Hundred-Year Sore,&quot; as it is something that no one can avoid throughout their century of life. Once it manifests, the pure and harmonious vital energy of the body&#39;s channels and meridians is disturbed, resulting in a significant depletion of the righteous qi, allowing evil influences to take hold, each manifesting as various diseases based on what has been transgressed. Moreover, the eye, which is the clearest and most pure, is connected to the liver and gallbladder. The liver and gallbladder are the repositories of purity, where good and evil cannot coexist. When one&#39;s body is exposed to impure evils, it leads to a loss of the source of nourishment for the eyes, making them susceptible to illness; this happens because individuals are unable to rescue themselves and instead inflict harm upon themselves.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some illnesses arise from excessive consumption of food when one is unwell, retaining too much warmth, mistakenly taking hot medications, or consuming too much sweet and sour food, leading to illness. Others may become ill after recovery from an ailment, due to deficiency, overeating spicy, dry, fatty foods, overexerting oneself with excessive visual strain or crying, and exposing oneself to wind, dust, smoke, and miasmas. There may be cases of internal symptoms causing blurred vision and tearing or external symptoms like red, inflamed star-like obstructions. Some may have residual pathogenic factors that lead to conditions like fat and yellow membranes, or corneal opacities, which can result in protruding eyes. Others may have milder saline manifestations like red threads or slight haziness that resolve on their own. The severity and nature of these conditions vary from person to person and should be treated based on the specific symptoms, as blindly adhering to one approach may cause adverse reactions. </p>
<p>After experiencing smallpox, a person may feel reborn, yet different from usual. If any discomfort persists, it could cause lifelong harm. Therefore, those in this field should exercise caution. Generally, treating conditions early makes recovery easier with fewer complications; if delayed, even if there are no significant changes, blood and energy may congeal, making even straightforward cases harder to remedy. People today often assume that visual disorders following smallpox cannot be treated. However, if the pupil and gaze are not affected, there may still be a chance for recovery, even after a long time. It’s only when blood has solidified and symptoms of obstruction have developed that treatment becomes infeasible. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Eye Worm</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Dragon Wood Treatise&quot;: To treat the outward obstruction of children&#39;s eye worms, this condition initially arises from sores in the head and mind, or from prolonged diarrhea, which can cause hidden swelling and pain, resulting in tears that are difficult to open. Heat energy accumulates in the diaphragm, and liver wind enters the eyes. When first affected by this condition, there is itching, rubbing the eyebrows, and biting the nails, leading to the formation of opacity, redness, swelling, pain, and tears that fail to open. The eyelids become hard and the white part of the eye is covered, causing sensitivity to light; they prefer to lie down with their face covered and dislike raising their heads. This ailment is not suitable for cauterization on the head and face, fearing damage to the eyes. Avoid applying ointments. It is advisable to take medication for dispelling the worms and for resolving opacity.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Sacred Benefits Treatise&quot;: The liver opens at the eyes, and the eyes are indicators of liver health. If children have internal worm energy, their bodies become thin and weak, and due to wind and heat engulfing the organs, the flow is obstructed and cannot circulate. This is often due to excessive milk and food intake, which creates phlegm obstruction in the chest. The evil heat rises to attack the eyes, causing brain heat and itchy eyes, leading to redness, ulceration, or opacities gradually covering the vision. If left untreated for long, it damages the eyes, hence being called eye worms.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Jade Formula,&quot; it is stated: For this condition, first cool and regulate the diaphragm, then address the liver, followed by cleansing; this approach is effective. It also indicates: This condition is due to liver heat in children, and it is necessary to use liver cleansing powder and apricot kernel ointment to cool the diaphragm and reduce heat. Additionally, for children&#39;s eye worms, if there are spots and sores entering the eyes, first administer remedies to alleviate the diaphragm&#39;s heat and cool the heart, followed by worm treatment.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Disease</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan said: In children, lung qi connects to the nose, and qi represents the yang. If this qi is harmed by wind-cold, it stagnates in the nose, leading to nasal congestion; cold qi prevents the fluids from being retained, resulting in excessive nasal discharge. If cold air lingers, purulent discharge accumulates, causing an inability to smell, which leads to a condition known as &quot;malodorous nose.&quot; If there is accompanying heat, the nose becomes dry. All these conditions impede the digestion of milk and food.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Yan Shan said: If a child has nasal congestion, it is advisable to apply Tongguan ointment and take dispersing medicine. The Tongguan ointment is made from white silkworms, pig&#39;s tooth soap, schizonepeta, cyperus, chuanxiong, and asarum, ground into powder, mixed with the white part of scallions, and applied to the forehead for efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states: Lung qi connects to the nose; if the internal organs are harmed by wind-cold, the cold follows the qi into the nose, preventing the retention of fluids, resulting in nasal discharge. Fluids like saliva and mucus, when exposed to heat, become dry; when exposed to cold, they overflow.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Nose with No Discharge</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states: When a child’s lungs are obstructed, with accumulated heat attacking upward towards the brain, it causes heat in the brain. Since lung qi connects to the nose and is responsible for mucus, if the organs are hot, the fluids become dry, leading to a lack of discharge.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Nasal Polyps</h3>
<p>The &quot;Qianjin Yi&quot; states: People often have flesh obstructing their noses, which affects their sleeping and eating. There are many folk remedies for nasal discharge, yet they are all ineffective. Only &quot;Bencao&quot; mentions that realgar is for nasal polyps, which is true. However, contemporaries do not know how to use realgar; when practitioners use it incorrectly, it leads to complications. There was once a person who could not breathe through the nose, and I processed realgar, approximately the size of a large jujube, and after ten days, the obstruction resolved, allowing for breathing to resume without recurrence. The method of processing realgar is mentioned in the &quot;Qianjin Yi&quot; in the elixir formulas, and it should be sought after.</p>
<h3>Hearing Loss</h3>
<p>Zhang Huan says: In children, ear diseases arise when wind enters the brain and stagnates in the hand&#39;s Taiyang meridian, causing hearing loss. When wind and dampness clash, sores appear in both ears. When a child grows a little older and sees the new moon and points at it, sores may appear beneath the ears, known as moon eclipse sores. When a wet nurse bathes a child and mistakenly allows water to enter the ears, the moisture accumulates, clashing with the blood and qi, forming pus, which is called otorrhea. The &quot;Baojian&quot; rhyme goes: &quot;When wind enters the ear, hearing is damaged; when qi is stagnant, hearing loss is certain. Ringing indicates that wind and qi clash, and pain suggests that there is evil wind in the brain. Heat in the kidneys steams and causes hearing issues; the pain deepens, producing thick pus. If there is no thick pus, it is not this illness, but rather due to water dripping inside.&quot;<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chao states: The evil qi collides with the right qi, resulting in tinnitus; if this persists, the evil qi becomes stagnant and eventually leads to deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Otitis</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: The ear is where the ancestral meridian converges and where the kidney qi flows. In children, if the kidneys are abundant and possess heat, this heat qi rushes upwards to the ear, causing fluids to become stagnated, leading to the production of pus. Also, if water enters the ear during bathing and is not thoroughly drained, the moisture may accumulate, interfere with the blood qi, and generate heat, resulting in pus as well. This condition is referred to as otitis. If it endures and does not heal, it may turn into deafness.</p>

<p><strong>Cranial Relief</strong></p>
<p>Cranial relief is primarily due to deficiency in the kidney system. In older children, if the head seams remain open and do not close properly, it is advisable to use kidney qi pills, or the Eight Treasure Formula combined with wine, cooked with rhizome and lotus. Externally, powdered nanshing and white lance can be mixed with vinegar, spread on red silk, heated, and applied. Alternatively, burning tiger skull bones into ash and mixing with oil can be applied to the seams, with a head covering for protection. Parents should take kidney qi pills and tiger tranquilizing pills to ensure sufficient essence and blood, preventing such issues in future offspring.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Swelling and Depression</strong></p>
<p>Wind-heat leads to head swelling and spleen deficiency. Head swelling occurs when liver qi is strong and wind-heat surges upward to create this condition. The &quot;Yuhuan Collection&quot; states: when the head gate swells, it is certainly due to wind, and this condition should be treated but is not serious. If it develops into a pit-like form, within seven days, life is surely at risk.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Lesion Opacity Obscuring Vision</strong></p>
<p>Hai Zang asserts: Dongyuan treats remaining wind-heat poison after spots, where the membrane blocks vision, using Qingshan Pills for great effect. &quot;Baoming Collection&quot; states: for removing the membrane, it is effective to not only reduce with Da Huang but also to treat the root cause. I believe that prolonged retention of wind-heat in the liver channel leads to the formation of the membrane, and Qingshan Pills are indeed used to address the root of the disease. For children whose rash aftermath leads to upward attack on the eyes, causing membrane swelling and pain, with a strong pulse and good appetite, use a modified version of the antelope horn powder to resolve it. For those with qi and blood deficiency and weak stomachs, it is essential to prioritize nourishment, supplemented with detoxification, to achieve success. Danxi stated: Xijiao powder disperses upward, more so than other horns, and is used for those with residual poison post-pox. If there is no residual poison, it leads to risks of weakness, which should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sparrow&#39;s Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>For young children, the condition of the fontanelle relates to the liver and spleen channels. If the spleen is weak, strengthen the spleen; if the liver is deficient, nourish the blood. These should be treated in two ways. The child’s diet and complexion may appear normal, but they cannot see at night, thus it is advisable to use restorative drinks.</p>
<p><strong>Cranial Relief</strong></p>
<p>In children, strong kidney energy results in the fontanelle being small and closed early; whereas weak kidney energy leads to an open fontanelle. If the fontanelle does not heal, the illness may attack repeatedly, making it extremely difficult to protect the child, which is a serious condition.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Swollen and Sunken Fontanelle</strong></p>
<p>All newborns have a fontanelle, as their internal energy is not yet full, their bone marrow is not complete, and nourishment is insufficient. Internal organs rely on the spleen and stomach for nourishment. After birth, when the child is fed with grains, their internal energy is replenished and bone marrow matures, leading to the closing of the fontanelle once they can eat. The fontanelle is connected to the spleen and stomach. The &quot;Seng Ji Jing&quot; states that the fontanelle is connected to earth, which corresponds to the spleen and stomach. If a child has a swollen fontanelle, it is due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, imbalance of hot and cold, angry crying when fed, or wheezing and coughing, leading to a reversal of Yin and Yang energy that causes the fontanelle to swell. It swells and feels soft with heat, and swells and feels hard with cold. A sunken fontanelle may result from diarrhea, frequent urination, past intake of cleansing medicines, inherent weak energy, or lingering other illnesses, all of which render the internal organs deficient and unable to nourish the fontanelle, hence causing it to sink. These are all severe conditions for children, and few manage to recover.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Various Head Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Soft boils that appear on a child&#39;s head are caused by the invasion of wind and cold, affecting the skin, lingering in the blood and qi, obstructing the meridians, and accumulating to form these boils, similar to those that arise on the body but located on the head. Initially, they appear red and swollen and hard; if the pathogen is mild, it may dissipate on its own. However, if the pathogen is severe, the swelling becomes red and painful, producing pus and blood. Due to the tightness of the scalp, it is often difficult to fully remove the pus when it becomes mature; there may be residual foul fluid that leads to recurrence or the emergence of new boils at the edges, resulting in continuous non-healing, often painfully abscessing, hence the name soft boils. </p>
<p>For children with bald patches on the head, according to the Nine Worms theory: this is caused by pinworms interacting with wind pathogens, affecting the skin of the head, colliding with the blood and qi, and injuring the nourishing and protective aspects. The nourishing aspect relates to blood; when diseased, it leads to red baldness; the protective aspect relates to qi; when diseased, it causes white baldness. As the nourishing aspect is internal, it is more difficult for pathogens to affect it, hence cases of red baldness are rare; meanwhile, as the protective aspect is external, pathogens can easily invade, leading to more cases of white baldness.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

Gradually, it forms crusts, leading to wounds that ultimately result in nearly complete hair loss. If the crusts are scraped off, the wounds are filled with holes of varying sizes. There is pus that oozes out, and while there is no pain, there is an unbearable itch, indicating the presence of a &quot;wind&quot; insect. There is also a condition commonly called &quot;ghost licking the head,&quot; where a child with a scalp sore is said to be licked by a ghost overnight, resulting in red crusts covering the head, sometimes referred to as &quot;red baldness.&quot;</p>
<p>The cause of a child&#39;s scalp sore is internal heat affecting the organs, which then rises to the head. Coupled with external wind and moisture, these factors combine, impacting the blood and qi, thereby leading to the sores, hence it is called scalp sores. This condition is distinct from bald sores. Bald sores can appear both white and red, with hard crusts covering the entire head. In contrast, scalp sores might only appear in one or two spots, lacking the whitish, hard, dry texture, often exuding pus and blood.

<p>When a child suddenly suffers from deafness or diminished hearing, it is due to the invasion of wind pathogens affecting the Hand Taiyang channel. The pathogen follows this channel and enters the ear; when the pathogen clashes with the correct energy, it causes stagnation and blockage, resulting in deafness and inability to hear sounds.

<p>If a child experiences ringing or pain in the ears, it is due to the invasion of wind evil into the ears, which interferes with vital energy. If it collides with blood and qi, it results in ringing; if it affects the meridians, it leads to pain.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Swelling and Pus</strong></p>
<p>If a child has swelling or sores in the ears producing pus, it results from a combination of wind and dampness entering the ears, affecting the opposition between evil and vital energy, colliding with qi and blood, and damaging the meridians. If mild, it causes swelling; if severe, sores may develop. If bodily fluids accumulate and break down, pus and blood may emerge. Additionally, if water or tears enter the ears, obstructing vital energy, this too can lead to pus, commonly referred to as &quot;tinnitus&quot; or &quot;purulent ear.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eye Diseases Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When a child has eye diseases, it is often due to excessive consumption of sweet and sour foods, generating internal heat and affecting the liver meridian, which manifests in the eyes. This may lead to redness, swelling, itching, or pain; excessive tearing; the presence of red veins; or the formation of membranes. If phlegm, dampness, and toxic qi invade the liver, causing its energy to become obstructed, then clarity is not achieved; hence, even if the pupils are intact, vision may be impaired, a condition termed &quot;dimming vision.&quot; If one cannot see during the day, it is considered an evil affecting the yin of the meridians, known as &quot;night blindness,&quot; akin to a bird that cannot see in the dark.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Nasal Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The lung qi communicates with the nose. If the qi is not harmonized, it can be invaded by wind and cold, becoming stagnant in the nose, obstructing the fluids and causing mucus to congeal, resulting in blocked nasal passages, which is termed nasal obstruction. If wind and cold obstruct the blood qi, causing the formation of flesh-like obstructions, it is called nasal polyp. If wind and dampness interact, sores and purulent discharge may develop in the nose. If heat from the brain attacks the nose leading to dryness, or if sores and scabs form, they may be hard and devoid of purulent discharge.<br>— From the &quot;Young and Young Near Compilation&quot; by Chen Zhi (Ming Dynasty) </p>
<p><strong>Nasal Collapse</strong></p>
<p>Nasal collapse occurs due to deficiency of kidney qi, leading to insufficient brain marrow, with damp heat ascending, causing the cranial sutures to separate and not align.

The &quot;Expanded Meaning&quot; suggests treating nasal collapse with crab claws mixed with Rhizoma Bletillae, ground into a paste and applied to the crown.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Depression</strong></p>
<p>Nasal depression occurs when qi and blood are both deficient and the original qi sinks. It is suitable to use the Middle-Qi Boosting Decoction; if the hands and feet are cold, add ginger, cassia, and even prepared aconite.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Filling</strong></p>
<p>Nasal filling occurs due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach leading to a reversal of qi that ascends. There may also be spleen-stomach heat or damp heat present. In these cases, it is advisable to use Yigong San with fried Baizhu, Mu Xiang, and Viticis Fructus.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dongyuan Buyang Decoction</strong> is used to treat conditions in which yang cannot overcome yin, leading to an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang. This imbalance results in obstruction of the nine orifices, causing blue and white cataracts to appear at the corners of the eyes. The yin obstructs the flow of yang from the foot Taiyang and Shaoyin meridians, preventing it from ascending to the eyes, hence the internal blockage of blue cataracts. It is important to supplement the yang first and then drain the fire of the foot Jueyin from the foot Taiyin meridian, rooted in the yang. </p>
<p>The <em>Neijing</em> states: When yin is excessive and yang is deficient, one should first supplement yang and then drain yin. Take Shengyang Decoction on an empty stomach daily, and before bed, take a draining yin pill. Anticipate adjustments and nurturing of the body’s energy, maintaining equilibrium of body energy and clarity of external conditions while taking this decoction. This will help to supplement yang, allowing it to rise and flow to the end of the liver meridian, thus benefiting the open orifices of the eyes.</p>
<p>The ingredients include: Qianghuo, Duhuo, Danggui (washed and dried in wine), Licorice stalks, Shudihuang, Ren Shen, Huangqi, Baizhu, each one tael; Zexie and Ju Hong, each half a tael; Shengdi, Bai Fu Ling, and Zhimu, each three qian; Chaihu two taels; Fangfeng and Baishao, each five qian; and Rougui one qian. </p>

<p>Also: Use gypsum as a fine powder. Each time, take one cent, slice a piece of pig liver thinly, put the medicine inside, bind it with hemp thread, put it in a sand jar, and cook it until done. Cut into pieces and eat. This method works like a charm for those who have tried other medications without success.</p>
<p><strong>For Children&#39;s Eye Malnutrition:</strong><br>Take equal parts of black bass fish bones and oysters, grind them into a fine powder, and form into round pills the size of soap. Use one pill at a time, and together with a piece of pig liver, add the medicine into clear rice water and cook until the liver is done to the right degree, then consume the liver along with the juice.</p>

<p>The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: for children with an inwardly sunken fontanel, cauterize half an inch above and below the navel, as well as the tip of the tailbone; also perform one moxibustion on each foot&#39;s Taiyin point. The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: if the fontanel is not closed, moxibustion should be applied to the points half an inch above and below the navel with three applications, cauterizing before sores develop. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: for children with a sunken fontanel, perform moxibustion on the Shuifen point seven times, and avoid acupuncture. The Shuifen point is located one inch below the xiphoid process and one inch above the navel, corresponding to the lower orifice of the small intestine. This is responsible for separating clarity from turbidity; fluids enter the bladder, waste into the large intestine, hence the term &#39;water division.&#39; Alternatively, if using acupuncture, a length of three-tenths can be applied, and five moxibustions are then needed. Changqiang is also named Qizhi Yinque and Juegu, located at the tip of the sacral spine, measured at three-tenths; it must be accessed by lying prone.

<p>Another child had a cranial deformity and was not yet one year old. He could recognize characters and read, and his parents were very fond of him.

I fear this will worry the parents. He passed away before reaching one year, having experienced convulsions.</p>
<p>A third child had four sutures open on the head, with a smooth and tight scalp, and very small eyes. I said: The brain is the sea of marrow. The kidneys govern the bones; with hidden fire in the marrow, it becomes hot, leading to a fractured skull. A large forehead and small eyes are the result.

I continued with the previous medicine, and after another month, his appetite slightly increased, and the heat had significantly diminished. I began using the Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction in the morning and the Eight Ingredients Pill before meals; after another month, his vitality gradually recovered, and his appetite returned to normal. After another month, his muscles strengthened, and all illnesses were resolved.</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old child, after malaria, had a soft neck, cold hands and feet, and little appetite. If he ate porridge or soup slightly removed from the fire, he felt cold in his abdomen. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added cinnamon and dried ginger, and his appetite gradually improved; I added anise and pepper to his food. After a month, he could eat porridge slightly off the fire: I also used the previous medicine for a hundred doses, and his appetite was normal, with warm hands and feet. After another month, he could lift his head. Later, his appetite stagnated, and he experienced vomiting and diarrhea, still with a weak neck. In the morning, I used the Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added or reduced Eight Ingredients Pill. After more than two months, he could lift his head again. After a marriage, his vision became blurry, his neck bones felt weak, and his head felt heavy. I used the Eight Ingredients Pill and the Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction, and after more than three months, his vitality was restored, and all symptoms receded. After each exertion in the bedroom, he felt extraordinarily fatigued with night sweats and heat; after taking the two medicines, he recovered.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

A large dose of the two medicines was prepared and brewed like tea for unrestricted drinking. After more than two months, the thirst and fever decreased, and after a year, the head symptoms resolved. After another year, the limbs became stronger. If not for careful management of the illness, even this medicine would not have helped.</p>
<p>In Xue&#39;s &quot;External Medicine Heart Method,&quot; it is stated that a child suffering from white sores on the head has smooth skin and a quick onset; none of the medicines worked. This condition is called brain sores, caused by fetal toxins combined with wind-heat. Treatment involves taking Longdan pills and blowing aloe vera powder into the nose, along with applying detoxifying powder, resulting in recovery. In severe cases, if the sores are lumped like ears, with brain heat akin to fire, profuse sweating, swollen jaw, and elevated chest, this medicine should be taken.</p>
<p>A young child had several sores on the head and face, causing itching and oozing fluid, resulting in sores wherever the fluid spread—this is called yellow water sores. Treatment involved a powder of soybean and rosin, mixed with fragrant oil for application, while also drinking a detoxifying powder, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had several itching sores on the head and face, with scabs accumulating, known as sticky sores. Treatment involved an equal mixture of dried white alum and yellow cinnabar powder, applied with sesame oil, coupled with drinking a detoxifying powder for recovery.</p>

<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A young child from the Huang family had a red swollen face and couldn’t open his eyes. A person used a (Jinfei) needle to lightly pierce and drain the area; apart from the eyes, dozens of needles were pricked randomly, causing blood to flow three times, and then it healed. Many people are unwilling to follow this method, insisting on treating the illness while being overly cautious!</p>
<p>A young child had red eyes, and his mother bought malachite to wash his eyes. Boiling it, the family mistakenly allowed the child to drink it, leading to severe vomiting, and after vomiting, his condition immediately improved.</p>
<p>A boy from the Wang family in Qingzhou was over ten years old and had red eyes with excessive tears; various treatments were ineffective. A person observed and said: This child’s eye disease stems from being frightened in his mother’s womb. The father replied: During pregnancy, we were surrounded in Linqing. The person instructed to administer Guati powder with added Yujin, promoting upward flow and resulting in a significant discharge of saliva. Everyone laughed at this. The mother also said: There’s no illness in the child’s belly, so why such vomiting and diarrhea? By the next day, his eyes were bright and clear. Li Zhong&#39;an saw this and was astonished, saying: Remarkable! This method saves lives! That day, he also bled from the head, and blood came from both eyebrows and nostrils. During vomiting, a dose of Tongjing powder (two qian) and 72 pills of Zhouchuan Wan were used, leading to a significant reduction in vomit; another dose of Tongjing powder (one qian) was administered.

I noted that the hot feet and abnormal urination indicated kidney and liver deficiency, while the inconsistent bowels and coughing revealed spleen and lung weakness. In the morning, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and in the evening, I provided Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, gradually restoring his original energy. I then supplemented with Si Wei Fei Er Wan, and after over a month, he was cured.</p>
<p>A child complained of eye pain. When treated with fire-clearing medicines for the liver, it instead caused increased photophobia, redness, and nighttime anxiety along with crying. This condition was due to liver blood deficiency causing fiery movement that harmed the lungs. I used Wu Wei Yi Gong San with Shan Zhi to nourish the spleen and clear the lung heat. Additionally, I administered Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water, promote liver blood, and create stability; I also included Si Wei Fei Er Wan, leading to his full recovery.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

<p>A child with convulsions and eye ailments was affected by wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder channels. Initially, Chai Hu Qing Gan San was administered to address the liver, followed by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidney, resulting in improvement.</p>
<p>A child experienced eye pain and itchiness due to accumulated heat from rich foods, which caused thirst for cold drinks and constipation.

He took the Jinkui Shenqi Pill, which healed him temporarily, but the symptoms returned, leading to cataracts. He then used the Congming Yiqi Decoction combined with the previous pills, which cured him, but the issue recurred. He appeared emaciated, with a rapid and strong pulse. He took the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction along with the previous pills and was cured.</p>
<p>There was a child who experienced spasms due to fright, which caused eye twitching. Initially, he was treated with a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Wutong and Huanglian to clear liver heat. Then, he took the Dihuang Pill to nourish the kidney and support the liver, resulting in a cure.</p>
<p>Another child had conjunctivitis, with either redness or frequent wiping of the brow. This was due to wind-heat in the liver meridian, indicating the onset of liver sores. He was treated with the Siwei Fei&#39;er Pill by adding Gentian and achieved a cure.</p>
<p>A child presenting with excessive white in the eyes, vomiting phlegm, and convulsions was treated primarily with the Dihuang Pill, supplemented with the Yiping Pill to stop the convulsions. Later, using the widely known Dihuang Pill resulted in increased darkness in the pupils.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old girl experienced eye pain, occasional itching, headaches, or pain in both sides, sometimes accompanied by chills or fever, internal heat, thirst, and reduced appetite, suggesting deficiency of qi and blood in the liver and spleen with heat. She was treated with the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Chai Hu Qinggan Powder, which healed her. Subsequently, a lump formed above her left eyebrow, about the size of a bean, gradually enlarging to the size of a chestnut, becoming necrotic and painful.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A nine-year-old boy had an ongoing fear of brightness in his eyes, which had not improved over time. Some believed it was due to excess heat, and he was given laxatives like Qingwan, but it only worsened the condition. He sought treatment from me and still wanted to purge the liver. I suggested that since it was liver-related deficient heat, he should take Dihuang pills to replenish it, and he recovered. The liver&#39;s qi is yang and heat, while the liver&#39;s blood is yin and water. Liver conditions, unless caused by liver fire or blood dryness leading to wind, are typically due to deficient liver blood causing fire. In the case of an acute condition presenting with both sickness and a vigorous appearance, it is appropriate to use laxatives like Qingwan sparingly; for chronic cases with both sickness and weak appearance, Dihuang pills should be used to nourish the kidney and liver. The reason for this condition is often insufficient liver blood leading to the generation of wind, so harsh purgatives should not be used. The classic states that for weak diseases, one should nourish their source; for strong diseases, one should drain their offshoot. In a previous case where there was clear evidence of liver heat, treatments like Chaihu and Huanglian were suitable to address the heart&#39;s heat. The practitioner must be discerning.</p>
<p>A thirteen-year-old boy experienced prolonged eye pain, gradually developing a greenish film, and later became red and decayed. His left pulse was stringy and rapid. Treatment with Jiuwwei Luohui pills and an enhanced version of Xiaoyao powder led to recovery. After the illness recurred, Dihuang kidney essence pills were used as the main remedy, along with the modified Xiaoyao powder, resulting in health restoration.</p>
<p>A fifteen-year-old boy experienced red and painful eyes due to overexertion, along with fever and thirst; his pulse was large but weak. I prescribed Bazhen soup with a dose of fried black gardenia, which rapidly alleviated his symptoms. Subsequently, I used Buzhong Yiqi soup, leading to his recovery. Later, he experienced nocturnal emissions and his eye pain returned. I prescribed Liuwuwei Dihuang pills with additional ingredients, using five-flavor fruit for two doses, which stopped the pain. After approximately thirty more doses, his vision was restored.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child exhibited symptoms of a greenish hue in the eyes and was continuously crying and thrashing about. Treatment with Niu Huang Qing Xin Pills was ineffective, worsening the situation with teeth grinding and agitation, leading to bedwetting.

<p>Another child had convulsions and fixated eyes, indicating wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder channels. I first administered Chai Hu Qing Gan San to clear the liver, followed by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>In Wan&#39;s &quot;Pediatrics Expanded,&quot; it is noted: A four-year-old girl from the Wang family had a lump behind her ear, and they consulted me. I stated it was not a sore but rather a phlegm nodule, which required no treatment and posed no harm. Other doctors were misled, diagnosing it as a sore, and prescribed excessive medicine for removing it, which harmed the spleen and stomach, leading to malnutrition and death. How tragic! Horseflies often appear in front and behind the ears, causing swelling, stiffness, and red pain, commonly known as mumps; applying Bai Du San yields remarkable effects.</p>
<p>In Xue&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Baby Care,&quot; it is mentioned: A child had pus coming from the ear, foul-smelling and unapproachable, persisting for years, with thirst and hot feet, and possibly slightly darkened facial complexion. I diagnosed this as kidney malnutrition and prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. The mother was instructed to take Jia Wei Xiao Yao San for improvement. Later, due to separate treatment with liver-quelling medicines, the symptoms recurred: cold and heat, pale face, frequent urination. This indicated liver fire and dry blood; I used Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear the liver and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys, ultimately resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

Thus, in the morning, a modified Guipi Decoction was given, and in the evening, a modified Xiaoyao Powder was used; both mother and child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child, aged twelve, was naturally weak and thin, with pus and water coming from the ear, sometimes causing pain or itching. By the age of fourteen, after increased treatment, he displayed fever, fatigue, and weakness in the legs for eight years. A combination of the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pills slightly improved his condition. After marriage, he disregarded restrictions, leading to chills and fever, along with saliva and phlegm in his throat. I noted that kidney deficiency could not control water, leading to phlegm-like symptoms, while the clear energy could not rise, resulting in dizziness, and the Yang energy could not protect the skin, causing chills and fever. Therefore, I applied Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with a bit of Vitex and Aconite; after four doses with no response, I used one ounce of Ginseng and a bit of Aconite, and he responded after two doses. Subsequently, over a hundred doses of the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction were given, leading to full recovery. However, after excessive exertion in the bedroom, he experienced a hoarse throat and surging phlegm, with weakness in his legs; using Dihuang Yinzi immediately alleviated the symptoms, and I continued with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction for stability. Later, he experienced inappropriate daily routines, with morning chills and evening fevers, cold in the limbs, shortness of breath, and abundant phlegm, with a weak pulse. I administered Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction with a small amount of Aconite and a few doses led to improvement; I then removed the Aconite and used three drams of Ginseng for ongoing treatment, which resulted in stability.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A weak child has a penchant for eating soil, charcoal, and ashes. Later, he has trouble breathing through his nose, and after strictly taking cooling medicines, his body becomes even thinner, eats little, is warm to the touch, and is easily startled and irritable. His urine is delayed and turns white, and there are two-inch polyps in his nose. There is a small lump in the neck, hidden between the muscles. I believe this is a transformation due to deficiency in the liver and spleen. Not trusting this, they cleared internal lung fire and applied corrosives externally, resulting in throat corrosion. I initially used a modified Wumei Yigong Powder with Shengma, Chaihu, and Wutui as the main ingredients, supplemented with the Four-Flavor Fei&#39;Er Pill, which gradually strengthened the spleen&#39;s energy; in the evening, I used the Nine-Flavor Aloe Pill as the main treatment, supplemented with Wumei Yigong Powder, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child has difficulty urinating, a dry nose, and nosebleeds, with a red color in his nostrils; he has heat in the spleen and lungs. I used the Jisheng Xijiao Dihuang Decoction, and the previous condition was resolved. Later, the area below the chin remains red, thirst occurs, and there is phlegm, indicating insufficient kidney qi. I used the Dihuang Pill, and all conditions were healed.</p>
<p>Xue’s &quot;External Medicine Heart Method&quot; states that a child has sores on the outside of the nose, which, if not rubbed regularly, extend to both ears, and various drugs are ineffective. Using the Aloe Pill for oral intake and applying rosin and mung bean powder led to recovery.</p>
<p>A child has a cough with wheezing, high fever, chills, skin resembling millet, an itchy nose with a runny nose, a sore throat, rotten gums with blood, abdominal distension with a feeling of fullness, and diarrhea, named lung syphilis.

Such children generally tend to be more sorrowful than joyful; their sclerae are often too prominent, their faces pale and washed out, and their bodies lean, all indicative of kidney deficiency. (Note: The kidneys govern marrow, and the brain is considered the sea of marrow. The aforementioned condition arises when the parents' essence and blood are insufficient to nourish the child, and it is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to replenish them. If the child reaches seven or eight years old, or fourteen or fifteen years old, when Qi and blood are strong and the fontanelle naturally closes, they may be fine. However, if indulging in food and desires depletes true Yin, their lifespan cannot be fully realized. If this condition presents in infants, the mother should also be nourished, and the child's head should be tightly wrapped in soft cloth to facilitate closure. There may also be cases of recessed or filled fontanelles, both falling under insufficient constitution. Additionally, those suffering from lingering Five Taxations with depleted vital energy should also be monitored along with similar symptoms of urinary difficulty.)"},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"### Late Hair Growth If hair takes a long time to grow, and when it does, it is not black, it indicates weakness of the fetus. *Note: This is one of the five signs of late development. Hair is a manifestation of kidney vitality. This is mainly due to insufficient essence and blood from the parents, leading to weak kidney energy that cannot nourish the hair.* ### Sweet Sores In children, if sweet sores do not heal for a long time, they are commonly called “fragrant sores,” mainly appearing on the face and in front of the ears. One method is to have the mother chew white rice into a paste and apply it before sleeping; it should heal in three to five applications. Both the child and mother should avoid chicken, pork, fish, rabbit, wine, vinegar, and anything that induces heat and wind. The treatment for sweet fingers follows the same method. ### Facial Sores Facial sores in children are referred to as eyebrow sores; ear sores are called ear sores; and foot sores are known as shoe fungi. These three terms, when examined, are all misnomers. The classics say: all painful sores are related to heart heat, resulting from severe blood heat. Some say: The “Internal Classic” states that generally, heat should not be assumed to apply to all cases. This is a misunderstanding of the way of nature; care should be taken not to be misled. A gold needle may be used to prick for blood; if it does not heal after one attempt, it should be pricked again. If it still does not heal after the second attempt, it will surely heal after the third attempt. The “Internal Classic” states: Blood that is abundant should be pricked. Eyebrow sores should not be treated with medicine, as they are often itchy; scratching may occur, and if the medicine gets into the eyes, it will cause damage."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"**White Scalp** The condition known as white scalp in children is commonly referred to as chicken dung baldness. One can use sweet melon vines and dragon head; there is no specific quantity required. Soak them in river water overnight, then boil in a clay pot to extract the extremely bitter juice. After filtering out the melon vines, use low heat to reduce it to a syrupy consistency and store it in ceramic containers. Before application, shave the head to remove all scabs and dead blood, then cleanse with river water. Afterward, take a small cup of the prepared melon vine extract, add two qian of fresh pinellia powder, one tablespoon of natural ginger juice, and one piece of dog bile together to mix. A dosage of just three qian is sufficient. It is crucial to avoid chicken, pork, fish, rabbit, and any foods that induce heat or wind. **Eye Disorders** The \"Inner Canon\" states: \"When heat prevails, there is swelling.\" To treat fire, the method involves using salty and cool medicines; emesis and purging are also effective. For acupuncture, target Shen Ting, Shang Xing, Yin Hui, Qian Ding, and Bai Hui points. Conditions like blood cloudiness can be quickly alleviated; pain can be promptly relieved; obscured vision can be restored; and swelling can be diminished. However, acupuncture should not be performed on the Yin Hui point in children, as the flesh is too thin and may damage the bones. Children’s conditions are governed by the water above and fire below, hence clear vision. **Scabs in the Eye** If a child's scabs enter the eye, it is due to residual heat not dissipating. The appropriate course of action is to reduce heart fire, drain liver wind, and nourish kidney water, leading to recovery. **Malnutrition Eye** If a child's malnutrition-related eye condition does not improve for several days, it is caused by wind-heat from the liver. Administering Liang Ge San in several doses will aid in opening the eyes and promote healing."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"### Resolving Skull Issues Resolving skull issues occurs when the mother's energy is weak and there is an excess of heat. According to Dai Yun, for newborns whose skull bones have not yet fused and are open, it is advisable to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction and Four Substances Decoction, adding alcohol for heat, along with prepared cooked rhubarb, Scutellaria, roasted Coptis, and raw licorice, to be taken as a decoction. Externally, tie a silk cloth securely and apply a powder of white lanceolate. ### Head Sores For a child's head sores, use red charcoal to wash with flowing water, allowing the heat to cleanse it. Additionally, take a concoction of wine with Tong Sheng San (a traditional formula) while excluding the rhubarb prepared in wine, using ground coriander seeds, dragon’s liver, dragon's tail, Coptis, and white alum to mix into a paste for application. ### Excellent and Effective Methods Resolving skull issues relates to the fullness of maternal energy and blood, resulting in a firm and nurturing fontanelle in the child; if the mother is ill and her energy and blood are weak, the child's fontanelle will be soft and less substantial. The posterior fontanelle relates to the paternal essence; if the paternal energy is robust, the child's posterior fontanelle will be firm and nourishing. Conversely, if the father's energy is insufficient, due to excessive desire for drunkenness, the child’s posterior fontanelle will be soft and not durable, leading to a shorter life. If both parents are weak, their offspring will also have shortened lives. In such cases, the parents themselves may struggle to reach their full lifespan. The anterior fontanelle is also known as the \"Faith Gate\"; in Daoist terms, it is the \"Mud Ball,\" while the posterior fontanelle is referred to as the \"Brain Gate.\" The center of the head is also known as the \"Hundred Meetings.\" Hua Tuo provided detailed insights on facial diagnosis. The terms \"fontanelle\" and \"faith\" share the same pronunciation. When either the anterior or posterior fontanelles and the Hundred Meetings are open and weak, it is referred to as resolving skull issues."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"**Yellowing of Hair** Hair is the residue of blood. When a mother's blood and qi are plentiful, the hair is black, glossy, and vibrant; if the mother's blood is deficient, leaking, and failing, with menstrual irregularities, excessive indulgence in wine and lust, or if there are issues from the womb, the child's hair becomes yellow, dry, and brittle, leading to sores and boils. **Headache Relief** The kidneys govern the bone marrow, the spine is the pathway of the marrow, and the brain is the sea of marrow. The liver vessels and kidney vessels flow internally through the spine and converge in the brain. Hence, conditions affecting the head and pain in the spine are illnesses caused by wind-heat of the liver and kidneys, passed from mother to child. There are two types of headache relief: one occurs shortly after birth with the skull sutures split, the scalp appearing tight and glossy; this is due to heat in the marrow. The other occurs five to six months after birth when the fontanelle closes and then reopens; children of this situation are often difficult to nurture. For illnesses of wind-heat in the kidneys and liver, it is advisable to use a modified Qingpian pill to treat it, as it is to relieve the child. The Qingpian pill should be combined with equal parts of rhubarb, scutellaria, and coptis, ground into powder, formed into honey pills, and taken. The eight ingredients for relieving headaches include heat and additional components.

This results in swelling of the fontanel, varying in severity, and it's difficult to treat with the interplay of wind and heat. The treatment should focus on reducing heat and dispelling wind, with the use of the \"Xie Qing Wan\" for notable effects. **Sunken Fontanel** Prolonged diarrhea leads to deficiency of qi and blood, which cannot support the ascending vital energy. Fry dog spine and grind it into a fine powder, mix with egg white, and taking it will lead to recovery. The medicine should consist of \"Shen Ling Bai Zhu San,\" which will alleviate the sunken fontanel effectively. **Brain Sores** Brain sores occur shortly after birth in infants, manifesting as wounds forming crusts resembling overturned pancakes, caused by wind and heat. It is advisable to enhance the \"Xie Qing Wan\" with additional ingredients like Vitex negundo and fried burdock fruit. **Delayed Hair Growth** Hair is the surplus of blood and a sprout of the kidneys. If a child’s hair does not grow for a long time, and when it does, it is sparse and not black, this is due to insufficient kidney energy and blood. The \"Di Huang Wan\" is the prescribed remedy."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**Secrets of Infant Care** (Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan) **Resolving Head Issues** A child is inherently weak and timid; if the vital energy from the fetus is insufficient, the spirit becomes lacking, resulting in excessive white in the eyes, and the skull appears unlocked, with a pale complexion. Such children are difficult to raise and often do not live beyond eighteen years. If one restrains sexual desires, they may live a little longer but still not surpass forty days. There are two types of unlocked skulls: one that gradually opens after birth due to weak fetal energy and insufficient kidney strength. If it closes and then reopens, there may be cracks from the skull to the glabella, which can open slightly. If there are four cracks forming sutures, these are all indications of an unlocked skull. If the child is weak after an illness, with kidney deficiency causing water to overpower fire, the fiery essence rises, resulting in heat in the marrow; when the marrow is hot, it unlocks and the skull separates again. For those with kidney deficiency, it is advisable to take Rehmannia Pills to replenish the kidney's insufficiency, along with \"Tiaoyuan Decoction\" and \"Shiquandabu Decoction\" for both mother and child to strengthen the spleen and stomach, gradually solidifying energy and blood so that the skull naturally closes. For heat in the marrow, it is recommended to take Tongsheng Powder in pill form, avoiding nitrate; external application of the sealing method on the head may also help, or using a soft cloth to tightly bind it. Covering with a cloth for an extended period can also lead to a good outcome. Additionally, some children have heads that grow larger after birth, with red scalp and small eyes; this is known as \"brain sore.\" It results from the heat and toxic energy of the parents contained in the kidneys, which then rises to the brain, causing the head to enlarge and become red. Such conditions are difficult to treat and typically do not extend beyond eighteen years. If the child, before turning one, develops sores and crusts all over the head, experiencing itchiness and pain, leading to inconsolable crying day and night, this too is hard to manage. It is advisable to administer the previously mentioned \"苦参丸\" (Bitter Herb Pills) and apply \"松皮散\" (Pine Bark Powder)."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"**Swelling and Depression of the Fontanel** The prescription for swelling and depression of the fontanel states: \"Excessive heat causes swelling, while deficient heat causes depression.\" Swelling at the fontanel means the bone protrudes and swells upward. The classics say: \"Excessive heat causes swelling, due to the evil fire rising, causing the clear and bright qi to rise without descending.\" There are two signs: if the swelling is firm to the touch, this means there is a cold evil on the surface, closing the pores, preventing cold and heat from escaping, which is what is meant by \"qi rushing up causes firmness.\" In this case, one should use the Rising Yang Disperse Fire Decoction; this will resolve the stagnation. If the swelling feels soft and floating upon touch, this indicates accumulated heat within, steaming upward, referred to as \"qi rushing up causes softness.\" The use of a medicinal pill made of alcohol and Xuanwu should be employed to suppress this condition. When an outbreak occurs, the illness will stop immediately. **Scalp Sores** For sores on the scalp, do not allow them to become ulcers due to skin breakdown, resulting in pus that does not dry, with hair stuck together and lice breeding within. Scratching due to itching will lead to chronic conditions, resulting in leprosy. First, eliminate the lice by washing with a decoction of Acorus calamus, which will kill all the lice; let it dry, then mix mercury and fine powder in a bowl, grinding them together, and adding some saliva to moisten. Use your finger to dab the medicine onto the sores and within the hair. Once the lice are removed, apply a suitable amount of smoke from the autumn cowhide mixture with rosin, ground into a fine powder, and mixed with a little light powder and realgar, then heated and applied to the affected areas. For soft sores on the scalp that do not heal over time, applying the Purple Gold Pill will be effective."},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"**Delayed Hair Growth** The presence of hair on the head is like the presence of grass and trees on a mountain. Hair is an excess of blood, and its abundance or scarcity depends on the richness or depletion of blood. The hexagram of Kan represents blood; blood is the essence of the kidneys, and hair is a sprout of the kidneys, which is why it is black in color. If a child's hair does not grow for a long time or is not black when it does, this indicates kidney deficiency. It is advisable to use the Rehmannia Glutinosa Pill as treatment. After a serious illness, if the hair appears in tufts or is sparse, this indicates insufficient body fluids, resulting from malnourishment. It is recommended to use the Gathered Holy Powder as treatment. **Depressed Fontanelle** A depressed fontanelle refers to the depression of the fontanelle creating a pit. There are two signs: the classics say that a depression indicates deficient energy. After a serious illness, when body fluids are insufficient, and true energy sinks down creating a pit, one should greatly replenish original energy and use the Regulate Original Decoction with Cimicifuga. If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to a reduced appetite, and as the spleen governs the muscles, when the flesh decreases and the skin becomes thin, the fontanelle may appear protruding, which is not a true depression. In this case, one should take the Fat Baby Pill or Ginseng and Poria Powder to nourish the spleen and stomach so that appetite returns, the muscles become balanced, and the fontanelle no longer protrudes."},{"anchor":"trans-10p","marker":"10p","type":"translation","text":"### Concerns Regarding Head Deformities and Neck Weakness **Head Deformities** After a hundred days, if the head is flattened, the \"Book on Nurturing Young Hearts\" states that the condition is more serious than a skull indentation; this is a great void, and there is virtually no chance of survival. One must not see this as a disease but rather a failure of the parents. When a newborn’s skull is not fused, one should use a soft pillow made of mung beans and adjust it frequently; do not allow the head to rest on just one side, for then the skull will surely align properly. If after this the occipital bone is still sunk in, it is due to prolonged sleeping in one position. If it becomes difficult to nurture the child and the skull shows fractures and unevenness, it is not a sign of longevity. **Neck Weakness** If the head is tilted backward, it indicates a weak neck. The neck is the stem of the head, also known as the Heavenly Pillar Bone. A weak neck signifies that the Heavenly Pillar Bone cannot maintain the head, causing it to tilt forward, backward, or sideways—a serious condition. The symptoms can be twofold: if a newborn has a weak neck right from birth, it results from insufficient prenatal nourishment and weak kidney energy. The kidneys regulate the bones, while the liver regulates the tendons; when tendons don’t support the bones, fractures can occur, causing the mother to deplete the child's vitality. Such a child is difficult to nurture, rarely living beyond forty years. With kidney energy being weak, it is advisable to use Rehmannia Pills with added Angelica and Dipsacus for treatment. In cases where weakness arises after a severe illness, leading to an inability to hold up the head, it is a sign of deficient blood and energy, and one should take the Totally Restorative Decoction with honey pills. The texts state: the head is the dwelling of clarity and brightness. If the head is tilted or misaligned, the spirit will depart. Generally, individuals suffering from severe illness showing this symptom are difficult to treat."},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"**Kānyǎn (Malnutrition-related Eye Condition)** This condition is often due to excessive consumption of rich and spicy foods, which accumulates heat and leads to the spleen and stomach being impaired. This causes the eyes to become red and watering, the pupils to develop spots, and eventually to appear white over time, necessitating prompt treatment; otherwise, it may result in chronic disease. Initially, administer a heat-clearing drink, and then follow with Wǔgān Wán (Five Malnutrition Pills). **Jiělú (Head Unclosed Condition)** Zhongyang states that the condition of the head being unclosed at birth is due to insufficient kidney energy, which affects the formation of the head, leading to a tendency towards smiling less. Additionally, if the whites of the eyes are prominent and the body is thin, it indicates a disposition towards worry and little joy. I have observed this in cases of kidney deficiency. Yang states: for older infants whose cranial sutures remain open and unjoined, the kidneys govern the marrow, and the brain is considered the sea of marrow; when kidney energy is lacking, the brain and marrow are insufficient, resulting in the inability of the skull to close. A person deficient in brain marrow is like a tree without roots; generally, those with this condition will not survive long. In some cases, it takes several years to become incapacitated. If this condition is present, one should not remain passive; it is advisable to use Qiánshì Dìhuáng Wán (Qian's Rehmannia Pills) and also to prepare a fine powder of Nánxīng (Arisaema), mix it with rice vinegar, and apply it heated on scarlet silk, which is also an effective method. Applying Baiziren San (Platycladus Seed Powder) or Sanxin San (Three Aromatic Powder) is particularly excellent."},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"**Yuan Xian and Yuan Tian** Yuan Xian refers to the condition where the top of the head sinks. It is primarily caused by internal heat in the organs, leading to thirst and excessive drinking. This, in turn, results in diarrhea, and over time, the blood and energy become weak, unable to nourish the brain marrow. Hence, the top of the head sinks like a pit, not appearing full. To treat this, bone powder from a dog’s skull, roasted to a yellow powder, is mixed with chicken egg white and applied. Yuan Tian refers to swelling or protrusion at the top of the head. The spleen governs the muscles, and irregularities in nourishment—be it overfeeding or underfeeding, hot or cold—can lead to imbalances in the internal organs. This causes energy to surge upwards, leading to swelling and protrusion of the head, which appears raised like a pile. When cold energy surges, it is hard and firm, while when hot energy surges, it is soft. If it is cold, apply warmth; if hot, apply cooling. The treatment dosage should be adjusted accordingly. For children, if liver energy is excessive, or when wind-heat attacks, the condition may similarly arise. This condition is not easily resolved. For heat symptoms, use a large Lianqiao powder to dispel it; if it’s a surface heat symptom, use Chaihu powder. There is also Fengyuan powder to cover it. According to the theory, if a child’s stomach energy is balanced, the brain marrow will be full and the top of the head will gradually flatten. If the stomach is heated, it steams the internal organs, causing thirst and leading to diarrhea, which blocks heat in the organs. This weakens the blood and energy, hence the top of the head sinks.

If there is no luster in the eyes, it indicates kidney deficiency; treat with \"Di Huang Wan\". According to the \"Long Mu Lun\", when young children have crossed eyes, it is often due to accidents causing injury to the head, resulting in shock to the liver, leading to the condition. For this, \"Niu Huang Wan\" is recommended. For bloodshot eyes, take \"Sheng Shu Di Huang San\", as it promotes blood circulation. For heat toxins, use \"Xiao Fang Feng Tang\"; for wind toxins, use \"Xiao Liu Qi Yin\"; and for accumulated toxins, \"Xiao Ju Hua Gao\" is appropriate. If there are rashes affecting the eyes, \"Jue Ming San\" or \"Mi Meng Hua San\" is recommended. Additionally, \"Xi Jiao San\" or \"Shi Nan San\" can also be effective.

If it persists without healing, it may eventually lead to deafness. Long Gu San is indicated for this condition. Moreover, the Tang family has identified five types of ear discharge. The first type, \"yellow pus ear,\" usually has yellow pus discharging; the second type, \"red pus ear,\" typically has red pus; the third type, \"white pus ear,\" consistently has white pus; the fourth type, \"foul ear,\" has a stinky discharge from within; and the fifth type, \"hollow ear,\" presents with a hollow, ringing sound and sometimes discharges clear pus.

Alternatively, washing with water, whether warm or cold, without avoiding wind and cold can cause nasal congestion in the child. It is advisable to apply a nasal opening ointment and use dispersing medicine. If there are signs of fright and heat, peppermint powder can be taken, which is also good for the living. There is also nosebleed, which occurs when heat attacks the qi and affects the blood. The lungs control the skin and hair of the entire body, and the mouth opens the cavities to the nose. If cold first enters the skin and then attacks the qi forming heat, this heat then affects the blood. When the blood becomes heated and behaves erratically, it releases from the nose, which is called a nosebleed. If sweating does not occur and dryness and wheezing in the nose persist, it can lead to a nosebleed. Treatment methods follow traditional formulas and adjust dosages slightly. Huangqin Decoction and Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction are the main treatments. Boiled fresh Rehmannia and reed roots are especially effective.

This occurs due to insufficient essence and blood from the parents, and it is advisable to use Rehmannia Pills for supplementation. If the child is still nursing, the mother should also supplement to harmonize and nourish the spleen and kidneys. Additionally, this condition may arise from inherent weakness in kidney energy and improper nursing, leading to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, which would also require the use of the Qi-Increasing Decoction. In cases of diarrhea with weak qi and blood, where the spleen and stomach cannot provide nourishment, the same approach applies.

Ringing indicates that wind and qi clash, and pain suggests that there is evil wind in the brain. Heat in the kidneys steams and causes hearing issues; the pain deepens, producing thick pus.

The child’s diet and complexion may appear normal, but they cannot see at night, thus it is advisable to use restorative drinks. **Cranial Relief** In children, strong kidney energy results in the fontanelle being small and closed early; whereas weak kidney energy leads to an open fontanelle. If the fontanelle does not heal, the illness may attack repeatedly, making it extremely difficult to protect the child, which is a serious condition. **Discussion on Swollen and Sunken Fontanelle** All newborns have a fontanelle, as their internal energy is not yet full, their bone marrow is not complete, and nourishment is insufficient. Internal organs rely on the spleen and stomach for nourishment. After birth, when the child is fed with grains, their internal energy is replenished and bone marrow matures, leading to the closing of the fontanelle once they can eat. The fontanelle is connected to the spleen and stomach. The \"Seng Ji Jing\" states that the fontanelle is connected to earth, which corresponds to the spleen and stomach. If a child has a swollen fontanelle, it is due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, imbalance of hot and cold, angry crying when fed, or wheezing and coughing, leading to a reversal of Yin and Yang energy that causes the fontanelle to swell. It swells and feels soft with heat, and swells and feels hard with cold. A sunken fontanelle may result from diarrhea, frequent urination, past intake of cleansing medicines, inherent weak energy, or lingering other illnesses, all of which render the internal organs deficient and unable to nourish the fontanelle, hence causing it to sink. These are all severe conditions for children, and few manage to recover."},{"anchor":"trans-40p","marker":"40p","type":"translation","text":"**On Various Head Diseases** Soft boils that appear on a child's head are caused by the invasion of wind and cold, affecting the skin, lingering in the blood and qi, obstructing the meridians, and accumulating to form these boils, similar to those that arise on the body but located on the head. Initially, they appear red and swollen and hard; if the pathogen is mild, it may dissipate on its own. However, if the pathogen is severe, the swelling becomes red and painful, producing pus and blood. Due to the tightness of the scalp, it is often difficult to fully remove the pus when it becomes mature; there may be residual foul fluid that leads to recurrence or the emergence of new boils at the edges, resulting in continuous non-healing, often painfully abscessing, hence the name soft boils. For children with bald patches on the head, according to the Nine Worms theory: this is caused by pinworms interacting with wind pathogens, affecting the skin of the head, colliding with the blood and qi, and injuring the nourishing and protective aspects. The nourishing aspect relates to blood; when diseased, it leads to red baldness; the protective aspect relates to qi; when diseased, it causes white baldness. As the nourishing aspect is internal, it is more difficult for pathogens to affect it, hence cases of red baldness are rare; meanwhile, as the protective aspect is external, pathogens can easily invade, leading to more cases of white baldness."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"At first, it appears like spots of scabs, with flakes of skin on top. Gradually, it forms crusts, leading to wounds that ultimately result in nearly complete hair loss. If the crusts are scraped off, the wounds are filled with holes of varying sizes. There is pus that oozes out, and while there is no pain, there is an unbearable itch, indicating the presence of a \"wind\" insect. There is also a condition commonly called \"ghost licking the head,\" where a child with a scalp sore is said to be licked by a ghost overnight, resulting in red crusts covering the head, sometimes referred to as \"red baldness.\" The cause of a child's scalp sore is internal heat affecting the organs, which then rises to the head. Coupled with external wind and moisture, these factors combine, impacting the blood and qi, thereby leading to the sores, hence it is called scalp sores. This condition is distinct from bald sores. Bald sores can appear both white and red, with hard crusts covering the entire head. In contrast, scalp sores might only appear in one or two spots, lacking the whitish, hard, dry texture, often exuding pus and blood.

The heart governs the blood, and hair is considered the surplus of blood; thus, timidity leads to prolonged absence of growth. **Discussion on Diseases of the Ear** When a child suddenly suffers from deafness or diminished hearing, it is due to the invasion of wind pathogens affecting the Hand Taiyang channel. The pathogen follows this channel and enters the ear; when the pathogen clashes with the correct energy, it causes stagnation and blockage, resulting in deafness and inability to hear sounds. In mild cases, it may result in diminished hearing, where the ear feels heavy, making it hard to distinguish faint sounds, while louder noises can still be heard."},{"anchor":"trans-43p","marker":"43p","type":"translation","text":"**Ear Noises and Pain** If a child experiences ringing or pain in the ears, it is due to the invasion of wind evil into the ears, which interferes with vital energy. If it collides with blood and qi, it results in ringing; if it affects the meridians, it leads to pain. **Ear Swelling and Pus** If a child has swelling or sores in the ears producing pus, it results from a combination of wind and dampness entering the ears, affecting the opposition between evil and vital energy, colliding with qi and blood, and damaging the meridians. If mild, it causes swelling; if severe, sores may develop. If bodily fluids accumulate and break down, pus and blood may emerge. Additionally, if water or tears enter the ears, obstructing vital energy, this too can lead to pus, commonly referred to as \"tinnitus\" or \"purulent ear.\" **Eye Diseases Discussion** When a child has eye diseases, it is often due to excessive consumption of sweet and sour foods, generating internal heat and affecting the liver meridian, which manifests in the eyes. This may lead to redness, swelling, itching, or pain; excessive tearing; the presence of red veins; or the formation of membranes. If phlegm, dampness, and toxic qi invade the liver, causing its energy to become obstructed, then clarity is not achieved; hence, even if the pupils are intact, vision may be impaired, a condition termed \"dimming vision.\" If one cannot see during the day, it is considered an evil affecting the yin of the meridians, known as \"night blindness,\" akin to a bird that cannot see in the dark.

If wind and dampness interact, sores and purulent discharge may develop in the nose. If heat from the brain attacks the nose leading to dryness, or if sores and scabs form, they may be hard and devoid of purulent discharge. — From the \"Young and Young Near Compilation\" by Chen Zhi (Ming Dynasty) **Nasal Collapse** Nasal collapse occurs due to deficiency of kidney qi, leading to insufficient brain marrow, with damp heat ascending, causing the cranial sutures to separate and not align.

The \"Expanded Meaning\" suggests treating nasal collapse with crab claws mixed with Rhizoma Bletillae, ground into a paste and applied to the crown. **Nasal Depression** Nasal depression occurs when qi and blood are both deficient and the original qi sinks. It is suitable to use the Middle-Qi Boosting Decoction; if the hands and feet are cold, add ginger, cassia, and even prepared aconite. **Nasal Filling** Nasal filling occurs due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach leading to a reversal of qi that ascends.

He was treated with middle supplementing energy soup and ginseng stomach-nourishing soup, along with the herbal remedy for children, leading to recovery. Another child had slightly swollen eyelids, cough, nausea, and pale urine. I considered this a spleen problem with food retention. I used five-flavor subtle efficacy powder primarily, supplemented by the herbal remedy for children, and he recovered. Later, due to dietary indiscretion, his night vision became poor again. I explained that this was damage to the spleen and stomach, requiring nourishment as the primary treatment. Doubting this, he took harsh medicines, which later led to a wind illness, and he became unable to rise. A child developed a fever and sweated, with red eyes and spasms. Upon examining the mother, she had a history of liver heat and fever. I used the subtle efficacy powder with added bupleurum and elevation hemp, and both mother and child improved slightly. They continued with an enhanced version of the carefree powder, and the heat subsided.

Another young child with either white or blue eyes experienced redness and pain; after taking fire-clearing medicine, the eyes appeared bloodshot. The pulse was large or floating and weak, but weak upon palpation. I prescribed several doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with added Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, causing the external symptoms to gradually diminish and the pulse to stabilize, eventually leading to recovery after several doses. A young child with abdominal pain from food retention took a purgative, resulting in increased redness and pain in the eyes, with alternating chills and fever, reduced appetite, and cold hands and feet. I used Liu Jun Shen Ma, Pao Jiang, and the symptoms improved immediately; however, the chills and fever persisted. I then administered Si Jun Tang, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma to stabilize the condition. In another case, a child experienced eye redness and pain after taking a laxative, leading to intensified chills and fever. I suspected damage to the spleen and stomach, so I used Si Jun Tang, Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, Pao Jiang, and Diao Teng Gou, which resolved the chills and fever.

One child had a face that was bluish-yellow for ten days, indicating stomach heat and jaundice. By using Xiaohuangsan mixed with a little milk, the child recovered. Later, the child again showed yellowing of the body and tongue, and the same powder was used to stabilize the condition. Another child had yellow eyes, and it was known that the mother’s consumption of foods that caused her to be overly weighed led to this condition. By administering Yuejuwan to the mother and Xiaohuangsan to the child, both were cured. A child presented with a cold and hot bluish face, appearing thin and weak, and had cataracts. Treatment with Jiuwweiliuhuiwan and Wuwweiyigongsan gradually reduced the cataract; then, Simi Feierwan and Wuwweiyigongsan were employed to grow the child's flesh.

One child was overfed while nursing, took too much medication, had abdominal swelling and reduced appetite, and experienced blurred vision. After taking eye medication, he gradually developed a floating cataract.

After taking diaphoretic medicines, his vision gradually worsened; after taking cooling medicines, his appetite decreased daily, leading to a gradual dulling of his eyesight. I diagnosed him with qi deficiency and used Ren Shen Bu Wei Tang to strengthen the stomach, which led to an increase in appetite. I also used Qian Jin Bu Gan Wan and an eye fumigation method, resulting in recovery. A twelve-year-old girl developed a white cataract, with a yellowish face and swollen features, along with dry mouth and diarrhea. She was treated with Si Wei Fei Er Wan and recovered. A young child had photophobia, redness of the eyes, hot feet, inconsistent bowels, and coughing with reduced appetite. I aimed to treat for liver deficiency due to wind. I noted that the hot feet and abnormal urination indicated kidney and liver deficiency, while the inconsistent bowels and coughing revealed spleen and lung weakness. In the morning, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and in the evening, I provided Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, gradually restoring his original energy. I then supplemented with Si Wei Fei Er Wan, and after over a month, he was cured. A child complained of eye pain.

He took the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction along with the previous pills and was cured. There was a child who experienced spasms due to fright, which caused eye twitching.

I suggested that since it was liver-related deficient heat, he should take Dihuang pills to replenish it, and he recovered. The liver's qi is yang and heat, while the liver's blood is yin and water. Liver conditions, unless caused by liver fire or blood dryness leading to wind, are typically due to deficient liver blood causing fire. In the case of an acute condition presenting with both sickness and a vigorous appearance, it is appropriate to use laxatives like Qingwan sparingly; for chronic cases with both sickness and weak appearance, Dihuang pills should be used to nourish the kidney and liver. The reason for this condition is often insufficient liver blood leading to the generation of wind, so harsh purgatives should not be used. The classic states that for weak diseases, one should nourish their source; for strong diseases, one should drain their offshoot. In a previous case where there was clear evidence of liver heat, treatments like Chaihu and Huanglian were suitable to address the heart's heat. The practitioner must be discerning. A thirteen-year-old boy experienced prolonged eye pain, gradually developing a greenish film, and later became red and decayed. His left pulse was stringy and rapid. Treatment with Jiuwwei Luohui pills and an enhanced version of Xiaoyao powder led to recovery.
