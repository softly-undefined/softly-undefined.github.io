<p><strong>The Gate of Seeds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Natural Theory of Ancient Times</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What is the reason that some who are old still have children? Qibo replied: This is because their heavenly lifespan has exceeded the norm, their vital energy flows smoothly, and there is an abundance of kidney essence. Even though they have children, males may not exceed eighty, and females may not exceed seventy; thus, the essence of heaven and earth is entirely depleted. 【Note: The heavenly lifespan exceeds the normal limit, indicating a richness of the innate essence. The vital energy flowing smoothly shows that the acquired vitality remains open, which is why there can still be children despite the depletion of heaven and earth&#39;s essence, especially at the numbers of seventy or eighty.】 The Emperor asked: Is it possible for those who cultivate the Way to have children if they are already over a hundred years old? Qibo replied: Those who cultivate the Way can delay aging and maintain their physical form, so even though they live long lives, they can still bear children. 【Note: Only those who cultivate the Way can transcend the numerical limits of yin and yang established by heaven and earth.】<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>The Thousand Gold Formulas</h3>
<p><strong>Auspicious Days for Conception</strong></p>
<p>In the methodology of controlling the intercourse, one should avoid days of the Bing and Ding, as well as the full moon, new moon, heavy winds, heavy rain, dense fog, extreme cold, extreme heat, thunder and lightning, darkened skies, eclipses of the sun and moon, rainbows, and earthquakes. If intercourse occurs on such days, it will harm the spirit of the person, bringing bad fortune. It will significantly harm the male, causing illness in the female. The offspring will most likely be afflicted with insanity, stubbornness, muteness, deafness, blindness, numerous ailments, short lives, lack of filial piety, and cruelty.</p>
<p>Additionally, one should avoid engaging in intercourse beneath the light of celestial bodies, within temples and Buddhist monasteries, near wells, kitchens, or latrines, and beside graves or coffins. If one engages in intercourse according to the methods prescribed, then there will be blessings, virtues, and wise and good beings who will take root in the womb, leading to harmonious character and endeavors, daily expansion of the family’s fortune, and gathering of auspicious omens. However, if done improperly, unworthy and foolish beings will enter the womb, resulting in dangerous traits in the parents, failed endeavors, familial decline, and frequent misfortunes. Even if the offspring grow up, they may lead to the ruin of the family and country.</p>
<p>The response of good and bad fortune is akin to echoes; it is a natural principle that should not be ignored. If one desires children, they should wait until the woman has completed her menstrual cycle by a day, three days, or five days, choosing auspicious days resembling kings and favorable lunar mansions, and during the energetic hours after midnight for conception. This will ensure male offspring who are long-lived, virtuous, and of high status. If conception occurs two days, four days, or six days after menstruation ends, it will definitely result in female offspring. After six days, one should not attempt conception, as it will not yield children nor produce a person.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Wang Xiangri</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Prohibitions</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: When a person is angry, and their blood and energy are unsettled, engaging in sexual intercourse can lead to the onset of carbuncles. One should also not endure a full bladder during intercourse, as it can cause painful urination, discomfort in the genitals, and pallor. Traveling and arriving at someone else&#39;s quarters exhausted can lead to five kinds of labor that weaken a man and cause infertility. Furthermore, if a woman engages in intercourse before her menstrual cycle has completely ended, it may lead to illness and white spots on the skin. Mercury should not come near the genitals, as it can cause contraction. The fats of deer and boar should also be avoided, as they can lead to impotence.</p>
<h3>Discussions on Sexual Restoration</h3>
<p>Someone asked: The &quot;Thousand Ducat Formulas&quot; contains methods for sexual restoration, are these permissible? I responded: The transmission states: Fortune and misfortune, regrets and resentments arise from actions, and thus human illnesses also arise from actions. When actions intensify, they can lead to illness and death. Life in humans is characterized by the heart as fire above and the kidney as water below; water can rise while fire can descend. This rise and fall has no end, thus life persists. Water is still in nature, while fire is dynamic; the dynamic is easy while the still is difficult. The sages never ceased to speak about this. Confucians teach: “Correct the heart, focus the heart, nourish the heart,” which serves to guard against the reckless movement of fire. Physicians teach tranquility and emptiness, maintaining one’s spirit inwardly, which also serves to restrain the reckless movements of fire.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The fire of the lower body resides within the liver and kidney&#39;s yin; when the sovereign fire does not act recklessly, the fire only fulfills its mandate and maintains its position. How could there be a cruel blaze or a wild force? In the &quot;I Ching,&quot; the image of the lake is associated with the young girl. Lake signifies harmony, encountering the young man which brings mutual attraction. Attraction is an unconscious feeling. The mountain represents stopping. The practices in the chamber embody the meaning of stopping. If one encounters the mountain yet does not stop, it is merely a thief causing harm; what benefit can come from that? Upon reflecting on the intention of the &quot;Thousand Golds,&quot; those in their prime who indulge are like tranquil water, unlike the stillness of the sun, hence the methods in the chamber are established as aids for enhancement. This applies to those who are strong and calm against an enemy, remaining unmoved. If one lacks the heart of a sage or the essence of an immortal, it is difficult to change. Women adapt to water; men adapt to fire. Water can control fire; one delights in giving, the other delights in receiving—this is the principle of nature. If one approaches the chamber merely for enhancement, it often leads to harm. Furthermore, throughout history, customs have increasingly become lax, resources have continually diminished, dreams are often misguided, making it quite challenging!<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Great indeed! The mystery of life lies in the interplay of yin and yang! The vital principle of yin and yang, which gives rise to all things without cease, is based in the cosmos; within humans, it is rooted in essence and blood. Thus, although one possesses the subtlety of the Dao, the potential for cultivation and application actually resides there. Observed from the perspective of the constant, even the most foolish of men and women can understand this. However, when one considers the variable aspects, even the wise and benevolent may encounter limitations. Therefore, the essence (ti) is yin and yang, essence and blood; the application (yong) is the harmonious interaction of yin and yang. When essence and blood are sufficient and they harmonize in due time, this is the constant state. What the foolish can understand is merely the principle of nature. When essence and blood are deficient and they fail to harmonize at the right time, this is the variable state. What the wise and benevolent cannot grasp is merely a state of adversity.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The way it is in its usual state, I already know it does not rely on being expressed in words. However, when it changes, how could one not discern it? A sage who understands the Way must surely recognize the moments of change and apply his intentions accordingly. This is the principle, and the wise philosophers have understood it, allowing even the foolish to grasp its meaning. I will explain in detail.</p>
<p>The Book of Changes states: &quot;Heaven and Earth are harmonious; all things transform into their essence. The union of male and female creates life.&quot; It also says: &quot;The harmony of yin and yang brings virtue, and the essence of hardness and softness has form. It is precisely said that alone, the yang does not give birth, and alone, the yin does not come into being.&quot; This suggests that the relationship between husband and wife is akin to that of Heaven and Earth. The way of Heaven and Earth is such that when yin and yang are in harmony, all things flourish; the way of husband and wife is similarly that when yin and yang are in harmony, men and women give life.</p>
<p>If there is even a slight deficiency in the male essence or the female blood, the conception of the fetus cannot occur. Thus, those who wish to have children must first examine whether their wife&#39;s menstrual cycle is regular.</p>
<p>The menstrual cycle is the norm, like the sun and moon, which arrive on schedule and depart on schedule, without fail; hence it is called the menstrual cycle. Sometimes, there are irregularities: it may come too early or too late, might occur twice in one month or once every other month; there may be cases of blockage where it does not occur, or it may come too frequently and not stop; it may be accompanied by pain before or after, or may have a different color—black, purple, pale; there may be white discharge, excessive leucorrhea, or abnormal fluid. These all indicate an imbalance in blood and qi. Such cases must be diagnosed and treated with medicine accordingly. </p>
<p>Moreover, understanding the ailments of men is also essential.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If there are deficiencies, they may include kidney deficiency with slippery essence, cold and clear essence; sometimes, one is unable to maintain firmness when faced with matters, and when firm, it flows but does not shoot; there may be night sweats and nocturnal emissions, as well as turbid urine and difficult urination; there may be weakness in the waist that prevents turning or swaying, and a penchant for lust that results in yin deficiency; there are those with labor heat and those with empty cold, all of which indicate insufficient essence and qi. Such cases must be treated according to symptoms to replenish and benefit. A man must be free from these ailments before he can rightly blame the woman. If such conditions exist, they indeed are the man&#39;s responsibility. How can he place the blame on the woman? If the woman is well, there is little more that can be done. When a woman&#39;s meridians are regulated and a man&#39;s true essence is sufficient, then yin and yang are in harmony, and qi and blood are balanced, thus no ailments arise and offspring can be conceived. If the child is also healthy, what difficulty is there in succession? Once yin and yang are harmonized, proper methods should also be employed, and human efforts cannot be neglected. The saying goes: &quot;In the span of thirty days, count two and a half days; those of twenty-eight or nine must be mindful. The falling blossoms cover the ground is an auspicious time, while letting golden water overtake the time leads to chaos. Times of chaos waste effort; one searches for remaining blossoms at the top and the bottom of the tree. Yet, if one knows how to unravel the flower, it can produce fruit; why worry that the fragrant osmanthus will not come in clusters?&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>This passage discusses the timing of conception in relation to a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle. It states that when a woman&#39;s menstruation has just ended, and her body is ready for fertilization, it is an opportune moment for conception. During this time, the uterus is open, making it ideal for receiving sperm to create a pregnancy, and human efforts should align with this natural timing to preserve the wonders of creation. If this key period is missed, the uterus will close and will not receive the fertilized egg.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are specific outcomes based on the timing of intercourse after menstruation. If intercourse occurs one, three, or five days after menstruation, a male child is likely to be conceived; if it occurs two, four, or six days afterward, a female child is more likely. Additionally, the text explains the interaction of Yin (female) and Yang (male) forces in conception: if the Yin energy (blood) arrives first and the Yang energy (semen) comes later, the Yang becomes dominant, resulting in a male child. Conversely, if the Yang energy arrives first, followed by the Yin, the Yin becomes dominant, leading to a female child. This highlights the critical balance between these two forces in determining the sex of the child.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>To achieve an extensive offspring, one must undoubtedly follow this path. Indeed, by seeking it thus, one will also obtain it through this means. Those who do not adhere may occasionally find success, but it is merely due to luck. However, there are instances of women who carry burdens during pregnancy. Historical analysis shows that although many pregnancies end in miscarriage, and many births are fraught with difficulties, and numerous children suffer from ailments—how do we know this is the case? When observing an infant in swaddling clothes, there are no disturbances from the seven emotions within, nor invasions from the six energies outside; thus, it should be free from illness. Yet the ailments include daily changes in heat, fright, skin eruptions, convulsions, monthly sores, hair spasms, phlegm and wheezing, chickenpox, rashes, red tumors, skull deformities, chest deformities, obstruction of the jaw, internal hanging, thrush, wooden tongue, heavy tongue, and other symptoms—are they not rooted in the initial essence and blood of the parents along with the weaknesses of the pregnant mother, who fails to exercise restraint? Moreover, if less than a hundred days have passed and she indulges in sour flavors, or if she consumes rich and fatty dishes before the time is right, a hundred diseases arise from this.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The issues referred to include severe nausea, five types of vomiting, jaundice and abdominal swelling, edema and abdominal masses, intermittent fevers with dysentery, and various forms of diarrhea. Are these not all caused by excessive indulgence in diet and improper care? From this perspective, it seems that the majority of ailments stem from prenatal issues, with a smaller portion arising from dietary harm. </p>
<p>If the body&#39;s constitution is weak and its nourishment not substantial, and if the pregnant woman is affected by strong emotions, the fetal energy becomes heightened. She may crave fried and flavorful foods or may be subject to unchecked emotions, leading to extreme cold. Little do they realize that the fetus, connected through the umbilical cord, shares the mother’s hunger and fullness; any movement, eating, or resting by the mother directly impacts the fetus, thus causing potential ailments.</p>
<p>In ancient times, pregnant women followed strict guidelines: they slept without turning, sat without leaning, stood without favoring one leg, refrained from eating unusual flavors, avoided unwholesome foods, did not sit on uneven ground, averted their gaze from improper sights, and did not listen to lewd sounds. At night, they would have the blind recite poetry and proper teachings, and by following these practices, children would be born healthy and handsome, and possess remarkable talents.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Why do people today love their children without restraint, indulging them excessively, ultimately causing harm? Many children die in vain, shackled like prisoners to the walls, unable to fulfill their rightful destinies. Is this any different? Today, one observes gentle and virtuous women, who live with order during pregnancy and childbirth, producing children who are rarely ill, with mild occurrences of diseases such as smallpox; they can serve as models and examples. Shouldn’t those who bear the responsibility of parenthood adopt such behavior? From this perspective, the distinction between the wise and the foolish becomes evident. Mencius said: &quot;There are three types of unfilial conduct, and having no descendants is the greatest.&quot; Indeed, filial duty is known through serving parents, but who realizes that the greatest aspect of filial duty is to ensure a good continuation of one’s lineage? It is regrettable that there are those who understand this yet do not know the path to having children! How can one resign themselves to fate and succumb to destiny; how can one fall into confusion over trivial matters? It is perplexing! Generally speaking, a gentleman should create his own destiny and not resign himself to fate. I say this to illustrate a principle that is consistent with reason, not as an assertion devoid of evidence.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Yin Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Remaining Discussions on Knowledge and Investigation&quot; states: Yang is often in excess, while Yin is often insufficient. Qi is usually abundant, while blood is often lacking. The excess Yang is not merely referring to the primordial Yang of the heart but denotes various forms of fire. There are two types of fire: the heart represents the sovereign fire, which is the correct and singular fire of the five elements; the kidney represents the ministerial fire, which is the fire of deviation and disorder. Whenever there is movement, the ministerial fire burns along, consuming the true Yin and depleting the essence and marrow. The texts say: &quot;Strengthening the water ruler to control the Yang light&quot; refers to this. It also says: For those with insufficient form, warm them with Qi; for those with insufficient essence, replenish them with flavor. To warm means to nourish and harmonize the Qi to overcome movement with stillness, as the texts say: &quot;Those who labor should be warmed.&quot; To flavor means medicinal flavor. The texts state: &quot;The birth of Yin fundamentally lies in the five flavors.&quot; Thus, it is evident that replenishing Yin is necessary for everyone, being essential from youth to old age. Danxi stated: &quot;Those who become ill due to fire account for eighteen out of ten; those who fall ill without the influence of fire are very rare.&quot; Therefore, fire is an unrooted element; within a person&#39;s body, in the five organs and six bowels, nothing is absent, and only the prominence of Yin can subdue it. Zhao Jizong argued: &quot;Since Yin is inherently insufficient, there is no need to replenish it; if one replenishes what is lacking to the point of excess, it could lead to the harm of overabundance.&quot;<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Ah! This is the thought of Zhao Yi! If the help is insufficient, it must be supplemented; if there is deficiency, it should be addressed naturally. What is real is real, what is empty is empty; remedy the deep-rooted ailments. If one is in danger and does not hold on, or if one falls and is not supported, then what use is that assistance? The classics state: Those who suffer from cold yet become hot must take in the yin. Therefore, when there is a deficiency in yin, it leads to the rise of empty heat, causing essence, blood, and fluids to dry up, resulting in symptoms of night sweats, cloudy urine, and internal heat due to exhaustion. The treatment for this deficiency of water must include yin-replenishing agents, as well as those that nourish the blood, harmonize the interior, enrich yin, and reduce heat. Furthermore, it is said: To tonify the kidneys, one does not necessarily need to do so with cold; strengthening the yin of the kidneys can still manage heat. This certainly does not entail relying solely on the knowledge of tonifying yin, but rather, one should recognize what is fundamentally essential for strengthening yin. Otherwise, one might often see that bitter cold harms the stomach, clinging to a single method without authority, endangering oneself, while wishing to have children—how could that be possible? Thus, the yin-replenishing agents, even if there is no ailment, can still be taken regularly, so to speak, treating the root slowly. Additionally, by calming the mind and easing worries to nourish, frequent consumption of strengthening agents like Jian Gan and Ban Long will likely yield the desired result in progeny—can it be observed in the palms? How many people, lacking insight, readily believe in superficial remedies, hastily consuming acrid, hot, fragrant, and drying agents to boost yang—this is nothing short of trying to use fire to control fire, throwing stones to rescue someone from drowning, or using firewood to put out a fire. How different is this! Wise gentlemen, may you take caution!<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>On Regulating Menstrual Seeds</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, the Heavenly essence arrives, the Ren vessel opens, and the Chong vessel is abundant, menstruation occurs regularly, and then she can conceive. The Ren vessel governs the womb; when it is open, it signifies the well-being of the vagina. The Chong vessel is the sea of blood; when it is abundant, both vital energy and blood flourish. When a woman’s kidney energy is strong, and the Ren and Chong vessels circulate smoothly, like the waxing and waning of the moon, menstruation will occur at regular intervals, indicating regulation, and if she engages in intercourse, she can conceive. Otherwise, irregularities occur three to five times, which is referred to as lack of regulation. Lack of regulation can lead to numerous ailments, even unto incurable conditions; how can one discuss pregnancy then? It is stated: Diseases of the two Yang affecting the heart and spleen can create difficult hidden paths. If a woman does not menstruate, it leads to symptoms such as wind dissipating or breath disturbances, and can result in death without remedy. Moreover, since the heart belongs to Yang and governs blood, while the spleen supports blood in circulating energy, if menstruation is obstructed, it may not only be due to insufficient heart energy, but also from worries affecting the spleen, causing exhaustion and inadequate digestion. This leads to weakened sustenance of lung metal, and kidney water fails to nourish. The menstrual blood and bodily fluids gradually dry up, leading to irregularities of three to five cycles, eventually resulting in complete closure and depletion. Such internal heat and bone steaming can create difficult-to-treat conditions, resulting in severe outcomes.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Therefore, nurturing the heart leads to the generation of blood, and strengthening the spleen allows for the distribution of qi. When these two achieve harmony, qi flows freely and blood circulates smoothly, making the regulation of menstruation essential; thus, there is no cause for concern. Moreover, during menstruation, one must protect themselves as during childbirth, avoiding excessive labor, refraining from bathing, and being cautious of extreme cold, heat, joy, and anger. Any disruption can lead to illness. </p>
<p>For treatment methods: if there is stagnation of qi and deficiency of blood, with symptoms like tidal fever and jaundice, while menstruation is irregular, use formulas like Dan Gui San and Xiang Fu Wan; for qi deficiency with blood heat, arriving too early and being excessive, treat with Zhen Jing Tang and Gu Jing Wan; if menstruation is delayed with abdominal pain, use Cu Jing Tang and Hong Hua San; for dampness and phlegm causing numbness, use Zhu Fu Wan to dry it out. Additionally, for issues relating to deficiency and excess, cold and heat, consult the pulse for details. How can there be unregulated menstruation and issues with conception?</p>
<p>According to traditional teachings, a man must have sufficient qi and robust essence, while a woman should have a well-regulated menstruation and ample blood before pregnancy can be expected. Hence, both partners should seek this balance. This text elaborates on the path to pregnancy but does not delve into the regulation of menstruation, as that has already been thoroughly covered in women&#39;s medical literature. Therefore, it will not be repeated here.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Meaning of Grass 【Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang】</p>
<p>A Discussion on the Use of Seed and Strong Yang Heating Medicine</p>
<p>In life, there is joy in nature, joy in power, and joy in a healthy body. The joy in nature is like spring in all seasons, where everything shares the same essence. Even in a humble dwelling or amidst hardship and difficulties, one can still find joy. The mountains, streams, winds, and moons—with me here, I am the host; the wood, stone, birds, and fish become all my friends. Why be indulgent in passivity or give in to lewd desires? Even the smallest creation has nothing to hold onto for frivolity. As for the joy of power and the joy of health that resists aging, only those who are truly blessed can possess both. The source of wealth and longevity comes from two paths of fortune: the youthfulness’s natural simplicity is the foundation for longevity, even if it lacks brilliance; youthful cunning and vitality, while valuable, may seem overly refined. Between these two lies a balance, half given by heaven and half earned by oneself. After striving, one must realize that this body is entrusted by heaven, and thus ought to preserve vitality and spirit in gratitude for heavenly favor.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If a woman loves fully and a man delights completely, exhausting what one naturally possesses, while relying on medicinal potions and demanding quick results, this brings forth unwise little people who master the tricks to harm others in hopes of swift gains. Though past generations have made similar mistakes, today&#39;s situation is more severe. The sign of peace and harmony has turned into urgency; the course of the world has been transformed by fiery enthusiasm, and with hasty remedies, how can one avoid destruction? This path is well understood by the practitioners of traditional medicine, but scholars and officials are reluctant to engage deeply with it. </p>
<p>It is said that the way of yin and yang hinges on harmony. When they are discordant, it is like having spring without autumn or winter without summer. Therefore, aligning them together is called the way of the sage. This segment of scripture has been buried by earlier commentaries, yet it clearly states that the sage understands the principles of interaction between men and women, and that such a union relies on the secrecy of yang energy, which must be conserved and not leaked. </p>
<p>Thus, yin and yang must be harmonized; a spring without an autumn signifies a lack of yin, and a winter without a summer signifies a lack of yang. Therefore, the sage merely adjusts the extremes to return to harmony, thus establishing the principles of interaction. The sage embodies the vital essence of great harmony and holds life within. </p>
<p>When I observe tuning strings and striking bells or gongs, although these interactions can harmonize the emotional dispositions of people, one must take into account their own vital energy. Similarly, rituals and music cultivate civility, and kindness and righteousness flourish—though the prosperities of the people are abundant, the same should apply to one&#39;s own descendants. </p>
<p>Thus, for those who seek to widely propagate their lineage, the principles of medicinal use should focus only on pure and harmonious remedies, avoiding mixed and problematic ones that invite discord.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The text mentions the four characters Yin, Ping, Yang, and Mi, which notably intertwine in meaning. It suggests that when Yin is balanced, without excess or deficiency, then Yang can achieve its hidden state without leaking out. This illustrates that the secrets of Yang are of utmost importance in the union of the sacred and divine. Furthermore, the secret of Yang must cede its authority to Yin, as Yang is rooted in Yin, and nurturing Yin is essential for the foundation of Yang.</p>
<p>However, people today, using harsh and potent medicines to drain their Yin, mistakenly believe they are nurturing Yang. They further exhaust their vitality through excessive sexual indulgence, gradually leading to the depletion of marrow and muscle, confusion of spirit, loss of energy, and even premature aging, yet they remain unaware of the harm caused by their medicine, which is indeed lamentable!</p>
<p>I once encountered a physician from Zhejiang, with the surname Song, who created large pills in the capital and distributed them to officials under the guise of being made from umbilical cord and fetal hair. In reality, they contained refined sulfur. Taking these pills caused a rapid and pleasing strengthening of Yang, but soon after, numerous dry illnesses emerged. Many elders in my hometown who fell victim to this can be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Recently, in a visit to Lucheng, I heard about Zhang Hongyi, a diligent official who suffered brain damage from ingesting red lead, and his condition has persisted day and night without cessation. Indeed, the brain is the sea of marrow; when the brain becomes heated, the marrow throughout the body rapidly depletes, and ultimately, until the heat is removed, the marrow is exhausted first, leading to weakness of the bones and difficulty in movement.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Visiting the old residence of Mr. Tianru in Louzhou, I noticed a thick yellow phlegm in my nose. The wooden walls were stained a deep yellow, and the color penetrated into the wood, which could not be scrubbed away. Inquiring about it, I learned that it was caused by taking hot medicinal seeds, which subsequently led to cold and minor ailments, ultimately resulting in a complete inability to rise. Alas! The heat in the brain had reached its extreme, producing yellow phlegm; the heat emitted from the nose could still permeate the wood. How could I not realize that when heat is excessive, it generates wind, yet I treated external symptoms without addressing the internal issues? What more can be said?</p>
<p>In my hometown, Mr. Liu Shilu took hot medicine and suffered from thirst; the physician Deng Jicun firmly insisted he take six-flavor Rehmannia Decoction for a thousand doses, which indeed proved effective. This treatment draws on the principle of harnessing the water lord to regulate the sun&#39;s energy. </p>
<p>Yuan Tiren from Gaoyou utilized experiential remedies based on the balance of yin and yang, reflecting the understanding of the harmony between yin and yang. This esteemed old physician, who was discerning about medicines, documented both approaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, alchemists used water from black lead, calling it divine water or gold elixir to deceive people. In cases of phlegm-fire diseases, initially, one might feel slightly better after the downward motion is achieved, yet they do not realize that the nature of lead is extremely drying, which further harms by depleting the yin. </p>
<p>There were also methods using steaming of the umbilical area, referred to as the practices of Pengzu. The umbilicus is the root of human life; combining strongly hot dispersive herbs like musk, sulfur, and aconite with burning moxa to steam, one might escape serious harm if not affected too much, but if it disturbs the vital energy without proper balance, it leads to complications or even a swift demise. </p>
<p>I heard the seasoned physician Mu Yungu from Louzhong once advised: “The method of steaming the umbilicus is harmful, not beneficial; it must never be practiced.” Such profound words! I have presented these matters for consideration.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p>The heart contains blood, and the kidneys store essence. When essence and blood are abundant, hair remains unturned gray, complexion remains vibrant, one can still father children in old age, thereby prolonging life. Premature aging often results from the overuse of warming medicines that fail to nourish essence and blood. Among medicines that replenish essence and blood, the two Dihuang herbs (raw and cooked) stand out. People often know to take the two Dihuang herbs but fail to recognize that Asparagus Racemosus serves as a guide for their effects. Raw Dihuang can nourish heart blood, with Ophiopogon Japonicus directing this nourishment; cooked Dihuang can replenish kidney essence, with another Asparagus guiding this replenishment. These four ingredients work synergistically. The <em>Herbal Classic</em> additionally emphasizes Ginseng as a primary agent for harmonizing heart energy, hence its inclusion.</p>

<p>This medicine can replenish all deficiencies and injuries, remedying the five labors and seven damages; its effects cannot be fully described. If four individuals jointly prepare a single dose and consume it, it can prolong life and increase descendants. The method involves four people collaborating to process one deer, and then they divide and consume it. After a year, they can prepare it again, and if they do this for four years, each person will end up with a whole deer. However, if one person tries to prepare a single dose alone, it may spoil over time, and the medicinal potency will diminish.</p>
<p>For preparing the deer, take one pair of deer (there&#39;s no restriction on gender), bind them and slaughter them, remove the fur and internal organs, then wash them clean and render them into a paste. The deer meat should be cooked thoroughly, sliced, and dried into powder; the skin should be mixed in with a basic broth to create a paste, which is then combined with the powdered medicine to form pills. The bones should be ground into powder and mixed together with the meat powder and medicinal powder, kneaded with glue.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Not made into pills, add honey: ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, poria, raw rhubarb, broken old paper, morinda root, angelica, ligusticum, cooked rehmannia, tian dong, mai dong, dried tangerine peel, roasted licorice, goji berries, jujube, eucommia, achyranthes, sutra stone, hulu ba, dried yam, fox nut seeds, dodder seeds, schisandra, raspberry, mulberry seeds, and piece of cistanche, each one pound.

When the deer gelatin is prepared, combine into pills the size of a Phoenix seed, roast dry, using raw yellow silk to make fifty small bags, each holding about one pound, and hang them in a breezy place. Once a bag is used, take another bag. During humid days, lightly heat in the fire once or twice for best results.

<p>For this, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1斗 of Qian Shi (gorgon fruit)</li>
<li>Dried lotus flesh, peeled and roasted</li>
<li>Fresh coix seeds</li>
<li>Dried yam, each 1升</li>
<li>2升 of glutinous rice</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind these ingredients into a powder and mix them thoroughly. Store in a single container. In summer, use 3升 of Qian Shi as the main ingredient, reducing the other flavors, as prolonged storage may cause loss of potency. </p>
<p>Every morning, on an empty stomach, mix a blend of the rice soup with 1-2 handfuls of the powder in a silver container until well combined, then cook until it resembles porridge, adding 2 tablespoons of white sugar. If you do not have a silver pot, a clay pot will suffice, but avoid using copper or iron pots. </p>

<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescription&quot; states: Those under forty often indulge freely. Once one surpasses forty, one immediately feels a decline in vigor. When decline sets in, numerous ailments arise; if left untreated for a long time, it leads to irreparable damage. Hence, Peng Zu said: Healing one person with another can lead to true understanding. Therefore, by the age of forty, one must be familiar with the techniques of the bedroom. The methods of these techniques are very accessible, yet few can practice them. The principle is to govern oneself like one would with ten people in a single evening, being cautious and discreet; this is the essence of the bedroom skills. Additionally, if one continuously consumes medicine throughout the seasons, vitality multiplies, and wisdom is renewed daily. However, the purpose of these practices is not to seek indulgence or fleeting pleasure; rather, it is to maintain moderation for the sake of preserving life. It is not merely for strengthening oneself through lustful pursuits or to indulge desires but to replenish and alleviate ailments. This is the subtle meaning of the bedroom techniques. Therefore, those under forty who take bedroom herbs often encounter speedy misfortunes—exercise caution! Thus, those who have not yet reached forty are not suitable to discuss matters of the bedroom.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>Desires have not yet ceased, and combined with the consumption of tonics and medicines, one quickly exhausts their vitality within half a year, leading to a depletion of essence and bringing one closer to death. Young people must be particularly cautious. For those over forty, maintaining and nurturing one&#39;s vitality without excessive consumption can prevent aging. Additionally, consuming mica can effectively cure illnesses and prolong life. Those over forty should avoid laxatives; frequently taking tonics is preferable. </p>
<p>In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor took 1,200 maidens and ascended to immortality, while common people lose their life over one maiden. Those who understand this are clearly far removed from ignorance. The wise man knows that consuming too many maidens is not beneficial. </p>
<p>A woman does not have to possess beautiful looks but should be youthful, unblemished by childbirth, and have more muscle. If fortunate and wealthy, one should choose a woman with fine hair, distinct black and white eyes, a supple body, soft bones, smooth skin, and harmonious and gentle speech; her limbs and joints should be well-fleshed but not overly large in bone. There should be no fine hairs on her body or underarms; having fine, soft hair is undesirable. </p>
<p>Conversely, traits like a messy hairdo, a thick neck, a loud voice and large mouth, high nose and prominent teeth, murky eyes, facial hair, large bones, yellowish skin with little flesh, an abundance of coarse hair, and reversed hair growth are all negative signs. Such traits can steal one’s life and shorten longevity.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>In the way of approaching women, one should not engage when the energy is unresponsive and the yang energy is weak; instead, one must first gradually harmonize, allowing the spirit and intention to connect deeply for a long while before achieving the yin energy. The yin energy must be pushed, firm yet gentle. It is said that one should be weak yet receptive, strong yet resolute in action. Movements should be slow and deliberate, with emotions stirred yet held back. One should not cast oneself forward recklessly, for this can upset the internal organs and lead to various ailments. Engaging in a few careful encounters allows for the healing of ailments, leading to increased longevity, and one can draw nearer to immortality. There’s no necessity for strict numerical patterns; if one can connect repeatedly without excessive release, they will achieve longevity. </p>
<p>If one has many partners, they can gather energy. The method of gathering energy is simply to connect deeply without movement, allowing the energy to rise and warm up for a long time. By matching the breath with the mouth, one draws in the woman&#39;s energy and swallows it. Movements can be slow and deliberate, stopping when emotions stir. Breathe slowly, close the eyes, relax the body, allowing for greater strength, thus being able to engage with other women as well. By alternating partners, one can gain many benefits. </p>
<p>If one frequently engages with one woman, the yin energy weakens and the benefits diminish. The yang pathway follows the nature of fire, while the yin follows that of water. Water can extinguish fire, and the yin can also dissipate the yang. If engaged in excessively, the yin energy becomes overly depleted. As the yang weakens, the gains will not compensate for the losses.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>If one can engage with twelve women without experiencing ejaculation, they will not grow old and will possess beauty. If one engages with ninety-three women while remaining firm, they would live for ten thousand years. Generally, if the essence is scarce, one becomes ill; if it is exhausted, one dies. One must not neglect this and must be cautious. If one engages frequently and then ejaculates, the essence will grow, preventing weakness. If one does not engage frequently, but ejaculates immediately, there will be no benefit. The essence lost through ejaculation will naturally regenerate, but it is not as quick as the benefit gained from frequent intercourse without ejaculation. When a person is accustomed to sexual union, they should often use their nose to inhale deeply and exhale lightly; this will naturally enhance their vitality. The culmination of the union creates heat, which gathers energy. By using three parts of calamus powder and grinding coarse white millet flour to keep it dry, it both strengthens and prevents sores from forming. Those who desire to ejaculate should close their mouths, open their eyes, hold their breath, grip their hands firmly, and balance movements up and down. They should constrict the nose to take in air, constrict the lower body, and pull in the abdomen while relaxing the spine. Quickly, with the middle finger of the left hand, press against the Huiyin point, exhale long and deeply. By repeatedly grinding the teeth a thousand times, the essence will replenish the brain, ensuring longevity. If the essence is released inappropriately, it will harm the spirit. The &quot;Book of Immortality&quot; states: to attain eternal life, one should first play and drink the jade nectar with women. The jade nectar refers to the saliva in the mouth.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>To move between man and woman, use the left hand to hold. Focus on the丹田 (dantian) within, where there is red energy inside, yellow outside, and white surrounding it, transforming into the sun and moon, circulating within the dantian, both merging into one throat. Hold the breath deeply inward without letting it escape, just gently breathe in and out. If feelings arise and seem ready to emerge, quickly retreat them. This is not something the wise can achieve easily. The dantian is located three inches below the navel. The &quot;mud wall&quot; is in the head opposite the two eyes. Directly enter within, imagine creating the sun and moon, envision merging them into a form of about three inches in diameter, where the two halves become one, referred to as the sun and moon coming together. Even while breathing in and out, continue to think of the creator; do not cease this thought as it is beneficial. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is said that both genders share the path of immortality. Deep within, do not expel essence, focus on the red shape in the belly, about the size of an egg, slowly breathe in and out, and when emotions move, retreat. Over a day or night, this can be accomplished many times to stabilize, promoting longevity. Both partners should quiet their minds and think together, which can be intensified. The method of embracing a woman allows for up to twelve emissions in a month, and twenty-four in a year, potentially leading to two hundred years of life, maintaining vitality and free from illness. If combined with herbs, it may lead to eternal life.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>At twenty years old, one should release once every four days; at thirty, once every eight days; at forty, once every sixteen days; at fifty, once every twenty days; at sixty, one should refrain from release. If the body is still strong, one can release once a month. Generally, if a person&#39;s strength is naturally abundant, it should not be suppressed for too long. Failing to release for a long time can lead to boils and sores. If someone over sixty is strong and cannot engage in intimacy for several weeks, and feels an ordinary calmness, it is acceptable to refrain. </p>
<p>In the past, during the Zhengguan era, there was an old man over seventy who approached me and said: &quot;In the past few days, my yang energy has been increasing, and I wish to sleep with my wife during the day; all spring activities have been fulfilled. I wonder if this is good or bad for an old man?&quot; I replied: &quot;This is very ominous. Have you not heard of the depletion of fire? When the oil is about to run out, it will first darken and then brighten; when the brightness stops, it will perish. Now, you are in the twilight of your years; you should long cease to engage your desires. Suddenly, if your spring feelings surge intensely, is that not abnormal? I am worried for you! Please take care!&quot; </p>
<p>After four weeks, he fell ill and died. This was the consequence of his negligence. Such situations are not rare. I recount this to caution others in the future. Therefore, those who are adept at self-care must be careful to suppress any excessive yang energy and not allow their desires to lead them astray. If they can manage it once, they can diminish the fire once and increase the oil once.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>If one cannot restrain themselves and indulges excessively, it is akin to a fire that is about to extinguish; furthermore, if one continues to deplete their essence, how can they not deeply guard against the affliction? In youth, one does not understand; even when they do, they cannot trust or act upon it. It is only in old age that they come to realize, but by then it is too late, and sickness becomes hard to nurture. If one takes precautions later in life, they may still extend their years. Those who are young and vigorous yet can practice the path will quickly attain immortality. </p>
<p>Someone asks: Is it permissible to conserve one&#39;s essence and focus on singularity before reaching sixty? The answer is: No. A man cannot be without a woman, nor a woman without a man. Without a woman, desire is stirred; with desire stirred, the spirit is fatigued; when the spirit is fatigued, lifespan is diminished. If one can genuinely think of nothing at all, then that is the best way to achieve longevity; however, such a state is extremely rare. To forcefully suppress and close off leads to difficulties in maintaining it, causing one to leak essence and urine, resulting in ailments akin to spirit interaction, diminishing one drastically.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Medical Texts&quot; states that the method of refinement for men thrice is as follows: In the heavens and earth, there is closure; all things are enveloped. Men and women are secretive, leading to the proliferation of offspring. The method of concealment is not to be transmitted; if shared, heaven will surely punish the unworthy.</p>
<p>&quot;The act of closing&quot; refers to the meaning of sealing and storing. In nature, during winter, the vital energy is transformed, being stored and not manifested; in a person, it means to firmly close one&#39;s essence so that nothing is carelessly leaked. Hence, the multitude of things and offspring abounds.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>The mechanism of these two principles, their intricate transformations in the flow of existence, connects heaven and humanity in resonance, generating a single path that enables one to reach an understanding instinctively; it is beyond what can be articulated to those of lower discernment. The left and right hands connect with the heart, and the inner fire can be reached in the dark. The master and guest are differentiated and interact with each other. </p>
<p>This means that the palm of the hand connects with the heart channel. When the right hand’s palm rubs against the left heart, the left is the master and the right is the guest; conversely, when the left palm rubs the right heart, the right is the master and the left is the guest. This is the technique of circulating fire around the navel. The heart fire returns to the navel, connecting with the kidneys; when harmonized without dispersing, the interaction of the two oppositions leads to the solidification of the true essence, and the spirit of the valleys can respond. The spirit of the valleys is formless yet can respond, transmitting sensations effectively. When the spirit of the valleys is strong, the sword’s energy is vigorous; when it is weak, the sword’s energy falters. This mutual resonance between male and female ignites the flow of vital energy, revealing the wonders of nature.</p>
<p>Use the heavy Yin 68 times, and one must know to subtract 10, reducing to 47. </p>
<p>This refers to the number of rubs. For example, one round is 68, two rounds is 58, three rounds is 48, four rounds is 38, and five rounds is 28, representing a ten count reduction; five rounds decrease to the number of 47. When it reaches seven, eight, or nine rounds, it concludes at 28 rounds. </p>
<p>Do not let the timing exceed the necessary separation.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>The heart, detached, corresponds to the kidneys when lowered; one must avoid excessive heat from affecting the essence. Each stroke conducts warmth into the lower abdomen; the old yang within increases in cycles. It is known that each breath integrates into the count of nine, culminating in a total of eighty-one pure yang breaths. </p>
<p>This means that with each stroke, one presses the hand against the abdomen, allowing warmth to enter. Breathing through the nose, with each cycle taking nine breaths, the count increases: one round equals nine breaths, two rounds eighteen, three rounds twenty-seven, and so forth, with nine rounds gradually reaching eighty-one breaths. The number nine applies to pure yang; thus, nine times nine yields the pure yang diagram. The heart fire relates to yin, thus the strokes require strong yin; the kidney energy relates to yang, so the breaths should focus on old yang. The method is to enter a room after midnight, sit in a cross-legged position for a time, calming the heart and stabilizing the breath. With the left hand placed palm up on the left knee and the right hand rubbing it sixty-eight times; the left palm then rests on the abdomen while the right hand presses down on the left. Breathing through the nose for nine breaths, one must focus on directing the breath back to the abdomen; this constitutes the first cycle.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>Then, with the right hand raised and placed on the right knee, use the left hand to rub it, reduce ten times, which makes it fifty-eight times. Then, place the right hand on the dantian (the center of the body), with the left hand pressing down on the right hand, breathing in through the nose and increasing nine breaths to make a total of eighteen breaths, using intention to focus and allow the breaths to return to the dantian; this is the second stage. Afterward, alternate hands pressing up and down, with the same intention, but reduce by ten and increase by nine for a total of nine stages. After doing this for forty-nine days, when the vital energy is sufficient, one may then take the cauldron.</p>
<p>The four seasons are called spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and the twenty-four solar terms are the basis of life and transformation. With each inhalation and exhalation, one deeply captures the energy, perpetually in a cycle as Heaven does not go awry.</p>
<p>This practice in the chamber speaks of capturing and taking the energy from a woman. The numbers three, five, seven, and nine are all odd and refer to the moments of union with a woman; however, when reaching the number four, everything penetrates deeply within. One inhales through the nose and draws up through the flanks to capture the energy of the woman, representing her energy overcoming mine. The cycle repeats, whereby once three, five, seven, and nine are completed, one begins again from three. </p>
<p>The number of Heaven in a cycle is three hundred sixty, and three, five, seven, and nine total twenty-four, coinciding with the twenty-four solar terms. During union, first perform the upward movement six times, each cycle being twenty-four, thus totaling four hundred forty. Afterward, perform the union nine times, each cycle also being twenty-four, resulting in two hundred sixteen, making a total of three hundred sixty, which aligns with the number of Heaven; this is the subtle principle. </p>
<p>The upward union signifies the harmony of Heaven and Earth, the duality of male and female, and the reciprocity of their actions.</p>
<p>Water in the Kan trigrams is ever-victorious, while fire in the Li trigrams can easily be extinguished.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>Immortal grass takes precedence in spring, obtaining the cycles of yin and yang. Brew it strongly and immerse it, following the immortal formula. Only when离火, the fire of separation, is desired to be kindled, should nothing enter the mouth to swallow. Rinse without sound, spit without decision. Warm the seat and fetch the urinal, gently let out the liver fire. The heart, lazy like a sunbathing toad, has a hollow spine that falls seven times in total. Achieving success counters thousands, let not the true essence leak in vain.</p>
<p>[The fire of separation is easily ignited; this refers to how a man’s essence easily stirs. When it is about to stir, one should hold strongly brewed warm tea in the mouth, rinse slowly, and spit it out carefully, ensuring not to make any sound. Also, use a night pot to relieve liver fire; position oneself like a toad basking in the sun, with both feet and hands on the bedding, arching the spine upwards and falling seven times, then the essence will rise and not dissipate.]</p>
<p>One must calculate the坎, as the water tide arises. When the moon waxes, I retreat and cast; when the moon wanes, I advance to receive. The methods of one and two must not be neglected. Additionally, there is a phrase that must be spoken: &quot;Left is for the male, right is for the female, intersecting at the shoulders.&quot;</p>
<p>[This states that when encountering a woman born under the heavenly water, one must wait for the tide to recede for three days before engaging in union. The one and two methods refer to techniques for seizing energy. &quot;Left is male and right is female at the shoulders&quot; is a secret for conceiving males. A woman carrying a child has the male on the left and the female on the right. When a man is to release his essence, it must be directed slightly to the left towards the woman.]<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>With a hand, one strikes the left shoulder of the woman, causing her left qi to rise sharply, and the essence that enters the left side will lead to the conception of a boy. This is the method for cultivating many sons in the triple refinement practice. The six refinements lead to longevity, while the nine refinements allow one to transcend.</p>
<p>The operation of the yin and yang energies at the gate of the kan and li hexagrams encapsulates the vastness of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth give birth to humanity, and the diversity of things is also encompassed within this. Therefore, the fire of li is easily kindled, and the water of kan is easily depleted. When yin and yang interact chaotically, true essence is not stabilized, and the valley spirit becomes unresponsive. This triple refinement method is described in the Book of Changes as the essence of heaven and earth, wherein all things are transformed into purity. Is this not the unity of heaven and humanity?</p>
<p>The method of collecting yin: when the tree weakens, it is nourished by the earth; when yang declines, yin supplements it. One must carefully nurture the original qi and not lose measure. In commentary it is noted that there is no sentimentality. When a tree reaches decay, it is still nourished by dust to regain vitality; anew, it sprouts tender branches, allowing even an old tree to achieve longevity. Thus, using thoughtful reasoning, yang weakens while yin supplements, making this approach suitable. Weak yang is supplemented by a little yin without loss, drawing in the essence and fluids to restore vitality, resulting in a rejuvenated appearance.</p>
<p>For boys and girls, as their vital essence remains unscattered, and their original energy is still harmonious, encountering such cultivation yields a hundredfold benefit. It is crucial to avoid letting one&#39;s original qi flow away.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Chushi Yishu&quot; states: The Princess of Jianping, Lady Ji, and others are all beautiful but without children. They selected good families for unmarried girls to enter the court, yet still had no children. It was asked: Is there a way to obtain sons? Cheng replied: For a couple, they must be of appropriate age; while a boy may be skilled at sixteen, he should marry at thirty; a girl may reach maturity at fourteen, but she should marry at twenty. They all desire the completion of yin and yang energy before they unite; thus, they conceive, give birth, and raise children, who are strong and live long. If a girl has not reached adulthood, her maturity is just beginning, already attracting male energy; her yin energy dissipates early, is incomplete, and suffers damage. Therefore, they unite but do not conceive, conceive but do not give birth, and raise children who are weak and short-lived. This is why the king has no sons. However, some women give birth only to girls, while others give birth only to boys. If the king can indeed seek many women who bear sons and plan a residence for them, there is a way to have sons. The king said: Good. Not long after, six sons were born. When the old yang encounters the young yin, and the old yin encounters the young yang, there is also a way to have children.</p>
<p>&quot;The Shenjing Tongkao&quot; states: The king took the immortal elixir of ten thousand spirits for two months and subsequently conceived three offspring. Three servants who took it all became pregnant. One of them was sixty years old, and another was fifty-two, having long since given up on the idea of childbirth, yet still became pregnant after two years, which is indeed unusual. In Zouping County, there was a man who was pure and had no children; after taking it, he fathered a son.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Natural Theory of Ancient Times</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What is the reason that some who are old still have children? Qibo replied: This is because their heavenly lifespan has exceeded the norm, their vital energy flows smoothly, and there is an abundance of kidney essence. Even though they have children, males may not exceed eighty, and females may not exceed seventy; thus, the essence of heaven and earth is entirely depleted. 【Note: The heavenly lifespan exceeds the normal limit, indicating a richness of the innate essence. The vital energy flowing smoothly shows that the acquired vitality remains open, which is why there can still be children despite the depletion of heaven and earth&#39;s essence, especially at the numbers of seventy or eighty.】 The Emperor asked: Is it possible for those who cultivate the Way to have children if they are already over a hundred years old? Qibo replied: Those who cultivate the Way can delay aging and maintain their physical form, so even though they live long lives, they can still bear children. 【Note: Only those who cultivate the Way can transcend the numerical limits of yin and yang established by heaven and earth.】<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Thousand Gold Formulas</h3>
<p><strong>Auspicious Days for Conception</strong></p>
<p>In the methodology of controlling the intercourse, one should avoid days of the Bing and Ding, as well as the full moon, new moon, heavy winds, heavy rain, dense fog, extreme cold, extreme heat, thunder and lightning, darkened skies, eclipses of the sun and moon, rainbows, and earthquakes. If intercourse occurs on such days, it will harm the spirit of the person, bringing bad fortune. It will significantly harm the male, causing illness in the female. The offspring will most likely be afflicted with insanity, stubbornness, muteness, deafness, blindness, numerous ailments, short lives, lack of filial piety, and cruelty.</p>
<p>Additionally, one should avoid engaging in intercourse beneath the light of celestial bodies, within temples and Buddhist monasteries, near wells, kitchens, or latrines, and beside graves or coffins. If one engages in intercourse according to the methods prescribed, then there will be blessings, virtues, and wise and good beings who will take root in the womb, leading to harmonious character and endeavors, daily expansion of the family’s fortune, and gathering of auspicious omens. However, if done improperly, unworthy and foolish beings will enter the womb, resulting in dangerous traits in the parents, failed endeavors, familial decline, and frequent misfortunes. Even if the offspring grow up, they may lead to the ruin of the family and country.</p>
<p>The response of good and bad fortune is akin to echoes; it is a natural principle that should not be ignored. If one desires children, they should wait until the woman has completed her menstrual cycle by a day, three days, or five days, choosing auspicious days resembling kings and favorable lunar mansions, and during the energetic hours after midnight for conception. This will ensure male offspring who are long-lived, virtuous, and of high status. If conception occurs two days, four days, or six days after menstruation ends, it will definitely result in female offspring. After six days, one should not attempt conception, as it will not yield children nor produce a person.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Miscellaneous Prohibitions</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: When a person is angry, and their blood and energy are unsettled, engaging in sexual intercourse can lead to the onset of carbuncles. One should also not endure a full bladder during intercourse, as it can cause painful urination, discomfort in the genitals, and pallor. Traveling and arriving at someone else&#39;s quarters exhausted can lead to five kinds of labor that weaken a man and cause infertility. Furthermore, if a woman engages in intercourse before her menstrual cycle has completely ended, it may lead to illness and white spots on the skin. Mercury should not come near the genitals, as it can cause contraction. The fats of deer and boar should also be avoided, as they can lead to impotence.</p>
<h3>Discussions on Sexual Restoration</h3>
<p>Someone asked: The &quot;Thousand Ducat Formulas&quot; contains methods for sexual restoration, are these permissible? I responded: The transmission states: Fortune and misfortune, regrets and resentments arise from actions, and thus human illnesses also arise from actions. When actions intensify, they can lead to illness and death. Life in humans is characterized by the heart as fire above and the kidney as water below; water can rise while fire can descend. This rise and fall has no end, thus life persists. Water is still in nature, while fire is dynamic; the dynamic is easy while the still is difficult. The sages never ceased to speak about this. Confucians teach: “Correct the heart, focus the heart, nourish the heart,” which serves to guard against the reckless movement of fire. Physicians teach tranquility and emptiness, maintaining one’s spirit inwardly, which also serves to restrain the reckless movements of fire.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

How could there be a cruel blaze or a wild force? In the &quot;I Ching,&quot; the image of the lake is associated with the young girl. Lake signifies harmony, encountering the young man which brings mutual attraction. Attraction is an unconscious feeling. The mountain represents stopping.

Upon reflecting on the intention of the &quot;Thousand Golds,&quot; those in their prime who indulge are like tranquil water, unlike the stillness of the sun, hence the methods in the chamber are established as aids for enhancement. This applies to those who are strong and calm against an enemy, remaining unmoved. If one lacks the heart of a sage or the essence of an immortal, it is difficult to change. Women adapt to water; men adapt to fire. Water can control fire; one delights in giving, the other delights in receiving—this is the principle of nature. If one approaches the chamber merely for enhancement, it often leads to harm.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Great indeed! The mystery of life lies in the interplay of yin and yang! The vital principle of yin and yang, which gives rise to all things without cease, is based in the cosmos; within humans, it is rooted in essence and blood. Thus, although one possesses the subtlety of the Dao, the potential for cultivation and application actually resides there. Observed from the perspective of the constant, even the most foolish of men and women can understand this. However, when one considers the variable aspects, even the wise and benevolent may encounter limitations. Therefore, the essence (ti) is yin and yang, essence and blood; the application (yong) is the harmonious interaction of yin and yang. When essence and blood are sufficient and they harmonize in due time, this is the constant state. What the foolish can understand is merely the principle of nature. When essence and blood are deficient and they fail to harmonize at the right time, this is the variable state. What the wise and benevolent cannot grasp is merely a state of adversity.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The way it is in its usual state, I already know it does not rely on being expressed in words. However, when it changes, how could one not discern it? A sage who understands the Way must surely recognize the moments of change and apply his intentions accordingly. This is the principle, and the wise philosophers have understood it, allowing even the foolish to grasp its meaning. I will explain in detail.</p>
<p>The Book of Changes states: &quot;Heaven and Earth are harmonious; all things transform into their essence. The union of male and female creates life.&quot; It also says: &quot;The harmony of yin and yang brings virtue, and the essence of hardness and softness has form. It is precisely said that alone, the yang does not give birth, and alone, the yin does not come into being.&quot; This suggests that the relationship between husband and wife is akin to that of Heaven and Earth. The way of Heaven and Earth is such that when yin and yang are in harmony, all things flourish; the way of husband and wife is similarly that when yin and yang are in harmony, men and women give life.</p>
<p>If there is even a slight deficiency in the male essence or the female blood, the conception of the fetus cannot occur. Thus, those who wish to have children must first examine whether their wife&#39;s menstrual cycle is regular.</p>
<p>The menstrual cycle is the norm, like the sun and moon, which arrive on schedule and depart on schedule, without fail; hence it is called the menstrual cycle. Sometimes, there are irregularities: it may come too early or too late, might occur twice in one month or once every other month; there may be cases of blockage where it does not occur, or it may come too frequently and not stop; it may be accompanied by pain before or after, or may have a different color—black, purple, pale; there may be white discharge, excessive leucorrhea, or abnormal fluid. These all indicate an imbalance in blood and qi. Such cases must be diagnosed and treated with medicine accordingly. </p>
<p>Moreover, understanding the ailments of men is also essential.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are deficiencies, they may include kidney deficiency with slippery essence, cold and clear essence; sometimes, one is unable to maintain firmness when faced with matters, and when firm, it flows but does not shoot; there may be night sweats and nocturnal emissions, as well as turbid urine and difficult urination; there may be weakness in the waist that prevents turning or swaying, and a penchant for lust that results in yin deficiency; there are those with labor heat and those with empty cold, all of which indicate insufficient essence and qi. Such cases must be treated according to symptoms to replenish and benefit. A man must be free from these ailments before he can rightly blame the woman. If such conditions exist, they indeed are the man&#39;s responsibility. How can he place the blame on the woman? If the woman is well, there is little more that can be done. When a woman&#39;s meridians are regulated and a man&#39;s true essence is sufficient, then yin and yang are in harmony, and qi and blood are balanced, thus no ailments arise and offspring can be conceived. If the child is also healthy, what difficulty is there in succession? Once yin and yang are harmonized, proper methods should also be employed, and human efforts cannot be neglected. The saying goes: &quot;In the span of thirty days, count two and a half days; those of twenty-eight or nine must be mindful.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This passage discusses the timing of conception in relation to a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle. It states that when a woman&#39;s menstruation has just ended, and her body is ready for fertilization, it is an opportune moment for conception. During this time, the uterus is open, making it ideal for receiving sperm to create a pregnancy, and human efforts should align with this natural timing to preserve the wonders of creation. If this key period is missed, the uterus will close and will not receive the fertilized egg.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are specific outcomes based on the timing of intercourse after menstruation. If intercourse occurs one, three, or five days after menstruation, a male child is likely to be conceived; if it occurs two, four, or six days afterward, a female child is more likely. Additionally, the text explains the interaction of Yin (female) and Yang (male) forces in conception: if the Yin energy (blood) arrives first and the Yang energy (semen) comes later, the Yang becomes dominant, resulting in a male child. Conversely, if the Yang energy arrives first, followed by the Yin, the Yin becomes dominant, leading to a female child. This highlights the critical balance between these two forces in determining the sex of the child.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of Yin Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Remaining Discussions on Knowledge and Investigation&quot; states: Yang is often in excess, while Yin is often insufficient. Qi is usually abundant, while blood is often lacking. The excess Yang is not merely referring to the primordial Yang of the heart but denotes various forms of fire. There are two types of fire: the heart represents the sovereign fire, which is the correct and singular fire of the five elements; the kidney represents the ministerial fire, which is the fire of deviation and disorder. Whenever there is movement, the ministerial fire burns along, consuming the true Yin and depleting the essence and marrow. The texts say: &quot;Strengthening the water ruler to control the Yang light&quot; refers to this. It also says: For those with insufficient form, warm them with Qi; for those with insufficient essence, replenish them with flavor. To warm means to nourish and harmonize the Qi to overcome movement with stillness, as the texts say: &quot;Those who labor should be warmed.&quot; To flavor means medicinal flavor. The texts state: &quot;The birth of Yin fundamentally lies in the five flavors.&quot; Thus, it is evident that replenishing Yin is necessary for everyone, being essential from youth to old age. Danxi stated: &quot;Those who become ill due to fire account for eighteen out of ten; those who fall ill without the influence of fire are very rare.&quot; Therefore, fire is an unrooted element; within a person&#39;s body, in the five organs and six bowels, nothing is absent, and only the prominence of Yin can subdue it. Zhao Jizong argued: &quot;Since Yin is inherently insufficient, there is no need to replenish it; if one replenishes what is lacking to the point of excess, it could lead to the harm of overabundance.&quot;<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ah! This is the thought of Zhao Yi! If the help is insufficient, it must be supplemented; if there is deficiency, it should be addressed naturally. What is real is real, what is empty is empty; remedy the deep-rooted ailments. If one is in danger and does not hold on, or if one falls and is not supported, then what use is that assistance? The classics state: Those who suffer from cold yet become hot must take in the yin. Therefore, when there is a deficiency in yin, it leads to the rise of empty heat, causing essence, blood, and fluids to dry up, resulting in symptoms of night sweats, cloudy urine, and internal heat due to exhaustion. The treatment for this deficiency of water must include yin-replenishing agents, as well as those that nourish the blood, harmonize the interior, enrich yin, and reduce heat. Furthermore, it is said: To tonify the kidneys, one does not necessarily need to do so with cold; strengthening the yin of the kidneys can still manage heat. This certainly does not entail relying solely on the knowledge of tonifying yin, but rather, one should recognize what is fundamentally essential for strengthening yin. Otherwise, one might often see that bitter cold harms the stomach, clinging to a single method without authority, endangering oneself, while wishing to have children—how could that be possible? Thus, the yin-replenishing agents, even if there is no ailment, can still be taken regularly, so to speak, treating the root slowly. Additionally, by calming the mind and easing worries to nourish, frequent consumption of strengthening agents like Jian Gan and Ban Long will likely yield the desired result in progeny—can it be observed in the palms? How many people, lacking insight, readily believe in superficial remedies, hastily consuming acrid, hot, fragrant, and drying agents to boost yang—this is nothing short of trying to use fire to control fire, throwing stones to rescue someone from drowning, or using firewood to put out a fire. How different is this! Wise gentlemen, may you take caution!<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Regulating Menstrual Seeds</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, the Heavenly essence arrives, the Ren vessel opens, and the Chong vessel is abundant, menstruation occurs regularly, and then she can conceive. The Ren vessel governs the womb; when it is open, it signifies the well-being of the vagina. The Chong vessel is the sea of blood; when it is abundant, both vital energy and blood flourish. When a woman’s kidney energy is strong, and the Ren and Chong vessels circulate smoothly, like the waxing and waning of the moon, menstruation will occur at regular intervals, indicating regulation, and if she engages in intercourse, she can conceive. Otherwise, irregularities occur three to five times, which is referred to as lack of regulation. Lack of regulation can lead to numerous ailments, even unto incurable conditions; how can one discuss pregnancy then? It is stated: Diseases of the two Yang affecting the heart and spleen can create difficult hidden paths. If a woman does not menstruate, it leads to symptoms such as wind dissipating or breath disturbances, and can result in death without remedy. Moreover, since the heart belongs to Yang and governs blood, while the spleen supports blood in circulating energy, if menstruation is obstructed, it may not only be due to insufficient heart energy, but also from worries affecting the spleen, causing exhaustion and inadequate digestion. This leads to weakened sustenance of lung metal, and kidney water fails to nourish. The menstrual blood and bodily fluids gradually dry up, leading to irregularities of three to five cycles, eventually resulting in complete closure and depletion. Such internal heat and bone steaming can create difficult-to-treat conditions, resulting in severe outcomes.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, nurturing the heart leads to the generation of blood, and strengthening the spleen allows for the distribution of qi. When these two achieve harmony, qi flows freely and blood circulates smoothly, making the regulation of menstruation essential; thus, there is no cause for concern. Moreover, during menstruation, one must protect themselves as during childbirth, avoiding excessive labor, refraining from bathing, and being cautious of extreme cold, heat, joy, and anger. Any disruption can lead to illness. </p>
<p>For treatment methods: if there is stagnation of qi and deficiency of blood, with symptoms like tidal fever and jaundice, while menstruation is irregular, use formulas like Dan Gui San and Xiang Fu Wan; for qi deficiency with blood heat, arriving too early and being excessive, treat with Zhen Jing Tang and Gu Jing Wan; if menstruation is delayed with abdominal pain, use Cu Jing Tang and Hong Hua San; for dampness and phlegm causing numbness, use Zhu Fu Wan to dry it out. Additionally, for issues relating to deficiency and excess, cold and heat, consult the pulse for details. How can there be unregulated menstruation and issues with conception?</p>
<p>According to traditional teachings, a man must have sufficient qi and robust essence, while a woman should have a well-regulated menstruation and ample blood before pregnancy can be expected. Hence, both partners should seek this balance. This text elaborates on the path to pregnancy but does not delve into the regulation of menstruation, as that has already been thoroughly covered in women&#39;s medical literature. Therefore, it will not be repeated here.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>A Discussion on the Use of Seed and Strong Yang Heating Medicine</p>
<p>In life, there is joy in nature, joy in power, and joy in a healthy body. The joy in nature is like spring in all seasons, where everything shares the same essence. Even in a humble dwelling or amidst hardship and difficulties, one can still find joy. The mountains, streams, winds, and moons—with me here, I am the host; the wood, stone, birds, and fish become all my friends. Why be indulgent in passivity or give in to lewd desires? Even the smallest creation has nothing to hold onto for frivolity. As for the joy of power and the joy of health that resists aging, only those who are truly blessed can possess both. The source of wealth and longevity comes from two paths of fortune: the youthfulness’s natural simplicity is the foundation for longevity, even if it lacks brilliance; youthful cunning and vitality, while valuable, may seem overly refined. Between these two lies a balance, half given by heaven and half earned by oneself. After striving, one must realize that this body is entrusted by heaven, and thus ought to preserve vitality and spirit in gratitude for heavenly favor.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a woman loves fully and a man delights completely, exhausting what one naturally possesses, while relying on medicinal potions and demanding quick results, this brings forth unwise little people who master the tricks to harm others in hopes of swift gains. Though past generations have made similar mistakes, today&#39;s situation is more severe. The sign of peace and harmony has turned into urgency; the course of the world has been transformed by fiery enthusiasm, and with hasty remedies, how can one avoid destruction? This path is well understood by the practitioners of traditional medicine, but scholars and officials are reluctant to engage deeply with it. </p>
<p>It is said that the way of yin and yang hinges on harmony. When they are discordant, it is like having spring without autumn or winter without summer. Therefore, aligning them together is called the way of the sage. This segment of scripture has been buried by earlier commentaries, yet it clearly states that the sage understands the principles of interaction between men and women, and that such a union relies on the secrecy of yang energy, which must be conserved and not leaked. </p>
<p>Thus, yin and yang must be harmonized; a spring without an autumn signifies a lack of yin, and a winter without a summer signifies a lack of yang. Therefore, the sage merely adjusts the extremes to return to harmony, thus establishing the principles of interaction. The sage embodies the vital essence of great harmony and holds life within. </p>
<p>When I observe tuning strings and striking bells or gongs, although these interactions can harmonize the emotional dispositions of people, one must take into account their own vital energy. Similarly, rituals and music cultivate civility, and kindness and righteousness flourish—though the prosperities of the people are abundant, the same should apply to one&#39;s own descendants. </p>
<p>Thus, for those who seek to widely propagate their lineage, the principles of medicinal use should focus only on pure and harmonious remedies, avoiding mixed and problematic ones that invite discord.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text mentions the four characters Yin, Ping, Yang, and Mi, which notably intertwine in meaning. It suggests that when Yin is balanced, without excess or deficiency, then Yang can achieve its hidden state without leaking out. This illustrates that the secrets of Yang are of utmost importance in the union of the sacred and divine. Furthermore, the secret of Yang must cede its authority to Yin, as Yang is rooted in Yin, and nurturing Yin is essential for the foundation of Yang.</p>
<p>However, people today, using harsh and potent medicines to drain their Yin, mistakenly believe they are nurturing Yang. They further exhaust their vitality through excessive sexual indulgence, gradually leading to the depletion of marrow and muscle, confusion of spirit, loss of energy, and even premature aging, yet they remain unaware of the harm caused by their medicine, which is indeed lamentable!</p>
<p>I once encountered a physician from Zhejiang, with the surname Song, who created large pills in the capital and distributed them to officials under the guise of being made from umbilical cord and fetal hair. In reality, they contained refined sulfur. Taking these pills caused a rapid and pleasing strengthening of Yang, but soon after, numerous dry illnesses emerged. Many elders in my hometown who fell victim to this can be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Recently, in a visit to Lucheng, I heard about Zhang Hongyi, a diligent official who suffered brain damage from ingesting red lead, and his condition has persisted day and night without cessation. Indeed, the brain is the sea of marrow; when the brain becomes heated, the marrow throughout the body rapidly depletes, and ultimately, until the heat is removed, the marrow is exhausted first, leading to weakness of the bones and difficulty in movement.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Visiting the old residence of Mr. Tianru in Louzhou, I noticed a thick yellow phlegm in my nose. The wooden walls were stained a deep yellow, and the color penetrated into the wood, which could not be scrubbed away. Inquiring about it, I learned that it was caused by taking hot medicinal seeds, which subsequently led to cold and minor ailments, ultimately resulting in a complete inability to rise. Alas! The heat in the brain had reached its extreme, producing yellow phlegm; the heat emitted from the nose could still permeate the wood. How could I not realize that when heat is excessive, it generates wind, yet I treated external symptoms without addressing the internal issues? What more can be said?</p>
<p>In my hometown, Mr. Liu Shilu took hot medicine and suffered from thirst; the physician Deng Jicun firmly insisted he take six-flavor Rehmannia Decoction for a thousand doses, which indeed proved effective. This treatment draws on the principle of harnessing the water lord to regulate the sun&#39;s energy. </p>
<p>Yuan Tiren from Gaoyou utilized experiential remedies based on the balance of yin and yang, reflecting the understanding of the harmony between yin and yang. This esteemed old physician, who was discerning about medicines, documented both approaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, alchemists used water from black lead, calling it divine water or gold elixir to deceive people. In cases of phlegm-fire diseases, initially, one might feel slightly better after the downward motion is achieved, yet they do not realize that the nature of lead is extremely drying, which further harms by depleting the yin. </p>
<p>There were also methods using steaming of the umbilical area, referred to as the practices of Pengzu. The umbilicus is the root of human life; combining strongly hot dispersive herbs like musk, sulfur, and aconite with burning moxa to steam, one might escape serious harm if not affected too much, but if it disturbs the vital energy without proper balance, it leads to complications or even a swift demise. </p>
<p>I heard the seasoned physician Mu Yungu from Louzhong once advised: “The method of steaming the umbilicus is harmful, not beneficial; it must never be practiced.” Such profound words!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ginseng Guardian Pill</strong> 【from <em>Essential Prescriptions</em>】</p>
<p>The heart contains blood, and the kidneys store essence. When essence and blood are abundant, hair remains unturned gray, complexion remains vibrant, one can still father children in old age, thereby prolonging life. Premature aging often results from the overuse of warming medicines that fail to nourish essence and blood. Among medicines that replenish essence and blood, the two Dihuang herbs (raw and cooked) stand out. People often know to take the two Dihuang herbs but fail to recognize that Asparagus Racemosus serves as a guide for their effects. Raw Dihuang can nourish heart blood, with Ophiopogon Japonicus directing this nourishment; cooked Dihuang can replenish kidney essence, with another Asparagus guiding this replenishment. These four ingredients work synergistically. The <em>Herbal Classic</em> additionally emphasizes Ginseng as a primary agent for harmonizing heart energy, hence its inclusion.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>120g raw Dihuang (soaked in wine)</li>
<li>120g cooked Dihuang (soaked in wine)</li>
<li>120g Ophiopogon (soaked in wine and heart removed)</li>
<li>120g Asparagus (soaked in wine and heart removed)</li>
<li>30g Ginseng</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind these into powder, mix with honey to form pills the size of a nut. Take 50 pills on an empty stomach, followed by warm wine or saline soup as desired. If phlegm is present, both types of Dihuang should be stir-fried with ginger juice to prevent blockage in the diaphragm.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p>This medicine can replenish all deficiencies and injuries, remedying the five labors and seven damages; its effects cannot be fully described. If four individuals jointly prepare a single dose and consume it, it can prolong life and increase descendants. The method involves four people collaborating to process one deer, and then they divide and consume it. After a year, they can prepare it again, and if they do this for four years, each person will end up with a whole deer. However, if one person tries to prepare a single dose alone, it may spoil over time, and the medicinal potency will diminish.</p>
<p>For preparing the deer, take one pair of deer (there&#39;s no restriction on gender), bind them and slaughter them, remove the fur and internal organs, then wash them clean and render them into a paste. The deer meat should be cooked thoroughly, sliced, and dried into powder; the skin should be mixed in with a basic broth to create a paste, which is then combined with the powdered medicine to form pills. The bones should be ground into powder and mixed together with the meat powder and medicinal powder, kneaded with glue.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chicken Head Porridge is remarkably effective for fertility. </p>
<p>For this, you will need:</p>

<li>1斗 of Qian Shi (gorgon fruit)</li>
<li>Dried lotus flesh, peeled and roasted</li>
<li>Fresh coix seeds</li>
<li>Dried yam, each 1升</li>

</ul>
<p>Grind these ingredients into a powder and mix them thoroughly. Store in a single container. In summer, use 3升 of Qian Shi as the main ingredient, reducing the other flavors, as prolonged storage may cause loss of potency. </p>
<p>Every morning, on an empty stomach, mix a blend of the rice soup with 1-2 handfuls of the powder in a silver container until well combined, then cook until it resembles porridge, adding 2 tablespoons of white sugar. If you do not have a silver pot, a clay pot will suffice, but avoid using copper or iron pots. </p>
<p>This can replace your morning porridge. Do not interrupt the intake; after six months, you will notice results. There is no need for additional medicinal herbs, as nurturing the spleen and stomach will strengthen the earth element, which can nourish all things. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescription&quot; states: Those under forty often indulge freely. Once one surpasses forty, one immediately feels a decline in vigor. When decline sets in, numerous ailments arise; if left untreated for a long time, it leads to irreparable damage. Hence, Peng Zu said: Healing one person with another can lead to true understanding. Therefore, by the age of forty, one must be familiar with the techniques of the bedroom. The methods of these techniques are very accessible, yet few can practice them. The principle is to govern oneself like one would with ten people in a single evening, being cautious and discreet; this is the essence of the bedroom skills. Additionally, if one continuously consumes medicine throughout the seasons, vitality multiplies, and wisdom is renewed daily. However, the purpose of these practices is not to seek indulgence or fleeting pleasure; rather, it is to maintain moderation for the sake of preserving life. It is not merely for strengthening oneself through lustful pursuits or to indulge desires but to replenish and alleviate ailments. This is the subtle meaning of the bedroom techniques. Therefore, those under forty who take bedroom herbs often encounter speedy misfortunes—exercise caution! Thus, those who have not yet reached forty are not suitable to discuss matters of the bedroom.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Desires have not yet ceased, and combined with the consumption of tonics and medicines, one quickly exhausts their vitality within half a year, leading to a depletion of essence and bringing one closer to death. Young people must be particularly cautious. For those over forty, maintaining and nurturing one&#39;s vitality without excessive consumption can prevent aging. Additionally, consuming mica can effectively cure illnesses and prolong life. Those over forty should avoid laxatives; frequently taking tonics is preferable. </p>
<p>In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor took 1,200 maidens and ascended to immortality, while common people lose their life over one maiden. Those who understand this are clearly far removed from ignorance. The wise man knows that consuming too many maidens is not beneficial. </p>
<p>A woman does not have to possess beautiful looks but should be youthful, unblemished by childbirth, and have more muscle. If fortunate and wealthy, one should choose a woman with fine hair, distinct black and white eyes, a supple body, soft bones, smooth skin, and harmonious and gentle speech; her limbs and joints should be well-fleshed but not overly large in bone. There should be no fine hairs on her body or underarms; having fine, soft hair is undesirable. </p>
<p>Conversely, traits like a messy hairdo, a thick neck, a loud voice and large mouth, high nose and prominent teeth, murky eyes, facial hair, large bones, yellowish skin with little flesh, an abundance of coarse hair, and reversed hair growth are all negative signs. Such traits can steal one’s life and shorten longevity.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the way of approaching women, one should not engage when the energy is unresponsive and the yang energy is weak; instead, one must first gradually harmonize, allowing the spirit and intention to connect deeply for a long while before achieving the yin energy. The yin energy must be pushed, firm yet gentle. It is said that one should be weak yet receptive, strong yet resolute in action. Movements should be slow and deliberate, with emotions stirred yet held back. One should not cast oneself forward recklessly, for this can upset the internal organs and lead to various ailments. Engaging in a few careful encounters allows for the healing of ailments, leading to increased longevity, and one can draw nearer to immortality. There’s no necessity for strict numerical patterns; if one can connect repeatedly without excessive release, they will achieve longevity. </p>
<p>If one has many partners, they can gather energy. The method of gathering energy is simply to connect deeply without movement, allowing the energy to rise and warm up for a long time. By matching the breath with the mouth, one draws in the woman&#39;s energy and swallows it. Movements can be slow and deliberate, stopping when emotions stir. Breathe slowly, close the eyes, relax the body, allowing for greater strength, thus being able to engage with other women as well. By alternating partners, one can gain many benefits. </p>
<p>If one frequently engages with one woman, the yin energy weakens and the benefits diminish. The yang pathway follows the nature of fire, while the yin follows that of water. Water can extinguish fire, and the yin can also dissipate the yang. If engaged in excessively, the yin energy becomes overly depleted. As the yang weakens, the gains will not compensate for the losses.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one can engage with twelve women without experiencing ejaculation, they will not grow old and will possess beauty. If one engages with ninety-three women while remaining firm, they would live for ten thousand years. Generally, if the essence is scarce, one becomes ill; if it is exhausted, one dies. One must not neglect this and must be cautious. If one engages frequently and then ejaculates, the essence will grow, preventing weakness. If one does not engage frequently, but ejaculates immediately, there will be no benefit. The essence lost through ejaculation will naturally regenerate, but it is not as quick as the benefit gained from frequent intercourse without ejaculation. When a person is accustomed to sexual union, they should often use their nose to inhale deeply and exhale lightly; this will naturally enhance their vitality. The culmination of the union creates heat, which gathers energy. By using three parts of calamus powder and grinding coarse white millet flour to keep it dry, it both strengthens and prevents sores from forming. Those who desire to ejaculate should close their mouths, open their eyes, hold their breath, grip their hands firmly, and balance movements up and down. They should constrict the nose to take in air, constrict the lower body, and pull in the abdomen while relaxing the spine. Quickly, with the middle finger of the left hand, press against the Huiyin point, exhale long and deeply. By repeatedly grinding the teeth a thousand times, the essence will replenish the brain, ensuring longevity. If the essence is released inappropriately, it will harm the spirit. The &quot;Book of Immortality&quot; states: to attain eternal life, one should first play and drink the jade nectar with women.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To move between man and woman, use the left hand to hold. Focus on the丹田 (dantian) within, where there is red energy inside, yellow outside, and white surrounding it, transforming into the sun and moon, circulating within the dantian, both merging into one throat. Hold the breath deeply inward without letting it escape, just gently breathe in and out. If feelings arise and seem ready to emerge, quickly retreat them. This is not something the wise can achieve easily. The dantian is located three inches below the navel. The &quot;mud wall&quot; is in the head opposite the two eyes. Directly enter within, imagine creating the sun and moon, envision merging them into a form of about three inches in diameter, where the two halves become one, referred to as the sun and moon coming together. Even while breathing in and out, continue to think of the creator; do not cease this thought as it is beneficial. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is said that both genders share the path of immortality. Deep within, do not expel essence, focus on the red shape in the belly, about the size of an egg, slowly breathe in and out, and when emotions move, retreat. Over a day or night, this can be accomplished many times to stabilize, promoting longevity. Both partners should quiet their minds and think together, which can be intensified. The method of embracing a woman allows for up to twelve emissions in a month, and twenty-four in a year, potentially leading to two hundred years of life, maintaining vitality and free from illness.

<p>After four weeks, he fell ill and died. This was the consequence of his negligence. Such situations are not rare. I recount this to caution others in the future.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one cannot restrain themselves and indulges excessively, it is akin to a fire that is about to extinguish; furthermore, if one continues to deplete their essence, how can they not deeply guard against the affliction? In youth, one does not understand; even when they do, they cannot trust or act upon it. It is only in old age that they come to realize, but by then it is too late, and sickness becomes hard to nurture. If one takes precautions later in life, they may still extend their years. Those who are young and vigorous yet can practice the path will quickly attain immortality. </p>
<p>Someone asks: Is it permissible to conserve one&#39;s essence and focus on singularity before reaching sixty? The answer is: No. A man cannot be without a woman, nor a woman without a man. Without a woman, desire is stirred; with desire stirred, the spirit is fatigued; when the spirit is fatigued, lifespan is diminished. If one can genuinely think of nothing at all, then that is the best way to achieve longevity; however, such a state is extremely rare. To forcefully suppress and close off leads to difficulties in maintaining it, causing one to leak essence and urine, resulting in ailments akin to spirit interaction, diminishing one drastically.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Medical Texts&quot; states that the method of refinement for men thrice is as follows: In the heavens and earth, there is closure; all things are enveloped. Men and women are secretive, leading to the proliferation of offspring. The method of concealment is not to be transmitted; if shared, heaven will surely punish the unworthy.</p>
<p>&quot;The act of closing&quot; refers to the meaning of sealing and storing. In nature, during winter, the vital energy is transformed, being stored and not manifested; in a person, it means to firmly close one&#39;s essence so that nothing is carelessly leaked. Hence, the multitude of things and offspring abounds.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

The left and right hands connect with the heart, and the inner fire can be reached in the dark. The master and guest are differentiated and interact with each other. </p>
<p>This means that the palm of the hand connects with the heart channel. When the right hand’s palm rubs against the left heart, the left is the master and the right is the guest; conversely, when the left palm rubs the right heart, the right is the master and the left is the guest. This is the technique of circulating fire around the navel. The heart fire returns to the navel, connecting with the kidneys; when harmonized without dispersing, the interaction of the two oppositions leads to the solidification of the true essence, and the spirit of the valleys can respond. The spirit of the valleys is formless yet can respond, transmitting sensations effectively. When the spirit of the valleys is strong, the sword’s energy is vigorous; when it is weak, the sword’s energy falters. This mutual resonance between male and female ignites the flow of vital energy, revealing the wonders of nature.</p>

The number nine applies to pure yang; thus, nine times nine yields the pure yang diagram. The heart fire relates to yin, thus the strokes require strong yin; the kidney energy relates to yang, so the breaths should focus on old yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>With a hand, one strikes the left shoulder of the woman, causing her left qi to rise sharply, and the essence that enters the left side will lead to the conception of a boy. This is the method for cultivating many sons in the triple refinement practice. The six refinements lead to longevity, while the nine refinements allow one to transcend.</p>
<p>The operation of the yin and yang energies at the gate of the kan and li hexagrams encapsulates the vastness of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth give birth to humanity, and the diversity of things is also encompassed within this. Therefore, the fire of li is easily kindled, and the water of kan is easily depleted. When yin and yang interact chaotically, true essence is not stabilized, and the valley spirit becomes unresponsive. This triple refinement method is described in the Book of Changes as the essence of heaven and earth, wherein all things are transformed into purity. Is this not the unity of heaven and humanity?</p>
<p>The method of collecting yin: when the tree weakens, it is nourished by the earth; when yang declines, yin supplements it. One must carefully nurture the original qi and not lose measure. In commentary it is noted that there is no sentimentality. When a tree reaches decay, it is still nourished by dust to regain vitality; anew, it sprouts tender branches, allowing even an old tree to achieve longevity. Thus, using thoughtful reasoning, yang weakens while yin supplements, making this approach suitable. Weak yang is supplemented by a little yin without loss, drawing in the essence and fluids to restore vitality, resulting in a rejuvenated appearance.</p>
<p>For boys and girls, as their vital essence remains unscattered, and their original energy is still harmonious, encountering such cultivation yields a hundredfold benefit. It is crucial to avoid letting one&#39;s original qi flow away.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《褚氏遗书》曰：建平王妃姬等，皆丽而无子，择良家未笄女入御，又无子。问曰：求男有道乎？澄对之曰：合男女必当其年，男虽十六而精通，必三十而娶；女虽十四而天癸至，必二十而嫁。皆欲阴阳气完实而后交合，则交而孕，孕而育，育而为子，坚壮强寿。今未笄之女，天癸始至，已近男色，阴气早泻，未完而伤，未实而动，是以交而不孕，孕而不育，育而子脆不寿。此王之所以无子也。然妇人有所产皆女者，有所产皆男者。大王诚能访求多男妇人，谋置宫府，有男之道也。王曰：善。未再期，生六男。夫老阳遇少阴，老阴遇少阳，亦有子之道也。<br>　　《身经通考》曰：王完虚公服万灵至宝仙酒两月，随获三胎。三仆服之，皆孕。内一人六十，妇五十二矣，已绝产念，二年亦孕，则尤异也。邹平县一人，精清无子，服之生一男。<br><a id="orig-94p" href="#trans-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Chushi Yishu&quot; states: The Princess of Jianping, Lady Ji, and others are all beautiful but without children. They selected good families for unmarried girls to enter the court, yet still had no children. It was asked: Is there a way to obtain sons? Cheng replied: For a couple, they must be of appropriate age; while a boy may be skilled at sixteen, he should marry at thirty; a girl may reach maturity at fourteen, but she should marry at twenty. They all desire the completion of yin and yang energy before they unite; thus, they conceive, give birth, and raise children, who are strong and live long. If a girl has not reached adulthood, her maturity is just beginning, already attracting male energy; her yin energy dissipates early, is incomplete, and suffers damage. Therefore, they unite but do not conceive, conceive but do not give birth, and raise children who are weak and short-lived. This is why the king has no sons. However, some women give birth only to girls, while others give birth only to boys. If the king can indeed seek many women who bear sons and plan a residence for them, there is a way to have sons. The king said: Good. Not long after, six sons were born. When the old yang encounters the young yin, and the old yin encounters the young yang, there is also a way to have children.</p>
<p>&quot;The Shenjing Tongkao&quot; states: The king took the immortal elixir of ten thousand spirits for two months and subsequently conceived three offspring. Three servants who took it all became pregnant. One of them was sixty years old, and another was fifty-two, having long since given up on the idea of childbirth, yet still became pregnant after two years, which is indeed unusual. In Zouping County, there was a man who was pure and had no children; after taking it, he fathered a son.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>
