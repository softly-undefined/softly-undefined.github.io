<p><strong>Lower Back Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yellow Emperor&#39;s Su Wen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>The north wind arises in winter; the illness resides in the kidneys, manifesting in the lower back and hips.<br><em>[Note: &quot;Yu&quot; refers to the place where the vital energy gathers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Section on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Liver stagnation caused by cold and dampness follows the same method as hernia, leading to lower back pain, cold feet, and headaches.  <em>[Note: In a person affected by the dampness of the earth, the condition must begin from the feet. The channel of the Jueyin (Liver) begins from the feet, rises through the back of the knees, enters the hair, passes through the genital area to the lower abdomen, and spreads to the ribs; thus, the symptoms are similar to those of hernia, with lower back pain and cold feet. The Jueyin meets the Governing Vessel at the crown, hence the headaches.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Essentials of the Pulses</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The waist is the external organ of the kidneys; if it cannot move or bend, the kidneys will be weak. The pulse of the kidneys, if it is strong and long, and has a yellow and red color, indicates a condition of low back pain. This is because the kidneys are related to the waist, and if the waist is injured, the kidney pulse will be vigorous. If it pushes upwards and does not descend, the waist and feet are clear. This indicates that the energy is strong above and weak below, leading to a cooling effect in the waist and feet. </p>
<p>When pressure reaches the bones and the pulse is weak, there will be pain in the lower back and numbness in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Heart Conditions:</strong></p>
<p>If there is a heart disease, if it is deficient, it will cause pain in the lower ribs and waist. This is because the heart Qi cannot descend and interact with the kidney Yin, thus leading to pain in those areas.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Heat Conditions:</strong></p>
<p>In the case of a cold injury on the first day, the great yang is affected, causing tightness in the head, neck, and lower back. The energy of the sun governs the skin and hair; thus, on the first day of a cold injury, it affects the sun. The yang energy is above, which causes pain in the head and neck, while the back, being of yang nature, results in tightness in the lower back. This describes the onset of disease from the influence of the yang energy.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Malaria:</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of malaria, it first manifests in the fine hairs, with stretching leading to symptoms, chills, and pain in both the lower back and spine. This is because the wei Qi is in agreement with the pathogenic Qi about to enter the Yin, leading to a deficiency in the surface Qi, thus causing initial symptoms in the fine hairs and stretching. If the great yang is deficient, pain will manifest in the lower back and the head and neck.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>【Note: The energy of the sun rises and manifests above, converging in the brain, exiting from beneath the neck, and following the back, hence pain occurs in the waist, back, and head.】 When evil is lodged in the waist and spine, sickness arises when the energy reaches the waist and spine.</p>
<p>【Note: When evil is contained in the waist and spine, it resides between the waist and back, and when the protective energy reaches the waist and back, it encounters the lodged evil, resulting in illness.】<br><strong>Discussion on Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>If the kidney energy is hot, then the waist and spine cannot function, the bones become brittle, and the marrow diminishes, leading to bone atrophy. 【Note: The kidneys are responsible for storing essence; if kidney energy is hot, then the essence is depleted. The waist is the organ of the kidneys; thus, the waist and spine cannot extend. The kidneys produce bone marrow, which manifests in bones; if kidney energy is hot and the essence is depleted, the marrow diminishes, the bones become brittle, and this leads to bone atrophy.】<br><strong>Discussion on Syncope</strong></p>
<p>When there is syncope and counterflow in the Jueyin, contractions, and waist pain occur. 【Note: Contractions are related to the liver, which governs tendons. The waist is the exterior of the liver.】 When there is counterflow in the Shaoyang, if the mechanisms are not functioning properly, the waist cannot move. 【Note: The Shaoyang governs the joints; thus, if Shaoyang energy experiences counterflow, the mechanisms become dysfunctional. The waist and spine are major joints of the body; hence, when the mechanisms are dysfunctional, movement is hindered.】 When there is counterflow in the hand Taiyang, the waist cannot bend or extend.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Notes: The waist should not bend forward or backward, as it is the main point of the meridians and vessels.</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In cases of illness with sudden turning pale, one examines the right pulse, which is deep and tight, and the left pulse, which is superficial and slow. Otherwise, where lies the cause of the illness? Qi Bo said: In winter, the right pulse should indeed be deep and tight, which corresponds with the four seasons. The left pulse being superficial and slow is contrary to the season. Therefore, the illness on the left indicates that it is associated with the kidney, but also relates to the lungs, so it indicates back pain. The Emperor asked: How can you say this? Qi Bo replied: The Shaoyin pulse connects the kidneys and the lungs; now with the lung pulse being present, the kidney is implicated in the illness, hence the kidney is the cause of back pain.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: The pulse corresponds with the four seasons, hence examining it in winter, both left and right pulses should be deep and tight. Now with the left pulse being superficial and slow, it is contrary to the seasonal energy. The kidneys govern winter energy, and to have it be floating on the left indicates it pertains to the kidneys, while also affecting the lungs, which leads to back pain. Following the principles of the extraordinary and regular channels, beginning with the Taiyin, the five organs are interconnected, whereby the essence derived from water and grains first reaches the hand Taiyin. The Taiyin lung metal generates and smoothly transmits to the kidneys, which should then communicate back to the liver. Now, the manifestation of the floating and slow lung pulse indicates that there is an illness in the kidney, causing the energy to revert contrary to the mother organ, thus indicating kidney-related back pain, while also having implications for the lungs.</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The so-called swelling of the lower back and waist pain in the Taiyang (Greater Yang) refers to the first month when Taiyang is in the Tiger position. The Tiger represents Taiyang. In the first month, the Yang energy emerges from above while the Yin energy is strong; hence, Yang has not yet assumed its proper order, resulting in swollen lower back and waist pain. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: This explains the pulse of a peculiar disease. Taiyang is the master of all Yang energies, originating from the water in the bladder, thus Taiyang&#39;s energy is marked as the beginning of the year. Although the Yang energy emerges from above in the first month, the Yin-cold energy is still strong, and Yang energy has not yet emerged in an orderly manner. Therefore, the swelling of the lower back and waist pain in Taiyang arises because Taiyang’s energy is still obstructed by Yin energy, highlighting the gentleness of Yang energy.]</strong></p>
<p>The so-called waist pain in the Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) refers to the Kidney, as in October, the Yang energy of all things is diminished, thus leading to waist pain.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: In October, the cold water is at work, hence it dominates the Lesser Yin Kidney in the feet.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Needling Essentials</strong></p>
<p>Needling the tendons should not injure the bones; if the bones are injured, this would internally disturb the kidneys. When the kidneys are disturbed, this leads to winter diseases such as swollen waist pain.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: When the kidney energy is disturbed, what is stored becomes deficient, causing the condition to be one of weakness and swelling, resulting in waist pain; the waist is the cavity of the kidneys.]</strong><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Long Needle Therapy</h3>
<p>When there is illness in the lower abdomen, causing abdominal pain and difficulty in urination or bowel movements, this condition is called &quot;hernia,&quot; which arises from cold. Insert needles between the lower abdomen and the thighs, and also between the waist and ankle bones. If the needles are inserted in abundance, the ailment will be cured completely. [Note: The areas between the lower abdomen and the thighs, and between the waist and ankle bones, are where the Liver Meridian of Jueyin circulates. Inserting needles abundantly and leaving them in place will wait for the heat to dissipate, after which the illness will be resolved.]</p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Transformation and Expansion</h3>
<p>When the year&#39;s water does not suffice, humidity prevails, causing the populace to suffer from pain in the waist and thighs. [Note: In a year of Liu Xin, when the water supply is inadequate, earth predominates, leading to the widespread occurrence of dampness which injures kidney yin, resulting in pain in the waist and thighs.] When the year&#39;s fire is inadequate, cold prevails, causing the populace to suffer from pain that radiates from the sides and back, to the extent that bending becomes impossible, and the hips feel as if separated. [Note: In a year of Liu Gui, when there is insufficient fire, water overcomes, leading to a prevalence of cold. The diseases caused by the solar qi manifest as ailments in the waist and back.]</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Five Constant Regulations</h3>
<p>When Taiyin governs the heavens, the humidity descends, and kidney qi rises. At such times, it leads to pain in the lower back and waist, making movement difficult. [Note: During the winter season, the kidneys govern qi, leading to lower back and waist pain, along with difficulty in movement, as kidney qi rises while being excessively diminished below.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Six Elements: A Great Discussion on the Turning of the Celestial Bodies</p>
<p>The government of the Taiyin governs the heavens, and the transformation of qi operates in the post-heavenly phase. The end of qi is characterized by a great rise of cold and a significant transformation of dampness; when affected by the cold, patients experience stiffness in the joints. Pain in the lower back is caused by cold and dampness pushing through the interaction of qi, resulting in illness. [Note: The essence of the end qi is derived from the cold aspect of water; hence the great rise of cold causes the cold and damp qi to intersect from above and below, leading to a significant transformation of dampness and resulting in stiffness of the joints and an obstruction in the bones. The lower back is related to the kidneys, and cold dampness pushes through the interaction of qi, placing individuals in the midst of this interaction.]</p>
<p>The government of the Shaoyin regulates the heavens, and the transformation of qi operates in the pre-heavenly phase. Cold severs the stomach, leading to heart pain, lower back pain, and abdominal distention. The initial qi leads people to react with tightness; they experience stiffness in the joints and lower back pain. [Note: Cold severance, which generates sickness from below, enters the stomach, causing heart pain, lower back pain, and abdominal distention, as cold and heat contest within and cause illness. The initial guest qi is from the cold water of the Taiyang. The initial governing qi comes from the Jueyin wind and wood. Therefore, when the wind arrives, the qi of spring creates stagnation, leading people to react with tightness; the Taiyang governs the kidneys, which are linked to the lower back, thus resulting in stiffness in the joints and lower back pain.]</p>
<p>The manifestation of water stagnation causes the people to suffer from cold-induced heart pain, lower back pain, and difficulty in the major joints, limiting flexion and extension. [Note: The lower back is associated with the kidneys. Flexion and extension of the joints relate to ailments of the muscles and bones; the kidneys govern the bones and the muscles are connected to the joints.] Lower back pain occurs where the Taiyang reaches.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>【Note: This is a common occurrence in summer illnesses.】</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of the True Ultimate</strong></p>
<p>In a year when the Taiyin is in the Well, people suffer from headaches with dizziness, eyes that seem to pop out, necks that feel as if pulled, waists that feel fractured, inability to bend the thighs, knees that feel knotted, and calves that feel separate. 【Note: The Taiyin in the Well refers to the year of Chen and Xu. From the headaches to the calf separation, it indicates that the earth element is overpowering, and both the water organs and bowels are ill.】 When the Yang is in the Well during the year, cold excess is predominant, leading to illnesses such as cramping in the lower abdomen and pain radiating from the waist to the heart. 【Note: The Yang in the Well refers to the year of Chou and Wei. The pulse of the Yang channels through the spine to the waist, hence the radiated pain. The kidney meridian is connected to the heart, causing pain to rise to the heart.】 The Taiyin governs the heavens, with an excess of humidity causing swelling and bone pain. In cases of cold obstruction, pressing the affected area yields no relief, with pain in the waist, spine, head, and neck, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the kidneys; if the Taixi pulse is blocked, the condition is fatal and untreatable. 【Note: The Taiyin governing the heavens refers to the year of Chou and Wei. Conditions of swelling and cold obstruction are due to the influence of cold and dampness. In cases of obstruction, they are referred to as &quot;Bi.&quot; The kidneys govern the bones while the bladder corresponds as a partner, hence the pain in the waist, spine, head, and neck. The Taixi pulse is the arterial channel of the kidneys, located above the outer ankle of the foot.】<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If the vitality of the kidneys is severed, there will be no recovery, hence death occurs without treatment. In the time of Yangming, dryness and excess lead to ailments such as throat dryness, facial dust, and back pain. These ailments originate from the liver; when the Taichong point is blocked, recovery is impossible.</p>
<p>(Note: The time of Yangming refers to the years of the rabbit and rooster. Throat dryness, facial dust, and back pain are all diseases of the liver meridian. The metal element excess above causes these liver-related issues. Taichong is located two inches below the base of the big toe and is an important point on the liver meridian. When liver vitality is severed, recovery is impossible.)</p>
<p>In the case of the Taiyin, if fire energy becomes internally repressed, dryness manifests as fullness in the lower abdomen and heaviness in the waist. </p>
<p>(Note: The heaviness of the waist signifies that dampness is excessive and affects the kidneys.)</p>
<p>As for the Taiyang, if Qi reverses and rises, the waist may experience pain in contraction and extension, with the lower abdomen pulling on the testicles and straining the waist and spine, which can affect the heart.</p>
<p>(Note: The pain in the waist and difficulty in movement is due to excessive water harming itself. The pulling at the lower abdomen and straining the waist and spine that impacts the heart relates to the Jueyin disease, potentially reflecting back on the energies of wood, fire, and earth from a year and a half prior.)</p>
<p>The Jueyin located in the spring is associated with pain in the waist and abdomen when the dominance shifts.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>【Note: Pain in the lower back and abdomen occurs when the vital energy at the source is affected, resulting from imbalances in the three energies of Taiyin, Yangming, and Taiyang.】 When Shaoyin is dominant, external influences lead to lower back pain.<br>【Note: The external influence associated with these conditions is the cold water of Taiyang; lower back pain represents a manifestation of Taiyang&#39;s pathways, with similar energies affecting each other.】 When Shaoyang is dominant, external influences cause pain in the lower back and abdomen, accompanied by a feeling of cold.<br>【Note: Pain in the lower back and abdomen, along with chills, indicates that external influences prevail and the vital energy of Taiyang is therefore compromised.】 When Yangming is dominant, internal influences result in heaviness in the lower back and abdominal pain.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Annotations</strong>: Lower back pain is caused by the cold water qi of the Taiyang penetrating from below. When Taiyang dominates the area, if the cold remains internally, it leads to pain in the lower back and buttocks, difficulty in bending and stretching, and pain in the thighs, shins, and knees. </p>
<p><strong>Annotations</strong>: The cold remaining internally refers to the residual effects of the Taiyang cold water qi entering the body. Pain in the lower back, buttocks, thighs, and shins is a symptom related to the Taiyang meridian. Difficulty in bending and stretching indicates that Taiyang governs the tendons.</p>
<p><strong>From the &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot;</strong><br><strong>Chapter on the Diseases of the Organs and Viscera</strong></p>
<p>The lung pulse is slightly rapid, indicating lung cold and heat, lethargy, coughing up blood, and pain in the lower back, spine, and chest. </p>
<p><strong>Annotations</strong>: The lungs control qi; symptoms such as lethargy, coughing up blood, and pain in the lower back, spine, and chest arise from deficiency and cold of lung qi. If there is a problem with the small intestine, there will be pain in the lower back and spine radiating to the testicles. </p>
<p><strong>Annotations</strong>: A problem with the small intestine means an issue with its organ qi, which is connected to the bladder, thus causing pain in the lower back and spine affecting the testicles.</p>
<p><strong>From the &quot;Shen&quot; Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Excessive anger can harm the will, and if the will is damaged, joy may cause one to forget previous words, resulting in an inability to bend and stretch the lower back and spine. </p>
<p><strong>Annotations</strong>: The lower back is associated with the kidneys, which store the will; if the will is damaged, this results in an inability to bend and stretch the lower back and spine.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>End and Beginning Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Above the waist, the Hand Taiyin and Yangming govern; below the waist, the Foot Taiyin and Yangming govern. [Note: The Hand Taiyin and Yangming govern the heavens, while the Foot Taiyin and Yangming govern the earth. The upper half of the body represents the heavens, and the lower half represents the earth.] For diseases in the waist, one should treat from the knee pit. [Note: The water energy of the kidneys and bladder corresponds to the upper and lower heavens.]</p>
<p><strong>Meridian Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Bladder Meridian of Foot Taiyang enters directly from the crown to connect with the brain, and runs alongside the spine to the waist; its branches descend from the waist, running alongside the spine to the hips. If this is moved, it causes back pain, as if the waist is broken. [Note: This disease resides in the energy of Taiyang.]</p>
<p>The Liver Meridian of Foot Jueyin, when activated, causes waist pain, making it impossible to bend forward or backward. [Note: The movement energy of Jueyin causes waist pain restricting bending, as it transforms from the energy of Shaoyang, relating to the pathological transformation of Jueyin energy.]</p>
<p><strong>Muscle and Tendon Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Injuries of the tendons of Foot Shaoyin, when external, prevent bending forward; when internal, prevent looking up. Thus, for Yang diseases, the waist bends backward and one cannot bow; for Yin diseases, one cannot look up. [Note: In external Yang disease, it affects the energy of Taiyang, causing the waist to bend backward; in internal Yin disease, it affects the energy of Shaoyin, leading to an inability to look up.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Distention</strong></p>
<p>Distention of the kidney brings fullness in the abdomen that pulls on the back, resulting in pain in the lower back and thighs. Distention of the small intestine causes fullness in the lower abdomen that pulls on the waist and is painful. </p>
<p><em>Note: This is the reverse flow of protective Qi within the barriers, leading to the distention of the organs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Separate Treatise on the Five Types of Urinary Retention and Fluids</strong></p>
<p>When Yin and Yang are not harmonious, fluids overflow and flow downward to the Yin, and the essence of the marrow is diminished and also descends. Excessive downward flow leads to deficiency; due to deficiency, there is pain in the lower back and soreness in the shins. </p>
<p><em>Note: The disharmony of Yin and Yang refers to the discord between Shaoyin and Yangming. When the Qi of Yin and Yang is not harmonious, the fluids and essence do not unite, causing the fluids to overflow outside the bones and flow downward. When fluids overflow externally, the essence of the marrow is diminished, leading to weakness. Excessive downward flow results in bone deficiency, causing lower back pain and shin soreness, which is the closure of the marrow pathways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Yin and Yang Linked to Day and Night</strong></p>
<p>Above the waist is Heaven, below the waist is Earth. Therefore, Heaven is Yang and Earth is Yin. </p>
<p><em>Note: Accumulated Yang is Heaven; accumulated Yin is Earth. When Heaven and Earth combine their Qi, it is called humanity. Thus, the upper half of the body is governed by heavenly Qi, while the lower half of the body is influenced by earthly Qi. Humans are born from the interplay of water and fire between Heaven and Earth, and therefore they share in the properties of both.</em> </p>
<p>Above the waist is associated with Yang, and below the waist is associated with Yin.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>【Note: The positioning of yin and yang indicates that the hand channels have yin and the foot channels have yang, which is the interaction of the energies from above and below.】<br>　　　　　<em>The Organs Chapter</em></p>
<p>If the kidney is small, the organs remain safely unharmed. If the kidney is large, it can lead to pain in the lower back, making it difficult to bend or stretch, and is easily affected by malign forces. If the kidney is low, there will be pain in the lower back and buttocks, making bending or stretching impossible, which is referred to as fox hernia. If the kidney is strong, there will be no pain in the lower back. If the kidney is tilted, it results in pain in the lower back and buttocks. 【Note: The lower back and spine are significant joints of the body, hence pain in the lower back, back muscles, or buttocks all makes bending or stretching impossible.

<p><strong>Lumbago</strong></p>
<p>When the disease affects the kidneys, the person&#39;s body feels heavy, and the waist feels cold as if sitting in water, appearing watery, yet they are not thirsty; urination is smooth, diet remains the same, indicating a condition of the lower burner. The body feels fatigued with sweating, and the clothing feels cold and damp. Over time, there is cold pain below the waist, feeling as heavy as carrying five thousand coins. This is treated with ginger and poria decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Lumbar Pain</strong></p>
<p>When kidney water is affected, the abdomen is large, the navel is swollen, and there is waist pain, with difficulty urinating. The lower part feels damp like the sweat on a cow&#39;s nose, and the feet are cold. The face appears unexpectedly thin. A disease above the diaphragm leads to phlegm fullness causing coughing and wheezing, vomiting with cold and heat. There is back pain and waist discomfort, tears flow from the eyes, and such a person shakes and trembles; there must be a hidden drink. For weakness and waist pain, with lower abdominal tightness and difficulty in urination, the Eight Flavors Kidney Qi Pill is the remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Swelling Requires Differentiating Above and Below the Waist</strong></p>
<p>The teacher said: For those with water retention, swelling below the waist should treat urinary smoothness; swelling above the waist must be treated with sweating to achieve health.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong><a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>In October, do not eat frost-kissed lettuce; it will cause one to lose their luster, have watery eyes, a painful heart, and aching waist.</p>
<p><strong>Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is weak, one experiences palpitations, is restless and sleepless, with pain radiating through the chest, abdomen, and back; they may feel joy or sadness and occasionally become dizzy or fall. The pulse of the left wrist is slightly rapid, and pain in the heart radiates to the back; one cannot eat. If the kidney pulse is weak, then yin pathogens invade the kidneys, causing bone pain and back pain that affects the spine. If the kidneys are swollen, they bring fullness and pain to the back, leading to a sensation of heaviness. </p>
<p>When the kidneys lack essence, pain arises that travels along the spine to the waist; hunger diminishes upon feeling full. If the kidney pulse is thin and soft and adheres to the bones, this is indicative. If the kidneys are cold, then there is simultaneous pain in the lower back and spine, with a dark complexion and dry ears, or potentially vomiting blood. Symptoms include difficulty in urination, fullness and hardness below the navel, slurred speech, back pain, heavy legs, and an inability to stand.</p>
<p><strong>Heaviness in the Waist</strong></p>
<p>There is difficulty with urination and defecation, while diet remains unchanged; the waist and legs feel heavy. Checking both radial pulses, if the pulse at the wrist is weak and thin, this indicates lower excess. When urination and defecation are difficult, even as diet fluctuates, if the waist and legs feel heavy as if one is sitting in water, walking becomes laborious, qi surges upward, and dreams are tumultuous, diagnosis shows the pulse at both wrists is slippery and thin, indicating lower deficiency. The patient&#39;s pulse is weak, thin, and small, all signs of lower deficiency. </p>
<p>Kidney wind leads to heavy pain in the waist and legs; if there are no yellow spots under the ribs, treatment is possible; otherwise, the person may die. For kidney wind, it is advisable to perform moxibustion on the kidney shu point.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Heat in the Lower Back</strong></p>
<p>The heart is filled with heaviness, empty and restless; the movement up and down is unpredictable.

Symptoms are worse in spring and better in winter, thus it requires urgent treatment, lasting no more than ten days.</p>

<p><strong>Heavy Pulse in the Lower Back</strong></p>
<p>The song of the kidney pulse states: The kidney disperses energy between the waist; urination is frequent and viscous. The slippery and stringy pulse makes the lower back and legs feel heavy, leading to pain in the kidneys. The song for a sinking pulse states: If the pulse is in the wrist and the lower back feels heavy, urination is thick and frequent, and the color is like dregs. The song for a slow pulse states: Flowing into the wrist, the lower back feels heavy; the thick clothes are undesirable when they seem too light. Observing color to assess life and death, the song says: Back pain and heavy lower back, recurring and difficult; this indicates bone severance, to be observed after five days.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Waist Pain Pulse</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Pain</strong></p>
<p>There are five causes of waist pain: First, the Lesser Yin, which relates to the kidneys; in the tenth month, the yang energy of all things declines, which causes waist pain. Second, Wind Bi, where wind and cold strike the waist, so there is pain. Third, Kidney deficiency; overexertion harms the kidneys, which causes pain. Fourth, falling and straining the waist leads to pain. Fifth, sleeping on cold ground, harmed by the earth&#39;s energy, induces pain. If the pain does not stop, it pulls on the waist and spine, causing pain. Those with waist and back pain generally suffer from weak kidney energy, especially when lying on cold, damp ground or exposed to wind. If not treated promptly, dampness flows into the legs and knees, resulting in numbness, chilliness, weakness, or heavy pain. If there is waist pain coupled with severely heavy numbness of the legs, one should take the Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Ren Zhai Zhi Zhi Fang</strong> (Song, Yang Shiying)</p>
<p><strong>Lower Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>When the blood is drained, it leads to lower back pain, akin to being pierced by a nail. Emotional distress that harms the spleen can cause lower back pain; anger that damages the liver also results in lower back pain. For both, it is advisable to use a formula of sandalwood to descend qi along with a qi-regulating powder, adding three slices of ginger and two jujubes for decoction and consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Ji Sheng Fang</strong> (Song, Yan Yonghe)</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: The lower back is associated with the kidneys. If it cannot rotate or sway, the kidneys will become depleted. From this, it can be understood that the lower back&#39;s proximity to the kidneys often results from excessive desires, which injure the kidney meridian. Once the kidneys are deficient, emotions such as joy, anger, and worry, as well as wind, cold, dampness, and toxins, can harm it, leading to lower back pain. Additionally, sudden injuries or strains can cause qi stagnation and blood stasis, also resulting in lower back pain. Generally, the pulses for lower back pain are all deep and tight. A deep and tight pulse indicates cold-related lower back pain; a deep and floating pulse indicates wind-related lower back pain; a deep, thin, and slippery pulse indicates damp-related lower back pain. For those with pain due to sudden injuries causing qi stagnation and blood stasis, the pulse is often deep, tight, and firm. One must identify the underlying causes and reconcile them with pulse and symptoms for effective treatment.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Disorders of Ulcers: [by Jin Dou Hanqing]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fire Waistband Poison</strong></p>
<p>This poison affects the heart and liver meridians, heating the poison and injuring the heart. It stagnates in the bladder and becomes blocked in the skin; this is a wind poison. One should use QIng Gan Liu Qi drink and Bai Du Liu Qi powder to treat it, and not apply external medicine casually. For the affected area, use a paste made from purple gold ingot water juice, frequently applying it with an goose feather for moisture.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Dan</strong></p>
<p>The internal dan appears as swelling and redness from below the ribs to the lower back, known as internal dan. If recognized early, it can be treated; if it reaches the waist, it cannot be treated. This condition often leads to dysfunction in urination and defecation, and there may be cases where it results in a dark blue-black color all over the body leading to death within three days. Use emergency dan paste for treatment on the internal dan area, and additionally take Lian Qiao Bai Du powder.</p>
<p><strong>Waist Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition is linked to the yin bao qi acupuncture point, affected by dampness which obstructs the flow of qi and blood, and causes stagnation in the meridians; this is a toxic condition. One should use back-raising medicine for treatment. Within three to five days, it is advisable to perform seven moxibustion procedures to eliminate it.</p>
<p><strong>Hejian Six Writings: [by Jin Liu Wanshu]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain Disorders</strong><a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>In cold, the intestines are loose, this disease causes diarrhea, leading to pain in the lower back and hips. When affected by wind, it may cause strong pain in the waist and spine. In cases of wind-heat illness, there is stagnation of Qi, muscle and tendon contraction, fatigue, and waist pain. If there is heat in the spleen, heat strikes and the waist pain becomes unbearable, making it hard to bend or stretch. If there is heat in the kidneys, the pain in the waist feels sour and there is bitter thirst. In women, postpartum blood stagnation causes heavy pain in the waist. In the case of febrile disease, when the pathogenic heat is on the surface, it must cause waist pain. When postpartum blood does not flow, menstrual cycles do not occur, there must be blood clots causing pain in the waist. In cases of Taiyang syndrome, there is stiffness in the waist, the pulse is floating with no sweat.</p>
<p>Regarding pain conditions:</p>
<p>For women experiencing pain in the lower back and hips, numbness in the legs, and a preference for warmth over cold, this is due to wind, cold, and damp obstruction. First, one may take around seventy to eighty pills of a damp-removing formula, adjusting dosage according to fullness or emptiness; subsequently, use Yugong powder to induce a discharge of more than ten bowel movements, verifying by the clear and cool excretion of yellow mucous; finally, take coarse water with ginger and jujube boiled together with Pingwei powder to scatter wind-dampness and harmonize blood and Qi.</p>
<p>For all men and women, whether from a single cough or due to sadness and tears, or from lifting heavy objects resulting in sharp waist pain that restricts movement and breathing, one can use a dispersing formula to induce a sneeze; once sweating occurs, the pain will cease. If unable to eat or drink, use Tongjing powder or Daoshui pills to induce more than ten bowel movements; once the discharge is complete, take Wujin pills or He Xue pills, and the pain will lessen and eventually stop.</p>
<p>For elderly individuals with kidney deficiency experiencing pain in the lower back and spine, if the kidneys are affected by dryness, it is crucial since the waist is linked to the kidneys. Acute measures must be taken to rectify kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>On Pain and Illness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Origins&quot; states: &quot;The place where the sun reaches causes lower back pain.&quot; It also states that &quot;the Great Yang, which is the sun, when deficient, causes pain in the head, neck, lower back, and spine.&quot; The meridian of the foot Taiyang bladder passes through and then emerges from the lower neck, following the inner shoulder and spine to reach the lower back, leading to symptoms of pain in the neck like being pulled, pain alongside the spine, a sensation of the lower back being broken, and an inability to bend the thigh. This is due to the deficiency of the meridian qi allowing pathogens to invade, hence the emergence of painful illness. The pathogens: wind, heat, dampness, dryness, and cold can all cause illness, but generally, cold and dampness are more prevalent while wind and heat are less common. There are also cases where exhaustion from sexual activity leads to kidney deficiency and back pain; this occurs because the Yang energy is too weak to move. The text says: “The lower back is the organ of the kidneys; if it cannot move or rotate, the kidneys are in decline.” It is advisable to use remedies such as kidney tonic pills or fennel pills to replenish the deficiency of Yang energy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>People who indulge in rich foods and frequently take medicinal potions, when intoxicated, damage their vital energy. This leads to a warming of kidney energy, which results in pain in the lower back and an inability to lift oneself. Over time, this can reduce bone marrow and lead to brittle bones and hair loss, requiring remedies such as Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, Zi Shen Wan, or Feng Sui Dan to replenish the deficiency of yin.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: for lower back pain, if caused by cold, treat the foot’s Taiyin and Yangming meridians; if by heat, treat the foot’s Jueyin, and do not use the Shaoyang meridian for bending and stretching. The three Yang meridians of the foot run from head to foot, while the three Yin meridians run from foot to abdomen; any area they pass can cause pain. Those who treat should carefully examine which meridian path is affected, follow the empty points to perform needling, and assess the nature of cold and heat to determine the appropriate medication.</p>
<p>For instance, if lower back pain is accompanied by a heavy, sluggish sensation in the body, this indicates damp heat within the meridian. In such cases, add one qian of Huangbai, five fen of Fuzi, and two qian of Cangzhucao to Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Pain Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>Lower back pain is primarily associated with damp heat, kidney deficiency, blood stasis, strains, and phlegm accumulation. A weak pulse indicates kidney deficiency; in such cases, herbs like Eucommia, tortoise shell, berberine, Anemarrhena, goji berries, and Wu Wei Zi may be ground into powder, with pig spinal marrow to be consumed. A coarse pulse indicates blood stasis, treated with Yin tonics, further mixed with peach kernel and safflower. A slow pulse indicates damp heat, for which herbs like Atractylodes, Eucommia, berberine, and ligusticum can be used. For pain caused by phlegm accumulation, modify the Er Chen Decoction with nanshen and banxia. If the lower back is unable to straighten, needle the Ren Zhong point.  </p>
<p>All kinds of pain are related to heat; therefore, cold and extreme tonics should not be used, and one must resort to warming and dispersing medicines. Ginseng should not be used for pain, as it strengthens Qi, which can exacerbate the pain if Qi becomes abundant but unfree. If there are sudden red spots on the face of a person in pain, it often indicates mortality.  </p>
<p>Lower back pain from damp heat typically flares up in overcast weather or after prolonged sitting. Those with kidney deficiency may experience persistent pain. Blood stasis is characterized by pain that is lighter during the day and worsens at night. The lower back is the external manifestation of the kidneys, essential for bodily movement and function. All meridians connect to the kidneys and influence the lower back; any deficiency in kidney Qi can lead to various issues such as cold invasion, damp accumulation, and heat retention, causing stagnation in blood and Qi, fluid accumulation, and different types of lower back pain.  </p>
<p>If the pulse is taut and deep, it indicates deficiency; if just deep, it signifies stagnation; a coarse pulse shows blood stasis; a slow pulse indicates dampness; and a slippery or hidden pulse relates to phlegm.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>Stagnation of Qi</h3>
<p>For Qi pain, when there is pain throughout the body, it&#39;s advisable to use a small amount of Mu Xiang (Aucklandia) in the medicine to help move Qi. If there is lower back pain due to cold and dampness that worsens with cold and improves with heat, it is recommended to use Wu Ji San (Five Accumulation Powder) with half a qian of Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia) and one qian of Du Zhong (Eucommia).</p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing lower back pain, with difficulty in turning to the side, use Da Jian Zhong Tang (Major Construct the Middle Decoction) with ten grains of Chuan Jiao (Sichuan Pepper). Prepare the following: take the kidney of a pig, slice it thinly without breaking it, sprinkle the crushed spice mixture layer by layer, wrap it in damp paper, and steam until cooked. Chew finely and drink with wine.</p>
<h3>Strain and Contusion</h3>
<p>For lower back pain from strain or contusion, it is advised to take Feng Yuan Tong Qi San (Restore Original Qi Powder) mixed with wine, or add one qian of Qian Niu Tou (Milk Vetch) powder to Wu Ji San, or seven pieces of Tao Ren (Peach Kernel).</p>
<h3>Chronic Illness</h3>
<p>For chronic lower back pain, one must use the prescription involving Guan Gui (Cinnamon) to dispel it. The same applies to pain in the abdomen and sides. Ju Xiang Wan (Tangerine Aroma Pill) is also used for chronic lower back pain, indicating the same principle as the prescription involving Guan Gui.</p>
<h3>Effective Formulas from Worldly Physicians 【Yuan Wei Yilin】</h3>
<h3>Discussion of Pain Disorders<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></h3>
<p>For wind-heat causing lower back pain, use the Baidu San with Xuduan, Tianma, Mugua, and Mint. For chronic deficiency with dampness and humidity invading, resulting in heavy pain in the lower back like stone and cold as ice, use Wuju San with Taoren and Wuzhuyou for the best effect.</p>
<p><strong>General Treatment Principles</strong></p>
<p>For deficiency, tonify with Duzhong, Huangbo, Rougui, Danggui, Wuwu, Tusizi, Tianmendong, and Shudi. For wind, disperse with Mahuang, Fangfeng, Qianghuo, and Duhuo. For cold, warm with Rougui, Ganjing, and Fuzi. For sprain or strain, mobilize with Danggui, Sumac, Ruxiang, Myrrh, Taoren, and Honghua. For blood stasis, remove it with Dahuang, Qianniuzi, Taoren, Huizhu, and Bozhong. For damp phlegm with flow, resolve and direct with Cangzhu, Wuqiong, Xiangfu, Baizhi, Zhishi, Juhong, Banxia, and Fuling. Each type should be treated accordingly, and one should not hold to a single approach. In daily life, those who consume rich and heavy foods often experience lower back pain due to damp-heat and Yin deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Causes of Pain</strong></p>
<p>The lower back is attached to the kidneys, encompassing cold, damp, wind, and deficiency, all of which can cause pain.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Stasis Pain</strong></p>
<p>When lower back pain feels like being stabbed with a needle or knife, accompanied by dark stools and reddish-yellow or dark urine due to blood stagnation in the lower back, it is called blood-stasis lower back pain, treated with Taoren wine mixed with Heishen San.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p>
<h3>Wind Pain</h3>
<p>If one experiences waist pain due to wind injury, whether on the left or right side, with pain that has no fixed location and radiates down to the legs, it is advisable to use Wujisan, adding half a qian of Fangfeng with each dose, or adding three whole scorpions is even better. Xiao Xuming Decoction and Duhuo Jisheng Decoction can also be chosen. It is also recommended to swallow Sanxian Dan. Fry Eucommia with ginger juice, grind to a powder, and mix one qian with warm wine to take on an empty stomach; this is known as Eucommia Wine, which treats kidney deficiency-related waist pain and also addresses issues caused by wind-cold.</p>
<h3>Blood Deficiency</h3>
<p>For women who have excessive blood loss, or those who suffer from blood deficiency leading to waist pain, one should enrich their blood.</p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing waist pain, if one cannot turn over and feels weak and lethargic, it is advisable to use the Jianzhong Decoction with ten grains of Sichuan pepper, taking waist kidney pills and raw deer antler pills. Additionally, one should take the Danxi fennel powder mixed with pig kidneys.</p>
<h3>Sprain and Strain</h3>
<p>If the pain is due to a sprain or bruising from impact, it is recommended to take Heishen San mixed with Jiu Yuantong Qi San. If this does not work, there may be stagnant blood, so it is best to first take Suhexiang Wan mixed with wine, then use Wujisan, increasing each dose with half a qian of rhubarb and half a qian of sandalwood, while doubling the amount of Dang Gui. For pain caused by labor and heavy lifting, one should use Heqi Yin or Puxian Zhengqi San. If pain is caused by both sprain and labor, mix raw Wujisan with five fried peach kernels.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Medical Essentials</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Back Pain Due to Qi Disorders</strong></p>
<p>There are five types of back pain caused by qi disorders: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cold</strong>: The classics state that when water is stagnant, people suffer from lower back pain, with major joints being unresponsive, causing difficulty in bending and stretching. It also mentions that when the sun arrives, back pain occurs. Furthermore, during the return of the sun, lower back pain can become more pronounced, with difficulty in movement. The treatment is through warming medicinals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dampness</strong>: The classics say that when the Taiyin governs the heavens, dampness descends, and kidney qi rises concurrently, this causes lower back pain with restricted movement. It further mentions that when the sun is at the springs, dampness overrides, resulting in back pain that feels like it is breaking. This too is treated with warming medicinals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Combined Cold and Dampness</strong>: The classics describe that during the governance of the Taiyin, when cold arises significantly and dampness transforms greatly, this leads to stiff joints and lower back pain. The treatment is through drying and heating remedies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dryness</strong>: The classics indicate that when the Yangming governs the heavens and is overpowered by dryness, it results in back pain. Treatment is provided with bitter warming medicinals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mixed Dry Heat, Wind, and Cold</strong>: The classics mention that during the governance of the Shaoyin, the interplay of water and fire, cold and heat causes qi stagnation, leading to back pain. In the initial stages of this condition, cold begins to manifest, and yang qi becomes stagnant, causing tightness and pain in the lower back. The treatment consists of more damp-heat and less cold-clear remedies.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Medical Canon Must-Read</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Zhongzi)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; pain in the lower back due to solar energy arises from external influences of the six pathogenic qi; while pain in the lower back related to kidney meridian results from internal injury caused by excessive desires. If one were to diligently apply their skills in moderation and maintain the fundamental principles of closure and preservation, then the true qi in the land would be flourishing, and the six qi would be harmful, yet they could not inflict damage. Only by depleting one’s essence and dispersing their true qi would the kidney become deficient and hurt, and how could the bladder, as an organ, stand alone? Hence, the six qi take advantage of the weakness to invade the solar energy, thus necessitating differentiated treatment. There may be cold, damp, wind-heat, strains, blood stasis, stagnant qi, or phlegm accumulation—all of which represent the symptoms, while kidney deficiency remains the root cause. If the symptoms are urgent, treat the symptoms first; if the root is heavy, address the root. By not losing sight of both symptoms and root, the illness cannot escape its manifestation.  </p>
<p><strong>Cold Infection</strong>  </p>
<p>When one contracts a cold and experiences pain, the pulse will surely be tight, with the lower back feeling like ice; warmth will alleviate the pain, while cold will exacerbate it. Use Wujisong Decoction with added Platycodon, or Ginger and Aconite Decoction with added Cinnamon and Eucommia. Additionally, apply liniment externally on the lower back. In the case of concurrent cold-damp conditions, add Atractylodes and Ephedra to the Wujisong Decoction.  </p>
<p><strong>Damp Injury</strong>  </p>
<p>Injury from dampness feels like sitting in water; the kidney is associated with water, and prolonged exposure to dampness from sitting or from rain may cause lower back pain and a feeling of heaviness with a slow pulse. Symptoms will certainly arise in cloudy weather. Use the Shenshi Decoction or Shen Zhaotang; if there are also wind-damp factors, use the Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p>
<h3>Wind Pain</h3>
<p>When the wind pulse is floating and the pain occurs in an unpredictable location, it affects both legs. Use Wuji San combined with Fangfeng and Quanxie, or a small amount of Xuming Tang. Fry Du Zhong with ginger juice into a powder, taking one qian with wine to treat kidney-related lower back pain, also addressing wind and cold; or use Niu Xi with wine.</p>
<h3>Heat Pain</h3>
<p>When the pulse is surging and rapid, there is thirst and difficulty in urination, use Gando Soup along with Xuduan and Tianma.</p>
<h3>Sprains and Contusions</h3>
<p>For injuries from falls or impacts, use Ru Xiang for pain relief, and Bai Shen San combined with Fu Yuan Tongqi San, adjusted with wine. If ineffective, there may be bad blood, in which case add Tao Ren and Chuan Shan Jia to Si Wu Tang and Da Huang. For pain caused by labor and heavy lifting, take Shi Bu Tang with Qing E Wan.</p>
<h3>Blood Stasis</h3>
<p>With a rough pulse and pain that feels like being pierced by a needle, dark stools, and yellow or dark urine that is lighter during the day and heavier at night, use Tiao Rong Huo Luo Yin, or adjust with Tao Ren and black Shen San.</p>
<h3>Qi Stagnation</h3>
<p>When the pulse is deep, use Ren Shen Shun Qi San or Wu Yao Shun Qi San, and add Wu Jia Pi and Mu Xiang, or use Xiang Fu, Tan Xiang, and Chen Xiang each three qian and brew into a decoction to take on an empty stomach.</p>
<h3>Phlegm Accumulation</h3>
<p>With a slippery pulse, use Er Chen Tang and add Nan Xing, Xiang Fu, Wu Yao, and Zhi Ke. For a strong pulse, use Er Chen Tang with Da Huang.</p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></h3>
<p>The waist is weak, the knees are sore and soft; the pulse may be large or thin, and there is no strength when pressed; the pain is also dull and subtle, not severe, distinguishing between cold and heat. The pulse is thin and soft, with weak strength and shortness of breath; urination is clear and smooth, treat with formulas like Kidney Qi Pills, Fennel Pills, Deer Antler, and Sheep Kidney. If the pulse is large but soft and urination is yellow, it indicates false fire; treat with formulas like Six Flavor Pill or Fengsui Dan. Danxi says: for kidney deficiency pain, must use the cinnamon bark to relieve it.</p>
<p>External pathogen differentiation </p>
<p>For the Taiyang syndrome, there may be sweating or no sweating. For cold damage, use Ren Shen Shun Qi San. For wind damage, use Bai Du San, or Tong Qi Fengfeng Tang, and externally apply a three-edge needle to induce bleeding, which is quite effective. When Taiyang combines with Yangming, use Ge Gen Tang. For Shaoyang, use Chai Hu Gui Zhi Tang, accompanied by a headache evaluation. For Shaoyin lumbar pain, it feels like a horizontal beam in the lower back, and in severe cases, leads to urine incontinence. For Jueyin wind-heat, it causes tightness in the lower back like a bow; use Wu Ji San combined with Du Zhong and Fu Zi, or add to Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang or Dang Gui Si Ni Tang for reference with various lumbar pains. For cold damage causing lumbar pain, medications must follow the six meridian patterns. Common cold with severe pain that cannot turn over, if cold damages the kidney, it emerges with cold weather, leading to back stiffness; the pulse is deep, string-like, and urgent. Use Wu Ji San with Wu Yao, Du Zhong, and Tao Ren, and if pain is especially severe, add a little black Qian Niu Zi. For limb coldness, use Guo Jiang Fu Tang; for shoulder and back pain, use Tong Qi Feng Feng Tang or Mo Yao Dan, with flexing and extending techniques.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Kidney Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>For new lumbar pain, it is advisable to expel external pathogens and clear damp-heat; if long-lasting, tonify the kidneys and harmonize qi and blood. The lumbar region corresponds to the kidneys and supports the body, allowing for mobility. However, various channels connect with the kidneys and intertwine in the lumbar spine; thus, whether caused by external factors or internal injury, if it is not due to kidney deficiency, the pathogens cannot accumulate. Therefore, one should not use cooling medicines exclusively, nor can one rely solely on ginseng and astragalus to tonify qi. Severe pain accompanied by sudden red spots on the face and a dark area around the philtrum indicates death.</p>
<p><strong>Damp Heat</strong></p>
<p>Long-term exposure to low and moist conditions, combined with the invasion of rain and dew, leads to dampness accumulation, causing the lower back to feel heavy like stone and as cold as ice. Preference for warmth, with no thirst and normal bowel movements, requires adding aconite to a kidney soup. If there is heavy water retention and difficulty in urination, use Wuling Powder or Shenshi Decoction. For heavy lumbar pain, use a single-angle fennel powder. If it lasts long, soak single cow&#39;s knee in wine and take Qing&#39;e pills, adding rhizoma for a better effect. In cases where dampness is combined with heat, especially with summer heat and humidity mingling or due to rich foods causing damp-heat, similar treatments apply. For excess conditions, use the Ermiao Cangbai Powder with Chaihu and Fangfeng decoction. For deficiency conditions, use Qiwwei Cangbai Powder. If the urine is red, use Wuling Powder, Qiangzao Decoction, or Jianbu Pills. For cases where other medicines are ineffective, use Gansui or Qianniú for a strong diuretic effect, as damp-heat is severe. An ancient remedy involves using three qian of Gansui powder cooked with pork kidneys and taken on an empty stomach with wine.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p>
<h3>Wind Pathology</h3>
<p>Wind injures the kidneys causing lower back pain, with no fixed direction, affecting the feet and knees, leading to an inability to bend or look around. For wind-heat, use Bai Du San with Du Zhong. If there is difficulty in urination, use Gan Dou Soup with Xu Duan and Tian Ma. For wind deficiency, use Xiao Xu Ming Tang with Tao Ren, or Wu Yao Shun Qi San with Wu Jia Pi. For wind accompanied by cold and dampness, use Wu Ji Jiao Jia San with fried scorpion, Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang, Qiang Huo Sheng Shi Tang, and add modified Long Hu San, or use Dan Wei Ling Xian as a powder mixed with wine.</p>
<h3>Internal Injury from the Seven Emotions</h3>
<p>When one loses their ambition, the heart&#39;s blood does not flourish, failing to nourish the tendons and vessels, causing blockage in the lower back with a feeling of fullness, resulting in weakness and a dark complexion. This makes it difficult to stand for long or travel far. Use Qi Qi Tang with doubled Fu Ling, adding a little Chen Xiang and Ru Xiang. For those who are deficient, hearts and kidneys should be simultaneously nourished; use Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang with Du Zhong and Niu Xi. </p>
<p>All five organs derive Qi from grains, with the spleen being the granary of the stomach. Worry and overthinking injure the spleen, resulting in impaired stomach Qi, lower back pain, and fullness in the abdomen and ribs, which can cause numbness in the flesh. Use Chen Xiang Jiang Qi Tang and Mu Xiang Yun Qi San; if food cannot be digested, use Yi Xiang San. </p>
<p>The reproductive organs gather Qi, and the liver is closely related to the kidneys. Anger injures the liver, leading to relaxation of the tendons, lower back pain, and pain in the ribs. Use Ju Xiang Yin Zi and Tiao Gan San. If there is an external condition along with emotional disturbances, use Ren Shen Shun Qi San, Wu Yao Shun Qi San, and Zhi Gan San with scallion whites, along with Qi Xiang Wan, Qing Mu Xiang Wan, and Li An Wan.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm-Damp Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm-damp obstructing the meridians causes back pain; if the pulse is slippery, use Er Chen Tang with Nanzhong, Cangzhu, and Huangbai. For wind, add Mahuang, Fangfeng, and Qianghuo. For cold, add Ginger, Cinnamon, Fuzi, and Kongxian Dan. If there is diarrhea, use Chuan Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Food Stagnation and Depression</strong></p>
<p>Food accumulation due to overeating and drunkenness leads to damp-heat entering the kidneys, resulting in lower back pain making it hard to bend or stretch. Use Siwu Tang and Er Chen Tang with Malt, Shénqū, Gehua, Sharen, Duzhong, Huangbai, Guangkui, and Zhike. If the pain is severe, use Suyxiao San. For accumulation, use Jiawei Longhu Bi. For damp-heat, use Qiwèi Cangzhu San and Qingzao Tang.</p>
<p><strong>Sprain and Contusion with Blood Stasis</strong></p>
<p>Sprains and falls causing blood stasis result in lower back pain, which is lighter by day and heavier by night; promote blood circulation and relieve qi. For excess cases, use Taoren Chengqi Tang; or equal parts Dahuang and Ginger, soaked overnight, taken in the morning. For chronic cases, use Biyin Wan with Taoren and Honghua; or Wujisan without Mahuang, adding Fennel, Muxiang, and Betel Nut. For pain radiating to the sides, use Fuyuan Tongsheng San with Muxiang.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Exhaustion Injures the Kidneys</strong></p>
<p>Exhaustion injures the kidneys; for this, use Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction with added Danggui, Duzhong, or Sihua Decoction with Zhimu, Huangbai, Wuweizi, and Duzhong, and take Dabu Yinshi Pills. If there&#39;s heat, use Du Huo Decoction. For mental exhaustion, dream of receiving Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, and take it with Duzhong decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Desire Injures the Kidneys</strong></p>
<p>Sexual desire injures the kidneys, leading to insufficient essence and blood to nourish the tendons, resulting in yin deficiency, causing lingering pain and inability to lift; for this, use Duzhong Pills or Binyin Pills. For yang deficiency with weak waist unable to perform, use Jiuwu An Shen Pills with Duzhong, Lurong Beibei Pills, Bawei Pills with Lurong, Mugua, Danggui, and Xuduan, or Wanshen Pills and pig kidney wine.</p>
<p><strong>Stasis of Blood</strong></p>
<p>For pain from blood stasis, use a three-edged needle at the Weizhong point to draw blood, as blood is stagnated below. When blood stasis is in the足太阳, 太阴, and 少阳 channels leading to waist pain, use Chuanxiong and Rougui Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Kidney Deficiency and Pain</strong></p>
<p>For kidney deficiency where the pain does not cease, use An Shen Pills to treat it.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Fire and Weakness</strong></p>
<p>For weakness in the waist, it is due to hidden heat in the kidneys and liver; treat with Huangbai and Fangji. </p>
<p><strong>The Six Essentials of Medical Standards</strong> <a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Damp Heat</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is rapid and tight, or sinking and scattered; the urine is yellow, and there is pain in the lower back that makes it difficult to bend or stretch. When encountering cloudy weather or sitting for a long time, pain occurs, indicating damp heat. It is advisable to drain dampness and clear heat, using a modified Dang Gui Nian Tong Decoction. If there are chills and fever, one should first disperse.</p>
<p><strong>Damp Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is slippery or hidden; there is phlegm with movement, or a lump causing pain, indicating damp phlegm, commonly seen in overweight individuals. It is appropriate to regulate qi and resolve phlegm, using a modified Huophtan Decoction; if ineffective, use Kou Yan Dan gradually. Pain in the lower back is caused by the foot Taiyang channel. Pain in the hips is along the foot Shaoyang gallbladder channel. If caused by injury from cold dampness that obstructs the channels and joints, leading to disharmony of qi and blood resulting in lower back and hip pain, one should use a damp-resolving pill, or a damp-draining decoction with additions of Peony, Qingpi, Cangzhu, and Betel nut. If phlegm stagnates in the channels, use a Phlegm-Resolving Decoction with Betel nut, Qingpi, and Peony. Dan Xi believed in kidney and liver hidden heat, treating with Huangbai and Fangji.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, or both pulses are full, suddenly making it difficult to bend or stretch, indicating sudden back pain. Although it may arise suddenly, there must be some awareness for treatment to be effective. First, grind milk and myrrh finely and mix with wine to drink. Then use blood-activating and qi-moving medicines for recovery. If ineffective, there must be blood stasis; use Wujisan with added Tao Ren, Dahuang, and Su Mu, each a penny&#39;s worth, and double the amount of Dang Gui.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p>
<h3>Stagnation of Blood</h3>
<p>The pulse is deep and sluggish or hollow, lighter during the day and heavier at night, with black stools and yellow urine. Turning to the side feels like being stabbed with a needle. For severe blood stasis, it is advisable to promote qi and invigorate the blood. A modified version of Four Substance Decoction from &quot;Yuan Rong&quot; should be used, possibly adding peach kernel and safflower as the main ingredients. For those robust with abundant qi, follow with peach kernel and invigorating herbs like safflower and cinnamon. This treatment is especially applicable when there are bruises or traumas leading to blood stasis. </p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>The pulse is large or both wrists feel strong and full, with persistent pain; this indicates kidney deficiency. It is advisable to nourish the kidney, using Four Substance Decoction with additions of yellow bacopa, eucommia, and herbs like five-flavor fruit. One could take Kidney Nourishing Pills or Qing E Pills, or grande tonic pills for yin deficiency or Rhizoma Dioscoreae Pills. Generally, all lower back pain arises from kidney deficiency. If accompanied by pathogenic factors, remove the pathogens first. For instance, mix sweet leaf, dried tangerine peel, and angelica in equal parts, take three qian, and consume with liquor. According to &quot;Rules,&quot; use roasted black and white zhuo, three qian each, slightly roasted dog spine, three qian of rhizoma dioscoreae, two qian of myrrh, and five walnut meats, prepare into a paste. In severe cases, add five roasted large beans, take five to seven times. Afterward, use Kidney Decoction or unparalleled yam pills, which first purge and then tonify.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Yin Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>For those who suffer from fatigue and hard labor, nourishment is needed to benefit the limbs and joints. Use a formula of Four Substances combined with Angelica, Qianghuo, Du Zhong, and Niu Xi, with a small amount of cinnamon as a guide. If there&#39;s heat, add Zhimu; in severe cases, use the Ten Supplements Decoction or swallow Qing’e Pills.</p>
<p><strong>External Pathogen</strong></p>
<p>Wind injures the kidneys, causing pain, and the pulse will show a floating quality. In &quot;Three Causes Prescription,&quot; use three taels of Du Zhong, stir-fried, and decocted with wine for consumption. Niu Xi taken with wine treats wind toxins attacking the kidney, causing stabbing pain. If affected by wind, cold, or dampness resulting in pain, it is advisable to use Wujisan with adjustments, with Qianghuo as the main herb. </p>
<p>For severe lower back pain, do not use invigorating herb or cold medications. Initially, warmth and dispersing medications must be added to harmonize the blood and quicken the qi; later, kidney tonics including the Four Substances, Niu, and Du Zhong should be added. Those who labor excessively must be replenished. Assess the deficiency of qi and blood, and for treatment, use a small amount of Zhi Fu Zi as a guide for downward action, which is most effective.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Qi Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>When there is stagnation of qi and pain, the pulse must be deep and string-like or hidden. For those with a robust constitution, at the onset, it is suitable to use fragrant wood to disperse qi and nourish blood over time.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Six Principles of the Right Record&quot; states: Pain in the lower back is due to the influence of the sun. It also says: The Great Yang is the sun; when deficient, it causes pain in the lower back, head, and neck. When there is illness in the kidneys and liver, there will be stagnation and pain in the lower back. The scriptures say: The lower back is the organ of the kidneys; when it cannot move freely, the kidneys will be weary. All meridians connect to the kidneys and are linked to the lower back and spine. When kidney qi is deficient, pathogenic qi can easily invade, whether it be wind, cold, heat, or dampness. Alternatively, if blood coagulates and qi stagnates, it leads to obstruction and heaviness, causing the small intestine to be unable to transmit, resulting in symptoms. The &quot;Suwen&quot; discusses pain in the lower back stating that it divides into six meridian illnesses. For instance, pain in the lower back associated with the sun manifests with the neck, back, and buttocks feeling heavy. Pain in the lower back linked to the Yangming does not permit looking back; if one looks back, it seems as though something is seen, leading to sadness. Pain in the lower back associated with the Shaoyang feels like being pricked with needles, and it is difficult to bend or stretch. The pulse is dispersed, causing back pain and heat, which can lead to restlessness, with the lower back feeling as if there is a horizontal wood within it, and severe cases may result in involuntary urination. Pain in the lower back linked to the Shaoyin pulls into the spine and the sides.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The pain in the lower back of the Jueyin, feels like a bowstring being drawn tight. It is characterized by a sense of unease and lack of understanding. The channel addressed is the separate channel of the foot Taiyang, which causes lower back pain radiating to the shoulders, often accompanied by a feeling of urgency to urinate. Moreover, the pain is similar to a pulling sensation, akin to bending the waist, and is often accompanied by fear. </p>
<p>The channel corresponding to Yin also pertains to the separate connection of the foot Shaoyang, which induces lower back pain that feels like a small hammer lodged within, causing swelling. The Yangwei channel, being a unique branch of the Taiyang, results in lower back pain with swelling above. The Hengluo channel, being a connection outside of the Taiyang, leads to pain in the lower back that makes bending forward or backward unbearable; any attempt to lift heavy objects aggravates the injury, and should this connection be severed, bad blood returns to it. </p>
<p>The Huiyin channel, the central meridian of the foot Taiyang, causes lower back pain that is accompanied by copious sweating; when the sweat dries, it induces a thirst that makes one feel the urge to flee. The Feiyang channel corresponds to the Yinwei channel, resulting in lower back pain that feels heavy and burdensome, leading to extreme sadness and fear. The Changyang channel, which corresponds to the Yinqiao channel, causes lower back pain that radiates to the chest, and intense discomfort may lead to a rolling back of the tongue, rendering one unable to speak.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The pulse in the flesh is born from the Shao Yang, hence it is the pulse of the Yang Wei that manifests. This causes waist pain; one cannot cough, for coughing induces a tightening of the tendons, causing pain that radiates to the spine, reaching the head and causing a sensation of being stiff and collapsing, leading to a desire to faint. It is advised to needle the foot Tai Yang.</p>
<p>For waist pain, if there is cold above, needle the foot Tai Yang and Yang Ming. If there is heat above, needle the foot Jue Yin. One cannot bend or look up, so needle the foot Shao Yang. If there is internal heat and shortness of breath, needle the foot Shao Yin. If there is fullness in the lower abdomen, needle the foot Jue Yin. Waist pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and cannot be faced upwards should be treated by needling both ankles above.</p>
<p>The section regarding heat states: for those suffering from spleen heat disease, the heat struggles cause waist pain inhibiting bending and fullness in the abdomen leading to diarrhea. For kidney heat disease, pain first occurs in the waist and thighs, accompanied by thirst. </p>
<p>Moreover, the waist is a major joint of the body, associated with the six channels and their supporting vessels, which are often deficient and sometimes excessive. This condition may result from excessive sexual activity or attacks from the four qi, causing deficiency and allowing pathogens to contend, resulting in pain. </p>
<p>According to the writings of the Chao family and the &quot;Qian Jin Fang,&quot; there are five theories regarding waist pain, each with different causes: First, insufficient Yang qi, leading to Shao Yin kidney weakness, hence waist pain. Second, wind-dampness causing pain in the waist.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The third point is kidney deficiency, which causes pain due to overwork harming the kidneys. The fourth point is kidney and lumbar injuries, which cause pain due to injuries to the lower back. The fifth point is sleeping on damp ground, which also leads to pain. This discusses the causes of illness. Chen Wuze further divides it into three causes. Generally, the Taiyang and Shaoyin are often afflicted by cold, while the Shaoyang and Jueyin are more prone to wind; the Yangming and Taiyin are often impacted by dryness and dampness. Thus, lower back pain related to these six meridians is due to external factors. If there is a loss of ambition, it injures the kidneys; excessive anger harms the liver; worry and contemplation harm the spleen. In such cases, lower back pain arises from internal factors. Generally speaking, this condition is never not caused by kidney deficiency. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; foot meridians—three Yin, three Yang, and twelve channels including the eight vessels—are connected to the kidneys and lower back pain. Each channel has specific acupuncture methods for treatment; or if wind, cold, dampness, and heat accumulate, combined with loss of ambition, excessive sexual activity, injuries, sprains, stagnation of Qi and blood resulting in pain, one should investigate the five types of three causes. Ultimately, treatment should be based on the source, using methods of sweating, purging, tonifying, or draining for therapy. If the pulse is floating and wiry, it indicates wind; if it is wiry and tight, it points to cold; if it is deep and thin, it signifies dampness; if it is deep and solid, it denotes heat; and if it is deep and slippery, it indicates Qi or blood stagnation. Understanding the illness in relation to the six meridians and five categories of three causes allows for a clear diagnosis, and the use of medicine will yield comprehensive efficacy.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lumbar Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about a carbuncle occurring between the kidneys, near the fourteenth vertebra, what should be said? It is called a kidney-related carbuncle, indicating a downward involvement. This results from excessive sexual activity, leading to damage of kidney essence, which causes dryness in the mouth, severe chills and fever, pain in all joints, and an urgent need to take medicinal formulas like Sheng Jindan, Huangqi Neituosan, and Huoming Yin augmented with Qianghuo and Huangqi for treatment. If the condition is severe and starts to ulcerate, those with deeper membrane involvement may die. If symptoms include coughing, nausea, a sensation of the waist being broken, an inability to bend or stretch, and refusal to eat, death is imminent. If there is a discharge that is clear and thin, with a foul smell from rot, and the patient is in a confused state and unresponsive, especially if there are signs of reverse Qi stagnation, treatment is futile.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Stone Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When asked about a person suffering from an abscess between the waist and hips, with unchanged flesh color, as hard as stone, that has not ruptured after a month, it is said: This is called &quot;stone abscess,&quot; caused by accumulated heat affecting the Shaoyang and Yangming meridians, where the evil poison has solidified and the original qi is insufficient, hence it cannot discharge. Use the &quot;Lifegiving Decoction&quot; with Du Huo, Qiang Huo, Chai Hu, Huang Qi, and Zi Jin Dan. For the robust, administer Ba Zhen San and one Jin Dan; for the elderly and weak, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang or Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang for assistance. If there is deep blackness with no swelling, numbness without pain, vomiting, inability to eat, mental confusion, or if the pulse is scattered or intermittent, it may be fatal. If the spirit is clear and pulse is harmonious, take Tai Ge Zi Wei Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Waist Fire Sores</strong></p>
<p>When asked about sores that encircle the waist, resembling clusters of pearls, it is said: This is called &quot;fire belt sores,&quot; also known as &quot;waist fire pills.&quot; It is caused by the heart and kidneys not interacting, internal liver fire blazing, flowing into the bladder, and entwining the belt channel, thus resembling a binding belt. Urgently take the &quot;Inner Clearing Huang Lian Decoction.&quot; For the robust, administer one Jin Dan; for the Lifegiving Decoction, add Qin, Lian, Huang Bo, and apply external heat-clearing and detoxifying medicine. If this condition is not treated promptly, and it wraps around the waist completely, the poison enters through the navel, leading to swelling, inability to eat, and eventual death.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Formulation Examination</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Wu Kun)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Waist Pain</strong><a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The text states: The waist is an organ of the kidneys, governing water and fire, and it is the root of life. If well adjusted, the foundation is solid and the leaves flourish; if poorly adjusted, the roots wither and the leaves droop. After examining four major prescriptions for treating the waist, it is clear.</p>
<p>For waist pain due to kidney deficiency, Qing&#39;e is combined with Huangbo and Zhimowan for treatment. The kidneys represent the Kan (water) element; illnesses stem from water and fire. If water declines, yang energy alone governs, leading to heat in the kidneys; if fire declines, yin energy attacks, causing cold in the kidneys. When both water and fire decline, the earth energy dominates, allowing pathogens to enter the kidneys, resulting in waist pain. This formula includes materials like old paper, Duzhong, and walnuts, which are rich and warming; Huangbo, Zhimou, and Niuxi, which are rich and cooling. Warming substances can nourish yang, while cooling substances can nourish yin, balancing them allows the mixture to reach the lower body. If Bihai is used, it is a bitter and drying substance that effectively disperses pathogenic water and earth, stabilizing its energy. Qing&#39;e represents the Kan element that nurtures yang. Therefore, by naming the formula, the essence of balancing water and fire is made clear.</p>
<p>For weak kidney qi with liver and spleen qi attacking, resulting in pain and discomfort in the waist and knees, along with coldness and weakness, the treatment is Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang. The kidneys are the water organs; if they are deficient, liver and spleen qi gather, making the waist and knees feel heavy and painful. If there is difficulty in bending and stretching, it indicates illness in both muscles and bones. The &quot;Lingshu Jing&quot; states: if one can bend but not stretch, the issue is with the muscles; if one can stretch but not bend, the issue is with the bones. Therefore, we understand that difficulty in bending and stretching signifies illness in both muscles and bones. If there is cold obstruction, it is due to excess of yin pathogen; lack of strength indicates deficiency in qi and blood.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The following herbs—Duhuo, Jisheng, Xixin, Qinjiao, Fangfeng, and Gui Xin—are warming in nature and can elevate the energy of the liver and spleen. When the liver and spleen energy rises, the waist and knees will not ache. Angelica, cooked Rehmannia, Bai Shao, Chuan Xiong, Du Zhong, and Niu Xi are nourishing herbs that can replenish the yin of the liver and kidneys. When the yin of the liver and kidneys is replenished, the feet will have enough blood to walk. Ginseng, Fuling, and Licorice are herbs that benefit qi; they can nourish the yang of all organs. When the yang of all organs is strengthened, the cold and numbness will have power.</p>
<p>When the kidneys are affected by dampness, the waist feels cold like ice; if there is something amiss, Jingguo Decoction is the remedy. The kidneys govern water, while the spleen controls dampness. When dampness prevails, it flows and must return to the water region, hence the term “kidney dampness.” The waist is associated with the kidneys, and dampness is a yin-like energy, hence the waist feels cold like ice.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>If there is something, it indeed adheres to that. Dried ginger is a hot and spicy substance; its spiciness derives from the dryness of metal, while its heat comes from the directive of fire. Dryness can overcome dampness, and sunlight can expose dampness, which is why it is symbolized and applied. White atractylodes and licorice are sweet and warm products; their sweetness derives from the flavor of earth, and warmth comes from the energy of earth. Earth is strong and can control dampness, so they are used to assist. White Poria is a sweet and bland product; its sweetness enhances the earth to guard against water, and its blandness opens the orifices to aid, which is essential in strategizing. </p>
<p>For mild lower back pain, use pig&#39;s kidneys, Qingyan (blue salt), and eucommia bark as main ingredients. The Book of Changes states: &quot;Similar things gather together, and objects divide into groups.&quot; Thus, pig&#39;s kidneys can nourish the lower back. The classics say: &quot;Among the five flavors, salt first enters the kidneys,&quot; which is why Qingyan can address the lower regions. Eucommia bark is a spicy and sweet substance that benefits the kidneys. By using pig&#39;s kidneys and assisting with Qingyan, it directly reaches the kidneys and nourishes them.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Lumbar Pain</strong></p>
<p>Lumbar pain is traditionally classified into five types: First, deficiency of Yang, indicating Kidney decline; second, pain due to wind-dampness or cold; third, injury to the kidneys from overwork; fourth, damage from falling or heavy impacts; and fifth, pain from sleeping on damp ground. Although this classification is generally accurate, it does not capture all aspects. This condition has variations in terms of exterior and interior, deficiency and excess, cold and heat. Understanding these six categories can provide a comprehensive overview, and treatment is not difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, continuous and recurring lumbar pain indicates kidney deficiency; pain that worsens in rainy conditions or after prolonged sitting suggests dampness; pain associated with cold and a preference for warmth indicates a cold condition; pain exacerbated by heat, with a preference for cold, suggests heat; pain due to frustration or anger indicates stagnation of Qi; pain accompanying worries or mental strain suggests Qi deficiency; and pain arising from exertion suggests Qi exhaustion. It is essential to identify the causes and treat accordingly.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>The waist is the residence of the kidneys, and the kidneys and bladder are interconnected. Thus, in terms of meridians, it belongs to the Yang aspect; in terms of organs, it is related to kidney qi, which is also a crucial junction for the Chong, Ren, Du, and Dai meridians. Therefore, most cases of腰痛 (lower back pain) are due to deficiency of the true yin, and the main focus should be on nourishing kidney qi. Of those who have true pathogenic factors causing腰痛, it is merely two or three out of ten. </p>
<p>In cases of腰痛 with deficiency, it is nine out of ten. One should observe that there is neither exterior pathogen nor damp-heat, and it may be caused by aging, overexertion, indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures, or mental distress resulting from emotional turmoil, all of which belong to true yin deficiency. </p>
<p>For all deficiency signs, the complexion must be clear, though it may also appear dark; the pulse should be soft and gentle, but it can be subtle. Whether due to inability to stand or walk (which may lead to less rest while lying down) or due to fatigue and weakness that worsens with labor, all such gradual accumulations indicate deficiency; while those that arise suddenly and cause intense pain generally indicate excess. Internal injuries due to constitution are largely insufficient, while externally contracted pathogens are typically in excess. Therefore, the practitioner must discern the underlying causes.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>When there is a deficiency of the kidney&#39;s true yin, leading to a decrease in essence and blood that causes pain, it is best to use Danggui Dihuang Decoction along with Zuo Gui Wan and You Gui Wan. If the condition is slightly lighter, or if the pain and deficiency are not severe, alternatives like Qing&#39;e Wan, Wei Shen San, Bu Sui Dan, Er Zhi Wan, and Tongqi San may be chosen. </p>
<p>For superficial symptoms of lower back pain, any external factors like wind, cold, and dampness that obstruct the meridians affecting the Taiyang and Shayyin channels should be considered. If wind and cold are present in the meridians, the symptoms will likely include alternating chills and fever, a tight and rapid pulse, sudden onset, and pain that is constricting, sour, and radiates up to the spine. It is essential to differentiate between yin and yang, and treatment should aim to disperse. </p>
<p>For yang conditions with predominant heat, it is advisable to use a decoction of Chai Hu or the standard Chai Hu Decoction. For yin conditions with predominant cold, the Two Chai Hu Decoction or Wujisan may be administered.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>There are still matters to address regarding treatments for cold damage. If dampness lingers in the channels resulting in腰痛, it may be due to rain, wet clothing, or sitting/lying on damp ground. Any external dampness entering the body is generally a surface condition, and it is advisable to take formulas like Jin Zheng Qi San or Ping Wei San. If dampness accompanies deficiency, Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang is recommended. If the dampness causes腰痛 and difficulty in urination, Wei Ling Tang or Wu Ling San with Cang Zhu should be administered. If wind-dampness is concurrent, resulting in body pain, Qiang Huo Sheng Shi Tang is suitable. If dampness is combined with heat, formulas such as Dang Gui Nian Tong Tang or Cang Zhu Tang should be used. If dampness is combined with cold, Ji Sheng Zhu Fu Tang or Wu Ji San may be appropriate. Generally,腰痛 has both cold and heat presentations; each presentation has two variations.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>If there is external cold affecting the body, treatment should focus on warming and dispelling it as mentioned before, or one can also use hot objects to apply heat. If the cold is due to internal damage and yang deficiency, then treatment should aim at warming and tonifying as previously stated. There are two types of heat: if there is a deficiency of liver and kidney yin with depletion of fluids and excess fire, the treatment should nourish yin and reduce fire, using the Eight Flavor Decoction or adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Huangqin, and Zhizi to the Four Substance Decoction. If there is pathogenic fire accumulating in the lower back and kidneys, with no inherent deficiency, it will definitely cause severe pain and restlessness, possibly leading to extreme thirst and urinary issues. In this case, one must directly combat the fire with a significant dosage of Qingyin Decoction adjusted as needed.</p>
<p>For injuries causing lower back pain due to falls or impacts, this injury resides in the muscles and bones, leading to stagnation of blood vessels.

<p>Danxi states: For all waist pains, one should not use ginseng to tonify Qi; tonifying Qi will only increase the pain. Neither should one use extreme coldness, as it can cause obstruction and intensify the pain. These statements are incorrect. In general, those with injuries from overexertion and insufficient Yang frequently exhibit signs of Qi deficiency; why should ginseng not be used? Moreover, if heat accumulates in the lower region, causing severe and unbearable pain, it is necessary to clear the heat promptly; why should cold be avoided? However, if there is a combination of deficiency and excess, there are cases where ginseng should not be used; even if there is heat present but it is not severe, excessive cold should also be avoided. If one asserts that it cannot be used in all cases, is this indeed true?</p>

<p>The Zhong Liu Yu points, two located an inch and a half on either side below the 11th vertebra, if moxibusted five times, indicate lower back pain that makes it difficult to bend or stretch, with pain alongside the spine.

<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: According to the &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; for lumbar pain, needling the foot&#39;s Taiyang point relieves pain radiating to the neck, spine, and lower back. The three methods involve needling the valley to draw blood, two methods involve drawing blood from the foot&#39;s Taiyang point as well.</p>
<p>The Classic states: If the pathogen is in the kidneys, symptoms include abdominal distention, lumbar pain, difficulty with bowel movements, and pain in the shoulders, back, and neck, often accompanied by dizziness; treat the Yongquan (Gushing Spring) and Kunlun (Kunlun Mountains) points, and withdraw blood as necessary. This treatment draws blood from both the foot&#39;s Taiyang and Shaoyin channels. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is stated that the channel of the foot&#39;s Taiyang, when disturbed, can cause dizziness and headaches; hence, one should observe the balance of Taiyang, whether it is strong or deficient in heat or cold, to determine needling techniques for immediate adjustment.</p>
<p>For lumbar pain in the foot’s Shaoyin channel, needle along the inner side of the spine to draw blood from the foot&#39;s Shaoyin channel. The Classic notes that the branch of the foot&#39;s Shaoyin is called the &quot;Great Bell,&quot; located behind the ankle, circling near to the Taiyang. If there is deficiency, lumbar pain results, so treating the branch is necessary to nourish the foot&#39;s Shaoyin network.</p>
<p>For lumbar pain, needling shouldn&#39;t be done while bending or looking upwards; three methods from the Shaoyang and Yangming channels all involve bloodletting.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>The classic text states: The liver foot jueyin meridian, when it moves, causes pain in the lower back, making it impossible to bend or look up. This should be treated by assessing the conditions of deficiency or excess, cold or heat, and applying tonification or sedation techniques, along with moxibustion for regulation. To treat pain in the lower back radiating to the lower abdomen (the lesser moon), one cannot look up; the needling is applied at the waist-hindquarters junction, with three references in the classic texts, of which this is one. The Treatise on Acupuncture states: Pain in the lower back radiating to the lower abdomen (the lesser moon) makes it impossible to lie back. Needling the solution at the waist-hindquarters, above the two tendons, is known as the lumbar shu point, using the cyclical rhythm of the moon to guide the treatment, alternating needling left and right. Furthermore, the Treatise on Bone Cavities states: Pain in the lower back prevents turning or shaking, quickly affecting the lower yin; needling the eight sacral points along with the area of pain, located at the waist-hindquarters junction. These three sections of classic texts have largely similar meanings and share a unified method. Additionally, the liver foot jueyin meridian, upon movement, causes lower back pain, making it impossible to bend or look up. The conditions of excess or deficiency and heat or cold can be assessed for treatment; hence while the symptoms are the same, the treatment methods differ.</p>
<p>For treating lower back pain, there are three main approaches: one is related to the yangming channel; if pain radiates to the shoulder with urinary issues, needling the solution point is done at the muscular and tendon junction outside the xie; if pain radiates to the nape and spine with stiffness or risk of collapsing, needling the foot taiyang at the yong point is indicated. For lower back pain, the section discusses six methods at the foot taiyang channel point in the middle of the popliteal area. The popliteal area is at the back of the knee, situated between the two tendons, horizontally within the popliteal cavity.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>The two methods of the Taiyin channel involve needling the central point of the Hui to induce bleeding. The two methods of resolving the pulse involve needling the horizontal line through the Hui to induce bleeding. One method to balance the collaterals involves needling a few inches above the Hui to induce bleeding. One method at the Hui involves needling five inches below to induce bleeding.</p>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing lower back pain, needle the kidney point, measuring with a stick level with the navel, one and a half inches away from the spine on each side, and moxibustion for twenty-seven times. Also needle the Renzhong and Weizhong points.</p>
<p>For tight lower back pain, moxibustion at Mingmen for twenty-seven times, targeting the space between the fourteenth vertebrae, press down to take it, needle Kunlun for sedation, and use moxibustion for sedation as well.</p>
<p>For sudden energy stagnation resulting in back pain that prevents bending or stretching, needle Zhi Shi five fen, and once obtaining qi, sedate it; also needle the Xing Jian point.</p>
<p>For internal pulling pain in the lumbar spine that prevents bending or extending, if the pain is higher, take He Gu, and if lower, take Kun Lun and Fu Liu.</p>
<p>For unbearable pain in both the lumbar and spinal areas, needle Feng Chi, He Gu, and Kun Lun.</p>
<p>Another method includes Feng Chi, Cheng Shan, He Gu, Lu Xi, and San Jian.</p>
<p>For sensations resembling spasm in the lumbar spine, needle Yong Quan by one fen, Yin Gu by one and a half inches, Jing Gu by one fen, and Xing Jian by five fen.</p>
<p>For back pain from twisting or impacting, needle Chi Ze and avoid moxibustion. Also needle Weizhong, Renzhong, Yang Ling Quan, Shu Gu, Kun Lun, and Xia Liao.</p>
<p>For chronic kidney deficiency pain that does not resolve, needle Jian Jing and Shen Xu by five fen, retaining the needle for seven breaths, and apply moxibustion according to the course of the year. </p>
<p>For lower back pain where needling does not stabilize, needle Ba Liao.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>Severe lower back pain, which recurs after acupuncture, leads to a sensation of heaviness in the lower back making it difficult to lift the body. One can puncture the Weizhong point to stop bleeding. </p>
<p>For lower back pain felt at the front of the body, use the foot Yangming source point; at the back, use the foot Taiyang source point; to the side of the body, use the foot Shaoyang source point. </p>
<p>For acute lower back pain, needle the Qihai point; for overweight individuals, insert the needle one inch deep, and for those who are thin, five-tenths. Alternate between reinforcement and draining techniques to relieve the pain, making the patient feel the pain in the upper and lower abdomen before removing the needle. After a pause of twenty-five breaths, press firmly on the point with the left hand while inserting the needle with the right for three breaths; pause again for twenty-five breaths and repeat, making the patient feel the warm energy from the external kidneys rising into the lower abdomen; then remove the needle for effective relief. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compilation&quot; states: for lower back pain, one should use the method of lightning fire needles. On the fifth day of the fifth month, take a peach branch, trim both ends like an egg, and use it as a needle about an inch long. Ignite the needle at a flame, and, using three or five layers of paper, apply it to the affected area, pressing the needle onto the paper. For deep-seated issues, reignite the needle for immediate improvement. Recite: &quot;Heavenly fire, earthly fire, true fire of Samadhi; with the needle, heaven opens, the earth splits, and the needle extinguishes spirits. Those who receive this needle attain longevity, all ailments are eliminated, and countless diseases are eradicated. I follow the command of the Supreme Laojun urgently as per the law.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: for lower back pain, mild cases can be treated by bleeding from Weizhong; for severe cases, tonify Huantiao and drain Weizhong; for chronic pain, both points should be tonified. </p>
<p>For lower back pain that radiates to the back, needle the Kunlun and Weizhong points.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>Lower back pain connected to the legs, supplement with wrist bones, and drain the point Zusanli.<br>Lower back pain connected to the feet, supplement with Huantiao, and drain Fengshi, Xingjian, and Zusanli.

<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: For back pain guidance, sit facing east, collect the hands to embrace the heart. One person holds both knees in the front, and another supports the head from behind. Gradually pull to lie down, with the head touching the ground, rise and lie down three times, repeat this for a long time to be effective. The &quot;Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states: When qi and blood are weak, it is related to the kidneys; various cold factors draw in, all belong to weakness of kidney water qi, which may lead to back pain. In winter, when water is abundant, it is advisable to practice breathing techniques and regulate the flow of air. Avoid cold and favor going to bed early. Generally, in winter, the energy is retracted and closed, reaching extreme cold; one should regulate desires to nourish the initial growth of yang. For yin and yang to unite, the essence must harmonize; all things are subtly grounded and should not be shaken. If you maintain this, you will preserve your longevity without bounds. Back pain guidance: let the fire of the kidney bring warmth, or rub the heated palms on the painful area. For lumbar wind soft guidance: raise the fire in the kidneys to warm the back, then transfer this heat down to the kidneys.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Records of the Historian&quot; in the biography of Cang Gong states: The brother of King Huang Ji of Qi, Huang Changqing, hosted a banquet for guests, as was the custom. While the guests were seated but had not yet begun to eat, I noticed the younger brother of the queen, Song Jian, and informed him: &quot;You have been ill for four to five days, experiencing pain in your lower back and flanks. You cannot bend or stretch, nor can you urinate. If not treated urgently, this condition will affect your kidneys, compromising your five vital organs. Immediate care is essential. The illness you currently have is an obstruction in the kidneys, which is known as kidney wind.&quot; Song Jian acknowledged this. He had indeed suffered from back pain for four to five days; due to the rainy weather, the people of the Huang family were playing with stones near his house, and he too desired to emulate them, but he was unable to rise after attempting. By evening, his back pain worsened, and he could not urinate; he remains unwell to this day. </p>
<p>For his condition, I conclude that he must maintain a careful demeanor. Therefore, I observed his symptoms and noted that his complexion had a dry, sunken hue, and that the area above his kidneys and below his waist appeared withered. This indicates that I recognized his onset four to five days earlier. I prescribed a gentle decoction for him, and after eighteen days, he recovered.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the maidservant of the King of Jibei, Han, who suffered from back pain coupled with cold and heat symptoms, many doctors diagnosed it as a cold-heat condition. However, upon feeling her pulse, I observed internal cold, which correlates with her menstruation being absent. I adjusted her medication swiftly, and her condition improved immediately. The reason for her illness was a desire for a male child that was unfulfilled. Therefore, while diagnosing Han’s illness, I noted that when feeling her pulse, I checked her kidney pulse, which was weak and not connected, indicating difficulty with her condition, hence her menstruation was not coming. The liver pulse, detected at the left inch, indicated her desire for a male child that could not be obtained.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>The &quot;Rituals of the Confucian School&quot; states: A servant girl of Dai, while traveling in winter, arrived with her face red as fire. Upon reaching (Shuiyin), she suffered severe pain in her waist and experienced urgency with a heavy sensation in her lower abdomen, and when the pain occurred, she claimed to see spirits. Dai, the physician, said: This pertains to the Shaoyang channel; the fire is located at the side of the body. He prescribed medicinal pills and decoction to harmonize the channels, and after several purgative treatments, the illness had not yet healed. People were puzzled and thought she was possessed. Dai, in anger, exclaimed: It’s a donkey spirit! He then adjusted the gastrointestinal harmonizing decoction and combined it with one measure of the powdered root of the Qian Niu Tou, cooking and administering it. The treatment induced a plentiful cramping, about one or two bowls in total, and then she cast aside her cane, only feeling thirst. Dai allowed her to drink as much water as she wanted, along with watermelon, pears, and persimmons, saying: In treating fire, nothing compares to ice. Water is the ultimate form of yin from heaven and earth. After drinking one or two buckets, she still felt slight pain. Dai then needled her Yanglingquan point to relieve the stagnation, which is the point on the foot corresponding to the Shaoyang gallbladder channel. From this treatment onward, she felt at ease. The maidservant then mentioned: Every year, I must purge five or six times; this year I haven&#39;t purged, which is why I feel this way.常仲, understanding her words keenly, realized that due to her damp illness, he also must purge more than ten times a year, thus the onset of his ailment. This can be discussed with the wise, but is difficult to explain to the foolish.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>The patient suffers from a painful lower back and hips, making it difficult to walk or ride. Some treat it as a case of cold dampness affecting the feet, while others see it as a deficiency. Various invigorating and blood-stimulating medicines, including black, aconite, motherwort, and myrrh, were used extensively. After over sixty days, the symptoms persisted: red eyes, internal heat, and troubled urination, while the back and hips remained the same. A physician examined the patient&#39;s pulse and found both wrists to be deep and slow, indicating an internal issue that required purging. Administered were doses of Zhou Che Wan and Jun Chuan San, eliminating over twenty blocks of stagnant water. After a morning meal of thin rice porridge and some horse, the patient regained significant vitality.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>A man over sixty years old suffered from pain in his lower back, hips, and spine, which had persisted for several years without relief. He experienced quiet during the day but restless nights, with severe pain coming and going, leading him to repeatedly seek to end his life. His pain intensified in the evening, requiring others to strike him with a pestle, but it would gradually reduce by the time the rooster crowed at dawn, and cease by morning. Those around him, as well as the patient himself, believed that spirits and supernatural beings were punishing him with the bite of a white tiger. They prayed fervently day and night, causing shamans, monks, and practitioners of various religious disciplines to come, which seemed to alleviate his pain. He also dreamed of battles among spirits, and offered sacrifices to every mountain, river, and shrine without exception. As time passed, he became emaciated and dehydrated, his appetite diminished, and his anger grew, as he awaited death.</p>
<p>A scholar suggested that since the trouble stemmed from the spirits and the biting of the tiger, despite their prayers, there had been no response. He heard of a man named Zhang Dai from Chen County, skilled in medicine, and suggested consulting him about his affliction from the white tiger and the spirits. If he lacked a solution, he could entrust his fate. The man’s family followed this advice. Zhang Dai examined his pulse, which was heavy, stagnant, and rigid, with a strength similar to that of a stretched bow. He informed them: despite the man&#39;s emaciation and difficulty in eating, the pain in his lower back, hips, and spine indicated that his bowel movements were likely hard and dry.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>His attendants said: &quot;After five to seven days, or even eight to nine days, we saw small hard lumps of dry feces, like pellets, which were so hardened that they could not be described. We had someone fetch them, and after forcibly taking out one or two lumps, the patient experienced dryness and itching all over, with the skin peeling and becoming as dehydrated as dried dough. Once we understood the patient&#39;s condition, we used a major purgative decoction boiled with ginger and jujube and added two qian of the powdered root of the qian niu tou (milk vetch). We dared not call it a purgative. It was because the patient found warmth pleasurable and feared the cold; when we said it would be nourishing, he accepted it, but when we mentioned purging, he resisted. Such a condition does not develop overnight, especially when surrounded by those who supported him, and the people of Chu encouraged him. After boiling the mixture, we allowed him to swallow it slightly warm, starting with small amounts and gradually increasing over three days. By the evening of that third day, the organs had expelled four to five liters, about half a basin. Upon inspection by lantern light, the liquid consisted entirely of dry feces, hard masses, and stagnant blood—filthy and unapproachable. In a short while, the pain reduced by nine-tenths, and he fell into a deep sleep, breathing regularly like a normal person. By the next day towards evening, he felt hungry and asked for porridge, which we gave him warm. After one or two more days of rest, all his pain had entirely healed. Next, we advised him to adjust his diet for nourishment and to take the dao shui wan (water guiding pills) and gan lu san (sweet dew powder), medicines that promoted smooth urination and defecation. It took more than forty days for him to fully recover. Once the illness was cured, he lived to be eighty years old. Therefore, all dry conditions are considered illnesses of the three yang.&quot;<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The northern man, Wei Dexin, encountered a diagnosis of illness at Xijiang during the winter months, suffering from coldness and persistent back pain, unable to bend or stretch. His legs felt heavy, making it difficult to walk, so he was carried on a bed along the way. Upon consulting doctors, they all stated it was due to kidney deficiency, recommending the use of herbs like cistanche, bark of the Baijiguo, aconite, and deer antler. However, he experienced constipation and tidal fever for almost a year, so he sought help from Doctor Dai. Doctor Dai remarked that this illness would show improvement in ten days, to which Wei replied that a month would not be too late. </p>
<p>Doctor Dai explained that when the kidney&#39;s energy in the foot yang meridian is excessive, it can lead to back pain as if it were broken, causing stiffness in the knees and discomfort in the lower back. The cold from the yang meridian obstructed the body, making bending and stretching difficult. Moreover, the lower back is the house of the kidneys and a vital joint in the body. Given its rigidity and hindrance, it should be softened. When taken suddenly, the body would become harmonious and flexible. </p>
<p>The Nan Jing states: If one engages in strong physical activity, the kidneys can be harmed, and marrow may dry up, leading to damage to the bones, which is similar to this case. In Wei&#39;s condition, the yang meridian was obstructed by cold, causing stagnation of blood in the lower back. This was not merely kidney deficiency. </p>
<p>Following a regimen with medication over several hundred dosages, roughly one or two bean measures of blood were drawn. After that, he was treated with steaming from a special stove, resulting in sweating three to five times which led to recovery. Initially, after five days of steaming, Doctor Dai inquired if there was any sound from the stomach. Wei replied no, but by the sixth day, he felt it gurgling, and by the seventh day, he was able to greet others respectfully. Doctor Dai cautioned that those with heat should avoid steaming, as it could harm the eyes.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>Zhao Jin, the wine supervisor of Xicheng, suffered from chronic lower back pain for over a year without improvement. His pulse was deep, strong, and solid. He used a formula containing Tong Jing San and took five to seven doses. Next, he prepared a fine powder of prepared Eucommia Bark, cutting it finely after removing the coarse skin, and took three qian (a measurement) each time. He took one pig kidney, sliced it thinly into five to seven pieces, and marinated it with pepper and salt to remove the fishy smell. He mixed the medicine inside, wrapped it in lotus leaves, and securely covered it with wet paper numerous times, then cooked it with both gentle and intense fire until done. He chewed it finely before lying down, washing it down with warm wine. Every morning, he took a dose of Wubi Shanyao Wan, and after a few days, he was cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: In the last year of winter, Cao Tongfu came from Henan and found a laborer named Xiao Zhai who had to sleep in a cold and damp place. He suffered from back pain and was unable to turn over, with acute pain in both sides. He had already been suffering for more than a month without improvement. The discussions on back pain indicate that this is due to coagulated blood in the blood vessels of the foot&#39;s yangming and shaoyin, with one or two cases belonging to the shaoyang gallbladder channel. Only by resolving the blood coagulation could he be cured. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In the winter months, one should avoid using needles and should only take medicine to unblock the meridians and break the stagnant blood within the vessels.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: Xu Zhifu, sixty years old, fell off a horse and suffered from back pain, making it impossible to turn. His six pulses were scattered and large, but when re-examined, they were thin and slightly firm. I believed that although there was stasis of evil blood, it should not be forcibly expelled, and first needed to replenish and reconnect. Therefore, I prescribed a decoction of sandalwood, ginseng, astragalus, chuanxiong, angelica, tangerine peel, and licorice, which he took for half a month. Gradually, the scattered pulses became more stable, and his appetite improved. I then combined these herbs with natural copper and others, and after a month, he was well.</p>
<p>Yiyi&#39;s niece, who initially recovered from intermittent fever, suffered from back pain and turbid discharge due to being exposed to wind. She had already been given a tonic with ginseng, poria, betel nut, and pinellia, and I instructed her to take one qian of calcined oyster, five fen of houttuynia, and three fen of fried woad, ground coarse, and to combine these with the previous prescription. She recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: In the eighth month of the Wuxu year, there were severe floods in Huainan, and the city was submerged for months. I suddenly felt an imbalance in my organs, with a roaring sensation in my abdomen like water. After several days of treatment, I recovered. Since then, I have experienced persistent back pain, making it difficult to bend, and even washing my face was troublesome. I took all kinds of medications without effect for three months. I later realized that this must have been due to an excess of water and cold dampness affecting the kidney meridian. I then performed moxibustion on the kidney shu point three times, and took deer antler pills, which led to my recovery.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>&quot;The Essentials of Medical Principles&quot; states: A person who was overly fatigued and excessively drank alcohol developed damp-heat that invaded the channels, resulting in waist pain, which worsened at night, making it impossible to bend or look up, with a pulse that was slippery and weak. Initially treated with the Pain Relief Decoction, removing ginseng and atractylodes, showed slight improvement, so the prescription was changed to Four Substance Decoction with additional Eucommia, Achyranthes, Angelica, and Cinnamon, leading to complete recovery.</p>
<p>Another person, stout and experiencing pain in their joints, especially their waist, had a pulse that was deep, slippery, indicating damp phlegm. I prescribed the Two Chen Decoction with Nanshin, Atractylodes, and Qinghao, and after ten doses, recovery was achieved.</p>
<p>One person presented as overweight, frequently feeling cold in the waist. I administered Kidney Nourishing Decoction with Nanshin and Atractylodes for three doses, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A different individual suffered persistent waist pain after falling from a horse, with the pain worsening at night. The presence of stasis blood was confirmed; I prescribed the Four Substance Decoction, removing Rehmannia, and added Cinnamon, Peach Kernel, Safflower, and Woodsophora for four doses. Subsequently, blood was expelled from the stool, leading to healing.</p>
<p>Yet another person had a history of athlete&#39;s foot, where each flare-up would evoke waist pain, making movement difficult. This individual enjoyed drinking heavily, clearly indicating damp-heat, with a pulse that was slippery and rapid. After eight doses of the Pain Relief Decoction showed gradual improvement, I provided the Tiger Grasp Pill in wine, taking two pills on an empty stomach across three days. This resulted in black sweat from the legs and ankles, with no recurrence.</p>
<p>&quot;The Miraculous Effective Formulas&quot; notes: The Prefect of Zhongzhou, Chen Feng, consumed cool foods due to summer heat and suddenly in autumn experienced pain in the right waist and leg, extending to the knee, which severely limited movement for a month. Various medications aimed at treating the waist and legs were ineffective until he took the Kidney Nourishing Powder, which showed immediate results. After one dose, he could move his entire body. After another dose, he could flex and extend his legs, and one more dose led to complete health restoration.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>One person suddenly experienced pain in both feet and the waist, with a tight pulse and dryness. This condition indicates a simultaneous invasion of wind and cold, with cold being more pronounced. One could use the kidney-nourishing powder from the &quot;Bai Yi Xuan Fang&quot; with good effect. Li Fengyi also once told me that in his family, there was a woman who could not move her waist or legs, and this medicine worked immediately. This is indeed a case of simultaneous wind and cold invasion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: A man over forty suffered from lower back pain; he did not respond to the Liuqi Decoction or the Jisheng Soup. When he applied heat with his hands, it provided some relief. This was due to a deep, tight pulse indicating kidney deficiency, which was cured with kidney-replenishing pills.</p>
<p>Fu Yuncheng&#39;s mother, over seventy, developed a sore on her waist that caused unusual itching; it was suspected to be caused by insect bites. The pulse was floating and rapid. Qishi states that a floating and rapid pulse accompanied by chills indicates sores or abscesses. It was also said: if the surface feels like hemp and the interior feels like melon, the abscess is toxic inside. Upon re-examining the next day, the pulse was weak. I remarked that if the sore had not yet ruptured while the pulse was already weak, how could one expect to contain it? Moreover, with constipation, the vital energy was already depleted, making treatment futile. His son insisted, and with no other choice, I prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Huo Xiang and Shen Qu, slowly advancing diet, and the bowel movement eventually began. Further, a strong tonic was used; when it ruptured, the pus was clear, and upon feeling thirsty, additional herbs—ginseng, astragalus, angelica, cooked rehmannia, ophiopogon, and schisandra—were used to stop the thirst. Yuncheng happily said, &quot;My mother should be fine now.&quot; I disagreed, stating that it could not be contained, echoing the words of my predecessors. He was doubtful and soon sought other doctors, ultimately to no avail.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>A woman from the Lu family, upon her first marriage, suffered from lower back pain without swelling, her pulse was deep and slippery, and she felt fatigued. This was caused by the internal onset of the seven emotions&#39; fire and the toxins from food. A decoction of herbal medicine was given, resulting in a discharge of pus. Chen Liangfu noted that if lesions had not yet ruptured but were inwardly festering, with a pale face and dark lips, they were untreatable. In fact, she passed away.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanzhong from Kunshan, who was a scholar, suffered from a back sore in late summer; the sore was the size of a large bean, with a root about three inches long, slightly swollen and reddish, exhibiting all signs of deficiency. Moxa was applied to the painful area using mulberry branches, and he took a dose of Lifesaving Decoction, which reduced the swelling and redness, although his appetite remained poor. Then he was given a restorative herbal formula of Xiangsha Liu Junzi Tang in four doses, gradually increasing his food intake. Later, he used a highly nourishing medicine. Although pus formed, it did not rupture. He added one slice of Aconite to each dose of the nourishing medicine, and eventually, the pus flowed out on its own, leading to recovery in ten days.</p>
<p>A woman, suddenly enraged, developed a swelling on her lower back, with chest distress, experiencing occasional pain as qi surged. After taking several doses of Feng Mai Liu Qi Decoction, her pain ceased. She then took Xiaochaihu Decoction with modifications, adding Xiangfu and Fritillaria to the Four Substance Decoction, and after a month, she recovered.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>A woman suffered a small lesion on her waist, flesh-colored as usual, without ulceration or heat. I advised that it should be treated with tonifying qi and nourishing the body, along with herbs to relieve depression. Her family did not believe this and instead took a remedy for wind. Later, it ruptured and discharged pus, and she passed away after a year.</p>
<p>A man, nineteen years old, had a lump on his waist that was headless and painless, with no change in color, and it did not ulcerate for three months. He had little appetite and was losing weight. This was due to cold obstructing the pores, causing the qi to stagnate and leading to swelling, which was termed damp toxin. The &quot;Yuanrong&quot; text states that when a person has poor appetite, weakened essence, and diminished qi and blood, with wasted muscles and obstructed protective qi, the cold blocks the pores, causing stagnation that results in abscesses and swelling. Such cases should be treated by supplementing the weak qi. Thus, I prescribed Shen Qi Wan with additional Xiang Fu and Chen Pi for over thirty doses. I then applied acupuncture, which led to the discharge of about two bowls of white pus. The previous herbs were adjusted with doubled quantities of Ren Shen and Huang Qi, and moxibustion with Dou Chi cake was used, leading to gradual recovery. However, the patient was misguided by those seeking rapid results and took a poison-expelling remedy internally and applied cooling herbs externally, which worsened his condition, leading to reduced appetite and thin pus, with the affected area turning purple. He returned for further treatment. Delighted that his spirit had not been lost, I used the previous formula, adding Yuan Zhi, Bei Mu, and Bai Lian, and after a hundred doses, he recovered. If such a sore does not heal for a long time or if the pus is clear and thin, it should be treated with an internal obstructive dispersing remedy and moxibustion with Fu Zi cake, then recovery is possible. However, if one does not carefully manage diet, daily activities, and emotions, it cannot be treated.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>Liu Wentong, over twenty years old, had a bulge about an inch wide at his waist, the color remained flesh-toned, with slight pain but no ulceration, and it felt warm with a strong pulse. This was due to emotional distress that had injured him, leading to stagnation of qi and blood, much like a blockage in a tunnel. He should tonify qi and blood, unblock the stagnation, and apply a poultice of dried ginger to promote the free flow of qi and blood, so that the internal issue could disperse; even if it did not disappear, it would pose no danger. He did not heed this advice and instead took ten prescriptions to expel qi, which only made his qi and blood even more deficient, leading to the discharge of clear pus without cessation, resulting in his death.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>A man suffered from a toxic affliction in his waist, with pus that had ripened but not broken. After being needled, the pus discharged greatly, but he became increasingly restless. Four doses of Shengyu decoction calmed him, and further doses of Ren Shen Yang Rong decoction, combined with Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi over two months, brought about healing. Later, he suffered from dampness, which became a chronic ailment. Whenever pus, blood, and other discharges are copious, and the wound is slow to close, it is especially important to replenish and nurture, ensuring that qi and blood recover. Otherwise, he may develop other conditions that will be difficult to treat; caution is advised!</p>
<p>Another man experienced toxins in his waist that manifested but did not break, with qi and blood being stagnated without the ability to turn into pus. After a few doses of potent tonics, the area finally erupted. Following several more doses, the pus remained clear. He then consumed a mixture of Ren, Qi, and Gui Zhi preparations, resulting in less viscous pus. Gradually, the pus became thicker, and muscle tissue began to form. In cases of large boils and abscesses, the condition primarily relies on qi. If an affliction arises without eruption or if it ruptures without rotting or fails to congeal—with pus being minimal or clear—it indicates a deficiency in qi and blood. Therefore, it warrants significant tonification while strictly avoiding aggressive medications. There are cases where pus reverts to being copious, indicating that the deficiency in qi and blood prevents control. If, after rupture, one experiences fever and thirst with a strong pulse and increasing pus, it pertains to genuine qi deficiency with excess pathogenic influence and will not heal effectively. </p>
<p>It is common to see robust individuals with conditions that lead to swollen, red lesions which easily rot and have viscous pus, making them easier to congeal. In contrast, weaker people often do not erupt, rot, or close easily. Should one recklessly administer aggressive treatments without careful examination, the risk of collapse and other complications becomes inevitable. After suffering from such conditions, one must focus on recovery, especially in cases resembling nodular or exudative ailments, where nourishment is particularly critical. Otherwise, one may develop additional complications that will be difficult to treat; caution is advised!<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>The official Zhang Biyai suffered from a carbuncle at his waist. He entered the room inebriated, with a pulse that was rapid and strong, and the pain intensified. I advised against treatment. As he was about to board a boat, his son insisted he stay, and shortly thereafter he vomited foul-smelling blood, five or six bowls&#39; worth. I suspected that this was due to deficiency in the kidney channel leading to chaotic blood flow; the blood would inevitably escape through the gaps between his teeth. I decided to use herbs such as cinnamon to tonify the kidneys and restrain the fire, preparing them for use. Once the bleeding stopped, I wiped his teeth and confirmed my suspicion. I then gave him a dose of cold medicine, which immediately alleviated his thirst. After a while, I administered a dose of warm medicine; his pulse became weak and his breathing shallow. After receiving the medicine, his pulse improved slightly but eventually became weak again. His son, suspecting there might be pus inside, wanted to puncture it. I said there was surely none. In the end, with a goose feather, it was confirmed to be just as I had predicted. The next day, his pulse was weak, his feet cold up to the knees, and his abdomen felt as if it were made of ice. I urgently applied a remedy of Six Gentleman Pills with ginger and Aconite, which warmed the abdomen and led to the beginning of pus discharge, with the sore seemingly healing. Since the attendants all loved his concubine, he also suffered from urinary obstruction; his yin was weak and sought release of essence, but the essence within had deteriorated and could not escape. I administered a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill, adding ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes. Although his urination improved, the wound did not close and he eventually perished.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>The official from the prefectural school, Peng Bixi, suffered from a腰疽 (a type of sore). He took cold, detoxifying medicine, yet his complexion was dark and without pain, the sore resembling a layer of millet. He felt heavy in the back and could not sleep, his hearing was diminished, his eyesight cloudy, and his face lacked vitality. He experienced frequent, difficult urination, thirst, and a sense of confusion. His breathing was coarse and shallow, with a rapid pulse that felt faint under pressure. </p>
<p>I initially prescribed a remedy to nourish the kidney water, and after a while, he felt relief from thirst and his back felt lighter. Then I used needles to remove the stagnant blood and applied about half a jin of mugwort for moxibustion on the affected area. I also applied a medicinal ointment and internally prescribed ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, and cinnamon. After several doses, his vital energy slightly recovered. </p>
<p>However, he doubted the warming properties of cinnamon and stopped using it for a day. Subsequently, his hands and feet became cold, and he could not maintain regular bowel movements. I then increased the dosage of cinnamon and added two qian of psoralen and one qian of nutmeg. His bowel movements returned to normal, but the sore began to fester. I then used angelica ointment to promote flesh regeneration and prescribed Eight Treasures Decoction to replenish his vital energy and blood, resulting in his recovery.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>The scholar Gu Dongxi had long suffered from thirst and, in early June, developed a sore on his waist. Due to carelessness in his daily activities, the wound festered, became about a foot in size, dark in color, and emitted a foul smell. His urination resembled dribbling, his lips cracked, and his tongue felt prickly. By the end of July, his left wrist pulse was rapid and strong, and the pulse at his left guan position was superficial and weak. I believed that the initial thirst followed by the sore indicated that the kidney&#39;s water had dried up, resulting in deficient fire rising upward, making recovery unlikely. The pus was foul-smelling, dark in color, and painless, with the wound wide open, indicating that the spleen&#39;s energy had deteriorated and kidney water was exhausted. The rapid and strong left wrist pulse signified the kidney&#39;s inability to produce anything. The weak and superficial left guan pulse indicated lung overacting on the liver. Furthermore, during this time of metal flourishing, the situation was perilous. Two days later, he indeed passed away. This condition, having manifested from external factors for two months before his death, showed that his original qi was too weak to consolidate itself. If timely regulation and nourishment had been provided to prevent depletion of his qi and blood, there might have been a chance for survival.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Gate Law&quot; states: Zhang Ling&#39;s younger brother suffered from typhoid fever leading to severe symptoms, weakening both loins, causing him to lie in bed crying out in pain throughout the night. After many treatments failed, he sought a diagnosis from me. His pulse was steady and showed no signs of illness, yet his pain had significantly decreased compared to before. I said, &quot;This illness is not fatal, but I fear he may become incapacitated.&quot; The key to this condition lies in the pain that feels like a stabbing, indicating a struggle between the pathogenic and vital forces. If there were no pain at all, the pathogenic and vital forces would merge into one, coexisting without issue. Now that the pain perception has greatly diminished, it is indeed concerning and requires prompt treatment. The patient responded, &quot;Since my body is already weakened, it would be better to die quickly.&quot; I furrowed my brow, wanting to save him but lacking a treatment method. After contemplating for a long time, I concluded that the pathogen had deeply penetrated both loins, causing blood vessels to close off for a long time and preventing proper circulation. The only method left was to disperse it. However, since the pathogen had been present for so long and the vital energy was completely exhausted, any aggressive treatment would likely be ineffective. Thus, I prescribed a modified version of the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Decoction, adding a large dosage of cinnamon and aconite. After taking it, the patient was able to rise with strength. I then followed my earlier intention to form it into pills, and after taking them for ten days, he was completely well. This was not a method already tested by previous practitioners, but rather a timely adaptation; however, it had been effective in the past. In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s treatment of chest blockage, there is a method using Aconite and Rhubarb, which originally combines these two ingredients. However, in cases with excess energy above, this method is used to drain the heart. In contrast, for cases with excessive blood below, one cannot simply emulate its intention and combine peach kernel and cinnamon to disperse the blood stasis in the loins, can one? Later, Jiang Gusheng, Zhang&#39;s younger brother, suffered from typhoid fever with similar symptoms, and without overthinking, he directly applied this method, recovering after just two doses.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: I once treated an old man named Dong, who was over sixty years old. He had a solid constitution but enjoyed drinking strong liquor, which caused damp heat to accumulate in his lower back. Suddenly, he suffered from unbearable waist pain and even sought to end his own life; it was indeed grave. Upon examination, I found his six pulses to be notably full and slippery, and his urine was not flowing, causing a distended and urgent bladder. Therefore, I prescribed a decoction of clear tea with a double dose of Huangbo and Longdancao. After one dose, his urine flowed freely, and the waist pain vanished as if it had never been. If using Danxi&#39;s approach, one should avoid the cold and cool remedies; otherwise, it would lead to mistakes. Thus, one must not be rigid in treatments.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《素问》云：腰者肾之腑，转摇不能，肾将惫矣。审如是说，则知腰近于肾，多因嗜欲过度，劳伤肾经，肾脏既虚，喜怒忧思，风寒湿毒，得以伤之，遂致腰痛。又有坠堕闪肭，气凝血滞，亦致腰痛。大抵腰痛之病，脉皆沉弦。沉弦而紧者，寒腰痛；沉弦而浮者，风腰痛；沉弦而濡细者，湿腰痛。坠堕闪肭以致气凝血滞而痛者，脉多沉弦而实也。当推其所因，合其脉证以治，无不效者矣。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　　　疮疡全书 【金　窦汉卿】</p>

<p>　　　　　腰痛方论<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p>
<p>　　叙曰：腰者肾之腑，水火之司，有生之根也。善调之，则本固而叶荣；不善调之，则根枯而叶萎。考方四首而治腰之大者见矣。　　肾虚腰痛者，青娥加黄蘗、知母丸主之。盖肾，坎象也，水火病焉，水衰则阳光独治而令肾热，火衰则阴翳袭之而令肾寒，水火俱衰则土气乘之而邪入于肾，均之令人腰痛也。是方也，破故纸、杜仲、胡桃味厚而温，黄蘗、知母、牛膝味厚而寒，温者可使养阳，寒者可使养阴，均之味厚，则均之能走下部矣。若萆薢者苦燥之品，足以利水土之邪而平其气也。曰青蛾者，涵阳之坎也。假之以名方，明其全夫水火之真尔。　　肾气虚弱，肝脾之气袭之，令人腰膝作痛，屈伸不便，冷痹无力者，独活寄生汤主之。盖肾，水脏也，虚则肝脾之气凑之，故令腰膝实而作痛。屈伸不便者，筋骨俱病也。《灵枢经》曰：能屈而不能伸者病在筋，能伸而不能屈者病在骨。故知屈伸不便，为筋骨俱病也。冷痹者，阴邪实也。无力者，气血虚也。<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>是方也，独活、寄生，细辛、秦艽、防风、桂心辛温之品也，可以升举肝牌之气，肝脾之气升，则腰膝弗痛矣。当归、熟地、白芍、川芎、杜仲、牛膝者，养阴之品也，可以滋补肝肾之阴，肝肾之阴补，则足得血而能步矣。人参，伏苓，甘草者，益气之品也，可以长养诸脏之阳，诸脏之阳生，则冷痹而有力矣。　　肾着于湿，腰冷如冰，若有物者，肾着汤主之。盖肾主水，脾主湿，湿胜则流，必归于坎者势也，故曰肾着。腰为肾之腑，湿为阴之气，故令腰冷如冰。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>若有物者，实邪着之也。干姜辛热之物，辛得金之燥，热得火之令，燥能胜湿，旸能曝湿，故象而用之。白朮、甘草甘温之品也，甘得土之味，温得土之气，土胜可以制湿，故用以佐之。白茯苓，甘淡之品也，甘则益土以防水，淡则开其窍而利之，此围师必缺之义也。　　小可腰痛，猪腰、青盐、杜仲方主之。《易》曰：方以类聚，物以群分。故猪腰可以补腰。经曰：五味入口，咸先入肾，故青盐可以就下。杜仲，辛甘益肾之物也。君以猪腰，佐以青盐，则直走肾而补之矣。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The waist is the external organ of the kidneys; if it cannot move or bend, the kidneys will be weak. The pulse of the kidneys, if it is strong and long, and has a yellow and red color, indicates a condition of low back pain. This is because the kidneys are related to the waist, and if the waist is injured, the kidney pulse will be vigorous. If it pushes upwards and does not descend, the waist and feet are clear. This indicates that the energy is strong above and weak below, leading to a cooling effect in the waist and feet. </p>
<p>When pressure reaches the bones and the pulse is weak, there will be pain in the lower back and numbness in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Heart Conditions:</strong></p>
<p>If there is a heart disease, if it is deficient, it will cause pain in the lower ribs and waist. This is because the heart Qi cannot descend and interact with the kidney Yin, thus leading to pain in those areas.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Heat Conditions:</strong></p>
<p>In the case of a cold injury on the first day, the great yang is affected, causing tightness in the head, neck, and lower back. The energy of the sun governs the skin and hair; thus, on the first day of a cold injury, it affects the sun. The yang energy is above, which causes pain in the head and neck, while the back, being of yang nature, results in tightness in the lower back. This describes the onset of disease from the influence of the yang energy.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Malaria:</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of malaria, it first manifests in the fine hairs, with stretching leading to symptoms, chills, and pain in both the lower back and spine. This is because the wei Qi is in agreement with the pathogenic Qi about to enter the Yin, leading to a deficiency in the surface Qi, thus causing initial symptoms in the fine hairs and stretching. If the great yang is deficient, pain will manifest in the lower back and the head and neck.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Emperor said: In cases of illness with sudden turning pale, one examines the right pulse, which is deep and tight, and the left pulse, which is superficial and slow. Otherwise, where lies the cause of the illness? Qi Bo said: In winter, the right pulse should indeed be deep and tight, which corresponds with the four seasons. The left pulse being superficial and slow is contrary to the season. Therefore, the illness on the left indicates that it is associated with the kidney, but also relates to the lungs, so it indicates back pain. The Emperor asked: How can you say this? Qi Bo replied: The Shaoyin pulse connects the kidneys and the lungs; now with the lung pulse being present, the kidney is implicated in the illness, hence the kidney is the cause of back pain.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: The pulse corresponds with the four seasons, hence examining it in winter, both left and right pulses should be deep and tight. Now with the left pulse being superficial and slow, it is contrary to the seasonal energy. The kidneys govern winter energy, and to have it be floating on the left indicates it pertains to the kidneys, while also affecting the lungs, which leads to back pain. Following the principles of the extraordinary and regular channels, beginning with the Taiyin, the five organs are interconnected, whereby the essence derived from water and grains first reaches the hand Taiyin. The Taiyin lung metal generates and smoothly transmits to the kidneys, which should then communicate back to the liver. Now, the manifestation of the floating and slow lung pulse indicates that there is an illness in the kidney, causing the energy to revert contrary to the mother organ, thus indicating kidney-related back pain, while also having implications for the lungs.</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The so-called swelling of the lower back and waist pain in the Taiyang (Greater Yang) refers to the first month when Taiyang is in the Tiger position. The Tiger represents Taiyang. In the first month, the Yang energy emerges from above while the Yin energy is strong; hence, Yang has not yet assumed its proper order, resulting in swollen lower back and waist pain. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: This explains the pulse of a peculiar disease. Taiyang is the master of all Yang energies, originating from the water in the bladder, thus Taiyang&#39;s energy is marked as the beginning of the year. Although the Yang energy emerges from above in the first month, the Yin-cold energy is still strong, and Yang energy has not yet emerged in an orderly manner. Therefore, the swelling of the lower back and waist pain in Taiyang arises because Taiyang’s energy is still obstructed by Yin energy, highlighting the gentleness of Yang energy.]</strong></p>
<p>The so-called waist pain in the Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) refers to the Kidney, as in October, the Yang energy of all things is diminished, thus leading to waist pain.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: In October, the cold water is at work, hence it dominates the Lesser Yin Kidney in the feet.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Needling Essentials</strong></p>
<p>Needling the tendons should not injure the bones; if the bones are injured, this would internally disturb the kidneys. When the kidneys are disturbed, this leads to winter diseases such as swollen waist pain.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: When the kidney energy is disturbed, what is stored becomes deficient, causing the condition to be one of weakness and swelling, resulting in waist pain; the waist is the cavity of the kidneys.]</strong><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Six Elements: A Great Discussion on the Turning of the Celestial Bodies</p>
<p>The government of the Taiyin governs the heavens, and the transformation of qi operates in the post-heavenly phase. The end of qi is characterized by a great rise of cold and a significant transformation of dampness; when affected by the cold, patients experience stiffness in the joints. Pain in the lower back is caused by cold and dampness pushing through the interaction of qi, resulting in illness. [Note: The essence of the end qi is derived from the cold aspect of water; hence the great rise of cold causes the cold and damp qi to intersect from above and below, leading to a significant transformation of dampness and resulting in stiffness of the joints and an obstruction in the bones. The lower back is related to the kidneys, and cold dampness pushes through the interaction of qi, placing individuals in the midst of this interaction.]</p>
<p>The government of the Shaoyin regulates the heavens, and the transformation of qi operates in the pre-heavenly phase. Cold severs the stomach, leading to heart pain, lower back pain, and abdominal distention. The initial qi leads people to react with tightness; they experience stiffness in the joints and lower back pain. [Note: Cold severance, which generates sickness from below, enters the stomach, causing heart pain, lower back pain, and abdominal distention, as cold and heat contest within and cause illness. The initial guest qi is from the cold water of the Taiyang. The initial governing qi comes from the Jueyin wind and wood. Therefore, when the wind arrives, the qi of spring creates stagnation, leading people to react with tightness; the Taiyang governs the kidneys, which are linked to the lower back, thus resulting in stiffness in the joints and lower back pain.]</p>
<p>The manifestation of water stagnation causes the people to suffer from cold-induced heart pain, lower back pain, and difficulty in the major joints, limiting flexion and extension. [Note: The lower back is associated with the kidneys. Flexion and extension of the joints relate to ailments of the muscles and bones; the kidneys govern the bones and the muscles are connected to the joints.] Lower back pain occurs where the Taiyang reaches.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

The kidney meridian is connected to the heart, causing pain to rise to the heart.】 The Taiyin governs the heavens, with an excess of humidity causing swelling and bone pain. In cases of cold obstruction, pressing the affected area yields no relief, with pain in the waist, spine, head, and neck, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the kidneys; if the Taixi pulse is blocked, the condition is fatal and untreatable. 【Note: The Taiyin governing the heavens refers to the year of Chou and Wei. Conditions of swelling and cold obstruction are due to the influence of cold and dampness. In cases of obstruction, they are referred to as &quot;Bi.&quot; The kidneys govern the bones while the bladder corresponds as a partner, hence the pain in the waist, spine, head, and neck.

<p>(Note: The time of Yangming refers to the years of the rabbit and rooster. Throat dryness, facial dust, and back pain are all diseases of the liver meridian.

<p>In the case of the Taiyin, if fire energy becomes internally repressed, dryness manifests as fullness in the lower abdomen and heaviness in the waist. </p>

<p>(Note: The pain in the waist and difficulty in movement is due to excessive water harming itself. The pulling at the lower abdomen and straining the waist and spine that impacts the heart relates to the Jueyin disease, potentially reflecting back on the energies of wood, fire, and earth from a year and a half prior.)</p>

<p>The Bladder Meridian of Foot Taiyang enters directly from the crown to connect with the brain, and runs alongside the spine to the waist; its branches descend from the waist, running alongside the spine to the hips. If this is moved, it causes back pain, as if the waist is broken. [Note: This disease resides in the energy of Taiyang.]</p>

<p>When Yin and Yang are not harmonious, fluids overflow and flow downward to the Yin, and the essence of the marrow is diminished and also descends. Excessive downward flow leads to deficiency; due to deficiency, there is pain in the lower back and soreness in the shins. </p>
<p><em>Note: The disharmony of Yin and Yang refers to the discord between Shaoyin and Yangming. When the Qi of Yin and Yang is not harmonious, the fluids and essence do not unite, causing the fluids to overflow outside the bones and flow downward. When fluids overflow externally, the essence of the marrow is diminished, leading to weakness. Excessive downward flow results in bone deficiency, causing lower back pain and shin soreness, which is the closure of the marrow pathways.</em></p>

<p>When the heart is weak, one experiences palpitations, is restless and sleepless, with pain radiating through the chest, abdomen, and back; they may feel joy or sadness and occasionally become dizzy or fall. The pulse of the left wrist is slightly rapid, and pain in the heart radiates to the back; one cannot eat.

If the kidneys are swollen, they bring fullness and pain to the back, leading to a sensation of heaviness. </p>
<p>When the kidneys lack essence, pain arises that travels along the spine to the waist; hunger diminishes upon feeling full. If the kidney pulse is thin and soft and adheres to the bones, this is indicative. If the kidneys are cold, then there is simultaneous pain in the lower back and spine, with a dark complexion and dry ears, or potentially vomiting blood. Symptoms include difficulty in urination, fullness and hardness below the navel, slurred speech, back pain, heavy legs, and an inability to stand.</p>
<p><strong>Heaviness in the Waist</strong></p>
<p>There is difficulty with urination and defecation, while diet remains unchanged; the waist and legs feel heavy. Checking both radial pulses, if the pulse at the wrist is weak and thin, this indicates lower excess. When urination and defecation are difficult, even as diet fluctuates, if the waist and legs feel heavy as if one is sitting in water, walking becomes laborious, qi surges upward, and dreams are tumultuous, diagnosis shows the pulse at both wrists is slippery and thin, indicating lower deficiency.

<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Pain</strong></p>
<p>There are five causes of waist pain: First, the Lesser Yin, which relates to the kidneys; in the tenth month, the yang energy of all things declines, which causes waist pain. Second, Wind Bi, where wind and cold strike the waist, so there is pain. Third, Kidney deficiency; overexertion harms the kidneys, which causes pain. Fourth, falling and straining the waist leads to pain. Fifth, sleeping on cold ground, harmed by the earth&#39;s energy, induces pain. If the pain does not stop, it pulls on the waist and spine, causing pain. Those with waist and back pain generally suffer from weak kidney energy, especially when lying on cold, damp ground or exposed to wind. If not treated promptly, dampness flows into the legs and knees, resulting in numbness, chilliness, weakness, or heavy pain. If there is waist pain coupled with severely heavy numbness of the legs, one should take the Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Lower Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>When the blood is drained, it leads to lower back pain, akin to being pierced by a nail. Emotional distress that harms the spleen can cause lower back pain; anger that damages the liver also results in lower back pain. For both, it is advisable to use a formula of sandalwood to descend qi along with a qi-regulating powder, adding three slices of ginger and two jujubes for decoction and consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Ji Sheng Fang</strong> (Song, Yan Yonghe)</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: The lower back is associated with the kidneys. If it cannot rotate or sway, the kidneys will become depleted. From this, it can be understood that the lower back&#39;s proximity to the kidneys often results from excessive desires, which injure the kidney meridian. Once the kidneys are deficient, emotions such as joy, anger, and worry, as well as wind, cold, dampness, and toxins, can harm it, leading to lower back pain. Additionally, sudden injuries or strains can cause qi stagnation and blood stasis, also resulting in lower back pain. Generally, the pulses for lower back pain are all deep and tight. A deep and tight pulse indicates cold-related lower back pain; a deep and floating pulse indicates wind-related lower back pain; a deep, thin, and slippery pulse indicates damp-related lower back pain. For those with pain due to sudden injuries causing qi stagnation and blood stasis, the pulse is often deep, tight, and firm. One must identify the underlying causes and reconcile them with pulse and symptoms for effective treatment.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Fire Waistband Poison</strong></p>
<p>This poison affects the heart and liver meridians, heating the poison and injuring the heart. It stagnates in the bladder and becomes blocked in the skin; this is a wind poison. One should use QIng Gan Liu Qi drink and Bai Du Liu Qi powder to treat it, and not apply external medicine casually. For the affected area, use a paste made from purple gold ingot water juice, frequently applying it with an goose feather for moisture.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Dan</strong></p>
<p>The internal dan appears as swelling and redness from below the ribs to the lower back, known as internal dan. If recognized early, it can be treated; if it reaches the waist, it cannot be treated. This condition often leads to dysfunction in urination and defecation, and there may be cases where it results in a dark blue-black color all over the body leading to death within three days. Use emergency dan paste for treatment on the internal dan area, and additionally take Lian Qiao Bai Du powder.</p>
<p><strong>Waist Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition is linked to the yin bao qi acupuncture point, affected by dampness which obstructs the flow of qi and blood, and causes stagnation in the meridians; this is a toxic condition. One should use back-raising medicine for treatment. Within three to five days, it is advisable to perform seven moxibustion procedures to eliminate it.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cold, the intestines are loose, this disease causes diarrhea, leading to pain in the lower back and hips. When affected by wind, it may cause strong pain in the waist and spine. In cases of wind-heat illness, there is stagnation of Qi, muscle and tendon contraction, fatigue, and waist pain. If there is heat in the spleen, heat strikes and the waist pain becomes unbearable, making it hard to bend or stretch. If there is heat in the kidneys, the pain in the waist feels sour and there is bitter thirst. In women, postpartum blood stagnation causes heavy pain in the waist. In the case of febrile disease, when the pathogenic heat is on the surface, it must cause waist pain. When postpartum blood does not flow, menstrual cycles do not occur, there must be blood clots causing pain in the waist. In cases of Taiyang syndrome, there is stiffness in the waist, the pulse is floating with no sweat.</p>
<p>Regarding pain conditions:</p>
<p>For women experiencing pain in the lower back and hips, numbness in the legs, and a preference for warmth over cold, this is due to wind, cold, and damp obstruction. First, one may take around seventy to eighty pills of a damp-removing formula, adjusting dosage according to fullness or emptiness; subsequently, use Yugong powder to induce a discharge of more than ten bowel movements, verifying by the clear and cool excretion of yellow mucous; finally, take coarse water with ginger and jujube boiled together with Pingwei powder to scatter wind-dampness and harmonize blood and Qi.</p>
<p>For all men and women, whether from a single cough or due to sadness and tears, or from lifting heavy objects resulting in sharp waist pain that restricts movement and breathing, one can use a dispersing formula to induce a sneeze; once sweating occurs, the pain will cease. If unable to eat or drink, use Tongjing powder or Daoshui pills to induce more than ten bowel movements; once the discharge is complete, take Wujin pills or He Xue pills, and the pain will lessen and eventually stop.</p>
<p>For elderly individuals with kidney deficiency experiencing pain in the lower back and spine, if the kidneys are affected by dryness, it is crucial since the waist is linked to the kidneys. Acute measures must be taken to rectify kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

This is due to the deficiency of the meridian qi allowing pathogens to invade, hence the emergence of painful illness. The pathogens: wind, heat, dampness, dryness, and cold can all cause illness, but generally, cold and dampness are more prevalent while wind and heat are less common. There are also cases where exhaustion from sexual activity leads to kidney deficiency and back pain; this occurs because the Yang energy is too weak to move. The text says: “The lower back is the organ of the kidneys; if it cannot move or rotate, the kidneys are in decline.” It is advisable to use remedies such as kidney tonic pills or fennel pills to replenish the deficiency of Yang energy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>People who indulge in rich foods and frequently take medicinal potions, when intoxicated, damage their vital energy. This leads to a warming of kidney energy, which results in pain in the lower back and an inability to lift oneself. Over time, this can reduce bone marrow and lead to brittle bones and hair loss, requiring remedies such as Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, Zi Shen Wan, or Feng Sui Dan to replenish the deficiency of yin.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: for lower back pain, if caused by cold, treat the foot’s Taiyin and Yangming meridians; if by heat, treat the foot’s Jueyin, and do not use the Shaoyang meridian for bending and stretching. The three Yang meridians of the foot run from head to foot, while the three Yin meridians run from foot to abdomen; any area they pass can cause pain. Those who treat should carefully examine which meridian path is affected, follow the empty points to perform needling, and assess the nature of cold and heat to determine the appropriate medication.</p>
<p>For instance, if lower back pain is accompanied by a heavy, sluggish sensation in the body, this indicates damp heat within the meridian.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Pain Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>Lower back pain is primarily associated with damp heat, kidney deficiency, blood stasis, strains, and phlegm accumulation. A weak pulse indicates kidney deficiency; in such cases, herbs like Eucommia, tortoise shell, berberine, Anemarrhena, goji berries, and Wu Wei Zi may be ground into powder, with pig spinal marrow to be consumed. A coarse pulse indicates blood stasis, treated with Yin tonics, further mixed with peach kernel and safflower. A slow pulse indicates damp heat, for which herbs like Atractylodes, Eucommia, berberine, and ligusticum can be used. For pain caused by phlegm accumulation, modify the Er Chen Decoction with nanshen and banxia. If the lower back is unable to straighten, needle the Ren Zhong point.  </p>
<p>All kinds of pain are related to heat; therefore, cold and extreme tonics should not be used, and one must resort to warming and dispersing medicines. Ginseng should not be used for pain, as it strengthens Qi, which can exacerbate the pain if Qi becomes abundant but unfree. If there are sudden red spots on the face of a person in pain, it often indicates mortality.  </p>
<p>Lower back pain from damp heat typically flares up in overcast weather or after prolonged sitting. Those with kidney deficiency may experience persistent pain. Blood stasis is characterized by pain that is lighter during the day and worsens at night. The lower back is the external manifestation of the kidneys, essential for bodily movement and function. All meridians connect to the kidneys and influence the lower back; any deficiency in kidney Qi can lead to various issues such as cold invasion, damp accumulation, and heat retention, causing stagnation in blood and Qi, fluid accumulation, and different types of lower back pain.  </p>
<p>If the pulse is taut and deep, it indicates deficiency; if just deep, it signifies stagnation; a coarse pulse shows blood stasis; a slow pulse indicates dampness; and a slippery or hidden pulse relates to phlegm.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing lower back pain, with difficulty in turning to the side, use Da Jian Zhong Tang (Major Construct the Middle Decoction) with ten grains of Chuan Jiao (Sichuan Pepper).

<p>If one experiences waist pain due to wind injury, whether on the left or right side, with pain that has no fixed location and radiates down to the legs, it is advisable to use Wujisan, adding half a qian of Fangfeng with each dose, or adding three whole scorpions is even better. Xiao Xuming Decoction and Duhuo Jisheng Decoction can also be chosen. It is also recommended to swallow Sanxian Dan. Fry Eucommia with ginger juice, grind to a powder, and mix one qian with warm wine to take on an empty stomach; this is known as Eucommia Wine, which treats kidney deficiency-related waist pain and also addresses issues caused by wind-cold.</p>
<h3>Blood Deficiency</h3>
<p>For women who have excessive blood loss, or those who suffer from blood deficiency leading to waist pain, one should enrich their blood.</p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing waist pain, if one cannot turn over and feels weak and lethargic, it is advisable to use the Jianzhong Decoction with ten grains of Sichuan pepper, taking waist kidney pills and raw deer antler pills. Additionally, one should take the Danxi fennel powder mixed with pig kidneys.</p>
<h3>Sprain and Strain</h3>
<p>If the pain is due to a sprain or bruising from impact, it is recommended to take Heishen San mixed with Jiu Yuantong Qi San. If this does not work, there may be stagnant blood, so it is best to first take Suhexiang Wan mixed with wine, then use Wujisan, increasing each dose with half a qian of rhubarb and half a qian of sandalwood, while doubling the amount of Dang Gui. For pain caused by labor and heavy lifting, one should use Heqi Yin or Puxian Zhengqi San.

<p><strong>Back Pain Due to Qi Disorders</strong></p>
<p>There are five types of back pain caused by qi disorders: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cold</strong>: The classics state that when water is stagnant, people suffer from lower back pain, with major joints being unresponsive, causing difficulty in bending and stretching. It also mentions that when the sun arrives, back pain occurs. Furthermore, during the return of the sun, lower back pain can become more pronounced, with difficulty in movement. The treatment is through warming medicinals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dampness</strong>: The classics say that when the Taiyin governs the heavens, dampness descends, and kidney qi rises concurrently, this causes lower back pain with restricted movement. It further mentions that when the sun is at the springs, dampness overrides, resulting in back pain that feels like it is breaking. This too is treated with warming medicinals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Combined Cold and Dampness</strong>: The classics describe that during the governance of the Taiyin, when cold arises significantly and dampness transforms greatly, this leads to stiff joints and lower back pain. The treatment is through drying and heating remedies.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Canon Must-Read</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; pain in the lower back due to solar energy arises from external influences of the six pathogenic qi; while pain in the lower back related to kidney meridian results from internal injury caused by excessive desires. If one were to diligently apply their skills in moderation and maintain the fundamental principles of closure and preservation, then the true qi in the land would be flourishing, and the six qi would be harmful, yet they could not inflict damage. Only by depleting one’s essence and dispersing their true qi would the kidney become deficient and hurt, and how could the bladder, as an organ, stand alone? Hence, the six qi take advantage of the weakness to invade the solar energy, thus necessitating differentiated treatment. There may be cold, damp, wind-heat, strains, blood stasis, stagnant qi, or phlegm accumulation—all of which represent the symptoms, while kidney deficiency remains the root cause. If the symptoms are urgent, treat the symptoms first; if the root is heavy, address the root. By not losing sight of both symptoms and root, the illness cannot escape its manifestation.  </p>
<p><strong>Cold Infection</strong>  </p>
<p>When one contracts a cold and experiences pain, the pulse will surely be tight, with the lower back feeling like ice; warmth will alleviate the pain, while cold will exacerbate it. Use Wujisong Decoction with added Platycodon, or Ginger and Aconite Decoction with added Cinnamon and Eucommia. Additionally, apply liniment externally on the lower back. In the case of concurrent cold-damp conditions, add Atractylodes and Ephedra to the Wujisong Decoction.  </p>
<p><strong>Damp Injury</strong>  </p>
<p>Injury from dampness feels like sitting in water; the kidney is associated with water, and prolonged exposure to dampness from sitting or from rain may cause lower back pain and a feeling of heaviness with a slow pulse. Symptoms will certainly arise in cloudy weather. Use the Shenshi Decoction or Shen Zhaotang; if there are also wind-damp factors, use the Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Sprains and Contusions</h3>
<p>For injuries from falls or impacts, use Ru Xiang for pain relief, and Bai Shen San combined with Fu Yuan Tongqi San, adjusted with wine. If ineffective, there may be bad blood, in which case add Tao Ren and Chuan Shan Jia to Si Wu Tang and Da Huang. For pain caused by labor and heavy lifting, take Shi Bu Tang with Qing E Wan.</p>
<h3>Blood Stasis</h3>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Kidney Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>For new lumbar pain, it is advisable to expel external pathogens and clear damp-heat; if long-lasting, tonify the kidneys and harmonize qi and blood. The lumbar region corresponds to the kidneys and supports the body, allowing for mobility. However, various channels connect with the kidneys and intertwine in the lumbar spine; thus, whether caused by external factors or internal injury, if it is not due to kidney deficiency, the pathogens cannot accumulate. Therefore, one should not use cooling medicines exclusively, nor can one rely solely on ginseng and astragalus to tonify qi. Severe pain accompanied by sudden red spots on the face and a dark area around the philtrum indicates death.</p>
<p><strong>Damp Heat</strong></p>
<p>Long-term exposure to low and moist conditions, combined with the invasion of rain and dew, leads to dampness accumulation, causing the lower back to feel heavy like stone and as cold as ice. Preference for warmth, with no thirst and normal bowel movements, requires adding aconite to a kidney soup. If there is heavy water retention and difficulty in urination, use Wuling Powder or Shenshi Decoction. For heavy lumbar pain, use a single-angle fennel powder. If it lasts long, soak single cow&#39;s knee in wine and take Qing&#39;e pills, adding rhizoma for a better effect. In cases where dampness is combined with heat, especially with summer heat and humidity mingling or due to rich foods causing damp-heat, similar treatments apply. For excess conditions, use the Ermiao Cangbai Powder with Chaihu and Fangfeng decoction. For deficiency conditions, use Qiwwei Cangbai Powder. If the urine is red, use Wuling Powder, Qiangzao Decoction, or Jianbu Pills. For cases where other medicines are ineffective, use Gansui or Qianniú for a strong diuretic effect, as damp-heat is severe. An ancient remedy involves using three qian of Gansui powder cooked with pork kidneys and taken on an empty stomach with wine.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Wind Pathology</h3>
<p>Wind injures the kidneys causing lower back pain, with no fixed direction, affecting the feet and knees, leading to an inability to bend or look around. For wind-heat, use Bai Du San with Du Zhong. If there is difficulty in urination, use Gan Dou Soup with Xu Duan and Tian Ma. For wind deficiency, use Xiao Xu Ming Tang with Tao Ren, or Wu Yao Shun Qi San with Wu Jia Pi. For wind accompanied by cold and dampness, use Wu Ji Jiao Jia San with fried scorpion, Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang, Qiang Huo Sheng Shi Tang, and add modified Long Hu San, or use Dan Wei Ling Xian as a powder mixed with wine.</p>
<h3>Internal Injury from the Seven Emotions</h3>
<p>When one loses their ambition, the heart&#39;s blood does not flourish, failing to nourish the tendons and vessels, causing blockage in the lower back with a feeling of fullness, resulting in weakness and a dark complexion. This makes it difficult to stand for long or travel far. Use Qi Qi Tang with doubled Fu Ling, adding a little Chen Xiang and Ru Xiang. For those who are deficient, hearts and kidneys should be simultaneously nourished; use Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang with Du Zhong and Niu Xi. </p>
<p>All five organs derive Qi from grains, with the spleen being the granary of the stomach. Worry and overthinking injure the spleen, resulting in impaired stomach Qi, lower back pain, and fullness in the abdomen and ribs, which can cause numbness in the flesh. Use Chen Xiang Jiang Qi Tang and Mu Xiang Yun Qi San; if food cannot be digested, use Yi Xiang San. </p>
<p>The reproductive organs gather Qi, and the liver is closely related to the kidneys. Anger injures the liver, leading to relaxation of the tendons, lower back pain, and pain in the ribs. Use Ju Xiang Yin Zi and Tiao Gan San. If there is an external condition along with emotional disturbances, use Ren Shen Shun Qi San, Wu Yao Shun Qi San, and Zhi Gan San with scallion whites, along with Qi Xiang Wan, Qing Mu Xiang Wan, and Li An Wan.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Food Stagnation and Depression</strong></p>
<p>Food accumulation due to overeating and drunkenness leads to damp-heat entering the kidneys, resulting in lower back pain making it hard to bend or stretch. Use Siwu Tang and Er Chen Tang with Malt, Shénqū, Gehua, Sharen, Duzhong, Huangbai, Guangkui, and Zhike. If the pain is severe, use Suyxiao San. For accumulation, use Jiawei Longhu Bi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Damp Heat</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is rapid and tight, or sinking and scattered; the urine is yellow, and there is pain in the lower back that makes it difficult to bend or stretch. When encountering cloudy weather or sitting for a long time, pain occurs, indicating damp heat. It is advisable to drain dampness and clear heat, using a modified Dang Gui Nian Tong Decoction. If there are chills and fever, one should first disperse.</p>
<p><strong>Damp Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is slippery or hidden; there is phlegm with movement, or a lump causing pain, indicating damp phlegm, commonly seen in overweight individuals. It is appropriate to regulate qi and resolve phlegm, using a modified Huophtan Decoction; if ineffective, use Kou Yan Dan gradually. Pain in the lower back is caused by the foot Taiyang channel. Pain in the hips is along the foot Shaoyang gallbladder channel. If caused by injury from cold dampness that obstructs the channels and joints, leading to disharmony of qi and blood resulting in lower back and hip pain, one should use a damp-resolving pill, or a damp-draining decoction with additions of Peony, Qingpi, Cangzhu, and Betel nut. If phlegm stagnates in the channels, use a Phlegm-Resolving Decoction with Betel nut, Qingpi, and Peony. Dan Xi believed in kidney and liver hidden heat, treating with Huangbai and Fangji.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, or both pulses are full, suddenly making it difficult to bend or stretch, indicating sudden back pain. Although it may arise suddenly, there must be some awareness for treatment to be effective. First, grind milk and myrrh finely and mix with wine to drink. Then use blood-activating and qi-moving medicines for recovery. If ineffective, there must be blood stasis; use Wujisan with added Tao Ren, Dahuang, and Su Mu, each a penny&#39;s worth, and double the amount of Dang Gui.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

A modified version of Four Substance Decoction from &quot;Yuan Rong&quot; should be used, possibly adding peach kernel and safflower as the main ingredients.

This treatment is especially applicable when there are bruises or traumas leading to blood stasis. </p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>The pulse is large or both wrists feel strong and full, with persistent pain; this indicates kidney deficiency. It is advisable to nourish the kidney, using Four Substance Decoction with additions of yellow bacopa, eucommia, and herbs like five-flavor fruit. One could take Kidney Nourishing Pills or Qing E Pills, or grande tonic pills for yin deficiency or Rhizoma Dioscoreae Pills. Generally, all lower back pain arises from kidney deficiency. If accompanied by pathogenic factors, remove the pathogens first. For instance, mix sweet leaf, dried tangerine peel, and angelica in equal parts, take three qian, and consume with liquor. According to &quot;Rules,&quot; use roasted black and white zhuo, three qian each, slightly roasted dog spine, three qian of rhizoma dioscoreae, two qian of myrrh, and five walnut meats, prepare into a paste. In severe cases, add five roasted large beans, take five to seven times. Afterward, use Kidney Decoction or unparalleled yam pills, which first purge and then tonify.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p>For those who suffer from fatigue and hard labor, nourishment is needed to benefit the limbs and joints. Use a formula of Four Substances combined with Angelica, Qianghuo, Du Zhong, and Niu Xi, with a small amount of cinnamon as a guide. If there&#39;s heat, add Zhimu; in severe cases, use the Ten Supplements Decoction or swallow Qing’e Pills.</p>

<p>Wind injures the kidneys, causing pain, and the pulse will show a floating quality. In &quot;Three Causes Prescription,&quot; use three taels of Du Zhong, stir-fried, and decocted with wine for consumption. Niu Xi taken with wine treats wind toxins attacking the kidney, causing stabbing pain. If affected by wind, cold, or dampness resulting in pain, it is advisable to use Wujisan with adjustments, with Qianghuo as the main herb. </p>
<p>For severe lower back pain, do not use invigorating herb or cold medications. Initially, warmth and dispersing medications must be added to harmonize the blood and quicken the qi; later, kidney tonics including the Four Substances, Niu, and Du Zhong should be added. Those who labor excessively must be replenished.

<p>When there is stagnation of qi and pain, the pulse must be deep and string-like or hidden. For those with a robust constitution, at the onset, it is suitable to use fragrant wood to disperse qi and nourish blood over time.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Six Principles of the Right Record&quot; states: Pain in the lower back is due to the influence of the sun. It also says: The Great Yang is the sun; when deficient, it causes pain in the lower back, head, and neck. When there is illness in the kidneys and liver, there will be stagnation and pain in the lower back. The scriptures say: The lower back is the organ of the kidneys; when it cannot move freely, the kidneys will be weary. All meridians connect to the kidneys and are linked to the lower back and spine. When kidney qi is deficient, pathogenic qi can easily invade, whether it be wind, cold, heat, or dampness. Alternatively, if blood coagulates and qi stagnates, it leads to obstruction and heaviness, causing the small intestine to be unable to transmit, resulting in symptoms. The &quot;Suwen&quot; discusses pain in the lower back stating that it divides into six meridian illnesses. For instance, pain in the lower back associated with the sun manifests with the neck, back, and buttocks feeling heavy. Pain in the lower back linked to the Yangming does not permit looking back; if one looks back, it seems as though something is seen, leading to sadness. Pain in the lower back associated with the Shaoyang feels like being pricked with needles, and it is difficult to bend or stretch. The pulse is dispersed, causing back pain and heat, which can lead to restlessness, with the lower back feeling as if there is a horizontal wood within it, and severe cases may result in involuntary urination. Pain in the lower back linked to the Shaoyin pulls into the spine and the sides.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pain in the lower back of the Jueyin, feels like a bowstring being drawn tight. It is characterized by a sense of unease and lack of understanding. The channel addressed is the separate channel of the foot Taiyang, which causes lower back pain radiating to the shoulders, often accompanied by a feeling of urgency to urinate. Moreover, the pain is similar to a pulling sensation, akin to bending the waist, and is often accompanied by fear. </p>
<p>The channel corresponding to Yin also pertains to the separate connection of the foot Shaoyang, which induces lower back pain that feels like a small hammer lodged within, causing swelling. The Yangwei channel, being a unique branch of the Taiyang, results in lower back pain with swelling above. The Hengluo channel, being a connection outside of the Taiyang, leads to pain in the lower back that makes bending forward or backward unbearable; any attempt to lift heavy objects aggravates the injury, and should this connection be severed, bad blood returns to it. </p>
<p>The Huiyin channel, the central meridian of the foot Taiyang, causes lower back pain that is accompanied by copious sweating; when the sweat dries, it induces a thirst that makes one feel the urge to flee. The Feiyang channel corresponds to the Yinwei channel, resulting in lower back pain that feels heavy and burdensome, leading to extreme sadness and fear. The Changyang channel, which corresponds to the Yinqiao channel, causes lower back pain that radiates to the chest, and intense discomfort may lead to a rolling back of the tongue, rendering one unable to speak.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse in the flesh is born from the Shao Yang, hence it is the pulse of the Yang Wei that manifests. This causes waist pain; one cannot cough, for coughing induces a tightening of the tendons, causing pain that radiates to the spine, reaching the head and causing a sensation of being stiff and collapsing, leading to a desire to faint. It is advised to needle the foot Tai Yang.</p>
<p>For waist pain, if there is cold above, needle the foot Tai Yang and Yang Ming. If there is heat above, needle the foot Jue Yin. One cannot bend or look up, so needle the foot Shao Yang. If there is internal heat and shortness of breath, needle the foot Shao Yin. If there is fullness in the lower abdomen, needle the foot Jue Yin. Waist pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and cannot be faced upwards should be treated by needling both ankles above.</p>
<p>The section regarding heat states: for those suffering from spleen heat disease, the heat struggles cause waist pain inhibiting bending and fullness in the abdomen leading to diarrhea. For kidney heat disease, pain first occurs in the waist and thighs, accompanied by thirst. </p>
<p>Moreover, the waist is a major joint of the body, associated with the six channels and their supporting vessels, which are often deficient and sometimes excessive. This condition may result from excessive sexual activity or attacks from the four qi, causing deficiency and allowing pathogens to contend, resulting in pain. </p>
<p>According to the writings of the Chao family and the &quot;Qian Jin Fang,&quot; there are five theories regarding waist pain, each with different causes: First, insufficient Yang qi, leading to Shao Yin kidney weakness, hence waist pain. Second, wind-dampness causing pain in the waist.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The third point is kidney deficiency, which causes pain due to overwork harming the kidneys. The fourth point is kidney and lumbar injuries, which cause pain due to injuries to the lower back. The fifth point is sleeping on damp ground, which also leads to pain. This discusses the causes of illness. Chen Wuze further divides it into three causes. Generally, the Taiyang and Shaoyin are often afflicted by cold, while the Shaoyang and Jueyin are more prone to wind; the Yangming and Taiyin are often impacted by dryness and dampness. Thus, lower back pain related to these six meridians is due to external factors. If there is a loss of ambition, it injures the kidneys; excessive anger harms the liver; worry and contemplation harm the spleen. In such cases, lower back pain arises from internal factors. Generally speaking, this condition is never not caused by kidney deficiency. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; foot meridians—three Yin, three Yang, and twelve channels including the eight vessels—are connected to the kidneys and lower back pain. Each channel has specific acupuncture methods for treatment; or if wind, cold, dampness, and heat accumulate, combined with loss of ambition, excessive sexual activity, injuries, sprains, stagnation of Qi and blood resulting in pain, one should investigate the five types of three causes. Ultimately, treatment should be based on the source, using methods of sweating, purging, tonifying, or draining for therapy. If the pulse is floating and wiry, it indicates wind; if it is wiry and tight, it points to cold; if it is deep and thin, it signifies dampness; if it is deep and solid, it denotes heat; and if it is deep and slippery, it indicates Qi or blood stagnation. Understanding the illness in relation to the six meridians and five categories of three causes allows for a clear diagnosis, and the use of medicine will yield comprehensive efficacy.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: The waist is an organ of the kidneys, governing water and fire, and it is the root of life. If well adjusted, the foundation is solid and the leaves flourish; if poorly adjusted, the roots wither and the leaves droop. After examining four major prescriptions for treating the waist, it is clear.</p>
<p>For waist pain due to kidney deficiency, Qing&#39;e is combined with Huangbo and Zhimowan for treatment. The kidneys represent the Kan (water) element; illnesses stem from water and fire. If water declines, yang energy alone governs, leading to heat in the kidneys; if fire declines, yin energy attacks, causing cold in the kidneys. When both water and fire decline, the earth energy dominates, allowing pathogens to enter the kidneys, resulting in waist pain. This formula includes materials like old paper, Duzhong, and walnuts, which are rich and warming; Huangbo, Zhimou, and Niuxi, which are rich and cooling. Warming substances can nourish yang, while cooling substances can nourish yin, balancing them allows the mixture to reach the lower body. If Bihai is used, it is a bitter and drying substance that effectively disperses pathogenic water and earth, stabilizing its energy. Qing&#39;e represents the Kan element that nurtures yang. Therefore, by naming the formula, the essence of balancing water and fire is made clear.</p>
<p>For weak kidney qi with liver and spleen qi attacking, resulting in pain and discomfort in the waist and knees, along with coldness and weakness, the treatment is Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang. The kidneys are the water organs; if they are deficient, liver and spleen qi gather, making the waist and knees feel heavy and painful. If there is difficulty in bending and stretching, it indicates illness in both muscles and bones. The &quot;Lingshu Jing&quot; states: if one can bend but not stretch, the issue is with the muscles; if one can stretch but not bend, the issue is with the bones. Therefore, we understand that difficulty in bending and stretching signifies illness in both muscles and bones. If there is cold obstruction, it is due to excess of yin pathogen; lack of strength indicates deficiency in qi and blood.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The following herbs—Duhuo, Jisheng, Xixin, Qinjiao, Fangfeng, and Gui Xin—are warming in nature and can elevate the energy of the liver and spleen. When the liver and spleen energy rises, the waist and knees will not ache. Angelica, cooked Rehmannia, Bai Shao, Chuan Xiong, Du Zhong, and Niu Xi are nourishing herbs that can replenish the yin of the liver and kidneys. When the yin of the liver and kidneys is replenished, the feet will have enough blood to walk. Ginseng, Fuling, and Licorice are herbs that benefit qi; they can nourish the yang of all organs. When the yang of all organs is strengthened, the cold and numbness will have power.</p>
<p>When the kidneys are affected by dampness, the waist feels cold like ice; if there is something amiss, Jingguo Decoction is the remedy. The kidneys govern water, while the spleen controls dampness. When dampness prevails, it flows and must return to the water region, hence the term “kidney dampness.” The waist is associated with the kidneys, and dampness is a yin-like energy, hence the waist feels cold like ice.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is something, it indeed adheres to that. Dried ginger is a hot and spicy substance; its spiciness derives from the dryness of metal, while its heat comes from the directive of fire. Dryness can overcome dampness, and sunlight can expose dampness, which is why it is symbolized and applied. White atractylodes and licorice are sweet and warm products; their sweetness derives from the flavor of earth, and warmth comes from the energy of earth. Earth is strong and can control dampness, so they are used to assist. White Poria is a sweet and bland product; its sweetness enhances the earth to guard against water, and its blandness opens the orifices to aid, which is essential in strategizing. </p>
<p>For mild lower back pain, use pig&#39;s kidneys, Qingyan (blue salt), and eucommia bark as main ingredients. The Book of Changes states: &quot;Similar things gather together, and objects divide into groups.&quot; Thus, pig&#39;s kidneys can nourish the lower back. The classics say: &quot;Among the five flavors, salt first enters the kidneys,&quot; which is why Qingyan can address the lower regions. Eucommia bark is a spicy and sweet substance that benefits the kidneys.

<p>Lumbar pain is traditionally classified into five types: First, deficiency of Yang, indicating Kidney decline; second, pain due to wind-dampness or cold; third, injury to the kidneys from overwork; fourth, damage from falling or heavy impacts; and fifth, pain from sleeping on damp ground. Although this classification is generally accurate, it does not capture all aspects. This condition has variations in terms of exterior and interior, deficiency and excess, cold and heat. Understanding these six categories can provide a comprehensive overview, and treatment is not difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, continuous and recurring lumbar pain indicates kidney deficiency; pain that worsens in rainy conditions or after prolonged sitting suggests dampness; pain associated with cold and a preference for warmth indicates a cold condition; pain exacerbated by heat, with a preference for cold, suggests heat; pain due to frustration or anger indicates stagnation of Qi; pain accompanying worries or mental strain suggests Qi deficiency; and pain arising from exertion suggests Qi exhaustion. It is essential to identify the causes and treat accordingly.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The waist is the residence of the kidneys, and the kidneys and bladder are interconnected. Thus, in terms of meridians, it belongs to the Yang aspect; in terms of organs, it is related to kidney qi, which is also a crucial junction for the Chong, Ren, Du, and Dai meridians. Therefore, most cases of腰痛 (lower back pain) are due to deficiency of the true yin, and the main focus should be on nourishing kidney qi. Of those who have true pathogenic factors causing腰痛, it is merely two or three out of ten. </p>
<p>In cases of腰痛 with deficiency, it is nine out of ten. One should observe that there is neither exterior pathogen nor damp-heat, and it may be caused by aging, overexertion, indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures, or mental distress resulting from emotional turmoil, all of which belong to true yin deficiency. </p>
<p>For all deficiency signs, the complexion must be clear, though it may also appear dark; the pulse should be soft and gentle, but it can be subtle. Whether due to inability to stand or walk (which may lead to less rest while lying down) or due to fatigue and weakness that worsens with labor, all such gradual accumulations indicate deficiency; while those that arise suddenly and cause intense pain generally indicate excess. Internal injuries due to constitution are largely insufficient, while externally contracted pathogens are typically in excess. Therefore, the practitioner must discern the underlying causes.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>When there is a deficiency of the kidney&#39;s true yin, leading to a decrease in essence and blood that causes pain, it is best to use Danggui Dihuang Decoction along with Zuo Gui Wan and You Gui Wan. If the condition is slightly lighter, or if the pain and deficiency are not severe, alternatives like Qing&#39;e Wan, Wei Shen San, Bu Sui Dan, Er Zhi Wan, and Tongqi San may be chosen. </p>
<p>For superficial symptoms of lower back pain, any external factors like wind, cold, and dampness that obstruct the meridians affecting the Taiyang and Shayyin channels should be considered. If wind and cold are present in the meridians, the symptoms will likely include alternating chills and fever, a tight and rapid pulse, sudden onset, and pain that is constricting, sour, and radiates up to the spine. It is essential to differentiate between yin and yang, and treatment should aim to disperse. </p>
<p>For yang conditions with predominant heat, it is advisable to use a decoction of Chai Hu or the standard Chai Hu Decoction. For yin conditions with predominant cold, the Two Chai Hu Decoction or Wujisan may be administered.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are still matters to address regarding treatments for cold damage. If dampness lingers in the channels resulting in腰痛, it may be due to rain, wet clothing, or sitting/lying on damp ground. Any external dampness entering the body is generally a surface condition, and it is advisable to take formulas like Jin Zheng Qi San or Ping Wei San. If dampness accompanies deficiency, Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang is recommended. If the dampness causes腰痛 and difficulty in urination, Wei Ling Tang or Wu Ling San with Cang Zhu should be administered. If wind-dampness is concurrent, resulting in body pain, Qiang Huo Sheng Shi Tang is suitable. If dampness is combined with heat, formulas such as Dang Gui Nian Tong Tang or Cang Zhu Tang should be used. If dampness is combined with cold, Ji Sheng Zhu Fu Tang or Wu Ji San may be appropriate. Generally,腰痛 has both cold and heat presentations; each presentation has two variations.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is external cold affecting the body, treatment should focus on warming and dispelling it as mentioned before, or one can also use hot objects to apply heat. If the cold is due to internal damage and yang deficiency, then treatment should aim at warming and tonifying as previously stated. There are two types of heat: if there is a deficiency of liver and kidney yin with depletion of fluids and excess fire, the treatment should nourish yin and reduce fire, using the Eight Flavor Decoction or adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Huangqin, and Zhizi to the Four Substance Decoction. If there is pathogenic fire accumulating in the lower back and kidneys, with no inherent deficiency, it will definitely cause severe pain and restlessness, possibly leading to extreme thirst and urinary issues. In this case, one must directly combat the fire with a significant dosage of Qingyin Decoction adjusted as needed.</p>
<p>For injuries causing lower back pain due to falls or impacts, this injury resides in the muscles and bones, leading to stagnation of blood vessels. It is advisable to use the Four Substance Decoction with additions of Tao Ren, Hong Hua, Niu Xi, Rou Gui, Yan Hu Suo, Ru Xiang, and Mo Yao.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<p>Danxi states: For all waist pains, one should not use ginseng to tonify Qi; tonifying Qi will only increase the pain. Neither should one use extreme coldness, as it can cause obstruction and intensify the pain. These statements are incorrect. In general, those with injuries from overexertion and insufficient Yang frequently exhibit signs of Qi deficiency; why should ginseng not be used? Moreover, if heat accumulates in the lower region, causing severe and unbearable pain, it is necessary to clear the heat promptly; why should cold be avoided? However, if there is a combination of deficiency and excess, there are cases where ginseng should not be used; even if there is heat present but it is not severe, excessive cold should also be avoided. If one asserts that it cannot be used in all cases, is this indeed true?</p>
<p>If a woman suffers from excessive harm to Yin due to fetal energy and menstrual issues, leading to significant waist pain and leg soreness, the Dang Gui and Di Huang Decoction should be used.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>When back pain prevents raising the feet, and sitting feels as though one may fall to the ground, the shins feel stiff, the Shen Mai governs this. </p>
<p>If the back pain feels like a small hammer inside, with swelling and pain that prevents coughing—coughing makes the muscles tense painfully, with varying sensations of hot and cold, the Yang Fu governs this. </p>
<p>With back pain that impedes raising the feet, pain in the back of the heel, or weakness in the legs, the Pu Shen governs this. </p>
<p>Finally, if back pain radiates to the head in a severe manner, accompanied by visual disturbances, the Wei Zhong governs this.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For every moxibustion, two fires are applied simultaneously. The moxa reaches the flesh, and initially, one feels pain. Two people then blow on either side until the fire is extinguished. When applied at noon, the individual has already settled; the internal organs react spontaneously, sometimes moving as if accompanied by thunder, leading to immediate recovery. This method is extraordinarily effective and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhenheng in &quot;Heart Techniques&quot; states: If the waist is bent and cannot be straightened, needle the Ren (Conception) point. </p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: According to the &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; for lumbar pain, needling the foot&#39;s Taiyang point relieves pain radiating to the neck, spine, and lower back. The three methods involve needling the valley to draw blood, two methods involve drawing blood from the foot&#39;s Taiyang point as well.</p>
<p>The Classic states: If the pathogen is in the kidneys, symptoms include abdominal distention, lumbar pain, difficulty with bowel movements, and pain in the shoulders, back, and neck, often accompanied by dizziness; treat the Yongquan (Gushing Spring) and Kunlun (Kunlun Mountains) points, and withdraw blood as necessary. This treatment draws blood from both the foot&#39;s Taiyang and Shaoyin channels. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is stated that the channel of the foot&#39;s Taiyang, when disturbed, can cause dizziness and headaches; hence, one should observe the balance of Taiyang, whether it is strong or deficient in heat or cold, to determine needling techniques for immediate adjustment.</p>
<p>For lumbar pain in the foot’s Shaoyin channel, needle along the inner side of the spine to draw blood from the foot&#39;s Shaoyin channel. The Classic notes that the branch of the foot&#39;s Shaoyin is called the &quot;Great Bell,&quot; located behind the ankle, circling near to the Taiyang. If there is deficiency, lumbar pain results, so treating the branch is necessary to nourish the foot&#39;s Shaoyin network.</p>
<p>For lumbar pain, needling shouldn&#39;t be done while bending or looking upwards; three methods from the Shaoyang and Yangming channels all involve bloodletting.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classic text states: The liver foot jueyin meridian, when it moves, causes pain in the lower back, making it impossible to bend or look up. This should be treated by assessing the conditions of deficiency or excess, cold or heat, and applying tonification or sedation techniques, along with moxibustion for regulation. To treat pain in the lower back radiating to the lower abdomen (the lesser moon), one cannot look up; the needling is applied at the waist-hindquarters junction, with three references in the classic texts, of which this is one. The Treatise on Acupuncture states: Pain in the lower back radiating to the lower abdomen (the lesser moon) makes it impossible to lie back. Needling the solution at the waist-hindquarters, above the two tendons, is known as the lumbar shu point, using the cyclical rhythm of the moon to guide the treatment, alternating needling left and right. Furthermore, the Treatise on Bone Cavities states: Pain in the lower back prevents turning or shaking, quickly affecting the lower yin; needling the eight sacral points along with the area of pain, located at the waist-hindquarters junction. These three sections of classic texts have largely similar meanings and share a unified method. Additionally, the liver foot jueyin meridian, upon movement, causes lower back pain, making it impossible to bend or look up. The conditions of excess or deficiency and heat or cold can be assessed for treatment; hence while the symptoms are the same, the treatment methods differ.</p>
<p>For treating lower back pain, there are three main approaches: one is related to the yangming channel; if pain radiates to the shoulder with urinary issues, needling the solution point is done at the muscular and tendon junction outside the xie; if pain radiates to the nape and spine with stiffness or risk of collapsing, needling the foot taiyang at the yong point is indicated. For lower back pain, the section discusses six methods at the foot taiyang channel point in the middle of the popliteal area. The popliteal area is at the back of the knee, situated between the two tendons, horizontally within the popliteal cavity.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: For back pain guidance, sit facing east, collect the hands to embrace the heart. One person holds both knees in the front, and another supports the head from behind. Gradually pull to lie down, with the head touching the ground, rise and lie down three times, repeat this for a long time to be effective. The &quot;Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states: When qi and blood are weak, it is related to the kidneys; various cold factors draw in, all belong to weakness of kidney water qi, which may lead to back pain. In winter, when water is abundant, it is advisable to practice breathing techniques and regulate the flow of air. Avoid cold and favor going to bed early. Generally, in winter, the energy is retracted and closed, reaching extreme cold; one should regulate desires to nourish the initial growth of yang. For yin and yang to unite, the essence must harmonize; all things are subtly grounded and should not be shaken. If you maintain this, you will preserve your longevity without bounds. Back pain guidance: let the fire of the kidney bring warmth, or rub the heated palms on the painful area. For lumbar wind soft guidance: raise the fire in the kidneys to warm the back, then transfer this heat down to the kidneys.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Records of the Historian&quot; in the biography of Cang Gong states: The brother of King Huang Ji of Qi, Huang Changqing, hosted a banquet for guests, as was the custom. While the guests were seated but had not yet begun to eat, I noticed the younger brother of the queen, Song Jian, and informed him: &quot;You have been ill for four to five days, experiencing pain in your lower back and flanks. You cannot bend or stretch, nor can you urinate. If not treated urgently, this condition will affect your kidneys, compromising your five vital organs. Immediate care is essential. The illness you currently have is an obstruction in the kidneys, which is known as kidney wind.&quot; Song Jian acknowledged this. He had indeed suffered from back pain for four to five days; due to the rainy weather, the people of the Huang family were playing with stones near his house, and he too desired to emulate them, but he was unable to rise after attempting. By evening, his back pain worsened, and he could not urinate; he remains unwell to this day. </p>
<p>For his condition, I conclude that he must maintain a careful demeanor. Therefore, I observed his symptoms and noted that his complexion had a dry, sunken hue, and that the area above his kidneys and below his waist appeared withered. This indicates that I recognized his onset four to five days earlier. I prescribed a gentle decoction for him, and after eighteen days, he recovered.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the maidservant of the King of Jibei, Han, who suffered from back pain coupled with cold and heat symptoms, many doctors diagnosed it as a cold-heat condition. However, upon feeling her pulse, I observed internal cold, which correlates with her menstruation being absent. I adjusted her medication swiftly, and her condition improved immediately. The reason for her illness was a desire for a male child that was unfulfilled. Therefore, while diagnosing Han’s illness, I noted that when feeling her pulse, I checked her kidney pulse, which was weak and not connected, indicating difficulty with her condition, hence her menstruation was not coming. The liver pulse, detected at the left inch, indicated her desire for a male child that could not be obtained.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Rituals of the Confucian School&quot; states: A servant girl of Dai, while traveling in winter, arrived with her face red as fire. Upon reaching (Shuiyin), she suffered severe pain in her waist and experienced urgency with a heavy sensation in her lower abdomen, and when the pain occurred, she claimed to see spirits. Dai, the physician, said: This pertains to the Shaoyang channel; the fire is located at the side of the body. He prescribed medicinal pills and decoction to harmonize the channels, and after several purgative treatments, the illness had not yet healed. People were puzzled and thought she was possessed. Dai, in anger, exclaimed: It’s a donkey spirit! He then adjusted the gastrointestinal harmonizing decoction and combined it with one measure of the powdered root of the Qian Niu Tou, cooking and administering it. The treatment induced a plentiful cramping, about one or two bowls in total, and then she cast aside her cane, only feeling thirst. Dai allowed her to drink as much water as she wanted, along with watermelon, pears, and persimmons, saying: In treating fire, nothing compares to ice. Water is the ultimate form of yin from heaven and earth. After drinking one or two buckets, she still felt slight pain. Dai then needled her Yanglingquan point to relieve the stagnation, which is the point on the foot corresponding to the Shaoyang gallbladder channel. From this treatment onward, she felt at ease. The maidservant then mentioned: Every year, I must purge five or six times; this year I haven&#39;t purged, which is why I feel this way.常仲, understanding her words keenly, realized that due to her damp illness, he also must purge more than ten times a year, thus the onset of his ailment. This can be discussed with the wise, but is difficult to explain to the foolish.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

Some treat it as a case of cold dampness affecting the feet, while others see it as a deficiency. Various invigorating and blood-stimulating medicines, including black, aconite, motherwort, and myrrh, were used extensively. After over sixty days, the symptoms persisted: red eyes, internal heat, and troubled urination, while the back and hips remained the same. A physician examined the patient&#39;s pulse and found both wrists to be deep and slow, indicating an internal issue that required purging. Administered were doses of Zhou Che Wan and Jun Chuan San, eliminating over twenty blocks of stagnant water. After a morning meal of thin rice porridge and some horse, the patient regained significant vitality.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over sixty years old suffered from pain in his lower back, hips, and spine, which had persisted for several years without relief. He experienced quiet during the day but restless nights, with severe pain coming and going, leading him to repeatedly seek to end his life. His pain intensified in the evening, requiring others to strike him with a pestle, but it would gradually reduce by the time the rooster crowed at dawn, and cease by morning. Those around him, as well as the patient himself, believed that spirits and supernatural beings were punishing him with the bite of a white tiger. They prayed fervently day and night, causing shamans, monks, and practitioners of various religious disciplines to come, which seemed to alleviate his pain. He also dreamed of battles among spirits, and offered sacrifices to every mountain, river, and shrine without exception. As time passed, he became emaciated and dehydrated, his appetite diminished, and his anger grew, as he awaited death.</p>
<p>A scholar suggested that since the trouble stemmed from the spirits and the biting of the tiger, despite their prayers, there had been no response. He heard of a man named Zhang Dai from Chen County, skilled in medicine, and suggested consulting him about his affliction from the white tiger and the spirits. If he lacked a solution, he could entrust his fate. The man’s family followed this advice. Zhang Dai examined his pulse, which was heavy, stagnant, and rigid, with a strength similar to that of a stretched bow. He informed them: despite the man&#39;s emaciation and difficulty in eating, the pain in his lower back, hips, and spine indicated that his bowel movements were likely hard and dry.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>His attendants said: &quot;After five to seven days, or even eight to nine days, we saw small hard lumps of dry feces, like pellets, which were so hardened that they could not be described. We had someone fetch them, and after forcibly taking out one or two lumps, the patient experienced dryness and itching all over, with the skin peeling and becoming as dehydrated as dried dough. Once we understood the patient&#39;s condition, we used a major purgative decoction boiled with ginger and jujube and added two qian of the powdered root of the qian niu tou (milk vetch). We dared not call it a purgative. It was because the patient found warmth pleasurable and feared the cold; when we said it would be nourishing, he accepted it, but when we mentioned purging, he resisted. Such a condition does not develop overnight, especially when surrounded by those who supported him, and the people of Chu encouraged him. After boiling the mixture, we allowed him to swallow it slightly warm, starting with small amounts and gradually increasing over three days. By the evening of that third day, the organs had expelled four to five liters, about half a basin. Upon inspection by lantern light, the liquid consisted entirely of dry feces, hard masses, and stagnant blood—filthy and unapproachable. In a short while, the pain reduced by nine-tenths, and he fell into a deep sleep, breathing regularly like a normal person. By the next day towards evening, he felt hungry and asked for porridge, which we gave him warm. After one or two more days of rest, all his pain had entirely healed. Next, we advised him to adjust his diet for nourishment and to take the dao shui wan (water guiding pills) and gan lu san (sweet dew powder), medicines that promoted smooth urination and defecation. It took more than forty days for him to fully recover. Once the illness was cured, he lived to be eighty years old. Therefore, all dry conditions are considered illnesses of the three yang.&quot;<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The northern man, Wei Dexin, encountered a diagnosis of illness at Xijiang during the winter months, suffering from coldness and persistent back pain, unable to bend or stretch. His legs felt heavy, making it difficult to walk, so he was carried on a bed along the way. Upon consulting doctors, they all stated it was due to kidney deficiency, recommending the use of herbs like cistanche, bark of the Baijiguo, aconite, and deer antler. However, he experienced constipation and tidal fever for almost a year, so he sought help from Doctor Dai. Doctor Dai remarked that this illness would show improvement in ten days, to which Wei replied that a month would not be too late. </p>
<p>Doctor Dai explained that when the kidney&#39;s energy in the foot yang meridian is excessive, it can lead to back pain as if it were broken, causing stiffness in the knees and discomfort in the lower back. The cold from the yang meridian obstructed the body, making bending and stretching difficult. Moreover, the lower back is the house of the kidneys and a vital joint in the body. Given its rigidity and hindrance, it should be softened. When taken suddenly, the body would become harmonious and flexible. </p>
<p>The Nan Jing states: If one engages in strong physical activity, the kidneys can be harmed, and marrow may dry up, leading to damage to the bones, which is similar to this case. In Wei&#39;s condition, the yang meridian was obstructed by cold, causing stagnation of blood in the lower back. This was not merely kidney deficiency. </p>
<p>Following a regimen with medication over several hundred dosages, roughly one or two bean measures of blood were drawn. After that, he was treated with steaming from a special stove, resulting in sweating three to five times which led to recovery. Initially, after five days of steaming, Doctor Dai inquired if there was any sound from the stomach. Wei replied no, but by the sixth day, he felt it gurgling, and by the seventh day, he was able to greet others respectfully. Doctor Dai cautioned that those with heat should avoid steaming, as it could harm the eyes.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

It was also said: if the surface feels like hemp and the interior feels like melon, the abscess is toxic inside. Upon re-examining the next day, the pulse was weak. I remarked that if the sore had not yet ruptured while the pulse was already weak, how could one expect to contain it? Moreover, with constipation, the vital energy was already depleted, making treatment futile. His son insisted, and with no other choice, I prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Huo Xiang and Shen Qu, slowly advancing diet, and the bowel movement eventually began. Further, a strong tonic was used; when it ruptured, the pus was clear, and upon feeling thirsty, additional herbs—ginseng, astragalus, angelica, cooked rehmannia, ophiopogon, and schisandra—were used to stop the thirst. Yuncheng happily said, &quot;My mother should be fine now.&quot; I disagreed, stating that it could not be contained, echoing the words of my predecessors. He was doubtful and soon sought other doctors, ultimately to no avail.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman from the Lu family, upon her first marriage, suffered from lower back pain without swelling, her pulse was deep and slippery, and she felt fatigued. This was caused by the internal onset of the seven emotions&#39; fire and the toxins from food. A decoction of herbal medicine was given, resulting in a discharge of pus. Chen Liangfu noted that if lesions had not yet ruptured but were inwardly festering, with a pale face and dark lips, they were untreatable. In fact, she passed away.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanzhong from Kunshan, who was a scholar, suffered from a back sore in late summer; the sore was the size of a large bean, with a root about three inches long, slightly swollen and reddish, exhibiting all signs of deficiency. Moxa was applied to the painful area using mulberry branches, and he took a dose of Lifesaving Decoction, which reduced the swelling and redness, although his appetite remained poor. Then he was given a restorative herbal formula of Xiangsha Liu Junzi Tang in four doses, gradually increasing his food intake. Later, he used a highly nourishing medicine. Although pus formed, it did not rupture. He added one slice of Aconite to each dose of the nourishing medicine, and eventually, the pus flowed out on its own, leading to recovery in ten days.</p>
<p>A woman, suddenly enraged, developed a swelling on her lower back, with chest distress, experiencing occasional pain as qi surged.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered a small lesion on her waist, flesh-colored as usual, without ulceration or heat. I advised that it should be treated with tonifying qi and nourishing the body, along with herbs to relieve depression. Her family did not believe this and instead took a remedy for wind. Later, it ruptured and discharged pus, and she passed away after a year.</p>
<p>A man, nineteen years old, had a lump on his waist that was headless and painless, with no change in color, and it did not ulcerate for three months. He had little appetite and was losing weight. This was due to cold obstructing the pores, causing the qi to stagnate and leading to swelling, which was termed damp toxin. The &quot;Yuanrong&quot; text states that when a person has poor appetite, weakened essence, and diminished qi and blood, with wasted muscles and obstructed protective qi, the cold blocks the pores, causing stagnation that results in abscesses and swelling. Such cases should be treated by supplementing the weak qi. Thus, I prescribed Shen Qi Wan with additional Xiang Fu and Chen Pi for over thirty doses. I then applied acupuncture, which led to the discharge of about two bowls of white pus. The previous herbs were adjusted with doubled quantities of Ren Shen and Huang Qi, and moxibustion with Dou Chi cake was used, leading to gradual recovery. However, the patient was misguided by those seeking rapid results and took a poison-expelling remedy internally and applied cooling herbs externally, which worsened his condition, leading to reduced appetite and thin pus, with the affected area turning purple. He returned for further treatment. Delighted that his spirit had not been lost, I used the previous formula, adding Yuan Zhi, Bei Mu, and Bai Lian, and after a hundred doses, he recovered. If such a sore does not heal for a long time or if the pus is clear and thin, it should be treated with an internal obstructive dispersing remedy and moxibustion with Fu Zi cake, then recovery is possible. However, if one does not carefully manage diet, daily activities, and emotions, it cannot be treated.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

He should tonify qi and blood, unblock the stagnation, and apply a poultice of dried ginger to promote the free flow of qi and blood, so that the internal issue could disperse; even if it did not disappear, it would pose no danger.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from a toxic affliction in his waist, with pus that had ripened but not broken. After being needled, the pus discharged greatly, but he became increasingly restless. Four doses of Shengyu decoction calmed him, and further doses of Ren Shen Yang Rong decoction, combined with Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi over two months, brought about healing. Later, he suffered from dampness, which became a chronic ailment. Whenever pus, blood, and other discharges are copious, and the wound is slow to close, it is especially important to replenish and nurture, ensuring that qi and blood recover. Otherwise, he may develop other conditions that will be difficult to treat; caution is advised!</p>
<p>Another man experienced toxins in his waist that manifested but did not break, with qi and blood being stagnated without the ability to turn into pus. After a few doses of potent tonics, the area finally erupted. Following several more doses, the pus remained clear. He then consumed a mixture of Ren, Qi, and Gui Zhi preparations, resulting in less viscous pus. Gradually, the pus became thicker, and muscle tissue began to form. In cases of large boils and abscesses, the condition primarily relies on qi. If an affliction arises without eruption or if it ruptures without rotting or fails to congeal—with pus being minimal or clear—it indicates a deficiency in qi and blood. Therefore, it warrants significant tonification while strictly avoiding aggressive medications. There are cases where pus reverts to being copious, indicating that the deficiency in qi and blood prevents control. If, after rupture, one experiences fever and thirst with a strong pulse and increasing pus, it pertains to genuine qi deficiency with excess pathogenic influence and will not heal effectively. </p>
<p>It is common to see robust individuals with conditions that lead to swollen, red lesions which easily rot and have viscous pus, making them easier to congeal. In contrast, weaker people often do not erupt, rot, or close easily. Should one recklessly administer aggressive treatments without careful examination, the risk of collapse and other complications becomes inevitable. After suffering from such conditions, one must focus on recovery, especially in cases resembling nodular or exudative ailments, where nourishment is particularly critical. Otherwise, one may develop additional complications that will be difficult to treat; caution is advised!<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The official Zhang Biyai suffered from a carbuncle at his waist. He entered the room inebriated, with a pulse that was rapid and strong, and the pain intensified. I advised against treatment. As he was about to board a boat, his son insisted he stay, and shortly thereafter he vomited foul-smelling blood, five or six bowls&#39; worth. I suspected that this was due to deficiency in the kidney channel leading to chaotic blood flow; the blood would inevitably escape through the gaps between his teeth. I decided to use herbs such as cinnamon to tonify the kidneys and restrain the fire, preparing them for use. Once the bleeding stopped, I wiped his teeth and confirmed my suspicion. I then gave him a dose of cold medicine, which immediately alleviated his thirst. After a while, I administered a dose of warm medicine; his pulse became weak and his breathing shallow. After receiving the medicine, his pulse improved slightly but eventually became weak again. His son, suspecting there might be pus inside, wanted to puncture it. I said there was surely none. In the end, with a goose feather, it was confirmed to be just as I had predicted. The next day, his pulse was weak, his feet cold up to the knees, and his abdomen felt as if it were made of ice. I urgently applied a remedy of Six Gentleman Pills with ginger and Aconite, which warmed the abdomen and led to the beginning of pus discharge, with the sore seemingly healing. Since the attendants all loved his concubine, he also suffered from urinary obstruction; his yin was weak and sought release of essence, but the essence within had deteriorated and could not escape. I administered a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill, adding ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes. Although his urination improved, the wound did not close and he eventually perished.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

Due to carelessness in his daily activities, the wound festered, became about a foot in size, dark in color, and emitted a foul smell. His urination resembled dribbling, his lips cracked, and his tongue felt prickly. By the end of July, his left wrist pulse was rapid and strong, and the pulse at his left guan position was superficial and weak. I believed that the initial thirst followed by the sore indicated that the kidney&#39;s water had dried up, resulting in deficient fire rising upward, making recovery unlikely. The pus was foul-smelling, dark in color, and painless, with the wound wide open, indicating that the spleen&#39;s energy had deteriorated and kidney water was exhausted. The rapid and strong left wrist pulse signified the kidney&#39;s inability to produce anything. The weak and superficial left guan pulse indicated lung overacting on the liver. Furthermore, during this time of metal flourishing, the situation was perilous. Two days later, he indeed passed away.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Gate Law&quot; states: Zhang Ling&#39;s younger brother suffered from typhoid fever leading to severe symptoms, weakening both loins, causing him to lie in bed crying out in pain throughout the night. After many treatments failed, he sought a diagnosis from me. His pulse was steady and showed no signs of illness, yet his pain had significantly decreased compared to before. I said, &quot;This illness is not fatal, but I fear he may become incapacitated.&quot; The key to this condition lies in the pain that feels like a stabbing, indicating a struggle between the pathogenic and vital forces. If there were no pain at all, the pathogenic and vital forces would merge into one, coexisting without issue. Now that the pain perception has greatly diminished, it is indeed concerning and requires prompt treatment. The patient responded, &quot;Since my body is already weakened, it would be better to die quickly.&quot; I furrowed my brow, wanting to save him but lacking a treatment method. After contemplating for a long time, I concluded that the pathogen had deeply penetrated both loins, causing blood vessels to close off for a long time and preventing proper circulation. The only method left was to disperse it. However, since the pathogen had been present for so long and the vital energy was completely exhausted, any aggressive treatment would likely be ineffective. Thus, I prescribed a modified version of the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Decoction, adding a large dosage of cinnamon and aconite. After taking it, the patient was able to rise with strength. I then followed my earlier intention to form it into pills, and after taking them for ten days, he was completely well. This was not a method already tested by previous practitioners, but rather a timely adaptation; however, it had been effective in the past. In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s treatment of chest blockage, there is a method using Aconite and Rhubarb, which originally combines these two ingredients. However, in cases with excess energy above, this method is used to drain the heart. In contrast, for cases with excessive blood below, one cannot simply emulate its intention and combine peach kernel and cinnamon to disperse the blood stasis in the loins, can one? Later, Jiang Gusheng, Zhang&#39;s younger brother, suffered from typhoid fever with similar symptoms, and without overthinking, he directly applied this method, recovering after just two doses.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>
