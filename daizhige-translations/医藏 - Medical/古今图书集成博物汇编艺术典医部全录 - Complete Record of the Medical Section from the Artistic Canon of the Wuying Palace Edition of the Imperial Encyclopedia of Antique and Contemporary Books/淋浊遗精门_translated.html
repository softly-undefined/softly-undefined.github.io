<p><strong>Gate of Dripping and Turbid Semen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Treatise on the Six Yuan and Correct Principles</strong></p>
<p>The governing of Yangming from the heavens leads to the initial energies; when urination is yellow or red, it can result in dripping.<br>[Note: When the Yin condenses externally, the Yang is constrained internally, hence the people suffer from yellow urination and dripping-related symptoms.]</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Vital Energy Communication to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Yin is that which stores essence while arising urgently. Yang is that which defends the exterior and solidifies. External winds invade with excessive sexual energy, resulting in the loss of essence and harming the liver.<br>[Note: Wind is a Yang evil, invading the surface and thus injuring Qi. If the Yang energy is harmed, the cold Yin essence is released. The evil of wind and wood internally affects the liver, which governs the storage of blood; if the liver Qi is affected, it harmfully impacts the blood.]</p>
<p><strong>Lingshu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the Original Spirit</strong></p>
<p>Fear and anxiety that cannot be resolved will injure the essence. When the essence is harmed, bones will weaken and wither, and the essence tends to descend on its own. Therefore, the five organs, which govern the storage of essence, must not be harmed; if harmed, they will lose control and become Yin deficient. In a state of Yin deficiency, there is no Qi, and without Qi, there is death.<br>[Note: Fear injures the kidneys, thus unresolved fear harms the essence in the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones, hence when the essence is harmed, the bones weaken and wither. The essence tends to descend when the organ Qi is harmed and cannot store anymore. The spirit and energy are born from the essence, thus the essence of the five organs must not be harmed; harm leads to loss of control and Yin deficiency, and in Yin deficiency, the spirit is cut off and death ensues.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Jinguai Yaolüe</strong> (Golden Chamber Essentials) by Zhang Ji of Han</p>
<p><strong>Lin (Strangury)</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on the Five Zang states: When heat resides in the upper jiao (region), it causes cough leading to lung atrophy. If heat resides in the middle jiao, it results in hardness. If heat resides in the lower jiao, it causes urinary blood, also making the strangury difficult to pass. The chapter on Strangury states: The condition of strangury is such that the urine appears like grains of millet, with a tense lower abdomen and pain radiating to the navel. Those suffering from strangury should not induce sweating, as it will result in blood in the urine.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of Essence</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on Blood Stasis states: The condition due to overexertion manifests as a floating and large pulse, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet. Symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and improve in autumn and winter. Cold yin can lead to spontaneous loss of essence, with sourness and debilitation impeding circulation. In men, the pulse is floating, weak, and hesitant, indicating infertility with cool essence. For those suffering loss of essence, there are tense sensations in the lower abdomen, coldness in the lower Yin, dizziness, and hair loss. A very weak, hollow, and slow pulse indicates the absence of essence and blood. If the pulse is slightly floating but with a tight feeling, it indicates loss of essence in men and dreams of intercourse in women, which should be treated with Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Decoction. A pulse that is tense and large indicates reduction, while a large pulse suggests emptiness; reduction suggests coldness, while emptiness suggests deficiency. When deficiency and coldness combine, it is termed &quot;transformative disorder.&quot; For women, there may be excessive vaginal discharge, and for men, loss of blood and essence. Symptoms of deficiency from overexertion include urgency in the abdomen, palpitations, nasal bleeding, abdominal pain, dreams of loss of essence, soreness in the limbs, restlessness in the hands and feet, dryness in the throat and mouth; Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction is indicated for these symptoms.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>The Central Scriptures</strong> by Hua Tuo (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>On Difficulties in Passing Urine</strong></p>
<p>Those who experience difficulty in urination have issues with the five organs not functioning properly, the six bowels being imbalanced, the three jiao (burners) congested, and the nourishment and defense systems being depleted. Factors such as excessive heat in the stomach from drinking alcohol, becoming overly intoxicated during intimate acts, exhausting one&#39;s spirit, and damaging blood energy can contribute to this condition. Sometimes, it may be due to excitement leading to depleted essence, or indulgence causing the true fluids to be frequently lost. Additionally, anxiety and worry can disturb this process, improper timing with hunger or fullness can result in complications, and excessive movement or holding back urination can lead to issues. Cold may invade the bladder, prolonged outburst may cause retention, and heat in the bladder can injure one&#39;s balance, thereby resulting in this affliction.</p>
<p>The manifestations vary, leading to different names for the conditions, which can be classified into eight types: cold, heat, qi, labor, grease, sand, deficiency, and excess. Cold conditions manifest as frequent urination with clear, watery output. Heat conditions are characterized by dark, painful, and concentrated urine. Qi-related issues involve a sensation of fullness in the abdomen accompanied by painful and obstructed urination. Labor-related issues present as continuous dripping, resembling a leaking faucet. Grease-related problems involve urination that expels substances resembling greasy fat.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Sand refers to hidden pain in the lower abdomen and difficulty in urination. The pain is intolerable and feels like sand or stones in the urination, which may be as large as a jujube seed, and can be red or white with variable hues. This occurs due to weak kidney energy, excessive indulgence in lust, blockage without release, continuous overflow, which injures true energy and allows evil heat to accumulate, forming sand. It is similar to how water boils salt; with intense heat and little water, salt gradually turns into stone. The kidneys are associated with water; salty flavors return to the kidneys and accumulate there. When water is retained below and virtual heat intensifies, it cooks down to form sand, which is not a sudden condition. The distance from the fire leads to its development over five years; if it deteriorates, it happens in three years. For strong individuals, calamity may occur in five years, making urgent treatment necessary. Among the various types of painful urination, this one is the most critical. A pulse that is strong, large, and firm can be treated, while a weak, small, and thin pulse cannot. The weak condition implies that both the kidneys and the bladder are deficient, leading to involuntary leakage during dreams and inability to control urination. The strong condition indicates blocked channels, where water flow is hindered, resulting in pain in the loins and aching legs. Furthermore, diseases related to painful urination correspond to pulse characteristics; those aligned with pulse will live, while the contrary may die. The method of treatment also requires careful consideration.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Prescription [Jin Dynasty - Wang Shuhe]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sperm Emission and Dysuria Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The Kidney Pulse Song states: &quot;In the case of solid dysuria, it flows thickly; painful dysuria often appears. The pulse flows smoothly but is weak, frequently leaking essence, dreams often confused.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hollow Pulse Song states: &quot;Searching beneath the fingers, the pulse is weak; evil wind enters the small intestine. During illness, there is dripping and accompanying pain; making dumplings will surely resolve it.&quot; At the wrist, if the hollow pulse is weak at the kidney, small amounts of urine leak with blood coagulated and purulent.</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions [Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Urethral Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When heat accumulates in the middle burner, it becomes firm; when heat accumulates in the lower burner, it leads to blood in the urine, causing urethral obstruction. This often occurs in those with deficiencies taking large doses, provoked by heat in the lower burner. There can also be naturally occurring heat in the lower burner that is only slight but should be carefully monitored. </p>
<p>In all cases of qi dysuria, the symptoms involve difficulty urinating, often with residual dripping. In stone dysuria, there is pain in the stem and an inability to urinate completely. In glaucoma dysuria, the urine flows out like grease. In overwork dysuria, fatigue triggers the onset; pain radiates, driving qi downwards. In heat dysuria, heat triggers the onset, with severe cases resulting in blood in the urine. Treatment for all these conditions is similar to that of qi dysuria.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Six Writings of Hejian</strong><br><strong>[By Liu Wansuo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lin</strong></p>
<p>Lin refers to painful urination, which occurs due to heat invading the bladder, leading to blockage that prevents proper discharge. It is said that if urination is painful and does not flow, it is due to heat; if there is involuntary urination, it is due to cold. One must understand that severe heat invades the kidney area, becoming dry from the foot&#39;s jueyin channel, where the blockage is extreme, and thus the qi and blood cannot circulate. This leads to weakness and lack of function, causing fluids to seep into the bladder, resulting in loss of control over urination. </p>
<p>The classics say: the eye requires blood to see, the ear requires blood to hear, the hand requires blood to grasp, the palm requires blood to grip, the foot requires blood to walk, the organs require blood for fluids, and the bowels require blood for qi. Blood travels with qi; when qi and blood circulate smoothly, the spirit will become clear and its functions will be used. Furthermore, blood and qi are the spirit of a person and should be carefully nurtured. Therefore, all activities should be practiced regularly to ensure smooth circulation of qi and blood, allowing for functionality; if obstructed, the flow will be weak and the way will not be effective, hence leading to deterioration. If the illness is extremely heated, it will cause blockage, preventing the circulation of qi and blood, leading the spirit to lack functionality and inhibiting its natural processes, dependent on the severity of the blockage.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Therefore, when the eyes are obstructed, one cannot see colors; when the ears are obstructed, one cannot hear sounds; when the nose is obstructed, one cannot smell fragrances or odors; when the tongue is obstructed, one cannot discern flavors. As for muscle weakness and joint pain, when one cannot use their limbs, it is all caused by excessive heat and stagnation. Hence, Zhang Zhongjing explains in his discussion of lesser yin disease with extreme heat that symptoms such as urination and defecation loss, wild talk, and the eyes unable to see straight are first signs of kidney exhaustion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the kidneys govern the two yin. Therefore, when water is deficient and weak, and heat stagnates in that area, the two yin become blocked, leading to weakness, numbness, and the spirit having no use, which results in loss of urination and defecation that cannot be controlled. This proves heat is present. Thus, although ancient prescriptions say it is a case of cold heat, they only use cold medicines like elm bark, Huangqin, Qumai, Fuling, Tongcao, Jisuo, (wooded) plum seed, and Zhi Zi to treat it. Although the theory may seem irrational, the formula indeed has merit. Due to not understanding the mechanisms of qi&#39;s movement and changes, it is reasonable that some may recognize it as incorrect. Some suggest that patients with urethritis recover by taking caraway, Yizhi, talc, or warming alcohol, thinking this implies coldness. Little do they know that these are key medicines to promote urination. While the nature of warming alcohol and Yizhi is hot, caraway is warm, and talc is cold, these can dissipate stagnation, allowing qi and fluids to circulate, leading to heat dispersal and recovery.</p>
<p>Cloudy Urination</p>
<p>Cloudy urination: In hot weather, the water is turbid; in cold weather, it is clean. This is because clean water is clear while fiery water is turbid. Similarly, when clear water becomes broth, it naturally becomes cloudy.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Endless in thought, one’s desires remain unfulfilled. When one indulges externally and enters too deeply into the room of desire, their tendons weaken and hair turns white. Excess leads to a draining of essence, hence causing fatigue and weakness. The remedy for this is the Secret True Pill.</p>
<p>The Classic of Difficulties states: &quot;The condition relates to both the urinary passage and blockage. If the passage is blocked, urination cannot occur. Furthermore, blockage signifies an absence of release; all is due to pathogenic heat.&quot; Treatment lies in distinguishing between qi and blood. If thirst is present yet urination is difficult, it indicates heat in the upper jiao (thoracic cavity), hence the presence of thirst with poor urination. Urination is governed by the foot shaoyang bladder channel, which flourishes in the metal of the west. The lungs control the generation of water; if there is heat in the lungs, they cannot produce water, cutting off the source of fluids.</p>
<p>The text states: &quot;When there is deficiency, nourish the mother.&quot; Thus, one should clear the lungs and nourish their transformative source. Therefore, one should follow the essence of the lungs, assist with the autumn season, and water will naturally flow. Just as rain, dew, and frost descend from the heavens, they embody the yin within yang, reflecting that autumn qi descends from above. Furthermore, there are medicines with subtle qi that embody yin within yang; these are affected by the autumn’s cleansing and chilling air, thus able to supplement any deficiency in the lungs. Mild-flavored herbs that promote drainage are suitable for this purpose, such as Poria, Alisma, Amber, Lampwick, Glabrous Plantain, Mutong, Juxiang, and others, which clear lung qi, drain heat, and support the source of water.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If one is not thirsty but has difficulty urinating, it indicates heat in the lower burner affecting the blood component, which leads to lack of thirst and significant dryness, resulting in urinary obstruction. The heat is trapped in the lower burner involving the kidneys and bladder. Thus, when the yin is heated, it obstructs the upward flow, as described by Yi Lao: cold resides in the chest, blocking entry; heat in the lower burner causes stagnation and inconvenience. One must use the transformation of cold northern waters and medicines with cold properties to eliminate heat and relieve the obstruction. </p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: without yang, yin cannot be generated; without yin, yang cannot transform. If one takes medicines that are mildly diuretic, their nature is yin within yang, not purely yang, hence yang cannot transform, and how can one supplement the insufficiency of heavy yin? Rather, one should use earth-like waters yielding an intensely bitter taste, combined with heavenly cold medicines producing great cold energy; this energy and taste are entirely yin, representing yin within yin. The essence of great cold is received, leading to the generation of the bladder; the movement of cold waters leads to the generation of the kidneys. This medicine can supplement both the kidneys and bladder, countering the vigor of yang and the evil of heat, thereby causing urinary blockage. When using intensely bitter and cold medicines, treatment must approach cold due to heat. It is also stated that one must first address the main issue while considering the underlying cause, where the beginning shares similar energy, but the end diverges.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Methods</strong><br><em>By Zhu Zhenheng, Yuan Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>Lin (Dysuria)</strong></p>
<p>There are five types of dysuria, all associated with heat. To resolve heat and promote urination, one should use substances like gardenia fruit. Take one he (a unit of measurement) of peeled gardenia and consume it with white broth.</p>
<p>Dysuria refers to the condition where the urine dribbles, with a sense of urgency to urinate but inability to do so; it comes and goes, all as a result of heat. The causes of dysuria stem from kidney deficiency leading to heat in the bladder. When water and fire do not interact, the heart and kidneys become stagnant, causing disharmony between yin and yang, leading to the mixing of clarity and turbidity, and storage in the lower body. This results in a sudden urge from the bladder, along with mucus, blood, sand, and stones excreting through the urinary passage, thus manifesting as a feeling of urgency without relief, and worse, a blockage in between that can lead to severe discomfort.</p>
<p>In general, when the small intestine has gas, the urine becomes distended; when it has blood, the urine becomes thick; when it has heat, the urine becomes painful. Painful urination constitutes blood dysuria, while painless urination refers to blood in the urine. If there are remnants of sperm blockage, it results in sand; if sperm disperses, it leads to mucus; if there are stones, they result from heavy substances in the urine. Thick, frequent urination suggests gas. Understanding the fundamental causes helps classify them accordingly.</p>
<p>The method of treatment involves using agents that dispel stagnant gas, promote urination, and clear away evil heat, which also aids in balancing heart fire. When the heart is clear, urination will naturally become smooth; when the heart is balanced, blood will not flow indiscriminately. It is vital to avoid using tonics for qi, as that may alleviate pressure but increase distension; tonics for blood may worsen thickening; and tonics for heat will further intensify it. If water passages are obstructed and the channels are blocked, no beneficial effects can be observed.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Although the kidney qi is weak, and there is cold in the bladder, one may still experience a painful and frequent urination accompanied by cold sensations, first presenting as chills and then urination issues. This occurs because the cold qi and the righteous qi are in conflict; when the cold qi is strong, it leads to chills and results in painful urination, whereas when the righteous qi is strong, the chills resolve and normal urination occurs. </p>
<p>Additionally, when there is obstruction in the womb system, this should not be overlooked. An obstruction manifests as acute pain below the navel and difficulty in urination. Resisting the urge to urinate, whether upon sudden urgency, or while being full from food, riding a horse while needing to urinate, or holding it in while entering a bedroom, causes the water qi to reverse upward, pressuring the womb, preventing it from relaxing. If the womb collapses, it leads to demise.</p>
<p>Anuria (li) refers to obstruction; failing to pass urine results in anuria, while incontinence is classified as leakage. Dribbling, painful urination is referred to as lin, while urgent, distended, and obstructed urination is called bi. It is advisable to use Wuling San or Dengxin Decoction for treatment. If there is further distension below the navel, adding one tael of amber powder greatly enhances the effectiveness.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>For those with gonorrhea, if the various purgative medicines fail to alleviate, one should use a fragrance from wood and flow concoction, or alternatively a different fragrant remedy for dispelling gas that may bring recovery. This type of dysuria arises from the influence of both cold and heat. </p>
<p>Regarding blood dysuria, one must observe the color of the blood to determine whether it is due to hot or cold. If the color is bright red, it indicates excessive heat in the heart and small intestine; if it is purplish, it signifies deficiency and cold in the kidneys and bladder. For cases of cold dysuria and deficiency of the lower yuan with purplish blood, it is advisable to grind the root of the Chinese pepper, using it in any amount, decoct it in white water, and wait until it cools before consuming.</p>
<p>If extreme heat has led to dysuria and medication proves ineffective, one should reduce Gui Wu Ling powder and add a small amount of Mu Tong, Hua Shi, Deng Xin, and Qu Mai, mixing with honey water before taking. </p>
<p>All types of dysuria are attributed to heat. I often use Huangbo Zhi Shen Wan, combining it with Si Wu Decoction and adding Gan Cao Sho, Du Niu Xi, Mu Tong, Tao Ren, Hua Shi, and Mu Xiang in decoction. The mixture should be taken on an empty stomach, along with moxibustion at the San Yin Jiao point, following which one should feel the pulse like a drum, with repeated trials showing consistent effectiveness.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Red and White Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>Turbidity is governed by dampness and heat, accompanied by phlegm and deficiency. Red pertains to blood, while white pertains to qi. Dysentery and leucorrhea share similar treatments. Cold leads to hardness and stagnation, while heat promotes circulation.</p>
<p>Generally, it is damp phlegm that flows and gathers, so it is advisable to dry the dampness in the middle burner using Erchen Decoction supplemented with苍朮 (agrimony) and白朮 (white atractylodes) to eliminate the dampness. The red indicates that dampness has harmed the blood, thus white peony root should be added. Additionally, use pearl powder pills with臭椿根 (stinkwood root), white bark, talcum, and青黛 (indigo) to prepare pill medicine. For deficiency and fatigue, one should use yin-tonifying herbs, generally avoiding heat. </p>
<p><strong>[An alternate text suggests using cooling herbs.]</strong> </p>
<p>Individuals with a plump and white complexion are likely to have excess phlegm, thus Erchen Decoction should be used to remove damp heat. If the stomach is weak, ginseng should be included, along with柴胡 (bule), and升麻 (black cohosh) to boost the qi in the stomach. For pill medicine, use yellow bitter herb roasted to a brown color, dried ginger roasted slightly black, talcum, clam powder, and indigo, and then mix into pills for consumption.</p>
<p>Dampness and turbidity flow downward in the stomach, resulting in red and white turbidity. Use Erchen Decoction with柴胡,升麻,苍朮, and白朮. For pill medicine, use the ground powder of樗皮 (buckthorn), clam powder roasted, dried ginger roasted, and yellow bitter herb. If dampness flows down into the bladder, use indigo and clam powder. For a tight liver pulse, indigo should be used to drain the liver. Another formula consists of one liang of roasted yellow bitter herb, one liang of fresh bitter herb, three liang of talcum, and half a liang of shenqu (medicated leaven) ground into powder, mixed with water to form pills.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>To dispel dampness and phlegm, use a powdered mixture of South Star, Pinellia, clam powder, and indigo, and form it into pills with the indigo as a coating. For those with heat, a water pill made from indigo, talc, and yellow barberry is recommended. </p>
<p>Each of the five organs and six bowels of a person contains essence. However, the kidney stores essence and is governed by the heart, relying on the balance of water and fire for the internal holding of essence. If the regulation is inappropriate, thoughts are excessive, and desires are uncontrolled, the interchange of water and fire fails, causing the essence to be lost, leading to the issues of red and white turbidity. </p>
<p>Red turbidity arises from a deficiency of the heart coupled with heat, resulting from excessive contemplation. White turbidity is due to a deficiency of the kidneys with cold, arising from excessive lust. It appears swirl-like and white, glistening unevenly, while the base remains clear and thick like paste. </p>
<p>For treatment: for red turbidity, clear the heart and regulate the qi; for white turbidity, warm and tonify the lower source. Additionally, one must clear the upper area, so that water and fire harmonize, and yin and yang are in balance, allowing the essence and qi to secure themselves. </p>
<p>Er Chen Decoction treats turbidity, making the stools moist and prolonging urination. Turbidity is merely damp phlegm. Also, some with white turbidity who take Yuan Tu Dan may not improve, but improvement occurs with Fuzi Bawei Wan, which is crucial to know. There are also cases where urination appears normal, yet turbidity arises after prolonged retention.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Dream Emission</strong></p>
<p>Dream emission is primarily related to heat, similar to the conditions of discharges and seminal leakage. The treatment involves using indigo, sea stone, and yellow bile. When internal injuries affect the qi and blood, leading to weakness and inability to retain, one should regularly take Eight Ingredient Decoction and additionally consume the root of the swallow tree in pill form. </p>
<p>When thoughts lead to illness, and the affliction is in the heart, it is advisable to take peace-promoting pills along with tonics. If there is heat, circulation occurs, and one should use an equal mixture of Anemarrhena, yellow bile, clam powder, and indigo in pill form. The essence is slippery and relates to damp heat; yellow bile and Anemarrhena lower fire, while oyster and clam powders dry out dampness. </p>
<p>The causes of this condition are fourfold: excessive mental activity leading to a failure of the heart to contain the kidney energy, resulting in loss of essence; desires unfulfilled leading to the essence being misplaced and flowing out; excessive desire leading to uncontrollable leakage; or youthful vitality being abundant but long absence of sexual expression resulting in excess flow. </p>
<p>Symptoms vary: some may experience uncontrollable discharges after urination, while others might have leakage without urination, or experience itching and pain in the penis, often feeling as though they need to urinate. It is advisable first to take cinnabar aromatic powder, or a tranquilizing pill, or a clear drink, packaged with cotton along with dragon bone for boiling. Alternatively, take a clear drink with additional ingredients: fivefold fruit, oyster powder, white poria, and Schisandra each measured at half a qian and decocted for consumption.</p>
<p>Dream emission is commonly referred to as engaging with spirits in the night. It is recommended to take Warm Gallbladder Decoction with bamboo shavings, adding ginseng, distant will, lotus flesh, sour jujube seeds, and roasted poria each measured at half a qian.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Linjing (Dysuria)</strong></p>
<p>The five types of lin (dysuria) are blood, stone, qi, cream, and labor. Blood lin is characterized by the presence of blood in the urine. Stone lin shows the appearance of sand or stones in the urine, and there is a sound when urinating in a basin; this is due to essence and qi that have solidified into sand or stones, which are expelled along with the urine. Qi lin results from qi stagnation, presenting as a sensation in the lower abdomen akin to bladder pressure. Cream lin occurs when urine mixes with essence, appearing either as a thick paste sinking down or as a greasy substance floating on top. Labor lin arises from various colors in the urine, indicating a deficiency in the lower source, with clear and turbid not being separated, leading to sluggish kidney qi and its stasis resulting in dysuria. It may occur due to excessive mental strain, leading to insufficient nourishment of fire; the small intestine, being the excretory branch of the heart, may become ill concurrently. Additionally, it can stem from the heart and kidney not communicating, with kidney qi being unable to warm, or due to excessive sweating, or excessive blood loss, which may lead to depletion of fluids, all contributing to labor lin. These five are named, yet do not include hot and cold conditions, why is that? Because each of the five possesses attributes of both cold and heat.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>There are two types of blood: hot blood and stagnant blood; two types of qi: hot qi and cold qi; and two types of labor: deficient cold and deficient heat. If one mistakenly uses decoctions and medicines too hastily, without following the proper course, and fails to restrain reckless actions, one may suffer from the harm of hot agents—not to be regarded merely as cold. </p>
<p>The treatment should exclude true deficient cold; for other conditions, if the original prescription proves ineffective, one should appropriately employ rectifying qi agents. Understanding the balance of the pathways of fluids relies entirely on the flow and blockage of qi. For example, the Wood Fragrance Flowing Qi Drink is indeed suitable, comprising ingredients like Moutan, Ophiopogon, and possibly some others. If that proves ineffective, one should resort to formulas that enrich the blood, as urination reflects the surplus of blood. When the blood is ample, it nourishes and moistens downward, facilitating natural flow. </p>
<p>The Fire Palace Pill is appropriately tailored as well, containing Chinese Foxglove and similar herbs. However, this is not limited to just blood or qi stagnation; it can be used for any related issues, except for true deficient cold. In cases of urinary conditions, the urine color is often red; one should not hastily assume this signifies heat, for it can instead be due to the blockage of qi pathways, hence the appearance.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If there is a case of gonorrhea, using various laxatives may cure it. If it does not respond, using a herbal remedy to promote the flow of Qi may help; otherwise, using a different aromatic remedy for this purpose can also lead to recovery. This is known as Qi Lin, which occurs apart from hot or cold Lin issues.</p>
<p>There are cases that resemble Lin but are not Lin. When the urine is as discolored as rice washing water, or if it has a mucous-like appearance, this indicates both essence and urine are being expelled. The essence blocks the channels, causing a painful inability to urinate. It is advisable to use large doses of Cuscuta seeds pills or deer antler pills. However, this can also be considered as Gao Lin, meaning it cannot be dismissed as Lin altogether.</p>
<p>In the case of blood Lin, one must observe the color of the blood for signs of heat or cold: if the color is bright, it indicates excess heat in the heart and small intestine; if the color is dark and purplish, it means there is cold deficiency in the kidneys and bladder. For cold Lin and cases of deficiency in the lower abdomen with dark blood, it is advised to finely grind the roots of Sichuan pepper and boil them in water until cool for consumption.</p>
<p>When experiencing painful urination, with a constant urgent desire to urinate and struggling with drops, if the pain in the urethra is unbearable, this indicates a case of Five Lin diseases.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The raw ingredients of Wuling Powder are added to seven parts of donkey-hide gelatin, or a small amount of plantago seed is added to Wuling Powder, or equal parts of Wuling Powder and Yiyuan Powder can be mixed, or Wuling Powder may be combined with the fire-subduing pills, supplemented by Daohong Powder. </p>
<p>If heat leads to severe dripping and the medicine is ineffective, one should reduce the amount of cinnamon in Wuling Powder and add small amounts of mutong, talc, lamp wick, and qumai, while continuing to grind the roots of wheat, plantago, and white dragon grass, mixing them with honey water for consumption. </p>
<p>If there is blood in the dripping, one should add flavored Wuling Powder, or mix raw Wuling Powder with Wulin Decoction, or use Daohong Powder, and continue to grind the herb dianjincao with water for oral administration. If cold remedies worsen the condition, this indicates cold dripping, and one should take Dizui Decoction with eight formula pills. </p>
<p>If the person has difficulty urinating as if dripping, with no pain but itching, this too belongs to deficiency and should be treated with eight formula pills or raw deer antler pills. If the dripping is caused by excessive thought and mental strain, one should take the mercury and fragrant powder with Weixi pills or mix fragrant powder with Wuling Powder.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>White Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>There are individuals with white turbidity who do not improve even after taking Yuan Tu Dan, but do recover after taking the Fuzi Eight Flavor Pill; this should not be overlooked. There are cases where urination is normal, but after a long pause, it becomes turbid, and when urinated, appears like murky water. If it concerns a child suffering from malnutrition, it is advisable to prepare a clear drink with half a qian of white poria. If the medication has not been effective, it is recommended to take Si Qi Decoction, swallow Qingzhou White Pill, and Chen Sha Miao Xiang Powder, or take Yuan Tu Dan and small Cuscuta Pills, along with yam pills. If the white turbidity is severe, appearing muddy or thick and adhesive, with frequent abdominal pain, this is not due to hot lin (dysuria) but rather a blockage of the passageways due to turbid essence accumulating. The remedy should be the Wu Ling Miao Xiang Powder, along with the Eight Flavor Pill and small Cuscuta Pills. </p>
<p>Essence is transformed from blood; when there is excessive turbidity leading to insufficient essence transformation, resulting in a failure for red to turn white, it leads to red turbidity, indicating severe deficiency. How can this be determined? There are cases where individuals have yet to reach their prime, are overly vigorous, and experience a discharge that is half essence and half blood. If the urine is not red and there are no other heat symptoms, even if it appears turbid red, it should not be treated as heat; instead, one should apply treatments for white turbidity. If urine is red and the turbidity is also red, accompanied by thirst and fever, it is necessary to take Chen Sha Miao Xiang Powder and the Ling Sha Dan, or have a Clear Heart Lotus Seed Drink. If the fever persists and there is severe dryness of the mouth and tongue, this indicates internal dryness due to essence deficiency and kidney depletion; one should use Si Wu Decoction, swallow Yuan Tu Dan, and combine it with the Eight Flavor Pill for prolonged treatment to see results.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Semen Loss</strong></p>
<p>Semen loss occurs in four ways: first, when the mind is overly engaged and fails to regulate the kidneys, leading to loss of semen; second, when frustrated desires for sexual pleasure cause the semen to lose its proper place and leak out; third, when excessive desire causes uncontrolled discharge; and fourth, when youthful vigor is high and there has been a long absence of sexual desire, leading to an excessive outflow of vital energy. The symptoms vary; some may have frequent urination that is hard to control, while others may experience spontaneous discharge without urination, or a sensation of itch and pain in the genitals, often feeling the urge to urinate. </p>
<p>For treatment, one should initially use the Chen-sha Miao-Xiang Powder and swallow the Yu-hua Bai-Dan, paired with Wei-Xi Pills. Alternatively, one can prepare a clear drink, wrapping Long-gu in cotton and boiling it together, or make a clear drink with half of each ingredient: Wu-wei-zi, Bai Fu-ling, and Mu-li, each half a qian. </p>
<p>Dream-induced semen loss may also arise from heat in the meridians. If heat is treated with cold substances, it will worsen the semen loss. The original formula, Qing-xin Pill, with Huang-pi&#39;s essence, is most effective. Yet, one must confirm the presence of heat symptoms. If there is red moistness, it might also indicate internal heat, warranting this treatment. </p>
<p>If the condition arises from excessive mental effort, use Zhi-yuan Pills along with Jiao-gang Decoction, adding lotus seed flesh and Wu-wei-zi, and swallow them down, still supplementing with Ling-sha Dan. If it is determined to stem from frustrated desires, take Si-qi Decoction with white pills. In severe cases, even sounds and sights can trigger emission, termed &quot;white indulgence,&quot; for which Miao-Xiang Powder and Yu-hua Bai-Dan are recommended.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If one finds that the desire for sexual pleasure is excessive, leading to exhaustion of the lower body and uncontrolled leakage, it is advisable to take a tonic made from equal parts oyster powder and deer antler velvet, swallowing it with the nourishing pills or ling sha pill. Additionally, one may accompany this with capsules of deer antler, yam, epimedium, and other similar forms. </p>
<p>If the vital energy is strong and overflowing, the heart-clearing pill should be employed, together with a decoction of astragalus and ginger, even if not perfectly matched, it is necessary to dry the excessive essence for balance. </p>
<p>In cases of nocturnal emissions, which are commonly referred to as dream sex, it is advisable to use a warm gallbladder decoction minus bamboo shavings, adding half a portion each of ginseng, polygala, lotus seeds, jujube kernels, and poria. One should also take jade white pill and solid yang pill. </p>
<p>The nocturnal emissions may have the same characteristics as the previous symptoms, and one should carefully choose the appropriate medicine based on feelings experienced. </p>
<p>To treat painful sores from urinary leakage, use two and a half qians of brain tissue, one and a half qians of yellow lotus, one qian of licorice, seven scallions, a piece of dried lotus leaf, and a pinch of Sichuan pepper. First, boil the scallions, lotus leaf, and Sichuan pepper to make two bowls of soup, then let it cool and use for cleansing. Once the urine is clear, the licorice should be heated until red, soaked in the boiled yellow lotus water, then burned and soaked until the right consistency is achieved. After cooling, grind it into powder and mix with the brain. Use the previously prepared soup for hygiene, applying the medicine just two to three times to effect a cure.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Medical Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Semen Emission</strong></p>
<p>Dreaming of sexual intercourse leading to emission is addressed by the ancient sages with five treatments: </p>
<p>First, the ancient method involves using cinnabar, magnetite, and dragon bone to stabilize the wandering spirit. </p>
<p>Second, if thoughts create phlegm and confuse the heart&#39;s orifices leading to emission, Scholar Xu recommends pig fungus pills to guide the phlegm. </p>
<p>Third, for thoughts damaging the yin, use ancient pearl powder pills with clam powder and goldenseal to reduce heat and replenish yin. </p>
<p>Fourth, for thoughts damaging the yang, ingredients like deer antler, cistanche, and dodder seed are used to replenish yang. </p>
<p>Fifth, if both yin and yang are deficient, Danxi treats a thin person suffering from muddy dreams and emissions due to heart deficiency with pearl powder pills and the Calming Will Pill. The Calming Will Pill consists of subtlety, sweet flag, poria, and ginseng.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>There are several methods for treating nocturnal emissions: for those who are weak and exhausted, with insufficient essence, it is advisable to take Fennel Pills; for young and vigorous individuals who have long indulged in lust, causing stagnation in the meridians, it is advisable to take Clear Heart Pills; for those with emotional desires that stir, where wishes remain unfulfilled, termed &#39;white emissions&#39;, it is best to use a good formula called Poria Powder. This is just like a pot of soup that boils over when the heat is too strong; it spills out when the pot is tipped; and it leaks when there are cracks. Therefore, one must not use a single remedy indiscriminately. The classics say: &quot;When kidney Qi is blocked, essence leaks.&quot; The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: &quot;The kidney is the palace of strength, from which skillful talent emerges.&quot; It also states: &quot;The kidney stores essence.&quot; This is because the kidney is able to capture essence to procreate humanity, which may manifest or disperse, all governed by the kidney. Now, when kidney Qi is weak, the essence of the whole body cannot be properly contained, hence it goes astray and flows out inappropriately. The Zhu Ling Pill is formulated precisely for this reason.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Dreaming of Emission</strong></p>
<p>Dreaming leads to emission; many believe it is due to kidney deficiency and treat it with tonics aimed at replenishing the kidneys and replenishing essence, yet find no efficacy. Little do they know this condition often relates to the spleen and stomach, commonly seen in those who indulge in alcohol and rich foods, and who possess phlegm-heat and dampness. The kidneys store essence, which is generated from the sweet nourishment of the spleen and stomach and subsequently sent back to the kidneys. When the spleen and stomach are harmed by heavy substances, damp heat accumulates, leading to unclear central energy, which in turn causes the essence produced to also be impure. The kidneys govern storage and, when the Yin is still, all is at peace. However, if the essence delivered contains impure energy, then the evil fire stirs within the kidneys, disrupting the stillness of water, resulting in emissions that are slippery. This condition is akin to &quot;whitening.&quot; Dan Xi discusses &quot;whitening&quot; as the descending impure energy from the stomach infiltrating the bladder, asserting that no one understands this. Those who have overly heavy desires and excessive fantasies, leading to slippery emissions should be treated with both heart and kidney in mind. However, since many have simultaneous spleen and stomach issues, careful examination is required. </p>
<p>[Note: There are four types of emissions: one arising from excessive heart activity that fails to contain the kidneys; one caused by unmet desires leading the essence to lose its position; one from excessive sexual desire causing unrestrained slippery emissions; and one from a youthful vigor overflowing when there has been a long absence of sexual activity. Symptoms may include frequent involuntary urination, or a feeling of needing to urinate without actually doing so, or an itch and pain in the genitals, often accompanied by the urge to urinate. Recommended treatments include Shen Sha Miao Xiang San or Wei Xi Wan.]<br>Medical Entry Level 【Ming - Li Zhan】 </p>
<p><strong>Five Lin</strong><a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Lin, with painful and frequent urination, desire to urinate but unable, and when not urinating, the urge returns, dripping continuously. </p>
<p>Qi lin must be due to stagnation, with remnants not completely expelled. Use Shenxiang San or Yiyuan San, adding Fennel, Muxiang, and Areca nut. </p>
<p>Xue lin must be painful; it worsens with heat. Grind Baiwei and Chishao into a powder, mix with two qian of wine, or use Xijiao Dihuang Tang, Dan Cheqian Yin, or Siwu Tang with Zhi and Biexian. A bright color indicates empty heat in the heart and small intestine, use Daodi San removing licorice, adding Huangqin. A color like bean juice indicates heat in the kidneys and bladder, use Wulin San. </p>
<p>Additionally, a type of hematuria without pain is known as liuxue, not a lin condition. Use Siwu Tang with Zhizhi, Shilao, Niuxi, or singular Kuunaigai Yin, Danzhenhui San, or Dan Hupo San. </p>
<p>For Shi lin, there are sand and stones in the urine, with strong and severe pain; use Dan Niuxi Gao or Dan Bie Jia ground into powder, mixed with wine for oral administration. </p>
<p>For Gao lin, where the blood urine resembles paste, use one hundred twenty black beans, one inch of licorice, decoct in water; when nearly done, add one qian of Shilao powder, take on an empty stomach. Alternatively, use Haijinsha San. </p>
<p>For Lao lin, where pain radiates with qi disturbance and worsens with exertion, causing pain in the perineal area and buttocks; use Touge San. For exhaustion, use Siwu Tang with Zhi, Biexian, Shilao, and Hupo; for severe deficiency, use Lu Jiao Shuang Wan. </p>
<p>For Re lin, presenting with sudden severe pain, use Bazheng San or Wuling San, combined with Baidu San, plus Shigao Tang. For urgent pain, use Liuyi San (two qian), adding Muxiang, Banzhong, and Xianghuixia each one qian ground and administered orally.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Urinary difficulty, characterized by chills followed by painful and frequently urgent urination, swelling and pain in the passageways, may result in conditions like &quot;Shengfu San&quot; and &quot;Erzhong San.&quot; </p>
<p>Urinary issues are generally associated with heat, although there can be cases of cold. External factors like wind-cold can provoke symptoms, while internal factors such as emotional disturbances affect the heart and kidney energies, causing dysfunction in the small intestine and bladder. This can be exacerbated by anger, sexual activity, repression of urination, and consumption of alcohol and fatty foods, leading to damp heat that impedes the bladder. Initially, symptoms may present as heat or blood-tinged urination, while prolonged conditions can result in stones formed from heat, similar to how excessive boiling transforms a liquid into a concentrated substance.</p>
<p>When heat resides in the upper burner, causing thirst and difficulty in urination, it suggests latent heat in the lungs, resulting in an inability to disperse water. In such cases, it is advisable to use medications that are light and subtly diuretic to clear heat and nourish the origin of fluids, such as &quot;Qing Fei Yin.&quot;<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Heat in the lower jiao, with no thirst in the blood aspect and difficulty in urination, indicates a lack of yin in the kidneys and bladder, causing yang energy not to transform. Water dries up, and fire rises. Hence, herbs with both sour and cold properties should be used to eliminate heat, relieve obstruction, and nourish the source of water below. The Shenwan and Shenqi Pills are appropriate. The main complaint in consumption issues is thirst, which is classified under the blood aspect, hence there are thirst complaints in the blood aspect as well. Conversely, with painful urination as the primary issue, the blood aspect may not have thirst. However, when thirsty and excessively sweating leads to the depletion of body fluids, one should not take a light approach to this. </p>
<p>For treating summer heat strangury, heat strangury, blood strangury, one may rely on Shanzha (Hawthorn) alone; inducing sweating could be fatal. </p>
<p>For treating greasy strangury or stone strangury, use Yujin (Curcuma), Amber to open obstructed channels, Qingpi (Green Orange Peel), and Muxiang (Aucklandia) to move qi, Puhuang (Catkins), and Niuxi (Achyranthes) to break blood stagnation, Huangbo (Amur Cork Tree), and Shengdi (Raw Rehmannia) to nourish yin. According to Dongyuan&#39;s approach, for any small abdominal pain, Qingpi should be used to soothe the liver, and Huangbo to nourish the kidneys, as the lower abdomen and urination relate to the liver and kidney regions.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>If there is severe bloating in the lower abdomen, use Shen Tang and Huo Fu Dan. Generally, if gas is present in the intestines, it causes bloating; if there is blood, it leads to diarrhea; if there is heat, it results in pain. Additionally, when the earth is dry and fire is turbid, use Si Jun Zi Tang with added Hua Shi, Ze Xie, Mai Dong, and Zhu Ye. If there is pain, use Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Zhi, Bo He, Shi Wei, and Hu Po. </p>
<p>For stagnation of liver qi with heat, use five qian of Gan Cao Shao, and one qian each of Qing Pi, Huang Bo, and Ze Xie, decocted in water. Alternatively, use San Wei Ting Li San. If the pain radiates to the flanks, use Shen Ling Hu Po Tang. If the intestinal pain radiates to the lower back, use Ci Shi Tang. For deficiency, use Qing Gan Jie Yu Tang or Qing Gan Yi Rong Tang. </p>
<p>For kidney deficiency with dripping and pain in the genital area, add and subtract from Ba Wei Wan to tonify yin.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>If the urine is frequent and yellow, use Si Wu Decoction with added ginseng, atractylodes, ophiopogon, and schisandra to nourish the lungs and kidneys. If the urine is short and yellow, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added ophiopogon, schisandra, and yam to strengthen the spleen and kidneys. For heat congealing the bladder, use Wu Ling San to clear heat. If the spleen and lung qi is dry, use qin and zhi to clear the lungs. If there is kidney yin deficiency with insufficient yang, use Zi Shen Wan. If there is bladder yang deficiency with insufficient transformation, use Shen Qi Wan.</p>
<p>If essence is depleted, a young man whose essence has not fully developed engages with a woman, or an old man with diminished essence thinks of sex, resulting in loss of essence, leading to internal depletion and pain in the genitals resembling dysuria, use Ba Wei Wan with added plantago seeds and achyranthes, decoct to take. If essence is already depleted and there is further drain, there will be pulling pains in urination, causing increased urgency to urinate, worsening pain with more urination. Resolve with additional aconite.</p>
<p>In all these cases, it is necessary to nourish and remedy, avoiding the use of diuretics such as renshen and procedures that drain true yang while further harming true yin. When middle qi is weak and cannot transport fluids down to the bladder, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If there is excessive sweating leading to loss of body fluids, prolonged diarrhea causing dry stomach, and various sores losing blood, all these require nourishment and should not have excessive diuretics.</p>
<p>Phlegm accumulated in the lungs can obstruct the bladder, similar to a closed opening on a water kettle preventing outflow, hence use Er Chen Decoction to expel phlegm or moxa at the Baihui point to open the upper pathway. Although the bladder governs the water pathway, the lungs generate the transformation of water. If there is twisting pain in the lower abdomen, coupled with urgency and pain, and difficulty in urination, it is termed as &quot;twisted bladder.&quot;<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If there is heat causing pressure or if one is forcibly holding back urine, leading to a reversal of qi and unusual pain, take a mixture of two stones with equal parts of carlinae and mu tong, and decoct in water; externally, apply fried salt to the navel, replacing it when it cools. </p>
<p>For issues related to qi, first use ginger, scallion white, and perilla leaves to make a decoction to steam and wash the lower abdomen, outer kidneys, and anus. Dry off and stretch your legs while lying on your back. Then take equal parts of sunflower seeds, red poria, red peony, and white peony, add a pinch of salt, and decoct them together with suhexiang pills for consumption. </p>
<p>For those who endure urine while rushing or after a full meal, use Erchen Decoction to induce vomiting. </p>
<p>For those who endure urine while being intimate, take the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to help. If the Yin is deficient and both the cun and chi pulses are weak, and if taking various slippery and unblocking medicines produces no effect, then take Kidney Qi Pills. For Yang deficiency, use Eight Flavor Pills; or alternatively, equal parts of fuzi and zeze may be decocted and consumed. This condition is serious and is often found in individuals with thin bodies and impatient temperaments. </p>
<p>For bladder obstruction, which is akin to cold dysuria, characterized by painful urination pulling at the navel, and accompanied by clear nasal discharge, use Kidney Decoction; if it is heat-related, use Kidney Drainage Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Red and White Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>In cases of damp heat in the spleen and stomach, with the middle jiao being unclear, turbid qi infiltrates the bladder creating turbidity. In hot summer months, all trees release moisture. </p>
<p>The &quot;red&quot; signifies severe damp heat in the blood aspect, primarily governed by the heart and small intestine, treated with Daochi San, Siwu and Erchen Decoction, adding Ziziphi Spinosae Cortex, Qingdai, and Huashi. </p>
<p>The &quot;white&quot; indicates mild damp heat in the qi aspect, primarily governed by the lungs and large intestine, treated with Qingxin Lianzi Drink, or Wujisan combined with Sijunzi Decoction. </p>
<p>Individuals who are overweight often have damp phlegm, treated with Erchen Decoction plus Cangzhu and Baizhu. For red turbidity, add Bai Shao; for qi deficiency, add Ren Shen and Huang Qi; for summer heat damage, add Ze Xie, Mai Men Dong, and Ren Shen; for wind damage, add Fang Feng; for accompanying cold, add Jiang and Gui; in severe cases, add Fuzi. If there is heat, add Huangbo, Rizhao, and Shanzhi; or use Xingshen Bansha Powder pills. Should phlegm arise from emotional distress, use Siqi Decoction.</p>
<p>For lean individuals with damp fire, apply Jiawei Xiaoyao San or Siwu Decoction with Zhimu and Huangbo, or use Zhenzhu Powder pills and Ziziphi Spinosae pills. For deficiency combined with phlegm fire, use Shenqi Pills and Buxin Pills.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>One must not use purely cold herbs as they harm the blood, nor purely warming herbs as they increase heat. Cold leads to solidity, while heat facilitates movement; both should be cleared upward and held downward. For those whose thoughts and worries lead to a depletion of heart and spirit, remedies include Miao Xiang San, Shi Wei Wen Dan Tang, and Jin Lian Wan. For those wanting to avoid damaging kidney essence, suitable treatments are Pi Xie Fen Qing Yin, Xiao Tu Si Zi Wan, Shen Qi Wan, and Ba Wei Wan. If both heart and kidney are deficient without fire, Huan Shao Dan is recommended. For severe, unbearable pain in the lower abdomen due to cold, Cooked Dong Gui Wan should be administered. </p>
<p>In cases of dry earth and clear water disrupting the spleen due to excessive thinking, since essence is derived from grains, it is advisable to tonify the stomach and supplement the spleen; for this, use Er Chen Tang with Sheng Ma and Chai Hu to enhance stomach qi. If there is phlegm-heat that could exacerbate phlegm and fullness in the chest, additional ingredients like Zhi Ke, Xiang Fu, Shen Qu, and Bai Zhu are necessary, or one may induce vomiting to alleviate it. For those suffering from deficiency and wasting, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang is helpful. If spleen dampness is not well-contained, remedies include Cang Zhu Nan Ming Dan, Si Miao Gu Zhen Dan, Bai Zhu Gao, and Wei Xi Wan, along with more severe remedies like Gu Long Li Wan, Shi Lian San, and Yuan Zhi Wan.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Dream Loss</strong></p>
<p>The essence commingling, though often having a small white membrane wrapped within the kidneys, the original essence is indeed rooted in the heart. Thoughts during the day lead to dreams at night where one loses it. The treatment should be Huang Lian Qing Xin Decoction, or Shi Wei Wen Dan Tang, Miao Xiang San, and Ding Zhi Wan. </p>
<p>The essence of the human body is more valuable than gold and treasure. Initially, due to the instability of the sovereign fire, over time the intermingling fire usurps power. When the original essence moves and does not stabilize, it can result in repeated nightly losses, and during the day it can slip away continuously, thus the use of Kan Li Wan is advised. </p>
<p>With excessive fire, there may be many red threads in the essence, which can be seen in the urine when viewed closely. Even if a child is born, within a year, red thread tumors may appear and cannot be saved. For this, Yin Jiao Wan and Shen Qi Wan are recommended. </p>
<p>The qi should descend, while the essence should ascend. When the heart stirs, the essence follows the thought and departs; prolonged stagnation can cause itch and pain in the stem, often like the urge to urinate.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>There are cases where semen is expelled either through urination or flows out spontaneously, which is called &quot;sperm leakage.&quot; This is even more severe than nocturnal emissions.

<p>If this condition persists for a long time, it may lead to a deficiency of Yang and a cold sensation, similar to water diminishing and fire becoming overly dry, in which case one should use the Nourishing Yin and Reducing Fire Decoction. If the Yang fire is imbalanced and the ministerial fire overwhelms the spleen, with dampness and heat combining, and the spleen being entirely deficient, leading to minimal digestion and susceptibility to invasion, the use of mothball pills is recommended. </p>
<p>For those with weak spleens, the San Hui Mothball Pills or Pork Stomach Pills should be used. If it is not due to the Heart and Kidneys not communicating, but rather caused by excessive drinking of rich food, it leads to damp heat being internally stagnant, which clouds the central qi, causing the essence that is generated to be turbid, returning to the kidneys, and thus water becomes unsettled, resulting in leakage. It is advisable to add herbs that nourish Yin, such as ginseng, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, to enhance the clear qi in the stomach, and it is also important to regulate diet to strengthen the root of life.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Ah! The essence character is composed of rice and blue, born from the pure qi of the valley. Those who nurture life should savor it! After the age of forty, labor damages the qi and blood, making it hard to retain; one should modify the Yangrong Decoction, take Dan Chao Pi Pill, or sometimes take Xiao Tu Si Zi Pill. If one wishes to overcome Yang脱 in youth, one can use Jiuyuan Xin Shen Pill, Qing E Pill, Hei Xi Dan, Suo Quan Pill, or Jin Suo Zheng Yuan Dan. If qi is lost, use Shen Xiong Decoction.</p>
<p>It is said that a young man who has not had sexual relations for a long time, and overflows with essence, is truly laughable. In a person&#39;s organs, there are only qi and blood, while the spirit governs within, without any visible form. It can be seen that essence is formed through the interaction of the fires of the three energizers in a moment; it could not have been stored within beforehand, right? Only by regulating color, as qi and blood gradually increase does the essence not become thin and unclear; this is the principle.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Those who do not control themselves and experience leakage may, at times, hear of lewd matters, see beautiful forms, or think of endless desires. When what they wish for is unattainable, or when they have entered a chamber too passionately, their sexual tension may loosen, leading to a release of essence known as &quot;white leakage.&quot; The kidneys store the essence of life; if one acts with restraint, focusing inward can preserve and strengthen the essence. Forsaking external desires and avoiding excessive indulgence in the household may lead to leakage and lack of vitality. Using the Huang Bo pill is most effective.</p>
<p>There are also those who cultivate serenity through quiet sitting and nurture their spirit, yet even they may not escape the occasional stirrings of lust. Some may be misled by blind guides who claim that certain practices can stop leakage; however, faced with temptation, feelings may be forgotten, and true inclination no longer lingers on vulgar matters. Thus it is said: &quot;One cannot ascend to immortality while indulging in lust; steamed rice cannot be made if one has not ceased the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who seek to nourish life should proceed with caution! Commonly used remedies include the single Schisandra fruit paste, Golden Cherry paste, the Two Immortals Elixir from land and water, Golden Lock Essence Pill, Foxnut Pill, Autumn Stone Pill for consolidating the truth, Firm Essence Pill, Single Chive Seed Powder, Joyful Pill, Stone Lotus Powder, and Golden Cherry Pill.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Essential Reading for Medical Scholars</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Li Zhongzi</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Various Types of Lin Syndrome</strong>  </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; Lin syndrome is associated with both dampness and heat. The &quot;Discussion of Disease Origins&quot; states that the bladder and kidneys are interrelated and both govern water. Water enters the small intestine and relates to bodily excretions. If one does not regulate their diet or emotions, or if there is an imbalance of deficiency and excess, or disharmony within the organs, it can lead to kidney deficiency and bladder heat. Kidney deficiency results in frequent urination, while bladder heat leads to painful and urgent urination. When there is urgency and pain, it may be classified into six types: stone lin, labor lin, blood lin, qi lin, greasy lin, and cold lin. </p>
<p>Stone lin consists of gravel-like particles caused by heat accumulating in the bladder, similar to how minerals might accumulate at the bottom of a pot if it is left over a fire for too long. Labor lin occurs due to exhaustion, often linked to spleen deficiency. Blood lin results from the heart governing blood, as residual heat affects the small intestine and interacts with blood vessels, leading blood to mix with urine during excretion.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>In the case of qi lin, the lungs govern qi; when the transformation of qi does not reach the region, it causes a buildup of qi in the body, leading to fullness and hardness in the lower abdomen, with excessive dripping during urination. In the case of gao lin, there is a dripping of fatty fluid, resembling oil or fat. For leng lin, cold invades the lower body, obstructing the water pathways. Symptoms begin with chills and shivering, followed by the formation of lin. </p>
<p>Additionally, excessive consumption of minerals, or overly vigorous intercourses, can harm essence and cause it to flow into the body, resulting in damp phlegm that develops into lin over time. Consequently, the causes of lin are numerous, and without addressing the root, one cannot expect to recover. </p>
<p>To clear the accumulated heat of shi lin and eliminate stones and sand, the water pathways can be naturally improved, using remedies such as Shenxiao HuPo San, RuSheng San, or DuSheng San, selected based on symptoms. </p>
<p>Lao lin can be differentiated into spleen-related lao and kidney-related lao. Excessive thinking and worrying, heavy lifting, long travels, and social obligations exhaust the spleen, so the remedies should include Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Wu Ling San. For issues mainly rooted in worry, Gui Pi Tang should be used. Conversely, if excessive vigor during intercourse or unrestrained discharges exhaust the kidneys, Sheng Di Huang Wan or Huang Qi Tang should be considered. In the case of kidney deficiency accompanied by cold, Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan is recommended.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>There are distinctions in blood conditions: blood stasis, blood deficiency, blood cold, and blood heat. If the lower abdomen is hard and full, and there is severe pain in the genitals, this indicates blood stasis. One should take a decoction of cow knee for effective relief. However, for the weak constitution, this may harm the stomach, so one should use the Four Substance Decoction with added peach kernel, reed root, safflower, cow knee, and moutan bark. For blood deficiency, one can take Six Flavor Pill with added Platycladus leaves, plantain seeds, and white peony root, or Eight Treasure Decoction followed by Yiyuan Powder. If the blood color is bright red, it indicates real heat in the heart and small intestine, and the pulse will be rapid and strong. Herbs include persimmon calyx, Platycladus leaves, Coptis, yellow vine, raw rehmannia, moutan bark, white peony root, akebia, water plantain, and poria. If the blood color is dark and dull, and the complexion is pale, with a deep and slow pulse, this indicates deficiency and cold in the lower source. One can use Kidney Qi Pill or decoct five to six qian of Sichuan pepper root and take it cool. However, if there is extreme internal heat accompanied by water transformation leading to black color, it should not be hastily assumed to be cold. One must differentiate carefully using pulse and symptoms. There are also distinctions in qi conditions between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>If there is stagnation of qi, leading to obstruction and pain beneath the navel, use Chenxiang San, Shiwai San, or Qu Mai Tang. For those with qi deficiency, use Ba Zhen Tang with added Du Zhong and Niu Xi, and double the Ru Ping. </p>
<p>For gao lin (a type of urinary issue), which may resemble a lingering condition, the urine may be colored like rice wash or nasal mucus, indicating both essence and urine are expelled, causing obstruction in the urinary pathway, thus resulting in pain and discomfort. Use Lujiao Shuang Wan, Da Chenxiang San, Chenxiang Wan, Haijinsuo San, or Tusizi Wan as per the symptoms. </p>
<p>Cold lin is often due to kidney deficiency; use Rou Congrong Wan, Zexie San, or Jinkui Shenqi Wan. </p>
<p>For pelvic obstruction, the bladder is considered the storage organ for fluids; when qi cannot transform and expel these fluids due to the invasion of wind, cold, and damp pathogens, it leads to fullness in the bladder and blocked water pathways. If one presses on the lower abdomen, there will be internal pain, as if it is being poured with soup; this results in difficulty urinating. The pathways following the Taiyang channel lead to the forehead, impacting the brain and causing a runny nose. Use Shen Zhuo Tang, Shen Li Tang, or Ba Ji Wan. </p>
<p>Pulse characteristics: </p>
<p>In the Shaoyin pulse, if it is rapid, women may develop sores in the yin, while men may experience lin syndrome. A strong and full pulse indicates life, while a weak and small pulse indicates death. </p>
<p>Regarding nocturnal emissions.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>According to ancient and modern perspectives, involuntary semen loss is generally viewed as a condition of weakened kidney energy, not affecting other organs. However, it is unknown that the classics state each of the five organs and six bowels contains essence, with the kidneys being the receiver and reservoir. If one experiences involuntary loss without dreaming, it is largely due to heart and kidney damage; if it occurs after dreaming, it is mainly harmful due to excessive fire (passion). When all five organs are fulfilling their roles, essence is stored and regulated. If even one organ fails in its proper function, it can negatively impact the essence controlled by the heart and kidneys. </p>
<p>The treatment method differs: for loss directly caused by kidney issues, one treats the kidneys. If caused by other organs, both the affected organ and the kidneys are treated. For instance, if the heart is ill and leads to loss, it is likely due to a deficiency in blood vessels; if caused by the lungs, it is due to insufficient vitality, resulting in shortness of breath; if by the spleen, one may notice yellowing skin and weakness in limbs; if by the liver, the complexion turns green and muscle weakness follows; if the kidneys are involved, the complexion turns dark and the marrow may be depleted. </p>
<p>It is necessary to consult the six pulses for further clarity on diagnosis, as the causes may be diverse. If excessive mental strain prevents the heart from regulating the kidneys, resulting in loss, it is advisable to use &quot;Yuan Zhi Wan&quot; and complement it with &quot;Ling Sha Dan.&quot; If loss is due to unfulfilled desires, one may take &quot;Si Qi Tang&quot; with white pills. In severe cases where stimulation leads directly to loss, referred to as &quot;white indulgence,&quot; one should take &quot;Miao Xiang San&quot; with &quot;Yu Hua Bai Dan.&quot; If desires are excessive, leading to slippery essence, one should use &quot;Zheng Yuan San&quot; mixed with equal parts oyster shell powder and Herba Cistanchis, swallow with &quot;Ling Sha Dan,&quot; and also supplement with deer antler pills, Chinese yam pills, Cuscuta pills, and solidifying yang pills. For robust men experiencing persistent stagnation and overflowing essence, &quot;Qing Xin Wan&quot; is recommended.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>For those who indulge in rich wine, with phlegm-fire and damp heat disturbing the essence, the following remedies are recommended: Atractylodes, White Atractylodes, Banxia (Pinellia), Tangerine Peel, Poria, Licorice, Angelica, and Bupleurum, to facilitate the clearing of turbidity and reduction of excess. Strengthening the spleen and stomach will then halt the excessive flow. For those with a deficiency in the spleen leading to descent, take the Baizhu Yiqi Decoction. For those with a deficiency in the kidneys causing instability, two taels of Gallnut and four taels of Poria should be made into pills and taken, with miraculous effects. However, the symptoms differ. Some may experience excessive urination that cannot be controlled, while others may not urinate at all but experience involuntary discharge, or have itching pain in the genitals often accompanied by the urge to urinate, or dream of copulating with women. Each situation should be treated accordingly based on previous methods.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>There may indeed be phantoms that connect with one, appearing reluctant to meet people; when confronted, they sometimes engage in laughter and at other times in weeping. The pulse fluctuates, sometimes strong and sometimes weak, appearing and disappearing, and when it flows continuously without a clear measure while the complexion remains unchanged, such is their sign. It is advisable to use substances like vermilion, orpiment, musk, ghost arrow, and tiger bone, or simply take the Suhe pill for its miraculous efficacy. </p>
<p>Moreover, for those who have been in prolonged solitude or indulged excessively, engaging with women and experiencing an unending discharge, this is referred to as &quot;losing yang.&quot; The woman must hold firm to prevent the penis from exiting, and urgently blow warm air from her mouth while pinching the tailbone to provide relief. If a woman is startled and pulls away, there is a 90% chance of death; one should quickly use a young girl to channel energy and administer a large dose of ginseng soup, which can sometimes bring the person back to life. </p>
<p>In summary, refine the essence, as it is preferable to thick; if thick but ineffective, drain the heart fire; if draining is ineffective, then supplement with Zhongyiqi using 1 or 2 qian of Schizonepeta and Bupleurum to raise the energy upwards instead of letting it fall, which can often be effective. Can one really expect supplementation to work if the thick essence holds no vitality? Thus, it is left to fate, indeed.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>Upon examining the classical texts and studying the arguments of previous philosophers, it is understood that turbidity disorders are indeed disorders of essence, not disorders of urine. Therefore, those suffering from turbidity experience sensations like being cut by a knife or burned by fire within the stem, while the urine remains clear. Only at the urethral opening is there irregular discharge, akin to pus from a sore or the residue from the eyes, dripping continuously without blending with regular urination. Generally, turbidity arises from a deterioration of essence and corruption in about 60-70% of cases, while about 20-30% are due to damp heat influx and deficiency. As for the distinction between red and white, what is the reason? Essence is transformed from blood; if too much turbidity is expelled and essence is insufficiently transformed, the red doesn’t turn white, thus resulting in red turbidity, which indicates severe deficiency. In youth, before reaching maturity, vigorous sexual activity leads to a discharge that is a mix of essence and blood. In middle age, excessive release also produces mixed essence and blood. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that Danqi&#39;s association of red with blood and white with qi is entirely accurate. Furthermore, the association of red with heart deficiency and heat, arising from overthinking, and white with kidney deficiency and cold, stemming from excessive desires, is also not definitive.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>In summary, when the heart is stirred by desire, the kidneys suffer from indulgence; either one forcibly endures sexual activities or excessively consumes aphrodisiacs, leading to the loss of essence and resulting in a white turbid discharge. When one experiences slippery conditions, the blood fails to transform, resulting in a red turbid discharge. If there is cold, the pulse becomes deep and slow with little strength, and urination is clear; treatments like Bi-xie Fen-qing Drink, Ba-wei Pill, and Neibu Lu-rong Pill are recommended. If there is heat, thirst and red urine occur, with a rapid and strong pulse; treatments such as Qingxin Lianzi Drink and Xiangling Powder are advised. In cases where phlegm-dampness accumulates in the stomach, use Cangbai Erchen Decoction with Shengma and Chaihu. For cases of deficiency or consumption, add Liumei Pill with Lianxu, Qian-shi, Tu-si-zi, Wuwu, Longgu, and Mu-li. If due to excessive summer heat, add Xiangru and Maidong to Si-ling Powder and Ren-shen, along with Shilian Meat or similar ingredients. If the condition is sticky and painful, it means essence is obstructing the pathways; administer Xiangling Powder with Ba-wei Pill or Jinkui Shenqi Pill. If there is heat, recommend Bi-xie Fen-qing Drink and Fuling Pill. For excessive thoughts leading to emotional disturbance, essence exhausts in the lower region; use flavored Qingxin Drink or Ruilian Pill, and this gives a general outline. As for the injuries to the five organs and changes due to the six excesses, it is hard to enumerate; when faced with clinical situations, be cautious and do not be careless!<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Zhengzhi Zhunsiang</strong> 【Ming Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>Lyin</strong></p>
<p>The disease of lyin (dysuria) is noted in the &quot;Disease Source Treatise&quot; as resulting from kidney deficiency and bladder heat. The bladder and kidneys are internally and externally linked, both governing water. Water enters the small intestine and, in conjunction with the bladder, results in urination. If one’s diet is irregular, emotions are unregulated, there is an imbalance of deficiency and excess, and the internal organs are not harmonious, this leads to kidney deficiency and bladder heat. When the kidneys are deficient, urination becomes frequent; when there is bladder heat, there is a painful and urgent flow of urine, leading to a condition of lyin. </p>
<p>Its symptoms include sharp pain in the lower abdomen, stretching from below the navel, scanty urination, and different types of lyin: stone lyin, labor lyin, blood lyin, qi lyin, grease lyin, and cold lyin. Stone lyin presents with particles like sand; labor lyin occurs after physical exhaustion; blood lyin arises when the heart governs blood and qi, and extreme heat obstructs blood, causing it to blend with urine; grease lyin presents with a fatty, oily discharge, also known as meat lyin; qi lyin is marked by internal gas, a hardened lower abdomen, scant and frequent urination, with residual dribbling; cold lyin occurs when cold air invades the lower body, leading to conflict between pathogenic and healthy qi, causing fullness in the bladder and interrupted water flow. One first feels chills and then the frequency of urination increases to form lyin, thus presenting the full nature of the ailment. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the causes of lyin do not stop here. In summary, there are two main factors: moisture and heat.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The text refers to the phenomena of various bodily ailments and their underlying causes. It states that when the yin (the moon) creates the initial Qi, there is an infusion of heat during illness, leading to swelling, with the spleen affected by dampness, resulting in dark yellow urine, and in severe cases, painful urination. The lesser yang creates a second Qi, where wind and fire become trapped above, causing heat and diseases like painful urination.</p>
<p>It explains that the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians are interconnected, which is why the greater yang governs the surface of the body. When it rises, it commands all Yang Qi, and when it descends, it enters the bladder. Additionally, the lungs regulate the flow of fluids and send them to the bladder. The spleen and stomach digest water and grains; if there is heat, then all liquids become hot, and as they are transported downward, the bladder receives them as heated.</p>
<p>The small intestine is linked to the heart and is responsible for heat. Its fluids seep into the bladder, and if heat manifests in the heart, the small intestine must also be hot. The bladder then heats from this, leading to symptoms like blood in the urine. This indicates that the initial heat pathogen is varied, but they all eventually transfer to the bladder, causing painful urination. If one does not first treat the underlying cause but instead focuses on the heat in the bladder, the treatment will not be effective.</p>
<p>The author reflects on how painful urination is primarily caused by severe heat leading to dampness, which, in turn, causes fluids to become turbid, coagulating into painful urination. Moreover, those who excessively consume medicinal minerals or engage in sexual activity may cause seminal fluid to flow into the bladder, contributing to the issue, as can the accumulation of phlegm and food.</p>
<p>There’s an example of a child who, while in the womb, suffered from the residual toxins of medicinal minerals taken for a long time, developing painful urination for fifteen years, which was cured with a remedy. The essential point is that one cannot effectively treat an illness without addressing its root cause.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Red and White Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>The path of urine differs from that of essence: gonorrhea pertains to the pathway of urine, which is why it is classified under the liver and gallbladder sections in the &quot;Compendium&quot;; turbidity pertains to the essence pathway, hence it is classified under the kidney and bladder sections. Those suffering from turbidity may experience severe pain in the urethra like being cut by a knife or burned by fire during urination, yet the urine itself remains clear. Only at the opening might there be refuse, such as pus from sores or eye discharge, trickling continuously, initially not mixed with urination, much like the flow in a river, making it easy to distinguish. Often, I have seen physicians treat it as gonorrhea, using Wu Ling and Ba Zheng formulas, continuously mixing them, yet this exacerbates the condition countless times; I have often corrected this but found it difficult to make this known widely. This is mostly due to the degradation and corruption of essence in nine out of ten cases, while only one out of ten arises from damp heat and deficiency.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Night Emission</strong></p>
<p>Danxi&#39;s writings divide dream emissions and fluid emissions into two categories. Dream emissions occur through interactions with spirits during dreams, while fluid emissions that do not originate from dreams are referred to as fluid emissions. Nevertheless, both are ultimately classified as nocturnal emissions. The treatment methods are the same, hence they are grouped together.</p>
<p>If one asks what causes fluid emissions, it is said: The &quot;Golden Coffer&#39;s Essentials&quot; states that diseases of deficiency and exertion are characterized by a floating, strong pulse, restlessness in the hands and feet, and coldness with the essence leaking out. It also states that when the pulse is wiry and strong, it is termed &quot;leather,&quot; signifying the loss of blood and essence. Furthermore, when the lower abdomen feels tense and the external genitalia are cold, the pulse is slightly tightening, which indicates a loss of essence in men and dream interactions in women.</p>
<p>According to Tong&#39;s &quot;Sources of Illness,&quot; the diseases of deficiency and exertion are classified into categories such as Five Exertions, Seven Injuries, Six Extremes, and Twenty-Three Steams, with the connection of essence noted among the Seven Injuries. Originally written as &quot;essence connections,&quot; it is altered here based on the &quot;Discussion of Disease Sources&quot; referencing deficiency-related conditions. The steaming condition termed &quot;jade chamber steaming,&quot; in men results in leaking essence, alongside other symptoms of essence loss, all of which are mixed within the category of deficiency diseases. Since the kidneys are responsible for storing essence, all are regarded as diseases resulting from weakened kidney energy, implying no damage to other organs.</p>
<p>Is it truly so? All five organs are involved in essence storage. Upon examining the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; it first states that what heaven represents in me is virtue. What the earth represents in me is energy; virtue flows and energy thins, thus leading to life. Therefore, the essence that derives from this is called &quot;essence,&quot; and the mingling of two essences is termed &quot;spirit.&quot; Thus, it can be said that this governs and commands the spirit of the entire body.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>The heart and kidneys are the organs of water and fire, embodying the principles of how heaven and earth transform and generate. Therefore, the storage of spirit is the fundamental source of the five organs. </p>
<p>Next, the way to engage with things is called the heart. The heart&#39;s memories are referred to as intention; intention, when anchored, is called will. From will stems change, known as thought; from thought comes longing, known as concern; and from concern arises interaction with the world, called wisdom. All of these arise from the heart&#39;s spirit responding to external stimuli, which is known as the five intentions, giving rise to the designation of the five spiritual organs. </p>
<p>Once the five spirits are differentiated, they each govern their respective functions related to virtue, governance, and nature. Thus, the water and fire of the heart and kidneys conform to the ranks of the five spirits. However, the principal spirit they govern remains concurrent and has never been separate; while the five spirits and five changes are categorized, the essence also transforms according to the spirit, integrating wherever it goes. Therefore, each of the five organs must harbor its spirit to fulfill its function, which is called the true essence of the organs. This represents the vitality of the primary energy.</p>
<p>If the true essence of any organ is not properly aligned, then disease in that organ will arise. If the spirit of one organ is significantly harmed, it will inevitably damage the primary spirit governing the heart and kidneys. For instance, excessive anxiety and overthinking harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to unchecked desire. Joy and fear also damage essence; when essence is harmed, bones weaken, leading to decay and paralysis. </p>
<p>Those who govern essence must not be harmed; if harmed, they will lose their hold and become yin deficient. When yin is deficient, energy is depleted, and without energy, death ensues.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>In this way, when the spirit resides in the five organs, if injured, then indulgence and evils will arise. The heart, in its will, is associated with joy; in its energy, it represents fire and heat. The kidneys, in their will, relate to fear; in their energy, they signify water and cold. Thus, excessive fright and worry can harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fire stirs incessantly. When fire stirs incessantly, the water of the kidneys is overwhelmed by fear. Fear, if not resolved, stirs within, causing injury to the kidneys. The kidneys govern the storage of essence, and the essence received from the five organs and six bowels cannot be retained and will descend in excess. This is said in relation to the heart and kidneys, which control the spirit.</p>
<p>As for the essence of the other organs, do they all leak out? The text from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to excessive indulgence, loosening the reproductive muscles, which results in white indulgence, and its ailment is muscular atrophy. Muscular atrophy arises within the liver. The commentary indicates that white indulgence refers to a discharge resembling essence, flowing downwards in urine. Although it is said to resemble essence, it is likely not the essence that has transformed but consists of that which has not yet fully formed. </p>
<p>Why is this stated? There are two types of essence: the innate essence that one is born with; and that which is derived from food and air entering the stomach, dispersing essence throughout the five organs. There is also the essence derived from water and drink, transmitted from the spleen and lungs to the kidneys, spreading throughout the body; this is the daily essence produced from food. All the daily-produced essence is transformed from the original innate essence, which is then distributed. When the organs become full and overflow, they send it to the kidneys, which are the source of original vital energy—the root of generation, serving as the path for nourishment that begins and ends in transformation.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If the essence of food encounters a disease in a zang organ, then the taste and transformation of the food in that organ will be incomplete, and it cannot enter to be stored with the original essence; instead, it will be leaked out. As for the case where the spleen transfers heat to the kidney, resulting in pain in the lower abdomen and the emission of a white substance, the principle is the same. Although Wang&#39;s commentary states that it dissipates fat and burns flesh, might it not be the essence stored in the kidney that is being consumed? If both organs are disease-free, would this white substance not be the essence? If both organs are diseased, would not the stored essence transform into this white substance and be expelled? </p>
<p>Using this as a comparison, should the essence of the lungs and spleen not also be at risk of being lost due to the disturbance of the liver, leading to the essence being violated and leaking? Therefore, how should we treat this? The answer is: for leakage originating solely from the kidney, treat the kidney. If it is caused by issues in other organs leading to kidney leakage, then treat both. If it leaks from other organs, treat the primary organ in question, and one must carefully assess the four categories to seek treatment. </p>
<p>Generally, if the essence leaks from the heart, the blood vessels become empty and fail to regulate. If it leaks from the lungs, the skin and hair become dry and coarse, leading to shortness of breath and discomfort. If it leaks from the spleen, the complexion turns yellow, the flesh deteriorates, and the limbs become weak. If it leaks from the liver, the color turns greenish, leading to weakness in the muscles. If it leaks from the kidney, the complexion turns yellow-black, the marrow is depleted, and the bones become weak; this can also be discerned from the pulse. </p>
<p>Someone might ask about the principles of dreaming at night and engaging in intimate interactions. The answer is: &quot;The Inner Canon&quot; states that the kidneys govern water and receive the essence of the five zang organs and the six fu organs to store it. It also states that it governs the hidden and is the root of storage; it is where the essence resides. Furthermore, it mentions the crucial balance of yin and yang: if yang is strong but not dense, then yin energy will be cut off.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Yin and yang are secret yet balanced; when they are harmonized, the spirit is well-regulated. When yin and yang are separated, the essence and energy are void. It is said that yin and yang meet in the meeting point of the governing vessels at the energetic street. In the “Spiritual Pivot,” the chapter on the disturbance of dreams states: When the qi resides in the yin organ, dreams connect to the inner world. The yin organ is where the source vessels are linked, and the channels of the Foot Taiyin, Yangming, Shaoyin, and Jueyin all gather there, converging with the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians. Since Jueyin governs the vessels, all these vessels fall under its authority. The kidneys represent yin and store essence, while the liver represents yang and regulates the flow. The yin organ is the channel for releasing essence; therefore, when the yin of the kidney is deficient, essence cannot be stored, and when the yang of the liver is strong, energy cannot be anchored. If confronted by an external yin disturbance in this channel, it interacts with the excessive yang, causing essence to escape and leading to dreams. The so-called strong yang does not refer to the true yang of the organs, but rather the excess fire residing in the liver. Water is yin, and fire is yang; thus generally, fire is considered yang, but when specified, it can represent two aspects. If fire excessively persists, it will consume the true yang of the organs. The liver is where the soul resides; if the true yang of the organs is deficient, the wandering soul will transform, resulting in dreams, much like those who are ill with a deficiency of the liver experiencing frequent dreams of deceased individuals. When asked, &quot;As you say, does dream-related emission come from the liver and kidneys?&quot; the response is, &quot;Not necessarily. At the onset of illness, it can arise not from the kidneys or liver, but from deficiencies in the heart, lungs, spleen, or stomach.&quot;<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>It must be transmitted through the liver and kidneys before the essence can move. This is fundamentally based on a natural principle of mutual transmission. Why is this so? The essence of the sinews is connected to the chest and abdomen above, encircles the navel, and joins the transverse bone below. Therefore, the Inner Classic states that it is the meeting point of yin and yang, where qi converges, governing the binding of bones and facilitating mechanisms. All five viscera possess fire, and the fire that resides in the liver is particularly significant; if it is harmonized, it generates beneficial effects, but if it is not, it causes harm, notably more than other forms of fire. Thus, the vigorous liver qi in an average person fills the sinews and serves as the root of abundance. The yin organs, gathering at the sinews, are thus strong in function, all empowered by the essence of mutual fire. If they encounter the inward connection to yin qi, then the fires of the three burners—both internal and external—converge downward, opening up all the body&#39;s original realms, allowing the nourishing essence to gather in the yin organs and surge forth. Is this limited solely to what the kidneys store? It is said that when the qi retreats to the yin organs during dreaming, this qi is also the reverse qi from the yin parts of the body, similar to the inward qi, thus dreams can be seen as the essence escaping from the inward connection. If one continues to think excessively, and the essence has already retreated into the yin organs, then upon lying down, dreams manifest and leakage occurs. However, this dreaming arises due to the deficiency of true yang; thus, after the essence has discharged, its qi cannot be completely restored, leading to physical decline, unlike average people who can recover easily within a short time after inward connection. What should be the treatment method? If the illness arises from other viscera, then treat the initial symptoms of the illness as the root, while the liver and kidney as the points of reference. If the illness arises specifically within the liver and kidneys, then treat only the liver and kidneys.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>When yin and yang are separate and water and fire do not communicate, then it is the state of completion. When yin and yang do not support each other, they should be harmonized. If yang is deficient, one should supplement its energy; if yin is deficient, one should supplement its blood; if yang is strong, its fire should be drained. Fire can be treated properly or improperly, adjusted in quantity according to what is beneficial.</p>
<p>The classics say: Endless thoughts lead to unfulfilled desires, indulging in fantasies and excessive activities result in loosened tendons and cause issues like nocturnal emissions. The teachings of the ancients consist of five methods: </p>
<p>First, using cinnabar, magnetite, dragon bone, etc., to stabilize the wandering spirit—this includes secret elixirs like Hejian’s True Essence Pill and the Eight Immortals Pill. </p>
<p>Second, if thoughts coalesce into phlegm and confuse the heart’s pathways, then Scholar Xu recommends pills like Zhu Ling Wan to guide and eliminate phlegm. </p>
<p>Third, if thoughts harm Yin, using ancient pearl powder pills, sea gourd&#39;s large phoenix marrow pills, and Qingxin pills helps to reduce fire and nourish Yin—Danxi used sea clam powder, indigo, cyperus, yellow bract, and anemarrhena to achieve this. </p>
<p>Fourth, if thoughts harm Yang, ingredients like Qianfu deer antler, cistanche, and dodder seed can be used to replenish Yang. </p>
<p>Fifth, if both Yin and Yang are deficient, Danxi treats a thin person experiencing cloudy dreams by addressing heart deficiency using pearl powder pills and Dingzhi pills.</p>
<p>Great Master Zhi says: Nocturnal emissions should not be entirely considered as coldness; there can also be a heat in the meridians that leads to them.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>I once treated a man who, by night, experienced a warm sensation in his spine and nocturnal emissions. I prescribed pearl powder pills and Polyporus pills, which helped to stop the emissions. He ultimately took Purple Snow (a medicinal substance), and the heat in his spine was alleviated. Another man had a flooding pulse and warm waist with emissions; I used a pill of agarwood for him and prescribed Daohong San to treat the fire, resulting in recovery. From this, I understand that all emissions due to body heat are indeed heat-induced.</p>
<p>If these are caused by excessive mental strain, it is advisable to use Zhi Yuan pills and a decoction with lotus seeds, adding Wuweizi (Schisandra) for ingestion, alongside Ling Sha Dan. If it is from unfulfilled sexual desire, it is suitable to take Si Qi Decoction with white pills. In severe cases, merely hearing or seeing can lead to emissions, known as &quot;white lust;&quot; for this, use Miaoxiang San with Yuhua Bai Dan.</p>
<p>Initially, dealing with slippery emissions, I recommended Qingzhou Bai pills coated with cinnabar, which were very effective. If it turns out that the issue is excessive sexual desire, leading to deficiency in the lower source, with emissions being uncontrollable, one should take Zhengyuan Decoction adding oyster powder and meat of Cistanchus, each at half a qian (unit of weight), ingesting Yangqi Dan or Ling Sha Dan, while also using deer antler pills, yam pills, Dodder seeds pills, and Gu Yang pills or similar.</p>
<p>However, these medicines are very potent; if improperly used in excess, it will exhaust the yin essence, inflame the strong fire, deplete the marrow and flesh, leading to lasting illness. Users must be cautious!</p>
<p>The principle of the medical professional states: When treating those with persistent emissions due to true lack of control, using harsh medications to stop them is ineffective; instead, purging the heart fire is better. If purging heart fire cannot stop it, it is advisable to use upward-raising medicines, adding wind-expelling herbs to stabilize. None other can achieve this as it raises the qi upward and does not allow it to descend.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Dream Loss of Essence</strong></p>
<p>Treatment focuses on the kidney and liver. The classics say: &quot;The essence of yin and yang is that yang must be consolidated.&quot; If yang is strong but not consolidated, yin energy will be lost. When yin is balanced and yang is concealed, the spirit is well-regulated; when yin and yang are separated, essence and energy will be depleted. The &quot;strong yang&quot; referred to here is the fire of the liver and kidney; &quot;lost yin&quot; refers to the true yin stored in the kidney. The kidney is yin and is responsible for storing essence; the liver is yang and is responsible for dispersing. Therefore, if the kidney&#39;s yin is deficient, essence cannot be stored; if the liver&#39;s yang is strong, fire cannot be concealed. With fire that cannot be concealed, like essence that cannot be stored, there will be no dreams; if there are dreams, they will leak out. </p>
<p>Someone may ask: Why is it that there are many erotic dreams and not other types? The &quot;Spiritual Axis&quot; discusses the phenomenon of dreams induced by chaotic energy affecting yin energy, thus dreams connect internally. The yin organ is the channel for seminal leakage, it governs the genitals, and is related to the Spleen, Stomach, Lesser Yin, and Greater Yin veins, as well as the Conception, Governing, and Penetrating vessels. All these channels converge in the yin organ, where the fire is also located.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>When an ordinary person enters a room and becomes strongly influenced by the activities within, it is due to the inner fire intensifying their energy. If one does not connect with this inner aspect or combine with the yin energy, then their essence does not leak. However, once there is a connection with the inner nature and interaction with yin, the fires of the triple burner (san jiao) above and below will converge and descend, allowing the openings of the body&#39;s original source to fully activate. The nourishing essence will all flow toward the yin organs to be released, and thus the kidneys cannot retain it. </p>
<p>If such a person possesses strong original essence, then the influences of lust cannot disturb them; after prolonged engagement, they remain unspent, much less so in dreams. Even if the inner fire stirs and leads to nocturnal dreams, they still do not leak. This is called a person with balanced yin and yang, who experiences no illness. </p>
<p>Today, individuals are born with a fundamentally weak constitution, and compounded by excessive desires, their kidney yin becomes depleted and exhausted. When yin is deficient, the inner fire stirs; the fire connects upwards to the heart, where the sovereign fire reacts to external stimuli and moves. When it moves, the inner fire accumulates and follows along, and although it may not converge, the essence has already strayed from its position, becoming a guest within the yin organs. </p>
<p>During nighttime rest, when the inner fire, which should be conserved, encounters and connects with the internal energies, it combines with the yin energy. Consequently, one sleeps and immediately dreams, leading to dream-induced release.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>If the kidneys are not deficient, then there will be no nocturnal emissions or dreams. Therefore, in treating this condition, one must primarily focus on the kidneys and liver. Someone may ask: If there is Yin deficiency and the fire moves causing dreams and emissions, and one takes Danxi&#39;s nourishing Yin pills to nourish Yin and lower fire, yet follows the prescription without effect, why is that? The answer is that this does not grasp the true intention of Danxi&#39;s method of nourishing Yin. In fact, the first prescription in &quot;Danxi&#39;s Heart Method&quot; originally considers Kidney Qi pills as the primary remedy for nourishing Yin. Nowadays, some people misunderstand this by using Huanglian and Zhimu as the main ingredients, generally relying on prescriptions like Kanli pills to stabilize the foundation. All of these are cold and draining fire medicines; the bitter cold can severely drain fluids. The kidneys should be supported and not drained; how can this help nourish Yin? Only Xue Lizhai has elucidated what Danxi did not, specifically using Six Flavors Rehmannia to nourish the kidneys and treat nocturnal emissions, which has often proven effective. Even if there is upward fire, water can nourish wood; when water rises, the fire of wood will cease. If there is insufficiency in the spleen and stomach and damp heat flows downward, use the previous pills as the base, decoct and take to supplement central Qi and lift upward.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>When the heart is overly burdened, unable to govern its directives and instead allowing the fire of the kidneys to take charge, one should primarily use the Pill of Return while also incorporating Gui Pi Decoction. If the fire in the life gate is weak and the primordial essence is depleted, leading to an unregulated jade gate, one should urgently use the Eight Flavor Pill or the Golden Lock Correcting Yuan Pill to strengthen the true yang, ensuring it encompasses the true essence without leaking. This is the general approach. </p>
<p>For those like Zheng Lust, Uncle Lu, and Wu Zhao Mountain, they focus on the kidneys while also addressing the heart and spleen. However, there is a type where the kidneys are not deficient but the liver channel is rampant with damp heat, causing pain in the genital area, tightness in the tendons, itchiness or swelling, or an inability to contract effectively. If there are white substances resembling sperm that flow down with urination, this is a manifestation of hernia, treated with Long Dan Qi Liver Decoction. </p>
<p>Zhang Zihua stated: issues such as involuntary urination, urinary blockage, impotence, and slippery, white discharges are all forms of hernia in men. In contrast, if a woman experiences blood stagnation, absence of her monthly cycle, heat in the lower back and knees, heavy legs, dry throat, urinary obstruction, and lumps in the lower abdomen—whether fixed or movable, along with protrusion of the front genitalia and anal issues—these are all forms of hernia in women, though women refer to them as &quot;mass&quot; instead of hernia. </p>
<p>— From &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; by Zhang Jiebing during the Ming Dynasty.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Murkiness</h3>
<p>Murkiness can be distinguished into red and white types, and there is a differentiation between essence and fluid. Generally, the red is more associated with heat, while the white has both cold and heat present. Murkiness arising from essence moves in the heart and kidneys; murkiness arising from fluid indicates illness in the bladder, liver, and spleen. </p>
<p>In cases of red murkiness, there may be red-colored urine or blood-tainted urine. If fresh blood is observed, treatment should follow the blood condition guidelines under hematuria. If the urine is yellow-red, it generally indicates a heat-related condition, but it must be accompanied by pain or urgency; only then can it be treated as heat-related murkiness. In other cases, prolonged fatigue or illness, excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence can deplete true yin, or taking too much cooling medicine can lead to increased redness, decreased quantity, and absence of pain or urgency. This is due to deficiency of water and depletion of fluids and does not relate to red murkiness. The classics state: &quot;When the central qi is insufficient, urination and defecation are altered,&quot; indicating such cases. One should warm and tonify the lower yuan (source of vitality) to facilitate transformation of qi; the water must clear up by itself. It is crucial not to indiscriminately treat all yellow or red urine as a condition of fire.</p>
<p>White murkiness can also be found in urine, where the color is white like washed rice. Overconsumption of fatty, sweet, alcoholic, and spicy foods can lead to murkiness, stemming from internally generated damp-heat. Additionally, heat and dampness from the external environment, influenced by seasonal changes, can also cause murkiness, which is externally derived. However, internally generated cases are more common than those from external sources. In summary, there must be evidence of heat-related symptoms or pathways to diagnose as a fire condition; clearing out the heat will resolve murkiness in all cases.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>When there is turbidity in the essence, it is surely due to the misfiring of the mutual fire, where lust opposes the essence, causing the essence to stray from its position and unable to be contained. This leads to a continuous outflow, overflowing and moving towards the bladder, resulting in painful and cloudy urination, with both clarity and turbidity present, all due to heat. Over time, there may be a descent of spleen energy, where the earth fails to control moisture and the pathway of water is unclear; or the mutual fire may be extinguished, causing the heart and kidneys to be uncoordinated, leading to slippery essence that is not firm, resulting in persistent turbidity. These conditions indicate the absence of heat. For conditions with heat, one should differentiate and clear the heart and kidneys; for those without heat, one should seek to solidify and lift the spleen and kidneys. This encompasses the methods for treating turbidity. </p>
<p>Regarding the condition of painful urination, where small amounts of urine are painful and drip persistently, desiring to expel but unable to do so, and wishing to stop but cannot—that is a complication of turbidity. If this turbidity is temporary, it will eventually resolve, but if it persists over time, it becomes a syndrome of painful urination.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The symptoms can vary: some may flow like oily liquid, some may emerge like sand or stones causing unbearable pain, some may resemble tendons, and sometimes there may be bloody urine. There is indeed a difference between these symptoms of dysuria and turbidity. Therefore, Mr. Yan identified five types of dysuria: Qi, stone, blood, oily, and labor. Qi dysuria presents as a condition of frequent urination with lingering dribbles; stone dysuria causes pain in the urethra with urination resembling sand or stones that cannot be expelled quickly; oily dysuria manifests as urine that flows like oil; labor dysuria arises from fatigue and may cause pain radiating with qi disturbances; blood dysuria occurs with heat, and in severe cases, may lead to bloody urine. If the nasal tip appears yellow, this indicates difficulty in urination. Generally, these symptoms are caused by the failure of the heart and kidneys to communicate, leading to the accumulation of heat and toxins, or may stem from excessive drinking after labor, or consuming dry and hot foods, or emotional distress—this is what Mr. Yan has comprehensively explained. However, in the initial stages of dysuria, it is invariably due to intense heat without room for discernment. But if one has taken cold and cool remedies for a long time without improvement, or experiences persistent dysuria, with pain and frequent urges subsiding but oily discharge remaining like cloudy fluid, this indicates a sinking of the middle qi and an unstable vital gate. It is essential to assess the pulse and symptoms to discern whether there is heat or deficiency to avoid errors.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>For heat in the bladder, if the urine is very red and there is either pain or a burning sensation, it is essential to directly eliminate the heat. One should first use treatments like Chao Xin Decoction, Da Fen Qing Decoction, or Qi Zheng Powder. If urination is difficult and there is persistent heat and agitation, the most effective remedy is Luzhu Decoction. If accompanied by constipation, one should use Ba Zheng Powder. If there is slight heat or the intensity of the heat has diminished, one should consider modifying the Yi Yin Decoction or use Dao Chi Powder, Huo Fu Dan, or Qing Xin Lian Zi Decoction. If urination is difficult, use Qing Fei Decoction.</p>
<p>For white urine that appears like leftover rice water, it also relates to heat in the bladder&#39;s water pathway, so use Dao Chi Powder or Chao Xin Decoction to clear it. If there is no internal heat but white urine, it often results from dampness in diet, so one should use Xiao Fen Qing Decoction or Ling Zhu Er Chen Decoction, reducing the dried ginger to enhance the drying effect. Generally, dampness resides in the intestines and stomach, or in the bladder; one may use Er Chen Decoction or Ban Xia Pill as alternatives. If the bladder is unstable and the liquid is turbid, it relates to the depletion of essence, so one should use Mi Yuan Decoction or Shui Lu Er Xian Dan to stabilize it. If the turbidity is in the essence division, it must be due to reckless movement of the fire of passion, or it may be that essence is reversed, causing both essence and urine to be troubled.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>If the pain from the disorder is severe, it is advisable to use calming drinks and large quantities of clear drinks to first extinguish the fire, and then stabilize the essence and energy. After a while, if both the pain and the disorder have subsided but the essence and turbidity persist, one should use remedies like Ningxin Gu Shen and consider formulas such as Biyuan Decoction or Tusi Decoction, or Ginseng Pills and Dingzhi Pills. For heart deficiency, remedies like milky drinks should be used.</p>
<p>If the Mingmen is deficient and cold, causing yang energy to be unstable, the essence and turbidity will occasionally appear and be difficult to cure. One must then strengthen and nourish the Mingmen, using prescriptions like Yougui Pills, Yizhi Decoction, Shike An Shen Pills, or Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pills. If the deficiency is not severe but there is slight cold in the organs that is not contained, one should use Bixie Fenqing Drink.</p>
<p>The methods for treating painful urination are generally the same as for treating turbidity. For conditions involving heat, clearing is appropriate; for turbidity, draining is advisable; and for sinking conditions, uplifting is required; for deficiency, nourishment is needed; for instability of yang energy, warming and supporting the Mingmen should be emphasized. The previous methods are universally applicable, with no other techniques needed.</p>
<p>For blood in the urine, if it occurs in men, any painless blood during urination is classified as hematuria; blood that comes with pain is termed blood dysuria. These are merely indications of stagnant blood. The treatment methods are detailed in the section on blood conditions. However, for women, blood dysuria frequently arises from issues in the Chong and Ren meridians, which is quite different from men, and there are specific guidelines for women&#39;s conditions.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Night Emission</strong></p>
<p>Dream emission and slippery essence, all are ailments resulting from loss of essence. Although the symptoms vary, the underlying cause is the same. The onset of night emission is fundamentally a matter of the heart. The heart serves as the sovereign fire, while the kidney acts as the ministerial fire; when there is movement, the kidney must respond. Therefore, in young individuals with strong desires, whether due to delusive thoughts in the heart or misleading encounters externally, the sovereign fire is agitated above and the ministerial fire blazes below, thus water cannot be contained and essence leaks out. Initially, this leakage may not be taken seriously, but as it recurs two or three times, it gradually becomes unceasing. Eventually, if the essence channel becomes slippery, any slight contact may induce leakage, and one cannot restrain it. At this point, when essence is depleted, yin becomes deficient, and when yin is deficient, there is no vitality, leading to exhaustion and injury, approaching death. </p>
<p>Though the storage of essence resides in the kidneys, its governance lies with the heart; thus, the ebb and flow of essence is entirely at the heart&#39;s command. When a young person first begins to engage with worldly matters, and their essence channel is not yet established, if they value life, they must first cherish their essence. To cherish essence, calming the heart is essential. It is observed that clever and agile individuals often suffer from this ailment, while those who are simple and rustic tend to be free of it. What is the reason for this disparity? It is simply due to the movements and stillness of the heart. This is what young people should understand before falling ill. Once they are afflicted and seek recovery, they must prioritize maintaining a calm heart, and then adjust and regulate according to the symptoms, which will naturally lead to healing. If one is unaware of how to seek the root cause and relies solely on medicine and nourishment, expecting success, such hopes are faint indeed.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>There are nine signs of nocturnal emissions: </p>
<ol>
<li>If one dreams of changes in intimacy, this emission indicates the movement of the spirit, caused by the heart.</li>
<li>If one dreams of unfulfilled desires, this emission reflects the loss of position, caused by the kidneys.</li>
<li>If one experiences emissions due to labor or fatigue, this indicates an inability to withstand, resulting from the weakness of the liver and spleen energy.</li>
<li>If emissions occur due to excessive thinking or contemplation, this signifies insufficient central energy and a deficiency in the heart and spleen.</li>
<li>If emissions result from damp heat flowing downward or erratic fire in the body, this indicates unclear fire in the spleen and kidneys.</li>
<li>If one experiences emissions without apparent reason, this reflects a deficiency in the lower source, leading to instability in the lungs and kidneys.</li>
<li>If one is naturally deficient and experiences easy emissions, this suggests a thinness of the original vital energy (Yuan Qi).</li>
<li>If one has taken cold purgatives for a long time, leading to loss of the original yang and resulting in emissions, this is due to a mistake in medication.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>When a strong and vigorous man, due to prolonged abstinence, experiences a spilling over, this is known as a case of excessive fullness. All such cases are regarded as disorders of seminal emission. The heart governs the spirit, the lungs control qi, the spleen regulates dampness, the liver is responsible for the smooth flow, and the kidneys manage storage. Thus, for all these ailments, each of the five viscera has its role, and therefore the treatment should also seek the underlying cause accordingly. If one is simply overflowing, then what is expelled will naturally leave on its own, and what is generated will naturally come forth; there is no need for concern here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Emissions that occur during dreams are referred to as nocturnal emissions; those that occur without dreams are called involuntary emissions. Nocturnal emissions may be associated with emotions and heat, as well as deficiency and overflow. Some dreams arise from emotional stirrings. When emotions stir, one should calm the heart; when the essence stirs, one should strengthen the kidneys. Involuntary emissions are primarily due to an inability of kidney energy to retain essence. If the emissions are excessive and accompanied by pain, then this indicates a condition of either red or white turbidity. </p>
<p>Regarding the treatment.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The essence&#39;s smoothness leading to frequent dreams and loss is surely rooted in desirous thoughts, developed from lack of caution, accumulating gradually until it causes the kidney energy to become unstable. The best remedy is Ling Zhu Tu Si Pill; next are Xiao Tu Si Zi Pill and Jin Suo Si Xian Dan, which can also be chosen for use. </p>
<p>When the fire of the heart is not clear and the spirit wavers upwards, essence leaks downwards; if the fire is intense, it is advisable to first clear the heart fire using a decoction of the two yin herbs. If the fire is not too intense, it is best to start with Bai Zi Yang Xin Pill, Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, or similar herbs like Ren Shen Pill and Yuan Zhi Pill to nourish heart energy, and then use Ling Zhu Tu Si Pill to consolidate it. If the fire of mutual movement is easily stirred and the liver and kidneys harbor excessive heat leading to easy discharge, the use of Zhu Du Wan is the most suitable, or other essence-consolidating pills can be administered. However, one must assess the intensity of the fire; those needing purification should first clear the fire.</p>
<p>For those who are fatigued and easily lose essence when mentally taxed, it is essential to nourish the heart and spleen, avoiding the mistake of seeking to clear and lighten. The Shou Pi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction with a reduction of wood fragrant, or using Mi Yuan Decoction, are all appropriate. In cases where there is some stagnation in the energy aspect and the person cannot tolerate Qi or Zhu, using Tu Si Decoction is advisable, or swallowing Ling Zhu Tu Si Pill with Ren Shen Soup is also effective.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>In cases of congenital lack of vitality and unstable yang, where there is excessive leakage, the essence of the Mingmen (Gate of Life) should be regarded as the primary focus. Formulas like Left Return, Right Return, Six Flavors, Eight Flavors, Five Blessings Decoction, Solid Yin Decoction, and Cuscuta Decoction should be used appropriately. The Experience Secret True Pill may also be considered. For those experiencing damp heat flowing downward, with fire suppressing the yin leading to leakage, it is advisable to use the Four Ling Powder or formulas like Large and Small Fenqing Decoction. </p>
<p>If excessive consumption of cold and cooling medicines results in unstable yang, causing the essence passage to be slippery and leakage to be relentless, one should promptly warm and tonify the spleen and kidneys, using formulas like Five Gentleman Decoction, Longevity Spleen Decoction, Right Return Pill, Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill, or Jiajiaozi Pill. </p>
<p>For the treatment of nocturnal emissions: if there is excess heart fire, one should clear the heart and descend the fire; if there is excess ministerial fire, one should strengthen water and nourish yin; if there is sinking qi, one should elevate it; if there is slippery leakage, one should firm it; when damp heat superimposes, one should separate and resolve it; for vacuous cold leading to leakage, one should warm and tonify the lower origin; if both the original yang and essence are deficient, one should focus on nurturing the root. </p>
<p>Modern approaches to treating leakage often utilize Huangbai (phellodendron) and Zhimu (anemarrhena) as the main ingredients or specifically use formulas like Solid Root Pill and Kanli Pill, ignoring the inherently bitter and cold nature of these substances, which can significantly lead to downward sinking and leaking, especially in those with kidney deficiency. The kidneys should be supported and not drained; thus, how can such methods benefit the kidneys? Using such treatments for non-fire slippery leakage is merely detrimental to the kidneys.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo, Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Stone Lin</strong>  </p>
<p>When a person experiences painful urination with stones of five colors, the pain is intense before urination and slightly relieved after. This condition is known as Stone Lin. It can occur after water exposure or after exposure and then entering water. For treatment, use 3 taels each of Rehmannia, Cornelian cherry, and Alisma; 5 taels each of Poria, almond, Plantago seeds, and Ophiopogon; 1 tael of green salt, 2 taels of Dipsacus, 8 taels of Fox nut, and 3 qian of cinnamon, ground into powder. Form into honey pills, taking 1 tael with boiling water each morning and evening. Within ten days, one will surely be free from the suffering of urinary stones.  </p>
<p>This condition is particularly painful, with a powerful urge to urinate yet being unable to, and when one can urinate, it feels like being cut with a knife. Exhausting all strength to release a stone results in a clang when it hits the water, not dissolving because of the fire in the bladder. This is a different ailment. The stones can appear red, white, yellow, green, or black—this variety arises from the accumulation of water being boiled by fire.  </p>
<p>The effectiveness of this formula lies in not directly treating Stone Lin but rather replenishing the deficiency of kidney water. When water is sufficient, the fire will naturally diminish; when the fire fades, water will transform on its own. There is a profound principle here. If one treats the bladder directly, the qi cannot be released, so how can water be transformed?<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Ejaculation in Dreams</p>
<p>The condition of nocturnal emissions often arises in young men who are absorbed in reading, may be stimulated by sight, or may engage in battles of the mind after experiencing release. They may exert themselves in writing for temporary satisfaction, or experience restless nights that lead to indulgence in sensuality, ultimately resulting in overwhelming emotions and a restless spirit. Their self-discipline becomes nonexistent, and the vital gates remain unsealed, frequently causing trouble in youth. </p>
<p>Now, an effective remedy: take eight taels each of reishi (prepared), foxnut, white atractylodes, and Chinese yam; four taels each of cornelian cherry and roasted jujube seeds; three taels each of north five-flavor fruit, ophiopogon, poria, and plantago seeds; and one tael of balloon flower root, grind them into a powder, and form pills with honey. Take one tael daily with hot water, and the condition will be completely cured, preventing its recurrence. </p>
<p>This formula is remarkable for using prepared reishi and Chinese yam as the main ingredients, while employing prepared earth and cornelian cherry as assistants, directly nourishing the yin of the heart and kidneys, and additionally utilizing white atractylodes to bolster the waist. Thus, the essence will not leak externally. Moreover, since there are no definite methods to stop nocturnal emissions, stopping them actually leads to greater leakage.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>It is better to replenish one&#39;s vital energy than to merely recover after experiencing loss, as one will not be in a desperate situation. Why must one supplement the essence only after it is lost? If one does not close the gates of loss, then how can one ensure permanence without the aid of certain remedies? The roots of the plant provide relief to urination and preserve essence if one understands their proper function. </p>
<p>The evidence of nocturnal emissions, if prolonged, will leave the body&#39;s gates unsealed, leading to depletion and death. Often, people resort to stimulating medicines for the essence, which do not offer salvation. If one addresses the issue before it becomes severe, using medicines to replenish essence and energy, one would not reach such a state. </p>
<p>Take one tael each of Euryale seeds and Chinese yam, five qian of lotus seeds, three qian of fried jujube seeds, two qian of Poria, and one qian of ginseng, and decoct them in water for drinking. This formula is called the Preservation of Essence Decoction. After consuming the decoction, add five qian of white sugar, mix well, and consume along with the dregs daily. Do not stop for less than ten days. The flavors of the medicine are mild, yet its efficacy is profound: Euryale seeds and Chinese yam secure essence and nourish marrow, lotus seeds calm the heart and prevent dreams, Poria and jujube seeds settle the spirit and benefit the water, and ginseng operates in a non-interfering way. </p>
<p>There is no need to suppress dreams, for they will naturally cease; there is no need to stop the essence, for it will self-regulate. Why then should the gates remain open, leading to premature demise?<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p>The calamity of impurities arises from the imbalance of the heart and kidneys, water and fire. This can occur due to indulgence in wine and lust, leading to excess, which is referred to as soil indulgence. The heart has empty heat while the kidney is deficient, thus the soil evil affects the water. Historical records have mentioned that in summer, the soil is dry and the water is impure; in winter, the soil is firm and the water is clear—this is the principle behind it. Physicians often prescribe harsh tonics, but this can worsen the condition. This formula harmonizes and is taken to ensure that water and fire are balanced, and thus the soil becomes firm and the flow is clear.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ginseng: 2 taels</li>
<li>Dragon bone (calcined): 1 tael</li>
<li>White poria: 2 taels</li>

<p>For conditions of seminal emission that cannot be controlled, accompanied by spontaneous sweating, dizziness, extreme weakness, or alternating chills and fever, if tonic herbs are ineffective, and the pulse is floating, soft, and scattered, it is not merely deficiency, nor is it simply due to excessive indulgence in sexual activities. The cause is the heart&#39;s perceptions, leading to desire and joy in the mind, which stirs up intentions that do not align with one’s will, resulting in this illness. If the medicine does not work to replenish and strengthen, what else can be done? It is because when the heart has attachments, the spirit cannot return; when the mind has desires, the will cannot settle. </p>
<p>First, harmonize the Defensive and Nutritive Qi; when these are harmonious, the heart will be at peace. Next, regulate the Spleen; when the Spleen&#39;s energy is harmonious, the will can stabilize. When the heart and kidneys interact intimately, the spirit within guards itself, and the illness will heal naturally. </p>
<p>For this, use three qian of Ren Shen and one qian of Dang Gui, wash and fry them into powder, and make three doses mixed with glutinous rice drink. After taking this, spontaneous sweating will stop, and chill and heat will retreat. If dizziness persists, use three qian of Chuan Xiong and one qian of Ren Shen, fry into powder and make three doses mixed with boiling water. After taking this, dizziness will resolve. </p>
<p>For those with uncontrolled emissions, use half a tael of Bai Shao, and three qian each of Ding Xiang and Mu Xiang, ground to a fine powder. Each dose should be taken with five slices of fresh ginger and two dates, boiled together in water.

<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Canon&quot; states: For the method of nocturnal emission, at the hour of midnight, when yang energy is at its peak, lie on your back, close your eyes and mouth, place your tongue on the upper palate, arch your back, use the middle finger of your left hand to apply pressure on the coccyx point, and use the thumb of your right hand to press down on the base of your ring finger, forming a fist. Stretch both legs out fully, curl your toes inward, inhale deeply, and visualize the energy traveling from the spine to the back of the head, then reaching the crown of the head, and slowly descending down to the lower dantian. Only then can you gently lower your waist, legs, and hands, and proceed as before. If the yang energy has weakened, repeat this two or three times as you did initially. If the yang energy has not yet matured, it is acceptable to force it to rise. The reason people experience weakness is due to youthful desires being too strong, excessive sexual activity, and the imbalance between water and fire, leading to such ailments.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>If one can practice this method, not only will the disease of seminal leakage quickly be resolved, but over time the kidney essence will rise, and the heart fire will descend, thus balancing water and fire, leading to a state free from illness. </p>
<p>Additionally, the method for preventing involuntary seminal release involves using a short and narrow bed, lying in a bow-like position with both knees drawn toward the navel and choosing to sleep on either the left or right side. One should hold the scrotum with one hand and press the lower abdomen with the other, ensuring a calm and quiet state while avoiding thoughts of sexual desire. By preventing seminal leakage, one can preserve health.</p>
<p>Another method involves lying on one&#39;s side and, during the hours between dog and pig (between 7 PM and 9 AM), using one hand to support the external kidneys and employing both hands to rub the area below the navel eighty-one times, then switching hands, repeating nine times. This practice for nine days should yield results, with success seen by the eighty-first day.</p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: For white discharge and white belt disorders, apply gentle pressure on the kidney points and the Qihai point, performing this pinching and rubbing technique in sets of ninety-nine, while also performing subsequent practices.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br><strong>Exercise:</strong> Use both hands to hold both knees, inhale and exhale, focusing on the area below the navel. Raise the energy from the tailbone, then let it descend back; inhale and swallow it. </p>
<p>For clear discharge, hold both knees with both hands, inhale and exhale, concentrate on the navel while sitting. If practiced for a long time, it will cure ailments. This requires raising the energy before letting it descend, inhaling and swallowing it. There is a kind of agitation of the mind that must be calmed before proceeding. </p>
<p>Leukorrhea and dysentery share similar symptoms; urinary issues and leukorrhea follow the same method. Thus, failures to resolve these discharges lead to urinary issues; both are caused by energy stagnation and mental fatigue. </p>
<p><strong>Dreaming while directing essence exercise:</strong> Use a large neck pot, properly fitted with a strap on top, and place it on the male genitals, then sleep comfortably. If the male organ awakens every night, do not miss the moment. Quickly rise, warm your clothes, and perform thirty-six rhythmic movements to circulate through the limbs. By diligently practicing in this manner, one will have no worries forever.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>To practice energy cultivation, one must often remain still, focusing the mind on the navel without allowing it to relax. Then, visualize a stream under the bladder, with the tailbone dividing into two paths leading to the kidneys, moving the energy from left to right through the navel. When lying down, rub the soles of the feet and the kidney acupoints, bending one foot and lying on your side; this will help preserve essence.</p>
<p>For external methods: Sit cross-legged at midnight, first rub the soles of your feet, then massage the kidney acupoints, calming the spirit and mind. Rest your head on a pillow, tuck your feet in while lying down; this will prevent essence from being lost.</p>
<p>When urinating, step with the right foot onto the left side of the foot, facing the right shoulder three times, and after finishing, turn to face the left shoulder three times. If one feels an urge, focus on the navel and contract the lower abdomen; this will help retain essence.</p>
<p>For methods involving spontaneous sweating, night sweats, and nocturnal emissions: Begin by focusing on the navel, visualizing internal fire rotating. Use your hand to cover the navel while concentrating; then visualize a stream below the navel, under the bladder, up to the tailbone, and through the back exiting at the heart, cleansing it; if not due to nocturnal emissions, do not use the method of directing the stream below the navel.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rituals of Serving Parents&quot; states: A man from Dai passed through Xi City, where a young man suffered from schistosomiasis. The man from Dai instructed him to eat salted fish, and soon he became very thirsty; then the man from Dai allowed him to drink as much water as he wanted, and afterward treated the schistosomiasis with medicine, which immediately relieved his symptoms. The patient experienced difficulty with urination, hence the condition worsened.</p>
<p>The son of a liquor monitor, a kind-hearted boy of thirteen, had been suffering from sand-stone schistosomiasis for nine years. Initially, due to residual toxins from a rash, he experienced bloody stools. Someone advised him to take Taibai Powder, which provided some relief. However, due to the accumulation of heat that did not subside, he developed a blockage, which caused him to hallucinate, crying out and alarming the neighbors. </p>
<p>The man from Dai diagnosed him, concluding that previous physicians incorrectly attributed the illness to the kidneys and small intestines. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that the Liver channel of the Foot Jueyin relates to issues with urination and blockages. A blockage refers to the inability to urinate, while schistosomiasis is a kind of dripping. This is a disease related to the Wood element, not the small intestine nor the kidneys. The Wood element is suppressed, and Fire comes to overtake it, leading to heat accumulation in the bladder, which constricts and forms sand and stones, similar to a cooking pot simmering for an extended period, turning the water into alkaline residue. </p>
<p>As for the bladder of sheep and pigs, when inflated with air, it cannot release anything; how can there truly be sand and stones that can leak? Thus, it is understood that what previous physicians described about taking Wushi Pills to resolve the issue may not be completely accurate. The classic text states: When Wood is obstructed, it must be addressed first with Gua Ti Powder to unblock it, and then followed by Ba Zheng Powder mixed with alkaline water in equal parts, to be consumed in sips, allowing the sand and stones to dissolve and pass.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The young boy of the Zhang family from Qucun is fourteen years old and has been ill for about a year and a half. The illness began in the wheat harvest season, manifesting as severe abdominal pain with spasms, leading him to grip his abdomen, jump, twist, and cry out without ceasing. He experienced a few days of difficulty urinating, only managing to do so in small amounts resembling sand and stones, while his bowel movements were severely constipated, causing his rectum to protrude one to two inches. Many doctors were unable to cure him, so he was carried by his father to seek the help of a healer. The healer stated: &quot;Today&#39;s treatment will yield results today.&quot; It was around the hour of Chen and Si. </p>
<p>Using a formula to regulate the stomach and relieve heat, with a mere one or two taels, he added three qian of cowherb root powder, boiled it in river water, and instructed him to swallow it three to five times. He also took a bitter powder in the form of sixty tiny pills the size of mustard seeds. After these treatments, he experienced a rush of vomiting and diarrhea all at once, with pus and blood expelled. Once the purging settled, he was instructed to drink a large bowl of freshly drawn water, which immediately aided his urination one or two times. That night, he drank fresh water twenty to thirty times, and nearly all of his illness was alleviated, with only one instance of crying remaining. </p>
<p>The next day, he lay down as if drunk, from morning until dusk, and suddenly got up to run about, seeking food, laughing and singing with his mother, finally free from his suffering. He then followed this with prescriptions like Taibai powder and Bazheng powder, adjusting his treatment over one day, leading to a complete recovery. Concerned that he might lose the nourishment during the hot weather, he returned after five days. The healer remarked: &quot;This was a blockage in the lower yang. If there was no vomiting or bowel movement, how could the lower yang be opened? If one does not drink water, how can urination improve? Generally speaking, if the source is clean, then the flow will be clear.&quot;<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>The son of Liu Shisan from Bai Ting, aged six, suffered from a disease called sandstone strangury. A healer administered three purgations using a bitter medicine and three doses of a kidney-expelling powder, and he was immediately cured. </p>
<p>In Luyi, a family with a son aged twenty-three had been afflicted by thick strangury for three years. Local doctors were unable to treat him, and he had visited the capital city seeking help, but most remedies had only weakened him. They supplemented his treatment with warming and drying methods, and employed needling and moxibustion, but to no avail. The healer said: &quot;This is a case of sorcery sickness, also known as white lewdness. It is actually caused by heat in the lower abdomen, not by deficiency. It can be treated by purging to release the pressure.&quot; </p>
<p>The patient, fearing the severity of the method in the summer heat, hesitated for three days before deciding. A monk remarked: &quot;I, too, have felt head pain from the summer heat.&quot; The healer replied: &quot;You can also be purged of this; do not be afraid!&quot; Consequently, three pints of phlegm were expelled, dark like alum juice, containing stagnant blood along with yellow-green water, followed by several bowel movements of foul accumulation, after which he felt his illness had vanished. </p>
<p>When he arrived, his face was pale, but by the next day after the treatment, his complexion resembled that of someone intoxicated. Concerned for the long journey during the hot month, the healer provided the necessary remedies for him to prepare for his return.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A man has been sluggish for years, occasionally experiencing nocturnal emissions, appearing emaciated, feeling a deficiency in spirit.

White Atractylodes nourishes the stomach, which is all about active method. After taking four doses, the turbidity reduces by more than half, but she feels a fullness in the chest. Due to Bupleurum and Angelica lifting the stomach qi, phlegm blocks and causes fullness. Again, use the original decoction, adding fried malt, White Atractylodes, and Cyperus, and she will recover. If there is no phlegm present, even with lifting, fullness will not occur.</p>
<p>Zhen Guard of Ten Thousand Households, Xiao Boshan, has been sluggish, and his essence is not retained. Various remedies are ineffective, so he tries the inverted warehouse method for relief.</p>
<p>Zhu Lang has painful urination with a pulse that is strong on the left side and weak on the right. This indicates exhaustion has harmed the menstrual blood. Do not treat it as a urinary issue; rather, boost the blood and move the stagnant blood in the liver channel for self-recovery. Use raw Rehmannia, Angelica, Red Peony, and Achyranthes, each one penny; Chuanxiong, dried Scutellaria, and Licorice tips, each three-fifths; Chenpi, Muxiang, and Peach kernel, each five-fifths; and stir-fried Huanglian, two-fifths processed. Grind the Peach kernel into a paste and cook with talcum. Once the urinary condition alleviates, remove the talcum, Achyranthes, and Muxiang, and replace Muxiang with Chuan Niu Xi, double the dose for recovery.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>&quot;The Treasure of Hygiene&quot; states: In the year of Jisi, during the summer months in the Upper Capital, the Grand Guardian Liu Zhonghui summoned Shijia Ruming and reported, &quot;Recently, several companions have had a condition resembling dysuria. Is this due to climatic changes or the terrain?&quot; I thought to myself, there are no other ailments here, and this disease solely affects you, which is likely not caused by climate or terrain. I then asked Ruming, &quot;Have you been eating anything unusual lately?&quot; He replied, &quot;The envoy presented over a hundred pairs of papayas, which I have been cooking with honey, serving them to guests three to five times a day.&quot; I said, &quot;This is the cause of your dysuria.&quot; The Inner Canon states: &quot;Excessive consumption of sour foods can lead to urinary problems.&quot; You can inform the Grand Guardian and restrict his intake. </p>
<p>One day, the Grand Guardian asked me, &quot;How does sour flavor lead to dysuria?&quot; I replied, &quot;The essence of urination is governed by Qi.&quot; The Needle Canon states: &quot;Sour food enters the stomach, causing Qi to become thick and retained, unable to circulate between the upper and lower burners.&quot; If it does not exit, it remains in the stomach; if the stomach is harmonious and warm, it descends to the bladder, whose membranes become thin and weak, contracting in response to sourness, thereby blocking flow, resulting in dysuria. Furthermore, it states: &quot;The generation of Yin is fundamentally linked to the Five Flavors; the injury to Yin organs is also linked to the Five Flavors.&quot; The body&#39;s desire for the Five Flavors must be moderated; one should not indulge excessively. Overindulgence in flavors can injure their essence; isn&#39;t that true for sour flavor as well? The Grand Guardian sighed, saying, &quot;As a person, one cannot be ignorant of medicine.&quot; How true!<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>In the third year of the Zhongtong era, in the middle of June, Huang Ming experienced painful urination, with unbearable pain in the penis and pain radiating to the side. After following a prescribed method, he found great relief. The prescription included five fen of ginseng, four fen of peeled poria, one qian each of wild orange seed (pitted, shredded, and roasted) and licorice, seven fen of curcuma, and three fen each of alisma, bupleurum, the tops of angelica, and amber. These ingredients were to be ground and made into a single dose, boiled with three bowls of water until reduced to one bowl, then the dregs were filtered out and the liquid was consumed warm on an empty stomach before meals, resulting in improvement.</p>
<p>The &quot;Zheng Chuan of Medicine&quot; states: In Lantang, Zhu Xian suffered from spontaneous seminal emission and tidal heat for three months without getting out of bed. He called upon me for treatment. The pulse on both sides at the cun position was floating, empty, and weak, while the pulse at both chi positions was strong but soft. I prescribed a modified version of the &quot;Baizhong Yiqi Decoction,&quot; adding cooked rehmannia, anemarrhena, coptis, and lycium bark, and suggested taking pearl powder in pill form. Additionally, an external small bamboo cage was made to encase the penis, avoiding contact with flesh. After taking medicine for over thirty doses, he was well within a month.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: A man with a strong pulse, experiencing hot lower back and seminal emissions, should take Shenchang Hezhong Pill to help. Daohong San can treat the fire and lead to recovery. From this, we understand that anyone experiencing heat-related emissions is suffering from a heat disorder.</p>
<p>A young man who has nocturnal emissions with a creamy discharge feels a rush of gas in his lower abdomen. He experiences daily heat in the lower back, with cold hands and feet when the heat arises. When the heat subsides, his hands and feet feel warm. If he frequently suffers from gas and belching, and experiences recurrent emissions every ten days or so, his pulse will be strong and slippery. I recognize that he has stagnation. First, I prescribed the Shenchang Hezhong Pill in a strong dose. Then, I used a modified version of the Eight Medicinal Herbs Decoction, taking it with 100 pills of Zishen Wan. If he took this with slightly stronger herbs like clam powder, the emissions and discharge would worsen, with potentially two emissions in a night. Thus, I switched to a large dosage of Daohong San boiled into a decoction for him to take, stopping both the emissions and discharge gradually.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man experiencing nocturnal emissions had been given strong herbs and continued to have emissions for several nights. I foolishly started with Shenqiong Wan in a large dose to expel the symptoms, but then opted for a recipe for Zhu Ling Wan. Both resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>A young man suffering from nocturnal emissions experienced one every forty to fifty days. Despite using Fengsui Dan and Hejian Mizhen Wan, there was little effect, and the issue did not resolve. Later, I switched to a formula with Acorus, Polygala, Chive Seeds, Silkworm, Euryale Seeds, Sour Jujube Seeds, Oyster Shell, Dragon Bone, and Morinda, made into pills, and he was successfully cured.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>A middle-aged man experienced nocturnal emissions, and took pearl powder pills and other medications, but with no effect. He then used remedies with Gentiana and Acorus, and recovered quickly.</p>
<p>Wang Yuangui had weakness and excessive seminal discharge, with a strong, wiry pulse. After repeatedly taking variations of the Eight Herbs Decoction along with Hejian&#39;s Secret True Pill and pearl powder pills, his condition did not improve. Later, he took one liang of gall nut and two liang of poria in pill form, which cured him. This demonstrates the effectiveness of gall nut in treating discharges, particularly when combined with dragon bone and oyster shell.</p>
<p>&quot;The Essential Reads of Medicine&quot; states: The county magistrate Yan suffered from chronic painful urination, feeling as if stabbed by knives. Despite taking three hundred prescriptions aimed to clear heat and promote urination, his condition worsened. When he came for a consultation at year’s end, I noted that his pulse was weak and measured two inches; this indicated excess internal heat caused by deficiency. Traditionally, doctors focused solely on alleviating pain, which led to deeper deficiency—the more they cleared, the more deficiency they induced, resulting in intensified internal heat.</p>
<p>I then prescribed Bawei Dihuang Pills along with treatments like Plantago, agarwood, and ginseng in eight doses. The pain reduced slightly, yet it remained frequent. A former physician suggested that the painful urination stemmed from true internal heat, warning that excessive warming could risk his health severely in days to come. Unless he expressed doubts, we could discuss further. I responded: &quot;If warming isn&#39;t advisable, then after taking the medicine, his condition must worsen. Now it has already lessened, what more is there to doubt?&quot;</p>
<p>He took Buzhong Yiqi Decoction in the morning and Bawei Pills in the evening, and after a month, nine-tenths of his illness had vanished. He then doubled the use of ginseng and astragalus, and in fourteen days, he was completely recovered.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>The great official, Du Wan, had a wife who suffered for two years, trying all remedies without any effect. Upon examining her, I observed that her legs were swollen and heavy, indicating stagnant blood. The treatment should aim to reduce this. However, due to her old age, I was cautious and didn’t dare to use aggressive methods. Instead, I added amber and ox knee to supplements for nourishing her qi and blood. Such gentle remedies typically require numerous doses to be effective, but the lady was impatient for quick results. When the second dose proved ineffective, she wished to change treatments, leading to a stubborn illness.</p>
<p>A scholar faced difficulties in the civil service examination at Nandu. After returning, he experienced involuntary release of fluid during urination and in dreams, which persisted despite taking plum kernel syrup for a month with no results. He sought treatment from me. I said, “Your qi is deficient and your spirit is unsettled; the only remedy is the Yuan Zhi pill.” After taking it for ten days, his condition improved by half, and he was completely healed in a month.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>Zhang Ning, a martial scholar, possessed a strong constitution but drank excessively. Suddenly, he noticed some white droplets after urination and believed himself to be suffering from a deficiency, refusing treatment. For three months, though he did not urinate, he often experienced emissions, feeling dizziness in his head. The physician treated him with tonics to consolidate essence and stop leakage for two months, with little effect. When I examined him, I found his six pulses to be slippery and swollen. This was due to the damp heat from alcohol depleting his essence. Therefore, I prescribed a mixture of Atractylodes, Poria, Tangerine peel, Licorice, Kudzu root, and White Cardamom, with a small amount of Berberine. After two doses, he showed improvement; within ten days, he recovered to normal.</p>
<p>Scholar Qian Yongbin had excessive desire and experienced nocturnal emissions. He first took a clearing fire tonic, which was ineffective, and then astringent tonics, which also yielded no results, leading him to seek my treatment. I prescribed a strong decoction of Ginseng with two qian, and after two doses, he felt slightly more solid. I also added Six-Ingredient Rejuvenation Pills, along with lotus stamen, fox nut, Polygala, and Schisandra. After a month, he was cured.</p>
<p>Minister Wu Boyu, who repressed his essence while engaging in intimacy and sometimes encountered strain from writing, suffered from a white discharge and pain in his genitals as if cut by a knife. He first took a clearing fire tonic, which failed, and then switched to a kidney tonic that also proved ineffective, leading him to request my treatment. I observed that long-term leakage of essence was already harmful, especially combined with mental strain, where water and fire did not blend harmoniously. I used a decoction with Rhizoma Dioscoreae to clear dampness, along with Poria, Polygala, Cinnamon, and Coptis. After four doses, he showed improvement; I later prescribed Revitalize the Spleen and Boost Qi pills, along with Six-Ingredient Rejuvenation Pills. After half a month, he was stable. However, due to overwork, it recurred, but he quickly recovered after taking one or two doses of the Revitalize the Spleen and Boost Qi pills.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>The Duke of Guidé, Li Yizhai, suffered from leucorrhea and took several doses of Wuling San without effect. Upon examination, I found the condition to be significant and persistent, indicative of a deficiency due to dragon fire. Consequently, I used Niu Xi, Fuling, Huangbai, Maidong, Shanyao, Yuanzhi, Xixin, and Gan Cao, and after ten doses, he was stable.</p>
<p>In the medical records of Xue Ji, it is stated: the young official Wang Hanzhai experienced leucorrhea. I prescribed a formula to tonify the spleen and benefit Qi, adding Fuling and Banxia, and he recovered. However, he later developed back pain, which was treated with Shanyao, Shanzhuyu, Wuweizi, Bixie, and Yuanzhi, resulting in a quick recovery. He then experienced mental fatigue and nocturnal sweating with leucorrhea, which was resolved using Guipi Decoction with Wuweizi. Afterward, he occasionally felt dizzy and was completely cured with Bawei Wan.</p>
<p>One man, who habitually experienced seminal emission, also suffered heel pain, dryness of the mouth, thirst, and constipation in the afternoon. He was treated with a formula to tonify the spleen and benefit Qi, adding Shaoyao and Yuanshen, along with Liuwuwei Wan, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Minister Chen Shijing had long suffered from leucorrhea and experienced heat and fatigue. I used the formula to tonify the spleen and benefit Qi, adding roasted ginger in four doses, which slightly alleviated the leucorrhea. He then took Liuwuwei Dihuang decoction, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>The Minister Chai Fu’an, due to fatigue, suffered from red and white leucorrhea and used Jisheng Guipi and Shiquan Dabu formulas alternately, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Minister Zhang Jianzhai had swelling and pain in the scrotum, experiencing chills and fever, and upon lower abdominal pain, he had a discharge of white fluid. He was treated with Xiaochaihu Decoction and additional herbs including Zhizi, Dancao, Chuanxiong, and Gui, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>Zhu Gongbu, through excessive labor, experienced seminal emissions and tooth pain. To remedy this, he took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Ban Xia, Fu Ling, and Shao Yao, gradually improving; he then added Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, with Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A man suffering from nocturnal emissions with a cloudy discharge experienced dry mouth and severe constipation in the afternoon heat. He took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Shao Yao and Yuan Shen, and added a modified Ba Wei Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A candidate, Chen Luxian, had excessive desires and experienced fever without respite in the winter of Ding You. He continually drank water and suffered from constant seminal emissions and dripping urination. Initial treatments with Si Wu and Qin Lian made matters worse, leading to phlegm rising and sores on the mouth and tongue. After taking Er Chen and Huang Bo, he faced chest discomfort and reduced appetite; when he added Zhi Ke and Xiang Fu, he experienced abdominal distension, loose stools, and a floating pulse that was weak upon pressure. </p>
<p>In the morning, I prescribed Si Jun Zi Tang as the primary formula, supplemented with Shu Di and Dang Gui, and at night, added a modified Ba Wei Wan. I further used Fu Zhi to rub and stimulate the Yong Quan acupoint, leading to gradual improvement. Later, I prescribed Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, but due to constipation and abdominal distension—in connection with rectal dryness—I advised the use of pig bile to alleviate this; he also felt exceptionally fatigued, and phlegm-heat surged. An urgent application of Du Shen Tang stabilized the condition, followed by a decoction that helped with recovery. However, he continued to have fever without specified times, with a floating, surging pulse, which I warned him to be cautious with his lifestyle to avoid further complications. He dismissed my advice as overly cautious, and in the summer of Yi Si, relapsed, ultimately passing after taking Si Wu, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>A man experienced little appetite, a feeling of fullness in the chest, coldness in his hands and feet, and was sensitive to cold, leading to heat, phlegm, and occasional nausea. He used clear qi to resolve phlegm and remedies like Erchen and bitter orange, which resulted in further chest and abdominal distension, vomiting phlegm and food, and dribbling urination; his condition worsened with the addition of formulas like Siling, Lian, Baike, Zhimu, and Cheqian, leading to difficulties in urination. I said: This is a case of spleen and stomach deficiency with cold and no fire, hence food does not digest and is expelled instead. Therefore, I employed the Eight Flavor Pill to tonify fire to generate earth, and supplemented with Ren Shen and Ginger, Cinnamon to invigorate the center, promoting yang energy, and he soon recovered.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>Sima Li had pain in his kidney area, with urination resembling dribbling, dry mouth, and phlegm. This was thought to be due to the essence being depleted and internal decline. He used tonics to replenish and support energy, and after using Six Flavor Rehmannia Decoction, he recovered. </p>
<p>Xiaobao Gu Ren, at sixty-one years of age, experienced a slippery discharge after diarrhea, which lasted for two days. After engaging in sexual activity, he felt cold and angry, resulting in chills and fever. He suffered from right flank pain radiating to his chest, abdominal distention, spontaneous sweating, and coldness in his limbs. He experienced nightmares and a sensation of floating or sinking, which led to sleeplessness. He took two doses of tonic, but his condition worsened, and his pulse was floating, large, rapid, yet weak upon pressure. This indicated a deficiency of fire and false heat, so he was quickly given a dose of Complete Nourishment Decoction with added Chinese yam, Chinese schizandra, peony root, and aconite, and all symptoms improved significantly and he recovered. Such vitality is rare.</p>
<p>A scholar experienced dry mouth and fever, frequent turbid urination, constipation, and night sweats with nocturnal emissions, leading to insomnia. He took two doses of Angelica Six Yellow Decoction, which stopped the night sweats; then used Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill to harmonize the two forms of elimination; and combined with Complete Nourishment Decoction and previous pills, he was fully cured in over a month.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: Zheng Xian&#39;s son, at the age of sixteen, developed a disease resembling dysuria seven months after birth. He experienced painful attacks every five to seven days, with urine resembling lacquer and millet. The pulse was light but choppy, heavy but wiry; he appeared emaciated and long, with a blue and sallow complexion. It was believed this was due to his father taking hot medicine, which left residual heat in the womb and affected the son&#39;s life gate. Thus, a remedy was prepared using purple snow mixed with yellow bile powder, formed into pills the size of wutong seeds, dried, and taken with hot soup—first a hundred pills, and after half a day, another two hundred. Food was pressed down on them. After another half day, intense pain spread from the waist to the abdomen; the urine then flowed, appearing like lacquer and millet, filling a bowl, and the pain reduced by eight-tenths. He was later given an ounce of dried tangerine peel, half an ounce each of Platycodon and Akebia, followed by a dosage of about a handful, which brought stability. If the father suffered from dryness and heat yet could affect the child, what could be said of the mother who was afflicted?</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Connection&quot; mentions: I treated Zheng Lushu, over twenty years old, who was studying for the imperial examination. He could not sleep through the fourth watch and fell ill. While in bed, his penis touched the quilt and leg, leading him to dream of sexual relations and losing semen; when it was suspended in the air, he did not dream. His appetite decreased daily, and he felt fatigued and breathless. This was due to excessive mental strain; both fire elements became heightened, preventing sleep at night, blood could not return to the liver, and kidney water was insufficient. The fire consumed the yin, thereby intruding into the lower region and disturbing the storage of essence, causing it to flee. The contact with the quilt further obstructed his vital energy, leading to dreams of intimacy. Consequently, I boosted the heart to calm the spirit, adjusted the spleen and stomach to raise yang, and applied tonics to nourish essence, generate yin, and consolidate yang. In less than three months, he returned to good health.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>In the past, there was a practitioner in Wu Zhao Mountain who understood the method for treating nocturnal emissions. He treated a man who, after becoming ill, overworked his mind and thus developed the problem of dreaming of emissions. The man was thin and phlegmatic, and various doctors prescribed a cleansing heart with lotus seed drink, which was ineffective over time. Upon diagnosing his pulse as tight and rough, I realized that the use of cold and diuretic medicine was excessive, resulting in the decline of kidney energy, which would worsen his condition. I employed a method of elevation, raising the water of Kan to assist the fire of Li, reducing Yang energy while nourishing Yin blood. Then, I used deer antler glue and human milk to replenish essence and blood. In less than a month, he was cured. </p>
<p>I reflected on the multiple causes of nocturnal emissions, which make treatment difficult. Some are caused by excessive mental heat leading to leakage, while others result from overconsumption of cold diuretic medicines like Ophiopogon, Poria, Plantago, Anemarrhena, and Coptis, which also lead to leakage. There are also cases of prolonged leakage without closure at the Yumen (Jade Gate). For treatment, those with excessive heat should clear the heart and diminish fire; those affected by cold and diuretic medicines should warm and tonify the lower origin; and those with declining kidney energy should elevate and retrieve energy, allowing the water and fire to interact so that Kan and Li can stabilize naturally.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《难经》云：病有关有格。关则不得小便。又云：关，无出之谓，皆邪热为病也。分在气在血而治之，以渴与不渴而辨之。如渴而小便不利者，是热在上焦肺之分，故渴而小便不利也。夫小便者，是足太阳膀胱经所主也，长生于申，申者西方金也。肺合生水，若肺中有热，不能生水，是绝其水之源。经云：虚则补其母。宜清肺而滋其化源也。故当从肺之分，助其秋令，水自生焉。又如雨如露如霜，皆从天而降下也，乃阳中之阴，明秋气自天而降下也。且药有气之薄者，乃阳中之阴，是感秋清肃杀之气而生，可以补肺之不足，淡味渗泄之药是也。茯苓、泽泻、琥珀、灯心、通草、车前子、木通、瞿麦、篇蓄之类，以清肺之气，泄其火，资水之上源也。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>如不渴而小便不通者，热在下焦血分，故不渴而大燥，小便不通也。热闭于下焦者，肾与膀胱也。乃阴中之阴，阴受热，邪闭塞其上流，易老云，寒在胸中，遏绝不入；热在下焦，填塞不便。须用感北方寒水之化，气味俱阴之药，以除其热，泄其闭塞。《内经》云：无阳则阴无以生，无阴则阳无以化。若服淡渗之药，其性乃阳中之阴，非纯阳之剂，阳无以化，何能补重阴之不足也？须用感地之水运而生太苦之味，感天之寒药而生大寒之气，此气味俱阴，乃阴中之阴也。大寒之气，人禀之生膀胱；寒水之运，人感之生肾。此药能补肾与膀胱。受阳中之阳，热火之邪，而闭其下焦，使小便不通也。夫用大苦寒之药，治法当寒因热用。又云必伏其所主而先其所因，其始则气同，其终则气异也。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　　　丹溪心法 【元　朱震亨】</p>

<p>　　丹溪书分梦遗、精滑为二门。盖梦与鬼交为梦遗，不因梦感而自遗者为精滑，然总之为遗精也。其治法无二，故合之。　　或问精滑何因得之？曰：《金匮要略》谓虚劳之病，脉浮大，手足烦，阴寒精自出。又谓脉弦而大，此名革，亡血失精。又谓小腹弦急，阴头寒，脉动微紧，男子失精，女子梦交。通巢氏《病源》以虚劳病分出五劳、七伤、六极、二十三蒸之名，于七伤中精连连精连连：原作「精连」，据《诸病源候论》虚劳候改。，蒸病中玉房蒸，男则遗沥漏精，与尿精、闻见精出，及失精等候皆混同，仍类虚劳门。为肾主藏精，故尽作肾气衰弱之病，似若他脏无损焉。岂其然哉？夫五脏皆藏精者也。尝考《灵枢》本神篇，首谓天之在我者德也。地之在我者气也，德流气薄而生者也。故生之来谓之精，两精相搏谓之神。如是者通言主一身主宰之精神也。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>因心肾是水火之脏，法天地施化生成之道，故藏精神为五脏之宗主。其次言所以任物者谓之心，心有所忆谓之意，意有所存谓之志，因志而存变谓之思，因思而远慕谓之虑，因虑而处物谓之智。如是者皆因心神随物所感变而分之，是谓五志，遂有五神脏之名。五神既分，则于德化、政令、性味，各司其属者之用，于是心肾之水火，亦俯从五神之列。然而所主之精神则并行，未始相离，而五神五变者，分之如此，则精亦从神之所变，随处与之合矣。故五脏各得藏其精神以行其用，是之谓脏真。主所以属本气之生化者也。苟有一脏之真不得其正，则一脏之病作矣。苟一脏之精神伤之甚者，则必害其心肾之主精神者也。如所谓怵惕思虑则伤神，神伤则恐惧，流淫而不止；喜乐恐惧则伤精，精伤则骨酸痿厥而不举；喜乐者惮散而不藏，恐惧者荡惮而不收。是故主藏精者不可伤，伤则失守而阴虚，阴虚则无气，无气则死矣。<a id="orig-51p" href="#trans-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>如是者精神之在五脏，伤之则淫邪立至。心之在志为喜，在气为火为热；肾之在志为恐，在气为水为寒。于是怵惕思虑伤其神，神伤则火动不止，火动不止则肾水恐惧之志者并矣。恐，其不解则动中而肾自伤，肾主藏精，与所受五脏六腑所输至之精皆不得藏而时自下矣。此乃以心肾主宰精神者言也。至若他脏之精各得而泄，有所据乎？曰：《内经》所谓思想无穷，所愿不得，意淫于外，入房太甚，宗筋弛纵，发为白淫，其病筋痿。筋痿者，生于肝使内也。王注以白淫是白物淫衍如精之状，因溲而下。虽云如精，殆非将化未成之精而径出者乎？何以言之？精有谓生来之精者，先身生之精也；有谓食气入胃，散精于五脏者，有谓水饮自脾肺，输肾而四布，五经并行之精者，此水谷日生之精也。然饮食日生之精，皆从生来元精之所化，而后分布，其脏盈溢则输之于肾，肾乃元气之本，生成之根，以始终化之养之之道也。<a id="orig-52p" href="#trans-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>若饮食之精遇一脏有邪，则其脏之食味化之不全，不得入与元精俱藏而竟泄出，与夫所谓脾移热于肾，少腹冤热而痛出白者，义亦如之。王注虽谓消脂烁肉，无乃消其肾所藏之精欤？盖使二脏无病，则此白物其不为精乎？使二脏有病，则所藏之精其不变为白物而出之乎？以此比例，则肺脾二脏之精，宁不有似肝脏之伤神动气，致精失守而走泄者乎？然则治当何如？曰：独肾泄者治其肾，由他脏而致肾之泄者则两治之，在他脏自泄者治其本脏，必察四属以求其治。大抵精自心而泄，则血脉空虚，本纵不收；自肺而泄者，皮革毛焦，喘急不利；自脾而泄者，色黄肉消，四肢懈惰；自肝而泄者，色青而筋痿；自肾而泄者，色黄黑髓空而骨惰，即脉亦可辨也。　　或问夜梦交接之理何如？曰：《内经》曰，肾者主水，受五脏六腑之精而藏之。又曰：主蛰，封藏之本，精之处也。又曰：阴阳之要，阳密乃固。阳强不能密，阴气乃绝。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>阴平阳秘，精神乃治；阴阳离决，精气乃绝。又曰：阴阳总宗筋之会，会于气街。《灵枢》淫邪发梦篇曰：厥气客于阴器，则梦接内。盖阴器者，宗筋之所系也，而足太阴、阳明、少阴、厥阴之筋，皆结聚于阴器，与冲、任、督三脉之所会。然厥阴主筋，故诸筋皆统属于厥阴也。肾为阴，主藏精。肝为阳，主疏泄。阴器乃泄精之窍，是故肾之阴虚则精不藏，肝之阳强则气不固。若遇阴邪客于其窍，与所强之阳相感，则精脱出而成梦矣。所谓阳强者，非脏之真阳强也，乃肝脏所寄之相火强耳。盖水为阴，火为阳，故统言火为阳，然分言之则为二。若火盛不已，反消亡其脏之真阳也。肝乃魂之居，脏之真阳虚则游魂为变，变则为梦，与肝虚病者多梦亡人无异。曰：如子所言，梦遗则从肝肾得之乎？曰：不然。病之初起，亦有不在肾、肝，而在心、肺、脾、胃之不足者。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>然必传于肝、肾而后精方走也，盖有自然相传之理存焉。何则？宗筋者，上络胸腹，挟脐，下合横骨。故《内经》谓其总阴阳之会，会于气街，主束骨而利机关也。夫五脏俱有火，其相火之寄于肝者，善则发生，恶则为害，独甚于他火。故平人肝气之刚勇，充于筋而为罢极之本也。其阴器既宗筋之所聚，乃强于作用，皆相火充其力也。若遇接内得阴气与合，则三焦上下内外之火，翕然而下从，百体元府悉开，其滋生之精，尽趋会于阴器以跃出，岂止肾之所藏者而已哉？所谓厥气客于阴器则梦者，其厥气亦身中阴分所逆之气，与接内之气同是阴类，故梦犹接内之精脱也。若思欲不已，精气已客于阴器，至卧故成梦而泄矣。但梦者因真阳虚而得之，故精脱之后，其气未能卒复，未免形体衰惫，不比平人接内之气，一二时便可复也。曰：治法当何如？曰：病从他脏而起，则以初感病者为本，肾、肝聚病处为标。若由肾、肝二脏自得者，独治肾、肝。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>由阴阳离决，水火不交通者，则既济之。阴阳不相抱负者，则因而和之。阳虚者补其气，阴虚者补其血，阳强者泻其火。火有正治反治，从多从少，随其攸利。经曰：思想无穷，所愿不得，意淫于外，入房太甚，宗筋弛纵，发为白淫梦遗等证。先贤治法有五：其一，用辰砂、磁石、龙骨之类，镇坠神之浮游，河间秘真丸、本事八仙丹之属是也。其二，思想结成痰饮，迷于心窍而遗者，许学士用猪苓丸之类，导利其痰是也。其三，思想伤阴者，洁古珍珠粉丸、海藏大凤髓丹、本事清心丸，丹溪用海蛤粉、青黛、香附、黄蘗、知母之类降火升阴是也。其四，思想伤阳者，谦甫鹿茸、苁蓉、菟丝子等补阳是也。其五，阴阳俱虚者，丹溪治一形瘦人便浊梦遗，作心虚治，用珍珠粉丸、定志丸是也。　　大智禅师云：梦遗不可全作虚冷，亦有经络热而得之者。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>尝治一男子，至夜脊心热梦遗，用珍珠粉丸、猪苓丸，遗止，终服紫雪，脊热始除。又一男子脉洪腰热遗精，用沉香和中丸下之，导赤散治其火而愈。于此知身有热而遗者，皆热遗也。若是用心过度而得之，宜远志丸，用交感汤加莲肉、五味吞下，仍佐以灵砂丹。若是思色欲不遂得之，宜以四七汤吞白丸子，甚者耳闻目见，其精即出，名曰白淫，妙香散吞玉华白丹。初虞世治精滑不禁，用青州白丸子，辰砂为衣，服之甚效。若审是色欲过度，下元虚惫，泄滑无禁，宜正元饮加牡蛎粉、肉苁蓉各半钱，吞养气丹或灵砂丹，仍佐以鹿茸丸、山药丸、大菟丝子丸、固阳丸之类。然此项药太僭燥，若妄用过剂，则阴水耗竭，壮火独炎，枯脂消肉，骨立筋痿，而成不救之疾矣，用者审之！　　医家大法曰：尝治脱真不止者，以濇剂收止之，则不能收、不能止，不若泻心火；若泻心火不能止者，不若用升阳之剂，加风药之类止之。非此能止之也，举其气上而不下也。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>　　　　医贯 【明　赵献可】</p>

Therefore, the five organs, which govern the storage of essence, must not be harmed; if harmed, they will lose control and become Yin deficient. In a state of Yin deficiency, there is no Qi, and without Qi, there is death.<br>[Note: Fear injures the kidneys, thus unresolved fear harms the essence in the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones, hence when the essence is harmed, the bones weaken and wither. The essence tends to descend when the organ Qi is harmed and cannot store anymore. The spirit and energy are born from the essence, thus the essence of the five organs must not be harmed; harm leads to loss of control and Yin deficiency, and in Yin deficiency, the spirit is cut off and death ensues.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Lin (Strangury)</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on the Five Zang states: When heat resides in the upper jiao (region), it causes cough leading to lung atrophy. If heat resides in the middle jiao, it results in hardness. If heat resides in the lower jiao, it causes urinary blood, also making the strangury difficult to pass. The chapter on Strangury states: The condition of strangury is such that the urine appears like grains of millet, with a tense lower abdomen and pain radiating to the navel. Those suffering from strangury should not induce sweating, as it will result in blood in the urine.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of Essence</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on Blood Stasis states: The condition due to overexertion manifests as a floating and large pulse, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet. Symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and improve in autumn and winter. Cold yin can lead to spontaneous loss of essence, with sourness and debilitation impeding circulation. In men, the pulse is floating, weak, and hesitant, indicating infertility with cool essence. For those suffering loss of essence, there are tense sensations in the lower abdomen, coldness in the lower Yin, dizziness, and hair loss. A very weak, hollow, and slow pulse indicates the absence of essence and blood. If the pulse is slightly floating but with a tight feeling, it indicates loss of essence in men and dreams of intercourse in women, which should be treated with Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Decoction. A pulse that is tense and large indicates reduction, while a large pulse suggests emptiness; reduction suggests coldness, while emptiness suggests deficiency. When deficiency and coldness combine, it is termed &quot;transformative disorder.&quot; For women, there may be excessive vaginal discharge, and for men, loss of blood and essence. Symptoms of deficiency from overexertion include urgency in the abdomen, palpitations, nasal bleeding, abdominal pain, dreams of loss of essence, soreness in the limbs, restlessness in the hands and feet, dryness in the throat and mouth; Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction is indicated for these symptoms.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Central Scriptures</strong> by Hua Tuo (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>On Difficulties in Passing Urine</strong></p>
<p>Those who experience difficulty in urination have issues with the five organs not functioning properly, the six bowels being imbalanced, the three jiao (burners) congested, and the nourishment and defense systems being depleted. Factors such as excessive heat in the stomach from drinking alcohol, becoming overly intoxicated during intimate acts, exhausting one&#39;s spirit, and damaging blood energy can contribute to this condition. Sometimes, it may be due to excitement leading to depleted essence, or indulgence causing the true fluids to be frequently lost. Additionally, anxiety and worry can disturb this process, improper timing with hunger or fullness can result in complications, and excessive movement or holding back urination can lead to issues. Cold may invade the bladder, prolonged outburst may cause retention, and heat in the bladder can injure one&#39;s balance, thereby resulting in this affliction.</p>
<p>The manifestations vary, leading to different names for the conditions, which can be classified into eight types: cold, heat, qi, labor, grease, sand, deficiency, and excess. Cold conditions manifest as frequent urination with clear, watery output. Heat conditions are characterized by dark, painful, and concentrated urine. Qi-related issues involve a sensation of fullness in the abdomen accompanied by painful and obstructed urination. Labor-related issues present as continuous dripping, resembling a leaking faucet. Grease-related problems involve urination that expels substances resembling greasy fat.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sand refers to hidden pain in the lower abdomen and difficulty in urination. The pain is intolerable and feels like sand or stones in the urination, which may be as large as a jujube seed, and can be red or white with variable hues. This occurs due to weak kidney energy, excessive indulgence in lust, blockage without release, continuous overflow, which injures true energy and allows evil heat to accumulate, forming sand. It is similar to how water boils salt; with intense heat and little water, salt gradually turns into stone. The kidneys are associated with water; salty flavors return to the kidneys and accumulate there. When water is retained below and virtual heat intensifies, it cooks down to form sand, which is not a sudden condition. The distance from the fire leads to its development over five years; if it deteriorates, it happens in three years. For strong individuals, calamity may occur in five years, making urgent treatment necessary. Among the various types of painful urination, this one is the most critical. A pulse that is strong, large, and firm can be treated, while a weak, small, and thin pulse cannot. The weak condition implies that both the kidneys and the bladder are deficient, leading to involuntary leakage during dreams and inability to control urination. The strong condition indicates blocked channels, where water flow is hindered, resulting in pain in the loins and aching legs. Furthermore, diseases related to painful urination correspond to pulse characteristics; those aligned with pulse will live, while the contrary may die. The method of treatment also requires careful consideration.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Urethral Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When heat accumulates in the middle burner, it becomes firm; when heat accumulates in the lower burner, it leads to blood in the urine, causing urethral obstruction. This often occurs in those with deficiencies taking large doses, provoked by heat in the lower burner. There can also be naturally occurring heat in the lower burner that is only slight but should be carefully monitored. </p>
<p>In all cases of qi dysuria, the symptoms involve difficulty urinating, often with residual dripping. In stone dysuria, there is pain in the stem and an inability to urinate completely. In glaucoma dysuria, the urine flows out like grease. In overwork dysuria, fatigue triggers the onset; pain radiates, driving qi downwards. In heat dysuria, heat triggers the onset, with severe cases resulting in blood in the urine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Six Writings of Hejian</strong><br><strong>[By Liu Wansuo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lin</strong></p>
<p>Lin refers to painful urination, which occurs due to heat invading the bladder, leading to blockage that prevents proper discharge. It is said that if urination is painful and does not flow, it is due to heat; if there is involuntary urination, it is due to cold. One must understand that severe heat invades the kidney area, becoming dry from the foot&#39;s jueyin channel, where the blockage is extreme, and thus the qi and blood cannot circulate. This leads to weakness and lack of function, causing fluids to seep into the bladder, resulting in loss of control over urination. </p>
<p>The classics say: the eye requires blood to see, the ear requires blood to hear, the hand requires blood to grasp, the palm requires blood to grip, the foot requires blood to walk, the organs require blood for fluids, and the bowels require blood for qi. Blood travels with qi; when qi and blood circulate smoothly, the spirit will become clear and its functions will be used. Furthermore, blood and qi are the spirit of a person and should be carefully nurtured. Therefore, all activities should be practiced regularly to ensure smooth circulation of qi and blood, allowing for functionality; if obstructed, the flow will be weak and the way will not be effective, hence leading to deterioration. If the illness is extremely heated, it will cause blockage, preventing the circulation of qi and blood, leading the spirit to lack functionality and inhibiting its natural processes, dependent on the severity of the blockage.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when the eyes are obstructed, one cannot see colors; when the ears are obstructed, one cannot hear sounds; when the nose is obstructed, one cannot smell fragrances or odors; when the tongue is obstructed, one cannot discern flavors. As for muscle weakness and joint pain, when one cannot use their limbs, it is all caused by excessive heat and stagnation. Hence, Zhang Zhongjing explains in his discussion of lesser yin disease with extreme heat that symptoms such as urination and defecation loss, wild talk, and the eyes unable to see straight are first signs of kidney exhaustion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the kidneys govern the two yin. Therefore, when water is deficient and weak, and heat stagnates in that area, the two yin become blocked, leading to weakness, numbness, and the spirit having no use, which results in loss of urination and defecation that cannot be controlled. This proves heat is present. Thus, although ancient prescriptions say it is a case of cold heat, they only use cold medicines like elm bark, Huangqin, Qumai, Fuling, Tongcao, Jisuo, (wooded) plum seed, and Zhi Zi to treat it. Although the theory may seem irrational, the formula indeed has merit. Due to not understanding the mechanisms of qi&#39;s movement and changes, it is reasonable that some may recognize it as incorrect. Some suggest that patients with urethritis recover by taking caraway, Yizhi, talc, or warming alcohol, thinking this implies coldness. Little do they know that these are key medicines to promote urination. While the nature of warming alcohol and Yizhi is hot, caraway is warm, and talc is cold, these can dissipate stagnation, allowing qi and fluids to circulate, leading to heat dispersal and recovery.</p>
<p>Cloudy Urination</p>
<p>Cloudy urination: In hot weather, the water is turbid; in cold weather, it is clean. This is because clean water is clear while fiery water is turbid. Similarly, when clear water becomes broth, it naturally becomes cloudy.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Endless in thought, one’s desires remain unfulfilled. When one indulges externally and enters too deeply into the room of desire, their tendons weaken and hair turns white. Excess leads to a draining of essence, hence causing fatigue and weakness. The remedy for this is the Secret True Pill.</p>
<p>The Classic of Difficulties states: &quot;The condition relates to both the urinary passage and blockage. If the passage is blocked, urination cannot occur. Furthermore, blockage signifies an absence of release; all is due to pathogenic heat.&quot; Treatment lies in distinguishing between qi and blood. If thirst is present yet urination is difficult, it indicates heat in the upper jiao (thoracic cavity), hence the presence of thirst with poor urination. Urination is governed by the foot shaoyang bladder channel, which flourishes in the metal of the west. The lungs control the generation of water; if there is heat in the lungs, they cannot produce water, cutting off the source of fluids.</p>
<p>The text states: &quot;When there is deficiency, nourish the mother.&quot; Thus, one should clear the lungs and nourish their transformative source. Therefore, one should follow the essence of the lungs, assist with the autumn season, and water will naturally flow. Just as rain, dew, and frost descend from the heavens, they embody the yin within yang, reflecting that autumn qi descends from above. Furthermore, there are medicines with subtle qi that embody yin within yang; these are affected by the autumn’s cleansing and chilling air, thus able to supplement any deficiency in the lungs. Mild-flavored herbs that promote drainage are suitable for this purpose, such as Poria, Alisma, Amber, Lampwick, Glabrous Plantain, Mutong, Juxiang, and others, which clear lung qi, drain heat, and support the source of water.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is not thirsty but has difficulty urinating, it indicates heat in the lower burner affecting the blood component, which leads to lack of thirst and significant dryness, resulting in urinary obstruction. The heat is trapped in the lower burner involving the kidneys and bladder. Thus, when the yin is heated, it obstructs the upward flow, as described by Yi Lao: cold resides in the chest, blocking entry; heat in the lower burner causes stagnation and inconvenience. One must use the transformation of cold northern waters and medicines with cold properties to eliminate heat and relieve the obstruction. </p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: without yang, yin cannot be generated; without yin, yang cannot transform. If one takes medicines that are mildly diuretic, their nature is yin within yang, not purely yang, hence yang cannot transform, and how can one supplement the insufficiency of heavy yin? Rather, one should use earth-like waters yielding an intensely bitter taste, combined with heavenly cold medicines producing great cold energy; this energy and taste are entirely yin, representing yin within yin. The essence of great cold is received, leading to the generation of the bladder; the movement of cold waters leads to the generation of the kidneys. This medicine can supplement both the kidneys and bladder, countering the vigor of yang and the evil of heat, thereby causing urinary blockage. When using intensely bitter and cold medicines, treatment must approach cold due to heat. It is also stated that one must first address the main issue while considering the underlying cause, where the beginning shares similar energy, but the end diverges.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Danxi Heart Methods</strong><br><em>By Zhu Zhenheng, Yuan Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>Lin (Dysuria)</strong></p>
<p>There are five types of dysuria, all associated with heat. To resolve heat and promote urination, one should use substances like gardenia fruit. Take one he (a unit of measurement) of peeled gardenia and consume it with white broth.</p>
<p>Dysuria refers to the condition where the urine dribbles, with a sense of urgency to urinate but inability to do so; it comes and goes, all as a result of heat. The causes of dysuria stem from kidney deficiency leading to heat in the bladder. When water and fire do not interact, the heart and kidneys become stagnant, causing disharmony between yin and yang, leading to the mixing of clarity and turbidity, and storage in the lower body. This results in a sudden urge from the bladder, along with mucus, blood, sand, and stones excreting through the urinary passage, thus manifesting as a feeling of urgency without relief, and worse, a blockage in between that can lead to severe discomfort.</p>
<p>In general, when the small intestine has gas, the urine becomes distended; when it has blood, the urine becomes thick; when it has heat, the urine becomes painful. Painful urination constitutes blood dysuria, while painless urination refers to blood in the urine. If there are remnants of sperm blockage, it results in sand; if sperm disperses, it leads to mucus; if there are stones, they result from heavy substances in the urine. Thick, frequent urination suggests gas. Understanding the fundamental causes helps classify them accordingly.</p>
<p>The method of treatment involves using agents that dispel stagnant gas, promote urination, and clear away evil heat, which also aids in balancing heart fire. When the heart is clear, urination will naturally become smooth; when the heart is balanced, blood will not flow indiscriminately. It is vital to avoid using tonics for qi, as that may alleviate pressure but increase distension; tonics for blood may worsen thickening; and tonics for heat will further intensify it. If water passages are obstructed and the channels are blocked, no beneficial effects can be observed.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the kidney qi is weak, and there is cold in the bladder, one may still experience a painful and frequent urination accompanied by cold sensations, first presenting as chills and then urination issues. This occurs because the cold qi and the righteous qi are in conflict; when the cold qi is strong, it leads to chills and results in painful urination, whereas when the righteous qi is strong, the chills resolve and normal urination occurs. </p>
<p>Additionally, when there is obstruction in the womb system, this should not be overlooked. An obstruction manifests as acute pain below the navel and difficulty in urination. Resisting the urge to urinate, whether upon sudden urgency, or while being full from food, riding a horse while needing to urinate, or holding it in while entering a bedroom, causes the water qi to reverse upward, pressuring the womb, preventing it from relaxing. If the womb collapses, it leads to demise.</p>
<p>Anuria (li) refers to obstruction; failing to pass urine results in anuria, while incontinence is classified as leakage. Dribbling, painful urination is referred to as lin, while urgent, distended, and obstructed urination is called bi. It is advisable to use Wuling San or Dengxin Decoction for treatment. If there is further distension below the navel, adding one tael of amber powder greatly enhances the effectiveness.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those with gonorrhea, if the various purgative medicines fail to alleviate, one should use a fragrance from wood and flow concoction, or alternatively a different fragrant remedy for dispelling gas that may bring recovery. This type of dysuria arises from the influence of both cold and heat. </p>
<p>Regarding blood dysuria, one must observe the color of the blood to determine whether it is due to hot or cold. If the color is bright red, it indicates excessive heat in the heart and small intestine; if it is purplish, it signifies deficiency and cold in the kidneys and bladder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Red and White Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>Turbidity is governed by dampness and heat, accompanied by phlegm and deficiency. Red pertains to blood, while white pertains to qi. Dysentery and leucorrhea share similar treatments. Cold leads to hardness and stagnation, while heat promotes circulation.</p>
<p>Generally, it is damp phlegm that flows and gathers, so it is advisable to dry the dampness in the middle burner using Erchen Decoction supplemented with苍朮 (agrimony) and白朮 (white atractylodes) to eliminate the dampness. The red indicates that dampness has harmed the blood, thus white peony root should be added. Additionally, use pearl powder pills with臭椿根 (stinkwood root), white bark, talcum, and青黛 (indigo) to prepare pill medicine. For deficiency and fatigue, one should use yin-tonifying herbs, generally avoiding heat. </p>
<p><strong>[An alternate text suggests using cooling herbs.]</strong> </p>
<p>Individuals with a plump and white complexion are likely to have excess phlegm, thus Erchen Decoction should be used to remove damp heat. If the stomach is weak, ginseng should be included, along with柴胡 (bule), and升麻 (black cohosh) to boost the qi in the stomach. For pill medicine, use yellow bitter herb roasted to a brown color, dried ginger roasted slightly black, talcum, clam powder, and indigo, and then mix into pills for consumption.</p>
<p>Dampness and turbidity flow downward in the stomach, resulting in red and white turbidity. Use Erchen Decoction with柴胡,升麻,苍朮, and白朮. For pill medicine, use the ground powder of樗皮 (buckthorn), clam powder roasted, dried ginger roasted, and yellow bitter herb. If dampness flows down into the bladder, use indigo and clam powder. For a tight liver pulse, indigo should be used to drain the liver. Another formula consists of one liang of roasted yellow bitter herb, one liang of fresh bitter herb, three liang of talcum, and half a liang of shenqu (medicated leaven) ground into powder, mixed with water to form pills.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>Each of the five organs and six bowels of a person contains essence. However, the kidney stores essence and is governed by the heart, relying on the balance of water and fire for the internal holding of essence.

<p>Red turbidity arises from a deficiency of the heart coupled with heat, resulting from excessive contemplation. White turbidity is due to a deficiency of the kidneys with cold, arising from excessive lust. It appears swirl-like and white, glistening unevenly, while the base remains clear and thick like paste. </p>
<p>For treatment: for red turbidity, clear the heart and regulate the qi; for white turbidity, warm and tonify the lower source. Additionally, one must clear the upper area, so that water and fire harmonize, and yin and yang are in balance, allowing the essence and qi to secure themselves. </p>

<p>Dream emission is primarily related to heat, similar to the conditions of discharges and seminal leakage. The treatment involves using indigo, sea stone, and yellow bile.

<p>When thoughts lead to illness, and the affliction is in the heart, it is advisable to take peace-promoting pills along with tonics.

<p>The causes of this condition are fourfold: excessive mental activity leading to a failure of the heart to contain the kidney energy, resulting in loss of essence; desires unfulfilled leading to the essence being misplaced and flowing out; excessive desire leading to uncontrollable leakage; or youthful vitality being abundant but long absence of sexual expression resulting in excess flow. </p>
<p>Symptoms vary: some may experience uncontrollable discharges after urination, while others might have leakage without urination, or experience itching and pain in the penis, often feeling as though they need to urinate. It is advisable first to take cinnabar aromatic powder, or a tranquilizing pill, or a clear drink, packaged with cotton along with dragon bone for boiling. Alternatively, take a clear drink with additional ingredients: fivefold fruit, oyster powder, white poria, and Schisandra each measured at half a qian and decocted for consumption.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Linjing (Dysuria)</strong></p>
<p>The five types of lin (dysuria) are blood, stone, qi, cream, and labor. Blood lin is characterized by the presence of blood in the urine. Stone lin shows the appearance of sand or stones in the urine, and there is a sound when urinating in a basin; this is due to essence and qi that have solidified into sand or stones, which are expelled along with the urine. Qi lin results from qi stagnation, presenting as a sensation in the lower abdomen akin to bladder pressure. Cream lin occurs when urine mixes with essence, appearing either as a thick paste sinking down or as a greasy substance floating on top. Labor lin arises from various colors in the urine, indicating a deficiency in the lower source, with clear and turbid not being separated, leading to sluggish kidney qi and its stasis resulting in dysuria. It may occur due to excessive mental strain, leading to insufficient nourishment of fire; the small intestine, being the excretory branch of the heart, may become ill concurrently. Additionally, it can stem from the heart and kidney not communicating, with kidney qi being unable to warm, or due to excessive sweating, or excessive blood loss, which may lead to depletion of fluids, all contributing to labor lin. These five are named, yet do not include hot and cold conditions, why is that? Because each of the five possesses attributes of both cold and heat.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are two types of blood: hot blood and stagnant blood; two types of qi: hot qi and cold qi; and two types of labor: deficient cold and deficient heat. If one mistakenly uses decoctions and medicines too hastily, without following the proper course, and fails to restrain reckless actions, one may suffer from the harm of hot agents—not to be regarded merely as cold. </p>
<p>The treatment should exclude true deficient cold; for other conditions, if the original prescription proves ineffective, one should appropriately employ rectifying qi agents. Understanding the balance of the pathways of fluids relies entirely on the flow and blockage of qi. For example, the Wood Fragrance Flowing Qi Drink is indeed suitable, comprising ingredients like Moutan, Ophiopogon, and possibly some others. If that proves ineffective, one should resort to formulas that enrich the blood, as urination reflects the surplus of blood. When the blood is ample, it nourishes and moistens downward, facilitating natural flow. </p>
<p>The Fire Palace Pill is appropriately tailored as well, containing Chinese Foxglove and similar herbs. However, this is not limited to just blood or qi stagnation; it can be used for any related issues, except for true deficient cold. In cases of urinary conditions, the urine color is often red; one should not hastily assume this signifies heat, for it can instead be due to the blockage of qi pathways, hence the appearance.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is a case of gonorrhea, using various laxatives may cure it. If it does not respond, using a herbal remedy to promote the flow of Qi may help; otherwise, using a different aromatic remedy for this purpose can also lead to recovery. This is known as Qi Lin, which occurs apart from hot or cold Lin issues.</p>
<p>There are cases that resemble Lin but are not Lin. When the urine is as discolored as rice washing water, or if it has a mucous-like appearance, this indicates both essence and urine are being expelled. The essence blocks the channels, causing a painful inability to urinate. It is advisable to use large doses of Cuscuta seeds pills or deer antler pills. However, this can also be considered as Gao Lin, meaning it cannot be dismissed as Lin altogether.</p>
<p>In the case of blood Lin, one must observe the color of the blood for signs of heat or cold: if the color is bright, it indicates excess heat in the heart and small intestine; if the color is dark and purplish, it means there is cold deficiency in the kidneys and bladder. For cold Lin and cases of deficiency in the lower abdomen with dark blood, it is advised to finely grind the roots of Sichuan pepper and boil them in water until cool for consumption.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>White Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>There are individuals with white turbidity who do not improve even after taking Yuan Tu Dan, but do recover after taking the Fuzi Eight Flavor Pill; this should not be overlooked. There are cases where urination is normal, but after a long pause, it becomes turbid, and when urinated, appears like murky water. If it concerns a child suffering from malnutrition, it is advisable to prepare a clear drink with half a qian of white poria. If the medication has not been effective, it is recommended to take Si Qi Decoction, swallow Qingzhou White Pill, and Chen Sha Miao Xiang Powder, or take Yuan Tu Dan and small Cuscuta Pills, along with yam pills. If the white turbidity is severe, appearing muddy or thick and adhesive, with frequent abdominal pain, this is not due to hot lin (dysuria) but rather a blockage of the passageways due to turbid essence accumulating. The remedy should be the Wu Ling Miao Xiang Powder, along with the Eight Flavor Pill and small Cuscuta Pills. </p>
<p>Essence is transformed from blood; when there is excessive turbidity leading to insufficient essence transformation, resulting in a failure for red to turn white, it leads to red turbidity, indicating severe deficiency. How can this be determined? There are cases where individuals have yet to reach their prime, are overly vigorous, and experience a discharge that is half essence and half blood. If the urine is not red and there are no other heat symptoms, even if it appears turbid red, it should not be treated as heat; instead, one should apply treatments for white turbidity. If urine is red and the turbidity is also red, accompanied by thirst and fever, it is necessary to take Chen Sha Miao Xiang Powder and the Ling Sha Dan, or have a Clear Heart Lotus Seed Drink. If the fever persists and there is severe dryness of the mouth and tongue, this indicates internal dryness due to essence deficiency and kidney depletion; one should use Si Wu Decoction, swallow Yuan Tu Dan, and combine it with the Eight Flavor Pill for prolonged treatment to see results.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Semen Loss</strong></p>
<p>Semen loss occurs in four ways: first, when the mind is overly engaged and fails to regulate the kidneys, leading to loss of semen; second, when frustrated desires for sexual pleasure cause the semen to lose its proper place and leak out; third, when excessive desire causes uncontrolled discharge; and fourth, when youthful vigor is high and there has been a long absence of sexual desire, leading to an excessive outflow of vital energy. The symptoms vary; some may have frequent urination that is hard to control, while others may experience spontaneous discharge without urination, or a sensation of itch and pain in the genitals, often feeling the urge to urinate. </p>
<p>For treatment, one should initially use the Chen-sha Miao-Xiang Powder and swallow the Yu-hua Bai-Dan, paired with Wei-Xi Pills. Alternatively, one can prepare a clear drink, wrapping Long-gu in cotton and boiling it together, or make a clear drink with half of each ingredient: Wu-wei-zi, Bai Fu-ling, and Mu-li, each half a qian. </p>

The original formula, Qing-xin Pill, with Huang-pi&#39;s essence, is most effective. Yet, one must confirm the presence of heat symptoms. If there is red moistness, it might also indicate internal heat, warranting this treatment. </p>
<p>If the condition arises from excessive mental effort, use Zhi-yuan Pills along with Jiao-gang Decoction, adding lotus seed flesh and Wu-wei-zi, and swallow them down, still supplementing with Ling-sha Dan. If it is determined to stem from frustrated desires, take Si-qi Decoction with white pills.

The classics say: &quot;When kidney Qi is blocked, essence leaks.&quot; The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: &quot;The kidney is the palace of strength, from which skillful talent emerges.&quot; It also states: &quot;The kidney stores essence.&quot; This is because the kidney is able to capture essence to procreate humanity, which may manifest or disperse, all governed by the kidney. Now, when kidney Qi is weak, the essence of the whole body cannot be properly contained, hence it goes astray and flows out inappropriately. The Zhu Ling Pill is formulated precisely for this reason.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dreaming of Emission</strong></p>
<p>Dreaming leads to emission; many believe it is due to kidney deficiency and treat it with tonics aimed at replenishing the kidneys and replenishing essence, yet find no efficacy. Little do they know this condition often relates to the spleen and stomach, commonly seen in those who indulge in alcohol and rich foods, and who possess phlegm-heat and dampness. The kidneys store essence, which is generated from the sweet nourishment of the spleen and stomach and subsequently sent back to the kidneys. When the spleen and stomach are harmed by heavy substances, damp heat accumulates, leading to unclear central energy, which in turn causes the essence produced to also be impure. The kidneys govern storage and, when the Yin is still, all is at peace. However, if the essence delivered contains impure energy, then the evil fire stirs within the kidneys, disrupting the stillness of water, resulting in emissions that are slippery. This condition is akin to &quot;whitening.&quot; Dan Xi discusses &quot;whitening&quot; as the descending impure energy from the stomach infiltrating the bladder, asserting that no one understands this. Those who have overly heavy desires and excessive fantasies, leading to slippery emissions should be treated with both heart and kidney in mind. However, since many have simultaneous spleen and stomach issues, careful examination is required. </p>
<p>[Note: There are four types of emissions: one arising from excessive heart activity that fails to contain the kidneys; one caused by unmet desires leading the essence to lose its position; one from excessive sexual desire causing unrestrained slippery emissions; and one from a youthful vigor overflowing when there has been a long absence of sexual activity. Symptoms may include frequent involuntary urination, or a feeling of needing to urinate without actually doing so, or an itch and pain in the genitals, often accompanied by the urge to urinate. Recommended treatments include Shen Sha Miao Xiang San or Wei Xi Wan.]<br>Medical Entry Level 【Ming - Li Zhan】 </p>

<p>Urinary issues are generally associated with heat, although there can be cases of cold. External factors like wind-cold can provoke symptoms, while internal factors such as emotional disturbances affect the heart and kidney energies, causing dysfunction in the small intestine and bladder. This can be exacerbated by anger, sexual activity, repression of urination, and consumption of alcohol and fatty foods, leading to damp heat that impedes the bladder. Initially, symptoms may present as heat or blood-tinged urination, while prolonged conditions can result in stones formed from heat, similar to how excessive boiling transforms a liquid into a concentrated substance.</p>
<p>When heat resides in the upper burner, causing thirst and difficulty in urination, it suggests latent heat in the lungs, resulting in an inability to disperse water.

If it is not due to the Heart and Kidneys not communicating, but rather caused by excessive drinking of rich food, it leads to damp heat being internally stagnant, which clouds the central qi, causing the essence that is generated to be turbid, returning to the kidneys, and thus water becomes unsettled, resulting in leakage. It is advisable to add herbs that nourish Yin, such as ginseng, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, to enhance the clear qi in the stomach, and it is also important to regulate diet to strengthen the root of life.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment of Various Types of Lin Syndrome</strong>  </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; Lin syndrome is associated with both dampness and heat. The &quot;Discussion of Disease Origins&quot; states that the bladder and kidneys are interrelated and both govern water. Water enters the small intestine and relates to bodily excretions. If one does not regulate their diet or emotions, or if there is an imbalance of deficiency and excess, or disharmony within the organs, it can lead to kidney deficiency and bladder heat. Kidney deficiency results in frequent urination, while bladder heat leads to painful and urgent urination. When there is urgency and pain, it may be classified into six types: stone lin, labor lin, blood lin, qi lin, greasy lin, and cold lin. </p>
<p>Stone lin consists of gravel-like particles caused by heat accumulating in the bladder, similar to how minerals might accumulate at the bottom of a pot if it is left over a fire for too long. Labor lin occurs due to exhaustion, often linked to spleen deficiency. Blood lin results from the heart governing blood, as residual heat affects the small intestine and interacts with blood vessels, leading blood to mix with urine during excretion.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of qi lin, the lungs govern qi; when the transformation of qi does not reach the region, it causes a buildup of qi in the body, leading to fullness and hardness in the lower abdomen, with excessive dripping during urination. In the case of gao lin, there is a dripping of fatty fluid, resembling oil or fat. For leng lin, cold invades the lower body, obstructing the water pathways. Symptoms begin with chills and shivering, followed by the formation of lin. </p>
<p>Additionally, excessive consumption of minerals, or overly vigorous intercourses, can harm essence and cause it to flow into the body, resulting in damp phlegm that develops into lin over time. Consequently, the causes of lin are numerous, and without addressing the root, one cannot expect to recover. </p>
<p>To clear the accumulated heat of shi lin and eliminate stones and sand, the water pathways can be naturally improved, using remedies such as Shenxiao HuPo San, RuSheng San, or DuSheng San, selected based on symptoms. </p>
<p>Lao lin can be differentiated into spleen-related lao and kidney-related lao. Excessive thinking and worrying, heavy lifting, long travels, and social obligations exhaust the spleen, so the remedies should include Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Wu Ling San. For issues mainly rooted in worry, Gui Pi Tang should be used. Conversely, if excessive vigor during intercourse or unrestrained discharges exhaust the kidneys, Sheng Di Huang Wan or Huang Qi Tang should be considered.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to ancient and modern perspectives, involuntary semen loss is generally viewed as a condition of weakened kidney energy, not affecting other organs. However, it is unknown that the classics state each of the five organs and six bowels contains essence, with the kidneys being the receiver and reservoir. If one experiences involuntary loss without dreaming, it is largely due to heart and kidney damage; if it occurs after dreaming, it is mainly harmful due to excessive fire (passion). When all five organs are fulfilling their roles, essence is stored and regulated. If even one organ fails in its proper function, it can negatively impact the essence controlled by the heart and kidneys. </p>
<p>The treatment method differs: for loss directly caused by kidney issues, one treats the kidneys. If caused by other organs, both the affected organ and the kidneys are treated. For instance, if the heart is ill and leads to loss, it is likely due to a deficiency in blood vessels; if caused by the lungs, it is due to insufficient vitality, resulting in shortness of breath; if by the spleen, one may notice yellowing skin and weakness in limbs; if by the liver, the complexion turns green and muscle weakness follows; if the kidneys are involved, the complexion turns dark and the marrow may be depleted. </p>
<p>It is necessary to consult the six pulses for further clarity on diagnosis, as the causes may be diverse. If excessive mental strain prevents the heart from regulating the kidneys, resulting in loss, it is advisable to use &quot;Yuan Zhi Wan&quot; and complement it with &quot;Ling Sha Dan.&quot; If loss is due to unfulfilled desires, one may take &quot;Si Qi Tang&quot; with white pills. In severe cases where stimulation leads directly to loss, referred to as &quot;white indulgence,&quot; one should take &quot;Miao Xiang San&quot; with &quot;Yu Hua Bai Dan.&quot; If desires are excessive, leading to slippery essence, one should use &quot;Zheng Yuan San&quot; mixed with equal parts oyster shell powder and Herba Cistanchis, swallow with &quot;Ling Sha Dan,&quot; and also supplement with deer antler pills, Chinese yam pills, Cuscuta pills, and solidifying yang pills.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>Upon examining the classical texts and studying the arguments of previous philosophers, it is understood that turbidity disorders are indeed disorders of essence, not disorders of urine. Therefore, those suffering from turbidity experience sensations like being cut by a knife or burned by fire within the stem, while the urine remains clear. Only at the urethral opening is there irregular discharge, akin to pus from a sore or the residue from the eyes, dripping continuously without blending with regular urination. Generally, turbidity arises from a deterioration of essence and corruption in about 60-70% of cases, while about 20-30% are due to damp heat influx and deficiency. As for the distinction between red and white, what is the reason? Essence is transformed from blood; if too much turbidity is expelled and essence is insufficiently transformed, the red doesn’t turn white, thus resulting in red turbidity, which indicates severe deficiency. In youth, before reaching maturity, vigorous sexual activity leads to a discharge that is a mix of essence and blood. In middle age, excessive release also produces mixed essence and blood. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that Danqi&#39;s association of red with blood and white with qi is entirely accurate. Furthermore, the association of red with heart deficiency and heat, arising from overthinking, and white with kidney deficiency and cold, stemming from excessive desires, is also not definitive.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In summary, when the heart is stirred by desire, the kidneys suffer from indulgence; either one forcibly endures sexual activities or excessively consumes aphrodisiacs, leading to the loss of essence and resulting in a white turbid discharge.

If there is cold, the pulse becomes deep and slow with little strength, and urination is clear; treatments like Bi-xie Fen-qing Drink, Ba-wei Pill, and Neibu Lu-rong Pill are recommended. If there is heat, thirst and red urine occur, with a rapid and strong pulse; treatments such as Qingxin Lianzi Drink and Xiangling Powder are advised. In cases where phlegm-dampness accumulates in the stomach, use Cangbai Erchen Decoction with Shengma and Chaihu. For cases of deficiency or consumption, add Liumei Pill with Lianxu, Qian-shi, Tu-si-zi, Wuwu, Longgu, and Mu-li.

<p><strong>Lyin</strong></p>
<p>The disease of lyin (dysuria) is noted in the &quot;Disease Source Treatise&quot; as resulting from kidney deficiency and bladder heat. The bladder and kidneys are internally and externally linked, both governing water. Water enters the small intestine and, in conjunction with the bladder, results in urination. If one’s diet is irregular, emotions are unregulated, there is an imbalance of deficiency and excess, and the internal organs are not harmonious, this leads to kidney deficiency and bladder heat. When the kidneys are deficient, urination becomes frequent; when there is bladder heat, there is a painful and urgent flow of urine, leading to a condition of lyin. </p>
<p>Its symptoms include sharp pain in the lower abdomen, stretching from below the navel, scanty urination, and different types of lyin: stone lyin, labor lyin, blood lyin, qi lyin, grease lyin, and cold lyin. Stone lyin presents with particles like sand; labor lyin occurs after physical exhaustion; blood lyin arises when the heart governs blood and qi, and extreme heat obstructs blood, causing it to blend with urine; grease lyin presents with a fatty, oily discharge, also known as meat lyin; qi lyin is marked by internal gas, a hardened lower abdomen, scant and frequent urination, with residual dribbling; cold lyin occurs when cold air invades the lower body, leading to conflict between pathogenic and healthy qi, causing fullness in the bladder and interrupted water flow. One first feels chills and then the frequency of urination increases to form lyin, thus presenting the full nature of the ailment. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the causes of lyin do not stop here. In summary, there are two main factors: moisture and heat.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text refers to the phenomena of various bodily ailments and their underlying causes. It states that when the yin (the moon) creates the initial Qi, there is an infusion of heat during illness, leading to swelling, with the spleen affected by dampness, resulting in dark yellow urine, and in severe cases, painful urination. The lesser yang creates a second Qi, where wind and fire become trapped above, causing heat and diseases like painful urination.</p>
<p>It explains that the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians are interconnected, which is why the greater yang governs the surface of the body. When it rises, it commands all Yang Qi, and when it descends, it enters the bladder. Additionally, the lungs regulate the flow of fluids and send them to the bladder. The spleen and stomach digest water and grains; if there is heat, then all liquids become hot, and as they are transported downward, the bladder receives them as heated.</p>
<p>The small intestine is linked to the heart and is responsible for heat. Its fluids seep into the bladder, and if heat manifests in the heart, the small intestine must also be hot. The bladder then heats from this, leading to symptoms like blood in the urine. This indicates that the initial heat pathogen is varied, but they all eventually transfer to the bladder, causing painful urination. If one does not first treat the underlying cause but instead focuses on the heat in the bladder, the treatment will not be effective.</p>
<p>The author reflects on how painful urination is primarily caused by severe heat leading to dampness, which, in turn, causes fluids to become turbid, coagulating into painful urination. Moreover, those who excessively consume medicinal minerals or engage in sexual activity may cause seminal fluid to flow into the bladder, contributing to the issue, as can the accumulation of phlegm and food.</p>
<p>There’s an example of a child who, while in the womb, suffered from the residual toxins of medicinal minerals taken for a long time, developing painful urination for fifteen years, which was cured with a remedy. The essential point is that one cannot effectively treat an illness without addressing its root cause.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>The path of urine differs from that of essence: gonorrhea pertains to the pathway of urine, which is why it is classified under the liver and gallbladder sections in the &quot;Compendium&quot;; turbidity pertains to the essence pathway, hence it is classified under the kidney and bladder sections. Those suffering from turbidity may experience severe pain in the urethra like being cut by a knife or burned by fire during urination, yet the urine itself remains clear. Only at the opening might there be refuse, such as pus from sores or eye discharge, trickling continuously, initially not mixed with urination, much like the flow in a river, making it easy to distinguish. Often, I have seen physicians treat it as gonorrhea, using Wu Ling and Ba Zheng formulas, continuously mixing them, yet this exacerbates the condition countless times; I have often corrected this but found it difficult to make this known widely. This is mostly due to the degradation and corruption of essence in nine out of ten cases, while only one out of ten arises from damp heat and deficiency.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Night Emission</strong></p>
<p>Danxi&#39;s writings divide dream emissions and fluid emissions into two categories. Dream emissions occur through interactions with spirits during dreams, while fluid emissions that do not originate from dreams are referred to as fluid emissions. Nevertheless, both are ultimately classified as nocturnal emissions. The treatment methods are the same, hence they are grouped together.</p>
<p>If one asks what causes fluid emissions, it is said: The &quot;Golden Coffer&#39;s Essentials&quot; states that diseases of deficiency and exertion are characterized by a floating, strong pulse, restlessness in the hands and feet, and coldness with the essence leaking out. It also states that when the pulse is wiry and strong, it is termed &quot;leather,&quot; signifying the loss of blood and essence. Furthermore, when the lower abdomen feels tense and the external genitalia are cold, the pulse is slightly tightening, which indicates a loss of essence in men and dream interactions in women.</p>
<p>According to Tong&#39;s &quot;Sources of Illness,&quot; the diseases of deficiency and exertion are classified into categories such as Five Exertions, Seven Injuries, Six Extremes, and Twenty-Three Steams, with the connection of essence noted among the Seven Injuries. Originally written as &quot;essence connections,&quot; it is altered here based on the &quot;Discussion of Disease Sources&quot; referencing deficiency-related conditions. The steaming condition termed &quot;jade chamber steaming,&quot; in men results in leaking essence, alongside other symptoms of essence loss, all of which are mixed within the category of deficiency diseases. Since the kidneys are responsible for storing essence, all are regarded as diseases resulting from weakened kidney energy, implying no damage to other organs.</p>
<p>Is it truly so? All five organs are involved in essence storage. Upon examining the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; it first states that what heaven represents in me is virtue. What the earth represents in me is energy; virtue flows and energy thins, thus leading to life. Therefore, the essence that derives from this is called &quot;essence,&quot; and the mingling of two essences is termed &quot;spirit.&quot; Thus, it can be said that this governs and commands the spirit of the entire body.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart and kidneys are the organs of water and fire, embodying the principles of how heaven and earth transform and generate. Therefore, the storage of spirit is the fundamental source of the five organs. </p>
<p>Next, the way to engage with things is called the heart. The heart&#39;s memories are referred to as intention; intention, when anchored, is called will. From will stems change, known as thought; from thought comes longing, known as concern; and from concern arises interaction with the world, called wisdom. All of these arise from the heart&#39;s spirit responding to external stimuli, which is known as the five intentions, giving rise to the designation of the five spiritual organs. </p>
<p>Once the five spirits are differentiated, they each govern their respective functions related to virtue, governance, and nature. Thus, the water and fire of the heart and kidneys conform to the ranks of the five spirits. However, the principal spirit they govern remains concurrent and has never been separate; while the five spirits and five changes are categorized, the essence also transforms according to the spirit, integrating wherever it goes. Therefore, each of the five organs must harbor its spirit to fulfill its function, which is called the true essence of the organs. This represents the vitality of the primary energy.</p>
<p>If the true essence of any organ is not properly aligned, then disease in that organ will arise. If the spirit of one organ is significantly harmed, it will inevitably damage the primary spirit governing the heart and kidneys. For instance, excessive anxiety and overthinking harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to unchecked desire. Joy and fear also damage essence; when essence is harmed, bones weaken, leading to decay and paralysis. </p>
<p>Those who govern essence must not be harmed; if harmed, they will lose their hold and become yin deficient. When yin is deficient, energy is depleted, and without energy, death ensues.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this way, when the spirit resides in the five organs, if injured, then indulgence and evils will arise. The heart, in its will, is associated with joy; in its energy, it represents fire and heat. The kidneys, in their will, relate to fear; in their energy, they signify water and cold. Thus, excessive fright and worry can harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fire stirs incessantly. When fire stirs incessantly, the water of the kidneys is overwhelmed by fear. Fear, if not resolved, stirs within, causing injury to the kidneys. The kidneys govern the storage of essence, and the essence received from the five organs and six bowels cannot be retained and will descend in excess. This is said in relation to the heart and kidneys, which control the spirit.</p>
<p>As for the essence of the other organs, do they all leak out? The text from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to excessive indulgence, loosening the reproductive muscles, which results in white indulgence, and its ailment is muscular atrophy. Muscular atrophy arises within the liver. The commentary indicates that white indulgence refers to a discharge resembling essence, flowing downwards in urine. Although it is said to resemble essence, it is likely not the essence that has transformed but consists of that which has not yet fully formed. </p>
<p>Why is this stated? There are two types of essence: the innate essence that one is born with; and that which is derived from food and air entering the stomach, dispersing essence throughout the five organs. There is also the essence derived from water and drink, transmitted from the spleen and lungs to the kidneys, spreading throughout the body; this is the daily essence produced from food. All the daily-produced essence is transformed from the original innate essence, which is then distributed. When the organs become full and overflow, they send it to the kidneys, which are the source of original vital energy—the root of generation, serving as the path for nourishment that begins and ends in transformation.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the essence of food encounters a disease in a zang organ, then the taste and transformation of the food in that organ will be incomplete, and it cannot enter to be stored with the original essence; instead, it will be leaked out. As for the case where the spleen transfers heat to the kidney, resulting in pain in the lower abdomen and the emission of a white substance, the principle is the same. Although Wang&#39;s commentary states that it dissipates fat and burns flesh, might it not be the essence stored in the kidney that is being consumed? If both organs are disease-free, would this white substance not be the essence? If both organs are diseased, would not the stored essence transform into this white substance and be expelled? </p>
<p>Using this as a comparison, should the essence of the lungs and spleen not also be at risk of being lost due to the disturbance of the liver, leading to the essence being violated and leaking? Therefore, how should we treat this? The answer is: for leakage originating solely from the kidney, treat the kidney. If it is caused by issues in other organs leading to kidney leakage, then treat both. If it leaks from other organs, treat the primary organ in question, and one must carefully assess the four categories to seek treatment. </p>
<p>Generally, if the essence leaks from the heart, the blood vessels become empty and fail to regulate. If it leaks from the lungs, the skin and hair become dry and coarse, leading to shortness of breath and discomfort. If it leaks from the spleen, the complexion turns yellow, the flesh deteriorates, and the limbs become weak. If it leaks from the liver, the color turns greenish, leading to weakness in the muscles. If it leaks from the kidney, the complexion turns yellow-black, the marrow is depleted, and the bones become weak; this can also be discerned from the pulse. </p>
<p>Someone might ask about the principles of dreaming at night and engaging in intimate interactions. The answer is: &quot;The Inner Canon&quot; states that the kidneys govern water and receive the essence of the five zang organs and the six fu organs to store it. It also states that it governs the hidden and is the root of storage; it is where the essence resides. Furthermore, it mentions the crucial balance of yin and yang: if yang is strong but not dense, then yin energy will be cut off.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yin and yang are secret yet balanced; when they are harmonized, the spirit is well-regulated. When yin and yang are separated, the essence and energy are void. It is said that yin and yang meet in the meeting point of the governing vessels at the energetic street. In the “Spiritual Pivot,” the chapter on the disturbance of dreams states: When the qi resides in the yin organ, dreams connect to the inner world. The yin organ is where the source vessels are linked, and the channels of the Foot Taiyin, Yangming, Shaoyin, and Jueyin all gather there, converging with the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians. Since Jueyin governs the vessels, all these vessels fall under its authority. The kidneys represent yin and store essence, while the liver represents yang and regulates the flow. The yin organ is the channel for releasing essence; therefore, when the yin of the kidney is deficient, essence cannot be stored, and when the yang of the liver is strong, energy cannot be anchored. If confronted by an external yin disturbance in this channel, it interacts with the excessive yang, causing essence to escape and leading to dreams. The so-called strong yang does not refer to the true yang of the organs, but rather the excess fire residing in the liver. Water is yin, and fire is yang; thus generally, fire is considered yang, but when specified, it can represent two aspects. If fire excessively persists, it will consume the true yang of the organs. The liver is where the soul resides; if the true yang of the organs is deficient, the wandering soul will transform, resulting in dreams, much like those who are ill with a deficiency of the liver experiencing frequent dreams of deceased individuals. When asked, &quot;As you say, does dream-related emission come from the liver and kidneys?&quot; the response is, &quot;Not necessarily. At the onset of illness, it can arise not from the kidneys or liver, but from deficiencies in the heart, lungs, spleen, or stomach.&quot;<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It must be transmitted through the liver and kidneys before the essence can move. This is fundamentally based on a natural principle of mutual transmission. Why is this so? The essence of the sinews is connected to the chest and abdomen above, encircles the navel, and joins the transverse bone below. Therefore, the Inner Classic states that it is the meeting point of yin and yang, where qi converges, governing the binding of bones and facilitating mechanisms. All five viscera possess fire, and the fire that resides in the liver is particularly significant; if it is harmonized, it generates beneficial effects, but if it is not, it causes harm, notably more than other forms of fire. Thus, the vigorous liver qi in an average person fills the sinews and serves as the root of abundance. The yin organs, gathering at the sinews, are thus strong in function, all empowered by the essence of mutual fire. If they encounter the inward connection to yin qi, then the fires of the three burners—both internal and external—converge downward, opening up all the body&#39;s original realms, allowing the nourishing essence to gather in the yin organs and surge forth. Is this limited solely to what the kidneys store? It is said that when the qi retreats to the yin organs during dreaming, this qi is also the reverse qi from the yin parts of the body, similar to the inward qi, thus dreams can be seen as the essence escaping from the inward connection. If one continues to think excessively, and the essence has already retreated into the yin organs, then upon lying down, dreams manifest and leakage occurs. However, this dreaming arises due to the deficiency of true yang; thus, after the essence has discharged, its qi cannot be completely restored, leading to physical decline, unlike average people who can recover easily within a short time after inward connection. What should be the treatment method? If the illness arises from other viscera, then treat the initial symptoms of the illness as the root, while the liver and kidney as the points of reference. If the illness arises specifically within the liver and kidneys, then treat only the liver and kidneys.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

When yin and yang do not support each other, they should be harmonized. If yang is deficient, one should supplement its energy; if yin is deficient, one should supplement its blood; if yang is strong, its fire should be drained. Fire can be treated properly or improperly, adjusted in quantity according to what is beneficial.</p>
<p>The classics say: Endless thoughts lead to unfulfilled desires, indulging in fantasies and excessive activities result in loosened tendons and cause issues like nocturnal emissions. The teachings of the ancients consist of five methods: </p>
<p>First, using cinnabar, magnetite, dragon bone, etc., to stabilize the wandering spirit—this includes secret elixirs like Hejian’s True Essence Pill and the Eight Immortals Pill. </p>
<p>Second, if thoughts coalesce into phlegm and confuse the heart’s pathways, then Scholar Xu recommends pills like Zhu Ling Wan to guide and eliminate phlegm. </p>
<p>Third, if thoughts harm Yin, using ancient pearl powder pills, sea gourd&#39;s large phoenix marrow pills, and Qingxin pills helps to reduce fire and nourish Yin—Danxi used sea clam powder, indigo, cyperus, yellow bract, and anemarrhena to achieve this. </p>
<p>Fourth, if thoughts harm Yang, ingredients like Qianfu deer antler, cistanche, and dodder seed can be used to replenish Yang. </p>
<p>Fifth, if both Yin and Yang are deficient, Danxi treats a thin person experiencing cloudy dreams by addressing heart deficiency using pearl powder pills and Dingzhi pills.</p>
<p>Great Master Zhi says: Nocturnal emissions should not be entirely considered as coldness; there can also be a heat in the meridians that leads to them.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I once treated a man who, by night, experienced a warm sensation in his spine and nocturnal emissions. I prescribed pearl powder pills and Polyporus pills, which helped to stop the emissions. He ultimately took Purple Snow (a medicinal substance), and the heat in his spine was alleviated. Another man had a flooding pulse and warm waist with emissions; I used a pill of agarwood for him and prescribed Daohong San to treat the fire, resulting in recovery. From this, I understand that all emissions due to body heat are indeed heat-induced.</p>
<p>If these are caused by excessive mental strain, it is advisable to use Zhi Yuan pills and a decoction with lotus seeds, adding Wuweizi (Schisandra) for ingestion, alongside Ling Sha Dan. If it is from unfulfilled sexual desire, it is suitable to take Si Qi Decoction with white pills. In severe cases, merely hearing or seeing can lead to emissions, known as &quot;white lust;&quot; for this, use Miaoxiang San with Yuhua Bai Dan.</p>
<p>Initially, dealing with slippery emissions, I recommended Qingzhou Bai pills coated with cinnabar, which were very effective. If it turns out that the issue is excessive sexual desire, leading to deficiency in the lower source, with emissions being uncontrollable, one should take Zhengyuan Decoction adding oyster powder and meat of Cistanchus, each at half a qian (unit of weight), ingesting Yangqi Dan or Ling Sha Dan, while also using deer antler pills, yam pills, Dodder seeds pills, and Gu Yang pills or similar.</p>
<p>However, these medicines are very potent; if improperly used in excess, it will exhaust the yin essence, inflame the strong fire, deplete the marrow and flesh, leading to lasting illness. Users must be cautious!</p>
<p>The principle of the medical professional states: When treating those with persistent emissions due to true lack of control, using harsh medications to stop them is ineffective; instead, purging the heart fire is better. If purging heart fire cannot stop it, it is advisable to use upward-raising medicines, adding wind-expelling herbs to stabilize. None other can achieve this as it raises the qi upward and does not allow it to descend.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Dream Loss of Essence</strong></p>
<p>Treatment focuses on the kidney and liver. The classics say: &quot;The essence of yin and yang is that yang must be consolidated.&quot; If yang is strong but not consolidated, yin energy will be lost. When yin is balanced and yang is concealed, the spirit is well-regulated; when yin and yang are separated, essence and energy will be depleted. The &quot;strong yang&quot; referred to here is the fire of the liver and kidney; &quot;lost yin&quot; refers to the true yin stored in the kidney. The kidney is yin and is responsible for storing essence; the liver is yang and is responsible for dispersing. Therefore, if the kidney&#39;s yin is deficient, essence cannot be stored; if the liver&#39;s yang is strong, fire cannot be concealed. With fire that cannot be concealed, like essence that cannot be stored, there will be no dreams; if there are dreams, they will leak out. </p>
<p>Someone may ask: Why is it that there are many erotic dreams and not other types? The &quot;Spiritual Axis&quot; discusses the phenomenon of dreams induced by chaotic energy affecting yin energy, thus dreams connect internally. The yin organ is the channel for seminal leakage, it governs the genitals, and is related to the Spleen, Stomach, Lesser Yin, and Greater Yin veins, as well as the Conception, Governing, and Penetrating vessels. All these channels converge in the yin organ, where the fire is also located.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When an ordinary person enters a room and becomes strongly influenced by the activities within, it is due to the inner fire intensifying their energy. If one does not connect with this inner aspect or combine with the yin energy, then their essence does not leak. However, once there is a connection with the inner nature and interaction with yin, the fires of the triple burner (san jiao) above and below will converge and descend, allowing the openings of the body&#39;s original source to fully activate. The nourishing essence will all flow toward the yin organs to be released, and thus the kidneys cannot retain it. </p>
<p>If such a person possesses strong original essence, then the influences of lust cannot disturb them; after prolonged engagement, they remain unspent, much less so in dreams. Even if the inner fire stirs and leads to nocturnal dreams, they still do not leak. This is called a person with balanced yin and yang, who experiences no illness. </p>
<p>Today, individuals are born with a fundamentally weak constitution, and compounded by excessive desires, their kidney yin becomes depleted and exhausted. When yin is deficient, the inner fire stirs; the fire connects upwards to the heart, where the sovereign fire reacts to external stimuli and moves. When it moves, the inner fire accumulates and follows along, and although it may not converge, the essence has already strayed from its position, becoming a guest within the yin organs. </p>
<p>During nighttime rest, when the inner fire, which should be conserved, encounters and connects with the internal energies, it combines with the yin energy. Consequently, one sleeps and immediately dreams, leading to dream-induced release.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the kidneys are not deficient, then there will be no nocturnal emissions or dreams. Therefore, in treating this condition, one must primarily focus on the kidneys and liver. Someone may ask: If there is Yin deficiency and the fire moves causing dreams and emissions, and one takes Danxi&#39;s nourishing Yin pills to nourish Yin and lower fire, yet follows the prescription without effect, why is that? The answer is that this does not grasp the true intention of Danxi&#39;s method of nourishing Yin. In fact, the first prescription in &quot;Danxi&#39;s Heart Method&quot; originally considers Kidney Qi pills as the primary remedy for nourishing Yin. Nowadays, some people misunderstand this by using Huanglian and Zhimu as the main ingredients, generally relying on prescriptions like Kanli pills to stabilize the foundation. All of these are cold and draining fire medicines; the bitter cold can severely drain fluids. The kidneys should be supported and not drained; how can this help nourish Yin? Only Xue Lizhai has elucidated what Danxi did not, specifically using Six Flavors Rehmannia to nourish the kidneys and treat nocturnal emissions, which has often proven effective. Even if there is upward fire, water can nourish wood; when water rises, the fire of wood will cease. If there is insufficiency in the spleen and stomach and damp heat flows downward, use the previous pills as the base, decoct and take to supplement central Qi and lift upward.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the heart is overly burdened, unable to govern its directives and instead allowing the fire of the kidneys to take charge, one should primarily use the Pill of Return while also incorporating Gui Pi Decoction. If the fire in the life gate is weak and the primordial essence is depleted, leading to an unregulated jade gate, one should urgently use the Eight Flavor Pill or the Golden Lock Correcting Yuan Pill to strengthen the true yang, ensuring it encompasses the true essence without leaking. This is the general approach. </p>
<p>For those like Zheng Lust, Uncle Lu, and Wu Zhao Mountain, they focus on the kidneys while also addressing the heart and spleen.

If there are white substances resembling sperm that flow down with urination, this is a manifestation of hernia, treated with Long Dan Qi Liver Decoction. </p>
<p>Zhang Zihua stated: issues such as involuntary urination, urinary blockage, impotence, and slippery, white discharges are all forms of hernia in men. In contrast, if a woman experiences blood stagnation, absence of her monthly cycle, heat in the lower back and knees, heavy legs, dry throat, urinary obstruction, and lumps in the lower abdomen—whether fixed or movable, along with protrusion of the front genitalia and anal issues—these are all forms of hernia in women, though women refer to them as &quot;mass&quot; instead of hernia. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Murkiness</h3>
<p>Murkiness can be distinguished into red and white types, and there is a differentiation between essence and fluid. Generally, the red is more associated with heat, while the white has both cold and heat present. Murkiness arising from essence moves in the heart and kidneys; murkiness arising from fluid indicates illness in the bladder, liver, and spleen. </p>
<p>In cases of red murkiness, there may be red-colored urine or blood-tainted urine. If fresh blood is observed, treatment should follow the blood condition guidelines under hematuria. If the urine is yellow-red, it generally indicates a heat-related condition, but it must be accompanied by pain or urgency; only then can it be treated as heat-related murkiness. In other cases, prolonged fatigue or illness, excessive consumption of alcohol and indulgence can deplete true yin, or taking too much cooling medicine can lead to increased redness, decreased quantity, and absence of pain or urgency. This is due to deficiency of water and depletion of fluids and does not relate to red murkiness. The classics state: &quot;When the central qi is insufficient, urination and defecation are altered,&quot; indicating such cases. One should warm and tonify the lower yuan (source of vitality) to facilitate transformation of qi; the water must clear up by itself. It is crucial not to indiscriminately treat all yellow or red urine as a condition of fire.</p>
<p>White murkiness can also be found in urine, where the color is white like washed rice. Overconsumption of fatty, sweet, alcoholic, and spicy foods can lead to murkiness, stemming from internally generated damp-heat. Additionally, heat and dampness from the external environment, influenced by seasonal changes, can also cause murkiness, which is externally derived. However, internally generated cases are more common than those from external sources. In summary, there must be evidence of heat-related symptoms or pathways to diagnose as a fire condition; clearing out the heat will resolve murkiness in all cases.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is turbidity in the essence, it is surely due to the misfiring of the mutual fire, where lust opposes the essence, causing the essence to stray from its position and unable to be contained. This leads to a continuous outflow, overflowing and moving towards the bladder, resulting in painful and cloudy urination, with both clarity and turbidity present, all due to heat. Over time, there may be a descent of spleen energy, where the earth fails to control moisture and the pathway of water is unclear; or the mutual fire may be extinguished, causing the heart and kidneys to be uncoordinated, leading to slippery essence that is not firm, resulting in persistent turbidity. These conditions indicate the absence of heat. For conditions with heat, one should differentiate and clear the heart and kidneys; for those without heat, one should seek to solidify and lift the spleen and kidneys. This encompasses the methods for treating turbidity. </p>
<p>Regarding the condition of painful urination, where small amounts of urine are painful and drip persistently, desiring to expel but unable to do so, and wishing to stop but cannot—that is a complication of turbidity.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms can vary: some may flow like oily liquid, some may emerge like sand or stones causing unbearable pain, some may resemble tendons, and sometimes there may be bloody urine. There is indeed a difference between these symptoms of dysuria and turbidity. Therefore, Mr. Yan identified five types of dysuria: Qi, stone, blood, oily, and labor. Qi dysuria presents as a condition of frequent urination with lingering dribbles; stone dysuria causes pain in the urethra with urination resembling sand or stones that cannot be expelled quickly; oily dysuria manifests as urine that flows like oil; labor dysuria arises from fatigue and may cause pain radiating with qi disturbances; blood dysuria occurs with heat, and in severe cases, may lead to bloody urine. If the nasal tip appears yellow, this indicates difficulty in urination. Generally, these symptoms are caused by the failure of the heart and kidneys to communicate, leading to the accumulation of heat and toxins, or may stem from excessive drinking after labor, or consuming dry and hot foods, or emotional distress—this is what Mr. Yan has comprehensively explained. However, in the initial stages of dysuria, it is invariably due to intense heat without room for discernment. But if one has taken cold and cool remedies for a long time without improvement, or experiences persistent dysuria, with pain and frequent urges subsiding but oily discharge remaining like cloudy fluid, this indicates a sinking of the middle qi and an unstable vital gate.

After a while, if both the pain and the disorder have subsided but the essence and turbidity persist, one should use remedies like Ningxin Gu Shen and consider formulas such as Biyuan Decoction or Tusi Decoction, or Ginseng Pills and Dingzhi Pills. For heart deficiency, remedies like milky drinks should be used.</p>
<p>If the Mingmen is deficient and cold, causing yang energy to be unstable, the essence and turbidity will occasionally appear and be difficult to cure. One must then strengthen and nourish the Mingmen, using prescriptions like Yougui Pills, Yizhi Decoction, Shike An Shen Pills, or Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pills. If the deficiency is not severe but there is slight cold in the organs that is not contained, one should use Bixie Fenqing Drink.</p>
<p>The methods for treating painful urination are generally the same as for treating turbidity. For conditions involving heat, clearing is appropriate; for turbidity, draining is advisable; and for sinking conditions, uplifting is required; for deficiency, nourishment is needed; for instability of yang energy, warming and supporting the Mingmen should be emphasized.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Night Emission</strong></p>
<p>Dream emission and slippery essence, all are ailments resulting from loss of essence. Although the symptoms vary, the underlying cause is the same. The onset of night emission is fundamentally a matter of the heart. The heart serves as the sovereign fire, while the kidney acts as the ministerial fire; when there is movement, the kidney must respond. Therefore, in young individuals with strong desires, whether due to delusive thoughts in the heart or misleading encounters externally, the sovereign fire is agitated above and the ministerial fire blazes below, thus water cannot be contained and essence leaks out. Initially, this leakage may not be taken seriously, but as it recurs two or three times, it gradually becomes unceasing. Eventually, if the essence channel becomes slippery, any slight contact may induce leakage, and one cannot restrain it. At this point, when essence is depleted, yin becomes deficient, and when yin is deficient, there is no vitality, leading to exhaustion and injury, approaching death. </p>
<p>Though the storage of essence resides in the kidneys, its governance lies with the heart; thus, the ebb and flow of essence is entirely at the heart&#39;s command. When a young person first begins to engage with worldly matters, and their essence channel is not yet established, if they value life, they must first cherish their essence. To cherish essence, calming the heart is essential. It is observed that clever and agile individuals often suffer from this ailment, while those who are simple and rustic tend to be free of it. What is the reason for this disparity? It is simply due to the movements and stillness of the heart. This is what young people should understand before falling ill. Once they are afflicted and seek recovery, they must prioritize maintaining a calm heart, and then adjust and regulate according to the symptoms, which will naturally lead to healing. If one is unaware of how to seek the root cause and relies solely on medicine and nourishment, expecting success, such hopes are faint indeed.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a strong and vigorous man, due to prolonged abstinence, experiences a spilling over, this is known as a case of excessive fullness. All such cases are regarded as disorders of seminal emission. The heart governs the spirit, the lungs control qi, the spleen regulates dampness, the liver is responsible for the smooth flow, and the kidneys manage storage. Thus, for all these ailments, each of the five viscera has its role, and therefore the treatment should also seek the underlying cause accordingly. If one is simply overflowing, then what is expelled will naturally leave on its own, and what is generated will naturally come forth; there is no need for concern here.</p>
<p>Emissions that occur during dreams are referred to as nocturnal emissions; those that occur without dreams are called involuntary emissions. Nocturnal emissions may be associated with emotions and heat, as well as deficiency and overflow. Some dreams arise from emotional stirrings. When emotions stir, one should calm the heart; when the essence stirs, one should strengthen the kidneys. Involuntary emissions are primarily due to an inability of kidney energy to retain essence. If the emissions are excessive and accompanied by pain, then this indicates a condition of either red or white turbidity. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence&#39;s smoothness leading to frequent dreams and loss is surely rooted in desirous thoughts, developed from lack of caution, accumulating gradually until it causes the kidney energy to become unstable. The best remedy is Ling Zhu Tu Si Pill; next are Xiao Tu Si Zi Pill and Jin Suo Si Xian Dan, which can also be chosen for use. </p>
<p>When the fire of the heart is not clear and the spirit wavers upwards, essence leaks downwards; if the fire is intense, it is advisable to first clear the heart fire using a decoction of the two yin herbs. If the fire is not too intense, it is best to start with Bai Zi Yang Xin Pill, Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, or similar herbs like Ren Shen Pill and Yuan Zhi Pill to nourish heart energy, and then use Ling Zhu Tu Si Pill to consolidate it. If the fire of mutual movement is easily stirred and the liver and kidneys harbor excessive heat leading to easy discharge, the use of Zhu Du Wan is the most suitable, or other essence-consolidating pills can be administered. However, one must assess the intensity of the fire; those needing purification should first clear the fire.</p>
<p>For those who are fatigued and easily lose essence when mentally taxed, it is essential to nourish the heart and spleen, avoiding the mistake of seeking to clear and lighten. The Shou Pi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction with a reduction of wood fragrant, or using Mi Yuan Decoction, are all appropriate.

<p>Modern approaches to treating leakage often utilize Huangbai (phellodendron) and Zhimu (anemarrhena) as the main ingredients or specifically use formulas like Solid Root Pill and Kanli Pill, ignoring the inherently bitter and cold nature of these substances, which can significantly lead to downward sinking and leaking, especially in those with kidney deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo, Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Stone Lin</strong>  </p>
<p>When a person experiences painful urination with stones of five colors, the pain is intense before urination and slightly relieved after. This condition is known as Stone Lin. It can occur after water exposure or after exposure and then entering water. For treatment, use 3 taels each of Rehmannia, Cornelian cherry, and Alisma; 5 taels each of Poria, almond, Plantago seeds, and Ophiopogon; 1 tael of green salt, 2 taels of Dipsacus, 8 taels of Fox nut, and 3 qian of cinnamon, ground into powder. Form into honey pills, taking 1 tael with boiling water each morning and evening. Within ten days, one will surely be free from the suffering of urinary stones.  </p>
<p>This condition is particularly painful, with a powerful urge to urinate yet being unable to, and when one can urinate, it feels like being cut with a knife. Exhausting all strength to release a stone results in a clang when it hits the water, not dissolving because of the fire in the bladder. This is a different ailment. The stones can appear red, white, yellow, green, or black—this variety arises from the accumulation of water being boiled by fire.  </p>
<p>The effectiveness of this formula lies in not directly treating Stone Lin but rather replenishing the deficiency of kidney water. When water is sufficient, the fire will naturally diminish; when the fire fades, water will transform on its own. There is a profound principle here. If one treats the bladder directly, the qi cannot be released, so how can water be transformed?<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ejaculation in Dreams</p>
<p>The condition of nocturnal emissions often arises in young men who are absorbed in reading, may be stimulated by sight, or may engage in battles of the mind after experiencing release. They may exert themselves in writing for temporary satisfaction, or experience restless nights that lead to indulgence in sensuality, ultimately resulting in overwhelming emotions and a restless spirit. Their self-discipline becomes nonexistent, and the vital gates remain unsealed, frequently causing trouble in youth. </p>
<p>Now, an effective remedy: take eight taels each of reishi (prepared), foxnut, white atractylodes, and Chinese yam; four taels each of cornelian cherry and roasted jujube seeds; three taels each of north five-flavor fruit, ophiopogon, poria, and plantago seeds; and one tael of balloon flower root, grind them into a powder, and form pills with honey. Take one tael daily with hot water, and the condition will be completely cured, preventing its recurrence. </p>
<p>This formula is remarkable for using prepared reishi and Chinese yam as the main ingredients, while employing prepared earth and cornelian cherry as assistants, directly nourishing the yin of the heart and kidneys, and additionally utilizing white atractylodes to bolster the waist. Thus, the essence will not leak externally.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is better to replenish one&#39;s vital energy than to merely recover after experiencing loss, as one will not be in a desperate situation. Why must one supplement the essence only after it is lost? If one does not close the gates of loss, then how can one ensure permanence without the aid of certain remedies? The roots of the plant provide relief to urination and preserve essence if one understands their proper function. </p>
<p>The evidence of nocturnal emissions, if prolonged, will leave the body&#39;s gates unsealed, leading to depletion and death. Often, people resort to stimulating medicines for the essence, which do not offer salvation. If one addresses the issue before it becomes severe, using medicines to replenish essence and energy, one would not reach such a state. </p>
<p>Take one tael each of Euryale seeds and Chinese yam, five qian of lotus seeds, three qian of fried jujube seeds, two qian of Poria, and one qian of ginseng, and decoct them in water for drinking. This formula is called the Preservation of Essence Decoction. After consuming the decoction, add five qian of white sugar, mix well, and consume along with the dregs daily. Do not stop for less than ten days.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Golden Powder</p>
<p>The calamity of impurities arises from the imbalance of the heart and kidneys, water and fire. This can occur due to indulgence in wine and lust, leading to excess, which is referred to as soil indulgence. The heart has empty heat while the kidney is deficient, thus the soil evil affects the water. Historical records have mentioned that in summer, the soil is dry and the water is impure; in winter, the soil is firm and the water is clear—this is the principle behind it. Physicians often prescribe harsh tonics, but this can worsen the condition. This formula harmonizes and is taken to ensure that water and fire are balanced, and thus the soil becomes firm and the flow is clear.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ginseng: 2 taels</li>
<li>Dragon bone (calcined): 1 tael</li>
<li>White poria: 2 taels</li>
<li>Loranthus: 2 taels</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind the above into fine powder. Take one qian (3.1 grams) each time, and mix with rice wine on an empty stomach, taking another dose before sleeping.</p>
<p>Kanli Dan</p>
<p>This balances water and fire, nourishes the heart and kidneys, and stops white discharge and nocturnal emissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sour jujube seed: 1 tael</li>
<li>Cinnabar: 1 tael</li>
<li>Frankincense: 0.5 tael</li>
<li>Aconite: 1 piece (peel off the skin and navel)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind the above into fine powder and mix well. Refine honey to form pills the size of chicken heads. Take five pills each time, with warm wine or lampwick soup. It should be made in the twelfth lunar month and stored in ceramic containers.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sanxian Pills for Treating Dream Emission</strong></p>
<p>Two taels of Yizhi Ren, stir-fried with two taels of salt and then remove the salt; one and a half taels of Wuyao, stir-fried; one tael of Shanyao, ground into powder. Mix the finely ground Shanyao with broth to form pills the size of phoenix seeds. Take fifty pills on an empty stomach before sleeping, washed down with salt water, coated with powdered cinnabar. </p>
<p>For conditions of seminal emission that cannot be controlled, accompanied by spontaneous sweating, dizziness, extreme weakness, or alternating chills and fever, if tonic herbs are ineffective, and the pulse is floating, soft, and scattered, it is not merely deficiency, nor is it simply due to excessive indulgence in sexual activities. The cause is the heart&#39;s perceptions, leading to desire and joy in the mind, which stirs up intentions that do not align with one’s will, resulting in this illness. If the medicine does not work to replenish and strengthen, what else can be done? It is because when the heart has attachments, the spirit cannot return; when the mind has desires, the will cannot settle. </p>
<p>First, harmonize the Defensive and Nutritive Qi; when these are harmonious, the heart will be at peace. Next, regulate the Spleen; when the Spleen&#39;s energy is harmonious, the will can stabilize. When the heart and kidneys interact intimately, the spirit within guards itself, and the illness will heal naturally. </p>
<p>For this, use three qian of Ren Shen and one qian of Dang Gui, wash and fry them into powder, and make three doses mixed with glutinous rice drink. After taking this, spontaneous sweating will stop, and chill and heat will retreat. If dizziness persists, use three qian of Chuan Xiong and one qian of Ren Shen, fry into powder and make three doses mixed with boiling water. After taking this, dizziness will resolve. </p>
<p>For those with uncontrolled emissions, use half a tael of Bai Shao, and three qian each of Ding Xiang and Mu Xiang, ground to a fine powder. Each dose should be taken with five slices of fresh ginger and two dates, boiled together in water. Taken on an empty stomach, this will calm the heart, settle the spirit, strengthen the essence, and bring joy to the spirit.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

<p>Wash and clean the seeds of the gold cherry fruit, steam them until cooked, and pour broth over them. Extract the juice into a silver basin and simmer slowly until it becomes a thin paste.

Take thirty pills with warm wine before meals. An alternative method uses milk pills taken with salty broth. </p>
<p>The Rehmannia Pill treats the imbalance of water and fire in the heart and kidneys, which may be exacerbated by indulgence in wine and lust, termed &quot;earthly indulgence.&quot; This occurs because of excessive heat in the spleen and insufficient energy in the kidneys, resulting in the earth disrupting the water; wise sages often say that in summer, the earth is dry and the water turbid, while in winter, the earth is solid and the water clear, which reflects this principle. Doctors often prescribe harsh tonics, but this may worsen the condition. This formula harmonizes the balance of water and fire, allowing the earth to stabilize and the flow to clear. </p>
<p>Ingredients: ten taels of prepared rehmannia, steamed and sun-dried nine times; one tael of prepared aconite, removing the skin and navel; five taels each of dodder seed, dried after soaking in wine, and antler frost; three taels each of white poria and arborvitae seed. </p>

<p>For bleeding and heart disturbance: Mix shiyanzi (stone swallow), shanglu, red bean, and safflower into a powder. Take one qian with scallion white soup.</p>

<p>Labor dysuria results from weakness and fatigue; symptoms include inability to urinate and urgent pain in the lower abdomen. Take a decoction of perilla seed powder. After urinating, one must take restorative pills or powder.</p>
<p>For inability to urinate, accompanied by a small amount of blood and urgent pain, this is blood dysuria; reddish-yellow urine and sharp pain below the navel indicate heat dysuria; both should be treated with cold water.</p>
<p>For qi dysuria with fullness and urgency in the lower abdomen, and frequent residual dribbling after urination, take a decoction of mutong (bladderpod). For stone dysuria with internal pain and inability to urinate, leading to urgent pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, and urination of sand or stones causing distress, first mix the powder, stir it well, and fry between paper until the paper is scorched, then grind it and use warm water to take.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guide</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Canon&quot; states: For the method of nocturnal emission, at the hour of midnight, when yang energy is at its peak, lie on your back, close your eyes and mouth, place your tongue on the upper palate, arch your back, use the middle finger of your left hand to apply pressure on the coccyx point, and use the thumb of your right hand to press down on the base of your ring finger, forming a fist. Stretch both legs out fully, curl your toes inward, inhale deeply, and visualize the energy traveling from the spine to the back of the head, then reaching the crown of the head, and slowly descending down to the lower dantian. Only then can you gently lower your waist, legs, and hands, and proceed as before. If the yang energy has weakened, repeat this two or three times as you did initially. If the yang energy has not yet matured, it is acceptable to force it to rise. The reason people experience weakness is due to youthful desires being too strong, excessive sexual activity, and the imbalance between water and fire, leading to such ailments.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one can practice this method, not only will the disease of seminal leakage quickly be resolved, but over time the kidney essence will rise, and the heart fire will descend, thus balancing water and fire, leading to a state free from illness. </p>
<p>Additionally, the method for preventing involuntary seminal release involves using a short and narrow bed, lying in a bow-like position with both knees drawn toward the navel and choosing to sleep on either the left or right side. One should hold the scrotum with one hand and press the lower abdomen with the other, ensuring a calm and quiet state while avoiding thoughts of sexual desire. By preventing seminal leakage, one can preserve health.</p>
<p>Another method involves lying on one&#39;s side and, during the hours between dog and pig (between 7 PM and 9 AM), using one hand to support the external kidneys and employing both hands to rub the area below the navel eighty-one times, then switching hands, repeating nine times. This practice for nine days should yield results, with success seen by the eighty-first day.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rituals of Serving Parents&quot; states: A man from Dai passed through Xi City, where a young man suffered from schistosomiasis. The man from Dai instructed him to eat salted fish, and soon he became very thirsty; then the man from Dai allowed him to drink as much water as he wanted, and afterward treated the schistosomiasis with medicine, which immediately relieved his symptoms. The patient experienced difficulty with urination, hence the condition worsened.</p>
<p>The son of a liquor monitor, a kind-hearted boy of thirteen, had been suffering from sand-stone schistosomiasis for nine years. Initially, due to residual toxins from a rash, he experienced bloody stools. Someone advised him to take Taibai Powder, which provided some relief. However, due to the accumulation of heat that did not subside, he developed a blockage, which caused him to hallucinate, crying out and alarming the neighbors. </p>
<p>The man from Dai diagnosed him, concluding that previous physicians incorrectly attributed the illness to the kidneys and small intestines. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that the Liver channel of the Foot Jueyin relates to issues with urination and blockages. A blockage refers to the inability to urinate, while schistosomiasis is a kind of dripping. This is a disease related to the Wood element, not the small intestine nor the kidneys. The Wood element is suppressed, and Fire comes to overtake it, leading to heat accumulation in the bladder, which constricts and forms sand and stones, similar to a cooking pot simmering for an extended period, turning the water into alkaline residue. </p>
<p>As for the bladder of sheep and pigs, when inflated with air, it cannot release anything; how can there truly be sand and stones that can leak? Thus, it is understood that what previous physicians described about taking Wushi Pills to resolve the issue may not be completely accurate. The classic text states: When Wood is obstructed, it must be addressed first with Gua Ti Powder to unblock it, and then followed by Ba Zheng Powder mixed with alkaline water in equal parts, to be consumed in sips, allowing the sand and stones to dissolve and pass.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The young boy of the Zhang family from Qucun is fourteen years old and has been ill for about a year and a half. The illness began in the wheat harvest season, manifesting as severe abdominal pain with spasms, leading him to grip his abdomen, jump, twist, and cry out without ceasing. He experienced a few days of difficulty urinating, only managing to do so in small amounts resembling sand and stones, while his bowel movements were severely constipated, causing his rectum to protrude one to two inches. Many doctors were unable to cure him, so he was carried by his father to seek the help of a healer. The healer stated: &quot;Today&#39;s treatment will yield results today.&quot; It was around the hour of Chen and Si. </p>
<p>Using a formula to regulate the stomach and relieve heat, with a mere one or two taels, he added three qian of cowherb root powder, boiled it in river water, and instructed him to swallow it three to five times. He also took a bitter powder in the form of sixty tiny pills the size of mustard seeds. After these treatments, he experienced a rush of vomiting and diarrhea all at once, with pus and blood expelled. Once the purging settled, he was instructed to drink a large bowl of freshly drawn water, which immediately aided his urination one or two times. That night, he drank fresh water twenty to thirty times, and nearly all of his illness was alleviated, with only one instance of crying remaining. </p>
<p>The next day, he lay down as if drunk, from morning until dusk, and suddenly got up to run about, seeking food, laughing and singing with his mother, finally free from his suffering. He then followed this with prescriptions like Taibai powder and Bazheng powder, adjusting his treatment over one day, leading to a complete recovery. Concerned that he might lose the nourishment during the hot weather, he returned after five days. The healer remarked: &quot;This was a blockage in the lower yang. If there was no vomiting or bowel movement, how could the lower yang be opened? If one does not drink water, how can urination improve? Generally speaking, if the source is clean, then the flow will be clear.&quot;<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

Local doctors were unable to treat him, and he had visited the capital city seeking help, but most remedies had only weakened him.

Furthermore, it states: &quot;The generation of Yin is fundamentally linked to the Five Flavors; the injury to Yin organs is also linked to the Five Flavors.&quot; The body&#39;s desire for the Five Flavors must be moderated; one should not indulge excessively.

Daohong San can treat the fire and lead to recovery. From this, we understand that anyone experiencing heat-related emissions is suffering from a heat disorder.</p>
<p>A young man who has nocturnal emissions with a creamy discharge feels a rush of gas in his lower abdomen. He experiences daily heat in the lower back, with cold hands and feet when the heat arises. When the heat subsides, his hands and feet feel warm. If he frequently suffers from gas and belching, and experiences recurrent emissions every ten days or so, his pulse will be strong and slippery. I recognize that he has stagnation. First, I prescribed the Shenchang Hezhong Pill in a strong dose. Then, I used a modified version of the Eight Medicinal Herbs Decoction, taking it with 100 pills of Zishen Wan. If he took this with slightly stronger herbs like clam powder, the emissions and discharge would worsen, with potentially two emissions in a night. Thus, I switched to a large dosage of Daohong San boiled into a decoction for him to take, stopping both the emissions and discharge gradually.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man experiencing nocturnal emissions had been given strong herbs and continued to have emissions for several nights. I foolishly started with Shenqiong Wan in a large dose to expel the symptoms, but then opted for a recipe for Zhu Ling Wan. Both resulted in recovery.</p>

When he came for a consultation at year’s end, I noted that his pulse was weak and measured two inches; this indicated excess internal heat caused by deficiency. Traditionally, doctors focused solely on alleviating pain, which led to deeper deficiency—the more they cleared, the more deficiency they induced, resulting in intensified internal heat.</p>
<p>I then prescribed Bawei Dihuang Pills along with treatments like Plantago, agarwood, and ginseng in eight doses. The pain reduced slightly, yet it remained frequent. A former physician suggested that the painful urination stemmed from true internal heat, warning that excessive warming could risk his health severely in days to come. Unless he expressed doubts, we could discuss further. I responded: &quot;If warming isn&#39;t advisable, then after taking the medicine, his condition must worsen. Now it has already lessened, what more is there to doubt?&quot;</p>
<p>He took Buzhong Yiqi Decoction in the morning and Bawei Pills in the evening, and after a month, nine-tenths of his illness had vanished. He then doubled the use of ginseng and astragalus, and in fourteen days, he was completely recovered.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

Suddenly, he noticed some white droplets after urination and believed himself to be suffering from a deficiency, refusing treatment. For three months, though he did not urinate, he often experienced emissions, feeling dizziness in his head. The physician treated him with tonics to consolidate essence and stop leakage for two months, with little effect. When I examined him, I found his six pulses to be slippery and swollen. This was due to the damp heat from alcohol depleting his essence. Therefore, I prescribed a mixture of Atractylodes, Poria, Tangerine peel, Licorice, Kudzu root, and White Cardamom, with a small amount of Berberine. After two doses, he showed improvement; within ten days, he recovered to normal.</p>

I observed that long-term leakage of essence was already harmful, especially combined with mental strain, where water and fire did not blend harmoniously. I used a decoction with Rhizoma Dioscoreae to clear dampness, along with Poria, Polygala, Cinnamon, and Coptis. After four doses, he showed improvement; I later prescribed Revitalize the Spleen and Boost Qi pills, along with Six-Ingredient Rejuvenation Pills. After half a month, he was stable.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: Zheng Xian&#39;s son, at the age of sixteen, developed a disease resembling dysuria seven months after birth. He experienced painful attacks every five to seven days, with urine resembling lacquer and millet. The pulse was light but choppy, heavy but wiry; he appeared emaciated and long, with a blue and sallow complexion. It was believed this was due to his father taking hot medicine, which left residual heat in the womb and affected the son&#39;s life gate. Thus, a remedy was prepared using purple snow mixed with yellow bile powder, formed into pills the size of wutong seeds, dried, and taken with hot soup—first a hundred pills, and after half a day, another two hundred. Food was pressed down on them. After another half day, intense pain spread from the waist to the abdomen; the urine then flowed, appearing like lacquer and millet, filling a bowl, and the pain reduced by eight-tenths. He was later given an ounce of dried tangerine peel, half an ounce each of Platycodon and Akebia, followed by a dosage of about a handful, which brought stability. If the father suffered from dryness and heat yet could affect the child, what could be said of the mother who was afflicted?</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Connection&quot; mentions: I treated Zheng Lushu, over twenty years old, who was studying for the imperial examination. He could not sleep through the fourth watch and fell ill. While in bed, his penis touched the quilt and leg, leading him to dream of sexual relations and losing semen; when it was suspended in the air, he did not dream. His appetite decreased daily, and he felt fatigued and breathless. This was due to excessive mental strain; both fire elements became heightened, preventing sleep at night, blood could not return to the liver, and kidney water was insufficient. The fire consumed the yin, thereby intruding into the lower region and disturbing the storage of essence, causing it to flee. The contact with the quilt further obstructed his vital energy, leading to dreams of intimacy. Consequently, I boosted the heart to calm the spirit, adjusted the spleen and stomach to raise yang, and applied tonics to nourish essence, generate yin, and consolidate yang. In less than three months, he returned to good health.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the past, there was a practitioner in Wu Zhao Mountain who understood the method for treating nocturnal emissions. He treated a man who, after becoming ill, overworked his mind and thus developed the problem of dreaming of emissions. The man was thin and phlegmatic, and various doctors prescribed a cleansing heart with lotus seed drink, which was ineffective over time. Upon diagnosing his pulse as tight and rough, I realized that the use of cold and diuretic medicine was excessive, resulting in the decline of kidney energy, which would worsen his condition. I employed a method of elevation, raising the water of Kan to assist the fire of Li, reducing Yang energy while nourishing Yin blood. Then, I used deer antler glue and human milk to replenish essence and blood. In less than a month, he was cured. </p>
<p>I reflected on the multiple causes of nocturnal emissions, which make treatment difficult. Some are caused by excessive mental heat leading to leakage, while others result from overconsumption of cold diuretic medicines like Ophiopogon, Poria, Plantago, Anemarrhena, and Coptis, which also lead to leakage. There are also cases of prolonged leakage without closure at the Yumen (Jade Gate). For treatment, those with excessive heat should clear the heart and diminish fire; those affected by cold and diuretic medicines should warm and tonify the lower origin; and those with declining kidney energy should elevate and retrieve energy, allowing the water and fire to interact so that Kan and Li can stabilize naturally.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

[Note: When the Yin condenses externally, the Yang is constrained internally, hence the people suffer from yellow urination and dripping-related symptoms.] **Treatise on Vital Energy Communication to Heaven** Yin is that which stores essence while arising urgently. Yang is that which defends the exterior and solidifies. External winds invade with excessive sexual energy, resulting in the loss of essence and harming the liver. [Note: Wind is a Yang evil, invading the surface and thus injuring Qi. If the Yang energy is harmed, the cold Yin essence is released.

Therefore, the five organs, which govern the storage of essence, must not be harmed; if harmed, they will lose control and become Yin deficient. In a state of Yin deficiency, there is no Qi, and without Qi, there is death. [Note: Fear injures the kidneys, thus unresolved fear harms the essence in the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones, hence when the essence is harmed, the bones weaken and wither. The essence tends to descend when the organ Qi is harmed and cannot store anymore.

The chapter on Strangury states: The condition of strangury is such that the urine appears like grains of millet, with a tense lower abdomen and pain radiating to the navel. Those suffering from strangury should not induce sweating, as it will result in blood in the urine. **Loss of Essence** The chapter on Blood Stasis states: The condition due to overexertion manifests as a floating and large pulse, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet. Symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and improve in autumn and winter. Cold yin can lead to spontaneous loss of essence, with sourness and debilitation impeding circulation. In men, the pulse is floating, weak, and hesitant, indicating infertility with cool essence. For those suffering loss of essence, there are tense sensations in the lower abdomen, coldness in the lower Yin, dizziness, and hair loss. A very weak, hollow, and slow pulse indicates the absence of essence and blood. If the pulse is slightly floating but with a tight feeling, it indicates loss of essence in men and dreams of intercourse in women, which should be treated with Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Decoction. A pulse that is tense and large indicates reduction, while a large pulse suggests emptiness; reduction suggests coldness, while emptiness suggests deficiency. When deficiency and coldness combine, it is termed \"transformative disorder.\" For women, there may be excessive vaginal discharge, and for men, loss of blood and essence.

Factors such as excessive heat in the stomach from drinking alcohol, becoming overly intoxicated during intimate acts, exhausting one's spirit, and damaging blood energy can contribute to this condition. Sometimes, it may be due to excitement leading to depleted essence, or indulgence causing the true fluids to be frequently lost. Additionally, anxiety and worry can disturb this process, improper timing with hunger or fullness can result in complications, and excessive movement or holding back urination can lead to issues. Cold may invade the bladder, prolonged outburst may cause retention, and heat in the bladder can injure one's balance, thereby resulting in this affliction.

It is said that if urination is painful and does not flow, it is due to heat; if there is involuntary urination, it is due to cold. One must understand that severe heat invades the kidney area, becoming dry from the foot's jueyin channel, where the blockage is extreme, and thus the qi and blood cannot circulate. This leads to weakness and lack of function, causing fluids to seep into the bladder, resulting in loss of control over urination. The classics say: the eye requires blood to see, the ear requires blood to hear, the hand requires blood to grasp, the palm requires blood to grip, the foot requires blood to walk, the organs require blood for fluids, and the bowels require blood for qi. Blood travels with qi; when qi and blood circulate smoothly, the spirit will become clear and its functions will be used. Furthermore, blood and qi are the spirit of a person and should be carefully nurtured. Therefore, all activities should be practiced regularly to ensure smooth circulation of qi and blood, allowing for functionality; if obstructed, the flow will be weak and the way will not be effective, hence leading to deterioration. If the illness is extremely heated, it will cause blockage, preventing the circulation of qi and blood, leading the spirit to lack functionality and inhibiting its natural processes, dependent on the severity of the blockage."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"Therefore, when the eyes are obstructed, one cannot see colors; when the ears are obstructed, one cannot hear sounds; when the nose is obstructed, one cannot smell fragrances or odors; when the tongue is obstructed, one cannot discern flavors. As for muscle weakness and joint pain, when one cannot use their limbs, it is all caused by excessive heat and stagnation. Hence, Zhang Zhongjing explains in his discussion of lesser yin disease with extreme heat that symptoms such as urination and defecation loss, wild talk, and the eyes unable to see straight are first signs of kidney exhaustion. The \"Spiritual Pivot\" states: the kidneys govern the two yin. Therefore, when water is deficient and weak, and heat stagnates in that area, the two yin become blocked, leading to weakness, numbness, and the spirit having no use, which results in loss of urination and defecation that cannot be controlled. This proves heat is present. Thus, although ancient prescriptions say it is a case of cold heat, they only use cold medicines like elm bark, Huangqin, Qumai, Fuling, Tongcao, Jisuo, (wooded) plum seed, and Zhi Zi to treat it. Although the theory may seem irrational, the formula indeed has merit. Due to not understanding the mechanisms of qi's movement and changes, it is reasonable that some may recognize it as incorrect. Some suggest that patients with urethritis recover by taking caraway, Yizhi, talc, or warming alcohol, thinking this implies coldness. Little do they know that these are key medicines to promote urination. While the nature of warming alcohol and Yizhi is hot, caraway is warm, and talc is cold, these can dissipate stagnation, allowing qi and fluids to circulate, leading to heat dispersal and recovery.

To resolve heat and promote urination, one should use substances like gardenia fruit. Take one he (a unit of measurement) of peeled gardenia and consume it with white broth. Dysuria refers to the condition where the urine dribbles, with a sense of urgency to urinate but inability to do so; it comes and goes, all as a result of heat. The causes of dysuria stem from kidney deficiency leading to heat in the bladder. When water and fire do not interact, the heart and kidneys become stagnant, causing disharmony between yin and yang, leading to the mixing of clarity and turbidity, and storage in the lower body. This results in a sudden urge from the bladder, along with mucus, blood, sand, and stones excreting through the urinary passage, thus manifesting as a feeling of urgency without relief, and worse, a blockage in between that can lead to severe discomfort. In general, when the small intestine has gas, the urine becomes distended; when it has blood, the urine becomes thick; when it has heat, the urine becomes painful. Painful urination constitutes blood dysuria, while painless urination refers to blood in the urine. If there are remnants of sperm blockage, it results in sand; if sperm disperses, it leads to mucus; if there are stones, they result from heavy substances in the urine. Thick, frequent urination suggests gas. Understanding the fundamental causes helps classify them accordingly. The method of treatment involves using agents that dispel stagnant gas, promote urination, and clear away evil heat, which also aids in balancing heart fire. When the heart is clear, urination will naturally become smooth; when the heart is balanced, blood will not flow indiscriminately. It is vital to avoid using tonics for qi, as that may alleviate pressure but increase distension; tonics for blood may worsen thickening; and tonics for heat will further intensify it.

Additionally, when there is obstruction in the womb system, this should not be overlooked. An obstruction manifests as acute pain below the navel and difficulty in urination. Resisting the urge to urinate, whether upon sudden urgency, or while being full from food, riding a horse while needing to urinate, or holding it in while entering a bedroom, causes the water qi to reverse upward, pressuring the womb, preventing it from relaxing. If the womb collapses, it leads to demise. Anuria (li) refers to obstruction; failing to pass urine results in anuria, while incontinence is classified as leakage. Dribbling, painful urination is referred to as lin, while urgent, distended, and obstructed urination is called bi. It is advisable to use Wuling San or Dengxin Decoction for treatment.

The lesser yang creates a second Qi, where wind and fire become trapped above, causing heat and diseases like painful urination. It explains that the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians are interconnected, which is why the greater yang governs the surface of the body. When it rises, it commands all Yang Qi, and when it descends, it enters the bladder. Additionally, the lungs regulate the flow of fluids and send them to the bladder. The spleen and stomach digest water and grains; if there is heat, then all liquids become hot, and as they are transported downward, the bladder receives them as heated. The small intestine is linked to the heart and is responsible for heat. Its fluids seep into the bladder, and if heat manifests in the heart, the small intestine must also be hot. The bladder then heats from this, leading to symptoms like blood in the urine. This indicates that the initial heat pathogen is varied, but they all eventually transfer to the bladder, causing painful urination.

The author reflects on how painful urination is primarily caused by severe heat leading to dampness, which, in turn, causes fluids to become turbid, coagulating into painful urination. Moreover, those who excessively consume medicinal minerals or engage in sexual activity may cause seminal fluid to flow into the bladder, contributing to the issue, as can the accumulation of phlegm and food. There’s an example of a child who, while in the womb, suffered from the residual toxins of medicinal minerals taken for a long time, developing painful urination for fifteen years, which was cured with a remedy. The essential point is that one cannot effectively treat an illness without addressing its root cause."},{"anchor":"trans-49p","marker":"49p","type":"translation","text":"**Red and White Turbidity** The path of urine differs from that of essence: gonorrhea pertains to the pathway of urine, which is why it is classified under the liver and gallbladder sections in the \"Compendium\"; turbidity pertains to the essence pathway, hence it is classified under the kidney and bladder sections. Those suffering from turbidity may experience severe pain in the urethra like being cut by a knife or burned by fire during urination, yet the urine itself remains clear. Only at the opening might there be refuse, such as pus from sores or eye discharge, trickling continuously, initially not mixed with urination, much like the flow in a river, making it easy to distinguish. Often, I have seen physicians treat it as gonorrhea, using Wu Ling and Ba Zheng formulas, continuously mixing them, yet this exacerbates the condition countless times; I have often corrected this but found it difficult to make this known widely. This is mostly due to the degradation and corruption of essence in nine out of ten cases, while only one out of ten arises from damp heat and deficiency."},{"anchor":"trans-50p","marker":"50p","type":"translation","text":"**Night Emission** Danxi's writings divide dream emissions and fluid emissions into two categories. Dream emissions occur through interactions with spirits during dreams, while fluid emissions that do not originate from dreams are referred to as fluid emissions. Nevertheless, both are ultimately classified as nocturnal emissions. The treatment methods are the same, hence they are grouped together. If one asks what causes fluid emissions, it is said: The \"Golden Coffer's Essentials\" states that diseases of deficiency and exertion are characterized by a floating, strong pulse, restlessness in the hands and feet, and coldness with the essence leaking out. It also states that when the pulse is wiry and strong, it is termed \"leather,\" signifying the loss of blood and essence. Furthermore, when the lower abdomen feels tense and the external genitalia are cold, the pulse is slightly tightening, which indicates a loss of essence in men and dream interactions in women. According to Tong's \"Sources of Illness,\" the diseases of deficiency and exertion are classified into categories such as Five Exertions, Seven Injuries, Six Extremes, and Twenty-Three Steams, with the connection of essence noted among the Seven Injuries. Originally written as \"essence connections,\" it is altered here based on the \"Discussion of Disease Sources\" referencing deficiency-related conditions. The steaming condition termed \"jade chamber steaming,\" in men results in leaking essence, alongside other symptoms of essence loss, all of which are mixed within the category of deficiency diseases. Since the kidneys are responsible for storing essence, all are regarded as diseases resulting from weakened kidney energy, implying no damage to other organs. Is it truly so? All five organs are involved in essence storage. Upon examining the \"Spiritual Pivot,\" it first states that what heaven represents in me is virtue. What the earth represents in me is energy; virtue flows and energy thins, thus leading to life. Therefore, the essence that derives from this is called \"essence,\" and the mingling of two essences is termed \"spirit.\" Thus, it can be said that this governs and commands the spirit of the entire body."},{"anchor":"trans-51p","marker":"51p","type":"translation","text":"The heart and kidneys are the organs of water and fire, embodying the principles of how heaven and earth transform and generate. Therefore, the storage of spirit is the fundamental source of the five organs. Next, the way to engage with things is called the heart. The heart's memories are referred to as intention; intention, when anchored, is called will. From will stems change, known as thought; from thought comes longing, known as concern; and from concern arises interaction with the world, called wisdom. All of these arise from the heart's spirit responding to external stimuli, which is known as the five intentions, giving rise to the designation of the five spiritual organs. Once the five spirits are differentiated, they each govern their respective functions related to virtue, governance, and nature. Thus, the water and fire of the heart and kidneys conform to the ranks of the five spirits. However, the principal spirit they govern remains concurrent and has never been separate; while the five spirits and five changes are categorized, the essence also transforms according to the spirit, integrating wherever it goes. Therefore, each of the five organs must harbor its spirit to fulfill its function, which is called the true essence of the organs. This represents the vitality of the primary energy. If the true essence of any organ is not properly aligned, then disease in that organ will arise. If the spirit of one organ is significantly harmed, it will inevitably damage the primary spirit governing the heart and kidneys. For instance, excessive anxiety and overthinking harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to unchecked desire. Joy and fear also damage essence; when essence is harmed, bones weaken, leading to decay and paralysis. Those who govern essence must not be harmed; if harmed, they will lose their hold and become yin deficient. When yin is deficient, energy is depleted, and without energy, death ensues."},{"anchor":"trans-52p","marker":"52p","type":"translation","text":"In this way, when the spirit resides in the five organs, if injured, then indulgence and evils will arise. The heart, in its will, is associated with joy; in its energy, it represents fire and heat. The kidneys, in their will, relate to fear; in their energy, they signify water and cold. Thus, excessive fright and worry can harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fire stirs incessantly. When fire stirs incessantly, the water of the kidneys is overwhelmed by fear. Fear, if not resolved, stirs within, causing injury to the kidneys. The kidneys govern the storage of essence, and the essence received from the five organs and six bowels cannot be retained and will descend in excess. This is said in relation to the heart and kidneys, which control the spirit. As for the essence of the other organs, do they all leak out? The text from the \"Inner Canon\" states that endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to excessive indulgence, loosening the reproductive muscles, which results in white indulgence, and its ailment is muscular atrophy. Muscular atrophy arises within the liver. The commentary indicates that white indulgence refers to a discharge resembling essence, flowing downwards in urine. Although it is said to resemble essence, it is likely not the essence that has transformed but consists of that which has not yet fully formed. Why is this stated? There are two types of essence: the innate essence that one is born with; and that which is derived from food and air entering the stomach, dispersing essence throughout the five organs. There is also the essence derived from water and drink, transmitted from the spleen and lungs to the kidneys, spreading throughout the body; this is the daily essence produced from food. All the daily-produced essence is transformed from the original innate essence, which is then distributed. When the organs become full and overflow, they send it to the kidneys, which are the source of original vital energy—the root of generation, serving as the path for nourishment that begins and ends in transformation."},{"anchor":"trans-53p","marker":"53p","type":"translation","text":"If the essence of food encounters a disease in a zang organ, then the taste and transformation of the food in that organ will be incomplete, and it cannot enter to be stored with the original essence; instead, it will be leaked out. As for the case where the spleen transfers heat to the kidney, resulting in pain in the lower abdomen and the emission of a white substance, the principle is the same. Although Wang's commentary states that it dissipates fat and burns flesh, might it not be the essence stored in the kidney that is being consumed? If both organs are disease-free, would this white substance not be the essence? If both organs are diseased, would not the stored essence transform into this white substance and be expelled? Using this as a comparison, should the essence of the lungs and spleen not also be at risk of being lost due to the disturbance of the liver, leading to the essence being violated and leaking? Therefore, how should we treat this? The answer is: for leakage originating solely from the kidney, treat the kidney. If it is caused by issues in other organs leading to kidney leakage, then treat both. If it leaks from other organs, treat the primary organ in question, and one must carefully assess the four categories to seek treatment. Generally, if the essence leaks from the heart, the blood vessels become empty and fail to regulate. If it leaks from the lungs, the skin and hair become dry and coarse, leading to shortness of breath and discomfort. If it leaks from the spleen, the complexion turns yellow, the flesh deteriorates, and the limbs become weak. If it leaks from the liver, the color turns greenish, leading to weakness in the muscles. If it leaks from the kidney, the complexion turns yellow-black, the marrow is depleted, and the bones become weak; this can also be discerned from the pulse. Someone might ask about the principles of dreaming at night and engaging in intimate interactions. The answer is: \"The Inner Canon\" states that the kidneys govern water and receive the essence of the five zang organs and the six fu organs to store it. It also states that it governs the hidden and is the root of storage; it is where the essence resides. Furthermore, it mentions the crucial balance of yin and yang: if yang is strong but not dense, then yin energy will be cut off."},{"anchor":"trans-54p","marker":"54p","type":"translation","text":"Yin and yang are secret yet balanced; when they are harmonized, the spirit is well-regulated. When yin and yang are separated, the essence and energy are void. It is said that yin and yang meet in the meeting point of the governing vessels at the energetic street. In the “Spiritual Pivot,” the chapter on the disturbance of dreams states: When the qi resides in the yin organ, dreams connect to the inner world. The yin organ is where the source vessels are linked, and the channels of the Foot Taiyin, Yangming, Shaoyin, and Jueyin all gather there, converging with the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians. Since Jueyin governs the vessels, all these vessels fall under its authority. The kidneys represent yin and store essence, while the liver represents yang and regulates the flow. The yin organ is the channel for releasing essence; therefore, when the yin of the kidney is deficient, essence cannot be stored, and when the yang of the liver is strong, energy cannot be anchored. If confronted by an external yin disturbance in this channel, it interacts with the excessive yang, causing essence to escape and leading to dreams. The so-called strong yang does not refer to the true yang of the organs, but rather the excess fire residing in the liver. Water is yin, and fire is yang; thus generally, fire is considered yang, but when specified, it can represent two aspects. If fire excessively persists, it will consume the true yang of the organs. The liver is where the soul resides; if the true yang of the organs is deficient, the wandering soul will transform, resulting in dreams, much like those who are ill with a deficiency of the liver experiencing frequent dreams of deceased individuals. When asked, \"As you say, does dream-related emission come from the liver and kidneys?\" the response is, \"Not necessarily. At the onset of illness, it can arise not from the kidneys or liver, but from deficiencies in the heart, lungs, spleen, or stomach.\""},{"anchor":"trans-55p","marker":"55p","type":"translation","text":"It must be transmitted through the liver and kidneys before the essence can move. This is fundamentally based on a natural principle of mutual transmission. Why is this so? The essence of the sinews is connected to the chest and abdomen above, encircles the navel, and joins the transverse bone below. Therefore, the Inner Classic states that it is the meeting point of yin and yang, where qi converges, governing the binding of bones and facilitating mechanisms. All five viscera possess fire, and the fire that resides in the liver is particularly significant; if it is harmonized, it generates beneficial effects, but if it is not, it causes harm, notably more than other forms of fire. Thus, the vigorous liver qi in an average person fills the sinews and serves as the root of abundance. The yin organs, gathering at the sinews, are thus strong in function, all empowered by the essence of mutual fire. If they encounter the inward connection to yin qi, then the fires of the three burners—both internal and external—converge downward, opening up all the body's original realms, allowing the nourishing essence to gather in the yin organs and surge forth. Is this limited solely to what the kidneys store? It is said that when the qi retreats to the yin organs during dreaming, this qi is also the reverse qi from the yin parts of the body, similar to the inward qi, thus dreams can be seen as the essence escaping from the inward connection. If one continues to think excessively, and the essence has already retreated into the yin organs, then upon lying down, dreams manifest and leakage occurs. However, this dreaming arises due to the deficiency of true yang; thus, after the essence has discharged, its qi cannot be completely restored, leading to physical decline, unlike average people who can recover easily within a short time after inward connection. What should be the treatment method? If the illness arises from other viscera, then treat the initial symptoms of the illness as the root, while the liver and kidney as the points of reference. If the illness arises specifically within the liver and kidneys, then treat only the liver and kidneys."},{"anchor":"trans-56p","marker":"56p","type":"translation","text":"When yin and yang are separate and water and fire do not communicate, then it is the state of completion.

Fire can be treated properly or improperly, adjusted in quantity according to what is beneficial. The classics say: Endless thoughts lead to unfulfilled desires, indulging in fantasies and excessive activities result in loosened tendons and cause issues like nocturnal emissions. The teachings of the ancients consist of five methods: First, using cinnabar, magnetite, dragon bone, etc., to stabilize the wandering spirit—this includes secret elixirs like Hejian’s True Essence Pill and the Eight Immortals Pill. Second, if thoughts coalesce into phlegm and confuse the heart’s pathways, then Scholar Xu recommends pills like Zhu Ling Wan to guide and eliminate phlegm. Third, if thoughts harm Yin, using ancient pearl powder pills, sea gourd's large phoenix marrow pills, and Qingxin pills helps to reduce fire and nourish Yin—Danxi used sea clam powder, indigo, cyperus, yellow bract, and anemarrhena to achieve this. Fourth, if thoughts harm Yang, ingredients like Qianfu deer antler, cistanche, and dodder seed can be used to replenish Yang. Fifth, if both Yin and Yang are deficient, Danxi treats a thin person experiencing cloudy dreams by addressing heart deficiency using pearl powder pills and Dingzhi pills.

I prescribed pearl powder pills and Polyporus pills, which helped to stop the emissions. He ultimately took Purple Snow (a medicinal substance), and the heat in his spine was alleviated. Another man had a flooding pulse and warm waist with emissions; I used a pill of agarwood for him and prescribed Daohong San to treat the fire, resulting in recovery. From this, I understand that all emissions due to body heat are indeed heat-induced. If these are caused by excessive mental strain, it is advisable to use Zhi Yuan pills and a decoction with lotus seeds, adding Wuweizi (Schisandra) for ingestion, alongside Ling Sha Dan. If it is from unfulfilled sexual desire, it is suitable to take Si Qi Decoction with white pills. In severe cases, merely hearing or seeing can lead to emissions, known as \"white lust;\" for this, use Miaoxiang San with Yuhua Bai Dan. Initially, dealing with slippery emissions, I recommended Qingzhou Bai pills coated with cinnabar, which were very effective. If it turns out that the issue is excessive sexual desire, leading to deficiency in the lower source, with emissions being uncontrollable, one should take Zhengyuan Decoction adding oyster powder and meat of Cistanchus, each at half a qian (unit of weight), ingesting Yangqi Dan or Ling Sha Dan, while also using deer antler pills, yam pills, Dodder seeds pills, and Gu Yang pills or similar. However, these medicines are very potent; if improperly used in excess, it will exhaust the yin essence, inflame the strong fire, deplete the marrow and flesh, leading to lasting illness. Users must be cautious! The principle of the medical professional states: When treating those with persistent emissions due to true lack of control, using harsh medications to stop them is ineffective; instead, purging the heart fire is better. If purging heart fire cannot stop it, it is advisable to use upward-raising medicines, adding wind-expelling herbs to stabilize.

The \"strong yang\" referred to here is the fire of the liver and kidney; \"lost yin\" refers to the true yin stored in the kidney. The kidney is yin and is responsible for storing essence; the liver is yang and is responsible for dispersing. Therefore, if the kidney's yin is deficient, essence cannot be stored; if the liver's yang is strong, fire cannot be concealed. With fire that cannot be concealed, like essence that cannot be stored, there will be no dreams; if there are dreams, they will leak out. Someone may ask: Why is it that there are many erotic dreams and not other types? The \"Spiritual Axis\" discusses the phenomenon of dreams induced by chaotic energy affecting yin energy, thus dreams connect internally. The yin organ is the channel for seminal leakage, it governs the genitals, and is related to the Spleen, Stomach, Lesser Yin, and Greater Yin veins, as well as the Conception, Governing, and Penetrating vessels.

If such a person possesses strong original essence, then the influences of lust cannot disturb them; after prolonged engagement, they remain unspent, much less so in dreams. Even if the inner fire stirs and leads to nocturnal dreams, they still do not leak. This is called a person with balanced yin and yang, who experiences no illness. Today, individuals are born with a fundamentally weak constitution, and compounded by excessive desires, their kidney yin becomes depleted and exhausted. When yin is deficient, the inner fire stirs; the fire connects upwards to the heart, where the sovereign fire reacts to external stimuli and moves. When it moves, the inner fire accumulates and follows along, and although it may not converge, the essence has already strayed from its position, becoming a guest within the yin organs.

In cases of red murkiness, there may be red-colored urine or blood-tainted urine. If fresh blood is observed, treatment should follow the blood condition guidelines under hematuria. If the urine is yellow-red, it generally indicates a heat-related condition, but it must be accompanied by pain or urgency; only then can it be treated as heat-related murkiness.

Therefore, in young individuals with strong desires, whether due to delusive thoughts in the heart or misleading encounters externally, the sovereign fire is agitated above and the ministerial fire blazes below, thus water cannot be contained and essence leaks out. Initially, this leakage may not be taken seriously, but as it recurs two or three times, it gradually becomes unceasing. Eventually, if the essence channel becomes slippery, any slight contact may induce leakage, and one cannot restrain it. At this point, when essence is depleted, yin becomes deficient, and when yin is deficient, there is no vitality, leading to exhaustion and injury, approaching death.

All such cases are regarded as disorders of seminal emission. The heart governs the spirit, the lungs control qi, the spleen regulates dampness, the liver is responsible for the smooth flow, and the kidneys manage storage. Thus, for all these ailments, each of the five viscera has its role, and therefore the treatment should also seek the underlying cause accordingly. If one is simply overflowing, then what is expelled will naturally leave on its own, and what is generated will naturally come forth; there is no need for concern here. Emissions that occur during dreams are referred to as nocturnal emissions; those that occur without dreams are called involuntary emissions. Nocturnal emissions may be associated with emotions and heat, as well as deficiency and overflow. Some dreams arise from emotional stirrings. When emotions stir, one should calm the heart; when the essence stirs, one should strengthen the kidneys. Involuntary emissions are primarily due to an inability of kidney energy to retain essence. If the emissions are excessive and accompanied by pain, then this indicates a condition of either red or white turbidity.

When the fire of the heart is not clear and the spirit wavers upwards, essence leaks downwards; if the fire is intense, it is advisable to first clear the heart fire using a decoction of the two yin herbs. If the fire is not too intense, it is best to start with Bai Zi Yang Xin Pill, Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, or similar herbs like Ren Shen Pill and Yuan Zhi Pill to nourish heart energy, and then use Ling Zhu Tu Si Pill to consolidate it. If the fire of mutual movement is easily stirred and the liver and kidneys harbor excessive heat leading to easy discharge, the use of Zhu Du Wan is the most suitable, or other essence-consolidating pills can be administered. However, one must assess the intensity of the fire; those needing purification should first clear the fire. For those who are fatigued and easily lose essence when mentally taxed, it is essential to nourish the heart and spleen, avoiding the mistake of seeking to clear and lighten. The Shou Pi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction with a reduction of wood fragrant, or using Mi Yuan Decoction, are all appropriate.

The Experience Secret True Pill may also be considered. For those experiencing damp heat flowing downward, with fire suppressing the yin leading to leakage, it is advisable to use the Four Ling Powder or formulas like Large and Small Fenqing Decoction. If excessive consumption of cold and cooling medicines results in unstable yang, causing the essence passage to be slippery and leakage to be relentless, one should promptly warm and tonify the spleen and kidneys, using formulas like Five Gentleman Decoction, Longevity Spleen Decoction, Right Return Pill, Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill, or Jiajiaozi Pill.

Modern approaches to treating leakage often utilize Huangbai (phellodendron) and Zhimu (anemarrhena) as the main ingredients or specifically use formulas like Solid Root Pill and Kanli Pill, ignoring the inherently bitter and cold nature of these substances, which can significantly lead to downward sinking and leaking, especially in those with kidney deficiency.

Using such treatments for non-fire slippery leakage is merely detrimental to the kidneys."},{"anchor":"trans-72p","marker":"72p","type":"translation","text":"**Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber** **By Chen Shiduo, Qing Dynasty** **Stone Lin** When a person experiences painful urination with stones of five colors, the pain is intense before urination and slightly relieved after. This condition is known as Stone Lin. It can occur after water exposure or after exposure and then entering water. For treatment, use 3 taels each of Rehmannia, Cornelian cherry, and Alisma; 5 taels each of Poria, almond, Plantago seeds, and Ophiopogon; 1 tael of green salt, 2 taels of Dipsacus, 8 taels of Fox nut, and 3 qian of cinnamon, ground into powder. Form into honey pills, taking 1 tael with boiling water each morning and evening. Within ten days, one will surely be free from the suffering of urinary stones. This condition is particularly painful, with a powerful urge to urinate yet being unable to, and when one can urinate, it feels like being cut with a knife. Exhausting all strength to release a stone results in a clang when it hits the water, not dissolving because of the fire in the bladder. This is a different ailment. The stones can appear red, white, yellow, green, or black—this variety arises from the accumulation of water being boiled by fire. The effectiveness of this formula lies in not directly treating Stone Lin but rather replenishing the deficiency of kidney water. When water is sufficient, the fire will naturally diminish; when the fire fades, water will transform on its own. There is a profound principle here. If one treats the bladder directly, the qi cannot be released, so how can water be transformed?"},{"anchor":"trans-73p","marker":"73p","type":"translation","text":"Ejaculation in Dreams The condition of nocturnal emissions often arises in young men who are absorbed in reading, may be stimulated by sight, or may engage in battles of the mind after experiencing release. They may exert themselves in writing for temporary satisfaction, or experience restless nights that lead to indulgence in sensuality, ultimately resulting in overwhelming emotions and a restless spirit. Their self-discipline becomes nonexistent, and the vital gates remain unsealed, frequently causing trouble in youth. Now, an effective remedy: take eight taels each of reishi (prepared), foxnut, white atractylodes, and Chinese yam; four taels each of cornelian cherry and roasted jujube seeds; three taels each of north five-flavor fruit, ophiopogon, poria, and plantago seeds; and one tael of balloon flower root, grind them into a powder, and form pills with honey. Take one tael daily with hot water, and the condition will be completely cured, preventing its recurrence. This formula is remarkable for using prepared reishi and Chinese yam as the main ingredients, while employing prepared earth and cornelian cherry as assistants, directly nourishing the yin of the heart and kidneys, and additionally utilizing white atractylodes to bolster the waist. Thus, the essence will not leak externally. Moreover, since there are no definite methods to stop nocturnal emissions, stopping them actually leads to greater leakage."},{"anchor":"trans-74p","marker":"74p","type":"translation","text":"It is better to replenish one's vital energy than to merely recover after experiencing loss, as one will not be in a desperate situation. Why must one supplement the essence only after it is lost? If one does not close the gates of loss, then how can one ensure permanence without the aid of certain remedies? The roots of the plant provide relief to urination and preserve essence if one understands their proper function. The evidence of nocturnal emissions, if prolonged, will leave the body's gates unsealed, leading to depletion and death. Often, people resort to stimulating medicines for the essence, which do not offer salvation. If one addresses the issue before it becomes severe, using medicines to replenish essence and energy, one would not reach such a state.

The heart has empty heat while the kidney is deficient, thus the soil evil affects the water. Historical records have mentioned that in summer, the soil is dry and the water is impure; in winter, the soil is firm and the water is clear—this is the principle behind it.

For conditions of seminal emission that cannot be controlled, accompanied by spontaneous sweating, dizziness, extreme weakness, or alternating chills and fever, if tonic herbs are ineffective, and the pulse is floating, soft, and scattered, it is not merely deficiency, nor is it simply due to excessive indulgence in sexual activities. The cause is the heart's perceptions, leading to desire and joy in the mind, which stirs up intentions that do not align with one’s will, resulting in this illness. If the medicine does not work to replenish and strengthen, what else can be done? It is because when the heart has attachments, the spirit cannot return; when the mind has desires, the will cannot settle. First, harmonize the Defensive and Nutritive Qi; when these are harmonious, the heart will be at peace. Next, regulate the Spleen; when the Spleen's energy is harmonious, the will can stabilize. When the heart and kidneys interact intimately, the spirit within guards itself, and the illness will heal naturally.

However, due to the accumulation of heat that did not subside, he developed a blockage, which caused him to hallucinate, crying out and alarming the neighbors. The man from Dai diagnosed him, concluding that previous physicians incorrectly attributed the illness to the kidneys and small intestines. The \"Ling Shu\" states that the Liver channel of the Foot Jueyin relates to issues with urination and blockages. A blockage refers to the inability to urinate, while schistosomiasis is a kind of dripping. This is a disease related to the Wood element, not the small intestine nor the kidneys. The Wood element is suppressed, and Fire comes to overtake it, leading to heat accumulation in the bladder, which constricts and forms sand and stones, similar to a cooking pot simmering for an extended period, turning the water into alkaline residue.

Thus, it is understood that what previous physicians described about taking Wushi Pills to resolve the issue may not be completely accurate.
