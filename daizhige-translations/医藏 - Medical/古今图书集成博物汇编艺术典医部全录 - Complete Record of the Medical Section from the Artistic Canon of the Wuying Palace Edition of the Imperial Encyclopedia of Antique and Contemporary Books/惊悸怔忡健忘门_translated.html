<p><strong>Section on Palpitations and Forgetfulness</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Vital Essence Connecting to the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The yang energy, when refined, nourishes the spirit; when gentle, it nurtures the tendons. If it cannot open and close effectively, and cold energy invades, severe stooping may occur. A sinking pulse indicates a fistula, lingering in the flesh; the nourishing energy becomes thin, leading to feelings of great fear and shock.<br><strong>[Note: The back is associated with yang; if yang is deficient, cold pathogens obstruct the back, causing the body to hunch, as mentioned in the &quot;Jinkui.&quot; This refers to conditions where the back is afflicted. If yang is weak and cannot protect the nourishing blood, pathogens sink into the pulse, forming a fistula, lingering between the flesh. This refers, in the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; to conditions likened to a knife-like swelling. When the energy of the channels becomes thin and weak, it can affect the internal organs and disturb the spirit. The heart governs the pulse; if the spirit is harmed, fear and loss of control result. The liver governs blood, thus its ailments manifest in fear and shock.</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>On the True Words of the Jinkui</strong></p>
<p>The eastern blue color connects to the liver, opens at the eyes, and stores essence in the liver. Such ailments manifest as fear and shock.<br><strong>[Note: In spring, the yang energy rises, leading to conditions appearing as sudden shock due to the surge of energy.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion of the Essential Diagnosis</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>In spring, the encounter with autumn equinox results in constricted tendons and reversed energy, manifesting as coughing. This illness does not heal, causing people to be startled and even weep.<br>[Note: The liver, associated with wood in the east, tends to provoke fright. As the liver stores the soul, an unsettled spirit causes people to cry out.]</p>
<p>In autumn, the encounter with spring equinox continues the illness, making people vigilant and eager to act, yet they rise and forget their intentions.<br>[Note: Autumn tends to descend, and its encounter with spring equinox reverses the upward flow of blood and energy, stirring restlessness and forgetfulness.]</p>
<p>In the case of the Yangming, when it is at its end, the mouth and eyes move involuntarily, resulting in startled and nonsensical speech. The color turns yellow, signaling a depletion of the upper and lower channels.<br>[Note: The Yangming meridians of the hands and feet are associated with the mouth and eyes, resulting in involuntary actions. Hearing sounds from wood leads to startlement, which is characteristic of Yangming. Speaking abusively without regard for kinship reflects nonsensical speech typical of Yangming. The yellow color is a manifestation of the earth energy of Yangming spilling out. The uprisen and downfallen channels signify the depletion of stomach energy without softness, and a lack of sensation in the skin indicates a deficiency in the protective energy.]</p>
<p>Discussion of meridians</p>
<p>Experiencing fright disturbs the breath, causing it to escape from the lungs, and the errant energy harms the heart.<br>[Note: Fright disrupts energy, leading to breath escaping from the lungs. The lungs cover the heart, thus errant energy injures the heart.]</p>
<p>Startlement depletes vitality, causing sweat to emerge from the heart.<br>[Note: Blood is the essence of the heart, and sweat is the fluid of the blood. Startlement injures the heart&#39;s energy, resulting in sweat from the heart, hence the description of the depletion of essence.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatise on Febrile Diseases</h3>
<p>For those suffering from water-related ailments, they cannot lie down; if they do, it leads to shock, and such shock greatly intensifies coughing.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The evil of the kidneys affects the stomach, hence one cannot lie down. The imbalance of yin and yang causes fear and anxiety. The heart’s energy rises in the lungs, where metal fears fire and heat, resulting in severe coughing.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Pain</h3>
<p>When shocked, the heart has no support, the spirit has no place to return, and thoughts cannot settle, leading to chaotic energy.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Shock causes the heart’s energy to disperse without a place to rely on, the mind wanders without a home, and thoughts are confused without resolution, hence the chaotic energy.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Bi Syndrome</h3>
<p>For those with liver bi syndrome, significant shock occurs at night when lying down.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The liver houses the soul; when lying down, the spirit is unsettled, thus leading to shock.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Syncope</h3>
<p>Lesser Yang syncope causing intestinal abscesses is untreatable; those in shock are doomed.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The lesser Yang&#39;s fire governs energy, and when it reverses within, it leads to intestinal abscesses. &quot;Untreatable&quot; means the disease is within the energy realm, while the abscess is internal, making needling ineffective. If shock occurs, the toxic energy affects the organs, leading to death. </p>
<p>Greater Yang syncope results in wheezing, coughing, body heat, heightened fear, and epistaxis with hematemesis.<br><strong>Note:</strong> When the energy of greater Yang is constrained, it causes wheezing; if it reverses, it leads to coughing. The energy of greater Yang governs musculature, hence the body heat. The classics say: &quot;When both Yang energies manifest illness, fear ensues.&quot; The presence of blood in the nose and vomiting blood is due to the hot energy of greater Yang being constrained and forcing blood to move erratically.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Three Yang and one Yin; when the Taiyin pulse prevails, one Yin cannot stop, causing internal chaos in the five organs and external fright. </p>
<p><strong>Pulsation Explanation</strong></p>
<p>In Yangming, it is said that excessive conditions lead to collapse; wicked people are akin to fire, and when they hear the sound of wood, they become startled and alarmed. This is because the Yang energy and Yin energy are at odds, with water and fire being antagonistic, hence the startle and alarm.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Constants</strong></p>
<p>The chronicle of harmony leads to fright.<br>(Here, an evil force damages the liver.)<br>The chronicle of hidden brightness leads to symptoms of confusion, sorrow, and forgetfulness, stemming from water&#39;s transformation.<br>(Confusion, sorrow, and forgetfulness arise from insufficient spirit energy.)<br>In the Taiyang realm, cold air descends, the heart&#39;s energy ascends, and hot energy moves aimlessly, leading to forgetfulness.<br>(Cold air descends while organ energy ascends, and hot energy moves aimlessly, hence the spirit is harmed, leading to forgetfulness.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>The liver is obstructed, both sides full, causing fright when lying down, preventing urination.<br>(This is due to illness in the liver channel, hence both sides are full and urination is obstructed. The obstruction of organ energy leads to a restless spirit, causing fright.)<br>The liver pulse is restless and violent, leading to fright and alarm.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The rapid and chaotic pulse of the liver must come from a shock. The two Yang energies are urgent and cause fear. When the pulse is fast, it can easily startle a person, and this can last for three to four days before self-recovery. The formless energy rising against the normal flow causes the pulse to become fast. When the pathogen is shallow and affects the heart, it leads to a shock. </p>
<p>Both the kidney and liver wanting to be startled indicate a depletion of blood and Qi, represented by the thin pulse. The energy of the liver is generated in the kidney, and the thin pulse signifies the depletion of energy from both organs, leading to a desire to be shocked.</p>
<p>In cases of excessive recovery of the Sun, it can reach the heart, causing forgetfulness and deep sadness. When the Shen gate is obstructed, it leads to death without treatment. The forgetfulness and sadness stem from the stomach affecting the heart. </p>
<p>In the case of the lesser Yang being victorious, heat invades the stomach, causing excessive fear and delirium, and if it worsens, this leads to shock with cough and epistaxis. When heat invades the heart and lungs, it leads to fear and other symptoms. </p>
<p>The excessive recovery of the greater Yang can affect the liver, leading to fear and muscle spasms. If the illness penetrates the liver, it greatly affects the organ. When the organ is distressed, it represents a state of being half-alive and half-dead. </p>
<p>All illnesses associated with fear relate to fire. This fire comes from the lesser Yang&#39;s relationship with the fiery dynamic. When the fire is excessive, the heart&#39;s spirit becomes unsettled, causing fear.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>The True Discussion on the Jade Mechanism</h3>
<p>When the spring pulses are excessive, it causes forgetfulness and sudden dizziness along with headaches.<br>[Note: The excessive spring pulse causes the Qi to rise. The Classic says: When Qi rises, it becomes chaotic and leads to forgetfulness. The Qi is abundant and meets the governing vessel at the top, resulting in dizziness and headaches.]</p>
<h3>The Discussion on Acupuncture According to the Four Seasons</h3>
<p>When needling the meridians in autumn, the blood and Qi rise inversely, causing forgetfulness.<br>[Note: Autumn signifies descending and gathering, which turns to promote growth, thus the blood and Qi rise inversely and lead to forgetfulness.]  </p>
<p>When needling the muscles in winter, the Yang Qi becomes exhausted, causing forgetfulness.<br>[Note: Winter signifies closure of the organs. Needling the muscles extracts the latent Qi from the flesh, leading to the exhaustion of the Yang Qi within and causing forgetfulness.]  </p>
<p>When the Yangming is sluggish, it leads to accumulated diseases and frequent fright.<br>[Note: Sluggishness indicates more blood and less Qi, with slight cold. Frequent fright suggests that the disease resides in the blood.]</p>
<h3>The Discussion on the Five Excesses</h3>
<p>For those yet to be diagnosed with a disease, one must differentiate between the consistently wealthy and the subsequently impoverished. Even if not afflicted by an evil spirit, illness arises from within, termed &quot;loss of essence.&quot; Consistent wealth followed by poverty is termed &quot;loss of vital essence.&quot; When the five Qi linger, diseases may coexist. The physician diagnoses them, but they do not involve the organs, nor do they change the shape of the body, leading to uncertainty in diagnosing and an inability to identify the disease by name. The body diminishes daily, with Qi being empty and lacking essence; the disease is deep and lacks Qi, resulting in occasional fright. For those with deep-seated maladies, it is due to external consumption of the protective Qi and internal depletion of the nourishing Qi. A skilled physician may not recognize the true nature of the illness; this is an error in treatment.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Wealth often comes after poverty, and honor comes after disgrace; this can harm one&#39;s aspirations and intentions, leading to internal ailments even if not due to external evils. The spleen houses essence, which embodies intention; the kidneys store essence, which embodies will. Therefore, when intentions are lost, and essence is detached, it causes distress. The five energies linger, referring to the spiritual energies of the five organs, which become stagnant within and do not circulate freely. &quot;Concurrence&quot; refers to diseases affecting the five organs. The energies of the five organs correspond externally to the skin, muscles, tendons, and bones; hence, the body gradually weakens. When there is a deficiency of energy and essence, and diseases are deep without vital energy, it indicates that energy arises from essence, and essence arises from energy—the conjunction of essence and energy leads to harm. For example, when someone experiences prolonged wealth and honor but unexpectedly loses it, they may feel shocked. This ailment does not reside in the organs or the body shape; it is a daily depletion of essence and energy. Even with a skilled physician, if the cause is not understood, it reflects a flaw in treatment. </p>
<p><strong>Generative Treatise of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse arrives white, it indicates wheezing and floating; the upper part is vacuous, and the lower part is solid, resulting in astonishment. <strong>Note:</strong> When breathing is rapid, the pulse is also rapid. The lungs govern qi, so the pulse is floating due to deficiency. There is illness in qi but not in blood; the disease is in the upper but not in the lower, hence the pulse is vacuous above and solid below. When yang energy is deficient, it easily leads to shock.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Regulation of Menstruation Treatise</strong></p>
<p>Blood accumulates in the yin, and qi accumulates in the yang, thus leading to shock and mania.<br><em>Annotation: When blood accumulates in the yin, the yin is strong and blood is substantial. The heart governs blood vessels, thus a strong yin leads to shock. When qi accumulates in the yang, the yang is strong and qi is substantial, resulting in mania.</em></p>
<p>Blood accumulates below, qi accumulates above, causing confusion and forgetfulness.<br><em>Annotation: When blood accumulates below, it gathers in the lower regions, leading to forgetfulness. When qi accumulates above, it rebels upwards, resulting in confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Strange Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: There is an illness that appears massive as if filled with water; palpating its pulse is large and tense, and the body feels no pain, being neither thin nor unable to eat, but eating little. What illness is this? Qibo said: The illness arises from the kidneys, known as kidney wind. Kidney wind leads to an inability to eat and is prone to shock. Once shocked, if the heart&#39;s qi is weak, death follows.<br><em>Annotation: The foot&#39;s lesser yin cold water governs qi; a large pulse indicates wind, and a tense pulse indicates cold. In the case of water wind illness, external symptoms show bone and joint pain, yet this illness resides in the kidneys. It is not caused by external wind evils, hence there is no bodily pain. Water qi ascends, making the body not thin. Wind and water evils encroach upon the earth&#39;s qi, hence the inability to eat, and even if eating, it is not much. Being prone to shock indicates that water qi invades the heart. If after shocking, the heart&#39;s qi is weak, the heart has suffered damage from the evil.</em><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Yangming Pulse Examination</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;The pulse of the foot Yangming indicates that one suffers from a dislike of people and fire; upon hearing the sound of wood, one is startled and frightened, whereas the sounds of bells and drums do not provoke movement. Why is this? I wish to know the reason!&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Yangming refers to the stomach pulse. The stomach symbolizes earth. Therefore, being startled upon hearing the sound of wood signifies that earth is averse to wood.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>When the spleen transfers heat to the liver, it results in sudden fright and nosebleeds.</p>
<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Six Fundamental Principles</strong></p>
<p>The governance of Shaoyang corresponds to the periods of Yin and Shen. Its ailments include dizziness and sudden fright in the sides. </p>
<p>Sudden fright comes from Shaoyin, while restlessness arises from Shaoyang. This is common to summer illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on Blood, Qi, Form, and Will</strong></p>
<p>The state of fear and terror disrupts the channels; illness arises from a lack of benevolence. It should be treated with massage and medicinal decoctions. Fear causes disruption of qi, and terror causes qi to descend. Since blood follows the movement of qi, when qi is disordered and moving in reverse, the channels are obstructed and the nourishing and protective energies do not function, leading to sickness arising from a lack of benevolence. Thus, it is advisable to use massage and medicinal decoctions to restore the flow of nourishing and protective blood and qi.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Classic Text of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the Origins of Diseases</strong></p>
<p>In the midst of the void and external evils, during times of abnormal occurrence, one may feel startled and joyful. [Note: This refers to diseases of the Yangming meridian, hence the startle and joy.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The heart governs the hand’s Jueyin meridian; when it is excessively active, it leads to fullness in the chest and ribs, and causes great agitation within the heart. [Note: When extreme, it suggests an excess within.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the True Spirit</strong></p>
<p>When the kidneys are in excess and unyielding, they injure the will; when the will is injured, joy is forgotten, making it impossible to bend and stretch the waist and spine. The hair becomes frail, and the complexion pales, leading to death in late summer. [Note: Forgetting joy indicates damage to the spirit. The waist corresponds to the kidneys, hence the inability to bend and stretch.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Great Confusion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes a person to be prone to forgetfulness? Qibo replied: There is insufficient energy above and excess energy below; the intestines and stomach are full while the heart and lungs are deficient. When deficient, the nutrients cannot rise in time, thus causing frequent forgetfulness. [Note: The excess below coupled with deficiency above leads to fullness in the digestive organs while the heart and lungs are lacking; the stagnation prevents timely ascent of nutrients, resulting in forgetfulness.]<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Jingji Syndrome Treatment</strong></p>
<p>There are four types of diseases arising from shock: running piglet syndrome, purulent vomiting, fright, and fiery evil. All these conditions result from shock. The master said: running piglet syndrome originates from the lower abdomen, surging upward to the throat, resulting in a near-death experience followed by cessation, all stemming from fear. The patient speaks in a quiet manner, startled by sudden sounds, indicating joint issues. </p>
<p>For men whose complexion is thin, this indicates thirst and blood loss, resulting in sudden palpitations. A floating pulse indicates internal deficiency; when there&#39;s weakness in the interior, it may lead to palpitations, nosebleeds, abdominal pain, loss of semen in dreams, aching limbs, heat in the hands and feet, and dryness of the throat. Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction treats this. Water resides in the kidneys, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.</p>
<p>If a patient drinks excessively, they will definitely experience sudden palpitations. Generally, eating little while drinking a lot can cause water to accumulate beneath the heart; in severe cases, this leads to palpitations, while in milder cases, it results in shortness of breath. A double-string pulse indicates coldness, which signifies a significant deficiency after purging. A biased string pulse suggests fluid retention.</p>
<p>For sudden vomiting, a feeling of fullness beneath the heart, and water accumulation in the diaphragm, along with dizziness and palpitations, Banxia Jia Fuling Decoction should be prescribed. A pulse that is weak and moves indicates shock; weak pulses signify palpitations. For palpitations beneath the heart, Banxia Mahuang Wan should be administered.</p>
<p>After sweating, if there are palpitations below the navel suggesting running piglet syndrome, Fuling Guizhi Gancao Dazao Decoction is the appropriate remedy.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong> (by Wang Shuhe, Jin Dynasty)</p>

<p>When the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s cun position is full in both Yin and Yang, it indicates fullness in both the Taiyin and Yangming channels. The patient suffers from headaches, dizziness, shock, mania, throat pain, tension in the arms, and inability to close the lips; it is named fullness of both lungs and large intestine.<br>When the left wrist&#39;s guan position pulse is empty in both Yin and Yang, it indicates emptiness in both the Jueyin and Shaoyang channels.

The patient suffers from abdominal fullness, hardness, pain in the flanks, stagnant stomach qi, constipation, and occasionally diarrhea, with abdominal pain, which rises to the lungs and liver, stirring the five organs, leading to wheezing, frequent shock, body heat, and inability to sweat, with throat obstruction and scanty essence; it is named fullness of both spleen and stomach.<br>When the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s cun position shows Yang deficiency, it indicates the Yangming channel. The patient suffers from wheezing in the chest, bowel sounds, emptiness thirst, dry lips, urgent eyes, prone to shock and diarrhea; it is named deficiency and cold of the large intestine.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>In the diagnostic area of the left hand at the wrist, if the pulse is weak and yin is deficient, it corresponds to the hand&#39;s Lesser Yin Meridian. The patient suffers from palpitations, anxiety, and malaise, experiencing abdominal pain that is hard to express. The heart feels cold and scattered, which is termed heart deficiency-cold.</p>
<p>If a patient suddenly drinks a lot of water, they will certainly suffer from violent coughing and fullness. Generally, if food intake is low and water intake is high, it leads to water accumulation under the heart, and in severe cases, this causes palpitations.</p>
<p>When the diagnosis reveals a sinking and hollow heart pulse, the condition will have variable presentations, including fullness in the chest with palpitations, abdominal heat, a flushed face, dry throat, irritability, heat in the palms, and in severe cases, spitting blood, convulsions, and blood stasis. In summer, there are heat symptoms, while in winter, there are severe symptoms, presenting with a red complexion.</p>
<p>The sound of the pulse indicates the state of the heart. If the heart&#39;s sound is cheerful, it has a pleasant tone; the intention is happiness, correlating to the Lesser Yin Meridian. If there is counterflow in the Sun Meridian, the protective and nourishing energies are obstructed, resulting in a reversal of yin and yang. The yang energy attacks outward, while the yin energy is injured internally, leading to coldness. Coldness leads to deficiency, which causes fright and palpitations; for this, the Calming Heart Decoction is the remedy.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Forgetfulness</strong></p>
<p>The pulse at the &quot;Fuyang&quot; point is floating and slow; the Shaoyang pulse is slightly tight, indicating blood deficiency. The tightness suggests slight cold, which is associated with &quot;mouse milk.&quot; When diagnosing pulmonary accumulation, the pulse feels floating and pressing it causes discomfort. There is pain in the sides that sometimes reverses; the back feels strained and painful. Symptoms include shortness of breath, forgetfulness, closed eyelids with the formation of sores, cold skin, with conditions worsening in summer and improving in autumn. Pain occurs in the skin intermittently, resembling the sensation of lice, and in severe cases, it feels like needle pricks along with intermittent itching and a pale color.</p>
<p>In people of gentle nature, they may groan and easily become angry; when angry, they tend to forget and seem lost in thought. This indicates the earth damaging water. Yang attacks yin, causing the yin energy to descend and the yang energy to rise; when it rises, it generates heat, leading to fullness, anger, and forgetfulness. They may hear without understanding; their limbs feel rushed, and their urine is reddish-yellow. Although they may speak, their words do not come out, instead they laugh while watching others—this is due to evil heat damaging the kidneys, and in severe cases, it may be untreatable. If the face appears black and yellow with unresponsive ears, treatment is still possible. </p>
<p>The pulse at the &quot;Shenmen&quot; point on the left hand suggests fullness of yin; this corresponds to the foot&#39;s Shaoyin meridian. The patient suffers from dry tongue, swollen throat, restlessness, dry throat, intermittent pain in the chest and sides, wheezing, coughing, and sweating; the lower abdomen feels distended; the lower back is tight and painful; they feel heavy in body and bones warm; their urine is reddish-yellow, easily angered and forgetful; their feet feel hot and painful; their limbs appear dark and they suffer from deafness, which is termed kidney heat due to fullness.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The state of fright and palpitations arises from a deficiency of the heart and a lack of courage. The heart is the sovereign organ, from which the spirit emerges; courage governs decisiveness. When the heart is tranquil and the spirit is not fearful, one can think clearly and make good decisions. Sometimes, due to a significant shock, an illusory sound, or an unusual sight, one may experience fear while facing danger, which can agitate the heart and spirit, causing stagnation of energy and saliva, resulting in fright and palpitations. If fright persists, various symptoms may arise, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, sweating, swelling in the limbs, loss of appetite, agitation of the heart, and restless sitting or lying down—all signs of a deficient heart and lack of courage. The method of treatment is to calm the heart and strengthen the spirit; then, there will be no ailments left untreated. The state of disorientation indicates a deficiency of heart blood. The heart governs blood, and blood is the master of the heart; when blood is abundant, the heart can rest assured.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Many are eager to attain wealth and nobility, yet fear poverty and low status. When thoughts dwell on loved ones, unexpected events arise, causing true blood to be depleted, leading to disturbances in the heart. The mind of the sovereign loses its support, gradually causing confusion and anxiety. This persistent confusion gives rise to various ailments: a strong tongue yet foggy in perception, prone to worry and sadness, lacking vitality—these are signs of mental illness. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;Nourishing the heart benefits its glory.&quot; Thus, one should primarily replenish true blood. When true blood is abundant, the heart has support, and there is no ailment that cannot be cured. There are also instances of catching wind, cold, heat, and humidity, which block various meridians and lead to confusion; excessive intake of liquids can stagnate the stomach, also causing confusion. One must treat according to the symptoms presented.</p>
<p>As for forgetfulness, it often involves a tendency for joyful oblivion. The spleen governs intention and thoughts, while the heart also rules thinking. When thought is excessive, intentions become unclear, and the spirit&#39;s palace is not functionally active, leading to forgetfulness. The method for harmonizing this is to regulate both heart and spleen, ensuring tranquility of the spirit, thereby restoring awareness.</p>
<p>Causes of Shock Illness</p>
<p>Shock arises when the heart suddenly stirs and becomes unsettled. Fire is associated with movement, thus the heart fire becomes intensely hot. Nevertheless, this is merely extreme heat within; when fire reaches its peak, it resembles water, causing surprise. Conversely, when kidney water is undermined by fear, excess leads to harm; this is a matter of balance. The saying &quot;fear leads to surprise&quot; indicates that fear damages the kidneys and depletes water, thereby intensifying heart fire and resulting in surprise. A combination of yin and yang leading to fright results in back pain and sighing, referred to as Wind Disturbance. The stomach and spleen correspond to earth, while the liver corresponds to wood—wood overcomes earth. When wind dominates and dampness does not regulate kidney water, it causes an upward reversal.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Clear Theory</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heart Palpitations</strong>  </p>
<p>In cases of heart palpitations due to cold damage, how should one clarify this? Palpitations occur when the heart is weak. When one feels anxious and cannot find peace, this defines palpitations. The causes of heart palpitations fall into two categories: one is qi deficiency, and the other is stagnant fluid. In cases of cold damage lasting two or three days, if the person experiences palpitations accompanied by restlessness, the prescription is Xiao Jian Zhong Tang. If someone with a Shaoyin condition has severe palpitations, add five grams of cinnamon to Si Ni San. This indicates palpitations due to qi deficiency. If one drinks too much water, it will inevitably lead to palpitations below the heart, indicating palpitations due to stagnant fluid. The qi deficiency occurs because of weak yang energy within, leaving the heart below empty, causing internal movement of the righteous qi, which leads to palpitations. Stagnant fluid results from water accumulating below the heart; since the heart is fire and dislikes water, when water is stationary within, the heart&#39;s inability to find peace causes palpitations. Furthermore, after sweating or purging, if the righteous qi is internally weak and the evil qi strikes against it, this can also cause palpitations. In cases of yangming disease, if excessive sweating occurs, the individual may experience palpitations with a pressed heart and the hands crossed over the chest. If yangming illness leads to purging, and the body feels heavy with palpitations below the heart, one should not induce sweating.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The Shao Yang disease should not be treated with vomiting or purging; doing so will lead to palpitations and fright. The Shao Yang disease should not be treated with sweating; sweating will cause delirium. This pertains to the stomach: when the stomach is harmonious, recovery occurs; when the stomach is not harmonious, there will be agitation and palpitations. These symptoms arise from the lingering邪 (evil) after sweating, and those with qi deficiency and palpitations are distinct. Some conditions require stabilization, others require dispersion, all must be assessed to see if the qi is floating.</p>
<p>Additionally, excessive drinking causes water to accumulate, which can lead to palpitations. The &quot;Essentials from the Golden Cabinet&quot; states that when one eats little but drinks excessively, water can accumulate in the heart and lead to severe palpitations. Drinking causes palpitations more than other evils; even if other evils are present, one must first treat the palpitations. Why? Because when water accumulates in the heart, if the water vapor disperses, it can affect various organs: in the lungs, it leads to wheezing and coughing; in the stomach, it causes belching and choking; on the skin, it causes swelling; in the intestines, it leads to diarrhea. This cannot be treated lightly.</p>
<p>The classics say: when there are palpitations under the heart with a cold sensation, one should first treat the water condition, using Poria and Licorice Decoction, and then treat the cold sensation. Otherwise, the water will infiltrate the stomach and cause diarrhea. When the cold sensation is of deep origin, one should still treat the water condition first; how much more so for those with a shallow evil qi!<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> (Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng)  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>For fright and palpitations caused by blood deficiency, use Zhu Sha An Shen Wan. For phlegm obstructing the heart and diaphragm, any phlegm remedy will do, combined with Ding Zhi Wan, adding amber and turmeric. For sudden palpitations, this is also due to blood deficiency. Sudden palpitations that come and go indicate a lack of blood. Those with worries and disturbances belong to the deficient category. If it occurs intermittently, it is due to phlegm influenced by fire. Lean individuals often suffer from blood deficiency, while overweight individuals are related to phlegm. Generally, phlegm is more common. True awareness of heart palpitations indicates blood deficiency; remedies such as Si Wu and Zhu Sha An Shen can be used. If the illness arises from fright, this leads to a dispersion of the spirit; if the spirit departs, phlegm will arise. What governs a person is the heart, and what nourishes the heart is blood. When heart blood is deficient, the spirit cannot be contained, thus marking the onset of fright and palpitations. Is there no distinction between fright and palpitations? &quot;Fright&quot; refers to fear, while &quot;palpitations&quot; refer to sudden disturbances.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>When the heart is vacuous and there is phlegm, one may hear loud noises and see strange objects, and in times of danger may lose resolve, causing the heart to be agitated, resulting in a state of fright. When the heart is vacuous and water stagnates, there will be seepage within the chest, and the vacuous qi flows. When the water rises to the top, the heart&#39;s fire despises it, leading to unrest in the heart, which causes a feeling of depression; this is called palpitations. For fright, one uses a formula to expel phlegm and settle fright; for palpitations, a formula to expel water and dissolve fluids should be used. What is called supporting the vacuity merely involves nourishing the heart&#39;s blood and harmonizing the heart&#39;s qi. Forgetfulness often arises from a deficiency of spirit, and in some cases, also from phlegm. These conditions result from excessive worry and anxiety, damaging the heart&#39;s nurturing, leading to unclear consciousness and frequent forgetfulness, indicating that the issue lies within the heart and spleen. It is said that overthinking harms the spleen, causing forgetfulness; thus, one can treat it with the Gui Pi Decoction, while also addressing both the heart and spleen, ensuring the spirit is tranquil and the intention settled, after which the symptoms will naturally resolve.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Medical Transmission: On Palpitations and Anxiety</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The heart is the sovereign organ, from which the spirit emerges. The conditions of anxiety and palpitations may arise either from anger harming the liver or from fright affecting the gallbladder, which can lead to insufficiency in the heart&#39;s blood. Additionally, if one encounters numerous matters and endless thoughts, the sovereign heart also becomes unsettled, causing the spirit to be disturbed, resulting in symptoms of anxiety and palpitations. The term &quot;anxiety&quot; refers to a restlessness in the heart that cannot find tranquility, and it occurs at all times. &quot;Palpitations&quot; refer to sudden jumps and racing, resulting in a feeling of impending loss of consciousness, which can appear at times. Furthermore, the causes of these two conditions may also stem from the accumulation of phlegm and fluid, which can be retained in the heart and stomach, thus leading to these symptoms. One should not rigidly assume it is solely due to a deficiency of the heart; rather, treatment should be based on the pulse and symptoms to determine its essence and address it accordingly, avoiding errors in diagnosis.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from palpitations due to shock from events that disturb the heart and spirit, resulting in blocked qi and phlegm, this is caused by emptiness in the heart and timidity; thus, one should use Wending Decoction. If there is vomiting, replace the bamboo shavings with ginseng. If one has many strange dreams while sleeping and wakes up startled, Wending Decoction should be added with 3 grams each of sour jujube seeds and lotus flesh, boiled with Fourteen Friends Pill, or Heart-calming Pills, or Yuanshi Powder mixed with wine. </p>
<p>For long-lasting thoughts about cherished matters leading to persistent anxiety, resulting in a depletion of essence and insufficient heart blood, this condition is known in common terms as palpitations and erratic pulse; thus, one should use Yirong Decoction. Palpitations, known as &quot;zhong,&quot; can be confused with &quot;jingqi.&quot; Although they are similar, they are fundamentally different. Palpitations occur from shocking events, while &quot;zhong&quot; arises from no specific shock, causing a constant state of anxiety. How can one not distinguish between them? </p>
<p>Influences from wind, cold, heat, and humidity that block the meridians can also lead to anxiety; each should be addressed according to their respective categories.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>For those who experience fright due to phlegm and fluids, administer Phlegm-Transforming Decoction with fried sour jujube seeds, and follow with Shouxing Pills. </p>

<p>In cases of chest oppression with lack of appetite, if one often feels timid in the heart, prefers dark rooms, or leans against doors, startled and avoiding others, this is known as lowly timidity due to blood deficiency.

<p>For those who forget easily, losing track of events and thoughts, this is due to excessive contemplation and is a condition of the heart and spleen. It is appropriate to use Gui Pi Decoction.</p>
<p>For those who forget, beginning many things but finishing none, speaking without continuity; this is due to illness, and is not merely a natural foolishness of not understanding human affairs.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Li Zhen]</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Overthinking and severe shock can lead to a deficiency of the heart, resulting in phlegm stagnation, or hearing loud sounds and seeing unusual objects may provoke fear and palpitation. In extreme cases, this can lead to a sensation of impending collapse and a weak, thready pulse, indicating deficiency. For blood deficiency, use Si Wu Decoction, Fu Shen Decoction, Miao Xiang Powder, or Zhu Sha An Shen Pills. If both qi and blood are deficient, use Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction or Yang Xin Decoction. If symptoms appear intermittently, it is phlegm; use Er Chen Decoction with Bai Zhu, Huang Lian, Yuan Zhi, Zhu Li, and ginger juice. </p>
<p>Long-lasting palpitations due to shock are caused by phlegm below and fire above. Use Wen Dan Decoction with Huang Lian, Shan Zhi, Dang Gui, and Bei Mu. For qi stagnation, use Si Qi Decoction with Fu Shen, Yuan Zhi, Zhu Li, and ginger juice, or Ten Flavor Wen Dan Decoction or Jin Bo Zhen Xin Pills. If there are symptoms of phlegm accumulation causing a rumbling sound in the chest and a feeling of unease, use Er Chen Decoction with Fu Shen, Bing Lang, Mai Men Dong, and Chen Xiang, or Zhu Que Pills. </p>
<p>For the two types of palpitations, commonly used are Gui Pi Decoction, Ren Shu Powder, Meng Shou Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, Shou Xing Pills, or Shen Zao Pills.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Palpitations are movements caused by external evil energies disturbing the heart, akin to someone trying to catch something, leading to a state of confusion and anxiety. When there is water stagnating beneath the heart, dizziness and trembling occur, and if one faints and experiences palpitations, it is because the water has permeated, and the palpitations and fainting can be stabilized. Those with a weak spirit and essentially empty heart, who cannot maintain their composure, may sweat, leading to internal emptiness and palpitations which are even more severe than the just empty-hearted individuals. One must first stabilize the energy before treating the palpitations. Generally, those who feel anxious first and then have palpitations are considered deficient, and should use Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction or Zhen Wu Decoction. For those with a weak pulse, Shi Gan Cao Decoction with a little wine is appropriate. Those who feel dizzy after sweating should take Gui Zhi Gan Cao Decoction. If palpitations come before anxiety, it indicates heat, and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is recommended. For those with a propensity to vomit, rambling speech, and difficult bowel movements, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with a bit more Da Huang or a little Mang Xiao is indicated. For those with rambling speech and difficulty in urination, Chai Hu Long Gu Mu Li Decoction is suitable. Those with red urine should take Wu Ling San. </p>
<p>If confusion persists for a long time, it leads to forgetfulness, indicating a deficiency of heart and spleen blood, and insufficient clear energy. The condition results from turbid energy rising and mistaking the spirit for the true essence. There may also be inherent deficiencies; for those prone to forgetfulness, one should greatly replenish their qi and blood and use Ding Zhi Wan. For older individuals with declining spirit, Jia Jian Gu Ben Wan should be included, additionally using Gui Pi Decoction, Ren Shu San, Meng Shou Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, Shou Xing Wan, or Shen Jiao Wan.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Medicine by Li Zhongzi</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>It is noted that external dangers can cause shock; those with strong hearts and courage cannot be harmed, while those with weak hearts easily become startled. This shock may lead to phlegm due to stagnation, and when phlegm and qi clash, various symptoms may arise, such as shortness of breath or spontaneous sweating, which can be treated with the Warm Gallbladder Decoction. If there is vomiting, ginseng can be used instead of bamboo shavings. If one has numerous strange dreams causing sudden waking, add jujube seeds and lotus seeds to the Warm Gallbladder Decoction, decocted with gold and silver. Other remedies include the Tranquil Heart Pill, the Forgetting Will Pill, the Wonderful Fragrance Powder, the Amber Heart-Nourishing Pill, and the Decisive Will Pill. For frequent night terrors and vocalizations during sleep, use Mother of Pearl Pill or the Angelica Decoction. If startled unexpectedly, heavy tranquilizers should be administered; a fine powder of the mystic temple monk&#39;s herb can be mixed with tea, or the Huanglian Tranquil Heart Pill can be utilized. For heat-induced phlegm, use the Cold Water Stone Powder, or if phlegm arises from qi stagnation, add flavors to the Four-Seven Decoction.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Danxi said: When startled, the spirit leaves the dwelling, leaving it empty and allowing fluid to accumulate; phlegm and saliva are forever linked within the channels. Control the saliva using Dan with cinnabar and distant will. The classic states: When the heart is obstructed, the pulse does not flow. When agitated, the area below the heart feels like a drum, as it is closed and does not circulate. The illness is due to heat stagnating and producing saliva; when the saliva forms, there is restlessness and the area below the heart pulsates. The pulsation is akin to the beating of a drum. For the five obstruction decoction, add Fushen, distant will, and Banxia. According to the classics and the &quot;Original Patterns of Illness&quot;: when water is deficient and fire is excessive, the chest is agitated, and the Tianwang Heart-Supplementing Pill is indicated. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: When the heart is fiery and dislikes water, and water is stagnant below the heart, creating a throbbing sensation, one cannot settle; deal with it using Banxia Mahuang Pill or Fuling Drink. If there has been sweating, vomiting, or purging resulting in deficiency of righteous Qi leading to palpitations and inability to lie down, Warm Gallbladder Decoction is appropriate. Danxi attributes it to deficiency and phlegm, suggesting the use of Cinnabar and Distant Will Pill.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Those who drink are troubled by phlegm and saliva. However, the symptoms are not uniform; they mainly stem from heart distress causing fire to rise, or stagnant fire generating phlegm. The distinctions between deficiency and excess, the differences in qi and blood, phlegm and fluid, cold and heat, as well as external injuries or internal emotional disturbances, should be thoroughly examined by the clinician. </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage, when there is a pounding sensation in the heart leading to anxiety and unrest, the pulse is wiry and intermittent; prescribe Zhizhucan decoction. If after three or four days of cold damage there is heart palpitations and agitation, use Xiao Jian Zhong Tang. If sweating is excessive and there is a tendency to prefer pressure on the heart, apply Guizhi Gan Cao Tang. For unsettled mind, restlessness, and inability to sleep, use An Shen Wan. In lesser yin disorder with reversal and palpitations below the heart, add Gui to Si Ni San. If there is excessive drinking and palpitations, despite other pathogenic influences, first treat the fluid retention with Fuling Gan Cao Tang. For palpitations with cold and heat, difficulty in urination, and irritability with a tendency to vomit, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Lesser Yang causes sweating, accompanied by delirium and palpitations, treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. The pulse at the inch position is agitated; generally, during fright, the pulse stops and then returns. The person&#39;s eyes do not move, and they are unable to breathe out. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the origin of forgetfulness is attributable to the failure of the heart and kidneys to communicate. The heart does not descend to connect with the kidneys, causing turbidity and chaos in the spirit. The kidneys do not ascend to connect with the heart, leading to a lack of vital energy. When fire remains above, it causes phlegm; when water is below, it results in restlessness. Thus, there is confusion, and one cannot attain tranquility. Therefore, tonifying the kidneys and allowing them to rise, nourishing the heart and enabling its proper descent can lead to clarity of spirit and stable intent, eliminating forgetfulness. Overthinking is addressed with Gui Pi Decoction. Mental fatigue is treated with Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction and Ning Zhi Ointment. Phlegm obstructing the heart orifices is remedied by guiding phlegm decoction paired with Shou Xing Pills. For the failure of heart and kidney communication, Zhu Que Pill is used.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about the distinctions between agitation, palpitations, and fear, and it was said: Palpitations are the same as agitation. Agitation, in essence, arises from a lack of calmness within the heart. Surprise, on the other hand, is caused by an external stimulus. Zhang Zihe said: Surprise results from ignorance of oneself; fear arises from self-awareness. Indeed, surprise occurs when one hears a sound causing alarm, while fear comes from self-awareness, as in the case when one feels they might be caught and cannot sit or lie down alone without needing a companion to feel secure. Some might even need a light at night; if no candle or lamp is available, they feel fear. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; does not mention surprise and fear, as it begins from the &quot;Golden Coffer Prescriptions,&quot; which states: &quot;There is surprise followed by fear&quot;; it adds that surprise and fear become apparent. Surprise and fear refer to the same concept of alarm and dread, and fear also implies apprehension, thus sharing a similar meaning. Generally, when both names are mentioned together as a framework, it pertains to the interplay of yin and yang. For instance, when joy and anger are mentioned together, joy emanates from the heart (yang), while anger arises from the liver (yin). When will and intention are discussed together, will is static and unchanging (yin), while intention is dynamic and unstable (yang). Static indicates yin, while dynamic indicates yang.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Fear and shock arise when external events disturb the inner mind. When the heart is moved, the spirit becomes unsettled; when there is confusion from outside, it frustrates one&#39;s aspirations, leading to a retreat of one&#39;s essence. Thus, in the Inner Canon it is said: when shocked, the heart has nowhere to rely on, the spirit has nowhere to return, and thoughts cannot settle, causing the qi to be disrupted. In fear, the essence retreats, leading to the closure of the upper burner; when closed, there is no qi returning; without qi returning, the lower burner becomes swollen, causing the qi to stagnate. It is also said: experiencing wealth after poverty or distress after happiness, sorrow and worry being internally bound, may lead to the loss of essence and a deep-rooted illness with insufficient qi, resulting in a sudden shock. Such cases are all illnesses that arise from external events disturbing the inner heart and spirit. </p>
<p>As for the internal balance of yin and yang affecting shock and fear, shock is caused by fire and heat agitating the heart; when the heart is disturbed, the spirit becomes chaotic, and the spirit’s use lacks direction. Thus, the manifestations of shock vary and depend on the individual, corresponding with the five spirits. The liver houses the hun (ethereal soul); when the hun is unsettled, it causes alarm and delusion. The lung houses the po (corporal soul); when the po is restless, it leads to agitation. The spleen houses the yi (intellect); when the yi is not focused, it causes confusion. The kidney houses will; when the will is frustrated, it leads to fear and trepidation. Although the stomach has no spirit, it is considered the sea of the five organs; when numerous heat energies return to it, it results in shock and mania. For instance, upon hearing the sound of wood, the heart may tremble and yearn to move. Fear, then, arises as heat injures the kidneys; when the kidneys are harmed, the essence becomes deficient; when the essence is deficient, there is insufficient will. Since the will is originally steady and unchanging, fear does not exhibit other forms.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; regarding the disease caused by shock, there are two types of heat and fire. The qi of the celestial controller is related to the reaction of the springs, which leads to various heat-related illnesses in different channels, as well as the accumulation of the three yang and the qi combining with the yang, all of which contribute to shock and similar ailments. Therefore, in a general sense, it is said that all diseases of shock derive from fire.</p>
<p>For the fear-induced illness, it arises from the essence and qi combining in the kidneys, leading to fear. A deficiency in blood can also cause fear. If there is a deficiency in yin, the yang will intrude upon it, causing them to clash, resulting in fear. Furthermore, if the stomach qi is hot and the kidney qi is weak, fear can occur, regardless of whether the kidneys are compromised.</p>
<p>However, when the liver is involved, the shock and fear may interact, as the liver’s qi belongs to the yang while residing in the yin, storing blood and the soul. If the soul is unsettled, the spirit becomes agitated; when the spirit is agitated, shock occurs. A deficiency in blood leads to discontent, and discontent leads to fear. Hence, both conditions are attributed to the liver.</p>
<p>Similar situations arise from the two types of heat, attributed to external pathogenic influences. Other forms of shock and fear arise from the internal fluctuations of a person&#39;s qi in relation to yin and yang. However, it is not solely about the two forms of heat. When there is a rapid pulse in the yangming channel, this too can induce shock.</p>
<p>It is queried whether the diseases of shock and fear, arising from internal and external causes, have the same or different treatment methods. It is stated that for shock, one should pacify the spirit; for fear, one should stabilize the will. Treatment should distinguish between yin and yang, hence they cannot be treated alike.</p>
<p>The changes in the I Ching depict the interaction of the heavens and the earth, with the hexagrams of Kan and Li arranged, leading to their interplay resulting in a completed state, corresponding to the five organs of the human body.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The heart represents the fire of separation, with inward yin and outward yang; the kidney represents the water of the abyss, with inward yang and outward yin. The internal is the master, and the external is the application. The internal masters are the five spirits, while the external applications are the five energies. Therefore, the heart governs with the spirit as the master and uses yang; the kidney governs with will as the master and uses yin. Yang corresponds to qi and fire; yin corresponds to essence and water. When water and fire are harmonized, it all relies on nourishing the spirit with yin essence, while storing yang qi below to stabilize the will. Otherwise, the spirit will be restless internally, yang qi will disperse externally, the will will be disturbed internally, and yin essence will flee below, and with the distinction between the two organ&#39;s water and fire, how can the treatment not differ in some way? Thus, for those who are startled, one must first calm their spirit; only then can the scattered qi be gathered. When qi is gathered, the yang pathway can function. For those who are fearful, one must first stabilize their will; only then can the fleeing essence be secured. When essence is secured, the yin qi can function. Regarding medicine, the two organs have distinct roles as sovereign, minister, and assistants in their usage, and the effects felt from the internal and external are not so different. For those startled by external matters, although Ziheshi mentions that the startled should be made calm, which is common practice, allowing the patient to hear and become accustomed to it so that they are naturally unstartled is indeed a good method. However, it is better to bring peace to the heart and ease the qi beforehand, and then use medicine. I say that, for internal qi affecting the spirit, one should not employ Zhang’s method but should instead use medicine to balance the rise and fall of yin and yang, after which the spirit can be calmed and the will can be stabilized.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>In the &quot;Theory of Febrile Diseases,&quot; the character for &quot;palpitation&quot; is explained as follows: The term &quot;palpitation&quot; refers to the heart being anxious, causing a feeling of restlessness and agitation, leading to an inability to find peace. Therefore, palpitation is synonymous with fright and agitation. However, modern interpretations divide this into two categories, which is incorrect. The causes of heart palpitations fall into two types: one is deficiency, and the other is excess intake. </p>
<p>In cases of qi deficiency, it arises from the internal weakness of yang qi, resulting in an empty heart space where the internal heat causes palpitations. The same applies to blood deficiency. Cases of fluid retention occur when water stagnates below the heart, where the heart, being related to fire, repels water. When water is stagnant, the heart cannot find peace, resulting in palpitations. </p>
<p>After sweating, vomiting, or purging, if the vital energy is internally deficient, palpitations may occur; if there is an invasion of pathogenic energy, palpitations may also arise; and if there is a depletion of the nourishing and defending energies leading to pulse irregularities, the condition worsens. It is essential to generate bodily fluids and nourish blood to alleviate deficiency, especially when discussing febrile diseases. </p>
<p>Regarding mixed diseases, one may refer to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which states that in heart obstruction, there is a lack of pulse circulation, leading to discomfort in the chest. In cases of gallbladder disease, symptoms include bitter taste in the mouth, vomiting of residual bile, and a feeling of fear and anxiety as if one is about to be captured. The yangming channel is associated with movement; upon hearing wood sounds, one may feel startled; the pericardium is also linked to movement, with symptoms manifesting as great agitation in the heart; the kidneys relate to movement as well, presenting with heightened feelings of fear, resembling the sensation of impending capture.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The &quot;Yuan Bing Shi&quot; states: When water diminishes and fire rises, the heart and chest become agitated, which is termed &quot;zhengchong&quot; (anxiety). Then it is understood that palpitations are a sickness, stemming from the heart&#39;s energy being out of balance, with movements creating fire pathogens. The heart is the lord fire, and the pericardium is the minister fire. Fire is yang, and yang is active. Below the lord fire, the yin essence supports it; below the minister fire, the water qi supports it. When these energies move correctly, they maintain purity and brightness, vital for life. If there is a lack of support, the lord fire becomes excessive and unbalanced, turning into restlessness and heat, while the minister fire moves erratically, bringing about both heat and motion. Is it not evident that this leads to symptoms of palpitations? Moreover, the heart is where the spirit resides. The classics say that the interaction of the two essences is termed spirit, and also state that blood and qi are the spirit of a person, indicating that yin and yang, qi and blood, are never separate from the heart. If one loses the yin, tilting towards yang, the yang becomes disorganized and scattered due to the loss of its support, thus the spirit becomes unsettled and anxious. In such cases, one should replenish the deficient heart blood from within the heart to soothe the spirit; if this fails, one should seek to weaken the excess while reinforcing the water element to restrain the yang energy. Furthermore, the fire of the pericardium not only aids the heart but also circulates in the five organs; hence, any erratic movement of qi in the organs is also due to fire. Therefore, when each organ is ill, they can all act in concert with the fire of the pericardium, causing palpitations.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>In such cases, one should identify the source of the heat arising from each organ, and thereafter adjust and balance the protective layer according to what is beneficial for treatment. If the heat from various organs moves to the heart and causes the fire of the protective layer to ignite, the treatment should also follow this principle. If the heart&#39;s qi is insufficient, and the kidney&#39;s water surges upward to stagnate in the heart, it is necessary to overcome the counteracting qi, drain excess water, and nourish the yang. If the true water of the left kidney is insufficient, and the fire of the right kidney rises and interacts with the protective layer, one must vigorously replenish the yin of the left kidney to counteract it. If internal and external evils stifle the two fires, preventing them from surging forth and blocking the nourishment of the correct qi, treatment should primarily focus on dispelling the evils and resolving the stagnation. If phlegm and fluid stagnate in the middle-jiao, obstructing the meridians and preventing smooth flow, and if the stifled fire collides with phlegm beneath the heart, causing palpitations, one must clear the phlegm, and once the meridians are flowing, the illness will resolve. </p>
<p>Human temperament is inherently different; when one obtains clear qi, the heart’s perception is bright, while when one acquires turbid qi, the heart’s perception becomes dull. The clarity of the heart has no limits; even matters from a thousand or a hundred generations past, once seen, will be remembered for a lifetime and not forgotten—how could one forget what is currently at hand? Conversely, the dullness of the heart results in limited spirit; thus, in the face of current matters, one cannot recall past events.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Liu Hejian stated that water is clear and bright while fire is dark and turbid, hence the highest virtue resembles water, while the lowest folly resembles fire; this is due to inherent qualities. If one&#39;s disposition is muddled, they cannot endure the disturbances of the world, and when disturbed, they lose their spirit and become forgetful. Indeed, qi and blood are the essence of a person. The classics say: &quot;In tranquility, the spirit is hidden; in agitation, it dissipates.&quot; Tranquility is the nature of water, while agitation is the function of fire. Therefore, when one&#39;s nature is tranquil, the heart remains centered; when emotions stir, the heart forgets the inside and becomes distracted by the outside. If agitation does not cease, forgetfulness also continues; if forgetfulness persists, the essence within becomes rare. If the essence within becomes rare, one often forgets the spoken words, even before a day has passed. Thus, many in the world forget because they are preoccupied, disturbed, and entangled in the affairs of life; their qi and blood become depleted, particularly if one&#39;s inherent qualities are above the average, and they maintain clarity that is not disturbed by external affairs, such a person is exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>From this, it can be inferred that while medicine certainly has the function of calming the heart and nourishing the blood, it is less effective than achieving peace of mind, easing one&#39;s qi, and nurturing one&#39;s inner self. On the other hand, forgetfulness linked to phlegm is a temporary ailment; however, the causes of forgetfulness are not solely phlegm. Anything that the heart is attached to, combined with the heat of various fires that disrupts the heart, can lead to forgetfulness. As stated in the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; great anger harms the will, and the will suffers from forgetfulness. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: &quot;Blood gathers below while qi gathers above; when in chaos, forgetfulness ensues.&quot; In this case, how can one not address each cause separately for treatment?<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>On Proof</strong></p>
<p>The ailment of frightful palpitations is characterized by a trembling heart and chest, a continual state of alarm and fear, leaving one unable to find peace at any time. However, in ancient times, there was no such name for this condition. In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it describes a major channel of the stomach called &quot;Xu Li,&quot; located beneath the left breast, whose movement corresponds to clothing and represents a leakage of vital energy. In the texts of the Yue people and Zhongjing, there is a differentiation of moving energies in the upper and lower regions, stating that all such energies should not be sweated out. All these conditions are indeed types of frightful palpitations. This symptom is only found in those who suffer from Yin deficiency and overexertion. When Yin is deficient below, the vital energy has no root, and so it does not return to its source; thus, it floats and shakes in the chest above and vibrates beside the navel below. Those with mild deficiency will experience minor movements, while those with severe deficiency will experience intense movements. Those afflicted should promptly regulate desires and labor, and strictly abstain from alcohol and sensual pleasures. In treatment, one should promptly nurture energy and essence and reinforce the foundation. If one mistakenly believes this to be phlegm-fire and mistakenly implements purging treatments, it will hasten their danger. </p>
<p>There are two types of fright: one that arises from illness and one that arises from fright leading to illness. For example, when the eastern color is green, it communicates with the liver, causing alarming symptoms; also, in cases of cold damage to the Yangming, hearing the sound of wood can cause sudden fright.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>This may be due to the excessive fire of the year, or the decline of wood that year, or the conflict between wind and heat, or the interplay between metal and wood. One must examine the external pathogens and simultaneously treat the symptoms. If a person becomes ill from being startled, it is because the shock disrupts the qi, leaving the heart unsupported, the spirit unfocused, and the mind unsettled. This distress must arise from the loss of qi through sights and sounds. Thus, it is advisable to nurture the heart and spirit, and bolster the liver and gallbladder, focusing primarily on restoring the original qi.</p>
<p>In treating this, there is a distinction to be made; generally, those with strong qi are not easily startled, while those easily startled typically have insufficient liver and gallbladder strength. Therefore, even in the presence of external pathogens, one must understand the importance of addressing the root cause before the symptoms.</p>
<p>Moreover, when startled, the qi becomes chaotic; when fearful, the qi descends. Although fright and fear seem similar, the harm from fear is particularly severe compared to that from shock. Why? Because fright occurs suddenly and can be quickly resolved; fear accumulates gradually and cannot easily be dispelled. It can even lead to timidity and damage the spirit, causing an erosion of essence, which diminishes day by day, without cessation until death ensues. Only those with great courage and determination can uproot the root of this illness; merely relying on medicinal power is insufficient. I have treated ten cases of acute fright, with eight or nine fully recovering, while treatments for fear and anxiety have resulted in success for only one or two out of ten.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>For those suffering from fright, panic, and anxiety, although there are distinctions between the heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys, the yang governs the yin, and the heart is fundamentally rooted in the kidneys. Thus, when there is unrest above, it is invariably influenced by conditions below. When the heart&#39;s energy is deficient, it is always due to a deficiency in essence. This energy from the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys, despite their different names, is interrelated in treatment, due to the mutual roots of essence and energy, and the complete strength of the monarch and minister; however, sometimes it is advisable to prioritize energy over essence, or essence over energy. In some cases, where there is heat, it is better to clear it; where there is cold, it is better to warm it. This should also depend on the specific condition of the illness. Therefore, when utilizing formulas, they should be holistic, not hewn down to specifics.</p>
<p>When there is a deficiency in heart and spleen blood and energy, manifesting as fright, panic, or occasional severe shock leading to confusion of mind, the suitable remedy is the Seven Fortune Decoction, or in more severe cases, the Great Replenishing Decoction. If there is deficiency in the gate of life’s water, and true yin is insufficient, leading to persistent fright, the Left Return Decoction is appropriate. Conversely, if there is deficiency in the gate of life’s fire, and true yang is insufficient resulting in fright, the Right Return Decoction is indicated. If the three yin, essence, and blood are depleted, and there is insufficient yang within the yin leading to fright and panic, the Great Nutrient Decoction or the Regulating Yin Decoction should be used.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>If water is deficient and fire is excessive, causing agitation, heat, thirst, and restlessness, then administer the Er Yin decoction, possibly adjusting it with one more yin decoction. If excessive worry leads to damage of heart blood, resulting in agitation and fright, then use the Xiaoyao drink or the Yiying soup. If cold phlegm is stuck beneath the heart, causing agitation, then use the Jiangzhur decoction. </p>
<p>If heart deficiency and blood scarcity lead to unrest and fright, then use the Yangxin soup or the Ningzhi pill or the Shisiyou pill. If fear causes loss of spirit and unrest of the mind, then use the Ningzhi paste or the Yuanzhi pill. If there is insufficient heart blood and unclear liver fire, leading to excessive fright from heat, then use the Zhusha Anshen pill. If there is a deficiency of heart spirit and slight phlegm fire, resulting in agitation, then use the Bawudi Dingzhi pill. </p>
<p>If qi is stagnated in the heart with excessive phlegm leading to fright, then add the modified Siqi decoction. If phlegm obstructs the heart leading to fright, then administer the Wendan decoction or the Fuling drink; in severe cases, use the Zhushaxiao phlegm drink. If wind-heat generates phlegm that rises and causes fright, use the Jianyao Jizhong formula. </p>
<p>If great fear and terror damage the qi of the heart, spleen, and kidneys, resulting in depletion of spirit and essence, and a gradual decrease in appetite, then it is essential to use the Qifuding, Liyin decoction, or the Daying decoction, or the Dabuyuan decoction as necessary. However, it is vital to cleanse the heart and settle the thoughts to fully dispel the root of the illness, in order to ensure preservation of health.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety is not a disease of the heart; rather, it is due to the deficiency of liver blood that cannot nourish the heart. The prescription includes five cents each of white peony, angelica, ophiopogon, and cooked rehmannia, one tael of sour jujube seed, three cents of poria, one cent each of north cornelian cherry and distant will, and two cents of ginseng, to be boiled in water and taken as a decoction. The brilliance of this formula lies in not specifically treating the heart; treating the liver is precisely how to treat the heart, and treating the lung benefits the heart.</p>
<p>The kidney is the water organ; the heart is the fire organ. These two meridians, the heart and kidney, seem to be adversaries and ought not to be treated together. However, although the heart and kidney oppose each other, they actually rely on one another. Without the heart&#39;s fire, it becomes dead ash; without the kidney&#39;s water, it turns into ice and charcoal. The heart must receive kidney water to be nourished, and the kidney must have heart fire to be warmed. When a person is anxious and restless, isn’t it due to the heart and kidney not connecting? While others might consider anxiety and unrest as a heart issue, I view it as a kidney issue—not a reversal of logic, but rather a principle that is truly not easily overlooked.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The recipe uses five taels each of white atractylodes, lotus seed, tangerine peel, and cooked rehmannia; three taels each of ginseng, jujube seed, fried yam, prepared bai zi ren (biota seed), poria, dogwood, and ophiopogon; one tael each of northern five-flavor fruit, polygala, and calamus; and three qian of cardamom. Grind all into powder and make into pills with honey, to be taken with five qian of boiling water. The effectiveness of this pill lies in its treatment for the kidneys, less so for the heart. When the heart is tranquil, the kidney energy remains stable; when the kidney energy is stable, the heart is not disturbed. Thus, treating the heart is indeed a means of treating the kidneys, and treating the kidneys is likewise a way to treat the heart.</p>
<p>For heart-related ailments, such as distress and insomnia, this is due to a deficiency of heart blood. The recipe uses three qian each of ginseng, ophiopogon, poria, and angelica, two qian of red sage, and five qian each of raw and cooked jujube seeds, along with one qian each of calamus, licorice, and schisandra fruit, simmered in water for consumption. The effectiveness of this recipe lies in using five qian each of raw and cooked jujube seeds while employing nourishing heart herbs as adjuncts. The jujube seed is a supreme remedy for calming the heart and treating insomnia; the raw seed keeps one from sleeping during the day, while the cooked seed allows for peaceful nights without waking.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>When day and night are at peace, then the state of anxiety settles naturally, so why resort to remedies like tiger&#39;s eye, amber, or cinnabar? The symptoms of anxiety involve disturbance and restlessness, leading to a scattered mind and continuous palpitations, which are due to deficiency of the liver and kidneys and weakness of the heart&#39;s qi. If one resorts to phlegm treatment, it often leads to severe consequences. This is because kidney deficiency prevents the heart&#39;s qi from harmonizing, and heart deficiency further depletes the liver&#39;s qi. If one treats the phlegm instead of addressing the deficiency, how could death be avoided?</p>
<p>There is a formula called Tranquility Decoction, which includes five qian each of jujube seeds, ophiopogon, and white atractylodes, as well as one liang each of ginseng, white peony, cooked rehmannia, and bog bean, plus three qian of white mustard seed, all to be decocted and taken. This formula serves as a tonic for the heart, liver, and kidneys, harmonizing the three channels, allowing the yin and yang qi to interact, thereby settling the anxiety and completely alleviating the symptoms of palpitations and confusion.</p>
<p>Improper treatment of anxiety can lead to severe dangers. This condition often arises from seminal leakage accompanied by emotional distress, especially if one is careless about matters of attraction. It seems sensible to treat the kidneys primarily; however, why does strengthening the kidneys lead to increased anxiety? This happens because the liver becomes agitated, with its qi becoming overly vigorous; thus, supplementing the kidneys only causes the liver&#39;s qi to thrive further, which in turn exacerbates the heart&#39;s fire, leading to increased anxiety.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>However, can the heart not be replenished? If the heart is not replenished, the fire cannot be extinguished. By replenishing the heart and simultaneously using medications to clear the fire, one can achieve rejuvenation. The prescription uses Huazhong Dan, which includes two qian each of ginseng and jujube seed, five qian each of ophiopogon, white peony, original bellflower, and poria, one qian each of coptis and white mustard seed, and five fen of licorice, boiled in water for consumption. This formula is remarkable in not only calming the heart but also reducing fire; especially noteworthy is how it does not just descend liver fire but also nourishes the liver; even more remarkable is its capacity not to just replenish the kidney but also to nourish the lungs. The decrease of heart fire is exactly what calms the heart energy, and nourishing liver energy leads to a balanced liver, which in turn harmonizes the heart. Nourishing lung energy enables the lungs to thrive, thus controlling the exuberance of the liver meridian. When these methods are appropriately balanced, it naturally nourishes the heart energy, allowing for complete recovery from anxiety. </p>
<p>Forgetfulness is a sign of illness. The prescription uses three liang each of ginseng, fox nut, ophiopogon, jujube seed, angelica, and cornelian cherry; one liang each of schisandra, polygala, sweet flag, and biota seed without oil; five liang of cooked rehmannia, two liang of lotus beard, and four liang of yam, all ground into powder, formed into pills with honey. Each morning and evening, take five qian with boiling water, and recovery is achieved in half the time. </p>

For liver heat sickness, the urine first turns yellow, there is abdominal pain with much lying down, body heat, and when the heat is intense, there is madness and shock, fullness and pain in the flank, and restlessness in the limbs. If it reaches a severe state, there will be excessive sweating. If qi is reversed, it may lead to death. Prick the foot jueyin and shaoyang. If backward, it causes persistent headaches, with the pulse rising to the head. Do not prick those who are severely frightened.</p>
<p>If a person has fallen and has retained evil blood inside, with abdominal distension and inability to move forward or backward, first administer a mild laxative. This affects the jueyin pulse above and injures the shaoyin channel below. Prick below the inner ankle, where blood vessels emerge, and prick the artery on the top of the foot; if this does not alleviate, prick three points each on the upper parts until blood is drawn. Prick the left first, then the right, and vice versa. Those who are often saddened, frightened, or melancholic should be pricked according to the right method. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: In heat illness, with dry throat and much drinking, and frequent shock, where one cannot rise from lying down, prick the skin and flesh, using the sixth needle at fifty-nine. If the eyes are blue in the corners, seek flesh from the spleen, not from wood, as wood pertains to the liver. </p>

<p>Case Study</p>
<p>&quot;The Fundamental Prescriptions&quot; states: In the year of the Gui Chou of Shaoxing, I was in the city of Siming, where a man named Dong suffered from unsettled spirit energy. Each time he lay down, his soul would soar, sensing his body in bed but his spirit detached. He experienced fright and many nightmares, unable to sleep throughout the night. Other doctors were ineffective, so I proceeded to diagnose him. I asked: &quot;What kind of illness did the doctors treat?&quot; Dong replied, &quot;Everyone thinks it’s a heart illness.&quot; I said: &quot;From the pulse, the liver channel is afflicted, so it is not a heart illness. The liver energy is attacked by deficient evil energy. The liver stores the soul; when the wandering spirit changes, the healthy person’s liver does not suffer from evil and allows the soul to return to the liver efficiently, thus achieving calmness and sleep. Now, with evil in the liver, the soul cannot return, so while lying down, it feels as though the soul is soaring outside the body.&quot; The liver governs anger, thus even a little anger feels severe. Dong joyfully said: &quot;I have never heard this explanation before. Although I have not taken any medicine, I already feel my chronic illness beginning to leave my body.&quot;<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>I wish to seek treatment! I said: You should hold on to this statement and discuss it with other physicians regarding the method of treatment and then gradually inquire further. After ten days, you came back. You said that the physicians thoroughly discussed both ancient and modern formulas, but none corresponded to the illness. Therefore, I prescribed the Pearl Mother Pill and the Du Huo Decoction for you, and after a month, the illness was completely cured. This treatment uses Pearl Mother as the chief ingredient and Dragon&#39;s Tooth as an assistant. Pearl Mother primarily belongs to the liver channel, and Dragon&#39;s Tooth is similarly related to the liver. Dragon&#39;s Tooth and Tiger&#39;s Eye are often regarded by modern people as heart-calming medicines, yet they do not realize that Dragon&#39;s Tooth soothes the soul, while Tiger&#39;s Eye stabilizes the spirit, each referring to its nature. The eastern Azure Dragon represents wood, belonging to the liver, where the soul is housed. The western White Tiger represents metal, belonging to the lungs, where the spirit is housed. The dragon is capable of transformation, thus the soul wanders and remains undetermined; the tiger maintains composure, allowing the spirit to rest and be guarded. I believe to treat an unsettled spirit, one should use Tiger&#39;s Eye; to treat a wandering soul, one should use Dragon&#39;s Tooth. All things have a natural order which does not change, but it relies on individuals to comprehend it.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>The &quot;Ruzhong Shiqin&quot; states: Wei Dexin’s wife was staying overnight on a second floor while traveling, when thieves attacked and set fire to the place, causing her to fall from the bed in fright. From then on, whenever she heard a sound, she would be startled and unaware of people around her, and her family members would walk on tiptoe, daring not to make a sound. For over a year, she did not recover, and various doctors diagnosed her condition as a heart illness, treating her with ginseng, pearls, and calming pills, all without effect. </p>
<p>A healer observed her condition and concluded: &quot;Fright comes from outside; it is yang. Fear arises from within; it is yin. Fright is due to a lack of self-awareness, while fear comes from self-awareness. The gallbladder, belonging to the liver’s wood element, represents courage. If someone is frightened, it harms the gallbladder.&quot; He then instructed two maids to hold her hands and positioned a small table in front of her on a high chair. The healer said, &quot;Madam, you should look at this.&quot; He struck a piece of wood against the table, causing her to be greatly startled. The healer remarked, &quot;I struck the table with a piece of wood; why are you startled?&quot; After a moment of calm, he struck again, and her fright lessened. Again, he struck three to five more times, hit the door with a staff, and quietly sent someone to knock on the window behind a painting, gradually helping her calm down and laugh, saying, &quot;What is this treatment method?&quot; </p>
<p>The healer replied: &quot;The Inner Canon states: ‘Fright should be settled; settlement leads to normalcy.’ When one regularly encounters such things, there will be no fright.&quot; That night, he had someone knock on her doors and windows from dusk until dawn. For the frightened person, the spirit is elevated. By striking the table from below, she looks down, thus retrieving her spirit. After just a day or two, even if she heard thunder, she would not be frightened. Dexin had never liked the healer, but from then on, he respected him for life, to the extent that if anyone said the healer was incompetent in medicine, he would take up arms against them.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>The old man from the new village was fifty-nine years old. Due to a tax debt in autumn, he was hit with the official staff sixty times, which left him in shock and gave him a wind issue that had lasted for three years. When the illness intensified, his hands and feet trembled uncontrollably, rendering him unable to hold objects. He required someone to feed him, his mouth and eyes became dull, and his lips and tongue were in a sorry state. His trembling was like a marionette being pulled by strings, and whenever he had an episode, people in the market would gather to watch. At night, he experienced fever, discarding his clothes and bedding, with his whole body itching. He felt hot inside but cold outside, and for a long time wanted to end his life but couldn&#39;t even manage that. He sought medical help to the point of exhausting his family, yet his illness worsened.</p>
<p>The old man&#39;s son, a minor official in the town, informed a healer about his father&#39;s condition. The healer said that this illness was quite easy to treat. If it were still the peak of summer, a single eruption would suffice to cure him. Now that it was autumn and cooler, he suggested that three eruptions might be needed. If he did not get better, the healer could further stimulate acupuncture points to ensure recovery. They first used a sweat-inducing powder to promote perspiration, then administered an eruptive remedy that caused him to expel one or two liters of phlegm. By evening, he would also experience five to seven bowel movements, which slightly improved his condition. </p>
<p>After five days, another eruption expelled three to four liters of phlegm, resembling clumps of egg yolk and appearing as hot as soup. The old man, unable to observe this himself due to his shaking hands, had his wife check. His throat was swollen and painful, leaving him dazed like a drunk. After about an hour or two, he gradually regained some consciousness and had several more bowel movements. He immediately felt lighter, his trembling reduced, the fever subsided, and he could walk again. His hands regained the ability to hold a comb and a spoon. Before three eruptions occurred, his illness vanished as if washed away. </p>
<p>After recovering, he only felt extreme cold. The healer advised him to nourish himself with food, which would gradually help him recover. Indeed, after a major illness passes, the protective qi is not fully restored, so it is advisable to use medicines that dispel wind and guide qi. It is crucial not to use hot remedies to warm him, as that could lead to other ailments.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>A man, twenty-eight years old, sought treatment. He was weak, with limp limbs and a pale complexion. He felt pain in the left side of his body, radiating like an arm, with pain occurring at all times. His appetite was not diminished, his bowel movements were normal, and his urine was slightly yellow. This had persisted for two or three years. Various doctors had exhausted their methods and sought the help of a healer. Upon examination, it was found that the issue involved the foot Jueyin liver channel and was also related to the foot Shaoyang gallbladder channel. The healer stated: &quot;The liver corresponds to wood, and the gallbladder to fire; thus the green. The yellow represents the spleen.&quot; He diagnosed a weak gallbladder pulse, indicating a shock. Due to this shock, the gallbladder was afflicted, and there should be green phlegm in the abdomen. The patient mentioned that he had previously been in a military camp that caught fire, which marked the onset of his illness. The healer prepared one hundred fifty pills of Juanchuan powder, adding four to five qian of ginger juice, to be taken in the early morning. After ingestion, the patient expelled green phlegm four to five times. When asked about the large quantity of ginger, the healer replied: &quot;The spicy nature can cut through stagnation.&quot; After expelling phlegm, the patient felt slight pain and was instructed to expel once more, this time using a dosage reduced by one-third. He expelled green phlegm three to four times, after which the pain stopped, and he felt hungry and regained some strength. The healer then remarked to the patient: &quot;Your wife is also likely to be ill.&quot;<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>The divination said: The chief physician has not seen my wife, how can he know? He replied: How long have you been affected by this shock? The diviner reflected and said: When the fire struck, I was fast asleep in the cottage. I was startled awake by my family calling out, but I couldn&#39;t speak due to the shock; by then the fire had blocked the door, and my father pulled me out from the flames. It has been five years since then. Zhang said: Your courage is weakened by the great fright; the liver (gallbladder) is dominating the spleen (earth). This means the lesser yang fire is overpowering the spleen, and there is heat in the spleen, which destroys the grains you eat. Although the heat can transform the grains, the essence is not preserved, hence you will surely have no children. This causes the essence to fail and adversely affects the woman as well; therefore, your wife must have heat in her limbs, weakness in her extremities, and irregular menstrual flow. The diviner replied: My wife is indeed like this; it has also been five years. On another day, a disciple asked Zhang about the theory found in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding the relations of excess and deficiency in treatments. Zhang said: For instance, if wood affects the earth of the stomach, this earth cannot overcome the wood. The deficient energy seeks refuge in the child; the earth can generate metal (geng), which corresponds to the large intestine, while the spicy flavors represent metal; thus one uses a great quantity of ginger to overcome the wood. However, one must not first open the earth of the spleen, as it will not be able to function that way. Therefore, one first uses herbal pills to clear the blocked pathway, which treats what cannot be overcome first, and then ginger juice is used to enhance the laxative effect for subsequent treatment of what is overcome. Generally speaking, yang overcomes yang, the organs influence the organs, and the viscera influence the viscera.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: The son of Xianmu, Brother Fu, was around seventeen or eighteen years old. During the hot summer months, he became thirsty from exertion and excessively drank plum juice. Subsequently, he experienced three or four severe shocks, leading to delusions and hallucinations, as if afflicted by evil spirits. Upon examining his pulse, both hands exhibited a weak and string-like quality along with a heavy, rapid beat. I noted that the rapidity indicated heat, the weak and string-like quality pointed to severe shock, and the sour plum juice had stagnated in the middle burner. Therefore, to replenish the deficiency, clear the heat, and guide away the phlegm, the illness could be stabilized. I prescribed a concentrated decoction of ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, radish root, and lotus seeds, and added bamboo juice and ginger juice to it. After ten days without effect, the others speculated on the ineffectiveness of the medicine. After examining the pulse again, I recognized the deficiency had not been fully addressed and phlegm had not been expelled. I continued with the original formula and added a decoction of windbreaker (Jingli) and after another ten days, he was stable.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Scholar Lin was originally from the south and served as an official in the interior. He had a son who was very respectful and intelligent. His parents cherished him and often enjoyed eating sea clams; they would set them out at meals without fail. When the son turned eighteen, his complexion suddenly turned pale and his body became emaciated. He often experienced fright and restlessness at night, and everyone thought he suffered from a wasting disease. Despite numerous treatments, he did not improve, so they called in Du Maizhi. Du said: &quot;It is not a disease.&quot; When asked how he knew, he explained: &quot;Although his face is pale and he is emaciated, his spirit remains undiminished. Ask the young scholar what he likes to eat.&quot; The scholar replied: &quot;I particularly enjoy eating various sea delicacies.&quot; Du said: &quot;If you consume too many salty foods from the sea, it will cause thirst, which is a sign of blood depletion. Since you eat so much salty food, your heart and blood gradually weaken, leading to fright and restlessness at night. Now that you&#39;ve avoided salty foods and are using medicines to generate body fluids, since one is still young, blood replenishment will be easier, and your complexion will gradually regain its reddish hue. Once this condition is resolved, you will find peace.&quot; The other physicians believed it to be a wasting disease, but that was not the correct treatment.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>The &quot;Case Records of Xue Ji&quot; states: Gu Ren, a resident of Xiabao, is sixty-one years old. After suffering from diarrhea, he entered the bedroom, leading to involuntary emission for two days. Subsequently, he felt cold due to excessive sexual activity, which resulted in chills and fevers, pain in the right side affecting the heart and chest, abdominal distension, spontaneous sweating, and profuse night sweats. His limbs became cold, and he experienced frightful dreams while sleeping; at times he felt a rising sensation as if floating, and at other times a sinking feeling as if falling, which caused him to lose sleep. Taking two doses of tonic medicine only made it worse. His pulse was floating, large, and rapid; upon pressing, it felt weak and fine. This indicated a lack of fire and a deficiency of heat. I urgently prescribed a dose of &quot;Ten Complete Tonics&quot; with added Chinese yam, shan zhu yu, dan pi, and fu zi. All symptoms promptly improved, leading to recovery. Such are the vital energies that can rarely go wrong.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Vital Essence Connecting to the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The yang energy, when refined, nourishes the spirit; when gentle, it nurtures the tendons. If it cannot open and close effectively, and cold energy invades, severe stooping may occur. A sinking pulse indicates a fistula, lingering in the flesh; the nourishing energy becomes thin, leading to feelings of great fear and shock.<br><strong>[Note: The back is associated with yang; if yang is deficient, cold pathogens obstruct the back, causing the body to hunch, as mentioned in the &quot;Jinkui.&quot; This refers to conditions where the back is afflicted. If yang is weak and cannot protect the nourishing blood, pathogens sink into the pulse, forming a fistula, lingering between the flesh. This refers, in the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; to conditions likened to a knife-like swelling. When the energy of the channels becomes thin and weak, it can affect the internal organs and disturb the spirit. The heart governs the pulse; if the spirit is harmed, fear and loss of control result. The liver governs blood, thus its ailments manifest in fear and shock.</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>On the True Words of the Jinkui</strong></p>
<p>The eastern blue color connects to the liver, opens at the eyes, and stores essence in the liver. Such ailments manifest as fear and shock.<br><strong>[Note: In spring, the yang energy rises, leading to conditions appearing as sudden shock due to the surge of energy.]</strong></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In spring, the encounter with autumn equinox results in constricted tendons and reversed energy, manifesting as coughing. This illness does not heal, causing people to be startled and even weep.<br>[Note: The liver, associated with wood in the east, tends to provoke fright. As the liver stores the soul, an unsettled spirit causes people to cry out.]</p>
<p>In autumn, the encounter with spring equinox continues the illness, making people vigilant and eager to act, yet they rise and forget their intentions.<br>[Note: Autumn tends to descend, and its encounter with spring equinox reverses the upward flow of blood and energy, stirring restlessness and forgetfulness.]</p>
<p>In the case of the Yangming, when it is at its end, the mouth and eyes move involuntarily, resulting in startled and nonsensical speech. The color turns yellow, signaling a depletion of the upper and lower channels.<br>[Note: The Yangming meridians of the hands and feet are associated with the mouth and eyes, resulting in involuntary actions. Hearing sounds from wood leads to startlement, which is characteristic of Yangming. Speaking abusively without regard for kinship reflects nonsensical speech typical of Yangming. The yellow color is a manifestation of the earth energy of Yangming spilling out. The uprisen and downfallen channels signify the depletion of stomach energy without softness, and a lack of sensation in the skin indicates a deficiency in the protective energy.]</p>
<p>Discussion of meridians</p>
<p>Experiencing fright disturbs the breath, causing it to escape from the lungs, and the errant energy harms the heart.<br>[Note: Fright disrupts energy, leading to breath escaping from the lungs. The lungs cover the heart, thus errant energy injures the heart.]</p>
<p>Startlement depletes vitality, causing sweat to emerge from the heart.<br>[Note: Blood is the essence of the heart, and sweat is the fluid of the blood. Startlement injures the heart&#39;s energy, resulting in sweat from the heart, hence the description of the depletion of essence.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p>For those suffering from water-related ailments, they cannot lie down; if they do, it leads to shock, and such shock greatly intensifies coughing.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The evil of the kidneys affects the stomach, hence one cannot lie down.

<p>When shocked, the heart has no support, the spirit has no place to return, and thoughts cannot settle, leading to chaotic energy.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Shock causes the heart’s energy to disperse without a place to rely on, the mind wanders without a home, and thoughts are confused without resolution, hence the chaotic energy.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Bi Syndrome</h3>
<p>For those with liver bi syndrome, significant shock occurs at night when lying down.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The liver houses the soul; when lying down, the spirit is unsettled, thus leading to shock.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Syncope</h3>
<p>Lesser Yang syncope causing intestinal abscesses is untreatable; those in shock are doomed.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The lesser Yang&#39;s fire governs energy, and when it reverses within, it leads to intestinal abscesses. &quot;Untreatable&quot; means the disease is within the energy realm, while the abscess is internal, making needling ineffective. If shock occurs, the toxic energy affects the organs, leading to death. </p>
<p>Greater Yang syncope results in wheezing, coughing, body heat, heightened fear, and epistaxis with hematemesis.<br><strong>Note:</strong> When the energy of greater Yang is constrained, it causes wheezing; if it reverses, it leads to coughing. The energy of greater Yang governs musculature, hence the body heat. The classics say: &quot;When both Yang energies manifest illness, fear ensues.&quot; The presence of blood in the nose and vomiting blood is due to the hot energy of greater Yang being constrained and forcing blood to move erratically.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>Three Yang and one Yin; when the Taiyin pulse prevails, one Yin cannot stop, causing internal chaos in the five organs and external fright. </p>
<p><strong>Pulsation Explanation</strong></p>
<p>In Yangming, it is said that excessive conditions lead to collapse; wicked people are akin to fire, and when they hear the sound of wood, they become startled and alarmed. This is because the Yang energy and Yin energy are at odds, with water and fire being antagonistic, hence the startle and alarm.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>The liver is obstructed, both sides full, causing fright when lying down, preventing urination.<br>(This is due to illness in the liver channel, hence both sides are full and urination is obstructed.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The rapid and chaotic pulse of the liver must come from a shock. The two Yang energies are urgent and cause fear. When the pulse is fast, it can easily startle a person, and this can last for three to four days before self-recovery. The formless energy rising against the normal flow causes the pulse to become fast. When the pathogen is shallow and affects the heart, it leads to a shock. </p>
<p>Both the kidney and liver wanting to be startled indicate a depletion of blood and Qi, represented by the thin pulse. The energy of the liver is generated in the kidney, and the thin pulse signifies the depletion of energy from both organs, leading to a desire to be shocked.</p>
<p>In cases of excessive recovery of the Sun, it can reach the heart, causing forgetfulness and deep sadness. When the Shen gate is obstructed, it leads to death without treatment. The forgetfulness and sadness stem from the stomach affecting the heart. </p>
<p>In the case of the lesser Yang being victorious, heat invades the stomach, causing excessive fear and delirium, and if it worsens, this leads to shock with cough and epistaxis. When heat invades the heart and lungs, it leads to fear and other symptoms. </p>
<p>The excessive recovery of the greater Yang can affect the liver, leading to fear and muscle spasms. If the illness penetrates the liver, it greatly affects the organ. When the organ is distressed, it represents a state of being half-alive and half-dead. </p>
<p>All illnesses associated with fear relate to fire. This fire comes from the lesser Yang&#39;s relationship with the fiery dynamic. When the fire is excessive, the heart&#39;s spirit becomes unsettled, causing fear.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The True Discussion on the Jade Mechanism</h3>
<p>When the spring pulses are excessive, it causes forgetfulness and sudden dizziness along with headaches.<br>[Note: The excessive spring pulse causes the Qi to rise.

<h3>The Discussion on Acupuncture According to the Four Seasons</h3>
<p>When needling the meridians in autumn, the blood and Qi rise inversely, causing forgetfulness.<br>[Note: Autumn signifies descending and gathering, which turns to promote growth, thus the blood and Qi rise inversely and lead to forgetfulness.]  </p>
<p>When needling the muscles in winter, the Yang Qi becomes exhausted, causing forgetfulness.<br>[Note: Winter signifies closure of the organs. Needling the muscles extracts the latent Qi from the flesh, leading to the exhaustion of the Yang Qi within and causing forgetfulness.]  </p>
<p>When the Yangming is sluggish, it leads to accumulated diseases and frequent fright.<br>[Note: Sluggishness indicates more blood and less Qi, with slight cold. Frequent fright suggests that the disease resides in the blood.]</p>
<h3>The Discussion on the Five Excesses</h3>
<p>For those yet to be diagnosed with a disease, one must differentiate between the consistently wealthy and the subsequently impoverished. Even if not afflicted by an evil spirit, illness arises from within, termed &quot;loss of essence.&quot; Consistent wealth followed by poverty is termed &quot;loss of vital essence.&quot; When the five Qi linger, diseases may coexist. The physician diagnoses them, but they do not involve the organs, nor do they change the shape of the body, leading to uncertainty in diagnosing and an inability to identify the disease by name. The body diminishes daily, with Qi being empty and lacking essence; the disease is deep and lacks Qi, resulting in occasional fright. For those with deep-seated maladies, it is due to external consumption of the protective Qi and internal depletion of the nourishing Qi. A skilled physician may not recognize the true nature of the illness; this is an error in treatment.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Wealth often comes after poverty, and honor comes after disgrace; this can harm one&#39;s aspirations and intentions, leading to internal ailments even if not due to external evils. The spleen houses essence, which embodies intention; the kidneys store essence, which embodies will. Therefore, when intentions are lost, and essence is detached, it causes distress. The five energies linger, referring to the spiritual energies of the five organs, which become stagnant within and do not circulate freely. &quot;Concurrence&quot; refers to diseases affecting the five organs. The energies of the five organs correspond externally to the skin, muscles, tendons, and bones; hence, the body gradually weakens. When there is a deficiency of energy and essence, and diseases are deep without vital energy, it indicates that energy arises from essence, and essence arises from energy—the conjunction of essence and energy leads to harm. For example, when someone experiences prolonged wealth and honor but unexpectedly loses it, they may feel shocked. This ailment does not reside in the organs or the body shape; it is a daily depletion of essence and energy. Even with a skilled physician, if the cause is not understood, it reflects a flaw in treatment. </p>
<p><strong>Generative Treatise of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse arrives white, it indicates wheezing and floating; the upper part is vacuous, and the lower part is solid, resulting in astonishment. <strong>Note:</strong> When breathing is rapid, the pulse is also rapid. The lungs govern qi, so the pulse is floating due to deficiency. There is illness in qi but not in blood; the disease is in the upper but not in the lower, hence the pulse is vacuous above and solid below. When yang energy is deficient, it easily leads to shock.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

Water qi ascends, making the body not thin. Wind and water evils encroach upon the earth&#39;s qi, hence the inability to eat, and even if eating, it is not much.

<p>There are four types of diseases arising from shock: running piglet syndrome, purulent vomiting, fright, and fiery evil. All these conditions result from shock. The master said: running piglet syndrome originates from the lower abdomen, surging upward to the throat, resulting in a near-death experience followed by cessation, all stemming from fear. The patient speaks in a quiet manner, startled by sudden sounds, indicating joint issues. </p>
<p>For men whose complexion is thin, this indicates thirst and blood loss, resulting in sudden palpitations. A floating pulse indicates internal deficiency; when there&#39;s weakness in the interior, it may lead to palpitations, nosebleeds, abdominal pain, loss of semen in dreams, aching limbs, heat in the hands and feet, and dryness of the throat. Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction treats this. Water resides in the kidneys, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.</p>
<p>If a patient drinks excessively, they will definitely experience sudden palpitations. Generally, eating little while drinking a lot can cause water to accumulate beneath the heart; in severe cases, this leads to palpitations, while in milder cases, it results in shortness of breath. A double-string pulse indicates coldness, which signifies a significant deficiency after purging. A biased string pulse suggests fluid retention.</p>
<p>For sudden vomiting, a feeling of fullness beneath the heart, and water accumulation in the diaphragm, along with dizziness and palpitations, Banxia Jia Fuling Decoction should be prescribed. A pulse that is weak and moves indicates shock; weak pulses signify palpitations. For palpitations beneath the heart, Banxia Mahuang Wan should be administered.</p>

<p>The sound of the pulse indicates the state of the heart. If the heart&#39;s sound is cheerful, it has a pleasant tone; the intention is happiness, correlating to the Lesser Yin Meridian. If there is counterflow in the Sun Meridian, the protective and nourishing energies are obstructed, resulting in a reversal of yin and yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The state of fright and palpitations arises from a deficiency of the heart and a lack of courage. The heart is the sovereign organ, from which the spirit emerges; courage governs decisiveness. When the heart is tranquil and the spirit is not fearful, one can think clearly and make good decisions. Sometimes, due to a significant shock, an illusory sound, or an unusual sight, one may experience fear while facing danger, which can agitate the heart and spirit, causing stagnation of energy and saliva, resulting in fright and palpitations. If fright persists, various symptoms may arise, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, sweating, swelling in the limbs, loss of appetite, agitation of the heart, and restless sitting or lying down—all signs of a deficient heart and lack of courage. The method of treatment is to calm the heart and strengthen the spirit; then, there will be no ailments left untreated. The state of disorientation indicates a deficiency of heart blood. The heart governs blood, and blood is the master of the heart; when blood is abundant, the heart can rest assured.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Many are eager to attain wealth and nobility, yet fear poverty and low status. When thoughts dwell on loved ones, unexpected events arise, causing true blood to be depleted, leading to disturbances in the heart. The mind of the sovereign loses its support, gradually causing confusion and anxiety. This persistent confusion gives rise to various ailments: a strong tongue yet foggy in perception, prone to worry and sadness, lacking vitality—these are signs of mental illness. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;Nourishing the heart benefits its glory.&quot; Thus, one should primarily replenish true blood. When true blood is abundant, the heart has support, and there is no ailment that cannot be cured. There are also instances of catching wind, cold, heat, and humidity, which block various meridians and lead to confusion; excessive intake of liquids can stagnate the stomach, also causing confusion. One must treat according to the symptoms presented.</p>
<p>As for forgetfulness, it often involves a tendency for joyful oblivion. The spleen governs intention and thoughts, while the heart also rules thinking. When thought is excessive, intentions become unclear, and the spirit&#39;s palace is not functionally active, leading to forgetfulness. The method for harmonizing this is to regulate both heart and spleen, ensuring tranquility of the spirit, thereby restoring awareness.</p>
<p>Causes of Shock Illness</p>
<p>Shock arises when the heart suddenly stirs and becomes unsettled. Fire is associated with movement, thus the heart fire becomes intensely hot. Nevertheless, this is merely extreme heat within; when fire reaches its peak, it resembles water, causing surprise. Conversely, when kidney water is undermined by fear, excess leads to harm; this is a matter of balance. The saying &quot;fear leads to surprise&quot; indicates that fear damages the kidneys and depletes water, thereby intensifying heart fire and resulting in surprise. A combination of yin and yang leading to fright results in back pain and sighing, referred to as Wind Disturbance. The stomach and spleen correspond to earth, while the liver corresponds to wood—wood overcomes earth. When wind dominates and dampness does not regulate kidney water, it causes an upward reversal.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Clear Theory</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heart Palpitations</strong>  </p>
<p>In cases of heart palpitations due to cold damage, how should one clarify this? Palpitations occur when the heart is weak. When one feels anxious and cannot find peace, this defines palpitations. The causes of heart palpitations fall into two categories: one is qi deficiency, and the other is stagnant fluid. In cases of cold damage lasting two or three days, if the person experiences palpitations accompanied by restlessness, the prescription is Xiao Jian Zhong Tang. If someone with a Shaoyin condition has severe palpitations, add five grams of cinnamon to Si Ni San. This indicates palpitations due to qi deficiency. If one drinks too much water, it will inevitably lead to palpitations below the heart, indicating palpitations due to stagnant fluid. The qi deficiency occurs because of weak yang energy within, leaving the heart below empty, causing internal movement of the righteous qi, which leads to palpitations. Stagnant fluid results from water accumulating below the heart; since the heart is fire and dislikes water, when water is stationary within, the heart&#39;s inability to find peace causes palpitations. Furthermore, after sweating or purging, if the righteous qi is internally weak and the evil qi strikes against it, this can also cause palpitations. In cases of yangming disease, if excessive sweating occurs, the individual may experience palpitations with a pressed heart and the hands crossed over the chest. If yangming illness leads to purging, and the body feels heavy with palpitations below the heart, one should not induce sweating.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Shao Yang disease should not be treated with vomiting or purging; doing so will lead to palpitations and fright. The Shao Yang disease should not be treated with sweating; sweating will cause delirium. This pertains to the stomach: when the stomach is harmonious, recovery occurs; when the stomach is not harmonious, there will be agitation and palpitations. These symptoms arise from the lingering邪 (evil) after sweating, and those with qi deficiency and palpitations are distinct. Some conditions require stabilization, others require dispersion, all must be assessed to see if the qi is floating.</p>
<p>Additionally, excessive drinking causes water to accumulate, which can lead to palpitations. The &quot;Essentials from the Golden Cabinet&quot; states that when one eats little but drinks excessively, water can accumulate in the heart and lead to severe palpitations. Drinking causes palpitations more than other evils; even if other evils are present, one must first treat the palpitations. Why? Because when water accumulates in the heart, if the water vapor disperses, it can affect various organs: in the lungs, it leads to wheezing and coughing; in the stomach, it causes belching and choking; on the skin, it causes swelling; in the intestines, it leads to diarrhea. This cannot be treated lightly.</p>
<p>The classics say: when there are palpitations under the heart with a cold sensation, one should first treat the water condition, using Poria and Licorice Decoction, and then treat the cold sensation. Otherwise, the water will infiltrate the stomach and cause diarrhea. When the cold sensation is of deep origin, one should still treat the water condition first; how much more so for those with a shallow evil qi!<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>For fright and palpitations caused by blood deficiency, use Zhu Sha An Shen Wan. For phlegm obstructing the heart and diaphragm, any phlegm remedy will do, combined with Ding Zhi Wan, adding amber and turmeric. For sudden palpitations, this is also due to blood deficiency. Sudden palpitations that come and go indicate a lack of blood. Those with worries and disturbances belong to the deficient category. If it occurs intermittently, it is due to phlegm influenced by fire. Lean individuals often suffer from blood deficiency, while overweight individuals are related to phlegm. Generally, phlegm is more common. True awareness of heart palpitations indicates blood deficiency; remedies such as Si Wu and Zhu Sha An Shen can be used. If the illness arises from fright, this leads to a dispersion of the spirit; if the spirit departs, phlegm will arise. What governs a person is the heart, and what nourishes the heart is blood. When heart blood is deficient, the spirit cannot be contained, thus marking the onset of fright and palpitations. Is there no distinction between fright and palpitations? &quot;Fright&quot; refers to fear, while &quot;palpitations&quot; refer to sudden disturbances.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the heart is vacuous and there is phlegm, one may hear loud noises and see strange objects, and in times of danger may lose resolve, causing the heart to be agitated, resulting in a state of fright. When the heart is vacuous and water stagnates, there will be seepage within the chest, and the vacuous qi flows. When the water rises to the top, the heart&#39;s fire despises it, leading to unrest in the heart, which causes a feeling of depression; this is called palpitations. For fright, one uses a formula to expel phlegm and settle fright; for palpitations, a formula to expel water and dissolve fluids should be used. What is called supporting the vacuity merely involves nourishing the heart&#39;s blood and harmonizing the heart&#39;s qi. Forgetfulness often arises from a deficiency of spirit, and in some cases, also from phlegm. These conditions result from excessive worry and anxiety, damaging the heart&#39;s nurturing, leading to unclear consciousness and frequent forgetfulness, indicating that the issue lies within the heart and spleen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Li Zhen]</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Overthinking and severe shock can lead to a deficiency of the heart, resulting in phlegm stagnation, or hearing loud sounds and seeing unusual objects may provoke fear and palpitation. In extreme cases, this can lead to a sensation of impending collapse and a weak, thready pulse, indicating deficiency. For blood deficiency, use Si Wu Decoction, Fu Shen Decoction, Miao Xiang Powder, or Zhu Sha An Shen Pills. If both qi and blood are deficient, use Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction or Yang Xin Decoction. If symptoms appear intermittently, it is phlegm; use Er Chen Decoction with Bai Zhu, Huang Lian, Yuan Zhi, Zhu Li, and ginger juice. </p>
<p>Long-lasting palpitations due to shock are caused by phlegm below and fire above. Use Wen Dan Decoction with Huang Lian, Shan Zhi, Dang Gui, and Bei Mu. For qi stagnation, use Si Qi Decoction with Fu Shen, Yuan Zhi, Zhu Li, and ginger juice, or Ten Flavor Wen Dan Decoction or Jin Bo Zhen Xin Pills. If there are symptoms of phlegm accumulation causing a rumbling sound in the chest and a feeling of unease, use Er Chen Decoction with Fu Shen, Bing Lang, Mai Men Dong, and Chen Xiang, or Zhu Que Pills. </p>
<p>For the two types of palpitations, commonly used are Gui Pi Decoction, Ren Shu Powder, Meng Shou Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, Shou Xing Pills, or Shen Zao Pills.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Palpitations are movements caused by external evil energies disturbing the heart, akin to someone trying to catch something, leading to a state of confusion and anxiety. When there is water stagnating beneath the heart, dizziness and trembling occur, and if one faints and experiences palpitations, it is because the water has permeated, and the palpitations and fainting can be stabilized. Those with a weak spirit and essentially empty heart, who cannot maintain their composure, may sweat, leading to internal emptiness and palpitations which are even more severe than the just empty-hearted individuals. One must first stabilize the energy before treating the palpitations. Generally, those who feel anxious first and then have palpitations are considered deficient, and should use Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction or Zhen Wu Decoction. For those with a weak pulse, Shi Gan Cao Decoction with a little wine is appropriate. Those who feel dizzy after sweating should take Gui Zhi Gan Cao Decoction. If palpitations come before anxiety, it indicates heat, and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is recommended. For those with a propensity to vomit, rambling speech, and difficult bowel movements, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with a bit more Da Huang or a little Mang Xiao is indicated. For those with rambling speech and difficulty in urination, Chai Hu Long Gu Mu Li Decoction is suitable. Those with red urine should take Wu Ling San. </p>
<p>If confusion persists for a long time, it leads to forgetfulness, indicating a deficiency of heart and spleen blood, and insufficient clear energy. The condition results from turbid energy rising and mistaking the spirit for the true essence. There may also be inherent deficiencies; for those prone to forgetfulness, one should greatly replenish their qi and blood and use Ding Zhi Wan. For older individuals with declining spirit, Jia Jian Gu Ben Wan should be included, additionally using Gui Pi Decoction, Ren Shu San, Meng Shou Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, Shou Xing Wan, or Shen Jiao Wan.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>It is noted that external dangers can cause shock; those with strong hearts and courage cannot be harmed, while those with weak hearts easily become startled. This shock may lead to phlegm due to stagnation, and when phlegm and qi clash, various symptoms may arise, such as shortness of breath or spontaneous sweating, which can be treated with the Warm Gallbladder Decoction. If there is vomiting, ginseng can be used instead of bamboo shavings. If one has numerous strange dreams causing sudden waking, add jujube seeds and lotus seeds to the Warm Gallbladder Decoction, decocted with gold and silver. Other remedies include the Tranquil Heart Pill, the Forgetting Will Pill, the Wonderful Fragrance Powder, the Amber Heart-Nourishing Pill, and the Decisive Will Pill. For frequent night terrors and vocalizations during sleep, use Mother of Pearl Pill or the Angelica Decoction. If startled unexpectedly, heavy tranquilizers should be administered; a fine powder of the mystic temple monk&#39;s herb can be mixed with tea, or the Huanglian Tranquil Heart Pill can be utilized. For heat-induced phlegm, use the Cold Water Stone Powder, or if phlegm arises from qi stagnation, add flavors to the Four-Seven Decoction.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

Control the saliva using Dan with cinnabar and distant will. The classic states: When the heart is obstructed, the pulse does not flow. When agitated, the area below the heart feels like a drum, as it is closed and does not circulate. The illness is due to heat stagnating and producing saliva; when the saliva forms, there is restlessness and the area below the heart pulsates. The pulsation is akin to the beating of a drum. For the five obstruction decoction, add Fushen, distant will, and Banxia. According to the classics and the &quot;Original Patterns of Illness&quot;: when water is deficient and fire is excessive, the chest is agitated, and the Tianwang Heart-Supplementing Pill is indicated. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: When the heart is fiery and dislikes water, and water is stagnant below the heart, creating a throbbing sensation, one cannot settle; deal with it using Banxia Mahuang Pill or Fuling Drink. If there has been sweating, vomiting, or purging resulting in deficiency of righteous Qi leading to palpitations and inability to lie down, Warm Gallbladder Decoction is appropriate.

The pulse at the inch position is agitated; generally, during fright, the pulse stops and then returns. The person&#39;s eyes do not move, and they are unable to breathe out. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the origin of forgetfulness is attributable to the failure of the heart and kidneys to communicate. The heart does not descend to connect with the kidneys, causing turbidity and chaos in the spirit. The kidneys do not ascend to connect with the heart, leading to a lack of vital energy. When fire remains above, it causes phlegm; when water is below, it results in restlessness. Thus, there is confusion, and one cannot attain tranquility. Therefore, tonifying the kidneys and allowing them to rise, nourishing the heart and enabling its proper descent can lead to clarity of spirit and stable intent, eliminating forgetfulness. Overthinking is addressed with Gui Pi Decoction. Mental fatigue is treated with Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction and Ning Zhi Ointment. Phlegm obstructing the heart orifices is remedied by guiding phlegm decoction paired with Shou Xing Pills. For the failure of heart and kidney communication, Zhu Que Pill is used.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about the distinctions between agitation, palpitations, and fear, and it was said: Palpitations are the same as agitation. Agitation, in essence, arises from a lack of calmness within the heart. Surprise, on the other hand, is caused by an external stimulus. Zhang Zihe said: Surprise results from ignorance of oneself; fear arises from self-awareness. Indeed, surprise occurs when one hears a sound causing alarm, while fear comes from self-awareness, as in the case when one feels they might be caught and cannot sit or lie down alone without needing a companion to feel secure. Some might even need a light at night; if no candle or lamp is available, they feel fear. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; does not mention surprise and fear, as it begins from the &quot;Golden Coffer Prescriptions,&quot; which states: &quot;There is surprise followed by fear&quot;; it adds that surprise and fear become apparent. Surprise and fear refer to the same concept of alarm and dread, and fear also implies apprehension, thus sharing a similar meaning. Generally, when both names are mentioned together as a framework, it pertains to the interplay of yin and yang. For instance, when joy and anger are mentioned together, joy emanates from the heart (yang), while anger arises from the liver (yin). When will and intention are discussed together, will is static and unchanging (yin), while intention is dynamic and unstable (yang). Static indicates yin, while dynamic indicates yang.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Fear and shock arise when external events disturb the inner mind. When the heart is moved, the spirit becomes unsettled; when there is confusion from outside, it frustrates one&#39;s aspirations, leading to a retreat of one&#39;s essence. Thus, in the Inner Canon it is said: when shocked, the heart has nowhere to rely on, the spirit has nowhere to return, and thoughts cannot settle, causing the qi to be disrupted. In fear, the essence retreats, leading to the closure of the upper burner; when closed, there is no qi returning; without qi returning, the lower burner becomes swollen, causing the qi to stagnate. It is also said: experiencing wealth after poverty or distress after happiness, sorrow and worry being internally bound, may lead to the loss of essence and a deep-rooted illness with insufficient qi, resulting in a sudden shock. Such cases are all illnesses that arise from external events disturbing the inner heart and spirit. </p>
<p>As for the internal balance of yin and yang affecting shock and fear, shock is caused by fire and heat agitating the heart; when the heart is disturbed, the spirit becomes chaotic, and the spirit’s use lacks direction. Thus, the manifestations of shock vary and depend on the individual, corresponding with the five spirits. The liver houses the hun (ethereal soul); when the hun is unsettled, it causes alarm and delusion. The lung houses the po (corporal soul); when the po is restless, it leads to agitation. The spleen houses the yi (intellect); when the yi is not focused, it causes confusion. The kidney houses will; when the will is frustrated, it leads to fear and trepidation. Although the stomach has no spirit, it is considered the sea of the five organs; when numerous heat energies return to it, it results in shock and mania. For instance, upon hearing the sound of wood, the heart may tremble and yearn to move. Fear, then, arises as heat injures the kidneys; when the kidneys are harmed, the essence becomes deficient; when the essence is deficient, there is insufficient will. Since the will is originally steady and unchanging, fear does not exhibit other forms.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; regarding the disease caused by shock, there are two types of heat and fire. The qi of the celestial controller is related to the reaction of the springs, which leads to various heat-related illnesses in different channels, as well as the accumulation of the three yang and the qi combining with the yang, all of which contribute to shock and similar ailments. Therefore, in a general sense, it is said that all diseases of shock derive from fire.</p>
<p>For the fear-induced illness, it arises from the essence and qi combining in the kidneys, leading to fear. A deficiency in blood can also cause fear. If there is a deficiency in yin, the yang will intrude upon it, causing them to clash, resulting in fear. Furthermore, if the stomach qi is hot and the kidney qi is weak, fear can occur, regardless of whether the kidneys are compromised.</p>
<p>However, when the liver is involved, the shock and fear may interact, as the liver’s qi belongs to the yang while residing in the yin, storing blood and the soul. If the soul is unsettled, the spirit becomes agitated; when the spirit is agitated, shock occurs. A deficiency in blood leads to discontent, and discontent leads to fear. Hence, both conditions are attributed to the liver.</p>
<p>Similar situations arise from the two types of heat, attributed to external pathogenic influences. Other forms of shock and fear arise from the internal fluctuations of a person&#39;s qi in relation to yin and yang. However, it is not solely about the two forms of heat. When there is a rapid pulse in the yangming channel, this too can induce shock.</p>
<p>It is queried whether the diseases of shock and fear, arising from internal and external causes, have the same or different treatment methods. It is stated that for shock, one should pacify the spirit; for fear, one should stabilize the will. Treatment should distinguish between yin and yang, hence they cannot be treated alike.</p>
<p>The changes in the I Ching depict the interaction of the heavens and the earth, with the hexagrams of Kan and Li arranged, leading to their interplay resulting in a completed state, corresponding to the five organs of the human body.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart represents the fire of separation, with inward yin and outward yang; the kidney represents the water of the abyss, with inward yang and outward yin. The internal is the master, and the external is the application. The internal masters are the five spirits, while the external applications are the five energies. Therefore, the heart governs with the spirit as the master and uses yang; the kidney governs with will as the master and uses yin. Yang corresponds to qi and fire; yin corresponds to essence and water. When water and fire are harmonized, it all relies on nourishing the spirit with yin essence, while storing yang qi below to stabilize the will. Otherwise, the spirit will be restless internally, yang qi will disperse externally, the will will be disturbed internally, and yin essence will flee below, and with the distinction between the two organ&#39;s water and fire, how can the treatment not differ in some way? Thus, for those who are startled, one must first calm their spirit; only then can the scattered qi be gathered. When qi is gathered, the yang pathway can function. For those who are fearful, one must first stabilize their will; only then can the fleeing essence be secured. When essence is secured, the yin qi can function. Regarding medicine, the two organs have distinct roles as sovereign, minister, and assistants in their usage, and the effects felt from the internal and external are not so different. For those startled by external matters, although Ziheshi mentions that the startled should be made calm, which is common practice, allowing the patient to hear and become accustomed to it so that they are naturally unstartled is indeed a good method. However, it is better to bring peace to the heart and ease the qi beforehand, and then use medicine. I say that, for internal qi affecting the spirit, one should not employ Zhang’s method but should instead use medicine to balance the rise and fall of yin and yang, after which the spirit can be calmed and the will can be stabilized.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

The causes of heart palpitations fall into two types: one is deficiency, and the other is excess intake. </p>
<p>In cases of qi deficiency, it arises from the internal weakness of yang qi, resulting in an empty heart space where the internal heat causes palpitations. The same applies to blood deficiency. Cases of fluid retention occur when water stagnates below the heart, where the heart, being related to fire, repels water. When water is stagnant, the heart cannot find peace, resulting in palpitations. </p>
<p>After sweating, vomiting, or purging, if the vital energy is internally deficient, palpitations may occur; if there is an invasion of pathogenic energy, palpitations may also arise; and if there is a depletion of the nourishing and defending energies leading to pulse irregularities, the condition worsens. It is essential to generate bodily fluids and nourish blood to alleviate deficiency, especially when discussing febrile diseases. </p>
<p>Regarding mixed diseases, one may refer to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which states that in heart obstruction, there is a lack of pulse circulation, leading to discomfort in the chest. In cases of gallbladder disease, symptoms include bitter taste in the mouth, vomiting of residual bile, and a feeling of fear and anxiety as if one is about to be captured. The yangming channel is associated with movement; upon hearing wood sounds, one may feel startled; the pericardium is also linked to movement, with symptoms manifesting as great agitation in the heart; the kidneys relate to movement as well, presenting with heightened feelings of fear, resembling the sensation of impending capture.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yuan Bing Shi&quot; states: When water diminishes and fire rises, the heart and chest become agitated, which is termed &quot;zhengchong&quot; (anxiety). Then it is understood that palpitations are a sickness, stemming from the heart&#39;s energy being out of balance, with movements creating fire pathogens. The heart is the lord fire, and the pericardium is the minister fire. Fire is yang, and yang is active. Below the lord fire, the yin essence supports it; below the minister fire, the water qi supports it. When these energies move correctly, they maintain purity and brightness, vital for life. If there is a lack of support, the lord fire becomes excessive and unbalanced, turning into restlessness and heat, while the minister fire moves erratically, bringing about both heat and motion. Is it not evident that this leads to symptoms of palpitations? Moreover, the heart is where the spirit resides. The classics say that the interaction of the two essences is termed spirit, and also state that blood and qi are the spirit of a person, indicating that yin and yang, qi and blood, are never separate from the heart. If one loses the yin, tilting towards yang, the yang becomes disorganized and scattered due to the loss of its support, thus the spirit becomes unsettled and anxious. In such cases, one should replenish the deficient heart blood from within the heart to soothe the spirit; if this fails, one should seek to weaken the excess while reinforcing the water element to restrain the yang energy. Furthermore, the fire of the pericardium not only aids the heart but also circulates in the five organs; hence, any erratic movement of qi in the organs is also due to fire. Therefore, when each organ is ill, they can all act in concert with the fire of the pericardium, causing palpitations.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In such cases, one should identify the source of the heat arising from each organ, and thereafter adjust and balance the protective layer according to what is beneficial for treatment. If the heat from various organs moves to the heart and causes the fire of the protective layer to ignite, the treatment should also follow this principle. If the heart&#39;s qi is insufficient, and the kidney&#39;s water surges upward to stagnate in the heart, it is necessary to overcome the counteracting qi, drain excess water, and nourish the yang. If the true water of the left kidney is insufficient, and the fire of the right kidney rises and interacts with the protective layer, one must vigorously replenish the yin of the left kidney to counteract it. If internal and external evils stifle the two fires, preventing them from surging forth and blocking the nourishment of the correct qi, treatment should primarily focus on dispelling the evils and resolving the stagnation. If phlegm and fluid stagnate in the middle-jiao, obstructing the meridians and preventing smooth flow, and if the stifled fire collides with phlegm beneath the heart, causing palpitations, one must clear the phlegm, and once the meridians are flowing, the illness will resolve. </p>
<p>Human temperament is inherently different; when one obtains clear qi, the heart’s perception is bright, while when one acquires turbid qi, the heart’s perception becomes dull. The clarity of the heart has no limits; even matters from a thousand or a hundred generations past, once seen, will be remembered for a lifetime and not forgotten—how could one forget what is currently at hand? Conversely, the dullness of the heart results in limited spirit; thus, in the face of current matters, one cannot recall past events.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Liu Hejian stated that water is clear and bright while fire is dark and turbid, hence the highest virtue resembles water, while the lowest folly resembles fire; this is due to inherent qualities. If one&#39;s disposition is muddled, they cannot endure the disturbances of the world, and when disturbed, they lose their spirit and become forgetful. Indeed, qi and blood are the essence of a person. The classics say: &quot;In tranquility, the spirit is hidden; in agitation, it dissipates.&quot; Tranquility is the nature of water, while agitation is the function of fire. Therefore, when one&#39;s nature is tranquil, the heart remains centered; when emotions stir, the heart forgets the inside and becomes distracted by the outside. If agitation does not cease, forgetfulness also continues; if forgetfulness persists, the essence within becomes rare. If the essence within becomes rare, one often forgets the spoken words, even before a day has passed. Thus, many in the world forget because they are preoccupied, disturbed, and entangled in the affairs of life; their qi and blood become depleted, particularly if one&#39;s inherent qualities are above the average, and they maintain clarity that is not disturbed by external affairs, such a person is exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>From this, it can be inferred that while medicine certainly has the function of calming the heart and nourishing the blood, it is less effective than achieving peace of mind, easing one&#39;s qi, and nurturing one&#39;s inner self. On the other hand, forgetfulness linked to phlegm is a temporary ailment; however, the causes of forgetfulness are not solely phlegm. Anything that the heart is attached to, combined with the heat of various fires that disrupts the heart, can lead to forgetfulness. As stated in the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; great anger harms the will, and the will suffers from forgetfulness. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: &quot;Blood gathers below while qi gathers above; when in chaos, forgetfulness ensues.&quot; In this case, how can one not address each cause separately for treatment?<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Proof</strong></p>
<p>The ailment of frightful palpitations is characterized by a trembling heart and chest, a continual state of alarm and fear, leaving one unable to find peace at any time. However, in ancient times, there was no such name for this condition. In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it describes a major channel of the stomach called &quot;Xu Li,&quot; located beneath the left breast, whose movement corresponds to clothing and represents a leakage of vital energy. In the texts of the Yue people and Zhongjing, there is a differentiation of moving energies in the upper and lower regions, stating that all such energies should not be sweated out. All these conditions are indeed types of frightful palpitations. This symptom is only found in those who suffer from Yin deficiency and overexertion. When Yin is deficient below, the vital energy has no root, and so it does not return to its source; thus, it floats and shakes in the chest above and vibrates beside the navel below. Those with mild deficiency will experience minor movements, while those with severe deficiency will experience intense movements. Those afflicted should promptly regulate desires and labor, and strictly abstain from alcohol and sensual pleasures. In treatment, one should promptly nurture energy and essence and reinforce the foundation. If one mistakenly believes this to be phlegm-fire and mistakenly implements purging treatments, it will hasten their danger. </p>
<p>There are two types of fright: one that arises from illness and one that arises from fright leading to illness. For example, when the eastern color is green, it communicates with the liver, causing alarming symptoms; also, in cases of cold damage to the Yangming, hearing the sound of wood can cause sudden fright.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This may be due to the excessive fire of the year, or the decline of wood that year, or the conflict between wind and heat, or the interplay between metal and wood. One must examine the external pathogens and simultaneously treat the symptoms. If a person becomes ill from being startled, it is because the shock disrupts the qi, leaving the heart unsupported, the spirit unfocused, and the mind unsettled. This distress must arise from the loss of qi through sights and sounds. Thus, it is advisable to nurture the heart and spirit, and bolster the liver and gallbladder, focusing primarily on restoring the original qi.</p>
<p>In treating this, there is a distinction to be made; generally, those with strong qi are not easily startled, while those easily startled typically have insufficient liver and gallbladder strength. Therefore, even in the presence of external pathogens, one must understand the importance of addressing the root cause before the symptoms.</p>
<p>Moreover, when startled, the qi becomes chaotic; when fearful, the qi descends. Although fright and fear seem similar, the harm from fear is particularly severe compared to that from shock. Why? Because fright occurs suddenly and can be quickly resolved; fear accumulates gradually and cannot easily be dispelled. It can even lead to timidity and damage the spirit, causing an erosion of essence, which diminishes day by day, without cessation until death ensues. Only those with great courage and determination can uproot the root of this illness; merely relying on medicinal power is insufficient. I have treated ten cases of acute fright, with eight or nine fully recovering, while treatments for fear and anxiety have resulted in success for only one or two out of ten.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>For those suffering from fright, panic, and anxiety, although there are distinctions between the heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys, the yang governs the yin, and the heart is fundamentally rooted in the kidneys. Thus, when there is unrest above, it is invariably influenced by conditions below. When the heart&#39;s energy is deficient, it is always due to a deficiency in essence. This energy from the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys, despite their different names, is interrelated in treatment, due to the mutual roots of essence and energy, and the complete strength of the monarch and minister; however, sometimes it is advisable to prioritize energy over essence, or essence over energy. In some cases, where there is heat, it is better to clear it; where there is cold, it is better to warm it. This should also depend on the specific condition of the illness. Therefore, when utilizing formulas, they should be holistic, not hewn down to specifics.</p>
<p>When there is a deficiency in heart and spleen blood and energy, manifesting as fright, panic, or occasional severe shock leading to confusion of mind, the suitable remedy is the Seven Fortune Decoction, or in more severe cases, the Great Replenishing Decoction. If there is deficiency in the gate of life’s water, and true yin is insufficient, leading to persistent fright, the Left Return Decoction is appropriate. Conversely, if there is deficiency in the gate of life’s fire, and true yang is insufficient resulting in fright, the Right Return Decoction is indicated. If the three yin, essence, and blood are depleted, and there is insufficient yang within the yin leading to fright and panic, the Great Nutrient Decoction or the Regulating Yin Decoction should be used.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p>Anxiety is not a disease of the heart; rather, it is due to the deficiency of liver blood that cannot nourish the heart.

The brilliance of this formula lies in not specifically treating the heart; treating the liver is precisely how to treat the heart, and treating the lung benefits the heart.</p>
<p>The kidney is the water organ; the heart is the fire organ. These two meridians, the heart and kidney, seem to be adversaries and ought not to be treated together. However, although the heart and kidney oppose each other, they actually rely on one another. Without the heart&#39;s fire, it becomes dead ash; without the kidney&#39;s water, it turns into ice and charcoal. The heart must receive kidney water to be nourished, and the kidney must have heart fire to be warmed. When a person is anxious and restless, isn’t it due to the heart and kidney not connecting? While others might consider anxiety and unrest as a heart issue, I view it as a kidney issue—not a reversal of logic, but rather a principle that is truly not easily overlooked.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<p>There is a formula called Tranquility Decoction, which includes five qian each of jujube seeds, ophiopogon, and white atractylodes, as well as one liang each of ginseng, white peony, cooked rehmannia, and bog bean, plus three qian of white mustard seed, all to be decocted and taken. This formula serves as a tonic for the heart, liver, and kidneys, harmonizing the three channels, allowing the yin and yang qi to interact, thereby settling the anxiety and completely alleviating the symptoms of palpitations and confusion.</p>
<p>Improper treatment of anxiety can lead to severe dangers. This condition often arises from seminal leakage accompanied by emotional distress, especially if one is careless about matters of attraction. It seems sensible to treat the kidneys primarily; however, why does strengthening the kidneys lead to increased anxiety? This happens because the liver becomes agitated, with its qi becoming overly vigorous; thus, supplementing the kidneys only causes the liver&#39;s qi to thrive further, which in turn exacerbates the heart&#39;s fire, leading to increased anxiety.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, can the heart not be replenished? If the heart is not replenished, the fire cannot be extinguished. By replenishing the heart and simultaneously using medications to clear the fire, one can achieve rejuvenation. The prescription uses Huazhong Dan, which includes two qian each of ginseng and jujube seed, five qian each of ophiopogon, white peony, original bellflower, and poria, one qian each of coptis and white mustard seed, and five fen of licorice, boiled in water for consumption. This formula is remarkable in not only calming the heart but also reducing fire; especially noteworthy is how it does not just descend liver fire but also nourishes the liver; even more remarkable is its capacity not to just replenish the kidney but also to nourish the lungs. The decrease of heart fire is exactly what calms the heart energy, and nourishing liver energy leads to a balanced liver, which in turn harmonizes the heart. Nourishing lung energy enables the lungs to thrive, thus controlling the exuberance of the liver meridian. When these methods are appropriately balanced, it naturally nourishes the heart energy, allowing for complete recovery from anxiety. </p>
<p>Forgetfulness is a sign of illness. The prescription uses three liang each of ginseng, fox nut, ophiopogon, jujube seed, angelica, and cornelian cherry; one liang each of schisandra, polygala, sweet flag, and biota seed without oil; five liang of cooked rehmannia, two liang of lotus beard, and four liang of yam, all ground into powder, formed into pills with honey. Each morning and evening, take five qian with boiling water, and recovery is achieved in half the time. </p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 taels of cinnabar</li>
<li>Sweet and bitter herbs boiled together</li>
<li>Ginseng</li>
<li>Fried bitter gourd seeds</li>
<li>Steamed and roasted prepared cooked rehmannia</li>

</ul>
<p>Preparation method:<br>Combine the fourteen ingredients, grind, and mix thoroughly. Then take the cinnabar and mix it while hot, storing it in a silk bag tightly sewn shut with hemp thread. Use a clay pot, placing a weighted silver container inside. Add 20 pounds of white honey and hang the medicine bag in the center, ensuring it does not touch the bottom, allowing the honey to soak the bag. Use mulberry wood to keep it boiling continuously for three days until the honey turns dark and black. Replace the honey and cook for another seven days, then stop the fire and remove the concoction, discarding the herbs and cleaning the cinnabar until dry. Place it inside beef heart and steam again in the silver container. If the broth gets low, add hot water from the side of the pot. Continue steaming until the heart is soft, then replace the cinnabar and repeat the steaming process for a total of seven times. Once the cinnabar is cooked, rinse it in boiling water until clean and dry it. Grind it in a mortar until it is very fine, then form balls the size of peas using glutinous rice paste. Let them dry in the shade. The dosage is twenty balls, taken after meals with ginseng soup, jujube soup, or ophiopogon soup as preferred.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the left hand closes the passage of Yang (which means it relates to vitality), there is no gallbladder pulse, yielding knee pain, bitterness in the mouth, squinting eyes in fear as if seeing ghosts, experiencing many scares and little strength. Needling the foot&#39;s Jue Yin point (which is associated with the liver) treats the Yin; this is done between the big toe or at the middle of the three hair folicles (in the foot). </p>
<p>&quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Medicine&quot; states: when the heart is flickering and beating rapidly, reducing the flow, moxibustion works effectively. For forgetfulness, use the points of the Hidden Gaps, Heart Shu, Spirit Gate, Central Pass, and Three Miles, and moxibustion on the Lesser Sea.</p>
<p>Case Study</p>
<p>&quot;The Fundamental Prescriptions&quot; states: In the year of the Gui Chou of Shaoxing, I was in the city of Siming, where a man named Dong suffered from unsettled spirit energy. Each time he lay down, his soul would soar, sensing his body in bed but his spirit detached. He experienced fright and many nightmares, unable to sleep throughout the night. Other doctors were ineffective, so I proceeded to diagnose him. I asked: &quot;What kind of illness did the doctors treat?&quot; Dong replied, &quot;Everyone thinks it’s a heart illness.&quot; I said: &quot;From the pulse, the liver channel is afflicted, so it is not a heart illness. The liver energy is attacked by deficient evil energy. The liver stores the soul; when the wandering spirit changes, the healthy person’s liver does not suffer from evil and allows the soul to return to the liver efficiently, thus achieving calmness and sleep. Now, with evil in the liver, the soul cannot return, so while lying down, it feels as though the soul is soaring outside the body.&quot; The liver governs anger, thus even a little anger feels severe. Dong joyfully said: &quot;I have never heard this explanation before. Although I have not taken any medicine, I already feel my chronic illness beginning to leave my body.&quot;<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I wish to seek treatment! I said: You should hold on to this statement and discuss it with other physicians regarding the method of treatment and then gradually inquire further. After ten days, you came back. You said that the physicians thoroughly discussed both ancient and modern formulas, but none corresponded to the illness. Therefore, I prescribed the Pearl Mother Pill and the Du Huo Decoction for you, and after a month, the illness was completely cured. This treatment uses Pearl Mother as the chief ingredient and Dragon&#39;s Tooth as an assistant. Pearl Mother primarily belongs to the liver channel, and Dragon&#39;s Tooth is similarly related to the liver. Dragon&#39;s Tooth and Tiger&#39;s Eye are often regarded by modern people as heart-calming medicines, yet they do not realize that Dragon&#39;s Tooth soothes the soul, while Tiger&#39;s Eye stabilizes the spirit, each referring to its nature. The eastern Azure Dragon represents wood, belonging to the liver, where the soul is housed. The western White Tiger represents metal, belonging to the lungs, where the spirit is housed. The dragon is capable of transformation, thus the soul wanders and remains undetermined; the tiger maintains composure, allowing the spirit to rest and be guarded. I believe to treat an unsettled spirit, one should use Tiger&#39;s Eye; to treat a wandering soul, one should use Dragon&#39;s Tooth. All things have a natural order which does not change, but it relies on individuals to comprehend it.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ruzhong Shiqin&quot; states: Wei Dexin’s wife was staying overnight on a second floor while traveling, when thieves attacked and set fire to the place, causing her to fall from the bed in fright. From then on, whenever she heard a sound, she would be startled and unaware of people around her, and her family members would walk on tiptoe, daring not to make a sound. For over a year, she did not recover, and various doctors diagnosed her condition as a heart illness, treating her with ginseng, pearls, and calming pills, all without effect. </p>
<p>A healer observed her condition and concluded: &quot;Fright comes from outside; it is yang. Fear arises from within; it is yin. Fright is due to a lack of self-awareness, while fear comes from self-awareness. The gallbladder, belonging to the liver’s wood element, represents courage. If someone is frightened, it harms the gallbladder.&quot; He then instructed two maids to hold her hands and positioned a small table in front of her on a high chair. The healer said, &quot;Madam, you should look at this.&quot; He struck a piece of wood against the table, causing her to be greatly startled. The healer remarked, &quot;I struck the table with a piece of wood; why are you startled?&quot; After a moment of calm, he struck again, and her fright lessened. Again, he struck three to five more times, hit the door with a staff, and quietly sent someone to knock on the window behind a painting, gradually helping her calm down and laugh, saying, &quot;What is this treatment method?&quot; </p>
<p>The healer replied: &quot;The Inner Canon states: ‘Fright should be settled; settlement leads to normalcy.’ When one regularly encounters such things, there will be no fright.&quot; That night, he had someone knock on her doors and windows from dusk until dawn. For the frightened person, the spirit is elevated. By striking the table from below, she looks down, thus retrieving her spirit. After just a day or two, even if she heard thunder, she would not be frightened. Dexin had never liked the healer, but from then on, he respected him for life, to the extent that if anyone said the healer was incompetent in medicine, he would take up arms against them.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The old man from the new village was fifty-nine years old. Due to a tax debt in autumn, he was hit with the official staff sixty times, which left him in shock and gave him a wind issue that had lasted for three years. When the illness intensified, his hands and feet trembled uncontrollably, rendering him unable to hold objects. He required someone to feed him, his mouth and eyes became dull, and his lips and tongue were in a sorry state. His trembling was like a marionette being pulled by strings, and whenever he had an episode, people in the market would gather to watch. At night, he experienced fever, discarding his clothes and bedding, with his whole body itching. He felt hot inside but cold outside, and for a long time wanted to end his life but couldn&#39;t even manage that. He sought medical help to the point of exhausting his family, yet his illness worsened.</p>
<p>The old man&#39;s son, a minor official in the town, informed a healer about his father&#39;s condition. The healer said that this illness was quite easy to treat. If it were still the peak of summer, a single eruption would suffice to cure him. Now that it was autumn and cooler, he suggested that three eruptions might be needed. If he did not get better, the healer could further stimulate acupuncture points to ensure recovery. They first used a sweat-inducing powder to promote perspiration, then administered an eruptive remedy that caused him to expel one or two liters of phlegm. By evening, he would also experience five to seven bowel movements, which slightly improved his condition. </p>
<p>After five days, another eruption expelled three to four liters of phlegm, resembling clumps of egg yolk and appearing as hot as soup. The old man, unable to observe this himself due to his shaking hands, had his wife check. His throat was swollen and painful, leaving him dazed like a drunk. After about an hour or two, he gradually regained some consciousness and had several more bowel movements. He immediately felt lighter, his trembling reduced, the fever subsided, and he could walk again. His hands regained the ability to hold a comb and a spoon. Before three eruptions occurred, his illness vanished as if washed away. </p>
<p>After recovering, he only felt extreme cold. The healer advised him to nourish himself with food, which would gradually help him recover. Indeed, after a major illness passes, the protective qi is not fully restored, so it is advisable to use medicines that dispel wind and guide qi. It is crucial not to use hot remedies to warm him, as that could lead to other ailments.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

He felt pain in the left side of his body, radiating like an arm, with pain occurring at all times. His appetite was not diminished, his bowel movements were normal, and his urine was slightly yellow. This had persisted for two or three years. Various doctors had exhausted their methods and sought the help of a healer. Upon examination, it was found that the issue involved the foot Jueyin liver channel and was also related to the foot Shaoyang gallbladder channel. The healer stated: &quot;The liver corresponds to wood, and the gallbladder to fire; thus the green. The yellow represents the spleen.&quot; He diagnosed a weak gallbladder pulse, indicating a shock. Due to this shock, the gallbladder was afflicted, and there should be green phlegm in the abdomen. The patient mentioned that he had previously been in a military camp that caught fire, which marked the onset of his illness. The healer prepared one hundred fifty pills of Juanchuan powder, adding four to five qian of ginger juice, to be taken in the early morning. After ingestion, the patient expelled green phlegm four to five times. When asked about the large quantity of ginger, the healer replied: &quot;The spicy nature can cut through stagnation.&quot; After expelling phlegm, the patient felt slight pain and was instructed to expel once more, this time using a dosage reduced by one-third. He expelled green phlegm three to four times, after which the pain stopped, and he felt hungry and regained some strength. The healer then remarked to the patient: &quot;Your wife is also likely to be ill.&quot;<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The divination said: The chief physician has not seen my wife, how can he know? He replied: How long have you been affected by this shock? The diviner reflected and said: When the fire struck, I was fast asleep in the cottage. I was startled awake by my family calling out, but I couldn&#39;t speak due to the shock; by then the fire had blocked the door, and my father pulled me out from the flames. It has been five years since then. Zhang said: Your courage is weakened by the great fright; the liver (gallbladder) is dominating the spleen (earth). This means the lesser yang fire is overpowering the spleen, and there is heat in the spleen, which destroys the grains you eat. Although the heat can transform the grains, the essence is not preserved, hence you will surely have no children. This causes the essence to fail and adversely affects the woman as well; therefore, your wife must have heat in her limbs, weakness in her extremities, and irregular menstrual flow. The diviner replied: My wife is indeed like this; it has also been five years. On another day, a disciple asked Zhang about the theory found in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding the relations of excess and deficiency in treatments. Zhang said: For instance, if wood affects the earth of the stomach, this earth cannot overcome the wood. The deficient energy seeks refuge in the child; the earth can generate metal (geng), which corresponds to the large intestine, while the spicy flavors represent metal; thus one uses a great quantity of ginger to overcome the wood. However, one must not first open the earth of the spleen, as it will not be able to function that way. Therefore, one first uses herbal pills to clear the blocked pathway, which treats what cannot be overcome first, and then ginger juice is used to enhance the laxative effect for subsequent treatment of what is overcome. Generally speaking, yang overcomes yang, the organs influence the organs, and the viscera influence the viscera.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

Subsequently, he experienced three or four severe shocks, leading to delusions and hallucinations, as if afflicted by evil spirits. Upon examining his pulse, both hands exhibited a weak and string-like quality along with a heavy, rapid beat. I noted that the rapidity indicated heat, the weak and string-like quality pointed to severe shock, and the sour plum juice had stagnated in the middle burner. Therefore, to replenish the deficiency, clear the heat, and guide away the phlegm, the illness could be stabilized. I prescribed a concentrated decoction of ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, radish root, and lotus seeds, and added bamboo juice and ginger juice to it. After ten days without effect, the others speculated on the ineffectiveness of the medicine. After examining the pulse again, I recognized the deficiency had not been fully addressed and phlegm had not been expelled.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Case Records of Xue Ji&quot; states: Gu Ren, a resident of Xiabao, is sixty-one years old. After suffering from diarrhea, he entered the bedroom, leading to involuntary emission for two days. Subsequently, he felt cold due to excessive sexual activity, which resulted in chills and fevers, pain in the right side affecting the heart and chest, abdominal distension, spontaneous sweating, and profuse night sweats. His limbs became cold, and he experienced frightful dreams while sleeping; at times he felt a rising sensation as if floating, and at other times a sinking feeling as if falling, which caused him to lose sleep. Taking two doses of tonic medicine only made it worse. His pulse was floating, large, and rapid; upon pressing, it felt weak and fine. This indicated a lack of fire and a deficiency of heat. I urgently prescribed a dose of &quot;Ten Complete Tonics&quot; with added Chinese yam, shan zhu yu, dan pi, and fu zi. All symptoms promptly improved, leading to recovery. Such are the vital energies that can rarely go wrong.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

This illness does not heal, causing people to be startled and even weep. [Note: The liver, associated with wood in the east, tends to provoke fright. As the liver stores the soul, an unsettled spirit causes people to cry out.] In autumn, the encounter with spring equinox continues the illness, making people vigilant and eager to act, yet they rise and forget their intentions. [Note: Autumn tends to descend, and its encounter with spring equinox reverses the upward flow of blood and energy, stirring restlessness and forgetfulness.] In the case of the Yangming, when it is at its end, the mouth and eyes move involuntarily, resulting in startled and nonsensical speech. The color turns yellow, signaling a depletion of the upper and lower channels. [Note: The Yangming meridians of the hands and feet are associated with the mouth and eyes, resulting in involuntary actions. Hearing sounds from wood leads to startlement, which is characteristic of Yangming. Speaking abusively without regard for kinship reflects nonsensical speech typical of Yangming.

The imbalance of yin and yang causes fear and anxiety. The heart’s energy rises in the lungs, where metal fears fire and heat, resulting in severe coughing. ### Treatise on Pain When shocked, the heart has no support, the spirit has no place to return, and thoughts cannot settle, leading to chaotic energy. **Note:** Shock causes the heart’s energy to disperse without a place to rely on, the mind wanders without a home, and thoughts are confused without resolution, hence the chaotic energy. ### Treatise on Bi Syndrome For those with liver bi syndrome, significant shock occurs at night when lying down. **Note:** The liver houses the soul; when lying down, the spirit is unsettled, thus leading to shock. ### Treatise on Syncope Lesser Yang syncope causing intestinal abscesses is untreatable; those in shock are doomed. **Note:** The lesser Yang's fire governs energy, and when it reverses within, it leads to intestinal abscesses. \"Untreatable\" means the disease is within the energy realm, while the abscess is internal, making needling ineffective. If shock occurs, the toxic energy affects the organs, leading to death. Greater Yang syncope results in wheezing, coughing, body heat, heightened fear, and epistaxis with hematemesis. **Note:** When the energy of greater Yang is constrained, it causes wheezing; if it reverses, it leads to coughing. The energy of greater Yang governs musculature, hence the body heat.

This is because the Yang energy and Yin energy are at odds, with water and fire being antagonistic, hence the startle and alarm. **Discussion on the Five Constants** The chronicle of harmony leads to fright. (Here, an evil force damages the liver.) The chronicle of hidden brightness leads to symptoms of confusion, sorrow, and forgetfulness, stemming from water's transformation. (Confusion, sorrow, and forgetfulness arise from insufficient spirit energy.) In the Taiyang realm, cold air descends, the heart's energy ascends, and hot energy moves aimlessly, leading to forgetfulness. (Cold air descends while organ energy ascends, and hot energy moves aimlessly, hence the spirit is harmed, leading to forgetfulness.) **Discussion on Great Oddities** The liver is obstructed, both sides full, causing fright when lying down, preventing urination. (This is due to illness in the liver channel, hence both sides are full and urination is obstructed. The obstruction of organ energy leads to a restless spirit, causing fright.) The liver pulse is restless and violent, leading to fright and alarm."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"The rapid and chaotic pulse of the liver must come from a shock. The two Yang energies are urgent and cause fear. When the pulse is fast, it can easily startle a person, and this can last for three to four days before self-recovery. The formless energy rising against the normal flow causes the pulse to become fast. When the pathogen is shallow and affects the heart, it leads to a shock. Both the kidney and liver wanting to be startled indicate a depletion of blood and Qi, represented by the thin pulse. The energy of the liver is generated in the kidney, and the thin pulse signifies the depletion of energy from both organs, leading to a desire to be shocked. In cases of excessive recovery of the Sun, it can reach the heart, causing forgetfulness and deep sadness. When the Shen gate is obstructed, it leads to death without treatment. The forgetfulness and sadness stem from the stomach affecting the heart. In the case of the lesser Yang being victorious, heat invades the stomach, causing excessive fear and delirium, and if it worsens, this leads to shock with cough and epistaxis. When heat invades the heart and lungs, it leads to fear and other symptoms. The excessive recovery of the greater Yang can affect the liver, leading to fear and muscle spasms. If the illness penetrates the liver, it greatly affects the organ. When the organ is distressed, it represents a state of being half-alive and half-dead. All illnesses associated with fear relate to fire. This fire comes from the lesser Yang's relationship with the fiery dynamic. When the fire is excessive, the heart's spirit becomes unsettled, causing fear."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"### The True Discussion on the Jade Mechanism When the spring pulses are excessive, it causes forgetfulness and sudden dizziness along with headaches. [Note: The excessive spring pulse causes the Qi to rise. The Classic says: When Qi rises, it becomes chaotic and leads to forgetfulness. The Qi is abundant and meets the governing vessel at the top, resulting in dizziness and headaches.] ### The Discussion on Acupuncture According to the Four Seasons When needling the meridians in autumn, the blood and Qi rise inversely, causing forgetfulness. [Note: Autumn signifies descending and gathering, which turns to promote growth, thus the blood and Qi rise inversely and lead to forgetfulness.] When needling the muscles in winter, the Yang Qi becomes exhausted, causing forgetfulness. [Note: Winter signifies closure of the organs. Needling the muscles extracts the latent Qi from the flesh, leading to the exhaustion of the Yang Qi within and causing forgetfulness.] When the Yangming is sluggish, it leads to accumulated diseases and frequent fright. [Note: Sluggishness indicates more blood and less Qi, with slight cold. Frequent fright suggests that the disease resides in the blood.] ### The Discussion on the Five Excesses For those yet to be diagnosed with a disease, one must differentiate between the consistently wealthy and the subsequently impoverished. Even if not afflicted by an evil spirit, illness arises from within, termed \"loss of essence.\" Consistent wealth followed by poverty is termed \"loss of vital essence.\" When the five Qi linger, diseases may coexist. The physician diagnoses them, but they do not involve the organs, nor do they change the shape of the body, leading to uncertainty in diagnosing and an inability to identify the disease by name. The body diminishes daily, with Qi being empty and lacking essence; the disease is deep and lacks Qi, resulting in occasional fright. For those with deep-seated maladies, it is due to external consumption of the protective Qi and internal depletion of the nourishing Qi. A skilled physician may not recognize the true nature of the illness; this is an error in treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**Note:** Wealth often comes after poverty, and honor comes after disgrace; this can harm one's aspirations and intentions, leading to internal ailments even if not due to external evils. The spleen houses essence, which embodies intention; the kidneys store essence, which embodies will. Therefore, when intentions are lost, and essence is detached, it causes distress. The five energies linger, referring to the spiritual energies of the five organs, which become stagnant within and do not circulate freely. \"Concurrence\" refers to diseases affecting the five organs. The energies of the five organs correspond externally to the skin, muscles, tendons, and bones; hence, the body gradually weakens. When there is a deficiency of energy and essence, and diseases are deep without vital energy, it indicates that energy arises from essence, and essence arises from energy—the conjunction of essence and energy leads to harm. For example, when someone experiences prolonged wealth and honor but unexpectedly loses it, they may feel shocked. This ailment does not reside in the organs or the body shape; it is a daily depletion of essence and energy. Even with a skilled physician, if the cause is not understood, it reflects a flaw in treatment. **Generative Treatise of the Five Organs** When the pulse arrives white, it indicates wheezing and floating; the upper part is vacuous, and the lower part is solid, resulting in astonishment. **Note:** When breathing is rapid, the pulse is also rapid. The lungs govern qi, so the pulse is floating due to deficiency.

What illness is this? Qibo said: The illness arises from the kidneys, known as kidney wind. Kidney wind leads to an inability to eat and is prone to shock. Once shocked, if the heart's qi is weak, death follows. *Annotation: The foot's lesser yin cold water governs qi; a large pulse indicates wind, and a tense pulse indicates cold. In the case of water wind illness, external symptoms show bone and joint pain, yet this illness resides in the kidneys. It is not caused by external wind evils, hence there is no bodily pain. Water qi ascends, making the body not thin. Wind and water evils encroach upon the earth's qi, hence the inability to eat, and even if eating, it is not much. Being prone to shock indicates that water qi invades the heart.

Its ailments include dizziness and sudden fright in the sides. Sudden fright comes from Shaoyin, while restlessness arises from Shaoyang. This is common to summer illnesses. **The Chapter on Blood, Qi, Form, and Will** The state of fear and terror disrupts the channels; illness arises from a lack of benevolence. It should be treated with massage and medicinal decoctions. Fear causes disruption of qi, and terror causes qi to descend. Since blood follows the movement of qi, when qi is disordered and moving in reverse, the channels are obstructed and the nourishing and protective energies do not function, leading to sickness arising from a lack of benevolence.

The waist corresponds to the kidneys, hence the inability to bend and stretch.] **Discussion on Great Confusion** The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes a person to be prone to forgetfulness? Qibo replied: There is insufficient energy above and excess energy below; the intestines and stomach are full while the heart and lungs are deficient. When deficient, the nutrients cannot rise in time, thus causing frequent forgetfulness.

All these conditions result from shock. The master said: running piglet syndrome originates from the lower abdomen, surging upward to the throat, resulting in a near-death experience followed by cessation, all stemming from fear. The patient speaks in a quiet manner, startled by sudden sounds, indicating joint issues. For men whose complexion is thin, this indicates thirst and blood loss, resulting in sudden palpitations. A floating pulse indicates internal deficiency; when there's weakness in the interior, it may lead to palpitations, nosebleeds, abdominal pain, loss of semen in dreams, aching limbs, heat in the hands and feet, and dryness of the throat. Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction treats this. Water resides in the kidneys, leading to palpitations beneath the heart. If a patient drinks excessively, they will definitely experience sudden palpitations. Generally, eating little while drinking a lot can cause water to accumulate beneath the heart; in severe cases, this leads to palpitations, while in milder cases, it results in shortness of breath. A double-string pulse indicates coldness, which signifies a significant deficiency after purging. A biased string pulse suggests fluid retention. For sudden vomiting, a feeling of fullness beneath the heart, and water accumulation in the diaphragm, along with dizziness and palpitations, Banxia Jia Fuling Decoction should be prescribed. A pulse that is weak and moves indicates shock; weak pulses signify palpitations. For palpitations beneath the heart, Banxia Mahuang Wan should be administered.

If a patient suddenly drinks a lot of water, they will certainly suffer from violent coughing and fullness.

Pain occurs in the skin intermittently, resembling the sensation of lice, and in severe cases, it feels like needle pricks along with intermittent itching and a pale color. In people of gentle nature, they may groan and easily become angry; when angry, they tend to forget and seem lost in thought. This indicates the earth damaging water.

When thoughts dwell on loved ones, unexpected events arise, causing true blood to be depleted, leading to disturbances in the heart. The mind of the sovereign loses its support, gradually causing confusion and anxiety. This persistent confusion gives rise to various ailments: a strong tongue yet foggy in perception, prone to worry and sadness, lacking vitality—these are signs of mental illness. The \"Nanjing\" states: \"Nourishing the heart benefits its glory.\" Thus, one should primarily replenish true blood. When true blood is abundant, the heart has support, and there is no ailment that cannot be cured. There are also instances of catching wind, cold, heat, and humidity, which block various meridians and lead to confusion; excessive intake of liquids can stagnate the stomach, also causing confusion. One must treat according to the symptoms presented. As for forgetfulness, it often involves a tendency for joyful oblivion. The spleen governs intention and thoughts, while the heart also rules thinking. When thought is excessive, intentions become unclear, and the spirit's palace is not functionally active, leading to forgetfulness. The method for harmonizing this is to regulate both heart and spleen, ensuring tranquility of the spirit, thereby restoring awareness. Causes of Shock Illness Shock arises when the heart suddenly stirs and becomes unsettled. Fire is associated with movement, thus the heart fire becomes intensely hot. Nevertheless, this is merely extreme heat within; when fire reaches its peak, it resembles water, causing surprise. Conversely, when kidney water is undermined by fear, excess leads to harm; this is a matter of balance. The saying \"fear leads to surprise\" indicates that fear damages the kidneys and depletes water, thereby intensifying heart fire and resulting in surprise. A combination of yin and yang leading to fright results in back pain and sighing, referred to as Wind Disturbance. The stomach and spleen correspond to earth, while the liver corresponds to wood—wood overcomes earth.

Palpitations occur when the heart is weak. When one feels anxious and cannot find peace, this defines palpitations. The causes of heart palpitations fall into two categories: one is qi deficiency, and the other is stagnant fluid. In cases of cold damage lasting two or three days, if the person experiences palpitations accompanied by restlessness, the prescription is Xiao Jian Zhong Tang. If someone with a Shaoyin condition has severe palpitations, add five grams of cinnamon to Si Ni San. This indicates palpitations due to qi deficiency. If one drinks too much water, it will inevitably lead to palpitations below the heart, indicating palpitations due to stagnant fluid. The qi deficiency occurs because of weak yang energy within, leaving the heart below empty, causing internal movement of the righteous qi, which leads to palpitations. Stagnant fluid results from water accumulating below the heart; since the heart is fire and dislikes water, when water is stationary within, the heart's inability to find peace causes palpitations. Furthermore, after sweating or purging, if the righteous qi is internally weak and the evil qi strikes against it, this can also cause palpitations. In cases of yangming disease, if excessive sweating occurs, the individual may experience palpitations with a pressed heart and the hands crossed over the chest.

These symptoms arise from the lingering邪 (evil) after sweating, and those with qi deficiency and palpitations are distinct. Some conditions require stabilization, others require dispersion, all must be assessed to see if the qi is floating. Additionally, excessive drinking causes water to accumulate, which can lead to palpitations. The \"Essentials from the Golden Cabinet\" states that when one eats little but drinks excessively, water can accumulate in the heart and lead to severe palpitations. Drinking causes palpitations more than other evils; even if other evils are present, one must first treat the palpitations. Why? Because when water accumulates in the heart, if the water vapor disperses, it can affect various organs: in the lungs, it leads to wheezing and coughing; in the stomach, it causes belching and choking; on the skin, it causes swelling; in the intestines, it leads to diarrhea. This cannot be treated lightly. The classics say: when there are palpitations under the heart with a cold sensation, one should first treat the water condition, using Poria and Licorice Decoction, and then treat the cold sensation.

For fright, one uses a formula to expel phlegm and settle fright; for palpitations, a formula to expel water and dissolve fluids should be used. What is called supporting the vacuity merely involves nourishing the heart's blood and harmonizing the heart's qi. Forgetfulness often arises from a deficiency of spirit, and in some cases, also from phlegm.

Agitation, in essence, arises from a lack of calmness within the heart. Surprise, on the other hand, is caused by an external stimulus. Zhang Zihe said: Surprise results from ignorance of oneself; fear arises from self-awareness. Indeed, surprise occurs when one hears a sound causing alarm, while fear comes from self-awareness, as in the case when one feels they might be caught and cannot sit or lie down alone without needing a companion to feel secure. Some might even need a light at night; if no candle or lamp is available, they feel fear. The \"Inner Classic\" does not mention surprise and fear, as it begins from the \"Golden Coffer Prescriptions,\" which states: \"There is surprise followed by fear\"; it adds that surprise and fear become apparent. Surprise and fear refer to the same concept of alarm and dread, and fear also implies apprehension, thus sharing a similar meaning. Generally, when both names are mentioned together as a framework, it pertains to the interplay of yin and yang. For instance, when joy and anger are mentioned together, joy emanates from the heart (yang), while anger arises from the liver (yin). When will and intention are discussed together, will is static and unchanging (yin), while intention is dynamic and unstable (yang). Static indicates yin, while dynamic indicates yang."},{"anchor":"trans-31p","marker":"31p","type":"translation","text":"Fear and shock arise when external events disturb the inner mind. When the heart is moved, the spirit becomes unsettled; when there is confusion from outside, it frustrates one's aspirations, leading to a retreat of one's essence. Thus, in the Inner Canon it is said: when shocked, the heart has nowhere to rely on, the spirit has nowhere to return, and thoughts cannot settle, causing the qi to be disrupted. In fear, the essence retreats, leading to the closure of the upper burner; when closed, there is no qi returning; without qi returning, the lower burner becomes swollen, causing the qi to stagnate. It is also said: experiencing wealth after poverty or distress after happiness, sorrow and worry being internally bound, may lead to the loss of essence and a deep-rooted illness with insufficient qi, resulting in a sudden shock. Such cases are all illnesses that arise from external events disturbing the inner heart and spirit. As for the internal balance of yin and yang affecting shock and fear, shock is caused by fire and heat agitating the heart; when the heart is disturbed, the spirit becomes chaotic, and the spirit’s use lacks direction. Thus, the manifestations of shock vary and depend on the individual, corresponding with the five spirits. The liver houses the hun (ethereal soul); when the hun is unsettled, it causes alarm and delusion. The lung houses the po (corporal soul); when the po is restless, it leads to agitation. The spleen houses the yi (intellect); when the yi is not focused, it causes confusion. The kidney houses will; when the will is frustrated, it leads to fear and trepidation. Although the stomach has no spirit, it is considered the sea of the five organs; when numerous heat energies return to it, it results in shock and mania. For instance, upon hearing the sound of wood, the heart may tremble and yearn to move. Fear, then, arises as heat injures the kidneys; when the kidneys are harmed, the essence becomes deficient; when the essence is deficient, there is insufficient will. Since the will is originally steady and unchanging, fear does not exhibit other forms."},{"anchor":"trans-32p","marker":"32p","type":"translation","text":"In the \"Inner Canon,\" regarding the disease caused by shock, there are two types of heat and fire. The qi of the celestial controller is related to the reaction of the springs, which leads to various heat-related illnesses in different channels, as well as the accumulation of the three yang and the qi combining with the yang, all of which contribute to shock and similar ailments. Therefore, in a general sense, it is said that all diseases of shock derive from fire. For the fear-induced illness, it arises from the essence and qi combining in the kidneys, leading to fear. A deficiency in blood can also cause fear. If there is a deficiency in yin, the yang will intrude upon it, causing them to clash, resulting in fear. Furthermore, if the stomach qi is hot and the kidney qi is weak, fear can occur, regardless of whether the kidneys are compromised. However, when the liver is involved, the shock and fear may interact, as the liver’s qi belongs to the yang while residing in the yin, storing blood and the soul. If the soul is unsettled, the spirit becomes agitated; when the spirit is agitated, shock occurs. A deficiency in blood leads to discontent, and discontent leads to fear. Hence, both conditions are attributed to the liver. Similar situations arise from the two types of heat, attributed to external pathogenic influences. Other forms of shock and fear arise from the internal fluctuations of a person's qi in relation to yin and yang. However, it is not solely about the two forms of heat. When there is a rapid pulse in the yangming channel, this too can induce shock. It is queried whether the diseases of shock and fear, arising from internal and external causes, have the same or different treatment methods. It is stated that for shock, one should pacify the spirit; for fear, one should stabilize the will. Treatment should distinguish between yin and yang, hence they cannot be treated alike. The changes in the I Ching depict the interaction of the heavens and the earth, with the hexagrams of Kan and Li arranged, leading to their interplay resulting in a completed state, corresponding to the five organs of the human body."},{"anchor":"trans-33p","marker":"33p","type":"translation","text":"The heart represents the fire of separation, with inward yin and outward yang; the kidney represents the water of the abyss, with inward yang and outward yin. The internal is the master, and the external is the application. The internal masters are the five spirits, while the external applications are the five energies. Therefore, the heart governs with the spirit as the master and uses yang; the kidney governs with will as the master and uses yin. Yang corresponds to qi and fire; yin corresponds to essence and water. When water and fire are harmonized, it all relies on nourishing the spirit with yin essence, while storing yang qi below to stabilize the will. Otherwise, the spirit will be restless internally, yang qi will disperse externally, the will will be disturbed internally, and yin essence will flee below, and with the distinction between the two organ's water and fire, how can the treatment not differ in some way? Thus, for those who are startled, one must first calm their spirit; only then can the scattered qi be gathered. When qi is gathered, the yang pathway can function. For those who are fearful, one must first stabilize their will; only then can the fleeing essence be secured. When essence is secured, the yin qi can function. Regarding medicine, the two organs have distinct roles as sovereign, minister, and assistants in their usage, and the effects felt from the internal and external are not so different. For those startled by external matters, although Ziheshi mentions that the startled should be made calm, which is common practice, allowing the patient to hear and become accustomed to it so that they are naturally unstartled is indeed a good method. However, it is better to bring peace to the heart and ease the qi beforehand, and then use medicine.

Therefore, palpitation is synonymous with fright and agitation. However, modern interpretations divide this into two categories, which is incorrect. The causes of heart palpitations fall into two types: one is deficiency, and the other is excess intake. In cases of qi deficiency, it arises from the internal weakness of yang qi, resulting in an empty heart space where the internal heat causes palpitations. The same applies to blood deficiency. Cases of fluid retention occur when water stagnates below the heart, where the heart, being related to fire, repels water. When water is stagnant, the heart cannot find peace, resulting in palpitations. After sweating, vomiting, or purging, if the vital energy is internally deficient, palpitations may occur; if there is an invasion of pathogenic energy, palpitations may also arise; and if there is a depletion of the nourishing and defending energies leading to pulse irregularities, the condition worsens. It is essential to generate bodily fluids and nourish blood to alleviate deficiency, especially when discussing febrile diseases. Regarding mixed diseases, one may refer to the \"Inner Canon,\" which states that in heart obstruction, there is a lack of pulse circulation, leading to discomfort in the chest. In cases of gallbladder disease, symptoms include bitter taste in the mouth, vomiting of residual bile, and a feeling of fear and anxiety as if one is about to be captured. The yangming channel is associated with movement; upon hearing wood sounds, one may feel startled; the pericardium is also linked to movement, with symptoms manifesting as great agitation in the heart; the kidneys relate to movement as well, presenting with heightened feelings of fear, resembling the sensation of impending capture."},{"anchor":"trans-35p","marker":"35p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Yuan Bing Shi\" states: When water diminishes and fire rises, the heart and chest become agitated, which is termed \"zhengchong\" (anxiety). Then it is understood that palpitations are a sickness, stemming from the heart's energy being out of balance, with movements creating fire pathogens. The heart is the lord fire, and the pericardium is the minister fire. Fire is yang, and yang is active. Below the lord fire, the yin essence supports it; below the minister fire, the water qi supports it. When these energies move correctly, they maintain purity and brightness, vital for life. If there is a lack of support, the lord fire becomes excessive and unbalanced, turning into restlessness and heat, while the minister fire moves erratically, bringing about both heat and motion. Is it not evident that this leads to symptoms of palpitations? Moreover, the heart is where the spirit resides. The classics say that the interaction of the two essences is termed spirit, and also state that blood and qi are the spirit of a person, indicating that yin and yang, qi and blood, are never separate from the heart. If one loses the yin, tilting towards yang, the yang becomes disorganized and scattered due to the loss of its support, thus the spirit becomes unsettled and anxious. In such cases, one should replenish the deficient heart blood from within the heart to soothe the spirit; if this fails, one should seek to weaken the excess while reinforcing the water element to restrain the yang energy. Furthermore, the fire of the pericardium not only aids the heart but also circulates in the five organs; hence, any erratic movement of qi in the organs is also due to fire. Therefore, when each organ is ill, they can all act in concert with the fire of the pericardium, causing palpitations."},{"anchor":"trans-36p","marker":"36p","type":"translation","text":"In such cases, one should identify the source of the heat arising from each organ, and thereafter adjust and balance the protective layer according to what is beneficial for treatment. If the heat from various organs moves to the heart and causes the fire of the protective layer to ignite, the treatment should also follow this principle. If the heart's qi is insufficient, and the kidney's water surges upward to stagnate in the heart, it is necessary to overcome the counteracting qi, drain excess water, and nourish the yang. If the true water of the left kidney is insufficient, and the fire of the right kidney rises and interacts with the protective layer, one must vigorously replenish the yin of the left kidney to counteract it. If internal and external evils stifle the two fires, preventing them from surging forth and blocking the nourishment of the correct qi, treatment should primarily focus on dispelling the evils and resolving the stagnation. If phlegm and fluid stagnate in the middle-jiao, obstructing the meridians and preventing smooth flow, and if the stifled fire collides with phlegm beneath the heart, causing palpitations, one must clear the phlegm, and once the meridians are flowing, the illness will resolve. Human temperament is inherently different; when one obtains clear qi, the heart’s perception is bright, while when one acquires turbid qi, the heart’s perception becomes dull. The clarity of the heart has no limits; even matters from a thousand or a hundred generations past, once seen, will be remembered for a lifetime and not forgotten—how could one forget what is currently at hand? Conversely, the dullness of the heart results in limited spirit; thus, in the face of current matters, one cannot recall past events."},{"anchor":"trans-37p","marker":"37p","type":"translation","text":"Liu Hejian stated that water is clear and bright while fire is dark and turbid, hence the highest virtue resembles water, while the lowest folly resembles fire; this is due to inherent qualities. If one's disposition is muddled, they cannot endure the disturbances of the world, and when disturbed, they lose their spirit and become forgetful. Indeed, qi and blood are the essence of a person. The classics say: \"In tranquility, the spirit is hidden; in agitation, it dissipates.\" Tranquility is the nature of water, while agitation is the function of fire. Therefore, when one's nature is tranquil, the heart remains centered; when emotions stir, the heart forgets the inside and becomes distracted by the outside. If agitation does not cease, forgetfulness also continues; if forgetfulness persists, the essence within becomes rare. If the essence within becomes rare, one often forgets the spoken words, even before a day has passed. Thus, many in the world forget because they are preoccupied, disturbed, and entangled in the affairs of life; their qi and blood become depleted, particularly if one's inherent qualities are above the average, and they maintain clarity that is not disturbed by external affairs, such a person is exceedingly rare. From this, it can be inferred that while medicine certainly has the function of calming the heart and nourishing the blood, it is less effective than achieving peace of mind, easing one's qi, and nurturing one's inner self. On the other hand, forgetfulness linked to phlegm is a temporary ailment; however, the causes of forgetfulness are not solely phlegm. Anything that the heart is attached to, combined with the heat of various fires that disrupts the heart, can lead to forgetfulness. As stated in the \"Lingshu,\" great anger harms the will, and the will suffers from forgetfulness. The \"Neijing\" says: \"Blood gathers below while qi gathers above; when in chaos, forgetfulness ensues.\" In this case, how can one not address each cause separately for treatment?"},{"anchor":"trans-38p","marker":"38p","type":"translation","text":"**On Proof** The ailment of frightful palpitations is characterized by a trembling heart and chest, a continual state of alarm and fear, leaving one unable to find peace at any time. However, in ancient times, there was no such name for this condition. In the \"Inner Canon,\" it describes a major channel of the stomach called \"Xu Li,\" located beneath the left breast, whose movement corresponds to clothing and represents a leakage of vital energy. In the texts of the Yue people and Zhongjing, there is a differentiation of moving energies in the upper and lower regions, stating that all such energies should not be sweated out. All these conditions are indeed types of frightful palpitations. This symptom is only found in those who suffer from Yin deficiency and overexertion. When Yin is deficient below, the vital energy has no root, and so it does not return to its source; thus, it floats and shakes in the chest above and vibrates beside the navel below. Those with mild deficiency will experience minor movements, while those with severe deficiency will experience intense movements. Those afflicted should promptly regulate desires and labor, and strictly abstain from alcohol and sensual pleasures. In treatment, one should promptly nurture energy and essence and reinforce the foundation. If one mistakenly believes this to be phlegm-fire and mistakenly implements purging treatments, it will hasten their danger. There are two types of fright: one that arises from illness and one that arises from fright leading to illness.

This distress must arise from the loss of qi through sights and sounds. Thus, it is advisable to nurture the heart and spirit, and bolster the liver and gallbladder, focusing primarily on restoring the original qi. In treating this, there is a distinction to be made; generally, those with strong qi are not easily startled, while those easily startled typically have insufficient liver and gallbladder strength. Therefore, even in the presence of external pathogens, one must understand the importance of addressing the root cause before the symptoms. Moreover, when startled, the qi becomes chaotic; when fearful, the qi descends. Although fright and fear seem similar, the harm from fear is particularly severe compared to that from shock. Why? Because fright occurs suddenly and can be quickly resolved; fear accumulates gradually and cannot easily be dispelled. It can even lead to timidity and damage the spirit, causing an erosion of essence, which diminishes day by day, without cessation until death ensues.

However, it is vital to cleanse the heart and settle the thoughts to fully dispel the root of the illness, in order to ensure preservation of health."},{"anchor":"trans-42p","marker":"42p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Treatment Methods** Anxiety is not a disease of the heart; rather, it is due to the deficiency of liver blood that cannot nourish the heart. The prescription includes five cents each of white peony, angelica, ophiopogon, and cooked rehmannia, one tael of sour jujube seed, three cents of poria, one cent each of north cornelian cherry and distant will, and two cents of ginseng, to be boiled in water and taken as a decoction. The brilliance of this formula lies in not specifically treating the heart; treating the liver is precisely how to treat the heart, and treating the lung benefits the heart. The kidney is the water organ; the heart is the fire organ. These two meridians, the heart and kidney, seem to be adversaries and ought not to be treated together. However, although the heart and kidney oppose each other, they actually rely on one another. Without the heart's fire, it becomes dead ash; without the kidney's water, it turns into ice and charcoal. The heart must receive kidney water to be nourished, and the kidney must have heart fire to be warmed. When a person is anxious and restless, isn’t it due to the heart and kidney not connecting? While others might consider anxiety and unrest as a heart issue, I view it as a kidney issue—not a reversal of logic, but rather a principle that is truly not easily overlooked."},{"anchor":"trans-43p","marker":"43p","type":"translation","text":"The recipe uses five taels each of white atractylodes, lotus seed, tangerine peel, and cooked rehmannia; three taels each of ginseng, jujube seed, fried yam, prepared bai zi ren (biota seed), poria, dogwood, and ophiopogon; one tael each of northern five-flavor fruit, polygala, and calamus; and three qian of cardamom. Grind all into powder and make into pills with honey, to be taken with five qian of boiling water. The effectiveness of this pill lies in its treatment for the kidneys, less so for the heart. When the heart is tranquil, the kidney energy remains stable; when the kidney energy is stable, the heart is not disturbed. Thus, treating the heart is indeed a means of treating the kidneys, and treating the kidneys is likewise a way to treat the heart. For heart-related ailments, such as distress and insomnia, this is due to a deficiency of heart blood. The recipe uses three qian each of ginseng, ophiopogon, poria, and angelica, two qian of red sage, and five qian each of raw and cooked jujube seeds, along with one qian each of calamus, licorice, and schisandra fruit, simmered in water for consumption. The effectiveness of this recipe lies in using five qian each of raw and cooked jujube seeds while employing nourishing heart herbs as adjuncts. The jujube seed is a supreme remedy for calming the heart and treating insomnia; the raw seed keeps one from sleeping during the day, while the cooked seed allows for peaceful nights without waking."},{"anchor":"trans-44p","marker":"44p","type":"translation","text":"When day and night are at peace, then the state of anxiety settles naturally, so why resort to remedies like tiger's eye, amber, or cinnabar? The symptoms of anxiety involve disturbance and restlessness, leading to a scattered mind and continuous palpitations, which are due to deficiency of the liver and kidneys and weakness of the heart's qi. If one resorts to phlegm treatment, it often leads to severe consequences. This is because kidney deficiency prevents the heart's qi from harmonizing, and heart deficiency further depletes the liver's qi. If one treats the phlegm instead of addressing the deficiency, how could death be avoided? There is a formula called Tranquility Decoction, which includes five qian each of jujube seeds, ophiopogon, and white atractylodes, as well as one liang each of ginseng, white peony, cooked rehmannia, and bog bean, plus three qian of white mustard seed, all to be decocted and taken. This formula serves as a tonic for the heart, liver, and kidneys, harmonizing the three channels, allowing the yin and yang qi to interact, thereby settling the anxiety and completely alleviating the symptoms of palpitations and confusion. Improper treatment of anxiety can lead to severe dangers. This condition often arises from seminal leakage accompanied by emotional distress, especially if one is careless about matters of attraction. It seems sensible to treat the kidneys primarily; however, why does strengthening the kidneys lead to increased anxiety? This happens because the liver becomes agitated, with its qi becoming overly vigorous; thus, supplementing the kidneys only causes the liver's qi to thrive further, which in turn exacerbates the heart's fire, leading to increased anxiety."},{"anchor":"trans-45p","marker":"45p","type":"translation","text":"However, can the heart not be replenished? If the heart is not replenished, the fire cannot be extinguished. By replenishing the heart and simultaneously using medications to clear the fire, one can achieve rejuvenation.

This formula is remarkable in not only calming the heart but also reducing fire; especially noteworthy is how it does not just descend liver fire but also nourishes the liver; even more remarkable is its capacity not to just replenish the kidney but also to nourish the lungs. The decrease of heart fire is exactly what calms the heart energy, and nourishing liver energy leads to a balanced liver, which in turn harmonizes the heart. Nourishing lung energy enables the lungs to thrive, thus controlling the exuberance of the liver meridian. When these methods are appropriately balanced, it naturally nourishes the heart energy, allowing for complete recovery from anxiety. Forgetfulness is a sign of illness.

When the left hand closes the passage of Yang (which means it relates to vitality), there is no gallbladder pulse, yielding knee pain, bitterness in the mouth, squinting eyes in fear as if seeing ghosts, experiencing many scares and little strength. Needling the foot's Jue Yin point (which is associated with the liver) treats the Yin; this is done between the big toe or at the middle of the three hair folicles (in the foot). \"The Comprehensive Guide to Medicine\" states: when the heart is flickering and beating rapidly, reducing the flow, moxibustion works effectively. For forgetfulness, use the points of the Hidden Gaps, Heart Shu, Spirit Gate, Central Pass, and Three Miles, and moxibustion on the Lesser Sea. Case Study \"The Fundamental Prescriptions\" states: In the year of the Gui Chou of Shaoxing, I was in the city of Siming, where a man named Dong suffered from unsettled spirit energy. Each time he lay down, his soul would soar, sensing his body in bed but his spirit detached. He experienced fright and many nightmares, unable to sleep throughout the night. Other doctors were ineffective, so I proceeded to diagnose him. I asked: \"What kind of illness did the doctors treat?\" Dong replied, \"Everyone thinks it’s a heart illness.\" I said: \"From the pulse, the liver channel is afflicted, so it is not a heart illness. The liver energy is attacked by deficient evil energy. The liver stores the soul; when the wandering spirit changes, the healthy person’s liver does not suffer from evil and allows the soul to return to the liver efficiently, thus achieving calmness and sleep. Now, with evil in the liver, the soul cannot return, so while lying down, it feels as though the soul is soaring outside the body.\" The liver governs anger, thus even a little anger feels severe. Dong joyfully said: \"I have never heard this explanation before. Although I have not taken any medicine, I already feel my chronic illness beginning to leave my body.\""},{"anchor":"trans-99p","marker":"99p","type":"translation","text":"I wish to seek treatment! I said: You should hold on to this statement and discuss it with other physicians regarding the method of treatment and then gradually inquire further. After ten days, you came back. You said that the physicians thoroughly discussed both ancient and modern formulas, but none corresponded to the illness. Therefore, I prescribed the Pearl Mother Pill and the Du Huo Decoction for you, and after a month, the illness was completely cured. This treatment uses Pearl Mother as the chief ingredient and Dragon's Tooth as an assistant. Pearl Mother primarily belongs to the liver channel, and Dragon's Tooth is similarly related to the liver. Dragon's Tooth and Tiger's Eye are often regarded by modern people as heart-calming medicines, yet they do not realize that Dragon's Tooth soothes the soul, while Tiger's Eye stabilizes the spirit, each referring to its nature. The eastern Azure Dragon represents wood, belonging to the liver, where the soul is housed. The western White Tiger represents metal, belonging to the lungs, where the spirit is housed. The dragon is capable of transformation, thus the soul wanders and remains undetermined; the tiger maintains composure, allowing the spirit to rest and be guarded. I believe to treat an unsettled spirit, one should use Tiger's Eye; to treat a wandering soul, one should use Dragon's Tooth. All things have a natural order which does not change, but it relies on individuals to comprehend it."},{"anchor":"trans-100p","marker":"100p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Ruzhong Shiqin\" states: Wei Dexin’s wife was staying overnight on a second floor while traveling, when thieves attacked and set fire to the place, causing her to fall from the bed in fright. From then on, whenever she heard a sound, she would be startled and unaware of people around her, and her family members would walk on tiptoe, daring not to make a sound. For over a year, she did not recover, and various doctors diagnosed her condition as a heart illness, treating her with ginseng, pearls, and calming pills, all without effect. A healer observed her condition and concluded: \"Fright comes from outside; it is yang. Fear arises from within; it is yin. Fright is due to a lack of self-awareness, while fear comes from self-awareness. The gallbladder, belonging to the liver’s wood element, represents courage. If someone is frightened, it harms the gallbladder.\" He then instructed two maids to hold her hands and positioned a small table in front of her on a high chair. The healer said, \"Madam, you should look at this.\" He struck a piece of wood against the table, causing her to be greatly startled. The healer remarked, \"I struck the table with a piece of wood; why are you startled?\" After a moment of calm, he struck again, and her fright lessened. Again, he struck three to five more times, hit the door with a staff, and quietly sent someone to knock on the window behind a painting, gradually helping her calm down and laugh, saying, \"What is this treatment method?\" The healer replied: \"The Inner Canon states: ‘Fright should be settled; settlement leads to normalcy.’ When one regularly encounters such things, there will be no fright.\" That night, he had someone knock on her doors and windows from dusk until dawn. For the frightened person, the spirit is elevated. By striking the table from below, she looks down, thus retrieving her spirit. After just a day or two, even if she heard thunder, she would not be frightened.

Due to a tax debt in autumn, he was hit with the official staff sixty times, which left him in shock and gave him a wind issue that had lasted for three years. When the illness intensified, his hands and feet trembled uncontrollably, rendering him unable to hold objects. He required someone to feed him, his mouth and eyes became dull, and his lips and tongue were in a sorry state. His trembling was like a marionette being pulled by strings, and whenever he had an episode, people in the market would gather to watch. At night, he experienced fever, discarding his clothes and bedding, with his whole body itching. He felt hot inside but cold outside, and for a long time wanted to end his life but couldn't even manage that. He sought medical help to the point of exhausting his family, yet his illness worsened. The old man's son, a minor official in the town, informed a healer about his father's condition. The healer said that this illness was quite easy to treat. If it were still the peak of summer, a single eruption would suffice to cure him. Now that it was autumn and cooler, he suggested that three eruptions might be needed. If he did not get better, the healer could further stimulate acupuncture points to ensure recovery. They first used a sweat-inducing powder to promote perspiration, then administered an eruptive remedy that caused him to expel one or two liters of phlegm. By evening, he would also experience five to seven bowel movements, which slightly improved his condition. After five days, another eruption expelled three to four liters of phlegm, resembling clumps of egg yolk and appearing as hot as soup. The old man, unable to observe this himself due to his shaking hands, had his wife check. His throat was swollen and painful, leaving him dazed like a drunk. After about an hour or two, he gradually regained some consciousness and had several more bowel movements. He immediately felt lighter, his trembling reduced, the fever subsided, and he could walk again. His hands regained the ability to hold a comb and a spoon. Before three eruptions occurred, his illness vanished as if washed away. After recovering, he only felt extreme cold. The healer advised him to nourish himself with food, which would gradually help him recover. Indeed, after a major illness passes, the protective qi is not fully restored, so it is advisable to use medicines that dispel wind and guide qi. It is crucial not to use hot remedies to warm him, as that could lead to other ailments."},{"anchor":"trans-102p","marker":"102p","type":"translation","text":"A man, twenty-eight years old, sought treatment. He was weak, with limp limbs and a pale complexion. He felt pain in the left side of his body, radiating like an arm, with pain occurring at all times. His appetite was not diminished, his bowel movements were normal, and his urine was slightly yellow. This had persisted for two or three years. Various doctors had exhausted their methods and sought the help of a healer. Upon examination, it was found that the issue involved the foot Jueyin liver channel and was also related to the foot Shaoyang gallbladder channel. The healer stated: \"The liver corresponds to wood, and the gallbladder to fire; thus the green. The yellow represents the spleen.\" He diagnosed a weak gallbladder pulse, indicating a shock. Due to this shock, the gallbladder was afflicted, and there should be green phlegm in the abdomen. The patient mentioned that he had previously been in a military camp that caught fire, which marked the onset of his illness. The healer prepared one hundred fifty pills of Juanchuan powder, adding four to five qian of ginger juice, to be taken in the early morning. After ingestion, the patient expelled green phlegm four to five times. When asked about the large quantity of ginger, the healer replied: \"The spicy nature can cut through stagnation.\" After expelling phlegm, the patient felt slight pain and was instructed to expel once more, this time using a dosage reduced by one-third. He expelled green phlegm three to four times, after which the pain stopped, and he felt hungry and regained some strength.

He replied: How long have you been affected by this shock? The diviner reflected and said: When the fire struck, I was fast asleep in the cottage. I was startled awake by my family calling out, but I couldn't speak due to the shock; by then the fire had blocked the door, and my father pulled me out from the flames. It has been five years since then. Zhang said: Your courage is weakened by the great fright; the liver (gallbladder) is dominating the spleen (earth). This means the lesser yang fire is overpowering the spleen, and there is heat in the spleen, which destroys the grains you eat. Although the heat can transform the grains, the essence is not preserved, hence you will surely have no children. This causes the essence to fail and adversely affects the woman as well; therefore, your wife must have heat in her limbs, weakness in her extremities, and irregular menstrual flow. The diviner replied: My wife is indeed like this; it has also been five years. On another day, a disciple asked Zhang about the theory found in the \"Inner Canon\" regarding the relations of excess and deficiency in treatments. Zhang said: For instance, if wood affects the earth of the stomach, this earth cannot overcome the wood. The deficient energy seeks refuge in the child; the earth can generate metal (geng), which corresponds to the large intestine, while the spicy flavors represent metal; thus one uses a great quantity of ginger to overcome the wood. However, one must not first open the earth of the spleen, as it will not be able to function that way. Therefore, one first uses herbal pills to clear the blocked pathway, which treats what cannot be overcome first, and then ginger juice is used to enhance the laxative effect for subsequent treatment of what is overcome.

Upon examining his pulse, both hands exhibited a weak and string-like quality along with a heavy, rapid beat. I noted that the rapidity indicated heat, the weak and string-like quality pointed to severe shock, and the sour plum juice had stagnated in the middle burner. Therefore, to replenish the deficiency, clear the heat, and guide away the phlegm, the illness could be stabilized. I prescribed a concentrated decoction of ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, radish root, and lotus seeds, and added bamboo juice and ginger juice to it. After ten days without effect, the others speculated on the ineffectiveness of the medicine.
