<p>The Door of Vomiting</p>
<p>Huangdi&#39;s Plain Questions</p>
<p>Important Treatise on Diagnosis, Final Discussion<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The conclusion of the Greater Yin pertains to abdominal distension, leading to an inability to breathe. It is characterized by frequent sighing and vomiting; when vomiting occurs, it causes a counterflow, resulting in a red face. If there is no counterflow, there is blockage between the upper and lower regions, and without this connection, the face turns black, and the skin becomes parched, leading to death. </p>
<p><em>Explanation: The Foot Greater Yin channel enters the abdomen and is associated with the spleen, hence the abdominal distension. The Hand Greater Yin channel ascends to the diaphragm and is related to the lungs, which control breathing, thus resulting in the inability to breathe. With excessive fullness, rising and descending become difficult; without breath, the flow of qi is obstructed, leading to sighing and vomiting. Vomiting causes qi to counterflow upwards, resulting in a red face. Without counterflow, there is blockage in the middle, hence the upper and lower regions do not connect. When the spleen&#39;s qi fails, it cannot regulate fluids, causing the face to turn black. When the lung&#39;s qi fails, its functions do not operate properly, leading to dry skin and hair.</em></p>
<h3>On Pain</h3>
<p>Cold qi lodges in the intestines and stomach, causing counterflow upwards, thus resulting in pain and vomiting. </p>
<p><em>Explanation: Cold qi resides in the space between the intestines and stomach, and when it rises, it causes pain and vomiting.</em></p>
<h3>On Obstruction</h3>
<p>When there is obstruction of the lung, it manifests as distress, fullness, shortness of breath, and vomiting. </p>
<p><em>Explanation: The lungs govern qi and control respiration; their channel arises from the middle jiao and follows the stomach upwards to the diaphragm in relation to the lungs, thus when obstructed, it leads to distress, fullness, shortness of breath, and vomiting.</em> </p>
<p>When there is obstruction of the spleen, there is a feeling of weakness in the limbs, coughing with vomiting of fluids, and severe blockage upwards.</p>
<p><em>Explanation: When the stomach qi cannot circulate to the four limbs, they feel weak and droop. The spleen channel ascends to the diaphragm and connects to the throat, and when qi is obstructed, it leads to coughing. When ingested fluids reach the stomach but cannot be transformed by the spleen, it results in vomiting of fluids. When lung qi cannot flow properly, it leads to severe blockage upwards.</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Syncope</strong></p>
<p>When the Taiyin is in syncope, it leads to fullness and distension in the abdomen, difficulty in bowel movements, a lack of appetite, vomiting after eating, and inability to sleep. <strong>[Note: The channels of the foot Taiyin enter the abdomen and are associated with the spleen and stomach. Therefore, syncope leads to abdominal fullness and distension. When food and drink enter the stomach, the spleen is responsible for their transportation; if there is reversed qi in the spleen, bowel movements will be obstructed. If the spleen is unable to transport, the stomach will also be unbalanced, hence the vomiting after eating and inability to sleep.]</strong></p>
<p>When the Shaoyin is in reverse syncope, it presents as a feeling of emptiness and fullness, vomiting of transformation, and clear diarrhea; it is related to the main condition. <strong>[Note: The qi of the Shaoyin combines with the Yangming and is responsible for processing food and water. When the Shaoyin qi is in syncope, it leads to the central region being filled with emptiness, resulting in vomiting and, due to the failure of the interaction between the upward and downward fire and water, clear diarrhea occurs. &quot;Vomiting of transformation&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;transformed vomiting.&quot;]</strong></p>
<p>When the hand Taiyin is in reverse syncope, it results in fullness, cough, and excessive foamy vomiting; it is related to the main condition. <strong>[Note: Reverse syncope of the hand Taiyin indicates reversed lung qi. The lungs govern qi, resulting in fullness and cough. The inability to transport water and fluids leads to excessive foamy vomiting. This concerns diseases originating from the lung, hence the treatment should focus on the lung qi.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyin condition referred to as vomiting after eating is due to an excess of substances overflowing upward, which causes vomiting. [Note: In November, when all the energies of living things are stored within, it overflows upward, hence the vomiting. The text states: The foot Taiyin uniquely receives its turbid energy; when the clear energy of Taiyin rises, it results in belching, while the overflow of turbid energy leads to vomiting.]</p>
<p>The Shaoyin condition referred to as vomiting, coughing, and wheezing occurs because the Yin energy is below and the Yang energy is above; the Yang energies rise without support, thus causing vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. [Note: The cold water of Shaoyin is below, while the heat of fire is above; if water and fire do not interact, the Yang energies rise without support. Therefore, the heat of Yang rises abnormally, leading to the illnesses of vomiting, coughing, and wheezing.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Discourse on the Acupuncture Ban</strong></p>
<p>To pierce the gallbladder: one day and a half in death&#39;s grasp, resulting in vomiting.<br><em>Note: When bile leaks, it causes bitter vomit; if there is vomiting, the gallbladder&#39;s energy is extinguished. All eleven organs depend on the gallbladder, for it is the origin of the vital energies of the yin and yang of the organs. Thus, a strike to the gallbladder results in one day and a half of near death.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discourse on the Five Constant Governances</strong></p>
<p>The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; heat descends, lung qi ascends, leading to wheezing and vomiting.<br><em>Note: Fiery heat consumes the lungs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discourse on the Six Basic Principles</strong></p>
<p>The Greater Yang governs the heavens; the qi transforms and runs according to the primordial state. The initial qi shifts, the earth qi transitions, thus the qi is greatly warm, causing body heat, headaches, and vomiting.<br><em>Note: The earth qi transitioning refers to the concluding qi of the previous year merging with the initial qi of this year. The concluding qi of the previous year is the fire of the Lesser Yin, while the initial qi of this year is the fire of the Lesser Yang, the interplay of these two fires results in greatly warm qi, leading to body heat, headaches, and vomiting.</em><br>The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; the qi transforms and runs according to the postnatal state. The initial qi results in sneezing and a feeling of nausea.<br><em>Note: Sneezing and nausea pertain to the qi of wind and wood.</em><br>The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; the qi transforms and runs according to the primordial state; the second qi causes heat to become stifled above, resulting in coughing and vomiting.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The second type of qi corresponds to the damp earth of the moon, leading to illness from heat causing vomiting, representing internal heat accumulation. The third type of qi, when the heavenly governance is distributed and scorching heat arrives, affects the lesser yang, causing the people to suffer from coughs and vomiting. The qi from the heavens descends upon the three types, hence the governance of heaven is dispersed. The qi of the royal season also belongs to the lesser yang, explaining the arrival of scorching heat. The people experience coughs and vomiting due to the influence of wind and fire qi.</p>
<p>When the earth qi becomes stagnant, severe cases maylead to heart pain and lateral discomfort, as well as vomiting and chaotic symptoms. </p>
<p>Regarding the people&#39;s heart pain and other associated symptoms, these arise from the influence of the earth qi. The qi of the five movements resides within, receiving the dominance of heavenly governance above, while being restrained by subterranean forces below. There is no distinction between excess and deficiency; rather, all are affected by stagnation which subsequently manifests. Thus, what emerges is essentially the original qi from which the stagnation arises, rather than a situation where the child becomes the mother.</p>
<p>When fire qi becomes stagnant, the people suffer from nausea and reversal of qi.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>In the case of the people experiencing vomiting and reversals, it is due to excessive heat. </p>
<p>When the lesser yang is involved, it leads to sneezing and vomiting.<br>(Note: This is a common occurrence in spring.)</p>
<p>When the lesser yang is involved, it leads to vomiting and regurgitation.<br>(Note: This is a common occurrence in autumn.)</p>
<p>The True Classic Discussion of Essentials</p>
<p>In a year of the jueyin aspect, with the wind dominating, the people suffer from inability to eat and drink, a blocked throat, vomiting after eating, abdominal distension, and excessive belching. When they then take in air, they feel relieved as if rejuvenated, but their bodies feel heavy.<br>(Note: The jueyin aspect occurs in the year of yin and shen. Spleen-related illnesses lead to symptoms of inability to eat and vomiting; this is due to wood-dominating soil.)</p>
<p>In a year of the yangming aspect, with dryness dominating, the people suffer from a preference for vomiting, yielding bitter vomit.<br>(Note: The yangming aspect occurs in the year of zi and wu. A preference for vomiting with bitterness indicates an issue concerning the foot lesser yang.)</p>
<p>The jueyin aspect reigns over the heavens, with the wind dominating, leading to the people experiencing vomiting when they eat.<br>(Note: The jueyin aspect reigning over the heavens occurs in the year of si and hai. Vomiting after eating indicates a spleen meridian issue.)</p>
<p>In the case of the lesser yin aspect reigns over the heavens, with heat dominating, the people suffer from sneezing and vomiting.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The victory of the Jueyin leads to a feeling of nausea, and in severe cases, vomiting occurs with a blockage in the throat. The essence of feeling nauseous indicates a stomach disorder. When the Shaoyin prevails and the heat of summer arrives, there is vomiting and a sense of reversal. This reversal is due to the upward agitation of Yin energy.</p>
<p>The prominence of the Shaoyang indicates that heat invades the stomach, prompting a desire to vomit, which is often acidic and accompanied by hunger. The energy of Shaoyang connects to the Sanjiao, hence the richness of heat in the stomach results in nausea and hunger; the source of the Sanjiao emanates from the stomach region.</p>
<p>The recurrence of Jueyin involves vomiting where food cannot be ingested; it enters but quickly exits, and in severe cases affects the spleen, causing food stagnation and subsequent vomiting. The term &quot;recurrence&quot; refers to the clash of the three Yin and three Yang energies, where the prevailing energy obstructs, leading to a resurgence of symptoms. Vomiting and inability to retain food suggest that Wood excess disrupts Earth.</p>
<p>The recurrence of Taiyin manifests through increased dampness, impeding the digestion of food, resulting in silent vomiting of clear liquid; in severe cases, it affects the kidneys, leading to unrestrained discharge. The transformation occurs when energy becomes extreme; thus, the abundance of Yin dampness inhibits digestion. Vomiting occurs as dampness overpowers Yangming. The notion of silence refers to a reclusive state, where Yin and Yang are at odds. Taiyin encompasses the three Yin energies.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>When yin transforms and overcomes yang, yang becomes exhausted while yin flourishes, thus producing the expectoration of clear fluids. In severe cases, it enters the kidneys, descending to combine with the cold water of winter. The kidneys open at the two yin, which is why it is called the &quot;orifice discharge.&quot; </p>
<p>In the recovery of Shao Yang, the fire energy rises internally, manifesting as oral ulcers and vomiting, with blood overflowing and leaking. The internal fire rising refers to the emergence of yin fire from within. When it arises in the upper burner, it causes oral ulcers; in the middle burner, it causes vomiting; and in the lower burner, it leads to blood overflow and leakage. </p>
<p>In the recovery of Yang Ming, the pure energy surges greatly, and in severe cases, there may be heart pain, fullness, abdominal distention, and diarrhea, along with bitter vomiting, cough, and irritability, indicating illness in the diaphragm. The resurgence of Yang Ming corresponds to the time when the original governing energy manifests, thus the great surge of pure energy. Heart pain, fullness, abdominal distention, and diarrhea are driven by fire and earth. Those with gallbladder issues often sigh and experience bitter vomiting, indicating that wood is suffering under the punishment of metal, as the bowels are also afflicted. Coughing and irritation signify illness in the diaphragm, with the energy of Yang Ming rebelling upwards. </p>
<p>In Shao Yang, when the heavenly energy is controlled, one experiences vomiting and reversal.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>【Note: Nausea arises from the combined influence of the Yin and the dampness of the earth within.】 When the Shaoyang is in the spring, it dominates; thus, when there is excess, the heat rises and afflicts the heart, leading to heart pain and heat, and resulting in nausea. The Shaoyin shares the same condition. 【Note: When there is excess, the heat rises and afflicts the heart. Heart pain and heat are caused by the counterflow of the guest energy of the two fires (the monarch and minister) affecting it. Nausea resulting from counterflow is due to the guest energy of the Taiyin causing internal distress. The term &#39;counterflow&#39; indicates that due to excess, the guest energy causes internal distress. When it says &#39;the Shaoyin shares the same condition,&#39; it refers to the fiery nature rising; therefore, both fires experience this counterflow and internal distress.】 All forms of weakness, wheezing, and vomiting pertain to the upper regions.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>All symptoms such as cough, vomiting, and others belong to the upper parts of the body, moving from the lower to the upper. When the fluids from below rise, they cause cough and vomiting, similar to the interplay of yin and yang in heaven and earth, with water following the rise and fall of qi.</p>
<p>All acidic vomiting and urgent pressure below belong to heat. Heat is the energy of the sovereign fire.</p>
<p>Concerning lung injuries, if the spleen qi is not maintained, the stomach qi is unclear, and the meridian qi does not function, the true organs will become damaged, and the collaterals will be obstructed, leading to either hemorrhage or vomiting. These two conditions are not similar.</p>
<p>The spleen qi fails to control and hence damages the earth, resulting in an inability to restrain water. The unclear stomach qi allows pathogenic water to enter the stomach. When the stomach qi is harmed, the meridian qi does not function properly. The true organs refer to the true essences of the spleen and kidneys. When there is damage, the earth is harmed and water is released uncontrollably. The stomach governs the meridians; when water enters the stomach, the collaterals become obstructed. The five organs, responsible for storing essence, are affected. When the earth element fails to maintain its function, the bodily fluids from the five organs leak out. When water is in the stomach, it causes vomiting; when in the lungs, it causes hemorrhage. This watery pathogen directly harms both the stomach and lungs.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Lingshu Scripture</strong></p>
<p><strong>Channels and Vessels Section</strong></p>
<p>The spleen&#39;s foot Taiyin channel, when in motion, causes strong sensations at the base of the tongue, nausea after eating, stomach pain, abdominal distension, and frequent belching. When it subsequently receives qi, there is a quickened feeling similar to exhaustion, and the whole body feels heavy.<br><strong>[Note: The motion causes a sickness that affects the channels, which in turn impacts the organs, leading to symptoms such as strong sensations at the tongue base, nausea after eating, stomach pain, and abdominal distension. Frequent belching indicates that the spleen qi ascends to the heart. The quickened feeling after receiving qi resembles exhaustion, as the condition of reversal spreads from above and below. The heaviness in the body indicates an inverse flow of Taiyin qi.]</strong><br>The liver&#39;s foot Jueyin channel is responsible for illnesses arising from the liver, manifesting as fullness in the chest and counterflow vomiting.<br><strong>[Note: It is specifically for illnesses arising from the liver that result in chest fullness and counterflow vomiting. When food and qi enter the stomach, essence is dispersed in the liver, moving qi through the channels. An illness arising from the liver leads to rebellious liver qi that cannot disperse the essence of food, hence the symptoms of chest fullness and counterflow vomiting.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fever and Heat Section</strong></p>
<p>In cases of heat illness, if sweating does not occur and there is vomiting of blood, death follows.<br><strong>[Note: Absence of sweating and vomiting of blood indicates that external heat has not been resolved and has entered the Yin channels. If the heat is severe and the vital qi is already exhausted, acupuncture would be of no benefit.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jade Plate Section</strong><a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Coughing, vomiting, abdominal distension, and diarrhea, with a pulse that has stopped, indicate a reversal of the qi. In such cases, death will occur within a short time. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Bitter flavors travel to the bones; excessive consumption leads to vomiting. Why is this?&quot; Shao Yu replied: &quot;Bitterness enters the stomach, overpowering the essence of the grains. When bitterness reaches the lower abdomen, the pathways of the three jiao are blocked, thus causing vomiting. Teeth are the endpoints of the bones; hence, bitterness travels to the bones, and once it enters, it may resurface, revealing its pathway to the bones.&quot; </p>
<p>Notes: Ren Gu An said: &quot;Bitterness that rises causes suffering; it is the sovereign taste, overpowering the essence of all grains. Bitterness has downward-moving properties, hence it enters the lower abdomen. The three jiao represent the lesser yang&#39;s fire. Bitterness has cold properties, thus blocking the pathways of the three jiao. When the three jiao are obstructed, the food and fluids in the stomach cannot be properly regulated, resulting in vomiting. The kidneys govern the bones, and as a cold-water organ, they connect with bitterness&#39;s cold nature, traveling to the bones in a related manner. However, bitterness is also a fire taste, which accounts for its movement downward and subsequent rise, due to its property of downward drainage combined with upward surging.&quot;<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</p>
<pre><code>        Pulse Diagnosis
</code></pre>
<p>If there is a pulse in the upper body and none in the lower, the person must vomit; failure to do so will result in death. If there is no pulse in the upper body but a pulse in the lower, although the person may feel fatigued, it does not pose a serious threat. This can be likened to a person holding a ruler and a tree having roots; even if the branches and leaves are withered, the roots will still nourish themselves. A pulse has its roots, and a person has their vital energy; thus, it is known they will not die. </p>
<p>For instance, if one obtains an indication of the heart pulse, the external symptoms may include a flushed face, dry mouth, and laughter; the internal symptoms show movement in the area above the navel, firm to the touch and painful; the illness is marked by anxiety of the heart, heart pain, heat in the palms, and restlessness. If these conditions are present, it indicates heart involvement; if not, it does not. </p>

<p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Cold air in the abdomen causes sharp pain, with fullness in the chest and flanks, leading to vomiting. For this condition, a decoction of aconite and polished rice is the remedy. </p>
<p>Severe cold pain in the chest and heart leads to an inability to eat or drink, with cold rising in the abdomen, causing swelling under the skin. If there is movement, one may see limbs above and below, pain making it unbearable to touch; Da Jian Zhong Tang is the remedy. </p>
<p>Cold in the liver manifests as an inability to raise the arms, a dry tongue base, a tendency to sigh, chest pain, difficulty turning over, and vomiting upon eating, often accompanied by sweating. </p>
<p>Phlegm above the diaphragm leads to fullness, wheezing, coughing, and vomiting. If there are alternating chills and fever, back pain, and tears from the eyes, the person may shake violently, indicating excessive drinking. </p>
<p>In cases of vomiting, thirst is generally noted; however, if one feels no thirst but experiences a sensation of excessive fluid under the heart, Xiaobanxia Tang is the remedy. </p>
<p>Sudden vomiting with a feeling of distention under the heart and water between the diaphragm, accompanied by dizziness or palpitations, can be addressed with Banxia Jia Fuling Tang. </p>
<p>If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel and vomits foam while feeling faint, it indicates water, to be treated with Wuling San. </p>
<p>Fluid accumulation below the heart leads to a sensation of fullness and consequently causes vomiting; treatment requires Banxia Fuling Tang. </p>
<p>If there is heat and discomfort in the heart leading to an urge to vomit, it is termed &quot;alcoholic jaundice.&quot; </p>
<p>Alcoholic jaundice may present with no fever, clarity of speech, fullness in the abdomen, and dry nasal passages. For a floating pulse, one should induce vomiting first; for a weak pulse, one should regulate downward. </p>
<p>For alcoholic jaundice characterized by heat in the heart and a desire to vomit, vomiting will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>For those who suffer from abdominal pain and nausea, Chaihu Decoction is appropriate (specifically, Xiao Chaihu Decoction). If someone has vomiting and pus or abscesses, they should not treat the vomiting; once the pus is resolved, they will recover naturally. </p>
<p>If nausea occurs before thirst, it is a sign of wanting relief. If thirst occurs before nausea, it indicates that fluids are stagnating in the heart area, categorized as fluid retention. When someone who typically feels thirsty suddenly has no thirst, it is due to the presence of stagnant fluids in the heart area, also categorized as fluid retention.</p>
<p>A question arises: if a patient has a rapid pulse, which indicates heat, one would expect to dispel food and encourage eating; why then do they vomit? The teacher replies: This is to induce sweating, allowing yang to slightly counteract, causing a deficiency in the qi. The rapid pulse indicates guest heat that cannot digest food, resulting from a cold and weakened stomach. A wiry pulse suggests deficiency. When stomach qi is exhausted, one might vomit the morning meal in the evening, leading to a condition called stomach reversal. If cold is present above, and the doctor attempts to treat it below, the pulse might end up being wiry, hence the term deficiency.</p>
<p>If the pulse at the inch position is weak and rapid, the weakness implies a lack of qi; without qi, the spirit is deficient; if the spirit is deficient, blood is insufficient; if blood is insufficient, the chest is cold. </p>
<p>If the pulse at the Fuyang position is floating and weak, it indicates deficiency, which points to spleen issues; if the spleen is injured, digestion will be impaired. Vomiting the morning meal in the evening, or the evening meal in the morning, with undigested food, is termed stomach reversal, and if the pulse is tight and weak, such a condition is difficult to treat. If a patient wishes to vomit, they should not be purged.</p>
<p>For those who are nauseous and have a feeling of fullness in the chest, the principal treatment is with Zhuyu Decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>For those who experience dry retching and headache, the Zhu Yu Decoction is indicated. For vomiting accompanied by rumbling in the intestines and a feeling of fullness beneath the heart, the Ban Xia Xie Xin Decoction is advised. If there is dry vomiting and diarrhea, the Huang Qin Jia Ban Xia Sheng Jiang Decoction should be used. For various types of vomiting where food cannot go down, the Xiao Ban Xia Decoction is appropriate. If the vomiting and the illness are located in the diaphragm, and there is a longing for water, this should be remedied promptly. The remedy for the longing for water is the Zhi Ling Powder. If there is vomiting with a weak pulse, frequent urination with diarrhea, slight fever, and signs of impending collapse, the Si Ni Decoction is indicated. For vomiting accompanied by fever, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is recommended. For vomit due to stomach reversal, the Da Ban Xia Decoction is suitable.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If food is eaten and immediately vomited, it should be treated with a mixture of rhubarb and licorice. For cases of stomach reversal, where there is vomiting and thirst with a desire to drink water, a blend of poria and lemna is indicated. If after vomiting there is a strong thirst for water and a craving to drink, the clam soup should be used. In cases of dry heaving and reverse vomiting, with the expulsion of saliva and foam, the mixture of pinellia and dried ginger is appropriate. When a patient feels a sensation of something like wheezing or vomiting without actually doing so, or a sense of unease in the chest, ginger and pinellia soup should be employed. For dry vomiting and discomfort in the hands and feet, the orange peel soup is indicated. For regurgitation, the orange peel and bamboo leaf mixture should be used.</p>
<p>Regarding the expulsion of roundworms:</p>
<p>If roundworm spasms occur, one should expel the worm while ensuring the patient is calm; if they become restless again later, it indicates cold in the organs, and the worm rises to the diaphragm, hence the restlessness, with intermittent vomiting after eating. If they are still restless and can smell food, they should expel the worm themselves. The illness caused by roundworms leads to salivation and heart pain, occurring intermittently; if the poison does not cease, a mixture of licorice powder and honey should be used.</p>
<p>On the study of organ disharmony:</p>
<p>When there is gurgling in the intestines, cold feet and hands, inability to keep food in the stomach, unremitting vomiting, emaciation of the skin and fur, wrinkling of the muscles, blockage in the ears and eyes, a fragmented voice, gasping during movement, and a lack of spirit, this indicates deficiency in the five organs. To diagnose the pulse, lift the fingers gently, press to feel delicately, and observe in which part the signs appear to determine the organ&#39;s condition. If the liver pulse is exceedingly slow, it leads to nausea and regurgitation.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If coughing from the liver persists, it may transmit evil energy into the gallbladder, leading to vomiting of clear fluids. When gallbladder ailments occur, one may experience a bitter taste in the mouth, deep sighing, vomiting of old food, a faint feeling in the heart, and fear of being captured, along with a sensation of something stuck in the throat, leading to frequent spitting. The pulse will be found floating and prominent at the left wrist, indicating this condition.</p>
<p>When heart qi is abundant, it can result in difficulty urinating, abdominal fullness, a feeling of heaviness, a warm sensation wanting to vomit but unable to do so, rapid breathing, and restlessness when lying down. The pulse at the left wrist and at the major pulse will be strong and pronounced in this case.</p>
<p>The spleen, associated with earth, when ill, will manifest in a withered yellow complexion. If excessive, the tongue may become rigid, there is lack of appetite, and episodes of nausea and vomiting occur, along with laxity in the limbs. Symptoms of spleen disease include a yellowish color, heaviness in the body, irregular bowel movements, a straight gaze, protruding lips, bluish nails, and severe vomiting of food, leading to pains in all joints that hinder movement. The pulse is expected to be large and soft but may actually be tight and rapid, indicating severe conditions that are nearly fatal.</p>
<p>The stomach, as a hollow organ, when distressed, leads to abdominal distension and difficulty in bowel movements, joint pains, inability to hold food down, continuous vomiting, and abdominal pain with the cold, making it impossible to consume cold items. Severe pain can lead to tightness in the abdomen and sides, an inability to keep food down, heart pain, and blockage in the upper and lower regions, with revulsion towards the smell of food and aversion to conversation, shivering, and a craving for stretching.</p>
<p>When the upper jiao is cold, food cannot be ingested, it results in the vomiting of sour fluids, chest and back pain, dryness in the throat, and inability to retain fluids. If both internal and external conditions are weak, leading to an inability to lie comfortably, feeling cold, a thin and weak pulse, and continuous vomiting without being able to consume food, such a condition will be fatal.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong><br><strong>By Wang Shuhe, Jin Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulse for Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>In the pulse at the right hand&#39;s inch point, if the Yin is full, this corresponds to the hand Taiyin channel. The patient suffers from lung distension, sweating like dew, upper respiratory difficulties, and a sensation of obstruction in the throat, akin to wanting to vomit.  </p>
<p>For the pulse at the left hand&#39;s guan position, if both Yin and Yang are full, this indicates that both the foot Jueyin and Shaoyang channels are also full. The patient suffers from stomach distension and reversed vomiting, with food not digesting.  </p>
<p>If the pulse at the right hand&#39;s guan position is Yin deficient, this corresponds to the foot Taiyin channel. The patient suffers from diarrhea, abdominal fullness with upward Qi, cholera-like vomiting, jaundice, agitation, inability to lie down, and borborygmi.  </p>
<p>If the pulse at the inch point is thin, accompanied by fever and vomiting, administering Huangqin Longdan Decoction is advisable. If vomiting does not cease, it is appropriate to use Tangerine Peel and Platycodon Decoction, along with moxibustion at Zhongfu point.  </p>
<p>If the guan pulse is slippery, indicating heat in the stomach, it is considered that the heat is full; due to fullness of Qi, the patient has no desire to eat, and if food is ingested, it leads to vomiting. In such cases, administering Ziwan Decoction to purge it, or Dapingwei pill, or applying needles to the stomach channel to drain is recommended.  </p>
<p>For a floating and large guan pulse, it suggests wind in the stomach, indicated by opening the mouth and raising the shoulders, with a sense of dullness in the heart, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If the pulse feels tight and slippery, it is attributed to the movement of roundworms.  </p>
<p>For febrile diseases lasting four to five days, with headaches, abdominal pain, and vomiting, if the pulse is strong and thin, death occurs on the twelfth day. A rapid pulse at the inch point indicates vomiting.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Pulse for Vomiting Roundworms</strong></p>
<p>The pulse at the guan location is slightly floating, with accumulated heat in the stomach causing vomiting of roundworms and a forgetful heart.<br><strong>Pulse Canon</strong> [Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe]</p>
<p><strong>Pulse for Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>The Song of Pulses states: Yang pulses indicate vomiting along with headaches.<br>The Spleen Pulse Song states: All three regions are slack, indicating heat in the spleen; foul breath and stomach churn lead to prolonged vomiting and reversal. If there is tightness, spleen pain will also occur, accompanied by muscle tension. The urge to vomit may be present but is not fulfilled; the feeling of urgency remains unresolved. Many illnesses stem from cold; check carefully under the fingers for slow and prolonged pulses. Vomiting and reversal can be irregular for several days; how long will the stomach energy troubled by the heart last? Slippery pulses are found primarily in the cun position, leading to frequent vomiting and reversal.<br>The Miscellaneous Diseases Life and Death Song states: Internal fullness leads to abdominal bloating and pain, with strong pressure below the heart and frequent dry heaving. Hands and feet feel hot, with fine and deep pulsations; frequent urination and difficulty may lead to death. External fullness connected to internal heat leads to vomiting; clearing the stomach is hard and uneasy. Suddenly diagnosing a large, strong pulse means do not expend efforts—healing will not occur.<br>Generally, tightness is felt in the pulses of the cun and guan positions, resembling a needle, indicating increased vomiting. This illness from toxic agents requires urgent rescue; hasten to seek divine medicine for life’s urgency.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Vomiting Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>In cases of spleen disease, the complexion is yellow, the body appears blue, urination is abnormal, there is direct staring, lips are retracted, nails are bluish, there is regurgitation of food, heaviness in the body with joint pain, limbs are immobile. The pulse should be floating, large, and slow, but if it is instead tight and rapid, and the complexion is yellow but appears blue, this signifies the wood overcoming the earth, indicating a major reversal, which is ten times fatal and untreatable. For minor yin disease, if food is ingested and immediately vomited, with a feeling of irritation in the heart but unable to vomit again, it is advisable to induce vomiting. If there is retained food in the upper abdomen, it is also advisable to vomit.  </p>
<p>In cases of heart disease with restlessness, minimal energy, great heat, heat rising to the heart, vomiting, coughing, wild speech, sweating profusely like beads, and coldness in the body, the pulse should be floating, but instead it is deep, slippery, and the complexion should be red but appears black. This signifies the water overcoming the fire, indicating a major reversal, which is ten times fatal and untreatable.  </p>
<p>In cases where the lower jiao feels like a drain, if there is fullness, there will be no smooth passage of urine or bowel movements, reversed qi continues, and vomiting is uncontrollable, hence termed &quot;running feeding.&quot; In cases of jaundice, if it occurs in the yin region, the person will definitely vomit; if it occurs in the yang region, the person will feel cold with slight fever.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If a person suffers from alcoholic jaundice, and there is no fever, with clear speech, a full abdomen, and a desire to vomit, they should be induced to vomit using a decoction of seven herbs, including bitter gentian. In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there is usually difficulty in urination; the signs include heat in the chest and heat in the feet.</p>
<p>For those who vomit, the pulse resembles that of someone just rising from bed: it is tight in the yang, while the yin is rapid; such a person will vomit immediately after eating. A floating and rapid pulse also indicates vomiting. If at the cun pulse (thumb pulse) it is tight and hollow, the tightness indicates cold, while the hollow indicates deficiency. Cold and deficiency counteract each other, leading to the pulse becoming slow and weak, which can result in choking. If the pulse at the guan (wrist pulse) is rapid, the person will vomit. If the pulse at the foot yang is weak and slow, this indicates diarrhea; slow suggests downward force, while weak suggests vomiting, making it difficult for food to enter. If the foot yang pulse is floating, it signifies deficiency of stomach qi and cold above, with anxiety below. When these two forces compete, the person will vomit and be unable to eat, feeling as terrified as if facing death; relief is found when they feel relaxed.</p>
<p>If someone vomits and the pulse is weak, urination becomes more beneficial, and there is slight body heat; this condition is hard to treat. When taking herbal decoctions that cause vomiting, start with three taels of licorice boiled in three sheng of water, yielding two sheng for consumption; this should cause vomiting. If this does not induce vomiting, it is even better. Once the body settles down, consume the remaining decoction, which will ensure proper flow without further vomiting. For those who tend to vomit, eating plenty of fresh ginger is a holy remedy.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Book on Living Humans</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Gong, Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vomiting Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>After three or four days of typhoid, if there is pain in the chest and sides, or deafness, or bitterness in the mouth with dryness of the tongue, or alternating cold and heat with vomiting, and the pulse is tight, this indicates an illness in the Lesser Yang Gallbladder Meridian. If the Taiyang illness does not resolve and shifts to Lesser Yang, with fullness and tightness underneath the ribs, dry heaving preventing eating, and alternating cold and heat, it is too early to induce vomiting or purging; if the pulse is tight, the treatment is Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. The pulse is thin and tight, with headaches and fever, belonging to Lesser Yang. When Lesser Yang is affected, symptoms include bitterness in the mouth, dryness in the throat, and dizziness; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated to release the exterior, but sweating should not be induced, as it leads to a confused state. A confused state pertains to the stomach; when the stomach is harmonized, recovery occurs; if not harmonized, there will be restlessness; hence, Tiaogai Chengqi Decoction is appropriate, involving both Lesser Yang and Yangming. </p>
<p>For vomiting, purging should not be applied. Zhang Jing states: “Although there are Yangming symptoms with much vomiting, purging should not be done.” In Yangming illness, hardness and fullness appear below the ribs, with no bowel movement yet vomiting, and a white coating on the tongue signifies the use of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. When the upper jiao (region) is unobstructed, fluids can descend, the stomach qi harmonizes, and profuse sweating occurs, allowing for relief. </p>
<p>Without Yang, there is collapse; without Yin, there is vomiting. Vomiting pertains to the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian, as the downward flow of Foot Yangming Qi is now reversed and ascends, leading to counterflow Qi, which causes vomiting. Zhang Jing states: “Though there is much vomiting and no bowel movement, purging should not be applied; one may use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. When the upper jiao is unobstructed, fluids can descend, the stomach qi harmonizes, and sweat will abundantly emerge, leading to resolution.”<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>In general, the causes of vomiting vary, and each has its own treatment method. However, Xiao Chai Hu Tang is particularly important here. For those with fullness in the chest and sides accompanied by vomiting, and who experience tidal fever in the afternoon, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with the addition of Mangxiao. If vomiting persists, with an urgent sensation beneath the heart and mild irritability, then Da Chai Hu Tang should be used. For constipation, add Dahuang to the formula. Da Chai Hu is especially effective for vomiting due to the presence of Zhishi. Zhishi eliminates filth and suppresses excess qi. It must be noted to remove Dahuang. Zhongjing states: Even with much vomiting and signs of Yangming, caution is necessary not to purge. Guanjuguo Jiegeng Tang is also quite effective and uses Zhishi. Ancient practitioners often treated vomiting with Banxia and fresh ginger. Master Sun says: Fresh ginger is the sacred medicine for vomiting. Zhongjing always uses it to treat vomiting. When Taiyang and Yangming are combined in illness, purging and diuresis are common; if only vomiting occurs, use Gegen Jia Banxia Shengjiang Tang. For those with heat in the chest, evil qi in the stomach, and abdominal pain with a desire to vomit, Huanglian Tang is indicated. When Taiyang and Shaoyang combine to cause diarrhea, if vomiting occurs, Huangqin Jia Banxia Shengjiang Tang should be used. In the &quot;Jinkui&quot;: For those who vomit and cannot expel food, options include Xiaobanxia Tang, Xiaobanxia Jia Fuling Tang, or Xiaobanxia Jia Jupi Tang. For vomiting accompanied by fever, Xiao Chai Hu Tang is indicated. For vomiting with thirst, Zhuling Tang should be used. If vomiting occurs before thirst, this indicates a desire to relieve; promptly provide water. If thirst occurs before vomiting, this indicates stagnant water beneath the heart, which is a symptom of fluid retention.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Zhongjing said: If someone has thirst and vomits after drinking water, it is due to the inappropriate use of Chaihu; one should treat the water in the diaphragm with Chifu Ling Decoction. If there is vomiting with Shaoyin syndrome, use Zhenwu Decoction minus Fuzi and add fresh ginger. If there is sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea followed by restlessness and inability to sleep, and they also vomit, use Zhizhi and Fresh Ginger Decoction. For those who vomit after the resolution of a febrile disease, there is residual heat in the stomach; use Bamboo Leaf Decoction with fresh ginger. </p>
<p>Generally, for vomiting, food does not go down. Dry vomiting, known today as retching, may occur due to sweating, water, or diarrhea, with heat in the spleen and stomach causing dry vomiting; the best treatment is Gancao Decoction. Zhongjing&#39;s treatment methods: if sweating occurs and there is dry vomiting, it is a Gui Zhi condition. If the exterior is unresolved, and there is water qi beneath the heart, resulting in dry vomiting and fever, it signifies Xiao Qinglong. If the body feels cool, sweating occurs, and there is pain in the sides or dry vomiting, it indicates Shizao Decoction. If there is Shaoyin diarrhea with a weak pulse, and Bai Tong Decoction causes continued diarrhea, with fainting and a reverse pulse along with dry vomiting and distress, use Bai Tong Decoction with pig bile. In cases of Shaoyin diarrhea, with internal cold and external heat, a faint pulse nearly absent or dry vomiting, use Tong Mai Si Wu Decoction. For dry vomiting with foamy saliva and headache, use Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. </p>
<p>According to the Treatise on Febrile Diseases, if one desires to vomit after eating grains, it is due to Yangming; Wu Zhu Yu Decoction should be used. If using the decoction exacerbates the condition, it relates to the upper jiao. Zhongjing does not have a treatment method for this. In general, Wu Zhu Yu Decoction treats Shaoyin syndrome.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If food enters the stomach and causes vomiting, it belongs to the Yangming channel and should be treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the patient suffers solely from vomiting, along with weakness or pain in the feet, it indicates foot Qi disorder and should be treated as such, following the methods for foot Qi. </p>
<p>Vomiting can arise from either cold or heat. If the pulse at the cun position is rapid, the palms are hot, and the patient is thirsty and vomiting, this indicates heat in the stomach, and Wu Ling San should be administered. In cases of febrile disease with exterior signs and a thirst for water, if water is ingested and then vomited, this is called water reversal, caused by heat in the heart affecting the small intestine, and Wu Ling San should be taken. After sweating, water or medicinal substances should not be ingested, as it would be counterproductive. </p>
<p>If sweating continues, it will lead to persistent vomiting, and Xiao Ban Xia Jia Fu Ling Tang or Da Ban Xia Jia Ju Pi Tang should be prescribed. If there has been prior sweating and the pulse at Guan position is weak, indicating that the stomach is cold and empty, resulting in vomiting, then Gan Jiang Huang Qin Huang Lian Ren Shen Tang should be used. If there is excessive cold with no desire for water but still vomiting, then Li Zhong Tang should be adjusted by removing the Atractylodes and adding fresh ginger. </p>
<p>In cases of Shaoyin disease where eating or drinking leads to vomiting, a warm sensation in the heart accompanies nausea, and there is coldness in the hands and feet with a wiry and slow pulse, this indicates fullness in the chest, and should not be treated with purging but rather with vomiting. If there is cold and fluid above the diaphragm causing dry heaves, it should not be forced out but warmed instead, and Si Ni Tang is indicated. </p>
<p>For cases of vomiting, cold hands and feet, and severe agitation, Wu Zhu Yu Tang should be used. If there is recovery from a febrile disease but weakness and a desire to vomit, then Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang is appropriate. </p>
<p>If the body feels cold with sweating, accompanied by pain in the flanks or dry heaving, this represents the condition of Shi Zao Tang. </p>
<p>—Jisheng Fang by Yan Yonghe, Song Dynasty<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>A person receives life from the central essence of Heaven and Earth, and the stomach is the primary organ in this process. The stomach receives food and drink, while the spleen governs transformation and transportation, producing blood and qi to regulate the entire body. If the spleen and stomach are unharmed, there will be no issue of vomiting. However, if there are disturbances such as improper diet—be it hot or cold, excessive consumption of raw or fatty foods, or exposure to dampness and wind—this can upset the stomach. Once the stomach is affected, spleen qi stagnates, causing a mix of clear and turbid substances, leading to blockages in the middle jiao and resulting in vomiting. This primarily addresses the issues arising from dietary excess and the effects of cold, wind, and dampness. Additionally, emotional distress can also harm the body, and if there is residual cold in the stomach, phlegm may accumulate, or evil heat may invade the stomach, causing blood stasis, all of which can lead to vomiting. One should assess these conditions carefully when faced with illness.</p>
<p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>All sour vomit, rapid forced downward expulsion, falls under the category of heat. It flows without spoiling and moves without decay, hence the vomiting. Sour vomit occurs when there is significant heat in the stomach cavity, leading to qi stagnation; undigested substances become sour. Sourness corresponds to the flavor of the liver wood. Some claim sour vomiting indicates cold, which is a misconception. When heat is significant in the stomach cavity, it leads to vomiting, reflecting the ascent of fire energy. Sourness relates to the flavor of liver wood. Excessive fire can overpower metal, inhibiting the balance of wood, which leads the liver to become excessive and thus sour. Eating hot foods can easily lead to sourness as well. Those who interpret sour vomiting as a cold condition are mistaken.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Just as the taste of wine is bitter and its nature is warming, it can nourish the heart&#39;s fire. Therefore, consuming it makes one’s complexion red, breath coarse, pulse strong and rapid, speech slurred and rambling, singing alternating between sadness and laughter, with emotions like madness, recklessness, forgetfulness, thirst, and vomiting—these are all signs of heat. The vomit is sure to be sour, indicating clear heat. Moreover, when there is heat, all five flavors are rich. The classics state: &quot;On the earth, transformation occurs, giving rise to the five flavors, all belonging to the earth.&quot; Yet when earth is strong and victorious over water, it cannot control fire, thus fire grows excessively. Therefore, when the five flavors are heated and the food is rich, the flavors are also dense. Hence, when there is liver heat, the mouth feels sour; when there is heart heat, the mouth feels bitter; when there is spleen heat, the mouth feels sweet; when there is lung heat, the mouth feels pungent; when there is kidney heat, the mouth feels salty. If the mouth is bland, this indicates stomach heat. The stomach belongs to the earth, which is the mother of all things, making the stomach the foundation of the body, with blandness being the basis of the five flavors. Thus, is sour vomit not attributable to coldness? Those who incorrectly argue it results from cold merely claim it is due to excessive damage causing hard, sticky, slippery effects, or the damaging of cold substances, resulting in a preference for vinegary, sour ingestion. Therefore, popular medicine tends to focus on moderately warming the spleen and stomach. How could they know that the classics say when one is harmed by cold, it results in illness of heat?<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>When cold harms the skin and hair, the pores become tightly closed, causing the Yang energy to stagnate and unable to flow, resulting in heat. Therefore, when there is exterior heat due to cold damage, it indicates that the heat is on the surface; it is advisable to use a formulation like Mahuang Decoction with warm, acrid, and spicy herbs to disperse it, allowing the pores to open, sweat to release, and heat to retreat, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>Whenever there is internal injury from cold substances, it could either be that Yin exceeds Yang, causing a cold disease, or that cold and heat combat each other, leading to stagnant Yang energy in the intestines and stomach, resulting in heat. There are also cases where internal cold substances result in symptoms of heat; achieving a great sweat to release heat can lead to recovery and cooling of the body. </p>
<p>If the symptoms are mild and not associated with other diseases, merely resulting in sourness in the stomach, commonly referred to as &quot;sour heart,&quot; the appropriate method is to use warming herbs to disperse it, similar to how one would treat surface conditions, allowing the stagnation in the intestines and stomach to open up, dispersing the heat and restoring harmony. </p>
<p>However, if one has been consuming sour substances for a long time without improvement, warming treatment is not advisable; instead, cooling medicines should be administered first, followed by cooling herbs to adjust. Once the congestion and heat are resolved, the energy will be in harmony.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Therefore, one should not eat sticky and greasy foods when experiencing acidity, as this can cause the yang energy to become obstructed and stagnant, leading to discomfort, similar to food being trapped in a vessel and generating heat that then turns sour. It is advisable to consume coarse grains and vegetables, which can help the energy flow smoothly. </p>
<p>Vomiting foul substances occurs when the stomach and intestines are cold, resulting in improper transformation and transmission. If one can control the malevolent forces, one must also strengthen oneself. Hence, the cold overcomes fire, leading to a predominance of metal and resulting in foul vomiting. Foulness reflects the smell of metal. Therefore, when there is heat, one experiences sour and foul vomiting; when cold, it is foul due to dampness, similar to how hot rice porridge easily turns sour, while cold water has a foul taste.</p>
<p>Generally, vomiting indicates an upward fire disturbance, regardless of whether it is internal or external, so cooling diaphoretics are appropriate. For all types of vomiting related to typhoid and miscellaneous diseases, the formula &quot;Tuning the Stomach with Chengqi Decoction&quot; is appropriate. For feelings of irritation and dry heaving, use &quot;Huanglian Jiedu Decoction.&quot; For vomiting with thirst, consider &quot;Guiling Ganlu Drink&quot; or &quot;Wuling Powder.&quot; For dizziness accompanied by cough and vomiting, &quot;Baihu Decoction with Banxia and Chenpi.&quot; For cold-induced vomiting, characterized by limbs feeling cold and reversed, use &quot;Qingliang Tiaogai Powder.&quot; In cases of severe internal dampness and nausea, along with vomiting, &quot;Baihu Jiedu Decoction&quot; is indicated.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Clarity</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Vomiting</strong>  </p>
<p>How can we elucidate the vomiting of febrile diseases? Vomiting, referred to as &quot;ou&quot; in sound, is commonly called &quot;chuo.&quot; To vomit means to expel substances, which is why there is dry retching but no dry vomiting. Thus, regarding vomiting, we say that one feels a desire to vomit after consuming grains, and when vomiting occurs, it indicates that food and drink are immediately expelled, hence we can discern the severity of vomiting.<br>In cases of febrile illnesses, vomiting can be attributed to heat or cold; however, scholars of vomiting all assert it&#39;s due to Yang deficiency. The classics state: &quot;In Yin disease, there is abdominal fullness and vomiting, inability to eat, with much benefit in self-care, occasionally the abdomen causes pain.&quot; It also states: &quot;There is internal cold in the stomach, hence the vomiting.&quot; However, the theorists on vomiting disagree. Vomiting can be caused by heat or cold, retained drink, or the presence of pus in the stomach; all must be clearly distinguished.<br>Vomiting accompanied by fever signifies a condition where Chai Hu decoction is indicated, especially with persistent vomiting, anxiety beneath the heart, and mild irritation; thus, Da Chai Hu decoction is prescribed for those whose vomiting arises from evil heat. If there is cold drink obstructing the diaphragm causing dry retching, it should not be expelled but warmed; if the dry retching involves saliva and headaches, Wu Zhu Yu decoction is indicated, indicating that cold evil causes vomiting.<br>If one first vomits and then feels thirst, this indicates a desire for relief; if one first feels thirst and then vomits, it indicates water stagnation below the heart—this belongs to the theorists on retained drink, hence this is the type of vomiting due to retained drinks.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>When there is vomiting due to the presence of pus in the stomach, it does not need to be treated; the pus will resolve itself. This vomiting is caused by the accumulation of pus in the stomach. Such cases, while they may differ, generally arise when the exterior evil of a cold disease tries to penetrate inward. If the internal energy rebels against this, vomiting results. Therefore, in cases where there is a combination of exterior and interior symptoms, vomiting is common.</p>
<p>In a cold disease, after three days, the yang aspect is exhausted and the yin becomes susceptible to evil. If a person can eat without vomiting, it indicates that the yin is not affected by the evil. Thus, when the evil energy penetrates inward, vomiting is bound to occur. </p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms associated with the decoction of dried ginger and aconite, if there is no vomiting and no thirst, it indicates that there is no heat in the interior. The symptoms of the Ten Dates Decoction indicate dry vomiting and shortness of breath, with sweating but no aversion to cold; this shows that the exterior has resolved while the interior has not been harmonized. From this perspective, the cause of vomiting can clearly be attributed to heat in the interior.</p>
<p>In cases of vomiting, if the energy is rebellious, it must be dispersed; if phlegm and fluids are involved, they must be eliminated. The &quot;Essentials of the Thousand Gold&quot; states that those with vomiting often take fresh ginger, which is considered a holy medicine for this condition as it helps disperse the rebellious energy. The &quot;Classic of the Golden Chamber&quot; mentions that for those who vomit, banxia (Pinellia) is used to eliminate water; when the fluid is removed, the vomiting stops, indicating the need to expel phlegm and fluids.</p>
<p>Even with abundant symptoms suggesting yangming (the Yangming channel), it is inappropriate to attack them, as the rebellious energy is causing accumulation. If vomiting is present along with a weak pulse, frequent urination, and mild fever with signs of apprehension, these conditions become difficult to treat, indicating severe deficiency and cold. </p>
<p>Therefore, practitioners must carefully assess the nature of the evil energy, whether it is deficient or excessive, and the reversal or orderly nature of the disease symptoms to properly apply medicine and aim for a cure.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p>
<h3>Eastern Garden Ten Books (Yuan Dynasty, Li Gao)</h3>
<h4>Regarding the Use of Medicine</h4>
<p>If there is excessive vomiting, it is not advisable to induce vomiting again. If one vomits and then has loose and weak stools, this indicates stagnation of the upper qi, which should be resolved with ginger and citrus. If there is vomiting accompanied by constipation, one should remedy the constipation; however, the use of Angelica, peach kernel, hemp seed, (wood) jujube seed, and soapberry seed should be avoided.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p>
<h3>On Vomiting</h3>
<p>Regarding vomiting, is there a differentiation in the channels involved? The answer is: the stomach governs comprehensively and has distinctions among the three channels of Taiyang, Yangming, and Shaoyang, based on the abundance or deficiency of Qi and blood, which affects the characteristics of sound and matter. Vomiting belongs to Taiyang, where there is matter but no sound, indicating a blood disease. If food enters, it leads to vomiting; if food is already present, it results in vomiting; if the duration is long, it continues to induce vomiting. Vomiting belongs to Yangming, characterized by both matter and sound, where Qi and blood are both affected. Zhang Zhongjing states: even if vomiting is frequent with Yangming evidence, one must not purge. Hiccups belong to Shaoyang, characterized by sound but no matter, indicating a Qi disease.</p>
<h3>On Vomiting</h3>
<p>In general, when there is sound and matter, it is called vomiting; when there is sound but no matter, it is called hiccuping. If there is heat in the stomach and phlegm in the diaphragm, the prescription is Er Chen Tang with stir-fried Gardenia, Huanglian, and fresh ginger. For those with chronic vomiting due to stomach deficiency and inability to digest food, use Ren Shen, fresh ginger, Huangqi, Baizhu, and Xiangfu. Generally, vomiting is chiefly governed by Banxia, Chenpi, and fresh ginger. Liu Hejian states that vomiting is due to rising fire qi; this is only one aspect. If there is phlegm in the middle jiao preventing food from descending, if there is Qi counterflow, if cold energy is stagnating at the stomach, if food is stagnating in the heart and lungs, leading to new food being expelled, or if there is both fire and phlegm in the stomach causing vomiting. For vomiting medications, avoid (cabbage) seed, apricot kernels, peach kernels, radish seeds, and Gardenia, as they all promote vomiting. Pills paired with aromatic herbs for dispersing purposes are acceptable.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>A strong吐is indicated, and those who are thirsty for water may die. Drinking children&#39;s urine is the most wonderful remedy. For nausea, with phlegm, heat, and deficiency, fresh ginger is used, along with appropriate adjuncts based on symptoms. It is said that for those experiencing nausea without sound or material, feeling the urge to vomit but unable to do so, although it is called nausea, it is not a heart issue but rather related to the stomach, thus ginger is recommended as it can stimulate the stomach and help clear phlegm. </p>
<p>For those feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit but unable to, with a sense of heaviness within, similar to the fear of a boat, it is advisable to use Baixia Decoction, or Xiaobai Xia and Fuling Decoction, or the Lirong Decoction with added Baixia. If there is heat in the stomach causing nausea, the most effective remedy is to combine Erchen Decoction with ginger juice, fried Huanglian, and Huangqin, each with a measure of one qian.</p>
<p>If there is a case of tapeworm, it stems from cold in the stomach. The classics state: the tapeworm is a long worm. When the stomach is cold, it leads to the expulsion of tapeworms. It is advisable to use the Lirong Decoction with five particles of fried Chuanjiao, half a qian of betel nut, and take Wumei pills. It is known that the tapeworm is repelled by pepper.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The Bureau of Discussion【Yuan Zhu Zhenheng】</p>
<p><strong>Vomiting Sourness</strong></p>
<p>Some say: Vomiting sourness is considered heat in the &quot;Suwen,&quot; while Dongyuan claims it to be cold. Why is that? I say: Vomiting sourness is different from swallowing sourness. Vomiting sourness refers to expelling sour fluid like vinegar; usually, the fluids accumulate and rise, formed from stagnation over time. Long-term accumulation leads to heat generated within the moisture, thus creating a sour taste; how can it be anything but heat? If it accumulates for too long and cannot rise and expel, lying between the lungs and stomach, unable to rise or descend, and if there’s wind-cold on the surface, the internal heat becomes even more stagnant, and the sour taste pricks the heart. When the surface is warmed, and the pores open, taking warm fragrant decoctions may temporarily relieve it; how can it be anything but cold? When the &quot;Suwen&quot; refers to heat, it speaks of the root; Dongyuan refers to cold, speaking of the end. However, Dongyuan does not mention that wind-cold from outside causes the condition, asserting that it wants to drain the lung&#39;s essence, claiming that cold medicines cannot treat sourness. Instead, it uses gastric soothing decoction and modified Erchen decoction, both involving cloves, yet lacks a method to treat damp-heat accumulation, which does not align with the teachings. I once treated swallowing sourness with prepared Huanglian and Zhuyu, adjusted according to seasonal changes. Cangzhu and Fuling served as the main remedies, with decoction soaked in pancake made into small pills to swallow, while instructing to include coarse foods and vegetables in diet for nourishment; thus, recovery is easier.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Tracing Back to Gather</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Wang Lu】</p>
<p><strong>Vomiting, Dry Heaving, and Reverse Coughing Distinction</strong></p>
<p>I once read Cheng Wujia&#39;s &quot;Theoretical Clarifications on Cold Damage&quot; which states: Vomiting is accompanied by sound, whereas heaving is merely heaving. Hence, there is dry heaving and no dry vomiting. Therefore, when discussing vomiting, it is said that there is a desire to vomit from food intake; and when discussing throwing up, it is said that food and drink enter and then are immediately vomited, thus indicating the severity of vomiting can be understood. Furthermore, it also says: heaving is commonly referred to as reverse coughing. I harbor doubts regarding this. Hence, I consulted Zhang Zhongjing’s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; to verify and refine this statement. Zhang’s work mentions vomiting, throwing up, dry heaving, and heaving extensively, while reverse coughing is mentioned only twice. I therefore observe these distinctions collectively. Vomiting refers, as Dongyuan said, to sounds and substances expelled simultaneously. Throwing up refers to substances expelled without sound. As for dry heaving and heaving, both produce sounds without expelling substances. Dongyuan merely categorized these under heaving without discussing dry heaving. The distinction between dry heaving and heaving must lie somewhere; it is merely a matter of degree. Hence, Zhang Zhongjing speaks plainly of dry heaving, while regarding heaving he states: after sweating due to solar attack and fire exhaustion, prolonged conditions lead to delirium, and in severe cases to heaving.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>It is said: If a person with Yangming pattern wind has no bowel movement and is bloated with gas, they should not be treated. It is also said: Those who experience excessive vomiting and diarrhea, and are extremely weak with excessive sweating, may develop gas. Although there are cases that seem straightforward, when compared to dry vomiting, they are quite different. I have pondered this further: dry vomiting and gas are seen as one by Dong Yuan, but as two by Zhang Zhongjing. Viewed as one, they both involve a unique sound; viewed as two, dry vomiting is a slight form of gas, while gas is an extreme form of dry vomiting. Dry vomiting produces a light, short sound, whereas gas produces a heavy, long sound. Despite the distinctions of slight and extreme, they are fundamentally the same condition. Now, Cheng’s school considers vomiting as having sound and mixes it up with dry vomiting, and regards gas as a type of cough. This interpretation, I cannot accept. Zhang Zhongjing classifies them clearly: when both sound and material are present, it is called vomiting; when only material is expelled, it is called vomiting; and when only sound is heard, it is called dry vomiting. Because vomiting involves both sound and material, therefore, when there is sound without material, it is called dry (which means empty). As for vomiting, there must necessarily be material, so how can it be termed dry? Zhang Zhongjing added the character for &quot;dry&quot; to vomiting to differentiate it as a condition where both sound and material are present.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The Cheng clan interprets &quot;nausea&quot; as having a unique sound similar to that of dry heaving, which may lose the original meaning intended by Zhongjing. Zhongjing said: for those with a sore or pus, one cannot treat nausea; when the pus is gone, healing will occur by itself. To speak of &quot;nausea exhausting the pus,&quot; can one really say it has a unique sound? Regarding cases where one experiences nausea with soup, food, or excessive drinking, it cannot be regarded as having a unique sound either. Moreover, in the discussion on Shaoyin disease, when using the method of Tongmai Sijue Decoction, it describes symptoms including dry heaving. Why then does the subsequent text in the adjustment methods say to add ginger for those who experience nausea? If Zhongjing truly considered nausea to have a unique sound, he would not have named it &quot;dry heaving.&quot; Observing the texts, when it explicitly mentions both nausea and dry heaving, it indicates that their meanings are distinct; is this not evident? Furthermore, Zhongjing has mentioned the desire to heave and the desire to vomit, but has never spoken of the desire for dry heaving or retching. The term &quot;desire&quot; pertains to something about to be expelled but has not yet done so, and it reflects a sensation of something tangible. For tangible items that are about to emerge from the chest or diaphragm, even if they have not yet come out, one can sense them beforehand.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>If there is no audible sound of shape, then one cannot foresee what will emerge; one must wait until it has emerged before it can be known. The act of vomiting and spitting concerns tangible substances, thus it may be called desire. Dry heaving and retching, concerning formless sounds, thus cannot be called desire. Cheng Shi cites the phrases about eating grain and wanting to vomit, and consuming food only to immediately spit it out, and he claims that vomiting and spitting have different weights. His intention is to ascribe lightness to desire as expressed in vomiting, while spitting is considered heavy in its immediate action. How can one know that desire is not merely expressed as &#39;want&#39;—this set is primarily based on form and formlessness, not on weight distinctions? If it is as he says, then one with hot soup would vomit, one with food would also vomit, and when one feels a warm desire to vomit, the reverse urge to vomit would not originate from Zhongjing? He also cites popular usage of the term &#39;chew&#39; to support his point about vomiting. However, &#39;chew&#39; and &#39;retching&#39; are different in writing but similar in sound and meaning; thus, using &#39;chew&#39; to support vomiting is too shallow. Nonetheless, comparing vomiting and spitting, spitting is lighter than vomiting, and comparing spitting and dry heaving, dry heaving is lighter than spitting. However, each of these three has its own weight distinctions that cannot be firmly fixed. Yet, comparing vomiting, spitting, dry heaving, and retching, retching is indeed the heaviest, and cannot be compared to the other three. Therefore, the &quot;Tai Su&quot; states: a tree sheds its leaves when its illness is deep, and when one reaches the state of retching, the treatment becomes challenging and is ultimately not easy to manage.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Therapy</strong><br><strong>(Yuan – Zhang Jiegu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vomit Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of vomit: those resulting from accumulation of cold. They can be analyzed through the three jiaos (regions): the upper jiao is located at the stomach, connecting to the heavenly qi, and is responsible for receiving but not expelling; the middle jiao is at the zhongwan (center of the abdomen), connecting above to the heavenly qi and below to the earthly qi, responsible for digesting food and water; the lower jiao is below the navel, connecting to the earthly qi, responsible for expelling but not receiving.</p>
<p>Thus, if there is vomiting from the upper jiao, it arises from the interaction with qi. Qi is the yang of heaven, having a floating and surging pulse. The symptoms include vomiting soon after eating, thirst for water, constipation, and a sensation of uplift in the chest causing pain. Treatment should focus on redirecting qi downwards and harmonizing the middle jiao.</p>
<p>For vomiting from the middle jiao, it arises from accumulation, influenced by both yin and yang, where food and qi combine to cause pain due to accumulation. The pulse is floating and string-like. The symptoms may include pain preceding vomiting, or vomiting preceding pain. The treatment method should involve using mild toxic herbs to eliminate the accumulation, such as betel nut and wood incense to harmonize the qi.</p>
<p>For vomiting from the lower jiao, it arises from cold, an earthly condition. The pulse is deep and slow. Symptoms include vomiting food eaten in the morning by evening, or food eaten in the evening by morning, clear and smooth urination, with constipation being hard to pass. The treatment method should involve using strong toxic herbs to relieve the blockage and warm the cold condition, gradually facilitating bowel movements, and then using middle jiao herbs to harmonize, preventing constipation from resolving on its own.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong> (Yuan Dynasty - Luo Tianyi)</p>
<p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For excessive vomiting, use the prepared herb formula &quot;Li Zhong Wan&quot;, replacing the white atractylodes with fresh ginger. Vomiting is often due to reversed Qi; the bland nature of atractylodes can obstruct this, making it unsuitable for non-reversed Qi cases. The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text states that individuals suffering from vomiting frequently take fresh ginger, which is considered a sacred medicine for this ailment. Fresh ginger is pungent and dispersive; thus, it should be added abundantly for those who vomit.</p>
<p>In cases of cold-induced vomiting with body heat or no heat, treatment includes Xiao Ban Xia decoction with poria, or Xiao Ban Xia decoction with tangerine peel, or a decoction of dried ginger, yellow qin, yellow lily, and ginseng. If vomiting is accompanied by cold extremities or agitation, use the &quot;Si Ni&quot; decoction.</p>
<p>If there is cold in the organs causing Ascaris to rise and induce vomiting, this indicates weak cold Qi in the stomach rather than actual coldness. The treatment should involve Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot;.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Evidence-Based Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between vomiting and regurgitation has been discussed in the Treatise on Cold Damage, yet the symptoms are not uniform: there is cold vomiting, hot vomiting, qi vomiting, phlegm vomiting, food vomiting, blood vomiting, roundworm vomiting, nausea, and dry heaving. Aside from hot vomiting and blood vomiting, in recent times the terms for vomiting are generally interchangeable, yet this does not lead to significant issues, nor does it contradict any principles. Additionally, for treatment, a small dose of Banxia Fuling Decoction or Erchen Decoction with extra ginger decocted is advisable. Fresh ginger is the sacred medicine for vomiting. Severe pain accompanied by a color resembling greens indicates death. For cold vomiting, cold stagnation in the middle, with a preference for spicy foods, and any hot substance ingested is immediately vomited, one should use Erchen Decoction with ten cloves of clove or Li Zhong Decoction with half a qian of bitter orange. If ineffective, then use Wenzhong Decoction, and in severe cases, attach with Fuzi Li Zhong Decoction or Ding Fu Decoction, and it must be taken cold. Cold encounters cold to merge, thus helping to avoid vomiting.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>If there is phlegm and fluid, when porridge or medicine reaches the mouth, it is immediately expelled; people all say it is a reversal of the stomach, but this is not the case. This is caused by phlegm and qi being blocked between the throat and diaphragm. It is advisable to first administer a ginger and perilla decoction with Ling sha pill, and when the medicine can be ingested, then follow with a qi-regulating remedy. </p>
<p>For external conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea, or dysentery, or cold abdominal pain, if hot medicines are administered too abruptly, it can lead to vomiting and reversal. It is advisable to use Er Chen Tang with half a qian of sand ginger and white cardamom; if severe, add a little agarwood. </p>
<p>In cases of cold, heat, qi, food, phlegm, and blood causing vomiting, there may be issues of leakage of qi or &quot;running milk.&quot; Leakage of qi occurs when there is heat in the upper jiao, requiring the food to be expelled before it can descend; sweating and bodily heat in the stomach can result. &quot;Running milk&quot; occurs when there is heat in the lower jiao, causing qì to reverse and preventing the continuation of normal bowel movements, leading to uncontrollable vomiting.</p>
<p>Any situation where administering hot medicine worsens one&#39;s condition should be approached from the perspective of cold vomiting. For hot vomiting, it is advisable to use Er Chen Tang with one qian of huanglian. For qi vomiting, characterized by fullness in the chest and obstruction in the diaphragm, constant fullness even without eating, and regular reversal of qi and vomiting after eating, this is due to excessive anger during eating and drinking.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>It is advisable to use Erchen Decoction with half a cash of bitter orange and hawthorn, or the Wuzhuyu Decoction; if ineffective, then use Dingchen Toupge Decoction or Wuge Kuan Zhong Decoction. </p>
<p>Vomiting is often caused by emotional disturbances and can also result from external pathogenic influences or irregular eating and drinking. Generally, treatment should prioritize regulating the middle. Use Erchen Decoction with one cash of bitter orange, or add seven parts of nansheng, and four parts each of sandalwood and musk, which is also good. Alternatively, one can take just the Zhinnan Decoction or the Phlegm-Guide Decoction.</p>
<p>There may also be phlegm lodged in the middle burner that is triggered by cold, commonly referred to as &quot;cold convulsions.&quot; For this, one may use the new Banxia Decoction or the Spleen Grab Decoction. If vomiting is accompanied by heat phlegm, it is advisable to use a small Banxia and Fuling Decoction with bamboo leaf the size of a cash coin. If vomiting phlegm leads to a feeling of constriction, known as “phlegm inversion,” it is beneficial to use Jiangfu Decoction, substituting fresh fu for cooked fu.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Nausea and dry heaving, with a desire to vomit but unable to do so, the heart feels unsettled as if fearing a ship&#39;s rocking. A suitable remedy is Banxia Decoction, or small Banxia and Poria Decoction, or Li Zhong Decoction and Zhi Zhong Decoction, all of which can be used. </p>
<p>If vomiting medications are ineffective, one should use stabilizing and heavy medicines to settle the rebellious qi; it is advised to use Jiangsu Decoction together with Ling Sha Dan, with a dose composed of a hundred grains, waiting for the medicine to take effect before using Yang Zheng Dan or Banxieyuan to support recovery. </p>
<p>With vomiting, as the bodily fluids are depleted, there will certainly be thirst; one should not hastily conclude it to be heat merely due to thirst. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if vomiting medications are ineffective and there are no symptoms of prior phlegm or qi disturbances, it may be that roundworms are causing vomiting in the chest and diaphragm, causing movement upon medication, leading to rejection of the medicine; despite the absence of worm expulsion, it is still advisable to use expelling worm medications. Alternatively, add ten roasted Sichuan peppercorns into the vomiting remedy; the roundworm will avoid the pepper due to its effects. </p>
<p>There was a patient who used Fuzi Li Zhong Decoction and Si Ni Decoction with the addition of cloves, but began to vomit immediately upon ingestion. Later, they removed the dried ginger, only using Ren and Fu with Ding Mu and two spices, boiling them well, and then ground into sandalwood medicine; this immediately quelled the vomiting.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The accumulation of phlegm and qi signifies a blockage; when using boiling herbs like Ding and Fu, combined with organs like Chen and Mu, the flow can resume. Dry ginger and white atractylodes can be suffocating. For wind-cold causing vomiting, there are cold and heat symptoms. If there is nothing to vomit, it is called dry retching; if there is something, it is true vomiting. Why is vomiting associated with something? Ancient texts mention dry retching, but not dry vomiting. </p>
<p>When the Taiyang and Yangming channels are affected together, symptoms include body heat, headache, stiff neck, irritability with heat, dry nose, sore eyes, and vomiting. In such cases, use Ge Gen Decoction with an added amount of Ban Xia (1 qian). </p>
<p>When the Taiyang and Shaoyang channels are affected together, symptoms include headache, lower back pain, alternating chills and fever, chest and flank pain, and vomiting. In this case, use Huang Qin Decoction plus 1.5 qian of Ban Xia, and add five slices of fresh ginger for decoction. </p>
<p>If the Shaoyang symptoms are present without being interconnected with other conditions, with vomiting and heat, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If there are clear Yangming symptoms and although there seems to be something that should be purged, accompanied by considerable vomiting, this still pertains to the upper jiao; hence, do not hastily purge. Instead, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is advisable.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>If the sun disease is not combined with lesser yang and bright yang, but only presents with sun symptoms, or if there is vomiting and diarrhea, it is feared that the patient has phlegm and stagnant fluids in the diaphragm. In this case, administer Erchen Decoction; once the vomiting and diarrhea stabilize, gradually introduce herbs for clearing the sun meridian. If there is vomiting and thirst, use Zhuling Decoction; if thirst precedes vomiting, it indicates water in the diaphragm, so use Xiao Banxia and Fuling Decoction. If there is a strong desire to drink water but it is vomited immediately after consumption, and the thirst recurs post-vomiting, this is called water counterflow, indicating that heat in the heart is affecting the small intestine, and Wuling Powder should be used. If there is no thirst but vomiting or dry retching in lesser yin, modify Lichong Decoction by removing the baie and adding fresh ginger. If there is vomiting of saliva and foam, use Wuzhuyu Decoction. In cases of vomiting between greater yin and lesser yin, greater yin should use Lichong Decoction, while lesser yin should use Sini Decoction, both with ginger boiled in. The above represents the yin condition, which is the yin within yin, and therefore should use warming remedies. When yang enters yin, it can benefit without causing vomiting; vomiting belongs to the upper (stomach) and is nearer to the exterior. What enters from yang is deep, hence it provides benefit.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>When a patient who has recently recovered from a Yang disease experiences vomiting without any other cause, this is due to residual heat in the stomach. It is advisable to use either Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction. Generally, when a patient has Yang symptoms accompanied by vomiting, this indicates a combined illness; the vomiting suggests that the disease has progressed inward, and it is not simply a Yang condition. I recall a case where someone initially had Yang symptoms and persistent vomiting; when treated with warming prescriptions, there was no effect. Knowing that the Yang condition had been resolved through sweating, it was appropriate to use cooling medications, as the vomiting was due to Yang symptoms, not a combination with the Yangming or Shaoyang; thus, the vomiting was caused by heat and warm medications were ineffective. I have also witnessed a case with significant vomiting from Yang symptoms; in such instances, it sufficed to release the exterior without using emetic herbs. Additionally, there was a case where upon onset of the illness, with clear Yang symptoms and vomiting, everyone in the household displaying similar symptoms responded effectively to eight doses of Stomach Nourishing Decoction. At that time, the movement of Qi naturally aligned this way, indicating a case of cold damage with miscellaneous diseases, which should not be treated according to the regular principles of cold damage. If vomiting occurs with thirst due to summer heat, it is recommended to use Cold Agastache Decoction or Five-Ingredient Powder, along with summer relief pills.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>For persistent vomiting, use loquat leaf powder mixed with reed roots, and swallow with the herb Dan. If vomiting is accompanied by phlegm, take an antidote for summer heat, like the Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction or a summer relief drink. </p>
<p>For injury from alcohol, with nausea and vomiting of stagnant liquor, dizziness, and severe headaches, a remedy such as the Chonghe Decoction is appropriate, or the Banxia Fuling Decoction, or the Lijiang Decoction with seven parts of dried kudzu. Alternatively, mix powdered remedies with the Lijiang Decoction or the Sui Pi Drink.</p>
<p>For food-related issues causing chest distension, nausea, sour regurgitation, bad egg-smelling belching, and aversion to food, with headache, fever, and chills—symptoms resembling a cold but without body aches—use the Zhongtong Decoction with one qian of cardamom or take Hongyuanzizi or Xiao Qixiangyuanzh with it.</p>
<p>If overeating leads to food stagnation, causing nausea at the smell of food, use the Erchen Decoction with one qian of cardamom. If it doesn&#39;t improve, add half a qian of clove or use the Zhongtong Decoction with one qian of cardamom and ten pieces of clove. For severe continuous vomiting, if bowel movements are ineffective, apply the Zhishi Banxia Decoction with one qian of cardamom and half a qian of white cardamom, with a focus on throat soothing pills.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p>

<p><strong>Vomit and Swallow Sourness</strong></p>
<p>If there is phlegm-fire existing, with the chest and diaphragm feeling obstructed, causing sourness in the throat and difficulty in breathing, and if there are symptoms of vomiting and swallowing sourness, or if there is alcohol accumulation leading to diarrhea and pain, all of this is due to damp-heat. The treatment involves taking Zhi Zhu Pills with the addition of one tael each of grilled Huang Lian with ginger juice, roasted Bai Shao Yao, and Chen Pi, along with five qian each of gypsum and licorice, one qian each of sand-reducing agent and wood fragrance, and four qian of Chuan Xiong. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Vomiting sourness and swallowing sourness differ somewhat. Vomiting sourness occurs due to heat arising from dampness; swallowing sourness arises from internal deficiency and stagnation of heat. Both belong to the category of spleen and stomach deficiency-cold, being the latter stages of affliction. Thus, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; refers to fire concerning the manifestation of the illness. Dongyuan sees gastric cold as addressing the root cause of the illness. For all who suffer from this, one should first distinguish between vomiting and swallowing, and the treatment should primarily focus on tonifying the root essence. If cold and cool herbs are used, they will further harm stomach qi, leading to a blend of true and false conditions. If the spleen qi is deficient and food and drink cannot be processed, resulting in turbidity not descending, then one should use Liu Jun Zi Decoction to primarily tonify the spleen and stomach, with a slight addition of Yue Ju Pills for clearing. Therefore, Mr. Dongyuan states that if the evil heat does not affect the grain, mistakenly recognizing it as true heat and recklessly using cold and cool herbs will inevitably lead to a deterioration of the condition.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Vomit Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Introduction</strong>  <em>(Ming, Li Zhan)</em></p>
<p><strong>Separation of Wet and Dry Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Wet vomiting has sound and material; it occurs after eating. Dry vomiting is empty and has no material, both belong to conditions where Yangming Qi and Blood are diseased, hence vomiting is considered more severe than regurgitation. Heat-induced vomiting results in a bitter mouth, irritability, thirst, rapid pulse, warmth in the palms, while cold vomiting presents with headaches, fullness in the chest, cold extremities, and spitting froth; a slow pulse may accompany retching, and there are variations in clinical presentation. </p>
<p>In cases of damp vomiting, there is a transmission of superficial pathogens to the interior, causing the internal Qi to counterflow, thus many cases of overlapping patterns have abundant vomiting. When the three Yangs are febrile, they are treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang plus fresh ginger. For fullness in the chest accompanied by afternoon tidal fever, add Mangxiao. If vomiting is persistent and there are bowel issues, use Da Chai Hu Tang. For abundant vomiting indicating Yangming patterns but with a thin stomach unsuitable for purging, use Gan Ju Tang. For irritability and thirst, if vomiting precedes thirst, this indicates a desire for relief, treat with Zhu Ling Tang. If thirst occurs before vomiting, indicating water retention, use Chi Fu Ling Tang. If vomiting occurs immediately upon drinking water, apply Wu Ling San. For virtual thirst, utilize Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction with ginger juice, or use Zhi Shi Tang. For upper heat and lower cold vomiting, apply Huang Lian Tang. If there is cold in the stomach with diarrhea, cold extremities, and no thirst, use Li Zhong Tang minus Atractylodes with added ginger juice, or use Zheng Qi Tang with ginger juice. </p>
<p>Regarding the three conditions of Shaoyin: if there is cold drink above causing vomiting and spitting of foam, or if there is vomiting with diarrhea and thirst, treat with Si Ni San plus fresh ginger. If the pulse is deep, or there is coughing or palpitations along with water Qi, use Zhen Wu Tang minus Aconite with added ginger juice.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>For cold hands and feet with warm feelings in the chest, wanting to vomit but unable to, feeling frustrated and helpless, use half-dried ginger juice with pinellia decoction. For those who are weak after sweating, use dried ginger, scutellaria, and ginseng soup. If after sweating, water or grains cannot be taken, it is critical; a small pinellia decoction can relieve this. If there is warm toxin causing vomiting, along with a feeling of heaviness in the heart and skin rashes, and if there is water evidence and vomiting, first comes the vomiting and confusion. Vomiting pus and blood indicates a reversed foul odor trying to push upwards; if it is expelled completely, one can recover. </p>
<p>For dry retching, heat in the stomach combines with grain qi rising, causing a feeling of blockage in the heart, hence one vomits with nothing to expel, and cannot eat; use Huanglian Detoxifying Decoction. For dry retching without sweat in a Taiyang condition, it indicates wind-evil obstructing upwards; use Guizhi Decoction. If in a Taiyang and Yangming combined illness, there is no diarrhea but only vomiting or dry retching, it indicates blocked internal qi rising without descending; use Gegen Decoction. For cold stomach and dried fluids with dry retching and thirst, use Lizhong Decoction. </p>
<p>In a Shaoyin condition with three symptoms: dry retching, diarrhea with weak pulse, use Baitong Decoction. For internal cold and external heat with a faint pulse about to fail, use Tongmai Sijue Decoction. If diarrhea does not stop, and there is restlessness with reversed qi and no pulse, use Baitong with pig bile decoction. </p>
<p>For Jueyin headaches with dry retching and vomiting phlegm, or self-induced diarrhea, feeling cold and restless, use Sanwei Shenyu Decoction. If there is a feeling of chest tightness that seems like shortness of breath but isn’t, seems like vomiting but isn’t, or seems like hiccuping but isn’t, feeling confused and helpless, use half-dried ginger juice with pinellia decoction or small and large tangerine peel decoction.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Vomiting with Fishy and Sour Odors</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting is silent with no objects present; it occurs immediately after eating. Danxi associates this with blood disorders of the Yang, but it is the stomach that primarily governs it. Vomiting that is fishy and foul indicates cold, while sour and pungent suggests heat, necessitating treatment alongside nausea. If vomiting is accompanied by weakness and pain in the legs, it indicates foot qi issues. Weak pulse during vomiting, with beneficial urination and slight fever accompanied by cold extremities indicates extreme deficiency, which is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>There are distinct conditions of cold and hot qi in relation to food.</p>
<p>For cold in the stomach, symptoms include clear vomiting, cold extremities, and vomiting after prolonged food intake. Treatment includes Er Chen Tang (Two Efficients Decoction) with added ginger and cinnamon. In severe cases, add zingerone and aconite, or use clove and pinellia pills. For heat in the stomach, symptoms include a flushed face, hot extremities, and immediate vomiting after eating. Treatment involves Er Chen Tang with ginger and stir-fried scutellaria, lotus, and gardenia; if symptoms are severe, slightly add betel nut and aquilaria. For stomach pain, add ginger juice, or use kudzu and bamboo shavings soup, or modified tangerine peel and bamboo soup, or Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with bamboo shavings. </p>
<p>If constantly vomiting clear water with cold phlegm rising, it is due to heat in the spleen. For treatment, use Er Chen Tang with equal parts of atractylodes, white peony, cimicifuga, stir-fried scutellaria, gardenia, shen qu, barley sprouts, and dry ginger, either in pill or decoction form. </p>
<p>For cases of qi vomiting, where qi clashes cause chest pain, and immediate thirst follows vomiting, the treatment should focus on descending qi and harmonizing the middle. Use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentles Decoction) with added aquilaria, patchouli, platycodon, and loquat leaves, or use Qi Qi Tang (Seven Qi Decoction). </p>
<p>For vomiting due to middle jiao disturbance, where food accumulates and gas is involved, treatment may include pain followed by vomiting or vice versa. Use equal parts of aquilaria and betel nut, finely ground, and take it mixed. For moving qi, use Zi Chen Wan (Purple Sink Pill). For digesting accumulation, apply common Ping Wei San (Calm the Stomach Powder), or Er Chen Tang with green skin, sand seeds, white cardamom, hawthorn, and shen qu adjusted accordingly.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p>
<h3>Cold in the Lower Jiao</h3>
<p>The condition of retching in the lower jiao is due to cold. Vomiting in the morning after breakfast and vomiting in the evening after dinner will lead to clear and smooth urination and constipation for a prolonged period. This is due to the yin qi being obstructed and not harmonizing with the yang. The treatment should warm the cold and unblock the secretions, supplemented with middle jiao herbs for reconciliation. This includes formulas like Fuzi Lizhong Tang, Muxiang Yunqi San paired with Lizhong Tang, Sini Tang, Dinghu San, Guding Bantang, Yangzheng Dan, and Guban Liudan Wan.</p>
<h3>No Purging</h3>
<p>In cases of vomiting, purging is generally not advisable. Symptoms such as craving cold, feeling irritable and thirsty, and severe chest and abdominal pain with constipation indicate stagnation in the large and small intestines and bladder. For heat, Da Chaihu Tang may be used to purge, while for deficiency, a moistening treatment is recommended.</p>
<h3>Damp Phlegm Fire Water</h3>
<p>For vomiting due to excess phlegm and fire, modify Er Chen Tang by adding ginger-fried Qinghao. Alternatively, Xiaojiao Zhong Tang may serve as the principal remedy. If liver fire assaults the stomach, use Dan Huang Lian Wan or single Ren Zhongbai mixed with ginger juice for ingestion. In cases with phlegm dampness obstructing the spleen’s channels, resulting in nausea and the expulsion of clear fluids or resembling bean juice, use Weiling Tang with Banxia and Banna. If water is vomited with a feeling of discomfort in the heart, first thirsty then vomiting indicates the use of Chi Fu Ling Tang. If the vomiting occurs first then thirst develops, use Zhu Ling Tang. For immediate vomiting upon taking in water, use Wuling San.</p>
<h3>Pus, Blood, Wind, and Heat<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></h3>
<p>Foul odors from fish and meat lead to nausea and vomiting, mixed with saliva and blood. This purulent blood accumulates in the channels; hence, it is said that if a familial history of vomiting exists, and there is a gathering of pus, there is no need for treatment—the pus will resolve on its own. Use a double dose of the Four Substance Decoction with red Poria and Mu Dan Pi. If one&#39;s constitution is weak, use the Eight Treasure Decoction with Chen Pi.</p>
<p>If the wind pathogen affects the stomach, causing unsettled sensations or sour water pooling without the ability to ingest food, do not switch to Jin Zheng Qi Powder, Mai Dong Decoction, or An Pi Pills, as this may aggravate the condition. Only if there is prolonged pain in the hypochondrium, do you dare to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Qing Pi, Shao Yao, Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, Chuan Xiong, sand ginger, and Shen Qu. For treating water heat, use the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction added with Qing Dai and ginger juice, and make steamed cakes into pills.</p>
<p>For summer-related vomiting and thirst, use Huang Lian Xiang Ru San or Liu Yi San with sand ginger, or Pi Pa Ye San and Qian’s Bai Zhu San.</p>
<p>For long-term illness with weak stomach Qi, unable to take in food and vomiting at the scent of food, use Si Wei Huo Ye Decoction or Si Jun Zi Tang with the removal of Poria and the addition of Xiang Fu, Ren Shen, and Qi. For chest tightness and shortness of breath, use the Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If there is weak stomach cold phlegm leading to vomiting, increase the Ban Xia Decoction.</p>
<p>If there are worms causing frequent nausea, stomach pain, and expelling clear water, while temporarily stopping with food intake but worsening with hunger, this indicates the presence of roundworms in the stomach. Use Er Chen Decoction with Ku Lian Gen, Shi Jun Zi, Bai Zhu, and Wu Mei. Alternatively, one may use a mixture of tin ash and areca nut in equal parts, with rice drink for adjusting consumption. If there is vomiting resembling vegetable juice, it leads to death; this is sudden vomiting and is not due to the stomach turning over.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>According to ancient practitioners, vomiting belongs to the Yangming category, which is characterized by abundant qi and blood, thus accompanied by sound and material (vomit); both blood and qi are affected. Vomiting (tui) belongs to the Taiyang category, characterized by abundant blood and little qi, hence it involves material (vomit) without sound; this indicates a blood issue. Hiccuping (huè) belongs to the Shaoyang category, defined by abundant qi and limited blood, resulting in sound without material; this is indicative of a qi issue. Dongyuan states that both vomiting and hiccuping arise from a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, either from the invasion of cold or from diet-related harm, leading to upwards reversal and an inability to retain food. </p>
<p>The elder Jie Gu discusses three causes of qi accumulation due to cold: The upper jiao is located at the stomach area, communicates with celestial qi, and is responsible for receiving but not expelling; the middle jiao is at the center, connects to celestial qi above and terrestrial qi below, and governs the digestion of food; the lower jiao, beneath the navel, connects to terrestrial qi, and is responsible for expulsion rather than reception. Therefore, if vomiting occurs in the upper jiao, it is always caused by qi, which corresponds to the yang of heaven. Its pulse is superficial and strong. The symptoms often involve vomiting shortly after eating, with a thirst for water; treatment should focus on descending qi and harmonizing the center. For the middle jiao, vomiting is due to accumulation, with both yin and yang involved, where qi and food interact. Its pulse is superficial and wiry. Symptoms may involve pain preceding vomiting or vomiting preceding pain; the remedy should aim to eliminate accumulation and harmonize qi. For the lower jiao, vomiting arises from cold, corresponding to earth.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>The pulse is large and slow. The symptoms include vomiting food eaten in the morning by evening, vomiting food eaten in the evening by morning, clear and smooth urination, and difficulty in bowel movements. The treatment should focus on relieving the obstruction and warming the cold pathogen. Later generations further classified the conditions: if vomiting occurs immediately after food intake, it is called &quot;retching&quot;; if food is ejected shortly after swallowing, use a small Banxia decoction. If vomiting occurs as soon as the food is swallowed, it is termed &quot;violent vomiting,&quot; meaning that the food is expelled immediately after being swallowed; use ginger and tangerine peel decoction. If vomiting occurs after eating is completed, it is referred to as &quot;vomiting,&quot; meaning that vomiting follows the completion of eating, and the remedy is tangerine peel and Banxia decoction. If vomiting happens long after eating, it is called &quot;reflux,&quot; as food has been in the stomach long enough that the stomach cannot separate pure from turbid and expels it again; use boiled Jinhua pills. If vomiting occurs after subsequent eating, it is termed &quot;reversed stomach,&quot; meaning that food is retained after the first intake but is expelled on the second; it erupts from the stomach&#39;s outlet, use Yilao Zini pills. Vomiting breakfast by evening and dinner by morning indicates the accumulation of a day&#39;s worth of food, lasting as long as six hours before vomiting; this concerns the lower body illnesses, treated with Banxia, ginger, and rhubarb decoction. Among the above symptoms, the quicker the vomiting, the more it indicates issues in the upper body; the longer the vomiting, the more it suggests problems in the lower body. The interplay of yin and yang, deficiency and excess, makes it challenging to distinguish the true and false.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The ancient method uses Banxia (Pinellia) and Shengjiang (ginger) as the primary agents. Only Dongyuan states that ginger can stop vomiting, but it addresses a condition of obstructed Qi due to excess in the exterior. If there is deficiency in the stomach and the Qi of grain does not flow, one should merely tonify the stomach to promote the flow of grain Qi. Therefore, if Xiao Banxia Decoction does not relieve the condition, taking Da Banxia Decoction will immediately bring relief. </p>
<p>For those with cold symptoms, there is a preference for warmth and an aversion to cold, with cold limbs and a weak pulse. One may use Erling Decoction with cloves and roasted ginger, or Lichung Decoction with Zhishi. It is essential to take these medications cold, as cold intake prevents vomiting.</p>
<p>If various medicines are ineffective, Hongdou Pills have remarkable results. </p>
<p>For those with heat symptoms, there is a preference for coolness and an aversion to heat, with restlessness and a strong pulse. Use Erling Decoction with Huanglian (coptis), Zhizi (gardenia), Zhu Ru (bamboo shavings), Pi Pa Ye (loquat leaves), Ganhua (pueraria), Shengjiang (ginger), and Lu Gen (reed root juice).</p>
<p>For Qi stagnation, with distension and fullness, add Zhishi (bitter orange), Chenxiang (aloeswood), and Muxiang (saussurea) to Erling Decoction.</p>
<p>For phlegm-dampness, which occurs upon encountering cold, commonly referred to as “cold saliva,” first use Jiangsu Decoction to take down Ling Sha Dan, followed by Qi-regulating medications.</p>
<p>For food stagnation, one must promote digestion, using Zhishi, Houpu, Cangzhu, Shenqu, Maiya, Shengjie (hawthorn), and Sharen. </p>
<p>If vomiting occurs and the various medicines are ineffective, one must depend on heavy settling agents like Ling Sha Dan and Yangzheng Dan.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>When vomiting and the central qi is long deficient, one must use grains to harmonize it. It is advisable to use charred white rice, dried tangerine peel, poria cocos, pinellia, licorice, aged millet, job&#39;s tears, and glutinous rice powder, sipping on aged rice drink regularly. First induce vomiting, then purge, when the body is hot and the abdomen feels distended; this is called &quot;leaky qi.&quot; This is due to wind damage in the upper burner, with pathogenic qi lodged within, treated with Mai Men Dong decoction. If there are no bowel movements and qi is stagnant, this is termed &quot;running suckling,&quot; indicating excess heat in the lower burner, treated with ginseng decoction. For dry heaving and qi reversal, use equal parts tangerine peel and ginger. For nausea damaging the stomach, in cases of deficiency use ginseng, tangerine peel, poria, licorice, pinellia, and ginger; for excess use bitter orange peel, sand ginger, tangerine peel, pinellia, white cardamom, and patchouli. If the vomiting is bitter, the pathogen resides in the gallbladder, treated with coptis, licorice, ginger, tangerine peel, and Bupleurum. Vomiting sour is attributed to the liver; if accompanied by heat, use Zuo Jin Wan with white cardamom, ginger, bamboo shavings, and gardenia; if accompanied by cold, use Zuo Jin Wan with clove, dried ginger, white atractylodes, and agarwood. For vomiting clear water, this suggests a deficiency of qi, treated with Liu Jun Zi decoction with chi shi zhi. If expelling ascaris, the stomach is cold, treated with Li Zhong decoction adding five grains of Sichuan pepper and half an ounce of areca nut, and swallow black plum pills. Identify the causes clearly; match medicines to symptoms—do not adhere strictly to fixed patterns; only then can one respond to the endless variations.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Dry Heaving</strong></p>
<p>Dry heaving refers to the empty retching without any contents being expelled. Generally, this occurs when heat is present in the stomach along with the qi of grains, causing an upward surge of heat that results in a feeling of pressure and blockage under the heart. In cases of external deficiency where sweating leads to dry heaving, the treatment is Gui Zhi Tang, which governs spontaneous sweating. For less yin leading to diarrhea and dry heaving, the treatment is Sheng Jiang Tang, which addresses the diarrhea. If there’s spitting of saliva and foam with dry heaving associated with jueyin, the prescription is Wu Zhu Yu Tang, which governs the salivary foam. Once the pathogen departs, the vomiting will cease.</p>
<p>There are also conditions related to water qi. If the exterior of the taiyang does not resolve, resulting in water qi beneath the heart with body heat and dry heaving, slight wheezing or spontaneous diarrhea may occur, treated with Xiao Qing Long Tang. If there’s no fever but only chills, side pain, coughing with diarrhea, and dry heaving, this too is related to water qi, treated with Shi Zao Tang. For dry heaving caused by cold drinks in the diaphragm, this pertains to shaoyin, treated with Si Ni Tang.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage with heat in the stomach alongside grain qi, causing the upward surge of heat without any contents—that is termed dry heaving—and it is necessary to differentiate between excess heat and water qi for treatment, which differs from the case of hiccups. </p>
<p>After three to four days, if the pathogen transitions to the shaoyang with gallbladder involvement, resulting in chest and side pain, deafness, alternating chills and fever, bitterness in the mouth, and vomiting, feeling pulse on both yin and yang meridians reveals it is half exterior and half interior. Since the gallbladder has no pathway for discharge or intake, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang. There are three prohibitions in meridian treatment: sweating, purging, and vomiting. This is because yangming and taiyang meridians do not treat from the interior. The state of being half exterior and half interior with the yang intersecting in between is called shaoyang.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>On Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting (ou) is when both sound and substance are expelled. Expectoration (tu) is when only substance is expelled without sound. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing emphasizes &quot;gan&quot; to distinguish these, indicating that vomiting clearly involves matter. &quot;Gan&quot; signifies emptiness; thus, it is merely an empty retching without anything being expelled. However, both vomiting and expectoration involve matter being expelled; when compared, vomiting is more severe than expectoration. This is because a pathogenic influence strikes inward, causing the internal qi to rise counter to normal, hence the vomiting and the inability to retain water and food. </p>
<p>In the case of gastric heat, the pulse is wiry and rapid, and there is thirst and discomfort in the mouth; for gastric cold, the pulse is wiry and slow, there is a reversal of cold, aversion to food, and mild bowel movements; in situations where there is water qi, one feels thirst first followed by vomiting, and experiences discomfort in the diaphragm; in the presence of pus and blood, there is a fishy sensation in the throat, with a rising and surging sensation; this does not require treatment, as vomiting out the pus will lead to self-healing. These four situations must not be confused. Generally speaking, if the pathogen is partly external and partly internal, there will be more vomiting, and vomiting can also occur due to heat in the interior.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Therefore, the classics say: If there is much vomiting, even if there are signs of Yangming, it should not be forcefully treated, as the qi is counterflowing, and it has not yet recovered to be solid. If there is vomiting and a weak pulse, a smooth urination, and slight fever with signs of convulsion, it is difficult to treat due to severe deficiency and cold.</p>
<p>If one feels nauseous after eating grains, it pertains to Yangming. If the condition worsens after taking decoction, it involves the upper jiao; one may use tangerine peel decoction or Xiao Chai Hu decoction. If there are symptoms of nausea, belching, or panting, with a muddled heart region, use major tangerine peel decoction. </p>
<p>After sweating and purging, if the pulse is slow and there is vomiting, it indicates cold in the stomach, treated with Li Zhong Wan. After recovery, if there is fatigue and vomiting, use bamboo leaf and gypsum decoction with ginger juice added. If there has been repeated sweating and the food qi is obstructed, leading to immediate vomiting upon intake, use dried ginger, huang qin, huang lian, and ren shen decoction.</p>
<p>If after sweating the water decoction cannot be ingested, it is called counterflow, treated with Ban Xia and Fu Ling decoction. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; states: For all cases of vomiting where food does not go down, use Ban Xia decoction. If vomiting occurs with a slippery and rapid pulse, or if it is strong and feverish, use Mao Gen decoction.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Case Study</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>If there is deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, and vomiting with chest and diaphragm obstruction, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to strengthen the spleen and generate original qi. If there has been excessive consumption of pungent and hot medicines, leading to vomiting and obstruction in the diaphragm, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with Xiangfu and Danggui to enhance the spleen and suppress yin fire. If there is internal gastric fire preventing food intake, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Qian and Lian to clear heat and nourish the stomach. If the patient vomits food after intake, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Mu Xiang and Pao Jiang to warm the interior and strengthen the spleen. If qi-depleting medicines have been taken, leading to the absence of blood production and hard and dry stools, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with Xiangfu and Danggui to nourish the spleen and generate blood. If fire reverses and obstructs upward, preventing food intake, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with Zhi Mu and Huang Lian to clear heat and nourish the blood. If phlegm and fluids are blocking and preventing food intake, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Mu Xiang and Zhi Mu to strengthen the spleen and resolve phlegm. If there is cold in the spleen and stomach preventing food intake, or if food enters but does not digest, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Mu Xiang and Pao Jiang to warm and supplement the spleen and stomach. If one cannot avoid excessive sexual activity, indulgence in rich flavors, and fails to regulate diet, do not treat. Elderly patients with no blood should also not be treated.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Causes of Vomiting Vary</strong></p>
<p>Yang Renzhai said: It is commonly known that vomiting occurs due to disharmony in the stomach&#39;s qi. However, there are various causes such as cold in the stomach, heat in the stomach, phlegm and fluid, retention of undigested food, intrusion of wind evil into the stomach, and rebellious qi rising up. Shouldn&#39;t we investigate their origins?</p>
<p><strong>For Long-term Illness with Internal Heat, Use Spicy and Warming Herbs for Acid Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;Wood yin leads forth, fire yin brings forth.&quot; For patients with prolonged illness, the spleen and stomach are generally weak, and many belong to the category of qi stagnation. Thus, for acid vomiting, we should utilize the treatment of Dongyuan to harmonize the stomach, which is the method of using warmth for heat conditions. Some claim that Dongyuan treats acid vomiting as a cold situation, showing a lack of understanding of Dongyuan. I observe that previous scholars have argued, such as the &quot;Jufang,&quot; that using warming herbs to treat acid vomiting cannot avoid doubts about cold; this may not have rightly examined the classic&#39;s intent, which is specifically for heat conditions. Those who recognize this heat are few, with Liu Hejian being the only notable exception.</p>
<p><strong>For New Illness with Acid Vomiting, Use Cold Tastes</strong></p>
<p>Danxi said: For all cases of acid vomiting and acid swallowing, they all belong to heat. One must use Wu Zhu Yu to counter its nature and eliminate it. Stir-fried Huang Lian and stir-fried Zhi Zi are essential medicines; this is to treat the illness caused by heat inducing acidity, thus only employing cold tastes. Wu Zhu Yu must also be used to counter its heat nature. Could it be that only Danxi understands Dongyuan?<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Dong Yuan said: Vomiting and belching all pertain to the stomach, which is the chief organ, differing only in terms of the quantity of qi and blood. For example, in cases of vomiting, it relates to the Yangming channel, which has abundant blood and qi, thus resulting in both sound and substance; this indicates an illness of both qi and blood. Zhongjing stated: Even if there is much vomiting with Yangming symptoms, one must be cautious not to purge. Master Sun proclaimed that those who vomit often take fresh ginger, which is indeed the sacred remedy for vomiting. One must disperse the rebellious qi, thus using fresh ginger as the main ingredient. In cases of vomiting, it relates to the Taiyang channel, which has much blood but little qi, hence there is substance without sound; this indicates a blood illness. If food is ingested, then there will be vomiting; if food is already in the stomach, vomiting will occur, and dried tangerine peel can be used to relieve it. Belching relates to the Shaoyang channel, which has much qi and little blood, resulting in sound without substance; this indicates a qi illness, and the main remedy should be ginger combined with pinellia. Therefore, Zhu Feng suggested treating vomiting and belching with fresh ginger, pinellia, dried tangerine peel, and the like. Upon investigating the origins of these three ailments, they are all caused by weak spleen qi, or by cold invading the stomach, aggravated by dietary injuries. Hence, one should primarily use ingredients such as clove, patchouli, pinellia, poria, dried tangerine peel, and fresh ginger. If there has been pre-existing internal injury accompanied by these ailments, one should examine the deficiency and excess to resolve them internally. For phlegm and fluid accumulation, purging is essential. One must differentiate between the channels and match the appropriate remedies; disorder is not permissible.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>From the &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; text: For those who vomit undigested grain and cannot expel it, the primary treatment is Xiaobansha Decoction. It also states: For those who are prone to vomiting and originally felt thirst, but now do not, it is because there is a blockage below the heart due to fluid accumulation, which Xiaobansha Decoction addresses. The ingredients include one pound of Banxia, half a pound of fresh ginger, and seven liters of water, boiled down to one and a half liters and consumed warm in divided doses. It further states: For sudden vomiting, a sensation of fullness below the heart, fluid retention, and dizziness, the appropriate treatment is Xiaobansha Decoction plus Poria, which simply adds four taels of Poria to the previous formula. Both ginger and Banxia are effective primary agents for treating vomiting. However, for cases of obstruction in the upper burner due to excess, where the stomach is weak and the grain qi is not flowing, leading to chest blockage and vomiting, it is crucial to nourish the stomach and promote the flow of grain qi rather than using pungent herbs to drain it. Thus, if Xiaobansha Decoction does not yield results, switching to Dabanxia Decoction will provide immediate relief; this is the principle according to Zhongjing.</p>
<p>Zhongjing states: If a patient wishes to vomit, one must not force them to do so. Additionally, using Da Huang and Gan Cao to treat vomiting immediately after eating—is this acceptable? It is because the desire to vomit indicates that the illness is located above, and it can be permitted to let it act. Conversely, forcing a downward motion would surely cause stagnation and increase confusion, thus it is prohibited. If one has vomited but is unable to stop and has rising symptoms without descending ones, one should allow the downward motion to occur without haste to use Da Huang, hence it is permitted. Military strategy says: evade the sharp and strike the slow; this embodies the principle. Danxi affirmed this by stating that for any condition of vomiting, one must never forcefully purge; this is indeed correct.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The Treatise on Vomiting</p>
<p>In the case of vomiting, it is crucial to discern between true and false conditions. A true condition involves some form of pathogen; removing it leads to recovery. A false condition lacks pathogen and is entirely due to the deficiency of the stomach qi. The so-called pathogen may arise from sudden cold or heat illnesses, excessive stomach fire, reversed liver qi, phlegm or water accumulation in the chest, or exterior pathogens penetrating inward, gathering between the Shaoyang and Yangming; all lead to vomiting, which are the true pathogens of this condition.</p>
<p>The so-called false conditions may arise without any internal damage or external afflictions, yet persistently lead to vomiting; since there is no pathogen, the stomach must be deficient. These can occur with slight cold exposure, minor exertion, mild dietary indiscretion, or slight liver qi reversal, all summing up to a deficiency of the stomach. In assessing vomiting&#39;s true and false conditions, stomach qi is paramount. If the stomach is strong and the spleen is healthy, then whatever food is ingested should be properly transformed, preventing vomiting. Thus, even with significant harm from cold, heat, hunger, or fullness, the stomach should not falter. However, if there is a slight stimulus and the person cannot withstand it, it is due to a weakness in stomach qi.</p>
<p>This distinction between true and false conditions should be carefully evaluated to avoid the pitfalls of misdiagnosis. If the stomach qi is inherently deficient and there is stagnation, there exists a mix of deficiency and excess, necessitating initial purification before nourishment. If there is stagnation yet middle qi is weak and struggling, the urgency lies in addressing the deficiency first; one must prioritize restoring the original qi while also providing some purification.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>In this context, the principles of the beginning and the end are clearly established, emphasizing the importance of understanding the balance of factors. Although those who suffer from vomiting may appear to have a “fire symptom,” as detailed later, most instances of vomiting stem from coldness invading the stomach, with cold stomach conditions being prevalent. In contrast, internal heat is rare. Moreover, vomiting caused by external factors often involves significant cold evil, making the indiscriminate use of cold and cooling medicines inappropriate. If one mistakenly uses such treatments without genuine fire symptoms, those with strong stomachs might endure it, but those with weak stomachs will certainly suffer.</p>
<p>Liu Hejian noted that intense heat in the stomach leads to vomiting, an assertion that may be an exaggeration; strict adherence to this could cause considerable harm. Additionally, Sun Zhenren asserted that the foremost remedy for vomiting is ginger, a more accurate view that surpasses Hejian’s. </p>
<p>Zhong Jing stated that in cases of typhoid fever with abundant vomiting, even if there are symptoms of the yangming layer, it should not be purged. This mainly refers to typhoid fever. However, in my opinion, this applies not only to typhoid fever but to all conditions. Why? Because vomiting in mixed conditions is particularly unlike that in typhoid fever. In typhoid fever, there is still heat evil present, but if the heat is in the upper burner and not fully infiltrating the bowels, the resulting reversal means it should not be purged. In contrast, in mixed conditions, vomiting arises not only from a cold stomach but also from a deficiency of the spleen which fails to move. If both spleen and stomach are deficient, can one truly initiate a purging? Furthermore, while the pathogenic factors may not be connected between upper and lower body, the vital energy of both is indeed interdependent. This is precisely why vomiting cannot be purged; the concern is that if disease exists above and one purges below, the lower will become even weaker, and the upper will become increasingly burdened.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Deficiency Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In general, for those whose stomach is deficient and suffer from vomiting, the symptoms are varied, and one must discern accordingly. If the stomach does not feel bloated, it is not a symptom of real evil. If there is no pain in the chest and diaphragm, it is not due to counterflow of qi. If there is no internal heat or agitation, it is not a fire symptom. If there are no exterior cold or heat symptoms, it is not a superficial evil. If there is no food or heat yet one suddenly vomits, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If vomiting is inconsistent, occurring intermittently, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If food cannot settle and one vomits upon sensing food, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If there is no counterflow of qi and one feels nausea upon smelling, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If slight cold in the back or from eating and drinking leads to vomiting, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If there is sour burping or rancid belching, along with feelings of bitterness and nausea, persistent discomfort when swallowing cold, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If incorrect treatment for illness is administered, mistakenly using harsh cold remedies when there was no vomiting to begin with, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If one eats in the morning and vomits in the evening, or eats in the evening and vomits in the morning, with food entering the middle jiao and not being digested, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If food enters the lower jiao and is not digested, it indicates a lack of yang in the earth element; thus, the life gate is deficient. In all these deficiency syndromes, it is indeed necessary to tonify. However, since the stomach inherently belongs to the earth element and does not generate unless there is fire, nor can it transform without warmth, if earth is cold, it is also deficient; a deficiency in earth signifies a deficiency in fire.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said that the spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold, the earth dislikes dampness and enjoys dryness. For this reason, the &quot;Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach&quot; by Dongyuan particularly emphasizes the method of warming and tonifying, which is specifically set for the stomach qi and should not be overlooked! In Hejian, it is mentioned that vomiting arises from stomach fire, which is abundant and solid. Now, I say vomiting arises from stomach cold, which is abundant and deficient. Heat and cold, if both lose their balance, are not aligned with the principle of harmony. It is not to say that there are absolutely no cases of vomiting caused by heat; however, cases of vomiting due to heat are rare, while cases due to cold are common. Vomiting caused by a strong stomach is rare, while that caused by a weak stomach is frequent, hence the necessity for this distinction. </p>
<p>For the treatment of vomiting due to deficiency, the approach should focus on warming the stomach and tonifying the spleen, and it is appropriate to use Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang as the primary remedy.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>One may also use warming stomach drinks, such as Sheng Zhu decoction and Ren Ginger drink, or Huang Ya pills, which are particularly effective. If the stomach feels very cold, one should take Fu Zi Li Zhong Decoction, or Si Wei Hui Yang drink, or Yi Qi Dan. If there is deficiency in the yin part, resulting in water retention manifesting as phlegm and vomiting, one should use Jin Shui Liu Jun decoction; if deficiency is severe, then Li Yin decoction or Liu Wei Hui Yang drink should be considered. If there is a long-standing illness causing stomach deficiency and an inability to digest grains, one should treat it as previously mentioned. If there is mild stomach deficiency combined with phlegm, one should use Liu Jun Zi soup. In cases of poisoning accompanied by vomiting, one must ascertain the substance causing the poisoning. Those who vomit due to heat toxins should be treated with cold and bitter remedies; if the cause is cold yin toxins leading to continuous vomiting and diarrhea, one should resolve it with warming remedies. If vomiting and diarrhea have led to spleen and stomach deficiency, it is essential to provide substantial warming and nourishment. This condition involves cold toxin causing vomiting and diarrhea; the treatment is detailed later and should be reviewed.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>Evidence of Pathology</strong></p>
<p>Any instance of food stagnation in the stomach leading to vomiting must have a causative factor and supporting evidence. If due to cold stagnation, it will be accompanied by significant pain; if due to food stagnation, there will be substantial bloating; if due to reversed qi, pain and bloating will extend to the ribs; if due to fire constraint, symptoms will include restlessness, dryness, thirst, and a rapid, slippery pulse; if caused by external pathogens, there will be fever in the head and body, with a rapid and tense pulse. If vomiting occurs without concrete evidence of excess conditions or a strong pulse, one must not treat it as an excess pathology. </p>
<p>When cold pathogens invade the stomach causing vomiting, there are three presentations: Firstly, ingestion of cold or raw foods or mistakenly eating items that are cold in nature can harm the stomach qi and lead to vomiting. If cold stagnation persists, accompanied by bloating and pain, the appropriate approach is to warm the center and move the stagnation using balanced herbal formulas such as Xiao He (Harmonizing Middle) drink, Shen Xiang San, or adding ginger and cinnamon to Er Chen Tang, or using He Wei Yin. Secondly, it may also be due to cold, damp atmospheric conditions, such as rainy weather or cold, wet soil invading the stomach, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>If there are signs of cold stagnation yet symptoms of swelling or pain, it is advisable to warm the middle and disperse the cold, using medicines such as Ping Wei San, Shen Xiang San, Jia Jian Er Chen Tang, Chu Shi Tang, Ju Fang Si Qi Tang, and Da Qi Xiang Wan. </p>
<p>Firstly, this may be caused by an external invasion of wind-cold, or it could be due to cold damage or intermittent fever. When the pathogen is in the Shao Yang, and the exterior pathogen has not resolved but is gradually entering the interior, it manifests as cold and heat on the outside, and vomiting on the inside. This is a condition of being half in the exterior and half in the interior. The treatment should focus on resolving the exterior and dispersing the cold with medicines like Chai Chen Jian, Xiao Chai Hu Tang, and Zheng Chai Hu Yin. If there is slight nausea or vomiting, the pathogen is in the Shao Yang. If there is severe nausea and vomiting, this indicates a pathology in the Yang Ming, related to the stomach. One should use Er Chen Tang, or consider Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San or Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San. If there is a deficiency in the stomach accompanied by cold, the appropriate remedies would be Li Zhong Tang and Wen Wei Yin. </p>
<p>If the eating and drinking have harmed the stomach and caused vomiting, and there is retention of undigested food along with swelling and pain, it is advisable to use Da He Zhong Yin, Pai Qi Yin, or Shen Xiang San. Alternatively, you may also consider Qi Pi Wan. If the food has been digested but the vomiting persists, one should prescribe Wen Wei Yin.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>If there is vomiting due to fire in the middle burner, there must be symptoms of fire and a rapid pulse. It may be accompanied by heat thirst or restlessness, with a pulse that is surging and rapid; vomiting will be forceful, and the overall appearance will be robust. If it is determined that there is indeed a fire pathogen, then reducing the fire will stop the vomiting. If the fire is mild and combined with deficiency, one should use the external formula Huangqin decoction or Banxia Xiexin decoction. If the fire is severe, one should use Chouxin beverage or the major and minor Liangqing drink. If summer heat invades the stomach, causing great thirst and vomiting, with qi deficiency and restlessness, and the fire is not clear, one should use Bamboo leaf and Gypsum decoction. If the heat is severe and vomiting does not stop, with fire in the Yangming and headaches, one should use Baihu decoction, or Taiqing drink, or Liuyi powder. If there is summer heat causing vomiting but the fire is not intense, one should use Xiangru drink or the Five Ingredients Xiangru drink. </p>
<p>If there is phlegm and fluid retained in the chest, or cold dampness in the stomach, causing water to stagnate in the middle burner and resulting in vomiting, one should use Hewei Erchen decoction, Lingzhi and Bai Zhu Erchen decoction, or Xiao Banxia Jia Fuling decoction or Chenpi Banxia decoction, all of which can be used appropriately.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Nausea and vomiting due to reversed qi are often caused by suppressed anger that stirs liver qi, affecting the stomach with liver evil, hence the vomiting occurs. However, a strong stomach may not easily be disturbed, while a more easily disturbed stomach often signifies weakness. Therefore, for such cases, one must pay attention to the stomach qi, suggesting the use of Six Gentlemen Decoction or Regulation of the Middle Decoction. If the reversed qi has not dispersed, or if there is significant distension, one should use Erchen Decoction or a similar prescription such as Orange Peel and Pinellia Decoction; Shenxiang Powder is also good.</p>
<p>For vomiting caused by malaria and dysentery, in malaria, it results from external evil penetrating inward. Any pathogen residing in the Shaoyang, Yangming, or Taiyin can cause vomiting. When the exterior is resolved, the vomiting will stop. In the case of dysenteric vomiting, it is often due to weak and cold stomach qi. Indeed, if the exterior is not a cold evil, malaria cannot develop; if the interior is not a cold evil, dysentery cannot occur. If the illness does not understand its root, what can be treated? Discussions of two syndromes are fully recorded in relevant texts.</p>
<p>Vomiting after breakfast, after lunch, or after breakfast and into the evening should be detailed later under the topic of reversed stomach. </p>
<p>For extreme cases of vomiting or when vomit causes near death upon ingestion of congee or soup, use two taels of ginseng, one liter of water, boiled until reduced to four portions, and administer while hot, twice daily. Additionally, consuming congee made with ginseng will prevent vomiting.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Expulsion of Tapeworms</strong></p>
<p>When one expels tapeworms, it is always due to an illness causing the expulsion, not the tapeworms causing vomiting. Therefore, it is unnecessary to treat the tapeworms directly; rather, one should treat the underlying cause of the vomiting, after which the tapeworms will cease to present themselves. </p>
<p>For those who expel tapeworms due to excessive stomach heat, the internal heat is so severe that the tapeworms have nowhere to remain and thus come out. Simply cooling the heat will settle the tapeworms; for mild cases, herbal infusions to reduce the heat suffice, while for more severe conditions, the use of the &quot;Ten Thousand Responding Pills&quot; is applicable. </p>
<p>For those who expel tapeworms due to excessive stomach cold, the internal cold is too potent, preventing the tapeworms from staying inside. Warming the stomach will restore calmness to the tapeworms, and remedies like &quot;Wu Mei Pills&quot; by Zhongjing can be used. </p>
<p>If the expulsion is due to a deficiency of the stomach with no food, this indicates that the stomach storage is empty, leading the tapeworms to seek nourishment and thus come out. This is a sign of significant stomach qi deficiency; therefore, it is critical to nourish the stomach and warm the center to protect against fundamental failure, employing practices such as warming the stomach infusion, regulating the middle soup, and the &quot;Sheng Zhu Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>The aforementioned three methods indeed address the tapeworms. However, it should be noted that there are dead and live tapeworms. If dead tapeworms are expelled, one may simply treat the vomiting as previously discussed. If live tapeworms continue to emerge, one must take measures to eliminate them. Tapeworms are instinctively deterred by sour and bitter substances, so adding Wu Mei as an adjunct will help subdue them. For cases of robust heat in the stomach, one may add bitter neem root or Coptis as they are also effective. Any lingering issues will be detailed in the subsequent sections on tapeworms and their treatment.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>On Treating Vomiting Caused by Weak Stomach</strong></p>
<p>In treating vomiting due to stomach deficiency, it is crucial to carefully consider the qualities of the substances used. For those with a strong stomach, even toxic substances can be tolerated, regardless of their qualities. However, for a weak stomach, differentiation of suitable and unsuitable substances becomes essential. The more severe the stomach weakness, the more significant the relationship between substances&#39; qualities and the condition. A weak stomach is highly sensitive to unmanageable qualities. Not only can it not tolerate strong, fishy, or foul odors, but even mild fragrances and ordinary food smells can be intolerable. The same goes for those who are aware of their condition. A weak stomach is particularly sensitive to flavors; it cannot withstand extreme bitterness or poor tastes, nor can it tolerate even mild saltiness or bitterness, along with the intrinsic tastes of grains. This highlights why vomiting from stomach deficiency is so impacted by flavors. If there is any slight mismatch, it can lead to immediate vomiting upon ingestion, which offers no benefit. Therefore, in treating symptoms like vomiting due to yang deficiency, all fragrant, salty, sour, and spicy flavors should be measured with personal discretion. If anything appears unsuitable, it must not be used. Instead, one should focus on supplementing the yang; once the yang is restored, the vomiting will inevitably stop. This is the most reliable method and should not be neglected.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>I once encountered a man with the surname Shen, who was a physician by trade and worked very hard. He was nearly forty years old and due to suffering from a hernia that fell downward, he attempted to raise it using a saline solution to induce vomiting. Unaware that his stomach was weak and could not tolerate salty substances, he ended up vomiting incessantly, with both salt water and food coming up for a whole day and night. Suddenly, he passed dark blood in his stool, one or two bowls worth, and his pulse became weak and barely detectable, almost as if it would stop altogether. This was due to the vomiting harming his stomach qi and the extreme weakness of his spleen, compounded by the saline solution which caused blood to flow, preventing it from being retained in the body.</p>
<p>I instructed him to immediately use ginseng and ginger to revive the vital energy that was on the verge of collapse, hoping it might help. Suddenly, another physician arrived and said, &quot;All rejections and upward pressures are related to heat. The blood in the stool is also due to heat; can we still use ginseng and ginger? It is better to quickly drink young boy&#39;s urine; then the vomiting can be cured, and the bleeding will stop.&quot; The man believed there was reasoning in this, and upon swallowing the urine, he experienced extreme nausea and continued to vomit uncontrollably, until his life subsequently faded away.</p>
<p>Ah! Even a person with a strong stomach would feel nauseated at the mere thought of urine, let alone adding it to someone who cannot stop vomiting! It is not only pitiful for those who die this way but how resentful it is that such a practitioner dares to call himself a physician! Therefore, I write this to emphasize the importance of understanding the nature and characteristics of treatments.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>Nausea Treatment</p>
<p>Nausea is a condition characterized by a rebellious stomach, leading to discomfort and restlessness. Generally, when there is a desire to vomit, saliva will flow from the mouth, making swallowing difficult. The more one tries to swallow, the more nausea follows, often leading to vomiting. However, there are instances of nausea without actual vomiting. Although this condition is termed nausea, it fundamentally pertains to stomach issues rather than heart problems. </p>
<p>The causes of this condition can include cold, food stagnation, phlegm and fluids, foul Qi, fire pathogens, and dampness injuring the stomach, or other pathogens from maladies like cold, malaria, or dysentery affecting the stomach. To understand it better, one must discern between deficiency and excess, and between cold and heat. In cases of excess, the nausea ceases once the pathogen is removed; it comes quickly and goes quickly. In cases of deficiency, the stomach Qi must be significantly restored for recovery to occur.</p>
<p>Moreover, this condition is predominantly due to deficiency and cold, with at least eight or nine out of ten cases falling into this category. Even in cases of excess nausea, the spleen Qi is often weak and unable to properly transform food, leading to the symptoms. Therefore, in treating nausea, one must recognize the presence of both excess and deficiency, and avoid rash attacks while considering the importance of the stomach Qi.</p>
<p>For cases of deficiency and cold nausea, these are the most frequent presentations. If not acute and common, or if individuals lack sufficient vitality, it is always due to weakened stomach Qi. Therefore, treatment should primarily focus on warming and strengthening.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>If there is slight deficiency in the spleen and stomach leading to phlegm, or if one experiences sour belching and a cough with nausea, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used. If there is deficiency and cold in the spleen and stomach with phlegm stagnation causing nausea, the Jinshui Six Gentlemen Decoction is appropriate. If there is deficiency and cold in the spleen and stomach, or if the Taiyin is overly beneficial, causing abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, one can take Warm Stomach Drink, or the Lizhong Decoction or the Shengzhi Decoction. If there is deficiency and cold in the spleen and kidney, preventing movement up and down, leading to distention, vomiting, or signs of a cold with yin damage, with deep cold evil causing persistent nausea and vomiting, the Liyin Decoction or Warm Stomach Drink should be applied.</p>
<p>If the evil is real causing nausea due to a momentary stagnation affecting the stomach, if vomiting occurs, the stagnation will resolve and the nausea will naturally subside. If there is residual evil, treat it accordingly. If nausea is accompanied by excess phlegm, or if there is a cough from wind-cold, or suffering from cold or excessive drinking, leading to disharmony in the spleen and stomach, use the Erchen Decoction or the Tangerine Peel and Pinellia Decoction. If there is significant stagnation in the spleen and stomach, or if cold dampness injures the spleen leading to nausea, apply the Pingwei Powder. If the stomach is excessively cold and has much stagnation, or suffers from cold injuries, or if cold phlegm is unclear, with sour belching and distention causing nausea, use the Harmonizing Stomach Drink or the Harmonizing Stomach Erchen Decoction. If exposed to foul, turbid cold evil leads to distention and abdominal pain with nausea, use the Tiqi Pingwei Powder. If experiencing a cold or summer heat, with rampant fire causing irritability and nausea, apply the Zhongjing Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. If nausea arises from toxic Chinese herbs or other toxins, seek treatment from the relevant toxicology methods promptly.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The occurrence of sour vomiting is discussed as follows: In Hejian, it is said to be caused by heat, while in Dongyuan, it is said to be caused by cold. The principles of medicine have a certain consistency; how can there be such discrepancies? Is it possible that the reasoning can be switched based on these two opinions? Surely, one of these views must be erroneous, and I cannot refrain from voicing my stance that Dongyuan&#39;s perspective is correct while Hejian&#39;s is wrong. </p>
<p>How can this be demonstrated? The reasoning from Hejian is actually rooted in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The text states that all instances of sour vomiting, due to sudden force or pressure downwards, belong to heat. Thus, Hejian interprets all disease processes as resulting from fire, and harshly criticizes the stance that predominantly attributes this to cold. Yet, they do not recognize that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; is merely addressing conditions in relation to changes in Qi and broadly categorizing illnesses, rather than asserting that all vomiting and diarrhea are internal heat conditions.</p>
<p>If we discuss heat, how then is it also said that cold Qi attacks the intestines and stomach, causing pain and resulting in vomiting? Further, it is said that when Taiyang is revived, the heart and stomach produce cold, leading to disharmony in the chest, resulting in the expulsion of clear fluid, and causing belching. This indicates that there are cold factors involved in vomiting; can we thus classify everything as heat? Moreover, it is said that excessive cold enters the lower regions, resulting in diarrhea.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>This statement reveals that there is coldness in the discharge; could it also be heat? From this, if the text speaks of heat here and coldness there, is it not self-contradictory and not erroneous? Not understanding the principles of the &quot;Neijing,&quot; which are comprehensive and detailed, nothing is left out. Thus, there are statements about constancy and others about change, some discussing harmony and others discussing opposition. There are parts not fully covered yet complemented by other arguments, and general statements followed by specific diagnoses. This is the profound essence of the &quot;Neijing,&quot; which is not easily exhausted. Therefore, those who can observe this well should aim to grasp its origins, discern its combinations, and understand that its breadth can encompass thousands, while its succinctness must connect back to a single principle. If one can do so, they are indeed worthy of being called a discerning individual.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>If one cannot grasp its peak and details, but only knows a small part, how can one fully appreciate its wonders? Moreover, there are those who misunderstand the fundamental principles, engage in irrational talks, and misquote scriptures to support their biases, which are too numerous to mention and difficult to clarify. Due to the discussion between the two, I will include it here and request that viewers raise their discernment!</p>
<p>Regarding the argument that the acidity from Hejian is incorrect. Hejian states: Acid is the flavor of the liver&#39;s wood. When fire is strong and governs metal, it cannot balance wood; thus, the liver&#39;s wood becomes excessive, resulting in acidity. For instance, when foods are hot, they easily lead to acidity. Some say that vomiting acid is due to cold, which is a mistake. Those who mistakenly claim it is cold merely suggest that excessive consumption can harden and create stickiness or damage cold substances, causing the phenomena of belching acid. Therefore, folk medicine focuses on temperate and harmonious treatments for the spleen and stomach. </p>
<p>Little do they know that the classics say that when a person is harmed by cold, it manifests as a heat illness. Hence, any internal harm caused by cold substances could lead to an excess of yin over yang, resulting in illness due to cold, or the clash of cold and heat causing the stomach and intestines&#39; yang energy to stagnate, leading to heat. There are also cases of internal harm from cold resulting in a rebound illness of heat, where profuse sweating and heat relief may occur, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>If one has long been troubled by sourness and it does not cease, then it is inappropriate to warm it; instead, it is advisable to use cold medications to purge it, and later to adjust it with cooling medicines, leading to the resolution of heat and the harmonization of qi. All of this are the teachings of Hejian; whenever I see it, I cannot help but repeatedly marvel. Observing what is said about the pathogenesis, it stems from fire to metal, from metal to wood, and from wood to the spleen, hence the sourness. If one speaks faintly in inquiry, it could indeed turn around; under such circumstances, pointing at a deer and calling it a horse would face no reproach. It is solely because they hold steadfastly to it being heat that they cannot help but twist and turn in explanation like this. However, if I say it is cold, it is not so. Sourness fundamentally belongs to the flavor of the liver wood. Why not say that the fire is weak and cannot generate earth, thus the spleen&#39;s qi is deficient and the liver&#39;s evil burdens it, resulting in sourness? Would this not be clearer in reasoning? Why then insist on such convoluted explanations? Furthermore, as the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states, when a person is harmed by cold, it is considered a disease of heat; this refers to the injury of cold evils at the surface, leading to the fever of the three yangs, and when transmitted internally, it becomes the internal heat of yangming. Can it really be said that internal injuries from cold substances also represent disease heat? Is it plausible to think that one can resolve inner injuries from cold by sweating them out? Even for robust individuals, should they inadvertently be harmed by raw cold, lingering for a long time and accumulating into heat, this is a case of prolonged stagnation transforming into heat; could it truly be due to raw cold causing subsequent heat? Moreover, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; originally speaks of external pathogens, while Hejian improperly uses it as evidence for internal injuries, which is quite erroneous.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>This not only harms the essence of Xuanqi, but also leads future generations to use it as an excuse; what greater harm could follow? To clarify the argument of Dongyuan regarding sourness: according to &quot;Explanation,&quot; the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all sour vomiting belongs to heat, which occurs when the upper burner is invaded by external evil. The stomach qi does not accept the external evil, resulting in vomiting. Zhongjing treated this with ginger and pinellia. Discussing it in terms of mixed diseases, those who vomit sour water may suffer severely, with the sour water permeating their heart; next, they will vomit sour water, causing their upper and lower teeth to feel sour and unable to meet. Treating this with potent hot herbs will definitely reduce it.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>The sour taste represents the gathering of energy; in the west, the lung is associated with metal, which is strong. Cold water is the child of metal; the child can cause the mother to bear fruit. Thus, one should use large doses of salty, warming agents to drain the child, complemented by acrid and warming substances, to drain the lung&#39;s fullness. If the illness arises from heat attacking, this is a mistake. The essence of various illnesses is related to the heart being affected, with turbid energy not descending, resulting in a fullness in the center. Can cold medicine treat this? This is the argument of Dongyuan, which I believe is most reasonable. However, the way he articulates it can be too obscure; terms like &quot;gathering energy&quot; and &quot;the west&#39;s metal being strong, water as the child of metal&quot; may not be easily understood, and many often overlook them. Even in Danxi’s teachings, he also mentions that Dongyuan does not speak of external wind and cold but establishes the idea of gathering energy to drain the fullness of lung metal. He further argues that cold medicine cannot treat sourness, yet employs Anwei Decoction and the modified Erchen Decoction, both containing clove, while lacking methods for treating damp-heat accumulation. This does not align with the classic understanding. Upon examining Danxi&#39;s treatment methods, they utilize Zhu Lian Pill and Erchen Decoction, and also mention that it is advisable to use fried Wu Zhu Yu, aligning with its nature to properly address the issue. Therefore, yellow lily must be used as the sovereign medicine to treat it.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>The intention of Danxi is primarily about heat, which is directly contrary to Dongyuan&#39;s views. However, when using Qinnian to treat acid reflux, one must discern carefully. Therefore, I will elaborate on Dongyuan&#39;s theories. The so-called &quot;gathering of qi&quot; refers to the metal qi, or autumn qi. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Autumn qi begins above.&quot; This indicates that the gradual increase of yin must start above, as the yang qi is about to retreat. The gradual onset of cold must begin above as well, as the yang qi declines. When it is said that the metal is strong, it does not mean the fullness of lung qi; it actually refers to an excess of cold qi. The saying that the son envelops the mother implies that with cold in the upper burner, the gathering of qi becomes more intense. Thus, using warm and hot remedies to drain the son is merely a suitable way to support yang and suppress yin. If Danxi did not grasp this intention and instead criticized it, what is the reason? For instance, cloves possess a spicy and refreshing flavor without toxicity; they are most appropriate for addressing cold stagnation in the middle burner, where qi is not flowing smoothly. How could one warn against them as if they are dangerous and instill fear in future generations? Danxi only understood that cloves should not be treated harshly, yet he did not realize the roles of Huanglian and Huangqin. How could one lightly treat sour substances that are suited for such cases? Nonetheless, even though my explanation stands, I must further clarify the discussions on cold and heat, as doubts remain. Thus, I will reiterate my arguments.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>The arguments stating that sourness is due to heat must each have their explanations, right? Liu Hejian says that when food is hot, it easily becomes sour. Dai Yuanli states that if grains and meat are in a moist and hot vessel, they can easily turn sour. Others claim that when observing winemaking, if the fermentation process is cool, the wine turns sweet, but if it’s overly hot, it turns sour. Isn&#39;t it clear that sourness arises from heat? All these theories sound credible, but insisting that people do not accept them is impossible. In matters of this nature, they are often mistaken. It’s like an archer who claims to be skilled simply by not deviating from front, back, or sides. They do not realize that even such basic errors are enough to question their skill in archery. The various theories about this are very much the same. How can we know? One must examine patients by reasoning; reasoning must be based on truth. Just as the sourness of food seems to stem from heat, it appears plausible, yet when food is in a pot, if it can transform without becoming sour, it is because the heat is strong and quickly changes it without leaving anything behind. However, if placed in a vessel, it will take a long time to sour; this is due to accumulation and does not arise from heat. I have often seen water that has been cold and stagnant for a long time, which inevitably becomes sour. Is this due to heat? No, it’s due to inactivity. Furthermore, when winemaking is concerned, heat leading to sourness seems plausible. However, it is only after two or three days of fermentation, when the accumulated heat dissipates, that it becomes sour. There has never been a case where heat immediately causes sourness. Moreover, the digestive energy in humans is primarily derived from strong heat, so when food enters the stomach during meals, it can be digested in an instant; this reflects the true response of yang fire in its proper state.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>If, like a winemaker, one must wait until the end of the day for the wine to be complete, then one cannot eat again that day; how can one not feel weary in the stomach? If it must be like cold fermentation that yields no sourness and thus is said to be without heat, then the transformation of food must also take days. Is it not evident that the yang energy in the stomach would have already depleted? It is clear that the stomach&#39;s energy should be warm; it cannot endure being slightly cool. A wine vessel should remain open; it should not become damp and stagnant. Therefore, how can the transformation in a wine vessel be as swift as the energy in the stomach, and how can the strength of stomach energy be compared to the slowness of a wine vessel? This is a matter of nature and reasoning; it is not merely a matter of tenfold, and there is no need for further clarification. Moreover, the leftover food in the stomach values quick transformation. If the yang energy in the stomach does not decline and operates healthily as usual, why would there be any sourness? If the firepower is insufficient, then the transformation must be slow. Once the transformation is delayed, food accumulates and cannot move, leading to sourness and rotting; this sourness is a gradual onset of spoilage. Thus, any illnesses characterized by sour stomach discomfort are often seen when food does not move quickly, resulting in discomfort from self-consumption, and will inevitably lead to fullness, stifling, and diarrhea. Could it not be the weakness of the spleen and yang deficiency in the stomach, yet still be misinterpreted as heat? I once encountered a gentleman in the capital who suffered from this and sought treatment from me; I told him it was cold, yet he persisted in believing it was heat, adhering to the winemaking argument, unable to differentiate, and ultimately fell victim to the likes of qinlian, never coming to understand. Is this not a case of misunderstanding from earlier discussions? It is indeed lamentable! Thus, I say: it is vital for one to discern truth and reason. If one grasps false reasoning and stubbornly clings to misplaced doubts, leading to major harm, it is nothing but this sort of case.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>This may seem like valid discourse, but it must not go unexamined. There are three types of experiencing acidity: First, when there is belching with sour water like vinegar effervescing in the throat, accompanied by discomfort in the heart (chest), this is known as &quot;swallowing acid,&quot; commonly referred to as &quot;having acidity.&quot; This condition is located at the highest point of the upper abdomen, where sourness often appears, causing unease. </p>
<p>Second, it is not as close to &quot;swallowing acid.&quot; It is situated between the middle and upper parts of the stomach; often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, with everything expelled being sour, this is called &quot;vomiting acid,&quot; typically involving excessive moisture that fails to resolve.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Furthermore, regarding the secondary issues, there is fundamentally no evidence for sour vomiting or sour regurgitation; these may arise incidentally due to vomiting, whether sour or bitter, along with various intolerable flavors. All of these are caused by phlegm and fluid accumulation in the stomach and intestines, leading to foul or turbid tastes, especially below the middle burner (Zhongwan). If the movement is downward, it goes unnoticed by people; if it rises, it is difficult to endure at the throat and mouth. </p>
<p>Concerning these three conditions, those in the upper and middle burners are simply due to deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, which are unable to process properly; treatment for this must involve warming. As for those occasionally arising in the lower burner, there may be both cold and heat present, but treatment should be based on the symptoms of vomiting; once vomiting ceases, sour and bitter flavors will no longer be present.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is merely my analysis, and I cannot help but approach the matter delicately. In practical terms, those with strong stomachs have no time to dwell on sourness and bitterness; if these sensations occur, it must be because of stagnation and blockage. This should be carefully examined according to the symptoms. If there are no signs of heat or a heated pulse to rely on, and one insists on the idea of heat arising from dampness without distinguishing between strength and weakness, then solely using coldness and cooling methods has led to many errors.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For the condition of sourness in the stomach, one must discern the subtle differences between excess and deficiency, as well as the vigor of youth versus the frailty of age. In cases of excess, the symptom can be treated; in cases of deficiency, the root must be addressed. If the stomach qi is not weak and the constitution is strong, and there are occasional accumulations causing sourness due to either cold or food, one should use warming and moving remedies such as Erchen Decoction, Pingwei Powder, or Hewei Decoction to treat the symptoms. If there is slight cold in the middle qi, one should modify Erchen Decoction or use Orange Peel Decoction; in severe cases, Warm Stomach Decoction is advisable. If there is a slight deficiency of qi, use Huoxiang Anwei Powder. These are all methods to treat the symptoms.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>When the spleen and stomach are deficient in qi, especially in middle age as one becomes gradually weaker, leading to reduced food intake and occasional sour belching, it is best to gently tonify the spleen and stomach. This can be done with formulas like Lizhong Decoction, Wengui Decoction, or Shengjiang Decoction; one must definitely avoid using cooling and depleting medications. If the deficiency is in the yin aspect and the lower burner is not warm, causing water pathogens to rise and create sourness, it is most effective to use the Recipe for Nourishing Yin. </p>
<p>Danxi said: To treat sourness, one must use Wu Zhu Yu, following its nature to counter it, which is indeed a method of correction. However, it is not merely about following its nature. Its nature is warm and it is most effective in warming the middle and lower burners; its taste, being pungent and bitter, is best at overcoming the sour and heavy flavors. To call it a corrective method is an exaggeration. </p>
<p>Using Huang Lian as the sovereign herb to treat sour vomiting is indeed Danxi&#39;s method. Observing his case studies, there was a patient who had sour lumps rising from the chest straight to the throat, which was very severe. By making a strong decoction of Huang Lian and cooling it before giving it to address the sour lump, just a few drops caused it to descend. The bitter taste sinks down, so when the sourness encounters bitterness, it immediately descends. This is also a method of calming boiling water with soup.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>If a young person is strong and has some reserves, and due to alcohol consumption feels a rising acidity and distress, they may use this method without immediately harming their stomach’s energy. It could effectively help in guiding things downward; thus, using it as a temporary remedy is acceptable, though it is not a fundamental solution. However, if one&#39;s energy is slightly weak, especially in those who have internal injuries or are older and suffer from acid reflux, one must avoid recklessly using Qinyin, as it further depletes the Yang energy. While it may provide temporary relief from bitter regurgitation, it ultimately damages stomach energy, and the condition will worsen with no recourse. </p>
<p>For vomiting clear fluids, the traditional methods using Erzhong, Erchen Decoction, or Liu Junzi Decoction are all proper treatments. Yet, I have treated those suffering from water regurgitation by using the method of managing the Yin and simmering it, and the results are remarkably effective. Therefore, all three approaches should be considered for use.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>When the skin is exposed to wind and cold, it often leads to symptoms of sourness upon swallowing. This occurs because the breath (qi) enters through the nose, and through the meridians, it connects the internal organs to the back. Therefore, once cold enters the body, the yang and harmonious qi in the stomach is suppressed and unable to circulate freely, resulting in stagnation and the immediate sensation of sourness, which clearly indicates that cold evil has invaded the stomach. </p>
<p>Currently, those who spread misinformation claim that when the skin is exposed to wind and cold, internal heat becomes more agitated, and the sour taste pricks the heart—a gross misunderstanding! The development of internal heat due to stagnation must occur gradually over time, whether one day or two, leading to stagnation and then heat. However, anyone who experiences cold and sourness does so immediately; how could it turn into agitated heat so quickly? It is precisely because it is not heat that the remedy involves warming the skin and using fragrant, drying medicines, which are the appropriate treatments for cold. Yet, those who insist on interpreting this as heat forcefully rationalize it. This illustrates the notion of seeking distant truths while ignoring nearby realities; all such misconceptions belong to this category.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>The symptoms of vomiting are often attributed to a deficiency of the stomach, but they are actually caused by a deficiency of the kidneys. Regardless of whether food is ingested and immediately expelled, it reflects the decline of the kidneys. All instances of vomiting are fundamentally due to kidney deficiency. Thus, treating vomiting without addressing the kidneys fails to address the root of the illness. </p>
<p>The formula consists of three qian of ginseng, five qian each of white atracary, job’s tears, and foxnut, three grains of amomum, and five fen of wuzhuyu, to be decocted and taken. This formula appears to be a remedy for the spleen and stomach, but it is, in fact, a treatment for the kidneys. Aside from ginseng, which supports the stomach, all other ingredients enter the kidney channel and do not simply remain in the spleen. Kidney fire nourishes the spleen, allowing the spleen’s earth to generate the stomach; when the stomach qi transforms, vomiting and nausea begin to settle. This is a treatment for the stomach using kidney remedies—does anyone realize this?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in cases of severe vomiting where the tongue resembles a thorn and both eyes are red and swollen, people tend to think it is due to heat, not knowing that it is actually due to the dryness of kidney water, causing fire not to be contained and water not to moisten—resulting in immediate expulsion of food. The appropriate method is to use a decoction of Liuwei Dihuang Tang, allowing ample drinking, which will diminish the excess heat and enable food and drink to be ingested. The stomach serves as the gate of the kidneys; the fire in the stomach must depend on the water from the kidneys to moisten it. If kidney water is depleted and cannot ascend to moisten the spleen and stomach, then stomach fire will boil, surging upwards to cause red and swollen eyes and a thorn-like tongue.</p>
<p>However, this condition can be both restless and calm—at times longing for water, but when water is offered, there is reluctance to drink. Even when compelled to drink, it doesn’t bring much relief. This indicates a false heat above and true cold below. It is advisable to add fuzi and cinnamon to the Liuwei Tang, decocting it cold for consumption to address the source of the illness.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>Why is it that nowadays only Liu Wei Di Huang Tang is used? It is because of kidney cold and proper stomach heat. To warm the kidneys, one must use medicine that passes through the stomach channel; if the heat nature arises, the kidneys cannot intervene, and the stomach instead assists the evil fire, leading to an increase in the illness heat. It would be better to use Liu Wei Di Huang Tang directly aimed at the kidney palace, which, although passing through the stomach, does not cause conflict; it is like extinguishing the fire by using an indirect route, where the stomach becomes balanced without direct treatment. This is also a method of reverse treatment.</p>
<p>For a person with severe vomiting, treatment should not be delayed. The method should employ five qian of ginseng, three qian each of poria and white atractylodes, three fen of licorice, one qian of dried tangerine peel, and three grains of cardamom seeds, boiled in water for consumption. This prescription purely uses ingredients to strengthen the stomach and nourish the spleen, yet many do not understand its underlying intricacies.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>After a great purge, if the fluids are already depleted, how can one use strengthening the spleen and nourishing the stomach to counteract dryness without causing excessive harm? It is not understood that the energy of the spleen and stomach must be strong for fluids to be generated. If one simply uses moistening medicines, the spleen and stomach, which dislike dampness, will be harmed, thereby injuring their genuine energy. This is why drying medicines are used instead. Other organs may dislike dryness, but the spleen and stomach specifically dislike dampness and prefer dryness. By using ginseng and white atractylodes, one addresses what they need without the fear of excessive dryness.</p>
<p>After a great purge, if there is cold evil directly entering the kidney palace, and the water from the spleen and stomach is entirely expelled, causing extremities to become cold and abdominal pain unbearable, one must use something hot to provide slight relief; otherwise, the chill may be fatal. Therefore, use one piece of aconite, four ounces of white atractylodes, one pennyweight of cinnamon, three pennyweights of dried ginger, and three ounces of ginseng to rescue them. Once swallowed, relief will be felt; if the vomiting settles, then all will return to normal. The water of the kidneys nourishes a person; how can it counteract the heart to cause death? It is only the invasion of cold evil directly into the kidney palace that causes the kidney fire to retreat, allowing various evils to launch their attacks and disturb the heart monarch.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Therefore, it is essential to use aconite, cinnamon, and dried ginger, which are all pungent and warming substances, and to employ ginseng in abundance to stabilize changes. This ensures that the various medicines are evenly distributed, ultimately embodying the warm energy of spring, naturally dispelling cold evils and stopping the vomiting. This is the reason why this formula is both dominant and remarkable. </p>
<p>In cases of significant vomiting, it is clear that there is a deficiency of cold, and using multiple liang of ginseng is beneficial. However, vomiting should not be uniformly treated; if the condition is not urgent, it is acceptable to use less and gradually increase the dosage. If the cold is not severe and the vomiting is mild, then adding a couple of liang of ginseng might lead to an increase in fullness. </p>
<p>While significant vomiting predominantly results from cold deficiency, there are also cases of vomiting due to heat, which cannot be overlooked. In cases of heat-induced vomiting, it must be accompanied by phlegm, unlike cold vomiting, which is purely clear water. For heat vomiting, ginseng should not be used; instead, it is appropriate to drink Er Chen Tang.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>If there is severe vomiting, one must add a small amount of ginseng and mix it with warm and spicy ingredients to stop the vomiting effectively. Ginseng can be used temporarily, but it should not be taken daily. Excessive vomiting can damage the yin; therefore, using ginseng temporarily to stop the vomiting is acceptable, but if taken daily, it will surely lead to an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin, resulting in dryness in the stomach, which may cause blockage. Hence, ginseng can be used temporarily but should not be taken continuously.</p>
<p>Vomiting is a condition that arises quickly and is a minor ailment. However, if the stomach is tilted and vomits, it will inevitably harm the stomach qi, and once the stomach qi is damaged, it often leads to severe consequences. The symptoms may be caused by heat or cold; for heat-induced vomiting, one should clear the heat but must not suppress it. For cold-induced vomiting, one should dispel the cold but must not suppress it. Suppressing heat brings the heat into the spleen and flows into the large intestine, which may lead to hematochezia; suppressing cold brings the cold into the kidneys and flows into the bladder, likely resulting in urinary incontinence.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>I have now formulated two remedies: </p>
<p>The first treats heat-related vomiting, called the Clear Heat and Stop Vomiting Decoction. It consists of one tael of Poria, two qian of Ginseng, three pieces of Sand Ginger, and three qian of Huang Lian, which should be decocted in water and taken orally. This remedy clears heat and reduces fever, thus stopping the vomiting on its own. Its effectiveness lies in Poria&#39;s ability to dissipate fire&#39;s influence, gently directing the heat downwards rather than forcefully expelling it. Moreover, Ginseng supports the stomach&#39;s energy, allowing it to counteract the presence of water naturally, making it unnecessary to deliberately stop the vomiting. Adding Sand Ginger also aids in halting nausea, which is why a single dose is sufficient to stop the vomiting.</p>
<p>The second treats cold-related vomiting, called the Disperse Cold and Stop Vomiting Decoction. It contains two taels of Bai Zhu, five qian of Ginseng, one qian each of Fu Zi and Gan Jiang, and three fen of Clove, decocted in water and taken orally. This formula disperses cold while still using tonics to strengthen the spleen and support digestion. Thus, the cold cannot rise uncontrollably, and it also cannot descend freely; it must escape from the center and outwards.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>A single dose acts effectively, like a response to a sound. Stomach vomiting is due to spleen deficiency; when spleen energy fails to descend, it naturally rebounds and causes vomiting. By nourishing spleen energy, stomach energy can stabilize. Use three qian of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atracanthus, one qian each of licorice, cinnamon, medicated leaven, and pinellia, along with three seeds of cardamom, and decoct them in water for consumption. This prescription primarily consists of medicines that nourish the spleen, so why is it also suitable for treating stomach vomiting? It is because the stomach is the gateway of the spleen; the turmoil at this gateway arises from chaos within. Therefore, to ensure peace outside the gateway, one must first pacify the chaos inside. The formula exclusively uses spleen-nourishing medicines, thus the spleen energy is fully restored; what concern is there for vomiting from the stomach? Moreover, the formula includes cardamom, pinellia, and medicated leaven, all of which are effective in stopping vomiting. Is there anything that doesn’t work like a miracle? This is indeed a marvelous method that treats both the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br><strong>Method for Treating Sour Ingestion and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Ingesting sourness relates to heat; diarrhea relates to cold. It appears that heat and cold are distinctly different, and therefore treatment methods should vary. However, it is not understood that while sour ingestion is heat, it arises from the stagnation of liver qi; and while diarrhea is cold, it stems from the liver wood overcoming the spleen. If one were to treat liver stagnation with one method and nourish the spleen with another, the earth element would collapse and the wood would also deteriorate. It is better to address both issues within a single formula. </p>
<p>The formula uses Chaihu and Cheqianzi, each for one qian; Chenpi, Gancao, and Shenqu, each for five fen; Bai Shaoyao for five qian; and Fuling for three qian, prepared by decoction and taken. Both conditions will be resolved. The uniqueness of this formula lies in the efficacy of Bai Shaoyao, as it is a medicine for the liver channel and is particularly good at alleviating liver qi stagnation; when the wood is relieved, it no longer overcomes the stomach above nor the spleen below.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>In this formulation, there are also Plantago and Poria to disperse the dampness caused by water, which, when eliminated, flows out through urination. How is there any remaining water to swallow the sourness or residual fluids for diarrhea? Moreover, there are also Pinellia and Massa Medicata Fermentata to resolve phlegm and transform remnants. This is a treatment that possesses both a comprehensive and targeted effect, yet people do not fully appreciate this.</p>
<p>Regarding diseases of the liver meridian, symptoms such as fullness and distension in the flanks and sour belching and vomiting signify the stagnation of liver wood. The correct method of treatment involves using five qian of white peony, two qian of bupleurum, each one qian of stir-fried gardenia fruit, poria, aged atractylodes, pinellia, and licorice, along with five fen of massa medicata and three qian of moutan root, all decocted in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of white peony, moutan, and bupleurum, as these three herbs are specifically indicated for the liver wood, particularly white peony, which excels at pacifying the liver without harming the spleen earth. The earth is nourished, allowing the wood to become more comfortable; when the wood is relaxed, the qi is invigorated, alleviating the pain and gradually calming the vomiting.</p>

<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Theology&quot; states: The method for guiding vomit involves sitting upright, with both hands placed behind to grasp the wrists and massage the ribs, inhaling and exhaling seven times. Switching hands left and right is the same. This technique eliminates abdominal cold and removes accumulated gas from the stomach, promoting the proper flow of food and preventing vomiting. </p>
<p>Another method: Lying down, extend the legs and elevate the heels of both feet with both hands; using nasal breaths, extend for seven breaths to eliminate food-related nausea. </p>
<p>Another method: Sit up straight and stretch both legs, using both hands to grasp the feet, extending for twelve breaths to heal the stomach’s inability to tolerate food and vomiting. Press the soles of the feet with crossed hands to relieve pain, and rest the head on the knees while extending for twelve breaths to restore the stomach&#39;s ability to accept food. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states: For the method of guiding sourness, first visualize pushing back to the kidneys; at the kidney area, imagine water rising to the top of the head, dripping down to wash the heart. </p>
<p>For guidance on food-related vomiting, pay attention to the time associated with the Yin and Yang cycles, rise from bed in an empty state while dressing, stand straight, forcefully grasp both elbows with both hands, with the toes touching the ground and the heels suspended; exerting strength for the count of twenty-nine. Avoid doing this when full to prevent harming the organs.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: The Left Prime Minister of the Central Secretariat, Minister Shi, at the age of seventy, during the ninth month of the Dingmao year, suffered from internal injuries due to self-indulgence. He felt heavy in his limbs, had no appetite, was lethargic and talkative, his tongue had no taste, experienced abdominal pain, and had headaches along with nausea. A physician prescribed Tongsheng San in large doses, covered him with thick clothing, and as a result, he sweated profusely; however, the earlier symptoms did not improve but worsened instead. He consulted several doctors, but after four months, he remained unhealed. I was summoned to Yan and ordered to treat him. Upon examination, I found the six pulses to be deep, thin, and slightly string-like. He had no desire to eat, and if he did eat, he would vomit. His middle qi was not balanced, stagnating in its ascent and descent, his mouth and tongue were dry, he experienced dizziness in the head and eyes, felt tired in his limbs, and his ankles were cold; he did not wish to get out of bed. The Prime Minister had never consumed alcohol, had a naturally lean physique, and due to the internal injuries from self-indulgence, along with excessive sweating, he was severely drained of bodily fluids, causing his spleen and stomach to become even more deficient, unable to nourish the myriad channels throughout the body, leading to his condition. Without warm, sweet, and spicy medicinal ingredients, it would be impossible to nurture his qi. The classics state: &quot;The spleen needs to be eased; urgently eat something sweet to relax it.&quot; Additionally, if the spleen is insufficient, it should be supplemented with sweetness. Huangqi and Renshen, which are sweet, nourish the spleen and stabilize the center, thus are used as the main ingredients. If the body&#39;s form is insufficient, it should be warmed with qi.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>Angelica is warm and tonifies the blood, alleviating dryness. Saussurea is warm and helps to regulate the flow of qi. Fresh ginger, cardamom, and grains of paradise are hot and sweet, dispelling internal cold and regulating vital energy. Atractylodes, honey-fried licorice, and orange peel are warm and sweet-bitter, nourishing the stomach. Wheat bran relaxes the stomach and harmonizes digestion, while medicinal yeast, being hot and pungent, helps to eliminate stagnation and aid digestion. The above ingredients should be chewed and decocted in water for consumption. Vomiting stops, appetite increases, and the previous symptoms will resolve in three days. Those attending said: Although the previous symptoms have disappeared, why haven’t we had a bowel movement in nine days? I replied: The Prime Minister is older and weaker, has both sweat and urination, and suffers from insufficient spleen-stomach energy; the vital qi is deficient and fluids are not nourishing. How could one dare use cold and toxic medicines to purge him? Zhang Zhongjing said: After excessive sweating, if urination increases and stool becomes hard, one must not use the Chengqi Decoction. Even if there is internal stagnation, honey decoction should be used to guide it out. Shortly thereafter, more than twenty hardened stools were expelled, and he felt relief in his abdomen, with regulated qi flow. After taking the same medicine, he was delighted to eat, but if there were any adverse reactions, he should consume pills with orange peel and atractylodes for digestion. After a month, his illness had stabilized. The Prime Minister inquired: Since the illness is gone, what medicine should I take to prevent its recurrence? I replied: No, simply be cautious with your words, moderate your diet, and do not take medicine. Using medicine is akin to administering punishment; if the people have sinned, they are punished; if the body is ill, it is treated with medicine. To impose punishment without wrongdoing is to abuse the populace; to administer medicine without illness damages the vital qi. The military guidelines say: It is right to take medicine when needed and to relinquish it when not. The Prime Minister was pleased and agreed.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>&quot;The Effective and Reliable Formulas&quot; states: During the Zhenghe era, a man fell ill with typhoid fever, and after sweating, he felt cool. After several days, he suddenly began to vomit, and neither medicine nor food could be kept down. The doctors all administered drugs like clove, aromatic herb, and talc, but he vomited as soon as he swallowed. I said: This is precisely the residual heat remaining in the stomach after sweating; a decoction of Sun Zhao Zhu&#39;s bamboo shoots is just what is needed. I urgently treated him with the medicine, and he was immediately cured.</p>
<p>&quot;The Correct Transmission of Medicine&quot; states: In the city, a woman from the Huang family, nearing thirty, suffered from a weakness in the stomach due to improper diet after giving birth, resulting in gastrointestinal incapacity for over forty days. She felt nauseous and vomited at the very sight of grain or medicine, and thus sought my treatment. I said: If medicine cannot be ingested, how can we treat her? She insisted passionately, so I prepared a formula using: one qian each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and poria, two fen of licorice, five fen each of dried tangerine peel, aromatic herb, and sand kernel, one qian of roasted malt, one he of ten years old processed rice, and two large bowls of water. I boiled it, soaked it, smashed lower dragon gall, stirred it finely, allowed it to settle, and took one bowl of the mixture, adding ginger and jujube, and boiled it with the previous ingredients until reduced by seven parts. After cooling slightly, she took this medicine without vomiting. Additionally, I made a broth with the processed rice to give her regularly. Each day, she took the initial medicine two or three times and gradually was able to eat porridge comfortably. Later, I used this method to treat over ten people, all with good results.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>The &quot;Essential Readings from the Medical Canon&quot; states: General Bing, a high-ranking official, had long suffered from vomiting and had consulted many doctors, yet his condition did not improve. I diagnosed him and said: &quot;Your energy at the mouth is large yet soft; this indicates a lack of food energy and an excess of medicinal energy. Furthermore, you have often taken pungent remedies, which can treat surface excess but not internal deficiency; they can resolve qi obstruction but cannot strengthen weak qi.&quot; I prescribed five qians of processed Pinellia, three qians of ginseng, one liang of aged rice, five spoonfuls of honey, boiled in sweet water. After two doses, his condition improved; after ten doses, he was stable.</p>
<p>In the summer, Sun Xiaoxiang from Tunyuan ate too many melons and fruits, which led to vomiting after each meal for ten days, causing great alarm in his family, who called for me from a thousand miles away. By the time I arrived at the office, it had already been twenty days. He was languid in bed, with hands and feet as cold as ice. I said: &quot;When I press on your abdomen, there is a response, and the stomach qi is faintly present. This is simply due to your weak middle energy being additionally harmed by cold.&quot; Thus, I used red bean pills and prescribed three doses; by the next day, he was able to eat porridge. I also prescribed the Regulating Middle Decoction with added clove and sandalwood. Within ten days, his diet returned to normal.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Cases&quot; states: The mother of Shen Wenjie from the government academy consumed damp noodles, ingested sour food, and vomited without eating. She took drugs such as Qinfang and Lianhua, which increased her chills and fever, leading to dry mouth and excess saliva; when she ate winter melon, her vomiting worsened. I diagnosed her with deficiency and cold of the spleen. I quickly used salt, mugwort, and aconite to warm her navel and abdomen. I also instructed her son to breathe in her breath to restore her spirit slightly. I made pills from ginseng, atractylodes, aconite, and dried tangerine peel, about the size of millet, and advised her to take five to seven grains. The next day, I increased it to over ten grains and gradually provided her with one or two spoonfuls of decoction until she desired porridge. After administering over fifty doses of ginseng and atractylodes, she recovered.</p>
<p>Tan Shiyu would always vomit clear water when suffering from headaches, regardless of winter or summer; ginger would help stop it. I determined it was due to deficiency and cold of the middle qi, and treated it with Six Ginseng, Angelica, Astragalus, Saussurea, and roasted ginger, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>Zhao Libu Wenqing suffered from continuous vomiting, with all the vomit tasting sour. His pulse was two or three times larger than the pulse at the radial artery, so I urgently provided him with a prescription. I said: This is food stagnation rising; it should be expelled without the need for medicine. I waited until he vomited clear water without sourness, noted the inch pulse gradually diminishing, and the cubit pulse returning to normal. By the next morning, his vomiting had ceased, and by noon, all pulses were balanced again, so no medication was needed, and he was at peace.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>My mother, aged sixty-five, in the Spring of the Year of the Rabbit, in the second month, after eating, accidentally heard something displeasing from outside, leading to vomiting sour liquid, internal heat and thirst, and an inability to eat, only drinking cold water. Her pulse was large and chaotic, and her complexion was blue and red. This indicated damp heat in the stomach. When treated with medicine, she would vomit it immediately. On the third day, she vomited sour substances; on the seventh day, sour yellow water; on the eleventh day, bitter water. Her pulse became increasingly vigorous, and she continued to crave cold water. I prepared a decoction with only yellow root and had her sip it cold. By the twentieth day, I added white atractylodes and white poria; by the twenty-fifth day, I added dried tangerine peel; by the thirty-seventh day, I added angelica and roasted licorice. By the sixtieth day, she began to drink half a cup of clear water and gradually moved on to thin porridge, and she eventually recovered.</p>
<p>A woman experienced sour regurgitation and vomiting phlegm, with a complexion that was purely white. Some treated her with a combination of Er Chen, yellow root, and bitter orange peel, resulting in increased heat and thirst, along with abdominal swelling. I said: This is due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and cold is not being transmitted properly. They did not believe me and continued with heat treatment, leading to swelling of the limbs like a curse. I treated her with Liu Jun Zi decoction, adding aconite and cardamom. Her stomach&#39;s energy gradually improved, and she began eating again as the internal fire normalized. I also added Bu Zhong Yi Qi, combined with roasted ginger, cardamom, poria, and pinellia, leading to her complete recovery.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>Chen Hu&#39;s mother had long suffered from abdominal pain, characterized by chest fullness, vomiting, fainting, a red face, numb lips, dry throat, and intermittent chills and fevers, with a large and forceful pulse. Many treated her for phlegm and fire, but it would frequently recur. In the spring of the Year of the Earth Snake, the fever became very intense, and the medication exacerbated the situation. A woman named Zhu Cunmo said it was due to the cold and cooling medicines, suggesting the use of ginseng and ginger preparations. They doubted any treatment would relieve the pain, so they requested my intervention for a compromise. I diagnosed her condition as a consequence of the cold damaging the genuine Qi, resulting in internal cold and external false heat. Furthermore, the pulse was string-like and forceful with strange characteristics, indicating a deficiency in the spleen Qi, allowing the liver pulse to overpower it. The only solution was to warm and tonify the stomach. I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and boost Qi, adding pinellia, poria, evodia, and costus. After one dose, she fell into a deep sleep through the night; the forceful pulse diminished, the strange pulse disappeared, and all symptoms were relieved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Door Laws&quot; states: Ni Qing suffered from a stagnation of Qi for fourteen days, unable to swallow even a grain of rice. He started by vomiting clear water, followed by green water, then black water, and finally foul-smelling water, nearing the point of suffocation. The doctor had given up on treatment. When I examined him, I assured that he could be saved. His family was skeptical. I said, &quot;If you manage to survive this day and night, first take six doses of the Lichong Decoction to prevent him from succumbing. Come back early for a new prescription; one dose will be entirely safe.&quot; They replied, &quot;The disease has progressed to this point; not even a drop of water can enter his throat. How can he take six doses of medicine?&quot; I replied, &quot;As long as you can get something warm and sweet into his mouth, he will be pleased and will take more, so do not worry too much.&quot; His children, whether scholars or soldiers, also understood the reason behind the treatment.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>Everyone said: Since there is a wonderful prescription, why not use it immediately to see the effects? It must first be combined with reasoning, then applied; what does this mean? I replied: The &quot;Jinkui&quot; states: For patients whose breath does not improve, Xuanfu and Daizhuoshitang should be prescribed. In this case, there are two approaches for treatment: one uses black water for the stomach&#39;s fluids and foul water for the intestines. When this water is expelled, the fluids in the stomach have long since dissipated, so I do not dare to use Banxia to dry out the stomach. The other approach holds onto the remaining life force, replacing Daizhuo carefully, fearing a sudden halt. First, I must analyze and balance the principles of yin and yang; only then can Daizhuo achieve remarkable results. The deep insights of a moment can match those tested through the ages; why question further? Also, when considering Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s prescriptions, I see he uses stewed ginger instead of dried ginger, stating that dried ginger is even drier than Banxia, which is why he does not dare to use it.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>I said: What the respected person exhales is the energy of the lower abdomen; what is vomited is the water from the intestines. When the yin takes on the position of yang, and compounded by a long period without food, various parasites will surely reside in the diaphragm. Unless one uses the sharpness of dried ginger, the parasites will not move downward, and the upward energy will also not descend; the brilliance lies here; how can one remain obstinate? The disciples privately noted: when there is discourse that is grand yet not boastful, this gentleman is quite similar. Let us administer this medicine and observe its effects. After administration, I asked for more medicine. After two doses, the patient could speak, saying the internal energy was slightly connecting. But fearing it was too rushed, we decided to wait until dawn to take more; the following morning, the decision to proceed would be more prudent. By the next early hour, before the medicine could be taken, I again requested the previous physician’s opinion. All the doctors spoke in unison against it, insisting that the patient refused to take the last three doses.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>I held out a cup of the previous medicine and urged him to take it, saying: &quot;I will stand in front of many doctors and turn around; you will see results in an instant, what more is there to say?&quot; Then I used one ingredient, Xuanfu flower, to brew a decoction and mixed in two teaspoons of powdered red earth for him. As soon as he took a sip, the patient exclaimed: &quot;What a good medicine! My Qi has already turned to the Dan Tian, but I fear this medicine is hard to come by.&quot; I replied, &quot;It&#39;s easy to find.&quot; </p>
<p>The patient, for fourteen days, did not loosen his clothes. His eyes did not close for a moment and he was extremely exhausted. Attempting to remove his clothes to rest, a touch of cold air made him vomit, and the previous medicine was halted. He thought of congee and requested half a cup; he was very hungry and ended up eating two cups; shortly after, he had eaten six cups. He vomited again, leading to the cessation of the previous medicine. </p>
<p>In a fit of anger, he struck a servant and vomited again, resulting in stopping the previous medicine once more. After that, he did not vomit again, but was extremely fatigued. He took twenty doses of restorative medicine, one pound of pill medicine, and rested for two months before he could finally go out far. He later regretted not having taken the two doses of regulating medicine earlier.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>Mr. Hou&#39;s ancestor, due to overeating in the wind, suddenly vomited violently, exhausting his stomach&#39;s qi, and was subsequently summoned for a diagnosis. He described feeling slightly feverish, and the pulse at his left guan was notably strong. He stated that initially, his middle jiao felt uncomfortable, and now he felt qi rebelling towards the left. At first, he had used pear juice without effect, but now he tried sugarcane juice, which brought some relief, though he was unsure of the nature of his condition. Chang concluded: this is a symptom of empty wind. The food and drink consumed by the stomach have been entirely expelled, leaving it empty like a valley, giving rise to wind from within. Additionally, the long-stored wind in the intestines seizes the opportunity to rise, causing instability in the stomach. When wind enters the stomach, it must affect the liver (wood) on the left, leading to the rebelling qi on that side, which explains the strong and robust left pulse. The Inner Canon states: when wind is excessive within, it should be treated with sweet and cold (substances).<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>Pear juice and cane syrup are both sweet and cool substances that interact differently with the body. One is effective while the other is not, indicating that the stomach&#39;s qi is extremely deficient. The body cannot tolerate the cold nature of the pear, yet prefers the harmonizing quality of the cane syrup. Therefore, a prescription involving sweet and cool medicines was established, including ginseng, bamboo juice, wheat, and raw rehmannia, but it was decided to omit ginseng. After taking the medicine, there were gurgling sounds in the abdomen, and a small amount of yellow phlegm was vomited, which brought relief to the chest. The following morning, bowel movements were also prompt, leading to an appearance of stability. However, there was something puzzling: Although the stomach meridian was sick, the stomach pulse did not show signs of illness. Rather, the pulses in the two sides—heart, kidney, liver, and lung—occasionally presented new issues, disrupting the norm. This led to discussions revealing that the issue wasn&#39;t merely in the associated side pulses but rather that the central qi was weak and unable to reach all areas, much like a mother unable to nurse her four children, thus exhibiting signs of hunger and deprivation. The elder stated that the taste in his mouth was extremely bland, and when water reached his throat, it flowed back, refusing to go down. It was evident that the qi in the stomach was not moving properly, and stagnant water blocked the throat, preventing the swallowing of new water.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>It is advisable to urgently use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to regulate the stomach qi, allowing the central pivot to turn, and facilitating the mechanisms all around. The water qi in the throat will not reverse, and the bland taste in the mouth will also be eliminated. If there is doubt, quickly consult an expert; it is not convenient to delay here and cause misfortune. However, overly intense statements may lead to accusations of intentional alarm, prompting the summoning of two physicians. Some claim it is a stroke, while others assert it is a chill, each having differing opinions. As for the use of ginseng, they harmonize in agreement, suggesting it is a mild and easily treatable condition, thus sharing the burden together. If slightly more medicine is administered to promote sweating, resulting in dampness, they would still commend it, without considering the exhausted stomach qi, which can lead to real difficulty, ultimately causing a spillover and loss of control. Consequently, the qi rises and the spirit becomes disturbed, causing persistent belching. Again, in a stroke of luck, using a dose of Huanglian may bring it to an end, adding extreme bitterness to hasten its conclusion.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>The two physicians were caught off guard and called for Chang again, but by then the pulse had already become chaotic, boiling like soup, frequently fluctuating and pausing. The spirit was dulled and unresponsive, though the body remained strong and unmoving. In the years of life, there was a lump of stagnant darkness; as the vital energy exited, it could flow out smoothly, but upon entering, it was bound to cause coughing. Counting day and night, there were thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, leading to the same number of coughs. The two physicians, having evaded disaster, suggested to Chang that the Four Gentlemen Decoction they had discussed earlier could now be used. Alas! In matters of life and death, do we still strive for a luxurious banquet? To this, I responded: With the vital energy already expelled and not re-entering, and further hindered by the thick obstruction of ginseng and atractylodes, the prognosis was grim. The only prescription was the Reversed Cinnabar Decoction from Zhongjing, which could restore the spirit to a remarkable degree. After administering one dose, the coughing slightly decreased. A second dose, increasing the amount of cinnabar to five qian, significantly reduced the coughing. Continuously administering porridge, the spirit brightened, complexion improved, and the pulse returned to a lighter state. Over the next two days, additional doses of ginseng, poria, ophiopogon, papaya, and licorice were used to harmonize the body, leading to a complete recovery. This was perhaps because my grandfather, in his youth, was simple and unrefined, thus the resilience of pine and cypress would grow stronger with age; it was not solely due to the efficacy of medicine. Even when discussing the medicine, it was not just the ginseng&#39;s power, but the downward force of the cinnabar that propelled it.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>The &quot;Collected Works of Jingyue&quot; states: Generally, those with a cold stomach often experience vomiting, and those suffering from cold toxins must also vomit and have diarrhea. I once treated a military officer from Wu in Yandu. Upon seeing fresh mushrooms that were plump and appetizing, I asked the cook to make a soup from them, which resulted in severe vomiting and diarrhea. Local doctors were called, and they all insisted that immediate detoxification was necessary. They administered a combination of Huang Lian, black beans, Platycodon, licorice, and bitter orange, which only worsened the illness, leading to severe abdominal distension, shortness of breath, and an inability to retain any liquids. The situation became critical, and they sought my help. </p>
<p>I prescribed ginseng, white atractylodes, licorice, dry ginger, aconite, and poria among other herbs. However, he was hesitant to use them, saying: &quot;With such abdominal distension and urgent breathing, how can I dare take this medicine again?&quot; He decided to stop for a day, and his condition worsened to the point of being life-threatening. He remarked that if the medicine I suggested was going to save him, it could just as likely kill him. My fate hung on this single decision, and so, reluctantly, he swallowed it with tears.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>After one dose, the vomiting diminished; after another dose, the bloating lessened significantly. Therefore, I greatly increased the use of熟地黄 to support the deficiency caused by the diarrhea. In total, I administered over twenty doses, and the patient returned to normal. The patient then asked, &quot;I initially fell ill due to poisoning. My fellow villagers, attempting to detoxify, made the condition worse, while you, sir, treated without detoxifying and instead brought about a recovery. Why is that?&quot; I replied, &quot;Not all poisons are the same. Must one treat them only with things like Huang Lian, Gan, or Juzi?&quot; Take mushrooms, for instance; they grow only in deep pits, abandoned wells, or extremely cold and dark places, absorbing the most abundant yin energy, which makes them plump, white, and tender. Here, you have this cold-yin toxicity, and to counter it with the coldness of Huang Lian—what sense does that make? By using ginger and Fuzi, are we not combating the cold poison? By using ginseng and熟地, are we not countering the poison and replenishing vital energy? Thus, what they call detoxifying merely assists the poison; what I call not detoxifying actually serves to detoxify. The principle is quite clear, yet people cannot differentiate. Most erroneous treatments for ailments belong to this category. The patient bowed deeply, looking troubled, and sighed, &quot;If not for you, I might have become a spirit with grievances.&quot; I hope the teachings of this are preserved for future generations as a lesson.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>The young woman of the Jin family was a daughter from an official family. She was naturally willful, often suffering from pain in her chest and sides, as well as nausea, which would resolve with adjustments. Later, at the end of autumn, her previous symptoms returned, and the vomiting worsened. After two days of this illness, she became faint and unresponsive, as though on the verge of death. </p>
<p>I was called to see her and observed several doctors surrounding her. They all agreed that her condition was such that she could not tolerate any medicinal soup or herbs; anything that entered her mouth would cause her to vomit, and there was no remedy available. One doctor suggested using a decoction of Ginseng, hoping it might save her life.</p>
<p>Upon examining her, I found her pulse chaotic and rapid, with signs of restlessness and heat that were hard to articulate. It did not seem like the fire of the Yangming channel; why was it so urgent? I then asked if she wanted cold water. She nodded in response, so I gave her half a cup, and to my surprise, she did not vomit this time, though she still seemed insufficient. I then gave her another cup, and she started to feel a little calmer.</p>
<p>Consequently, I administered the Taiqing decoction, despite my reluctance, thinking that this was not an ailment of cold damage, especially given the timing at the end of autumn; how could it endure? I did not argue, and after swallowing the medicine, she fell into a deep sleep for half a day and did not vomit anymore. Subsequently, I used nourishing yin and light clearing herbs to adjust her condition, leading to her recovery. </p>
<p>In general, recurrent vomiting often belongs to cold in the stomach, but when there are also signs of fire, as in this case, it aligns with the text: all reverse Qi surging upward belongs to fire. Thus, I have used this method to treat similar cases of vomiting that exhibit strong, violent surges and a rapid pulse along with persistent heat.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>A young child from a Hu family, only three years old, due to improper diet, was treated with pediatric remedies. The medicines used were primarily for clearing fire and resolving stagnation, which further harmed the stomach&#39;s energy, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea. Additionally, further purging led to the expulsion of roundworms. Initially, only a few were expelled, but gradually the numbers increased to dozens, thin as lampwick, even forming tangled clumps as they came out, occurring continuously both day and night. The child became severely weakened and sought treatment from me. I prescribed a couple of doses of a stomach-warming decoction, but the worms continued to come out without ceasing, just as abundantly as before. Initially, I could not ascertain their origin, yet their rapid transformation was remarkably alarming, reaching such an extent.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>Then the old man earnestly said: &quot;Only this one child, his life and death depend on you! I hope you will first eliminate this parasite; if the parasite is not completely eradicated, the illness will daily worsen, and how can he survive?&quot; I did not heed his words, but instead increased the ginseng in the medicine and added aconite. After two or three doses, the vomiting gradually decreased, and the diarrhea also ceased. Once the diarrhea stopped, I used a nourishing herbal decoction and a warming stomach drink interchangeably. After more than ten days, the parasites diminished, and after a month, his appetite improved, his flesh grew, and he returned to his original state. The old man, full of sincere gratitude, then asked: &quot;The little pig&#39;s illness was indeed severe. Now, why did you not treat the parasites, nor address the vomiting and diarrhea, yet all three ailments have resolved? Could you enlighten me?&quot; I replied: &quot;What you fear is the parasite. What I fear is the stomach qi. Furthermore, every medicine that expels parasites inevitably harms the stomach qi. If the stomach qi is further harmed, not only will we be unable to expel the parasites, but his life will also be at risk. Which harm is greater? Thus, the key to preservation lies in understanding the root of the issue. As long as the spleen and stomach grow stronger day by day, the source of the parasites will be eliminated, and all three ailments can be resolved together. What need is there to treat the parasites and diarrhea so aggressively?&quot;<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>In the Wang family, a young woman had not yet reached her twenties and had always enjoyed eating melons and cold fruits. However, she frequently suffered from abdominal pain, during which she would not eat for several days. After she reached her twenties, every onset was accompanied by vomiting roundworms. Initially, the vomiting was minimal, but later it increased day by day, with each episode involving twenty or more worms, and she would refrain from eating for ten days after each occurrence. Various doctors she consulted only knew how to attack the worms, causing them to disappear temporarily, but they would soon reappear, and none of the treatments were effective.</p>
<p>Upon examining her pulse and symptoms, I discerned the cause of her condition, realizing it stemmed from her consumption of cold foods, leading to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and accumulation of dampness. This was the reason for her symptoms. Unless she warmed and nurtured her spleen and stomach to eliminate the source of dampness, simply attacking the worms would not yield any lasting benefits. Consequently, I prepared a warming pill for her, and before she finished the medication, her condition improved.</p>
<p>Later, as she recovered, the young woman indulged in her desires and continued to eat raw fruits, causing her old ailment to return. I prepared the pills again for her, and this time she was completely cured. Observing these two cases, it was evident that in the previous case of the child, it was the cool medicines that harmed the spleen, leading to the development of worms; in the later case with the woman, it was the consumption of raw fruits that harmed the stomach, also resulting in worm growth. This illustrates that internal dampness and deficiency of the spleen and stomach are indeed the reasons for the development of worms. Therefore, in all methods of treating worms, one should focus primarily on warming and nourishing the spleen and stomach, provided there are no signs of malnutrition or heat.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The conclusion of the Greater Yin pertains to abdominal distension, leading to an inability to breathe. It is characterized by frequent sighing and vomiting; when vomiting occurs, it causes a counterflow, resulting in a red face. If there is no counterflow, there is blockage between the upper and lower regions, and without this connection, the face turns black, and the skin becomes parched, leading to death. </p>
<p><em>Explanation: The Foot Greater Yin channel enters the abdomen and is associated with the spleen, hence the abdominal distension. The Hand Greater Yin channel ascends to the diaphragm and is related to the lungs, which control breathing, thus resulting in the inability to breathe. With excessive fullness, rising and descending become difficult; without breath, the flow of qi is obstructed, leading to sighing and vomiting. Vomiting causes qi to counterflow upwards, resulting in a red face. Without counterflow, there is blockage in the middle, hence the upper and lower regions do not connect. When the spleen&#39;s qi fails, it cannot regulate fluids, causing the face to turn black. When the lung&#39;s qi fails, its functions do not operate properly, leading to dry skin and hair.</em></p>
<h3>On Pain</h3>
<p>Cold qi lodges in the intestines and stomach, causing counterflow upwards, thus resulting in pain and vomiting. </p>
<p><em>Explanation: Cold qi resides in the space between the intestines and stomach, and when it rises, it causes pain and vomiting.</em></p>
<h3>On Obstruction</h3>
<p>When there is obstruction of the lung, it manifests as distress, fullness, shortness of breath, and vomiting. </p>
<p><em>Explanation: The lungs govern qi and control respiration; their channel arises from the middle jiao and follows the stomach upwards to the diaphragm in relation to the lungs, thus when obstructed, it leads to distress, fullness, shortness of breath, and vomiting.</em> </p>
<p>When there is obstruction of the spleen, there is a feeling of weakness in the limbs, coughing with vomiting of fluids, and severe blockage upwards.</p>
<p><em>Explanation: When the stomach qi cannot circulate to the four limbs, they feel weak and droop. The spleen channel ascends to the diaphragm and connects to the throat, and when qi is obstructed, it leads to coughing. When ingested fluids reach the stomach but cannot be transformed by the spleen, it results in vomiting of fluids. When lung qi cannot flow properly, it leads to severe blockage upwards.</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the Taiyin is in syncope, it leads to fullness and distension in the abdomen, difficulty in bowel movements, a lack of appetite, vomiting after eating, and inability to sleep. <strong>[Note: The channels of the foot Taiyin enter the abdomen and are associated with the spleen and stomach. Therefore, syncope leads to abdominal fullness and distension. When food and drink enter the stomach, the spleen is responsible for their transportation; if there is reversed qi in the spleen, bowel movements will be obstructed. If the spleen is unable to transport, the stomach will also be unbalanced, hence the vomiting after eating and inability to sleep.]</strong></p>
<p>When the Shaoyin is in reverse syncope, it presents as a feeling of emptiness and fullness, vomiting of transformation, and clear diarrhea; it is related to the main condition. <strong>[Note: The qi of the Shaoyin combines with the Yangming and is responsible for processing food and water. When the Shaoyin qi is in syncope, it leads to the central region being filled with emptiness, resulting in vomiting and, due to the failure of the interaction between the upward and downward fire and water, clear diarrhea occurs. &quot;Vomiting of transformation&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;transformed vomiting.&quot;]</strong></p>
<p>When the hand Taiyin is in reverse syncope, it results in fullness, cough, and excessive foamy vomiting; it is related to the main condition. <strong>[Note: Reverse syncope of the hand Taiyin indicates reversed lung qi. The lungs govern qi, resulting in fullness and cough. The inability to transport water and fluids leads to excessive foamy vomiting. This concerns diseases originating from the lung, hence the treatment should focus on the lung qi.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Taiyin condition referred to as vomiting after eating is due to an excess of substances overflowing upward, which causes vomiting. [Note: In November, when all the energies of living things are stored within, it overflows upward, hence the vomiting. The text states: The foot Taiyin uniquely receives its turbid energy; when the clear energy of Taiyin rises, it results in belching, while the overflow of turbid energy leads to vomiting.]</p>
<p>The Shaoyin condition referred to as vomiting, coughing, and wheezing occurs because the Yin energy is below and the Yang energy is above; the Yang energies rise without support, thus causing vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. [Note: The cold water of Shaoyin is below, while the heat of fire is above; if water and fire do not interact, the Yang energies rise without support.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The second type of qi corresponds to the damp earth of the moon, leading to illness from heat causing vomiting, representing internal heat accumulation. The third type of qi, when the heavenly governance is distributed and scorching heat arrives, affects the lesser yang, causing the people to suffer from coughs and vomiting. The qi from the heavens descends upon the three types, hence the governance of heaven is dispersed. The qi of the royal season also belongs to the lesser yang, explaining the arrival of scorching heat. The people experience coughs and vomiting due to the influence of wind and fire qi.</p>
<p>When the earth qi becomes stagnant, severe cases maylead to heart pain and lateral discomfort, as well as vomiting and chaotic symptoms. </p>
<p>Regarding the people&#39;s heart pain and other associated symptoms, these arise from the influence of the earth qi. The qi of the five movements resides within, receiving the dominance of heavenly governance above, while being restrained by subterranean forces below. There is no distinction between excess and deficiency; rather, all are affected by stagnation which subsequently manifests.

<p>In a year of the jueyin aspect, with the wind dominating, the people suffer from inability to eat and drink, a blocked throat, vomiting after eating, abdominal distension, and excessive belching. When they then take in air, they feel relieved as if rejuvenated, but their bodies feel heavy.<br>(Note: The jueyin aspect occurs in the year of yin and shen. Spleen-related illnesses lead to symptoms of inability to eat and vomiting; this is due to wood-dominating soil.)</p>
<p>In a year of the yangming aspect, with dryness dominating, the people suffer from a preference for vomiting, yielding bitter vomit.<br>(Note: The yangming aspect occurs in the year of zi and wu. A preference for vomiting with bitterness indicates an issue concerning the foot lesser yang.)</p>
<p>The jueyin aspect reigns over the heavens, with the wind dominating, leading to the people experiencing vomiting when they eat.<br>(Note: The jueyin aspect reigning over the heavens occurs in the year of si and hai. Vomiting after eating indicates a spleen meridian issue.)</p>
<p>In the case of the lesser yin aspect reigns over the heavens, with heat dominating, the people suffer from sneezing and vomiting.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The victory of the Jueyin leads to a feeling of nausea, and in severe cases, vomiting occurs with a blockage in the throat. The essence of feeling nauseous indicates a stomach disorder. When the Shaoyin prevails and the heat of summer arrives, there is vomiting and a sense of reversal. This reversal is due to the upward agitation of Yin energy.</p>
<p>The prominence of the Shaoyang indicates that heat invades the stomach, prompting a desire to vomit, which is often acidic and accompanied by hunger. The energy of Shaoyang connects to the Sanjiao, hence the richness of heat in the stomach results in nausea and hunger; the source of the Sanjiao emanates from the stomach region.</p>
<p>The recurrence of Jueyin involves vomiting where food cannot be ingested; it enters but quickly exits, and in severe cases affects the spleen, causing food stagnation and subsequent vomiting. The term &quot;recurrence&quot; refers to the clash of the three Yin and three Yang energies, where the prevailing energy obstructs, leading to a resurgence of symptoms. Vomiting and inability to retain food suggest that Wood excess disrupts Earth.</p>
<p>The recurrence of Taiyin manifests through increased dampness, impeding the digestion of food, resulting in silent vomiting of clear liquid; in severe cases, it affects the kidneys, leading to unrestrained discharge. The transformation occurs when energy becomes extreme; thus, the abundance of Yin dampness inhibits digestion. Vomiting occurs as dampness overpowers Yangming. The notion of silence refers to a reclusive state, where Yin and Yang are at odds. Taiyin encompasses the three Yin energies.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When yin transforms and overcomes yang, yang becomes exhausted while yin flourishes, thus producing the expectoration of clear fluids. In severe cases, it enters the kidneys, descending to combine with the cold water of winter. The kidneys open at the two yin, which is why it is called the &quot;orifice discharge.&quot; </p>
<p>In the recovery of Shao Yang, the fire energy rises internally, manifesting as oral ulcers and vomiting, with blood overflowing and leaking. The internal fire rising refers to the emergence of yin fire from within. When it arises in the upper burner, it causes oral ulcers; in the middle burner, it causes vomiting; and in the lower burner, it leads to blood overflow and leakage. </p>
<p>In the recovery of Yang Ming, the pure energy surges greatly, and in severe cases, there may be heart pain, fullness, abdominal distention, and diarrhea, along with bitter vomiting, cough, and irritability, indicating illness in the diaphragm. The resurgence of Yang Ming corresponds to the time when the original governing energy manifests, thus the great surge of pure energy. Heart pain, fullness, abdominal distention, and diarrhea are driven by fire and earth. Those with gallbladder issues often sigh and experience bitter vomiting, indicating that wood is suffering under the punishment of metal, as the bowels are also afflicted. Coughing and irritation signify illness in the diaphragm, with the energy of Yang Ming rebelling upwards. </p>

<p>All acidic vomiting and urgent pressure below belong to heat. Heat is the energy of the sovereign fire.</p>

<p>The spleen qi fails to control and hence damages the earth, resulting in an inability to restrain water. The unclear stomach qi allows pathogenic water to enter the stomach. When the stomach qi is harmed, the meridian qi does not function properly. The true organs refer to the true essences of the spleen and kidneys. When there is damage, the earth is harmed and water is released uncontrollably. The stomach governs the meridians; when water enters the stomach, the collaterals become obstructed. The five organs, responsible for storing essence, are affected. When the earth element fails to maintain its function, the bodily fluids from the five organs leak out. When water is in the stomach, it causes vomiting; when in the lungs, it causes hemorrhage.

<p>The spleen&#39;s foot Taiyin channel, when in motion, causes strong sensations at the base of the tongue, nausea after eating, stomach pain, abdominal distension, and frequent belching. When it subsequently receives qi, there is a quickened feeling similar to exhaustion, and the whole body feels heavy.<br><strong>[Note: The motion causes a sickness that affects the channels, which in turn impacts the organs, leading to symptoms such as strong sensations at the tongue base, nausea after eating, stomach pain, and abdominal distension.

<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Bitter flavors travel to the bones; excessive consumption leads to vomiting. Why is this?&quot; Shao Yu replied: &quot;Bitterness enters the stomach, overpowering the essence of the grains. When bitterness reaches the lower abdomen, the pathways of the three jiao are blocked, thus causing vomiting. Teeth are the endpoints of the bones; hence, bitterness travels to the bones, and once it enters, it may resurface, revealing its pathway to the bones.&quot; </p>
<p>Notes: Ren Gu An said: &quot;Bitterness that rises causes suffering; it is the sovereign taste, overpowering the essence of all grains. Bitterness has downward-moving properties, hence it enters the lower abdomen. The three jiao represent the lesser yang&#39;s fire. Bitterness has cold properties, thus blocking the pathways of the three jiao. When the three jiao are obstructed, the food and fluids in the stomach cannot be properly regulated, resulting in vomiting. The kidneys govern the bones, and as a cold-water organ, they connect with bitterness&#39;s cold nature, traveling to the bones in a related manner. However, bitterness is also a fire taste, which accounts for its movement downward and subsequent rise, due to its property of downward drainage combined with upward surging.&quot;<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<pre><code>        Pulse Diagnosis
</code></pre>
<p>If there is a pulse in the upper body and none in the lower, the person must vomit; failure to do so will result in death. If there is no pulse in the upper body but a pulse in the lower, although the person may feel fatigued, it does not pose a serious threat. This can be likened to a person holding a ruler and a tree having roots; even if the branches and leaves are withered, the roots will still nourish themselves. A pulse has its roots, and a person has their vital energy; thus, it is known they will not die. </p>
<p>For instance, if one obtains an indication of the heart pulse, the external symptoms may include a flushed face, dry mouth, and laughter; the internal symptoms show movement in the area above the navel, firm to the touch and painful; the illness is marked by anxiety of the heart, heart pain, heat in the palms, and restlessness. If these conditions are present, it indicates heart involvement; if not, it does not. </p>

If someone has vomiting and pus or abscesses, they should not treat the vomiting; once the pus is resolved, they will recover naturally. </p>
<p>If nausea occurs before thirst, it is a sign of wanting relief. If thirst occurs before nausea, it indicates that fluids are stagnating in the heart area, categorized as fluid retention.

<p>A question arises: if a patient has a rapid pulse, which indicates heat, one would expect to dispel food and encourage eating; why then do they vomit? The teacher replies: This is to induce sweating, allowing yang to slightly counteract, causing a deficiency in the qi. The rapid pulse indicates guest heat that cannot digest food, resulting from a cold and weakened stomach. A wiry pulse suggests deficiency. When stomach qi is exhausted, one might vomit the morning meal in the evening, leading to a condition called stomach reversal. If cold is present above, and the doctor attempts to treat it below, the pulse might end up being wiry, hence the term deficiency.</p>
<p>If the pulse at the inch position is weak and rapid, the weakness implies a lack of qi; without qi, the spirit is deficient; if the spirit is deficient, blood is insufficient; if blood is insufficient, the chest is cold. </p>
<p>If the pulse at the Fuyang position is floating and weak, it indicates deficiency, which points to spleen issues; if the spleen is injured, digestion will be impaired.

If after vomiting there is a strong thirst for water and a craving to drink, the clam soup should be used. In cases of dry heaving and reverse vomiting, with the expulsion of saliva and foam, the mixture of pinellia and dried ginger is appropriate. When a patient feels a sensation of something like wheezing or vomiting without actually doing so, or a sense of unease in the chest, ginger and pinellia soup should be employed. For dry vomiting and discomfort in the hands and feet, the orange peel soup is indicated. For regurgitation, the orange peel and bamboo leaf mixture should be used.</p>
<p>Regarding the expulsion of roundworms:</p>
<p>If roundworm spasms occur, one should expel the worm while ensuring the patient is calm; if they become restless again later, it indicates cold in the organs, and the worm rises to the diaphragm, hence the restlessness, with intermittent vomiting after eating. If they are still restless and can smell food, they should expel the worm themselves. The illness caused by roundworms leads to salivation and heart pain, occurring intermittently; if the poison does not cease, a mixture of licorice powder and honey should be used.</p>
<p>On the study of organ disharmony:</p>
<p>When there is gurgling in the intestines, cold feet and hands, inability to keep food in the stomach, unremitting vomiting, emaciation of the skin and fur, wrinkling of the muscles, blockage in the ears and eyes, a fragmented voice, gasping during movement, and a lack of spirit, this indicates deficiency in the five organs. To diagnose the pulse, lift the fingers gently, press to feel delicately, and observe in which part the signs appear to determine the organ&#39;s condition. If the liver pulse is exceedingly slow, it leads to nausea and regurgitation.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Pulse for Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>In the pulse at the right hand&#39;s inch point, if the Yin is full, this corresponds to the hand Taiyin channel. The patient suffers from lung distension, sweating like dew, upper respiratory difficulties, and a sensation of obstruction in the throat, akin to wanting to vomit.  </p>
<p>For the pulse at the left hand&#39;s guan position, if both Yin and Yang are full, this indicates that both the foot Jueyin and Shaoyang channels are also full. The patient suffers from stomach distension and reversed vomiting, with food not digesting.  </p>
<p>If the pulse at the right hand&#39;s guan position is Yin deficient, this corresponds to the foot Taiyin channel. The patient suffers from diarrhea, abdominal fullness with upward Qi, cholera-like vomiting, jaundice, agitation, inability to lie down, and borborygmi.  </p>
<p>If the pulse at the inch point is thin, accompanied by fever and vomiting, administering Huangqin Longdan Decoction is advisable. If vomiting does not cease, it is appropriate to use Tangerine Peel and Platycodon Decoction, along with moxibustion at Zhongfu point.  </p>
<p>If the guan pulse is slippery, indicating heat in the stomach, it is considered that the heat is full; due to fullness of Qi, the patient has no desire to eat, and if food is ingested, it leads to vomiting. In such cases, administering Ziwan Decoction to purge it, or Dapingwei pill, or applying needles to the stomach channel to drain is recommended.  </p>
<p>For a floating and large guan pulse, it suggests wind in the stomach, indicated by opening the mouth and raising the shoulders, with a sense of dullness in the heart, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If the pulse feels tight and slippery, it is attributed to the movement of roundworms.  </p>
<p>For febrile diseases lasting four to five days, with headaches, abdominal pain, and vomiting, if the pulse is strong and thin, death occurs on the twelfth day. A rapid pulse at the inch point indicates vomiting.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<p>The pulse at the guan location is slightly floating, with accumulated heat in the stomach causing vomiting of roundworms and a forgetful heart.<br><strong>Pulse Canon</strong> [Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe]</p>
<p><strong>Pulse for Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>The Song of Pulses states: Yang pulses indicate vomiting along with headaches.<br>The Spleen Pulse Song states: All three regions are slack, indicating heat in the spleen; foul breath and stomach churn lead to prolonged vomiting and reversal. If there is tightness, spleen pain will also occur, accompanied by muscle tension. The urge to vomit may be present but is not fulfilled; the feeling of urgency remains unresolved. Many illnesses stem from cold; check carefully under the fingers for slow and prolonged pulses. Vomiting and reversal can be irregular for several days; how long will the stomach energy troubled by the heart last? Slippery pulses are found primarily in the cun position, leading to frequent vomiting and reversal.<br>The Miscellaneous Diseases Life and Death Song states: Internal fullness leads to abdominal bloating and pain, with strong pressure below the heart and frequent dry heaving. Hands and feet feel hot, with fine and deep pulsations; frequent urination and difficulty may lead to death. External fullness connected to internal heat leads to vomiting; clearing the stomach is hard and uneasy. Suddenly diagnosing a large, strong pulse means do not expend efforts—healing will not occur.<br>Generally, tightness is felt in the pulses of the cun and guan positions, resembling a needle, indicating increased vomiting. This illness from toxic agents requires urgent rescue; hasten to seek divine medicine for life’s urgency.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Vomiting Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>In cases of spleen disease, the complexion is yellow, the body appears blue, urination is abnormal, there is direct staring, lips are retracted, nails are bluish, there is regurgitation of food, heaviness in the body with joint pain, limbs are immobile. The pulse should be floating, large, and slow, but if it is instead tight and rapid, and the complexion is yellow but appears blue, this signifies the wood overcoming the earth, indicating a major reversal, which is ten times fatal and untreatable. For minor yin disease, if food is ingested and immediately vomited, with a feeling of irritation in the heart but unable to vomit again, it is advisable to induce vomiting. If there is retained food in the upper abdomen, it is also advisable to vomit.  </p>
<p>In cases of heart disease with restlessness, minimal energy, great heat, heat rising to the heart, vomiting, coughing, wild speech, sweating profusely like beads, and coldness in the body, the pulse should be floating, but instead it is deep, slippery, and the complexion should be red but appears black. This signifies the water overcoming the fire, indicating a major reversal, which is ten times fatal and untreatable.  </p>
<p>In cases where the lower jiao feels like a drain, if there is fullness, there will be no smooth passage of urine or bowel movements, reversed qi continues, and vomiting is uncontrollable, hence termed &quot;running feeding.&quot; In cases of jaundice, if it occurs in the yin region, the person will definitely vomit; if it occurs in the yang region, the person will feel cold with slight fever.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person suffers from alcoholic jaundice, and there is no fever, with clear speech, a full abdomen, and a desire to vomit, they should be induced to vomit using a decoction of seven herbs, including bitter gentian. In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there is usually difficulty in urination; the signs include heat in the chest and heat in the feet.</p>
<p>For those who vomit, the pulse resembles that of someone just rising from bed: it is tight in the yang, while the yin is rapid; such a person will vomit immediately after eating. A floating and rapid pulse also indicates vomiting. If at the cun pulse (thumb pulse) it is tight and hollow, the tightness indicates cold, while the hollow indicates deficiency. Cold and deficiency counteract each other, leading to the pulse becoming slow and weak, which can result in choking. If the pulse at the guan (wrist pulse) is rapid, the person will vomit. If the pulse at the foot yang is weak and slow, this indicates diarrhea; slow suggests downward force, while weak suggests vomiting, making it difficult for food to enter. If the foot yang pulse is floating, it signifies deficiency of stomach qi and cold above, with anxiety below. When these two forces compete, the person will vomit and be unable to eat, feeling as terrified as if facing death; relief is found when they feel relaxed.</p>
<p>If someone vomits and the pulse is weak, urination becomes more beneficial, and there is slight body heat; this condition is hard to treat. When taking herbal decoctions that cause vomiting, start with three taels of licorice boiled in three sheng of water, yielding two sheng for consumption; this should cause vomiting. If this does not induce vomiting, it is even better. Once the body settles down, consume the remaining decoction, which will ensure proper flow without further vomiting. For those who tend to vomit, eating plenty of fresh ginger is a holy remedy.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Vomiting Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>After three or four days of typhoid, if there is pain in the chest and sides, or deafness, or bitterness in the mouth with dryness of the tongue, or alternating cold and heat with vomiting, and the pulse is tight, this indicates an illness in the Lesser Yang Gallbladder Meridian. If the Taiyang illness does not resolve and shifts to Lesser Yang, with fullness and tightness underneath the ribs, dry heaving preventing eating, and alternating cold and heat, it is too early to induce vomiting or purging; if the pulse is tight, the treatment is Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. The pulse is thin and tight, with headaches and fever, belonging to Lesser Yang. When Lesser Yang is affected, symptoms include bitterness in the mouth, dryness in the throat, and dizziness; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated to release the exterior, but sweating should not be induced, as it leads to a confused state. A confused state pertains to the stomach; when the stomach is harmonized, recovery occurs; if not harmonized, there will be restlessness; hence, Tiaogai Chengqi Decoction is appropriate, involving both Lesser Yang and Yangming. </p>
<p>For vomiting, purging should not be applied. Zhang Jing states: “Although there are Yangming symptoms with much vomiting, purging should not be done.” In Yangming illness, hardness and fullness appear below the ribs, with no bowel movement yet vomiting, and a white coating on the tongue signifies the use of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. When the upper jiao (region) is unobstructed, fluids can descend, the stomach qi harmonizes, and profuse sweating occurs, allowing for relief. </p>
<p>Without Yang, there is collapse; without Yin, there is vomiting. Vomiting pertains to the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian, as the downward flow of Foot Yangming Qi is now reversed and ascends, leading to counterflow Qi, which causes vomiting. Zhang Jing states: “Though there is much vomiting and no bowel movement, purging should not be applied; one may use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. When the upper jiao is unobstructed, fluids can descend, the stomach qi harmonizes, and sweat will abundantly emerge, leading to resolution.”<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, the causes of vomiting vary, and each has its own treatment method. However, Xiao Chai Hu Tang is particularly important here. For those with fullness in the chest and sides accompanied by vomiting, and who experience tidal fever in the afternoon, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with the addition of Mangxiao. If vomiting persists, with an urgent sensation beneath the heart and mild irritability, then Da Chai Hu Tang should be used. For constipation, add Dahuang to the formula. Da Chai Hu is especially effective for vomiting due to the presence of Zhishi. Zhishi eliminates filth and suppresses excess qi. It must be noted to remove Dahuang. Zhongjing states: Even with much vomiting and signs of Yangming, caution is necessary not to purge. Guanjuguo Jiegeng Tang is also quite effective and uses Zhishi. Ancient practitioners often treated vomiting with Banxia and fresh ginger. Master Sun says: Fresh ginger is the sacred medicine for vomiting. Zhongjing always uses it to treat vomiting. When Taiyang and Yangming are combined in illness, purging and diuresis are common; if only vomiting occurs, use Gegen Jia Banxia Shengjiang Tang. For those with heat in the chest, evil qi in the stomach, and abdominal pain with a desire to vomit, Huanglian Tang is indicated. When Taiyang and Shaoyang combine to cause diarrhea, if vomiting occurs, Huangqin Jia Banxia Shengjiang Tang should be used. In the &quot;Jinkui&quot;: For those who vomit and cannot expel food, options include Xiaobanxia Tang, Xiaobanxia Jia Fuling Tang, or Xiaobanxia Jia Jupi Tang. For vomiting accompanied by fever, Xiao Chai Hu Tang is indicated. For vomiting with thirst, Zhuling Tang should be used. If vomiting occurs before thirst, this indicates a desire to relieve; promptly provide water. If thirst occurs before vomiting, this indicates stagnant water beneath the heart, which is a symptom of fluid retention.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhongjing said: If someone has thirst and vomits after drinking water, it is due to the inappropriate use of Chaihu; one should treat the water in the diaphragm with Chifu Ling Decoction. If there is vomiting with Shaoyin syndrome, use Zhenwu Decoction minus Fuzi and add fresh ginger. If there is sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea followed by restlessness and inability to sleep, and they also vomit, use Zhizhi and Fresh Ginger Decoction. For those who vomit after the resolution of a febrile disease, there is residual heat in the stomach; use Bamboo Leaf Decoction with fresh ginger. </p>
<p>Generally, for vomiting, food does not go down. Dry vomiting, known today as retching, may occur due to sweating, water, or diarrhea, with heat in the spleen and stomach causing dry vomiting; the best treatment is Gancao Decoction. Zhongjing&#39;s treatment methods: if sweating occurs and there is dry vomiting, it is a Gui Zhi condition. If the exterior is unresolved, and there is water qi beneath the heart, resulting in dry vomiting and fever, it signifies Xiao Qinglong. If the body feels cool, sweating occurs, and there is pain in the sides or dry vomiting, it indicates Shizao Decoction. If there is Shaoyin diarrhea with a weak pulse, and Bai Tong Decoction causes continued diarrhea, with fainting and a reverse pulse along with dry vomiting and distress, use Bai Tong Decoction with pig bile. In cases of Shaoyin diarrhea, with internal cold and external heat, a faint pulse nearly absent or dry vomiting, use Tong Mai Si Wu Decoction. For dry vomiting with foamy saliva and headache, use Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. </p>
<p>According to the Treatise on Febrile Diseases, if one desires to vomit after eating grains, it is due to Yangming; Wu Zhu Yu Decoction should be used. If using the decoction exacerbates the condition, it relates to the upper jiao. Zhongjing does not have a treatment method for this.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>A person receives life from the central essence of Heaven and Earth, and the stomach is the primary organ in this process. The stomach receives food and drink, while the spleen governs transformation and transportation, producing blood and qi to regulate the entire body. If the spleen and stomach are unharmed, there will be no issue of vomiting. However, if there are disturbances such as improper diet—be it hot or cold, excessive consumption of raw or fatty foods, or exposure to dampness and wind—this can upset the stomach. Once the stomach is affected, spleen qi stagnates, causing a mix of clear and turbid substances, leading to blockages in the middle jiao and resulting in vomiting. This primarily addresses the issues arising from dietary excess and the effects of cold, wind, and dampness. Additionally, emotional distress can also harm the body, and if there is residual cold in the stomach, phlegm may accumulate, or evil heat may invade the stomach, causing blood stasis, all of which can lead to vomiting. One should assess these conditions carefully when faced with illness.</p>
<p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>All sour vomit, rapid forced downward expulsion, falls under the category of heat. It flows without spoiling and moves without decay, hence the vomiting. Sour vomit occurs when there is significant heat in the stomach cavity, leading to qi stagnation; undigested substances become sour. Sourness corresponds to the flavor of the liver wood. Some claim sour vomiting indicates cold, which is a misconception. When heat is significant in the stomach cavity, it leads to vomiting, reflecting the ascent of fire energy. Sourness relates to the flavor of liver wood. Excessive fire can overpower metal, inhibiting the balance of wood, which leads the liver to become excessive and thus sour. Eating hot foods can easily lead to sourness as well. Those who interpret sour vomiting as a cold condition are mistaken.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as the taste of wine is bitter and its nature is warming, it can nourish the heart&#39;s fire. Therefore, consuming it makes one’s complexion red, breath coarse, pulse strong and rapid, speech slurred and rambling, singing alternating between sadness and laughter, with emotions like madness, recklessness, forgetfulness, thirst, and vomiting—these are all signs of heat. The vomit is sure to be sour, indicating clear heat. Moreover, when there is heat, all five flavors are rich. The classics state: &quot;On the earth, transformation occurs, giving rise to the five flavors, all belonging to the earth.&quot; Yet when earth is strong and victorious over water, it cannot control fire, thus fire grows excessively. Therefore, when the five flavors are heated and the food is rich, the flavors are also dense. Hence, when there is liver heat, the mouth feels sour; when there is heart heat, the mouth feels bitter; when there is spleen heat, the mouth feels sweet; when there is lung heat, the mouth feels pungent; when there is kidney heat, the mouth feels salty. If the mouth is bland, this indicates stomach heat. The stomach belongs to the earth, which is the mother of all things, making the stomach the foundation of the body, with blandness being the basis of the five flavors. Thus, is sour vomit not attributable to coldness? Those who incorrectly argue it results from cold merely claim it is due to excessive damage causing hard, sticky, slippery effects, or the damaging of cold substances, resulting in a preference for vinegary, sour ingestion. Therefore, popular medicine tends to focus on moderately warming the spleen and stomach. How could they know that the classics say when one is harmed by cold, it results in illness of heat?<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<p>Whenever there is internal injury from cold substances, it could either be that Yin exceeds Yang, causing a cold disease, or that cold and heat combat each other, leading to stagnant Yang energy in the intestines and stomach, resulting in heat.

<p>Vomiting foul substances occurs when the stomach and intestines are cold, resulting in improper transformation and transmission. If one can control the malevolent forces, one must also strengthen oneself. Hence, the cold overcomes fire, leading to a predominance of metal and resulting in foul vomiting.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of Clarity</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Vomiting</strong>  </p>
<p>How can we elucidate the vomiting of febrile diseases? Vomiting, referred to as &quot;ou&quot; in sound, is commonly called &quot;chuo.&quot; To vomit means to expel substances, which is why there is dry retching but no dry vomiting. Thus, regarding vomiting, we say that one feels a desire to vomit after consuming grains, and when vomiting occurs, it indicates that food and drink are immediately expelled, hence we can discern the severity of vomiting.<br>In cases of febrile illnesses, vomiting can be attributed to heat or cold; however, scholars of vomiting all assert it&#39;s due to Yang deficiency. The classics state: &quot;In Yin disease, there is abdominal fullness and vomiting, inability to eat, with much benefit in self-care, occasionally the abdomen causes pain.&quot; It also states: &quot;There is internal cold in the stomach, hence the vomiting.&quot; However, the theorists on vomiting disagree. Vomiting can be caused by heat or cold, retained drink, or the presence of pus in the stomach; all must be clearly distinguished.<br>Vomiting accompanied by fever signifies a condition where Chai Hu decoction is indicated, especially with persistent vomiting, anxiety beneath the heart, and mild irritation; thus, Da Chai Hu decoction is prescribed for those whose vomiting arises from evil heat. If there is cold drink obstructing the diaphragm causing dry retching, it should not be expelled but warmed; if the dry retching involves saliva and headaches, Wu Zhu Yu decoction is indicated, indicating that cold evil causes vomiting.<br>If one first vomits and then feels thirst, this indicates a desire for relief; if one first feels thirst and then vomits, it indicates water stagnation below the heart—this belongs to the theorists on retained drink, hence this is the type of vomiting due to retained drinks.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is vomiting due to the presence of pus in the stomach, it does not need to be treated; the pus will resolve itself. This vomiting is caused by the accumulation of pus in the stomach. Such cases, while they may differ, generally arise when the exterior evil of a cold disease tries to penetrate inward. If the internal energy rebels against this, vomiting results. Therefore, in cases where there is a combination of exterior and interior symptoms, vomiting is common.</p>
<p>In a cold disease, after three days, the yang aspect is exhausted and the yin becomes susceptible to evil. If a person can eat without vomiting, it indicates that the yin is not affected by the evil. Thus, when the evil energy penetrates inward, vomiting is bound to occur. </p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms associated with the decoction of dried ginger and aconite, if there is no vomiting and no thirst, it indicates that there is no heat in the interior. The symptoms of the Ten Dates Decoction indicate dry vomiting and shortness of breath, with sweating but no aversion to cold; this shows that the exterior has resolved while the interior has not been harmonized. From this perspective, the cause of vomiting can clearly be attributed to heat in the interior.</p>
<p>In cases of vomiting, if the energy is rebellious, it must be dispersed; if phlegm and fluids are involved, they must be eliminated. The &quot;Essentials of the Thousand Gold&quot; states that those with vomiting often take fresh ginger, which is considered a holy medicine for this condition as it helps disperse the rebellious energy. The &quot;Classic of the Golden Chamber&quot; mentions that for those who vomit, banxia (Pinellia) is used to eliminate water; when the fluid is removed, the vomiting stops, indicating the need to expel phlegm and fluids.</p>
<p>Even with abundant symptoms suggesting yangming (the Yangming channel), it is inappropriate to attack them, as the rebellious energy is causing accumulation. If vomiting is present along with a weak pulse, frequent urination, and mild fever with signs of apprehension, these conditions become difficult to treat, indicating severe deficiency and cold. </p>
<p>Therefore, practitioners must carefully assess the nature of the evil energy, whether it is deficient or excessive, and the reversal or orderly nature of the disease symptoms to properly apply medicine and aim for a cure.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Vomiting</h3>
<p>Regarding vomiting, is there a differentiation in the channels involved? The answer is: the stomach governs comprehensively and has distinctions among the three channels of Taiyang, Yangming, and Shaoyang, based on the abundance or deficiency of Qi and blood, which affects the characteristics of sound and matter. Vomiting belongs to Taiyang, where there is matter but no sound, indicating a blood disease. If food enters, it leads to vomiting; if food is already present, it results in vomiting; if the duration is long, it continues to induce vomiting. Vomiting belongs to Yangming, characterized by both matter and sound, where Qi and blood are both affected. Zhang Zhongjing states: even if vomiting is frequent with Yangming evidence, one must not purge. Hiccups belong to Shaoyang, characterized by sound but no matter, indicating a Qi disease.</p>
<h3>On Vomiting</h3>
<p>In general, when there is sound and matter, it is called vomiting; when there is sound but no matter, it is called hiccuping. If there is heat in the stomach and phlegm in the diaphragm, the prescription is Er Chen Tang with stir-fried Gardenia, Huanglian, and fresh ginger. For those with chronic vomiting due to stomach deficiency and inability to digest food, use Ren Shen, fresh ginger, Huangqi, Baizhu, and Xiangfu. Generally, vomiting is chiefly governed by Banxia, Chenpi, and fresh ginger. Liu Hejian states that vomiting is due to rising fire qi; this is only one aspect. If there is phlegm in the middle jiao preventing food from descending, if there is Qi counterflow, if cold energy is stagnating at the stomach, if food is stagnating in the heart and lungs, leading to new food being expelled, or if there is both fire and phlegm in the stomach causing vomiting. For vomiting medications, avoid (cabbage) seed, apricot kernels, peach kernels, radish seeds, and Gardenia, as they all promote vomiting. Pills paired with aromatic herbs for dispersing purposes are acceptable.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Vomiting Sourness</strong></p>
<p>Some say: Vomiting sourness is considered heat in the &quot;Suwen,&quot; while Dongyuan claims it to be cold. Why is that? I say: Vomiting sourness is different from swallowing sourness. Vomiting sourness refers to expelling sour fluid like vinegar; usually, the fluids accumulate and rise, formed from stagnation over time. Long-term accumulation leads to heat generated within the moisture, thus creating a sour taste; how can it be anything but heat? If it accumulates for too long and cannot rise and expel, lying between the lungs and stomach, unable to rise or descend, and if there’s wind-cold on the surface, the internal heat becomes even more stagnant, and the sour taste pricks the heart. When the surface is warmed, and the pores open, taking warm fragrant decoctions may temporarily relieve it; how can it be anything but cold? When the &quot;Suwen&quot; refers to heat, it speaks of the root; Dongyuan refers to cold, speaking of the end. However, Dongyuan does not mention that wind-cold from outside causes the condition, asserting that it wants to drain the lung&#39;s essence, claiming that cold medicines cannot treat sourness.

I once treated swallowing sourness with prepared Huanglian and Zhuyu, adjusted according to seasonal changes.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tracing Back to Gather</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Wang Lu】</p>
<p><strong>Vomiting, Dry Heaving, and Reverse Coughing Distinction</strong></p>
<p>I once read Cheng Wujia&#39;s &quot;Theoretical Clarifications on Cold Damage&quot; which states: Vomiting is accompanied by sound, whereas heaving is merely heaving. Hence, there is dry heaving and no dry vomiting. Therefore, when discussing vomiting, it is said that there is a desire to vomit from food intake; and when discussing throwing up, it is said that food and drink enter and then are immediately vomited, thus indicating the severity of vomiting can be understood. Furthermore, it also says: heaving is commonly referred to as reverse coughing. I harbor doubts regarding this. Hence, I consulted Zhang Zhongjing’s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; to verify and refine this statement. Zhang’s work mentions vomiting, throwing up, dry heaving, and heaving extensively, while reverse coughing is mentioned only twice. I therefore observe these distinctions collectively. Vomiting refers, as Dongyuan said, to sounds and substances expelled simultaneously. Throwing up refers to substances expelled without sound. As for dry heaving and heaving, both produce sounds without expelling substances. Dongyuan merely categorized these under heaving without discussing dry heaving. The distinction between dry heaving and heaving must lie somewhere; it is merely a matter of degree. Hence, Zhang Zhongjing speaks plainly of dry heaving, while regarding heaving he states: after sweating due to solar attack and fire exhaustion, prolonged conditions lead to delirium, and in severe cases to heaving.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: If a person with Yangming pattern wind has no bowel movement and is bloated with gas, they should not be treated. It is also said: Those who experience excessive vomiting and diarrhea, and are extremely weak with excessive sweating, may develop gas. Although there are cases that seem straightforward, when compared to dry vomiting, they are quite different. I have pondered this further: dry vomiting and gas are seen as one by Dong Yuan, but as two by Zhang Zhongjing. Viewed as one, they both involve a unique sound; viewed as two, dry vomiting is a slight form of gas, while gas is an extreme form of dry vomiting. Dry vomiting produces a light, short sound, whereas gas produces a heavy, long sound. Despite the distinctions of slight and extreme, they are fundamentally the same condition. Now, Cheng’s school considers vomiting as having sound and mixes it up with dry vomiting, and regards gas as a type of cough. This interpretation, I cannot accept. Zhang Zhongjing classifies them clearly: when both sound and material are present, it is called vomiting; when only material is expelled, it is called vomiting; and when only sound is heard, it is called dry vomiting. Because vomiting involves both sound and material, therefore, when there is sound without material, it is called dry (which means empty). As for vomiting, there must necessarily be material, so how can it be termed dry? Zhang Zhongjing added the character for &quot;dry&quot; to vomiting to differentiate it as a condition where both sound and material are present.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Cheng clan interprets &quot;nausea&quot; as having a unique sound similar to that of dry heaving, which may lose the original meaning intended by Zhongjing. Zhongjing said: for those with a sore or pus, one cannot treat nausea; when the pus is gone, healing will occur by itself. To speak of &quot;nausea exhausting the pus,&quot; can one really say it has a unique sound? Regarding cases where one experiences nausea with soup, food, or excessive drinking, it cannot be regarded as having a unique sound either. Moreover, in the discussion on Shaoyin disease, when using the method of Tongmai Sijue Decoction, it describes symptoms including dry heaving. Why then does the subsequent text in the adjustment methods say to add ginger for those who experience nausea? If Zhongjing truly considered nausea to have a unique sound, he would not have named it &quot;dry heaving.&quot; Observing the texts, when it explicitly mentions both nausea and dry heaving, it indicates that their meanings are distinct; is this not evident? Furthermore, Zhongjing has mentioned the desire to heave and the desire to vomit, but has never spoken of the desire for dry heaving or retching. The term &quot;desire&quot; pertains to something about to be expelled but has not yet done so, and it reflects a sensation of something tangible. For tangible items that are about to emerge from the chest or diaphragm, even if they have not yet come out, one can sense them beforehand.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is no audible sound of shape, then one cannot foresee what will emerge; one must wait until it has emerged before it can be known. The act of vomiting and spitting concerns tangible substances, thus it may be called desire. Dry heaving and retching, concerning formless sounds, thus cannot be called desire. Cheng Shi cites the phrases about eating grain and wanting to vomit, and consuming food only to immediately spit it out, and he claims that vomiting and spitting have different weights. His intention is to ascribe lightness to desire as expressed in vomiting, while spitting is considered heavy in its immediate action. How can one know that desire is not merely expressed as &#39;want&#39;—this set is primarily based on form and formlessness, not on weight distinctions? If it is as he says, then one with hot soup would vomit, one with food would also vomit, and when one feels a warm desire to vomit, the reverse urge to vomit would not originate from Zhongjing? He also cites popular usage of the term &#39;chew&#39; to support his point about vomiting. However, &#39;chew&#39; and &#39;retching&#39; are different in writing but similar in sound and meaning; thus, using &#39;chew&#39; to support vomiting is too shallow. Nonetheless, comparing vomiting and spitting, spitting is lighter than vomiting, and comparing spitting and dry heaving, dry heaving is lighter than spitting. However, each of these three has its own weight distinctions that cannot be firmly fixed. Yet, comparing vomiting, spitting, dry heaving, and retching, retching is indeed the heaviest, and cannot be compared to the other three. Therefore, the &quot;Tai Su&quot; states: a tree sheds its leaves when its illness is deep, and when one reaches the state of retching, the treatment becomes challenging and is ultimately not easy to manage.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Therapy</strong><br><strong>(Yuan – Zhang Jiegu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vomit Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of vomit: those resulting from accumulation of cold. They can be analyzed through the three jiaos (regions): the upper jiao is located at the stomach, connecting to the heavenly qi, and is responsible for receiving but not expelling; the middle jiao is at the zhongwan (center of the abdomen), connecting above to the heavenly qi and below to the earthly qi, responsible for digesting food and water; the lower jiao is below the navel, connecting to the earthly qi, responsible for expelling but not receiving.</p>
<p>Thus, if there is vomiting from the upper jiao, it arises from the interaction with qi. Qi is the yang of heaven, having a floating and surging pulse. The symptoms include vomiting soon after eating, thirst for water, constipation, and a sensation of uplift in the chest causing pain. Treatment should focus on redirecting qi downwards and harmonizing the middle jiao.</p>
<p>For vomiting from the middle jiao, it arises from accumulation, influenced by both yin and yang, where food and qi combine to cause pain due to accumulation. The pulse is floating and string-like. The symptoms may include pain preceding vomiting, or vomiting preceding pain. The treatment method should involve using mild toxic herbs to eliminate the accumulation, such as betel nut and wood incense to harmonize the qi.</p>
<p>For vomiting from the lower jiao, it arises from cold, an earthly condition. The pulse is deep and slow. Symptoms include vomiting food eaten in the morning by evening, or food eaten in the evening by morning, clear and smooth urination, with constipation being hard to pass. The treatment method should involve using strong toxic herbs to relieve the blockage and warm the cold condition, gradually facilitating bowel movements, and then using middle jiao herbs to harmonize, preventing constipation from resolving on its own.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For excessive vomiting, use the prepared herb formula &quot;Li Zhong Wan&quot;, replacing the white atractylodes with fresh ginger. Vomiting is often due to reversed Qi; the bland nature of atractylodes can obstruct this, making it unsuitable for non-reversed Qi cases. The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text states that individuals suffering from vomiting frequently take fresh ginger, which is considered a sacred medicine for this ailment. Fresh ginger is pungent and dispersive; thus, it should be added abundantly for those who vomit.</p>
<p>In cases of cold-induced vomiting with body heat or no heat, treatment includes Xiao Ban Xia decoction with poria, or Xiao Ban Xia decoction with tangerine peel, or a decoction of dried ginger, yellow qin, yellow lily, and ginseng. If vomiting is accompanied by cold extremities or agitation, use the &quot;Si Ni&quot; decoction.</p>

<p><strong>On Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between vomiting and regurgitation has been discussed in the Treatise on Cold Damage, yet the symptoms are not uniform: there is cold vomiting, hot vomiting, qi vomiting, phlegm vomiting, food vomiting, blood vomiting, roundworm vomiting, nausea, and dry heaving. Aside from hot vomiting and blood vomiting, in recent times the terms for vomiting are generally interchangeable, yet this does not lead to significant issues, nor does it contradict any principles. Additionally, for treatment, a small dose of Banxia Fuling Decoction or Erchen Decoction with extra ginger decocted is advisable. Fresh ginger is the sacred medicine for vomiting. Severe pain accompanied by a color resembling greens indicates death. For cold vomiting, cold stagnation in the middle, with a preference for spicy foods, and any hot substance ingested is immediately vomited, one should use Erchen Decoction with ten cloves of clove or Li Zhong Decoction with half a qian of bitter orange. If ineffective, then use Wenzhong Decoction, and in severe cases, attach with Fuzi Li Zhong Decoction or Ding Fu Decoction, and it must be taken cold.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is phlegm and fluid, when porridge or medicine reaches the mouth, it is immediately expelled; people all say it is a reversal of the stomach, but this is not the case.

<p>For external conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea, or dysentery, or cold abdominal pain, if hot medicines are administered too abruptly, it can lead to vomiting and reversal.

In this case, administer Erchen Decoction; once the vomiting and diarrhea stabilize, gradually introduce herbs for clearing the sun meridian. If there is vomiting and thirst, use Zhuling Decoction; if thirst precedes vomiting, it indicates water in the diaphragm, so use Xiao Banxia and Fuling Decoction. If there is a strong desire to drink water but it is vomited immediately after consumption, and the thirst recurs post-vomiting, this is called water counterflow, indicating that heat in the heart is affecting the small intestine, and Wuling Powder should be used. If there is no thirst but vomiting or dry retching in lesser yin, modify Lichong Decoction by removing the baie and adding fresh ginger. If there is vomiting of saliva and foam, use Wuzhuyu Decoction. In cases of vomiting between greater yin and lesser yin, greater yin should use Lichong Decoction, while lesser yin should use Sini Decoction, both with ginger boiled in. The above represents the yin condition, which is the yin within yin, and therefore should use warming remedies. When yang enters yin, it can benefit without causing vomiting; vomiting belongs to the upper (stomach) and is nearer to the exterior.

It is advisable to use either Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction. Generally, when a patient has Yang symptoms accompanied by vomiting, this indicates a combined illness; the vomiting suggests that the disease has progressed inward, and it is not simply a Yang condition. I recall a case where someone initially had Yang symptoms and persistent vomiting; when treated with warming prescriptions, there was no effect. Knowing that the Yang condition had been resolved through sweating, it was appropriate to use cooling medications, as the vomiting was due to Yang symptoms, not a combination with the Yangming or Shaoyang; thus, the vomiting was caused by heat and warm medications were ineffective. I have also witnessed a case with significant vomiting from Yang symptoms; in such instances, it sufficed to release the exterior without using emetic herbs. Additionally, there was a case where upon onset of the illness, with clear Yang symptoms and vomiting, everyone in the household displaying similar symptoms responded effectively to eight doses of Stomach Nourishing Decoction. At that time, the movement of Qi naturally aligned this way, indicating a case of cold damage with miscellaneous diseases, which should not be treated according to the regular principles of cold damage. If vomiting occurs with thirst due to summer heat, it is recommended to use Cold Agastache Decoction or Five-Ingredient Powder, along with summer relief pills.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Vomit and Swallow Sourness</strong></p>
<p>If there is phlegm-fire existing, with the chest and diaphragm feeling obstructed, causing sourness in the throat and difficulty in breathing, and if there are symptoms of vomiting and swallowing sourness, or if there is alcohol accumulation leading to diarrhea and pain, all of this is due to damp-heat. The treatment involves taking Zhi Zhu Pills with the addition of one tael each of grilled Huang Lian with ginger juice, roasted Bai Shao Yao, and Chen Pi, along with five qian each of gypsum and licorice, one qian each of sand-reducing agent and wood fragrance, and four qian of Chuan Xiong. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Vomiting sourness and swallowing sourness differ somewhat. Vomiting sourness occurs due to heat arising from dampness; swallowing sourness arises from internal deficiency and stagnation of heat. Both belong to the category of spleen and stomach deficiency-cold, being the latter stages of affliction. Thus, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; refers to fire concerning the manifestation of the illness. Dongyuan sees gastric cold as addressing the root cause of the illness. For all who suffer from this, one should first distinguish between vomiting and swallowing, and the treatment should primarily focus on tonifying the root essence. If cold and cool herbs are used, they will further harm stomach qi, leading to a blend of true and false conditions. If the spleen qi is deficient and food and drink cannot be processed, resulting in turbidity not descending, then one should use Liu Jun Zi Decoction to primarily tonify the spleen and stomach, with a slight addition of Yue Ju Pills for clearing. Therefore, Mr. Dongyuan states that if the evil heat does not affect the grain, mistakenly recognizing it as true heat and recklessly using cold and cool herbs will inevitably lead to a deterioration of the condition.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomit Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Introduction</strong>  <em>(Ming, Li Zhan)</em></p>
<p><strong>Separation of Wet and Dry Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Wet vomiting has sound and material; it occurs after eating. Dry vomiting is empty and has no material, both belong to conditions where Yangming Qi and Blood are diseased, hence vomiting is considered more severe than regurgitation. Heat-induced vomiting results in a bitter mouth, irritability, thirst, rapid pulse, warmth in the palms, while cold vomiting presents with headaches, fullness in the chest, cold extremities, and spitting froth; a slow pulse may accompany retching, and there are variations in clinical presentation. </p>
<p>In cases of damp vomiting, there is a transmission of superficial pathogens to the interior, causing the internal Qi to counterflow, thus many cases of overlapping patterns have abundant vomiting. When the three Yangs are febrile, they are treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang plus fresh ginger. For fullness in the chest accompanied by afternoon tidal fever, add Mangxiao. If vomiting is persistent and there are bowel issues, use Da Chai Hu Tang. For abundant vomiting indicating Yangming patterns but with a thin stomach unsuitable for purging, use Gan Ju Tang. For irritability and thirst, if vomiting precedes thirst, this indicates a desire for relief, treat with Zhu Ling Tang. If thirst occurs before vomiting, indicating water retention, use Chi Fu Ling Tang. If vomiting occurs immediately upon drinking water, apply Wu Ling San. For virtual thirst, utilize Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction with ginger juice, or use Zhi Shi Tang. For upper heat and lower cold vomiting, apply Huang Lian Tang. If there is cold in the stomach with diarrhea, cold extremities, and no thirst, use Li Zhong Tang minus Atractylodes with added ginger juice, or use Zheng Qi Tang with ginger juice. </p>
<p>Regarding the three conditions of Shaoyin: if there is cold drink above causing vomiting and spitting of foam, or if there is vomiting with diarrhea and thirst, treat with Si Ni San plus fresh ginger. If the pulse is deep, or there is coughing or palpitations along with water Qi, use Zhen Wu Tang minus Aconite with added ginger juice.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For cold hands and feet with warm feelings in the chest, wanting to vomit but unable to, feeling frustrated and helpless, use half-dried ginger juice with pinellia decoction. For those who are weak after sweating, use dried ginger, scutellaria, and ginseng soup. If after sweating, water or grains cannot be taken, it is critical; a small pinellia decoction can relieve this. If there is warm toxin causing vomiting, along with a feeling of heaviness in the heart and skin rashes, and if there is water evidence and vomiting, first comes the vomiting and confusion. Vomiting pus and blood indicates a reversed foul odor trying to push upwards; if it is expelled completely, one can recover. </p>
<p>For dry retching, heat in the stomach combines with grain qi rising, causing a feeling of blockage in the heart, hence one vomits with nothing to expel, and cannot eat; use Huanglian Detoxifying Decoction. For dry retching without sweat in a Taiyang condition, it indicates wind-evil obstructing upwards; use Guizhi Decoction. If in a Taiyang and Yangming combined illness, there is no diarrhea but only vomiting or dry retching, it indicates blocked internal qi rising without descending; use Gegen Decoction. For cold stomach and dried fluids with dry retching and thirst, use Lizhong Decoction. </p>
<p>In a Shaoyin condition with three symptoms: dry retching, diarrhea with weak pulse, use Baitong Decoction. For internal cold and external heat with a faint pulse about to fail, use Tongmai Sijue Decoction. If diarrhea does not stop, and there is restlessness with reversed qi and no pulse, use Baitong with pig bile decoction. </p>
<p>For Jueyin headaches with dry retching and vomiting phlegm, or self-induced diarrhea, feeling cold and restless, use Sanwei Shenyu Decoction. If there is a feeling of chest tightness that seems like shortness of breath but isn’t, seems like vomiting but isn’t, or seems like hiccuping but isn’t, feeling confused and helpless, use half-dried ginger juice with pinellia decoction or small and large tangerine peel decoction.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>Vomiting is silent with no objects present; it occurs immediately after eating. Danxi associates this with blood disorders of the Yang, but it is the stomach that primarily governs it. Vomiting that is fishy and foul indicates cold, while sour and pungent suggests heat, necessitating treatment alongside nausea. If vomiting is accompanied by weakness and pain in the legs, it indicates foot qi issues.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are distinct conditions of cold and hot qi in relation to food.</p>
<p>For cold in the stomach, symptoms include clear vomiting, cold extremities, and vomiting after prolonged food intake. Treatment includes Er Chen Tang (Two Efficients Decoction) with added ginger and cinnamon. In severe cases, add zingerone and aconite, or use clove and pinellia pills. For heat in the stomach, symptoms include a flushed face, hot extremities, and immediate vomiting after eating. Treatment involves Er Chen Tang with ginger and stir-fried scutellaria, lotus, and gardenia; if symptoms are severe, slightly add betel nut and aquilaria. For stomach pain, add ginger juice, or use kudzu and bamboo shavings soup, or modified tangerine peel and bamboo soup, or Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with bamboo shavings. </p>
<p>If constantly vomiting clear water with cold phlegm rising, it is due to heat in the spleen. For treatment, use Er Chen Tang with equal parts of atractylodes, white peony, cimicifuga, stir-fried scutellaria, gardenia, shen qu, barley sprouts, and dry ginger, either in pill or decoction form. </p>
<p>For cases of qi vomiting, where qi clashes cause chest pain, and immediate thirst follows vomiting, the treatment should focus on descending qi and harmonizing the middle. Use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentles Decoction) with added aquilaria, patchouli, platycodon, and loquat leaves, or use Qi Qi Tang (Seven Qi Decoction). </p>
<p>For vomiting due to middle jiao disturbance, where food accumulates and gas is involved, treatment may include pain followed by vomiting or vice versa. Use equal parts of aquilaria and betel nut, finely ground, and take it mixed. For moving qi, use Zi Chen Wan (Purple Sink Pill). For digesting accumulation, apply common Ping Wei San (Calm the Stomach Powder), or Er Chen Tang with green skin, sand seeds, white cardamom, hawthorn, and shen qu adjusted accordingly.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Cold in the Lower Jiao</h3>
<p>The condition of retching in the lower jiao is due to cold. Vomiting in the morning after breakfast and vomiting in the evening after dinner will lead to clear and smooth urination and constipation for a prolonged period. This is due to the yin qi being obstructed and not harmonizing with the yang. The treatment should warm the cold and unblock the secretions, supplemented with middle jiao herbs for reconciliation. This includes formulas like Fuzi Lizhong Tang, Muxiang Yunqi San paired with Lizhong Tang, Sini Tang, Dinghu San, Guding Bantang, Yangzheng Dan, and Guban Liudan Wan.</p>
<h3>No Purging</h3>
<p>In cases of vomiting, purging is generally not advisable. Symptoms such as craving cold, feeling irritable and thirsty, and severe chest and abdominal pain with constipation indicate stagnation in the large and small intestines and bladder. For heat, Da Chaihu Tang may be used to purge, while for deficiency, a moistening treatment is recommended.</p>
<h3>Damp Phlegm Fire Water</h3>
<p>For vomiting due to excess phlegm and fire, modify Er Chen Tang by adding ginger-fried Qinghao. Alternatively, Xiaojiao Zhong Tang may serve as the principal remedy. If liver fire assaults the stomach, use Dan Huang Lian Wan or single Ren Zhongbai mixed with ginger juice for ingestion. In cases with phlegm dampness obstructing the spleen’s channels, resulting in nausea and the expulsion of clear fluids or resembling bean juice, use Weiling Tang with Banxia and Banna. If water is vomited with a feeling of discomfort in the heart, first thirsty then vomiting indicates the use of Chi Fu Ling Tang. If the vomiting occurs first then thirst develops, use Zhu Ling Tang. For immediate vomiting upon taking in water, use Wuling San.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Foul odors from fish and meat lead to nausea and vomiting, mixed with saliva and blood. This purulent blood accumulates in the channels; hence, it is said that if a familial history of vomiting exists, and there is a gathering of pus, there is no need for treatment—the pus will resolve on its own. Use a double dose of the Four Substance Decoction with red Poria and Mu Dan Pi. If one&#39;s constitution is weak, use the Eight Treasure Decoction with Chen Pi.</p>
<p>If the wind pathogen affects the stomach, causing unsettled sensations or sour water pooling without the ability to ingest food, do not switch to Jin Zheng Qi Powder, Mai Dong Decoction, or An Pi Pills, as this may aggravate the condition. Only if there is prolonged pain in the hypochondrium, do you dare to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Qing Pi, Shao Yao, Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, Chuan Xiong, sand ginger, and Shen Qu.

For chest tightness and shortness of breath, use the Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If there is weak stomach cold phlegm leading to vomiting, increase the Ban Xia Decoction.</p>
<p>If there are worms causing frequent nausea, stomach pain, and expelling clear water, while temporarily stopping with food intake but worsening with hunger, this indicates the presence of roundworms in the stomach. Use Er Chen Decoction with Ku Lian Gen, Shi Jun Zi, Bai Zhu, and Wu Mei. Alternatively, one may use a mixture of tin ash and areca nut in equal parts, with rice drink for adjusting consumption. If there is vomiting resembling vegetable juice, it leads to death; this is sudden vomiting and is not due to the stomach turning over.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>According to ancient practitioners, vomiting belongs to the Yangming category, which is characterized by abundant qi and blood, thus accompanied by sound and material (vomit); both blood and qi are affected. Vomiting (tui) belongs to the Taiyang category, characterized by abundant blood and little qi, hence it involves material (vomit) without sound; this indicates a blood issue. Hiccuping (huè) belongs to the Shaoyang category, defined by abundant qi and limited blood, resulting in sound without material; this is indicative of a qi issue. Dongyuan states that both vomiting and hiccuping arise from a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, either from the invasion of cold or from diet-related harm, leading to upwards reversal and an inability to retain food. </p>
<p>The elder Jie Gu discusses three causes of qi accumulation due to cold: The upper jiao is located at the stomach area, communicates with celestial qi, and is responsible for receiving but not expelling; the middle jiao is at the center, connects to celestial qi above and terrestrial qi below, and governs the digestion of food; the lower jiao, beneath the navel, connects to terrestrial qi, and is responsible for expulsion rather than reception. Therefore, if vomiting occurs in the upper jiao, it is always caused by qi, which corresponds to the yang of heaven. Its pulse is superficial and strong. The symptoms often involve vomiting shortly after eating, with a thirst for water; treatment should focus on descending qi and harmonizing the center. For the middle jiao, vomiting is due to accumulation, with both yin and yang involved, where qi and food interact. Its pulse is superficial and wiry. Symptoms may involve pain preceding vomiting or vomiting preceding pain; the remedy should aim to eliminate accumulation and harmonize qi. For the lower jiao, vomiting arises from cold, corresponding to earth.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse is large and slow. The symptoms include vomiting food eaten in the morning by evening, vomiting food eaten in the evening by morning, clear and smooth urination, and difficulty in bowel movements. The treatment should focus on relieving the obstruction and warming the cold pathogen. Later generations further classified the conditions: if vomiting occurs immediately after food intake, it is called &quot;retching&quot;; if food is ejected shortly after swallowing, use a small Banxia decoction. If vomiting occurs as soon as the food is swallowed, it is termed &quot;violent vomiting,&quot; meaning that the food is expelled immediately after being swallowed; use ginger and tangerine peel decoction. If vomiting occurs after eating is completed, it is referred to as &quot;vomiting,&quot; meaning that vomiting follows the completion of eating, and the remedy is tangerine peel and Banxia decoction. If vomiting happens long after eating, it is called &quot;reflux,&quot; as food has been in the stomach long enough that the stomach cannot separate pure from turbid and expels it again; use boiled Jinhua pills. If vomiting occurs after subsequent eating, it is termed &quot;reversed stomach,&quot; meaning that food is retained after the first intake but is expelled on the second; it erupts from the stomach&#39;s outlet, use Yilao Zini pills. Vomiting breakfast by evening and dinner by morning indicates the accumulation of a day&#39;s worth of food, lasting as long as six hours before vomiting; this concerns the lower body illnesses, treated with Banxia, ginger, and rhubarb decoction. Among the above symptoms, the quicker the vomiting, the more it indicates issues in the upper body; the longer the vomiting, the more it suggests problems in the lower body. The interplay of yin and yang, deficiency and excess, makes it challenging to distinguish the true and false.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ancient method uses Banxia (Pinellia) and Shengjiang (ginger) as the primary agents. Only Dongyuan states that ginger can stop vomiting, but it addresses a condition of obstructed Qi due to excess in the exterior. If there is deficiency in the stomach and the Qi of grain does not flow, one should merely tonify the stomach to promote the flow of grain Qi. Therefore, if Xiao Banxia Decoction does not relieve the condition, taking Da Banxia Decoction will immediately bring relief. </p>
<p>For those with cold symptoms, there is a preference for warmth and an aversion to cold, with cold limbs and a weak pulse. One may use Erling Decoction with cloves and roasted ginger, or Lichung Decoction with Zhishi. It is essential to take these medications cold, as cold intake prevents vomiting.</p>
<p>If various medicines are ineffective, Hongdou Pills have remarkable results. </p>
<p>For those with heat symptoms, there is a preference for coolness and an aversion to heat, with restlessness and a strong pulse. Use Erling Decoction with Huanglian (coptis), Zhizi (gardenia), Zhu Ru (bamboo shavings), Pi Pa Ye (loquat leaves), Ganhua (pueraria), Shengjiang (ginger), and Lu Gen (reed root juice).</p>
<p>For Qi stagnation, with distension and fullness, add Zhishi (bitter orange), Chenxiang (aloeswood), and Muxiang (saussurea) to Erling Decoction.</p>
<p>For phlegm-dampness, which occurs upon encountering cold, commonly referred to as “cold saliva,” first use Jiangsu Decoction to take down Ling Sha Dan, followed by Qi-regulating medications.</p>
<p>For food stagnation, one must promote digestion, using Zhishi, Houpu, Cangzhu, Shenqu, Maiya, Shengjie (hawthorn), and Sharen. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When vomiting and the central qi is long deficient, one must use grains to harmonize it. It is advisable to use charred white rice, dried tangerine peel, poria cocos, pinellia, licorice, aged millet, job&#39;s tears, and glutinous rice powder, sipping on aged rice drink regularly. First induce vomiting, then purge, when the body is hot and the abdomen feels distended; this is called &quot;leaky qi.&quot; This is due to wind damage in the upper burner, with pathogenic qi lodged within, treated with Mai Men Dong decoction. If there are no bowel movements and qi is stagnant, this is termed &quot;running suckling,&quot; indicating excess heat in the lower burner, treated with ginseng decoction. For dry heaving and qi reversal, use equal parts tangerine peel and ginger. For nausea damaging the stomach, in cases of deficiency use ginseng, tangerine peel, poria, licorice, pinellia, and ginger; for excess use bitter orange peel, sand ginger, tangerine peel, pinellia, white cardamom, and patchouli. If the vomiting is bitter, the pathogen resides in the gallbladder, treated with coptis, licorice, ginger, tangerine peel, and Bupleurum. Vomiting sour is attributed to the liver; if accompanied by heat, use Zuo Jin Wan with white cardamom, ginger, bamboo shavings, and gardenia; if accompanied by cold, use Zuo Jin Wan with clove, dried ginger, white atractylodes, and agarwood. For vomiting clear water, this suggests a deficiency of qi, treated with Liu Jun Zi decoction with chi shi zhi. If expelling ascaris, the stomach is cold, treated with Li Zhong decoction adding five grains of Sichuan pepper and half an ounce of areca nut, and swallow black plum pills. Identify the causes clearly; match medicines to symptoms—do not adhere strictly to fixed patterns; only then can one respond to the endless variations.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Dry Heaving</strong></p>
<p>Dry heaving refers to the empty retching without any contents being expelled. Generally, this occurs when heat is present in the stomach along with the qi of grains, causing an upward surge of heat that results in a feeling of pressure and blockage under the heart. In cases of external deficiency where sweating leads to dry heaving, the treatment is Gui Zhi Tang, which governs spontaneous sweating. For less yin leading to diarrhea and dry heaving, the treatment is Sheng Jiang Tang, which addresses the diarrhea. If there’s spitting of saliva and foam with dry heaving associated with jueyin, the prescription is Wu Zhu Yu Tang, which governs the salivary foam. Once the pathogen departs, the vomiting will cease.</p>
<p>There are also conditions related to water qi. If the exterior of the taiyang does not resolve, resulting in water qi beneath the heart with body heat and dry heaving, slight wheezing or spontaneous diarrhea may occur, treated with Xiao Qing Long Tang. If there’s no fever but only chills, side pain, coughing with diarrhea, and dry heaving, this too is related to water qi, treated with Shi Zao Tang. For dry heaving caused by cold drinks in the diaphragm, this pertains to shaoyin, treated with Si Ni Tang.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage with heat in the stomach alongside grain qi, causing the upward surge of heat without any contents—that is termed dry heaving—and it is necessary to differentiate between excess heat and water qi for treatment, which differs from the case of hiccups. </p>
<p>After three to four days, if the pathogen transitions to the shaoyang with gallbladder involvement, resulting in chest and side pain, deafness, alternating chills and fever, bitterness in the mouth, and vomiting, feeling pulse on both yin and yang meridians reveals it is half exterior and half interior. Since the gallbladder has no pathway for discharge or intake, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang. There are three prohibitions in meridian treatment: sweating, purging, and vomiting. This is because yangming and taiyang meridians do not treat from the interior. The state of being half exterior and half interior with the yang intersecting in between is called shaoyang.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting (ou) is when both sound and substance are expelled. Expectoration (tu) is when only substance is expelled without sound. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing emphasizes &quot;gan&quot; to distinguish these, indicating that vomiting clearly involves matter. &quot;Gan&quot; signifies emptiness; thus, it is merely an empty retching without anything being expelled. However, both vomiting and expectoration involve matter being expelled; when compared, vomiting is more severe than expectoration. This is because a pathogenic influence strikes inward, causing the internal qi to rise counter to normal, hence the vomiting and the inability to retain water and food. </p>
<p>In the case of gastric heat, the pulse is wiry and rapid, and there is thirst and discomfort in the mouth; for gastric cold, the pulse is wiry and slow, there is a reversal of cold, aversion to food, and mild bowel movements; in situations where there is water qi, one feels thirst first followed by vomiting, and experiences discomfort in the diaphragm; in the presence of pus and blood, there is a fishy sensation in the throat, with a rising and surging sensation; this does not require treatment, as vomiting out the pus will lead to self-healing. These four situations must not be confused. Generally speaking, if the pathogen is partly external and partly internal, there will be more vomiting, and vomiting can also occur due to heat in the interior.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the classics say: If there is much vomiting, even if there are signs of Yangming, it should not be forcefully treated, as the qi is counterflowing, and it has not yet recovered to be solid.

<p>If one feels nauseous after eating grains, it pertains to Yangming.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Causes of Vomiting Vary</strong></p>
<p>Yang Renzhai said: It is commonly known that vomiting occurs due to disharmony in the stomach&#39;s qi. However, there are various causes such as cold in the stomach, heat in the stomach, phlegm and fluid, retention of undigested food, intrusion of wind evil into the stomach, and rebellious qi rising up. Shouldn&#39;t we investigate their origins?</p>
<p><strong>For Long-term Illness with Internal Heat, Use Spicy and Warming Herbs for Acid Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;Wood yin leads forth, fire yin brings forth.&quot; For patients with prolonged illness, the spleen and stomach are generally weak, and many belong to the category of qi stagnation. Thus, for acid vomiting, we should utilize the treatment of Dongyuan to harmonize the stomach, which is the method of using warmth for heat conditions. Some claim that Dongyuan treats acid vomiting as a cold situation, showing a lack of understanding of Dongyuan. I observe that previous scholars have argued, such as the &quot;Jufang,&quot; that using warming herbs to treat acid vomiting cannot avoid doubts about cold; this may not have rightly examined the classic&#39;s intent, which is specifically for heat conditions. Those who recognize this heat are few, with Liu Hejian being the only notable exception.</p>
<p><strong>For New Illness with Acid Vomiting, Use Cold Tastes</strong></p>
<p>Danxi said: For all cases of acid vomiting and acid swallowing, they all belong to heat. One must use Wu Zhu Yu to counter its nature and eliminate it. Stir-fried Huang Lian and stir-fried Zhi Zi are essential medicines; this is to treat the illness caused by heat inducing acidity, thus only employing cold tastes. Wu Zhu Yu must also be used to counter its heat nature. Could it be that only Danxi understands Dongyuan?<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Dong Yuan said: Vomiting and belching all pertain to the stomach, which is the chief organ, differing only in terms of the quantity of qi and blood. For example, in cases of vomiting, it relates to the Yangming channel, which has abundant blood and qi, thus resulting in both sound and substance; this indicates an illness of both qi and blood. Zhongjing stated: Even if there is much vomiting with Yangming symptoms, one must be cautious not to purge. Master Sun proclaimed that those who vomit often take fresh ginger, which is indeed the sacred remedy for vomiting. One must disperse the rebellious qi, thus using fresh ginger as the main ingredient. In cases of vomiting, it relates to the Taiyang channel, which has much blood but little qi, hence there is substance without sound; this indicates a blood illness. If food is ingested, then there will be vomiting; if food is already in the stomach, vomiting will occur, and dried tangerine peel can be used to relieve it. Belching relates to the Shaoyang channel, which has much qi and little blood, resulting in sound without substance; this indicates a qi illness, and the main remedy should be ginger combined with pinellia. Therefore, Zhu Feng suggested treating vomiting and belching with fresh ginger, pinellia, dried tangerine peel, and the like. Upon investigating the origins of these three ailments, they are all caused by weak spleen qi, or by cold invading the stomach, aggravated by dietary injuries. Hence, one should primarily use ingredients such as clove, patchouli, pinellia, poria, dried tangerine peel, and fresh ginger. If there has been pre-existing internal injury accompanied by these ailments, one should examine the deficiency and excess to resolve them internally. For phlegm and fluid accumulation, purging is essential. One must differentiate between the channels and match the appropriate remedies; disorder is not permissible.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>From the &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; text: For those who vomit undigested grain and cannot expel it, the primary treatment is Xiaobansha Decoction. It also states: For those who are prone to vomiting and originally felt thirst, but now do not, it is because there is a blockage below the heart due to fluid accumulation, which Xiaobansha Decoction addresses. The ingredients include one pound of Banxia, half a pound of fresh ginger, and seven liters of water, boiled down to one and a half liters and consumed warm in divided doses. It further states: For sudden vomiting, a sensation of fullness below the heart, fluid retention, and dizziness, the appropriate treatment is Xiaobansha Decoction plus Poria, which simply adds four taels of Poria to the previous formula. Both ginger and Banxia are effective primary agents for treating vomiting. However, for cases of obstruction in the upper burner due to excess, where the stomach is weak and the grain qi is not flowing, leading to chest blockage and vomiting, it is crucial to nourish the stomach and promote the flow of grain qi rather than using pungent herbs to drain it. Thus, if Xiaobansha Decoction does not yield results, switching to Dabanxia Decoction will provide immediate relief; this is the principle according to Zhongjing.</p>
<p>Zhongjing states: If a patient wishes to vomit, one must not force them to do so. Additionally, using Da Huang and Gan Cao to treat vomiting immediately after eating—is this acceptable? It is because the desire to vomit indicates that the illness is located above, and it can be permitted to let it act. Conversely, forcing a downward motion would surely cause stagnation and increase confusion, thus it is prohibited. If one has vomited but is unable to stop and has rising symptoms without descending ones, one should allow the downward motion to occur without haste to use Da Huang, hence it is permitted. Military strategy says: evade the sharp and strike the slow; this embodies the principle. Danxi affirmed this by stating that for any condition of vomiting, one must never forcefully purge; this is indeed correct.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Treatise on Vomiting</p>
<p>In the case of vomiting, it is crucial to discern between true and false conditions. A true condition involves some form of pathogen; removing it leads to recovery. A false condition lacks pathogen and is entirely due to the deficiency of the stomach qi. The so-called pathogen may arise from sudden cold or heat illnesses, excessive stomach fire, reversed liver qi, phlegm or water accumulation in the chest, or exterior pathogens penetrating inward, gathering between the Shaoyang and Yangming; all lead to vomiting, which are the true pathogens of this condition.</p>
<p>The so-called false conditions may arise without any internal damage or external afflictions, yet persistently lead to vomiting; since there is no pathogen, the stomach must be deficient. These can occur with slight cold exposure, minor exertion, mild dietary indiscretion, or slight liver qi reversal, all summing up to a deficiency of the stomach. In assessing vomiting&#39;s true and false conditions, stomach qi is paramount. If the stomach is strong and the spleen is healthy, then whatever food is ingested should be properly transformed, preventing vomiting. Thus, even with significant harm from cold, heat, hunger, or fullness, the stomach should not falter. However, if there is a slight stimulus and the person cannot withstand it, it is due to a weakness in stomach qi.</p>
<p>This distinction between true and false conditions should be carefully evaluated to avoid the pitfalls of misdiagnosis. If the stomach qi is inherently deficient and there is stagnation, there exists a mix of deficiency and excess, necessitating initial purification before nourishment. If there is stagnation yet middle qi is weak and struggling, the urgency lies in addressing the deficiency first; one must prioritize restoring the original qi while also providing some purification.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this context, the principles of the beginning and the end are clearly established, emphasizing the importance of understanding the balance of factors. Although those who suffer from vomiting may appear to have a “fire symptom,” as detailed later, most instances of vomiting stem from coldness invading the stomach, with cold stomach conditions being prevalent. In contrast, internal heat is rare. Moreover, vomiting caused by external factors often involves significant cold evil, making the indiscriminate use of cold and cooling medicines inappropriate. If one mistakenly uses such treatments without genuine fire symptoms, those with strong stomachs might endure it, but those with weak stomachs will certainly suffer.</p>
<p>Liu Hejian noted that intense heat in the stomach leads to vomiting, an assertion that may be an exaggeration; strict adherence to this could cause considerable harm. Additionally, Sun Zhenren asserted that the foremost remedy for vomiting is ginger, a more accurate view that surpasses Hejian’s. </p>
<p>Zhong Jing stated that in cases of typhoid fever with abundant vomiting, even if there are symptoms of the yangming layer, it should not be purged. This mainly refers to typhoid fever. However, in my opinion, this applies not only to typhoid fever but to all conditions. Why? Because vomiting in mixed conditions is particularly unlike that in typhoid fever. In typhoid fever, there is still heat evil present, but if the heat is in the upper burner and not fully infiltrating the bowels, the resulting reversal means it should not be purged. In contrast, in mixed conditions, vomiting arises not only from a cold stomach but also from a deficiency of the spleen which fails to move. If both spleen and stomach are deficient, can one truly initiate a purging? Furthermore, while the pathogenic factors may not be connected between upper and lower body, the vital energy of both is indeed interdependent. This is precisely why vomiting cannot be purged; the concern is that if disease exists above and one purges below, the lower will become even weaker, and the upper will become increasingly burdened.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Deficiency Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In general, for those whose stomach is deficient and suffer from vomiting, the symptoms are varied, and one must discern accordingly. If the stomach does not feel bloated, it is not a symptom of real evil. If there is no pain in the chest and diaphragm, it is not due to counterflow of qi. If there is no internal heat or agitation, it is not a fire symptom. If there are no exterior cold or heat symptoms, it is not a superficial evil. If there is no food or heat yet one suddenly vomits, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If vomiting is inconsistent, occurring intermittently, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If food cannot settle and one vomits upon sensing food, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If there is no counterflow of qi and one feels nausea upon smelling, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If slight cold in the back or from eating and drinking leads to vomiting, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If there is sour burping or rancid belching, along with feelings of bitterness and nausea, persistent discomfort when swallowing cold, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If incorrect treatment for illness is administered, mistakenly using harsh cold remedies when there was no vomiting to begin with, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If one eats in the morning and vomits in the evening, or eats in the evening and vomits in the morning, with food entering the middle jiao and not being digested, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If food enters the lower jiao and is not digested, it indicates a lack of yang in the earth element; thus, the life gate is deficient. In all these deficiency syndromes, it is indeed necessary to tonify. However, since the stomach inherently belongs to the earth element and does not generate unless there is fire, nor can it transform without warmth, if earth is cold, it is also deficient; a deficiency in earth signifies a deficiency in fire.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, it is said that the spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold, the earth dislikes dampness and enjoys dryness. For this reason, the &quot;Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach&quot; by Dongyuan particularly emphasizes the method of warming and tonifying, which is specifically set for the stomach qi and should not be overlooked! In Hejian, it is mentioned that vomiting arises from stomach fire, which is abundant and solid. Now, I say vomiting arises from stomach cold, which is abundant and deficient. Heat and cold, if both lose their balance, are not aligned with the principle of harmony. It is not to say that there are absolutely no cases of vomiting caused by heat; however, cases of vomiting due to heat are rare, while cases due to cold are common. Vomiting caused by a strong stomach is rare, while that caused by a weak stomach is frequent, hence the necessity for this distinction. </p>

<p>Any instance of food stagnation in the stomach leading to vomiting must have a causative factor and supporting evidence.

<p>When cold pathogens invade the stomach causing vomiting, there are three presentations: Firstly, ingestion of cold or raw foods or mistakenly eating items that are cold in nature can harm the stomach qi and lead to vomiting.

Simply cooling the heat will settle the tapeworms; for mild cases, herbal infusions to reduce the heat suffice, while for more severe conditions, the use of the &quot;Ten Thousand Responding Pills&quot; is applicable. </p>
<p>For those who expel tapeworms due to excessive stomach cold, the internal cold is too potent, preventing the tapeworms from staying inside. Warming the stomach will restore calmness to the tapeworms, and remedies like &quot;Wu Mei Pills&quot; by Zhongjing can be used. </p>
<p>If the expulsion is due to a deficiency of the stomach with no food, this indicates that the stomach storage is empty, leading the tapeworms to seek nourishment and thus come out. This is a sign of significant stomach qi deficiency; therefore, it is critical to nourish the stomach and warm the center to protect against fundamental failure, employing practices such as warming the stomach infusion, regulating the middle soup, and the &quot;Sheng Zhu Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>The aforementioned three methods indeed address the tapeworms. However, it should be noted that there are dead and live tapeworms. If dead tapeworms are expelled, one may simply treat the vomiting as previously discussed. If live tapeworms continue to emerge, one must take measures to eliminate them. Tapeworms are instinctively deterred by sour and bitter substances, so adding Wu Mei as an adjunct will help subdue them. For cases of robust heat in the stomach, one may add bitter neem root or Coptis as they are also effective. Any lingering issues will be detailed in the subsequent sections on tapeworms and their treatment.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treating Vomiting Caused by Weak Stomach</strong></p>
<p>In treating vomiting due to stomach deficiency, it is crucial to carefully consider the qualities of the substances used. For those with a strong stomach, even toxic substances can be tolerated, regardless of their qualities. However, for a weak stomach, differentiation of suitable and unsuitable substances becomes essential. The more severe the stomach weakness, the more significant the relationship between substances&#39; qualities and the condition. A weak stomach is highly sensitive to unmanageable qualities. Not only can it not tolerate strong, fishy, or foul odors, but even mild fragrances and ordinary food smells can be intolerable. The same goes for those who are aware of their condition. A weak stomach is particularly sensitive to flavors; it cannot withstand extreme bitterness or poor tastes, nor can it tolerate even mild saltiness or bitterness, along with the intrinsic tastes of grains. This highlights why vomiting from stomach deficiency is so impacted by flavors. If there is any slight mismatch, it can lead to immediate vomiting upon ingestion, which offers no benefit. Therefore, in treating symptoms like vomiting due to yang deficiency, all fragrant, salty, sour, and spicy flavors should be measured with personal discretion. If anything appears unsuitable, it must not be used. Instead, one should focus on supplementing the yang; once the yang is restored, the vomiting will inevitably stop. This is the most reliable method and should not be neglected.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I once encountered a man with the surname Shen, who was a physician by trade and worked very hard. He was nearly forty years old and due to suffering from a hernia that fell downward, he attempted to raise it using a saline solution to induce vomiting. Unaware that his stomach was weak and could not tolerate salty substances, he ended up vomiting incessantly, with both salt water and food coming up for a whole day and night. Suddenly, he passed dark blood in his stool, one or two bowls worth, and his pulse became weak and barely detectable, almost as if it would stop altogether. This was due to the vomiting harming his stomach qi and the extreme weakness of his spleen, compounded by the saline solution which caused blood to flow, preventing it from being retained in the body.</p>
<p>I instructed him to immediately use ginseng and ginger to revive the vital energy that was on the verge of collapse, hoping it might help. Suddenly, another physician arrived and said, &quot;All rejections and upward pressures are related to heat. The blood in the stool is also due to heat; can we still use ginseng and ginger? It is better to quickly drink young boy&#39;s urine; then the vomiting can be cured, and the bleeding will stop.&quot; The man believed there was reasoning in this, and upon swallowing the urine, he experienced extreme nausea and continued to vomit uncontrollably, until his life subsequently faded away.</p>
<p>Ah! Even a person with a strong stomach would feel nauseated at the mere thought of urine, let alone adding it to someone who cannot stop vomiting! It is not only pitiful for those who die this way but how resentful it is that such a practitioner dares to call himself a physician!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nausea Treatment</p>
<p>Nausea is a condition characterized by a rebellious stomach, leading to discomfort and restlessness. Generally, when there is a desire to vomit, saliva will flow from the mouth, making swallowing difficult. The more one tries to swallow, the more nausea follows, often leading to vomiting. However, there are instances of nausea without actual vomiting. Although this condition is termed nausea, it fundamentally pertains to stomach issues rather than heart problems. </p>
<p>The causes of this condition can include cold, food stagnation, phlegm and fluids, foul Qi, fire pathogens, and dampness injuring the stomach, or other pathogens from maladies like cold, malaria, or dysentery affecting the stomach. To understand it better, one must discern between deficiency and excess, and between cold and heat. In cases of excess, the nausea ceases once the pathogen is removed; it comes quickly and goes quickly. In cases of deficiency, the stomach Qi must be significantly restored for recovery to occur.</p>
<p>Moreover, this condition is predominantly due to deficiency and cold, with at least eight or nine out of ten cases falling into this category. Even in cases of excess nausea, the spleen Qi is often weak and unable to properly transform food, leading to the symptoms. Therefore, in treating nausea, one must recognize the presence of both excess and deficiency, and avoid rash attacks while considering the importance of the stomach Qi.</p>
<p>For cases of deficiency and cold nausea, these are the most frequent presentations. If not acute and common, or if individuals lack sufficient vitality, it is always due to weakened stomach Qi. Therefore, treatment should primarily focus on warming and strengthening.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The occurrence of sour vomiting is discussed as follows: In Hejian, it is said to be caused by heat, while in Dongyuan, it is said to be caused by cold. The principles of medicine have a certain consistency; how can there be such discrepancies? Is it possible that the reasoning can be switched based on these two opinions? Surely, one of these views must be erroneous, and I cannot refrain from voicing my stance that Dongyuan&#39;s perspective is correct while Hejian&#39;s is wrong. </p>
<p>How can this be demonstrated? The reasoning from Hejian is actually rooted in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The text states that all instances of sour vomiting, due to sudden force or pressure downwards, belong to heat. Thus, Hejian interprets all disease processes as resulting from fire, and harshly criticizes the stance that predominantly attributes this to cold. Yet, they do not recognize that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; is merely addressing conditions in relation to changes in Qi and broadly categorizing illnesses, rather than asserting that all vomiting and diarrhea are internal heat conditions.</p>
<p>If we discuss heat, how then is it also said that cold Qi attacks the intestines and stomach, causing pain and resulting in vomiting? Further, it is said that when Taiyang is revived, the heart and stomach produce cold, leading to disharmony in the chest, resulting in the expulsion of clear fluid, and causing belching. This indicates that there are cold factors involved in vomiting; can we thus classify everything as heat?

<p>Regarding the argument that the acidity from Hejian is incorrect. Hejian states: Acid is the flavor of the liver&#39;s wood. When fire is strong and governs metal, it cannot balance wood; thus, the liver&#39;s wood becomes excessive, resulting in acidity. For instance, when foods are hot, they easily lead to acidity. Some say that vomiting acid is due to cold, which is a mistake. Those who mistakenly claim it is cold merely suggest that excessive consumption can harden and create stickiness or damage cold substances, causing the phenomena of belching acid. Therefore, folk medicine focuses on temperate and harmonious treatments for the spleen and stomach. </p>
<p>Little do they know that the classics say that when a person is harmed by cold, it manifests as a heat illness. Hence, any internal harm caused by cold substances could lead to an excess of yin over yang, resulting in illness due to cold, or the clash of cold and heat causing the stomach and intestines&#39; yang energy to stagnate, leading to heat. There are also cases of internal harm from cold resulting in a rebound illness of heat, where profuse sweating and heat relief may occur, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one has long been troubled by sourness and it does not cease, then it is inappropriate to warm it; instead, it is advisable to use cold medications to purge it, and later to adjust it with cooling medicines, leading to the resolution of heat and the harmonization of qi. All of this are the teachings of Hejian; whenever I see it, I cannot help but repeatedly marvel. Observing what is said about the pathogenesis, it stems from fire to metal, from metal to wood, and from wood to the spleen, hence the sourness. If one speaks faintly in inquiry, it could indeed turn around; under such circumstances, pointing at a deer and calling it a horse would face no reproach. It is solely because they hold steadfastly to it being heat that they cannot help but twist and turn in explanation like this. However, if I say it is cold, it is not so. Sourness fundamentally belongs to the flavor of the liver wood. Why not say that the fire is weak and cannot generate earth, thus the spleen&#39;s qi is deficient and the liver&#39;s evil burdens it, resulting in sourness? Would this not be clearer in reasoning? Why then insist on such convoluted explanations? Furthermore, as the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states, when a person is harmed by cold, it is considered a disease of heat; this refers to the injury of cold evils at the surface, leading to the fever of the three yangs, and when transmitted internally, it becomes the internal heat of yangming. Can it really be said that internal injuries from cold substances also represent disease heat? Is it plausible to think that one can resolve inner injuries from cold by sweating them out? Even for robust individuals, should they inadvertently be harmed by raw cold, lingering for a long time and accumulating into heat, this is a case of prolonged stagnation transforming into heat; could it truly be due to raw cold causing subsequent heat? Moreover, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; originally speaks of external pathogens, while Hejian improperly uses it as evidence for internal injuries, which is quite erroneous.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The sour taste represents the gathering of energy; in the west, the lung is associated with metal, which is strong. Cold water is the child of metal; the child can cause the mother to bear fruit. Thus, one should use large doses of salty, warming agents to drain the child, complemented by acrid and warming substances, to drain the lung&#39;s fullness. If the illness arises from heat attacking, this is a mistake. The essence of various illnesses is related to the heart being affected, with turbid energy not descending, resulting in a fullness in the center. Can cold medicine treat this? This is the argument of Dongyuan, which I believe is most reasonable. However, the way he articulates it can be too obscure; terms like &quot;gathering energy&quot; and &quot;the west&#39;s metal being strong, water as the child of metal&quot; may not be easily understood, and many often overlook them. Even in Danxi’s teachings, he also mentions that Dongyuan does not speak of external wind and cold but establishes the idea of gathering energy to drain the fullness of lung metal. He further argues that cold medicine cannot treat sourness, yet employs Anwei Decoction and the modified Erchen Decoction, both containing clove, while lacking methods for treating damp-heat accumulation. This does not align with the classic understanding. Upon examining Danxi&#39;s treatment methods, they utilize Zhu Lian Pill and Erchen Decoction, and also mention that it is advisable to use fried Wu Zhu Yu, aligning with its nature to properly address the issue.

The gradual onset of cold must begin above as well, as the yang qi declines. When it is said that the metal is strong, it does not mean the fullness of lung qi; it actually refers to an excess of cold qi. The saying that the son envelops the mother implies that with cold in the upper burner, the gathering of qi becomes more intense. Thus, using warm and hot remedies to drain the son is merely a suitable way to support yang and suppress yin. If Danxi did not grasp this intention and instead criticized it, what is the reason? For instance, cloves possess a spicy and refreshing flavor without toxicity; they are most appropriate for addressing cold stagnation in the middle burner, where qi is not flowing smoothly. How could one warn against them as if they are dangerous and instill fear in future generations? Danxi only understood that cloves should not be treated harshly, yet he did not realize the roles of Huanglian and Huangqin. How could one lightly treat sour substances that are suited for such cases? Nonetheless, even though my explanation stands, I must further clarify the discussions on cold and heat, as doubts remain. Thus, I will reiterate my arguments.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The arguments stating that sourness is due to heat must each have their explanations, right? Liu Hejian says that when food is hot, it easily becomes sour. Dai Yuanli states that if grains and meat are in a moist and hot vessel, they can easily turn sour. Others claim that when observing winemaking, if the fermentation process is cool, the wine turns sweet, but if it’s overly hot, it turns sour. Isn&#39;t it clear that sourness arises from heat? All these theories sound credible, but insisting that people do not accept them is impossible. In matters of this nature, they are often mistaken. It’s like an archer who claims to be skilled simply by not deviating from front, back, or sides. They do not realize that even such basic errors are enough to question their skill in archery. The various theories about this are very much the same. How can we know? One must examine patients by reasoning; reasoning must be based on truth. Just as the sourness of food seems to stem from heat, it appears plausible, yet when food is in a pot, if it can transform without becoming sour, it is because the heat is strong and quickly changes it without leaving anything behind. However, if placed in a vessel, it will take a long time to sour; this is due to accumulation and does not arise from heat. I have often seen water that has been cold and stagnant for a long time, which inevitably becomes sour. Is this due to heat? No, it’s due to inactivity. Furthermore, when winemaking is concerned, heat leading to sourness seems plausible. However, it is only after two or three days of fermentation, when the accumulated heat dissipates, that it becomes sour. There has never been a case where heat immediately causes sourness. Moreover, the digestive energy in humans is primarily derived from strong heat, so when food enters the stomach during meals, it can be digested in an instant; this reflects the true response of yang fire in its proper state.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If, like a winemaker, one must wait until the end of the day for the wine to be complete, then one cannot eat again that day; how can one not feel weary in the stomach? If it must be like cold fermentation that yields no sourness and thus is said to be without heat, then the transformation of food must also take days. Is it not evident that the yang energy in the stomach would have already depleted? It is clear that the stomach&#39;s energy should be warm; it cannot endure being slightly cool. A wine vessel should remain open; it should not become damp and stagnant. Therefore, how can the transformation in a wine vessel be as swift as the energy in the stomach, and how can the strength of stomach energy be compared to the slowness of a wine vessel? This is a matter of nature and reasoning; it is not merely a matter of tenfold, and there is no need for further clarification. Moreover, the leftover food in the stomach values quick transformation. If the yang energy in the stomach does not decline and operates healthily as usual, why would there be any sourness? If the firepower is insufficient, then the transformation must be slow. Once the transformation is delayed, food accumulates and cannot move, leading to sourness and rotting; this sourness is a gradual onset of spoilage. Thus, any illnesses characterized by sour stomach discomfort are often seen when food does not move quickly, resulting in discomfort from self-consumption, and will inevitably lead to fullness, stifling, and diarrhea. Could it not be the weakness of the spleen and yang deficiency in the stomach, yet still be misinterpreted as heat? I once encountered a gentleman in the capital who suffered from this and sought treatment from me; I told him it was cold, yet he persisted in believing it was heat, adhering to the winemaking argument, unable to differentiate, and ultimately fell victim to the likes of qinlian, never coming to understand. Is this not a case of misunderstanding from earlier discussions? It is indeed lamentable! Thus, I say: it is vital for one to discern truth and reason. If one grasps false reasoning and stubbornly clings to misplaced doubts, leading to major harm, it is nothing but this sort of case.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Furthermore, regarding the secondary issues, there is fundamentally no evidence for sour vomiting or sour regurgitation; these may arise incidentally due to vomiting, whether sour or bitter, along with various intolerable flavors. All of these are caused by phlegm and fluid accumulation in the stomach and intestines, leading to foul or turbid tastes, especially below the middle burner (Zhongwan). If the movement is downward, it goes unnoticed by people; if it rises, it is difficult to endure at the throat and mouth. </p>
<p>Concerning these three conditions, those in the upper and middle burners are simply due to deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, which are unable to process properly; treatment for this must involve warming. As for those occasionally arising in the lower burner, there may be both cold and heat present, but treatment should be based on the symptoms of vomiting; once vomiting ceases, sour and bitter flavors will no longer be present.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is merely my analysis, and I cannot help but approach the matter delicately. In practical terms, those with strong stomachs have no time to dwell on sourness and bitterness; if these sensations occur, it must be because of stagnation and blockage. This should be carefully examined according to the symptoms. If there are no signs of heat or a heated pulse to rely on, and one insists on the idea of heat arising from dampness without distinguishing between strength and weakness, then solely using coldness and cooling methods has led to many errors.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen and stomach are deficient in qi, especially in middle age as one becomes gradually weaker, leading to reduced food intake and occasional sour belching, it is best to gently tonify the spleen and stomach. This can be done with formulas like Lizhong Decoction, Wengui Decoction, or Shengjiang Decoction; one must definitely avoid using cooling and depleting medications. If the deficiency is in the yin aspect and the lower burner is not warm, causing water pathogens to rise and create sourness, it is most effective to use the Recipe for Nourishing Yin. </p>
<p>Danxi said: To treat sourness, one must use Wu Zhu Yu, following its nature to counter it, which is indeed a method of correction. However, it is not merely about following its nature. Its nature is warm and it is most effective in warming the middle and lower burners; its taste, being pungent and bitter, is best at overcoming the sour and heavy flavors. To call it a corrective method is an exaggeration. </p>
<p>Using Huang Lian as the sovereign herb to treat sour vomiting is indeed Danxi&#39;s method. Observing his case studies, there was a patient who had sour lumps rising from the chest straight to the throat, which was very severe. By making a strong decoction of Huang Lian and cooling it before giving it to address the sour lump, just a few drops caused it to descend. The bitter taste sinks down, so when the sourness encounters bitterness, it immediately descends. This is also a method of calming boiling water with soup.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms of vomiting are often attributed to a deficiency of the stomach, but they are actually caused by a deficiency of the kidneys. Regardless of whether food is ingested and immediately expelled, it reflects the decline of the kidneys. All instances of vomiting are fundamentally due to kidney deficiency. Thus, treating vomiting without addressing the kidneys fails to address the root of the illness. </p>
<p>The formula consists of three qian of ginseng, five qian each of white atracary, job’s tears, and foxnut, three grains of amomum, and five fen of wuzhuyu, to be decocted and taken. This formula appears to be a remedy for the spleen and stomach, but it is, in fact, a treatment for the kidneys. Aside from ginseng, which supports the stomach, all other ingredients enter the kidney channel and do not simply remain in the spleen. Kidney fire nourishes the spleen, allowing the spleen’s earth to generate the stomach; when the stomach qi transforms, vomiting and nausea begin to settle. This is a treatment for the stomach using kidney remedies—does anyone realize this?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in cases of severe vomiting where the tongue resembles a thorn and both eyes are red and swollen, people tend to think it is due to heat, not knowing that it is actually due to the dryness of kidney water, causing fire not to be contained and water not to moisten—resulting in immediate expulsion of food. The appropriate method is to use a decoction of Liuwei Dihuang Tang, allowing ample drinking, which will diminish the excess heat and enable food and drink to be ingested. The stomach serves as the gate of the kidneys; the fire in the stomach must depend on the water from the kidneys to moisten it. If kidney water is depleted and cannot ascend to moisten the spleen and stomach, then stomach fire will boil, surging upwards to cause red and swollen eyes and a thorn-like tongue.</p>
<p>However, this condition can be both restless and calm—at times longing for water, but when water is offered, there is reluctance to drink. Even when compelled to drink, it doesn’t bring much relief. This indicates a false heat above and true cold below.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, it is essential to use aconite, cinnamon, and dried ginger, which are all pungent and warming substances, and to employ ginseng in abundance to stabilize changes. This ensures that the various medicines are evenly distributed, ultimately embodying the warm energy of spring, naturally dispelling cold evils and stopping the vomiting. This is the reason why this formula is both dominant and remarkable. </p>
<p>In cases of significant vomiting, it is clear that there is a deficiency of cold, and using multiple liang of ginseng is beneficial. However, vomiting should not be uniformly treated; if the condition is not urgent, it is acceptable to use less and gradually increase the dosage. If the cold is not severe and the vomiting is mild, then adding a couple of liang of ginseng might lead to an increase in fullness. </p>
<p>While significant vomiting predominantly results from cold deficiency, there are also cases of vomiting due to heat, which cannot be overlooked. In cases of heat-induced vomiting, it must be accompanied by phlegm, unlike cold vomiting, which is purely clear water. For heat vomiting, ginseng should not be used; instead, it is appropriate to drink Er Chen Tang.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>若寒吐必须加人参两许，而杂以辛热之品，始能止呕而定吐。第人参可以暂用，而不可日日服之。吐多则伤阴，暂服人参止吐则可，若日日服之，必至阳有余而阴不足，胃中干燥，恐成闭结之证矣。所以人参可暂而不可常也。　　呕吐之证，一时而来，亦小证也。然而倾胃而吐，必伤胃气，胃气一伤，多致不救。其证有火有寒，火吐宜清火而不可降火，寒吐宜袪寒而不可降寒。盖降火则火引入脾，而流入于大肠，必变为便血之证；降寒则寒引入肾，而流入于膀胱，必变为遗溺之证矣。<a id="orig-103p" href="#trans-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is severe vomiting, one must add a small amount of ginseng and mix it with warm and spicy ingredients to stop the vomiting effectively. Ginseng can be used temporarily, but it should not be taken daily. Excessive vomiting can damage the yin; therefore, using ginseng temporarily to stop the vomiting is acceptable, but if taken daily, it will surely lead to an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin, resulting in dryness in the stomach, which may cause blockage. Hence, ginseng can be used temporarily but should not be taken continuously.</p>
<p>Vomiting is a condition that arises quickly and is a minor ailment. However, if the stomach is tilted and vomits, it will inevitably harm the stomach qi, and once the stomach qi is damaged, it often leads to severe consequences. The symptoms may be caused by heat or cold; for heat-induced vomiting, one should clear the heat but must not suppress it. For cold-induced vomiting, one should dispel the cold but must not suppress it. Suppressing heat brings the heat into the spleen and flows into the large intestine, which may lead to hematochezia; suppressing cold brings the cold into the kidneys and flows into the bladder, likely resulting in urinary incontinence.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I have now formulated two remedies: </p>
<p>The first treats heat-related vomiting, called the Clear Heat and Stop Vomiting Decoction. It consists of one tael of Poria, two qian of Ginseng, three pieces of Sand Ginger, and three qian of Huang Lian, which should be decocted in water and taken orally. This remedy clears heat and reduces fever, thus stopping the vomiting on its own. Its effectiveness lies in Poria&#39;s ability to dissipate fire&#39;s influence, gently directing the heat downwards rather than forcefully expelling it. Moreover, Ginseng supports the stomach&#39;s energy, allowing it to counteract the presence of water naturally, making it unnecessary to deliberately stop the vomiting. Adding Sand Ginger also aids in halting nausea, which is why a single dose is sufficient to stop the vomiting.</p>
<p>The second treats cold-related vomiting, called the Disperse Cold and Stop Vomiting Decoction. It contains two taels of Bai Zhu, five qian of Ginseng, one qian each of Fu Zi and Gan Jiang, and three fen of Clove, decocted in water and taken orally. This formula disperses cold while still using tonics to strengthen the spleen and support digestion. Thus, the cold cannot rise uncontrollably, and it also cannot descend freely; it must escape from the center and outwards.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>一剂亦即奏功如响。　　胃吐由于脾虚，脾气不下行，自必上反而吐，补其脾气，则胃气自安。用人参、茯苓各三钱，白朮五钱，甘草、肉桂、神曲、半夏各一钱，砂仁三粒，水煎服。此方乃治脾之药居多，何以用之于胃吐之病反宜也？盖胃为脾之关，关门之沸腾，由于关中之溃乱，然则欲关外安静，必先关内敉宁。方中全用补脾之药，则脾气得全，又何患胃口之吐哉？况方中又有砂仁、半夏、神曲等类，全是止吐之品，有不奏功如神者乎？此又脾胃双治之妙法也。<a id="orig-105p" href="#trans-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A single dose acts effectively, like a response to a sound. Stomach vomiting is due to spleen deficiency; when spleen energy fails to descend, it naturally rebounds and causes vomiting. By nourishing spleen energy, stomach energy can stabilize. Use three qian of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atracanthus, one qian each of licorice, cinnamon, medicated leaven, and pinellia, along with three seeds of cardamom, and decoct them in water for consumption. This prescription primarily consists of medicines that nourish the spleen, so why is it also suitable for treating stomach vomiting? It is because the stomach is the gateway of the spleen; the turmoil at this gateway arises from chaos within. Therefore, to ensure peace outside the gateway, one must first pacify the chaos inside. The formula exclusively uses spleen-nourishing medicines, thus the spleen energy is fully restored; what concern is there for vomiting from the stomach? Moreover, the formula includes cardamom, pinellia, and medicated leaven, all of which are effective in stopping vomiting. Is there anything that doesn’t work like a miracle? This is indeed a marvelous method that treats both the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method for Treating Sour Ingestion and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Ingesting sourness relates to heat; diarrhea relates to cold. It appears that heat and cold are distinctly different, and therefore treatment methods should vary. However, it is not understood that while sour ingestion is heat, it arises from the stagnation of liver qi; and while diarrhea is cold, it stems from the liver wood overcoming the spleen. If one were to treat liver stagnation with one method and nourish the spleen with another, the earth element would collapse and the wood would also deteriorate. It is better to address both issues within a single formula. </p>
<p>The formula uses Chaihu and Cheqianzi, each for one qian; Chenpi, Gancao, and Shenqu, each for five fen; Bai Shaoyao for five qian; and Fuling for three qian, prepared by decoction and taken. Both conditions will be resolved. The uniqueness of this formula lies in the efficacy of Bai Shaoyao, as it is a medicine for the liver channel and is particularly good at alleviating liver qi stagnation; when the wood is relieved, it no longer overcomes the stomach above nor the spleen below.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this formulation, there are also Plantago and Poria to disperse the dampness caused by water, which, when eliminated, flows out through urination. How is there any remaining water to swallow the sourness or residual fluids for diarrhea? Moreover, there are also Pinellia and Massa Medicata Fermentata to resolve phlegm and transform remnants. This is a treatment that possesses both a comprehensive and targeted effect, yet people do not fully appreciate this.</p>
<p>Regarding diseases of the liver meridian, symptoms such as fullness and distension in the flanks and sour belching and vomiting signify the stagnation of liver wood. The correct method of treatment involves using five qian of white peony, two qian of bupleurum, each one qian of stir-fried gardenia fruit, poria, aged atractylodes, pinellia, and licorice, along with five fen of massa medicata and three qian of moutan root, all decocted in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of white peony, moutan, and bupleurum, as these three herbs are specifically indicated for the liver wood, particularly white peony, which excels at pacifying the liver without harming the spleen earth. The earth is nourished, allowing the wood to become more comfortable; when the wood is relaxed, the qi is invigorated, alleviating the pain and gradually calming the vomiting.</p>

<p>Acupuncture Techniques:</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: In cases of heart heat disease, heat causes sudden heart pain, restlessness, tendency to vomit, headache, red face, and no sweating; needle the hand&#39;s lesser yin and sun meridians. In cases of spleen heat disease, there is initial heaviness in the head, cheek pain, anxiety with a bluish complexion, desire to vomit with body heat; needle the foot&#39;s greater yin and yang ming meridians. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: Tendency to vomit with bitter fluid, prolonged sighing, a feeling of dread in the heart, fear of being captured—indicative of bile stagnation and reverse qi in the stomach. If bile leaks, the mouth becomes bitter; if stomach qi reverses, there will be bitter vomiting, thus it is called &quot;vomiting bile.&quot; Acupuncture should be applied three cun below the stomach to relieve the reversed qi. If reversed, needle the lesser yang blood vessels to close the bile and adjust its excess and deficiency to expel the pathogenic factor. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: In cases of heat illness, if sweating does not occur along with bitter vomiting and restlessness, the &quot;Chengguang&quot; point is the main treatment. For symptoms of wind in the head and neck, lacking sweat, with chilling and coldness, nausea, tight eyes radiating pain to the back of the head, and heaviness with neck pain, the &quot;Yuzhen&quot; point is the main treatment. For drunkenness with wind-heat, with pain in both temples, inability to eat or drink, and frequent vomiting, the &quot;Shu Gu&quot; point is utilized.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Theology&quot; states: The method for guiding vomit involves sitting upright, with both hands placed behind to grasp the wrists and massage the ribs, inhaling and exhaling seven times. Switching hands left and right is the same. This technique eliminates abdominal cold and removes accumulated gas from the stomach, promoting the proper flow of food and preventing vomiting. </p>
<p>Another method: Lying down, extend the legs and elevate the heels of both feet with both hands; using nasal breaths, extend for seven breaths to eliminate food-related nausea. </p>
<p>Another method: Sit up straight and stretch both legs, using both hands to grasp the feet, extending for twelve breaths to heal the stomach’s inability to tolerate food and vomiting. Press the soles of the feet with crossed hands to relieve pain, and rest the head on the knees while extending for twelve breaths to restore the stomach&#39;s ability to accept food. </p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states: For the method of guiding sourness, first visualize pushing back to the kidneys; at the kidney area, imagine water rising to the top of the head, dripping down to wash the heart. </p>
<p>For guidance on food-related vomiting, pay attention to the time associated with the Yin and Yang cycles, rise from bed in an empty state while dressing, stand straight, forcefully grasp both elbows with both hands, with the toes touching the ground and the heels suspended; exerting strength for the count of twenty-nine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: The Left Prime Minister of the Central Secretariat, Minister Shi, at the age of seventy, during the ninth month of the Dingmao year, suffered from internal injuries due to self-indulgence. He felt heavy in his limbs, had no appetite, was lethargic and talkative, his tongue had no taste, experienced abdominal pain, and had headaches along with nausea. A physician prescribed Tongsheng San in large doses, covered him with thick clothing, and as a result, he sweated profusely; however, the earlier symptoms did not improve but worsened instead. He consulted several doctors, but after four months, he remained unhealed. I was summoned to Yan and ordered to treat him. Upon examination, I found the six pulses to be deep, thin, and slightly string-like. He had no desire to eat, and if he did eat, he would vomit. His middle qi was not balanced, stagnating in its ascent and descent, his mouth and tongue were dry, he experienced dizziness in the head and eyes, felt tired in his limbs, and his ankles were cold; he did not wish to get out of bed. The Prime Minister had never consumed alcohol, had a naturally lean physique, and due to the internal injuries from self-indulgence, along with excessive sweating, he was severely drained of bodily fluids, causing his spleen and stomach to become even more deficient, unable to nourish the myriad channels throughout the body, leading to his condition. Without warm, sweet, and spicy medicinal ingredients, it would be impossible to nurture his qi. The classics state: &quot;The spleen needs to be eased; urgently eat something sweet to relax it.&quot; Additionally, if the spleen is insufficient, it should be supplemented with sweetness. Huangqi and Renshen, which are sweet, nourish the spleen and stabilize the center, thus are used as the main ingredients. If the body&#39;s form is insufficient, it should be warmed with qi.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Angelica is warm and tonifies the blood, alleviating dryness. Saussurea is warm and helps to regulate the flow of qi. Fresh ginger, cardamom, and grains of paradise are hot and sweet, dispelling internal cold and regulating vital energy. Atractylodes, honey-fried licorice, and orange peel are warm and sweet-bitter, nourishing the stomach. Wheat bran relaxes the stomach and harmonizes digestion, while medicinal yeast, being hot and pungent, helps to eliminate stagnation and aid digestion. The above ingredients should be chewed and decocted in water for consumption. Vomiting stops, appetite increases, and the previous symptoms will resolve in three days. Those attending said: Although the previous symptoms have disappeared, why haven’t we had a bowel movement in nine days? I replied: The Prime Minister is older and weaker, has both sweat and urination, and suffers from insufficient spleen-stomach energy; the vital qi is deficient and fluids are not nourishing. How could one dare use cold and toxic medicines to purge him? Zhang Zhongjing said: After excessive sweating, if urination increases and stool becomes hard, one must not use the Chengqi Decoction. Even if there is internal stagnation, honey decoction should be used to guide it out. Shortly thereafter, more than twenty hardened stools were expelled, and he felt relief in his abdomen, with regulated qi flow. After taking the same medicine, he was delighted to eat, but if there were any adverse reactions, he should consume pills with orange peel and atractylodes for digestion. After a month, his illness had stabilized. The Prime Minister inquired: Since the illness is gone, what medicine should I take to prevent its recurrence? I replied: No, simply be cautious with your words, moderate your diet, and do not take medicine. Using medicine is akin to administering punishment; if the people have sinned, they are punished; if the body is ill, it is treated with medicine. To impose punishment without wrongdoing is to abuse the populace; to administer medicine without illness damages the vital qi. The military guidelines say: It is right to take medicine when needed and to relinquish it when not. The Prime Minister was pleased and agreed.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Effective and Reliable Formulas&quot; states: During the Zhenghe era, a man fell ill with typhoid fever, and after sweating, he felt cool. After several days, he suddenly began to vomit, and neither medicine nor food could be kept down. The doctors all administered drugs like clove, aromatic herb, and talc, but he vomited as soon as he swallowed. I said: This is precisely the residual heat remaining in the stomach after sweating; a decoction of Sun Zhao Zhu&#39;s bamboo shoots is just what is needed. I urgently treated him with the medicine, and he was immediately cured.</p>
<p>&quot;The Correct Transmission of Medicine&quot; states: In the city, a woman from the Huang family, nearing thirty, suffered from a weakness in the stomach due to improper diet after giving birth, resulting in gastrointestinal incapacity for over forty days. She felt nauseous and vomited at the very sight of grain or medicine, and thus sought my treatment. I said: If medicine cannot be ingested, how can we treat her? She insisted passionately, so I prepared a formula using: one qian each of ginseng, white atractylodes, and poria, two fen of licorice, five fen each of dried tangerine peel, aromatic herb, and sand kernel, one qian of roasted malt, one he of ten years old processed rice, and two large bowls of water. I boiled it, soaked it, smashed lower dragon gall, stirred it finely, allowed it to settle, and took one bowl of the mixture, adding ginger and jujube, and boiled it with the previous ingredients until reduced by seven parts. After cooling slightly, she took this medicine without vomiting. Additionally, I made a broth with the processed rice to give her regularly. Each day, she took the initial medicine two or three times and gradually was able to eat porridge comfortably. Later, I used this method to treat over ten people, all with good results.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

I diagnosed him and said: &quot;Your energy at the mouth is large yet soft; this indicates a lack of food energy and an excess of medicinal energy. Furthermore, you have often taken pungent remedies, which can treat surface excess but not internal deficiency; they can resolve qi obstruction but cannot strengthen weak qi.&quot; I prescribed five qians of processed Pinellia, three qians of ginseng, one liang of aged rice, five spoonfuls of honey, boiled in sweet water. After two doses, his condition improved; after ten doses, he was stable.</p>
<p>In the summer, Sun Xiaoxiang from Tunyuan ate too many melons and fruits, which led to vomiting after each meal for ten days, causing great alarm in his family, who called for me from a thousand miles away. By the time I arrived at the office, it had already been twenty days. He was languid in bed, with hands and feet as cold as ice. I said: &quot;When I press on your abdomen, there is a response, and the stomach qi is faintly present. This is simply due to your weak middle energy being additionally harmed by cold.&quot; Thus, I used red bean pills and prescribed three doses; by the next day, he was able to eat porridge. I also prescribed the Regulating Middle Decoction with added clove and sandalwood.

She took drugs such as Qinfang and Lianhua, which increased her chills and fever, leading to dry mouth and excess saliva; when she ate winter melon, her vomiting worsened. I diagnosed her with deficiency and cold of the spleen. I quickly used salt, mugwort, and aconite to warm her navel and abdomen. I also instructed her son to breathe in her breath to restore her spirit slightly. I made pills from ginseng, atractylodes, aconite, and dried tangerine peel, about the size of millet, and advised her to take five to seven grains. The next day, I increased it to over ten grains and gradually provided her with one or two spoonfuls of decoction until she desired porridge.

<p>Tan Shiyu would always vomit clear water when suffering from headaches, regardless of winter or summer; ginger would help stop it.

I waited until he vomited clear water without sourness, noted the inch pulse gradually diminishing, and the cubit pulse returning to normal.

On the third day, she vomited sour substances; on the seventh day, sour yellow water; on the eleventh day, bitter water. Her pulse became increasingly vigorous, and she continued to crave cold water. I prepared a decoction with only yellow root and had her sip it cold. By the twentieth day, I added white atractylodes and white poria; by the twenty-fifth day, I added dried tangerine peel; by the thirty-seventh day, I added angelica and roasted licorice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chen Hu&#39;s mother had long suffered from abdominal pain, characterized by chest fullness, vomiting, fainting, a red face, numb lips, dry throat, and intermittent chills and fevers, with a large and forceful pulse. Many treated her for phlegm and fire, but it would frequently recur. In the spring of the Year of the Earth Snake, the fever became very intense, and the medication exacerbated the situation. A woman named Zhu Cunmo said it was due to the cold and cooling medicines, suggesting the use of ginseng and ginger preparations. They doubted any treatment would relieve the pain, so they requested my intervention for a compromise. I diagnosed her condition as a consequence of the cold damaging the genuine Qi, resulting in internal cold and external false heat. Furthermore, the pulse was string-like and forceful with strange characteristics, indicating a deficiency in the spleen Qi, allowing the liver pulse to overpower it. The only solution was to warm and tonify the stomach. I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and boost Qi, adding pinellia, poria, evodia, and costus. After one dose, she fell into a deep sleep through the night; the forceful pulse diminished, the strange pulse disappeared, and all symptoms were relieved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Door Laws&quot; states: Ni Qing suffered from a stagnation of Qi for fourteen days, unable to swallow even a grain of rice.

When I examined him, I assured that he could be saved. His family was skeptical. I said, &quot;If you manage to survive this day and night, first take six doses of the Lichong Decoction to prevent him from succumbing. Come back early for a new prescription; one dose will be entirely safe.&quot; They replied, &quot;The disease has progressed to this point; not even a drop of water can enter his throat. How can he take six doses of medicine?&quot; I replied, &quot;As long as you can get something warm and sweet into his mouth, he will be pleased and will take more, so do not worry too much.&quot; His children, whether scholars or soldiers, also understood the reason behind the treatment.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a></p></div>

In this case, there are two approaches for treatment: one uses black water for the stomach&#39;s fluids and foul water for the intestines. When this water is expelled, the fluids in the stomach have long since dissipated, so I do not dare to use Banxia to dry out the stomach. The other approach holds onto the remaining life force, replacing Daizhuo carefully, fearing a sudden halt. First, I must analyze and balance the principles of yin and yang; only then can Daizhuo achieve remarkable results. The deep insights of a moment can match those tested through the ages; why question further? Also, when considering Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s prescriptions, I see he uses stewed ginger instead of dried ginger, stating that dried ginger is even drier than Banxia, which is why he does not dare to use it.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a></p></div>

The disciples privately noted: when there is discourse that is grand yet not boastful, this gentleman is quite similar. Let us administer this medicine and observe its effects.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Hou&#39;s ancestor, due to overeating in the wind, suddenly vomited violently, exhausting his stomach&#39;s qi, and was subsequently summoned for a diagnosis. He described feeling slightly feverish, and the pulse at his left guan was notably strong. He stated that initially, his middle jiao felt uncomfortable, and now he felt qi rebelling towards the left. At first, he had used pear juice without effect, but now he tried sugarcane juice, which brought some relief, though he was unsure of the nature of his condition. Chang concluded: this is a symptom of empty wind. The food and drink consumed by the stomach have been entirely expelled, leaving it empty like a valley, giving rise to wind from within. Additionally, the long-stored wind in the intestines seizes the opportunity to rise, causing instability in the stomach. When wind enters the stomach, it must affect the liver (wood) on the left, leading to the rebelling qi on that side, which explains the strong and robust left pulse. The Inner Canon states: when wind is excessive within, it should be treated with sweet and cold (substances).<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Pear juice and cane syrup are both sweet and cool substances that interact differently with the body. One is effective while the other is not, indicating that the stomach&#39;s qi is extremely deficient. The body cannot tolerate the cold nature of the pear, yet prefers the harmonizing quality of the cane syrup. Therefore, a prescription involving sweet and cool medicines was established, including ginseng, bamboo juice, wheat, and raw rehmannia, but it was decided to omit ginseng. After taking the medicine, there were gurgling sounds in the abdomen, and a small amount of yellow phlegm was vomited, which brought relief to the chest. The following morning, bowel movements were also prompt, leading to an appearance of stability. However, there was something puzzling: Although the stomach meridian was sick, the stomach pulse did not show signs of illness. Rather, the pulses in the two sides—heart, kidney, liver, and lung—occasionally presented new issues, disrupting the norm. This led to discussions revealing that the issue wasn&#39;t merely in the associated side pulses but rather that the central qi was weak and unable to reach all areas, much like a mother unable to nurse her four children, thus exhibiting signs of hunger and deprivation. The elder stated that the taste in his mouth was extremely bland, and when water reached his throat, it flowed back, refusing to go down. It was evident that the qi in the stomach was not moving properly, and stagnant water blocked the throat, preventing the swallowing of new water.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is advisable to urgently use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to regulate the stomach qi, allowing the central pivot to turn, and facilitating the mechanisms all around. The water qi in the throat will not reverse, and the bland taste in the mouth will also be eliminated. If there is doubt, quickly consult an expert; it is not convenient to delay here and cause misfortune. However, overly intense statements may lead to accusations of intentional alarm, prompting the summoning of two physicians. Some claim it is a stroke, while others assert it is a chill, each having differing opinions. As for the use of ginseng, they harmonize in agreement, suggesting it is a mild and easily treatable condition, thus sharing the burden together. If slightly more medicine is administered to promote sweating, resulting in dampness, they would still commend it, without considering the exhausted stomach qi, which can lead to real difficulty, ultimately causing a spillover and loss of control. Consequently, the qi rises and the spirit becomes disturbed, causing persistent belching. Again, in a stroke of luck, using a dose of Huanglian may bring it to an end, adding extreme bitterness to hasten its conclusion.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The two physicians were caught off guard and called for Chang again, but by then the pulse had already become chaotic, boiling like soup, frequently fluctuating and pausing. The spirit was dulled and unresponsive, though the body remained strong and unmoving. In the years of life, there was a lump of stagnant darkness; as the vital energy exited, it could flow out smoothly, but upon entering, it was bound to cause coughing. Counting day and night, there were thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, leading to the same number of coughs. The two physicians, having evaded disaster, suggested to Chang that the Four Gentlemen Decoction they had discussed earlier could now be used. Alas! In matters of life and death, do we still strive for a luxurious banquet? To this, I responded: With the vital energy already expelled and not re-entering, and further hindered by the thick obstruction of ginseng and atractylodes, the prognosis was grim. The only prescription was the Reversed Cinnabar Decoction from Zhongjing, which could restore the spirit to a remarkable degree. After administering one dose, the coughing slightly decreased. A second dose, increasing the amount of cinnabar to five qian, significantly reduced the coughing. Continuously administering porridge, the spirit brightened, complexion improved, and the pulse returned to a lighter state. Over the next two days, additional doses of ginseng, poria, ophiopogon, papaya, and licorice were used to harmonize the body, leading to a complete recovery. This was perhaps because my grandfather, in his youth, was simple and unrefined, thus the resilience of pine and cypress would grow stronger with age; it was not solely due to the efficacy of medicine. Even when discussing the medicine, it was not just the ginseng&#39;s power, but the downward force of the cinnabar that propelled it.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

Local doctors were called, and they all insisted that immediate detoxification was necessary. They administered a combination of Huang Lian, black beans, Platycodon, licorice, and bitter orange, which only worsened the illness, leading to severe abdominal distension, shortness of breath, and an inability to retain any liquids. The situation became critical, and they sought my help. </p>
<p>I prescribed ginseng, white atractylodes, licorice, dry ginger, aconite, and poria among other herbs.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After one dose, the vomiting diminished; after another dose, the bloating lessened significantly. Therefore, I greatly increased the use of熟地黄 to support the deficiency caused by the diarrhea. In total, I administered over twenty doses, and the patient returned to normal. The patient then asked, &quot;I initially fell ill due to poisoning. My fellow villagers, attempting to detoxify, made the condition worse, while you, sir, treated without detoxifying and instead brought about a recovery. Why is that?&quot; I replied, &quot;Not all poisons are the same. Must one treat them only with things like Huang Lian, Gan, or Juzi?&quot; Take mushrooms, for instance; they grow only in deep pits, abandoned wells, or extremely cold and dark places, absorbing the most abundant yin energy, which makes them plump, white, and tender. Here, you have this cold-yin toxicity, and to counter it with the coldness of Huang Lian—what sense does that make? By using ginger and Fuzi, are we not combating the cold poison? By using ginseng and熟地, are we not countering the poison and replenishing vital energy? Thus, what they call detoxifying merely assists the poison; what I call not detoxifying actually serves to detoxify. The principle is quite clear, yet people cannot differentiate. Most erroneous treatments for ailments belong to this category. The patient bowed deeply, looking troubled, and sighed, &quot;If not for you, I might have become a spirit with grievances.&quot; I hope the teachings of this are preserved for future generations as a lesson.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The young woman of the Jin family was a daughter from an official family. She was naturally willful, often suffering from pain in her chest and sides, as well as nausea, which would resolve with adjustments. Later, at the end of autumn, her previous symptoms returned, and the vomiting worsened. After two days of this illness, she became faint and unresponsive, as though on the verge of death. </p>
<p>I was called to see her and observed several doctors surrounding her. They all agreed that her condition was such that she could not tolerate any medicinal soup or herbs; anything that entered her mouth would cause her to vomit, and there was no remedy available. One doctor suggested using a decoction of Ginseng, hoping it might save her life.</p>
<p>Upon examining her, I found her pulse chaotic and rapid, with signs of restlessness and heat that were hard to articulate. It did not seem like the fire of the Yangming channel; why was it so urgent? I then asked if she wanted cold water. She nodded in response, so I gave her half a cup, and to my surprise, she did not vomit this time, though she still seemed insufficient. I then gave her another cup, and she started to feel a little calmer.</p>
<p>Consequently, I administered the Taiqing decoction, despite my reluctance, thinking that this was not an ailment of cold damage, especially given the timing at the end of autumn; how could it endure? I did not argue, and after swallowing the medicine, she fell into a deep sleep for half a day and did not vomit anymore. Subsequently, I used nourishing yin and light clearing herbs to adjust her condition, leading to her recovery. </p>
<p>In general, recurrent vomiting often belongs to cold in the stomach, but when there are also signs of fire, as in this case, it aligns with the text: all reverse Qi surging upward belongs to fire. Thus, I have used this method to treat similar cases of vomiting that exhibit strong, violent surges and a rapid pulse along with persistent heat.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the Wang family, a young woman had not yet reached her twenties and had always enjoyed eating melons and cold fruits. However, she frequently suffered from abdominal pain, during which she would not eat for several days. After she reached her twenties, every onset was accompanied by vomiting roundworms. Initially, the vomiting was minimal, but later it increased day by day, with each episode involving twenty or more worms, and she would refrain from eating for ten days after each occurrence. Various doctors she consulted only knew how to attack the worms, causing them to disappear temporarily, but they would soon reappear, and none of the treatments were effective.</p>
<p>Upon examining her pulse and symptoms, I discerned the cause of her condition, realizing it stemmed from her consumption of cold foods, leading to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and accumulation of dampness. This was the reason for her symptoms. Unless she warmed and nurtured her spleen and stomach to eliminate the source of dampness, simply attacking the worms would not yield any lasting benefits. Consequently, I prepared a warming pill for her, and before she finished the medication, her condition improved.</p>
<p>Later, as she recovered, the young woman indulged in her desires and continued to eat raw fruits, causing her old ailment to return. I prepared the pills again for her, and this time she was completely cured. Observing these two cases, it was evident that in the previous case of the child, it was the cool medicines that harmed the spleen, leading to the development of worms; in the later case with the woman, it was the consumption of raw fruits that harmed the stomach, also resulting in worm growth. This illustrates that internal dampness and deficiency of the spleen and stomach are indeed the reasons for the development of worms. Therefore, in all methods of treating worms, one should focus primarily on warming and nourishing the spleen and stomach, provided there are no signs of malnutrition or heat.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a></p></div>

The Hand Greater Yin channel ascends to the diaphragm and is related to the lungs, which control breathing, thus resulting in the inability to breathe. With excessive fullness, rising and descending become difficult; without breath, the flow of qi is obstructed, leading to sighing and vomiting.

The prominence of the Shaoyang indicates that heat invades the stomach, prompting a desire to vomit, which is often acidic and accompanied by hunger. The energy of Shaoyang connects to the Sanjiao, hence the richness of heat in the stomach results in nausea and hunger; the source of the Sanjiao emanates from the stomach region. The recurrence of Jueyin involves vomiting where food cannot be ingested; it enters but quickly exits, and in severe cases affects the spleen, causing food stagnation and subsequent vomiting. The term \"recurrence\" refers to the clash of the three Yin and three Yang energies, where the prevailing energy obstructs, leading to a resurgence of symptoms. Vomiting and inability to retain food suggest that Wood excess disrupts Earth. The recurrence of Taiyin manifests through increased dampness, impeding the digestion of food, resulting in silent vomiting of clear liquid; in severe cases, it affects the kidneys, leading to unrestrained discharge.

Cold in the liver manifests as an inability to raise the arms, a dry tongue base, a tendency to sigh, chest pain, difficulty turning over, and vomiting upon eating, often accompanied by sweating.

The teacher replies: This is to induce sweating, allowing yang to slightly counteract, causing a deficiency in the qi.

The stomach receives food and drink, while the spleen governs transformation and transportation, producing blood and qi to regulate the entire body. If the spleen and stomach are unharmed, there will be no issue of vomiting. However, if there are disturbances such as improper diet—be it hot or cold, excessive consumption of raw or fatty foods, or exposure to dampness and wind—this can upset the stomach. Once the stomach is affected, spleen qi stagnates, causing a mix of clear and turbid substances, leading to blockages in the middle jiao and resulting in vomiting. This primarily addresses the issues arising from dietary excess and the effects of cold, wind, and dampness. Additionally, emotional distress can also harm the body, and if there is residual cold in the stomach, phlegm may accumulate, or evil heat may invade the stomach, causing blood stasis, all of which can lead to vomiting. One should assess these conditions carefully when faced with illness. **Vomiting** All sour vomit, rapid forced downward expulsion, falls under the category of heat. It flows without spoiling and moves without decay, hence the vomiting. Sour vomit occurs when there is significant heat in the stomach cavity, leading to qi stagnation; undigested substances become sour. Sourness corresponds to the flavor of the liver wood. Some claim sour vomiting indicates cold, which is a misconception. When heat is significant in the stomach cavity, it leads to vomiting, reflecting the ascent of fire energy. Sourness relates to the flavor of liver wood. Excessive fire can overpower metal, inhibiting the balance of wood, which leads the liver to become excessive and thus sour. Eating hot foods can easily lead to sourness as well. Those who interpret sour vomiting as a cold condition are mistaken."},{"anchor":"trans-29p","marker":"29p","type":"translation","text":"Just as the taste of wine is bitter and its nature is warming, it can nourish the heart's fire.

The vomit is sure to be sour, indicating clear heat. Moreover, when there is heat, all five flavors are rich. The classics state: \"On the earth, transformation occurs, giving rise to the five flavors, all belonging to the earth.\" Yet when earth is strong and victorious over water, it cannot control fire, thus fire grows excessively. Therefore, when the five flavors are heated and the food is rich, the flavors are also dense. Hence, when there is liver heat, the mouth feels sour; when there is heart heat, the mouth feels bitter; when there is spleen heat, the mouth feels sweet; when there is lung heat, the mouth feels pungent; when there is kidney heat, the mouth feels salty. If the mouth is bland, this indicates stomach heat. The stomach belongs to the earth, which is the mother of all things, making the stomach the foundation of the body, with blandness being the basis of the five flavors. Thus, is sour vomit not attributable to coldness? Those who incorrectly argue it results from cold merely claim it is due to excessive damage causing hard, sticky, slippery effects, or the damaging of cold substances, resulting in a preference for vinegary, sour ingestion.

Whenever there is internal injury from cold substances, it could either be that Yin exceeds Yang, causing a cold disease, or that cold and heat combat each other, leading to stagnant Yang energy in the intestines and stomach, resulting in heat. There are also cases where internal cold substances result in symptoms of heat; achieving a great sweat to release heat can lead to recovery and cooling of the body.

Vomiting foul substances occurs when the stomach and intestines are cold, resulting in improper transformation and transmission.

Foulness reflects the smell of metal.

Thus, regarding vomiting, we say that one feels a desire to vomit after consuming grains, and when vomiting occurs, it indicates that food and drink are immediately expelled, hence we can discern the severity of vomiting. In cases of febrile illnesses, vomiting can be attributed to heat or cold; however, scholars of vomiting all assert it's due to Yang deficiency. The classics state: \"In Yin disease, there is abdominal fullness and vomiting, inability to eat, with much benefit in self-care, occasionally the abdomen causes pain.\" It also states: \"There is internal cold in the stomach, hence the vomiting.\" However, the theorists on vomiting disagree. Vomiting can be caused by heat or cold, retained drink, or the presence of pus in the stomach; all must be clearly distinguished. Vomiting accompanied by fever signifies a condition where Chai Hu decoction is indicated, especially with persistent vomiting, anxiety beneath the heart, and mild irritation; thus, Da Chai Hu decoction is prescribed for those whose vomiting arises from evil heat. If there is cold drink obstructing the diaphragm causing dry retching, it should not be expelled but warmed; if the dry retching involves saliva and headaches, Wu Zhu Yu decoction is indicated, indicating that cold evil causes vomiting.

This vomiting is caused by the accumulation of pus in the stomach. Such cases, while they may differ, generally arise when the exterior evil of a cold disease tries to penetrate inward. If the internal energy rebels against this, vomiting results. Therefore, in cases where there is a combination of exterior and interior symptoms, vomiting is common. In a cold disease, after three days, the yang aspect is exhausted and the yin becomes susceptible to evil. If a person can eat without vomiting, it indicates that the yin is not affected by the evil. Thus, when the evil energy penetrates inward, vomiting is bound to occur. Regarding the symptoms associated with the decoction of dried ginger and aconite, if there is no vomiting and no thirst, it indicates that there is no heat in the interior. The symptoms of the Ten Dates Decoction indicate dry vomiting and shortness of breath, with sweating but no aversion to cold; this shows that the exterior has resolved while the interior has not been harmonized. From this perspective, the cause of vomiting can clearly be attributed to heat in the interior. In cases of vomiting, if the energy is rebellious, it must be dispersed; if phlegm and fluids are involved, they must be eliminated. The \"Essentials of the Thousand Gold\" states that those with vomiting often take fresh ginger, which is considered a holy medicine for this condition as it helps disperse the rebellious energy. The \"Classic of the Golden Chamber\" mentions that for those who vomit, banxia (Pinellia) is used to eliminate water; when the fluid is removed, the vomiting stops, indicating the need to expel phlegm and fluids. Even with abundant symptoms suggesting yangming (the Yangming channel), it is inappropriate to attack them, as the rebellious energy is causing accumulation. If vomiting is present along with a weak pulse, frequent urination, and mild fever with signs of apprehension, these conditions become difficult to treat, indicating severe deficiency and cold.

The answer is: the stomach governs comprehensively and has distinctions among the three channels of Taiyang, Yangming, and Shaoyang, based on the abundance or deficiency of Qi and blood, which affects the characteristics of sound and matter. Vomiting belongs to Taiyang, where there is matter but no sound, indicating a blood disease. If food enters, it leads to vomiting; if food is already present, it results in vomiting; if the duration is long, it continues to induce vomiting. Vomiting belongs to Yangming, characterized by both matter and sound, where Qi and blood are both affected. Zhang Zhongjing states: even if vomiting is frequent with Yangming evidence, one must not purge. Hiccups belong to Shaoyang, characterized by sound but no matter, indicating a Qi disease. ### On Vomiting In general, when there is sound and matter, it is called vomiting; when there is sound but no matter, it is called hiccuping. If there is heat in the stomach and phlegm in the diaphragm, the prescription is Er Chen Tang with stir-fried Gardenia, Huanglian, and fresh ginger. For those with chronic vomiting due to stomach deficiency and inability to digest food, use Ren Shen, fresh ginger, Huangqi, Baizhu, and Xiangfu. Generally, vomiting is chiefly governed by Banxia, Chenpi, and fresh ginger. Liu Hejian states that vomiting is due to rising fire qi; this is only one aspect. If there is phlegm in the middle jiao preventing food from descending, if there is Qi counterflow, if cold energy is stagnating at the stomach, if food is stagnating in the heart and lungs, leading to new food being expelled, or if there is both fire and phlegm in the stomach causing vomiting.

Long-term accumulation leads to heat generated within the moisture, thus creating a sour taste; how can it be anything but heat? If it accumulates for too long and cannot rise and expel, lying between the lungs and stomach, unable to rise or descend, and if there’s wind-cold on the surface, the internal heat becomes even more stagnant, and the sour taste pricks the heart. When the surface is warmed, and the pores open, taking warm fragrant decoctions may temporarily relieve it; how can it be anything but cold? When the \"Suwen\" refers to heat, it speaks of the root; Dongyuan refers to cold, speaking of the end. However, Dongyuan does not mention that wind-cold from outside causes the condition, asserting that it wants to drain the lung's essence, claiming that cold medicines cannot treat sourness. Instead, it uses gastric soothing decoction and modified Erchen decoction, both involving cloves, yet lacks a method to treat damp-heat accumulation, which does not align with the teachings.

Therefore, when discussing vomiting, it is said that there is a desire to vomit from food intake; and when discussing throwing up, it is said that food and drink enter and then are immediately vomited, thus indicating the severity of vomiting can be understood. Furthermore, it also says: heaving is commonly referred to as reverse coughing. I harbor doubts regarding this. Hence, I consulted Zhang Zhongjing’s \"Treatise on Cold Damage\" to verify and refine this statement. Zhang’s work mentions vomiting, throwing up, dry heaving, and heaving extensively, while reverse coughing is mentioned only twice. I therefore observe these distinctions collectively. Vomiting refers, as Dongyuan said, to sounds and substances expelled simultaneously. Throwing up refers to substances expelled without sound. As for dry heaving and heaving, both produce sounds without expelling substances. Dongyuan merely categorized these under heaving without discussing dry heaving. The distinction between dry heaving and heaving must lie somewhere; it is merely a matter of degree. Hence, Zhang Zhongjing speaks plainly of dry heaving, while regarding heaving he states: after sweating due to solar attack and fire exhaustion, prolonged conditions lead to delirium, and in severe cases to heaving."},{"anchor":"trans-39p","marker":"39p","type":"translation","text":"It is said: If a person with Yangming pattern wind has no bowel movement and is bloated with gas, they should not be treated. It is also said: Those who experience excessive vomiting and diarrhea, and are extremely weak with excessive sweating, may develop gas. Although there are cases that seem straightforward, when compared to dry vomiting, they are quite different. I have pondered this further: dry vomiting and gas are seen as one by Dong Yuan, but as two by Zhang Zhongjing. Viewed as one, they both involve a unique sound; viewed as two, dry vomiting is a slight form of gas, while gas is an extreme form of dry vomiting. Dry vomiting produces a light, short sound, whereas gas produces a heavy, long sound. Despite the distinctions of slight and extreme, they are fundamentally the same condition. Now, Cheng’s school considers vomiting as having sound and mixes it up with dry vomiting, and regards gas as a type of cough. This interpretation, I cannot accept. Zhang Zhongjing classifies them clearly: when both sound and material are present, it is called vomiting; when only material is expelled, it is called vomiting; and when only sound is heard, it is called dry vomiting. Because vomiting involves both sound and material, therefore, when there is sound without material, it is called dry (which means empty).

To speak of \"nausea exhausting the pus,\" can one really say it has a unique sound? Regarding cases where one experiences nausea with soup, food, or excessive drinking, it cannot be regarded as having a unique sound either. Moreover, in the discussion on Shaoyin disease, when using the method of Tongmai Sijue Decoction, it describes symptoms including dry heaving. Why then does the subsequent text in the adjustment methods say to add ginger for those who experience nausea? If Zhongjing truly considered nausea to have a unique sound, he would not have named it \"dry heaving.\" Observing the texts, when it explicitly mentions both nausea and dry heaving, it indicates that their meanings are distinct; is this not evident? Furthermore, Zhongjing has mentioned the desire to heave and the desire to vomit, but has never spoken of the desire for dry heaving or retching. The term \"desire\" pertains to something about to be expelled but has not yet done so, and it reflects a sensation of something tangible.

The act of vomiting and spitting concerns tangible substances, thus it may be called desire. Dry heaving and retching, concerning formless sounds, thus cannot be called desire. Cheng Shi cites the phrases about eating grain and wanting to vomit, and consuming food only to immediately spit it out, and he claims that vomiting and spitting have different weights. His intention is to ascribe lightness to desire as expressed in vomiting, while spitting is considered heavy in its immediate action. How can one know that desire is not merely expressed as 'want'—this set is primarily based on form and formlessness, not on weight distinctions? If it is as he says, then one with hot soup would vomit, one with food would also vomit, and when one feels a warm desire to vomit, the reverse urge to vomit would not originate from Zhongjing? He also cites popular usage of the term 'chew' to support his point about vomiting. However, 'chew' and 'retching' are different in writing but similar in sound and meaning; thus, using 'chew' to support vomiting is too shallow. Nonetheless, comparing vomiting and spitting, spitting is lighter than vomiting, and comparing spitting and dry heaving, dry heaving is lighter than spitting. However, each of these three has its own weight distinctions that cannot be firmly fixed. Yet, comparing vomiting, spitting, dry heaving, and retching, retching is indeed the heaviest, and cannot be compared to the other three.

Thus, if there is vomiting from the upper jiao, it arises from the interaction with qi. Qi is the yang of heaven, having a floating and surging pulse. The symptoms include vomiting soon after eating, thirst for water, constipation, and a sensation of uplift in the chest causing pain.

Knowing that the Yang condition had been resolved through sweating, it was appropriate to use cooling medications, as the vomiting was due to Yang symptoms, not a combination with the Yangming or Shaoyang; thus, the vomiting was caused by heat and warm medications were ineffective. I have also witnessed a case with significant vomiting from Yang symptoms; in such instances, it sufficed to release the exterior without using emetic herbs. Additionally, there was a case where upon onset of the illness, with clear Yang symptoms and vomiting, everyone in the household displaying similar symptoms responded effectively to eight doses of Stomach Nourishing Decoction. At that time, the movement of Qi naturally aligned this way, indicating a case of cold damage with miscellaneous diseases, which should not be treated according to the regular principles of cold damage.

Vomiting sourness occurs due to heat arising from dampness; swallowing sourness arises from internal deficiency and stagnation of heat.

Dongyuan sees gastric cold as addressing the root cause of the illness. For all who suffer from this, one should first distinguish between vomiting and swallowing, and the treatment should primarily focus on tonifying the root essence. If cold and cool herbs are used, they will further harm stomach qi, leading to a blend of true and false conditions. If the spleen qi is deficient and food and drink cannot be processed, resulting in turbidity not descending, then one should use Liu Jun Zi Decoction to primarily tonify the spleen and stomach, with a slight addition of Yue Ju Pills for clearing.

Vomiting (tui) belongs to the Taiyang category, characterized by abundant blood and little qi, hence it involves material (vomit) without sound; this indicates a blood issue. Hiccuping (huè) belongs to the Shaoyang category, defined by abundant qi and limited blood, resulting in sound without material; this is indicative of a qi issue. Dongyuan states that both vomiting and hiccuping arise from a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, either from the invasion of cold or from diet-related harm, leading to upwards reversal and an inability to retain food. The elder Jie Gu discusses three causes of qi accumulation due to cold: The upper jiao is located at the stomach area, communicates with celestial qi, and is responsible for receiving but not expelling; the middle jiao is at the center, connects to celestial qi above and terrestrial qi below, and governs the digestion of food; the lower jiao, beneath the navel, connects to terrestrial qi, and is responsible for expulsion rather than reception. Therefore, if vomiting occurs in the upper jiao, it is always caused by qi, which corresponds to the yang of heaven. Its pulse is superficial and strong. The symptoms often involve vomiting shortly after eating, with a thirst for water; treatment should focus on descending qi and harmonizing the center. For the middle jiao, vomiting is due to accumulation, with both yin and yang involved, where qi and food interact. Its pulse is superficial and wiry. Symptoms may involve pain preceding vomiting or vomiting preceding pain; the remedy should aim to eliminate accumulation and harmonize qi.

If vomiting occurs as soon as the food is swallowed, it is termed \"violent vomiting,\" meaning that the food is expelled immediately after being swallowed; use ginger and tangerine peel decoction. If vomiting occurs after eating is completed, it is referred to as \"vomiting,\" meaning that vomiting follows the completion of eating, and the remedy is tangerine peel and Banxia decoction.

However, both vomiting and expectoration involve matter being expelled; when compared, vomiting is more severe than expectoration. This is because a pathogenic influence strikes inward, causing the internal qi to rise counter to normal, hence the vomiting and the inability to retain water and food.

For example, in cases of vomiting, it relates to the Yangming channel, which has abundant blood and qi, thus resulting in both sound and substance; this indicates an illness of both qi and blood. Zhongjing stated: Even if there is much vomiting with Yangming symptoms, one must be cautious not to purge. Master Sun proclaimed that those who vomit often take fresh ginger, which is indeed the sacred remedy for vomiting. One must disperse the rebellious qi, thus using fresh ginger as the main ingredient. In cases of vomiting, it relates to the Taiyang channel, which has much blood but little qi, hence there is substance without sound; this indicates a blood illness. If food is ingested, then there will be vomiting; if food is already in the stomach, vomiting will occur, and dried tangerine peel can be used to relieve it. Belching relates to the Shaoyang channel, which has much qi and little blood, resulting in sound without substance; this indicates a qi illness, and the main remedy should be ginger combined with pinellia. Therefore, Zhu Feng suggested treating vomiting and belching with fresh ginger, pinellia, dried tangerine peel, and the like. Upon investigating the origins of these three ailments, they are all caused by weak spleen qi, or by cold invading the stomach, aggravated by dietary injuries. Hence, one should primarily use ingredients such as clove, patchouli, pinellia, poria, dried tangerine peel, and fresh ginger. If there has been pre-existing internal injury accompanied by these ailments, one should examine the deficiency and excess to resolve them internally.

It also states: For those who are prone to vomiting and originally felt thirst, but now do not, it is because there is a blockage below the heart due to fluid accumulation, which Xiaobansha Decoction addresses. The ingredients include one pound of Banxia, half a pound of fresh ginger, and seven liters of water, boiled down to one and a half liters and consumed warm in divided doses. It further states: For sudden vomiting, a sensation of fullness below the heart, fluid retention, and dizziness, the appropriate treatment is Xiaobansha Decoction plus Poria, which simply adds four taels of Poria to the previous formula. Both ginger and Banxia are effective primary agents for treating vomiting. However, for cases of obstruction in the upper burner due to excess, where the stomach is weak and the grain qi is not flowing, leading to chest blockage and vomiting, it is crucial to nourish the stomach and promote the flow of grain qi rather than using pungent herbs to drain it. Thus, if Xiaobansha Decoction does not yield results, switching to Dabanxia Decoction will provide immediate relief; this is the principle according to Zhongjing. Zhongjing states: If a patient wishes to vomit, one must not force them to do so. Additionally, using Da Huang and Gan Cao to treat vomiting immediately after eating—is this acceptable? It is because the desire to vomit indicates that the illness is located above, and it can be permitted to let it act. Conversely, forcing a downward motion would surely cause stagnation and increase confusion, thus it is prohibited. If one has vomited but is unable to stop and has rising symptoms without descending ones, one should allow the downward motion to occur without haste to use Da Huang, hence it is permitted.

The so-called pathogen may arise from sudden cold or heat illnesses, excessive stomach fire, reversed liver qi, phlegm or water accumulation in the chest, or exterior pathogens penetrating inward, gathering between the Shaoyang and Yangming; all lead to vomiting, which are the true pathogens of this condition. The so-called false conditions may arise without any internal damage or external afflictions, yet persistently lead to vomiting; since there is no pathogen, the stomach must be deficient. These can occur with slight cold exposure, minor exertion, mild dietary indiscretion, or slight liver qi reversal, all summing up to a deficiency of the stomach. In assessing vomiting's true and false conditions, stomach qi is paramount. If the stomach is strong and the spleen is healthy, then whatever food is ingested should be properly transformed, preventing vomiting. Thus, even with significant harm from cold, heat, hunger, or fullness, the stomach should not falter. However, if there is a slight stimulus and the person cannot withstand it, it is due to a weakness in stomach qi. This distinction between true and false conditions should be carefully evaluated to avoid the pitfalls of misdiagnosis. If the stomach qi is inherently deficient and there is stagnation, there exists a mix of deficiency and excess, necessitating initial purification before nourishment. If there is stagnation yet middle qi is weak and struggling, the urgency lies in addressing the deficiency first; one must prioritize restoring the original qi while also providing some purification."},{"anchor":"trans-71p","marker":"71p","type":"translation","text":"In this context, the principles of the beginning and the end are clearly established, emphasizing the importance of understanding the balance of factors. Although those who suffer from vomiting may appear to have a “fire symptom,” as detailed later, most instances of vomiting stem from coldness invading the stomach, with cold stomach conditions being prevalent. In contrast, internal heat is rare. Moreover, vomiting caused by external factors often involves significant cold evil, making the indiscriminate use of cold and cooling medicines inappropriate. If one mistakenly uses such treatments without genuine fire symptoms, those with strong stomachs might endure it, but those with weak stomachs will certainly suffer. Liu Hejian noted that intense heat in the stomach leads to vomiting, an assertion that may be an exaggeration; strict adherence to this could cause considerable harm. Additionally, Sun Zhenren asserted that the foremost remedy for vomiting is ginger, a more accurate view that surpasses Hejian’s. Zhong Jing stated that in cases of typhoid fever with abundant vomiting, even if there are symptoms of the yangming layer, it should not be purged. This mainly refers to typhoid fever. However, in my opinion, this applies not only to typhoid fever but to all conditions. Why? Because vomiting in mixed conditions is particularly unlike that in typhoid fever. In typhoid fever, there is still heat evil present, but if the heat is in the upper burner and not fully infiltrating the bowels, the resulting reversal means it should not be purged. In contrast, in mixed conditions, vomiting arises not only from a cold stomach but also from a deficiency of the spleen which fails to move. If both spleen and stomach are deficient, can one truly initiate a purging? Furthermore, while the pathogenic factors may not be connected between upper and lower body, the vital energy of both is indeed interdependent. This is precisely why vomiting cannot be purged; the concern is that if disease exists above and one purges below, the lower will become even weaker, and the upper will become increasingly burdened."},{"anchor":"trans-72p","marker":"72p","type":"translation","text":"**Deficiency Syndrome** In general, for those whose stomach is deficient and suffer from vomiting, the symptoms are varied, and one must discern accordingly.

If there is no internal heat or agitation, it is not a fire symptom. If there are no exterior cold or heat symptoms, it is not a superficial evil. If there is no food or heat yet one suddenly vomits, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If vomiting is inconsistent, occurring intermittently, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If food cannot settle and one vomits upon sensing food, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If there is no counterflow of qi and one feels nausea upon smelling, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If slight cold in the back or from eating and drinking leads to vomiting, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If there is sour burping or rancid belching, along with feelings of bitterness and nausea, persistent discomfort when swallowing cold, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If incorrect treatment for illness is administered, mistakenly using harsh cold remedies when there was no vomiting to begin with, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If one eats in the morning and vomits in the evening, or eats in the evening and vomits in the morning, with food entering the middle jiao and not being digested, it is a sign of stomach deficiency. If food enters the lower jiao and is not digested, it indicates a lack of yang in the earth element; thus, the life gate is deficient.

It is not to say that there are absolutely no cases of vomiting caused by heat; however, cases of vomiting due to heat are rare, while cases due to cold are common. Vomiting caused by a strong stomach is rare, while that caused by a weak stomach is frequent, hence the necessity for this distinction.

For those with a strong stomach, even toxic substances can be tolerated, regardless of their qualities. However, for a weak stomach, differentiation of suitable and unsuitable substances becomes essential. The more severe the stomach weakness, the more significant the relationship between substances' qualities and the condition. A weak stomach is highly sensitive to unmanageable qualities. Not only can it not tolerate strong, fishy, or foul odors, but even mild fragrances and ordinary food smells can be intolerable. The same goes for those who are aware of their condition. A weak stomach is particularly sensitive to flavors; it cannot withstand extreme bitterness or poor tastes, nor can it tolerate even mild saltiness or bitterness, along with the intrinsic tastes of grains. This highlights why vomiting from stomach deficiency is so impacted by flavors. If there is any slight mismatch, it can lead to immediate vomiting upon ingestion, which offers no benefit. Therefore, in treating symptoms like vomiting due to yang deficiency, all fragrant, salty, sour, and spicy flavors should be measured with personal discretion.

Suddenly, he passed dark blood in his stool, one or two bowls worth, and his pulse became weak and barely detectable, almost as if it would stop altogether. This was due to the vomiting harming his stomach qi and the extreme weakness of his spleen, compounded by the saline solution which caused blood to flow, preventing it from being retained in the body. I instructed him to immediately use ginseng and ginger to revive the vital energy that was on the verge of collapse, hoping it might help. Suddenly, another physician arrived and said, \"All rejections and upward pressures are related to heat. The blood in the stool is also due to heat; can we still use ginseng and ginger?

The causes of this condition can include cold, food stagnation, phlegm and fluids, foul Qi, fire pathogens, and dampness injuring the stomach, or other pathogens from maladies like cold, malaria, or dysentery affecting the stomach. To understand it better, one must discern between deficiency and excess, and between cold and heat.

Moreover, this condition is predominantly due to deficiency and cold, with at least eight or nine out of ten cases falling into this category. Even in cases of excess nausea, the spleen Qi is often weak and unable to properly transform food, leading to the symptoms.

Surely, one of these views must be erroneous, and I cannot refrain from voicing my stance that Dongyuan's perspective is correct while Hejian's is wrong. How can this be demonstrated? The reasoning from Hejian is actually rooted in the \"Inner Canon.\" The text states that all instances of sour vomiting, due to sudden force or pressure downwards, belong to heat. Thus, Hejian interprets all disease processes as resulting from fire, and harshly criticizes the stance that predominantly attributes this to cold.

For instance, when foods are hot, they easily lead to acidity. Some say that vomiting acid is due to cold, which is a mistake. Those who mistakenly claim it is cold merely suggest that excessive consumption can harden and create stickiness or damage cold substances, causing the phenomena of belching acid. Therefore, folk medicine focuses on temperate and harmonious treatments for the spleen and stomach. Little do they know that the classics say that when a person is harmed by cold, it manifests as a heat illness. Hence, any internal harm caused by cold substances could lead to an excess of yin over yang, resulting in illness due to cold, or the clash of cold and heat causing the stomach and intestines' yang energy to stagnate, leading to heat. There are also cases of internal harm from cold resulting in a rebound illness of heat, where profuse sweating and heat relief may occur, leading to recovery."},{"anchor":"trans-87p","marker":"87p","type":"translation","text":"If one has long been troubled by sourness and it does not cease, then it is inappropriate to warm it; instead, it is advisable to use cold medications to purge it, and later to adjust it with cooling medicines, leading to the resolution of heat and the harmonization of qi.

Observing what is said about the pathogenesis, it stems from fire to metal, from metal to wood, and from wood to the spleen, hence the sourness. If one speaks faintly in inquiry, it could indeed turn around; under such circumstances, pointing at a deer and calling it a horse would face no reproach. It is solely because they hold steadfastly to it being heat that they cannot help but twist and turn in explanation like this. However, if I say it is cold, it is not so. Sourness fundamentally belongs to the flavor of the liver wood. Why not say that the fire is weak and cannot generate earth, thus the spleen's qi is deficient and the liver's evil burdens it, resulting in sourness? Would this not be clearer in reasoning? Why then insist on such convoluted explanations? Furthermore, as the \"Inner Canon\" states, when a person is harmed by cold, it is considered a disease of heat; this refers to the injury of cold evils at the surface, leading to the fever of the three yangs, and when transmitted internally, it becomes the internal heat of yangming. Can it really be said that internal injuries from cold substances also represent disease heat? Is it plausible to think that one can resolve inner injuries from cold by sweating them out? Even for robust individuals, should they inadvertently be harmed by raw cold, lingering for a long time and accumulating into heat, this is a case of prolonged stagnation transforming into heat; could it truly be due to raw cold causing subsequent heat?

The stomach qi does not accept the external evil, resulting in vomiting. Zhongjing treated this with ginger and pinellia.

If the illness arises from heat attacking, this is a mistake. The essence of various illnesses is related to the heart being affected, with turbid energy not descending, resulting in a fullness in the center. Can cold medicine treat this? This is the argument of Dongyuan, which I believe is most reasonable. However, the way he articulates it can be too obscure; terms like \"gathering energy\" and \"the west's metal being strong, water as the child of metal\" may not be easily understood, and many often overlook them. Even in Danxi’s teachings, he also mentions that Dongyuan does not speak of external wind and cold but establishes the idea of gathering energy to drain the fullness of lung metal. He further argues that cold medicine cannot treat sourness, yet employs Anwei Decoction and the modified Erchen Decoction, both containing clove, while lacking methods for treating damp-heat accumulation. This does not align with the classic understanding.

However, when using Qinnian to treat acid reflux, one must discern carefully. Therefore, I will elaborate on Dongyuan's theories. The so-called \"gathering of qi\" refers to the metal qi, or autumn qi. The \"Inner Canon\" states: \"Autumn qi begins above.\" This indicates that the gradual increase of yin must start above, as the yang qi is about to retreat. The gradual onset of cold must begin above as well, as the yang qi declines. When it is said that the metal is strong, it does not mean the fullness of lung qi; it actually refers to an excess of cold qi. The saying that the son envelops the mother implies that with cold in the upper burner, the gathering of qi becomes more intense. Thus, using warm and hot remedies to drain the son is merely a suitable way to support yang and suppress yin. If Danxi did not grasp this intention and instead criticized it, what is the reason? For instance, cloves possess a spicy and refreshing flavor without toxicity; they are most appropriate for addressing cold stagnation in the middle burner, where qi is not flowing smoothly. How could one warn against them as if they are dangerous and instill fear in future generations? Danxi only understood that cloves should not be treated harshly, yet he did not realize the roles of Huanglian and Huangqin.

All these theories sound credible, but insisting that people do not accept them is impossible. In matters of this nature, they are often mistaken. It’s like an archer who claims to be skilled simply by not deviating from front, back, or sides. They do not realize that even such basic errors are enough to question their skill in archery. The various theories about this are very much the same. How can we know? One must examine patients by reasoning; reasoning must be based on truth. Just as the sourness of food seems to stem from heat, it appears plausible, yet when food is in a pot, if it can transform without becoming sour, it is because the heat is strong and quickly changes it without leaving anything behind. However, if placed in a vessel, it will take a long time to sour; this is due to accumulation and does not arise from heat. I have often seen water that has been cold and stagnant for a long time, which inevitably becomes sour. Is this due to heat? No, it’s due to inactivity. Furthermore, when winemaking is concerned, heat leading to sourness seems plausible. However, it is only after two or three days of fermentation, when the accumulated heat dissipates, that it becomes sour. There has never been a case where heat immediately causes sourness.

Therefore, how can the transformation in a wine vessel be as swift as the energy in the stomach, and how can the strength of stomach energy be compared to the slowness of a wine vessel? This is a matter of nature and reasoning; it is not merely a matter of tenfold, and there is no need for further clarification. Moreover, the leftover food in the stomach values quick transformation. If the yang energy in the stomach does not decline and operates healthily as usual, why would there be any sourness? If the firepower is insufficient, then the transformation must be slow. Once the transformation is delayed, food accumulates and cannot move, leading to sourness and rotting; this sourness is a gradual onset of spoilage. Thus, any illnesses characterized by sour stomach discomfort are often seen when food does not move quickly, resulting in discomfort from self-consumption, and will inevitably lead to fullness, stifling, and diarrhea. Could it not be the weakness of the spleen and yang deficiency in the stomach, yet still be misinterpreted as heat? I once encountered a gentleman in the capital who suffered from this and sought treatment from me; I told him it was cold, yet he persisted in believing it was heat, adhering to the winemaking argument, unable to differentiate, and ultimately fell victim to the likes of qinlian, never coming to understand. Is this not a case of misunderstanding from earlier discussions? It is indeed lamentable! Thus, I say: it is vital for one to discern truth and reason. If one grasps false reasoning and stubbornly clings to misplaced doubts, leading to major harm, it is nothing but this sort of case."},{"anchor":"trans-93p","marker":"93p","type":"translation","text":"This may seem like valid discourse, but it must not go unexamined. There are three types of experiencing acidity: First, when there is belching with sour water like vinegar effervescing in the throat, accompanied by discomfort in the heart (chest), this is known as \"swallowing acid,\" commonly referred to as \"having acidity.\" This condition is located at the highest point of the upper abdomen, where sourness often appears, causing unease. Second, it is not as close to \"swallowing acid.\" It is situated between the middle and upper parts of the stomach; often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, with everything expelled being sour, this is called \"vomiting acid,\" typically involving excessive moisture that fails to resolve."},{"anchor":"trans-94p","marker":"94p","type":"translation","text":"Furthermore, regarding the secondary issues, there is fundamentally no evidence for sour vomiting or sour regurgitation; these may arise incidentally due to vomiting, whether sour or bitter, along with various intolerable flavors. All of these are caused by phlegm and fluid accumulation in the stomach and intestines, leading to foul or turbid tastes, especially below the middle burner (Zhongwan). If the movement is downward, it goes unnoticed by people; if it rises, it is difficult to endure at the throat and mouth. Concerning these three conditions, those in the upper and middle burners are simply due to deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, which are unable to process properly; treatment for this must involve warming. As for those occasionally arising in the lower burner, there may be both cold and heat present, but treatment should be based on the symptoms of vomiting; once vomiting ceases, sour and bitter flavors will no longer be present. Nevertheless, this is merely my analysis, and I cannot help but approach the matter delicately. In practical terms, those with strong stomachs have no time to dwell on sourness and bitterness; if these sensations occur, it must be because of stagnation and blockage. This should be carefully examined according to the symptoms. If there are no signs of heat or a heated pulse to rely on, and one insists on the idea of heat arising from dampness without distinguishing between strength and weakness, then solely using coldness and cooling methods has led to many errors."},{"anchor":"trans-95p","marker":"95p","type":"translation","text":"**On Treatment** For the condition of sourness in the stomach, one must discern the subtle differences between excess and deficiency, as well as the vigor of youth versus the frailty of age. In cases of excess, the symptom can be treated; in cases of deficiency, the root must be addressed. If the stomach qi is not weak and the constitution is strong, and there are occasional accumulations causing sourness due to either cold or food, one should use warming and moving remedies such as Erchen Decoction, Pingwei Powder, or Hewei Decoction to treat the symptoms. If there is slight cold in the middle qi, one should modify Erchen Decoction or use Orange Peel Decoction; in severe cases, Warm Stomach Decoction is advisable. If there is a slight deficiency of qi, use Huoxiang Anwei Powder. These are all methods to treat the symptoms."},{"anchor":"trans-96p","marker":"96p","type":"translation","text":"When the spleen and stomach are deficient in qi, especially in middle age as one becomes gradually weaker, leading to reduced food intake and occasional sour belching, it is best to gently tonify the spleen and stomach. This can be done with formulas like Lizhong Decoction, Wengui Decoction, or Shengjiang Decoction; one must definitely avoid using cooling and depleting medications. If the deficiency is in the yin aspect and the lower burner is not warm, causing water pathogens to rise and create sourness, it is most effective to use the Recipe for Nourishing Yin. Danxi said: To treat sourness, one must use Wu Zhu Yu, following its nature to counter it, which is indeed a method of correction. However, it is not merely about following its nature. Its nature is warm and it is most effective in warming the middle and lower burners; its taste, being pungent and bitter, is best at overcoming the sour and heavy flavors. To call it a corrective method is an exaggeration. Using Huang Lian as the sovereign herb to treat sour vomiting is indeed Danxi's method. Observing his case studies, there was a patient who had sour lumps rising from the chest straight to the throat, which was very severe. By making a strong decoction of Huang Lian and cooling it before giving it to address the sour lump, just a few drops caused it to descend. The bitter taste sinks down, so when the sourness encounters bitterness, it immediately descends. This is also a method of calming boiling water with soup."},{"anchor":"trans-97p","marker":"97p","type":"translation","text":"If a young person is strong and has some reserves, and due to alcohol consumption feels a rising acidity and distress, they may use this method without immediately harming their stomach’s energy.

However, if one's energy is slightly weak, especially in those who have internal injuries or are older and suffer from acid reflux, one must avoid recklessly using Qinyin, as it further depletes the Yang energy. While it may provide temporary relief from bitter regurgitation, it ultimately damages stomach energy, and the condition will worsen with no recourse. For vomiting clear fluids, the traditional methods using Erzhong, Erchen Decoction, or Liu Junzi Decoction are all proper treatments. Yet, I have treated those suffering from water regurgitation by using the method of managing the Yin and simmering it, and the results are remarkably effective. Therefore, all three approaches should be considered for use."},{"anchor":"trans-98p","marker":"98p","type":"translation","text":"When the skin is exposed to wind and cold, it often leads to symptoms of sourness upon swallowing. This occurs because the breath (qi) enters through the nose, and through the meridians, it connects the internal organs to the back. Therefore, once cold enters the body, the yang and harmonious qi in the stomach is suppressed and unable to circulate freely, resulting in stagnation and the immediate sensation of sourness, which clearly indicates that cold evil has invaded the stomach. Currently, those who spread misinformation claim that when the skin is exposed to wind and cold, internal heat becomes more agitated, and the sour taste pricks the heart—a gross misunderstanding! The development of internal heat due to stagnation must occur gradually over time, whether one day or two, leading to stagnation and then heat. However, anyone who experiences cold and sourness does so immediately; how could it turn into agitated heat so quickly? It is precisely because it is not heat that the remedy involves warming the skin and using fragrant, drying medicines, which are the appropriate treatments for cold. Yet, those who insist on interpreting this as heat forcefully rationalize it. This illustrates the notion of seeking distant truths while ignoring nearby realities; all such misconceptions belong to this category."},{"anchor":"trans-99p","marker":"99p","type":"translation","text":"The symptoms of vomiting are often attributed to a deficiency of the stomach, but they are actually caused by a deficiency of the kidneys. Regardless of whether food is ingested and immediately expelled, it reflects the decline of the kidneys. All instances of vomiting are fundamentally due to kidney deficiency. Thus, treating vomiting without addressing the kidneys fails to address the root of the illness. The formula consists of three qian of ginseng, five qian each of white atracary, job’s tears, and foxnut, three grains of amomum, and five fen of wuzhuyu, to be decocted and taken. This formula appears to be a remedy for the spleen and stomach, but it is, in fact, a treatment for the kidneys. Aside from ginseng, which supports the stomach, all other ingredients enter the kidney channel and do not simply remain in the spleen. Kidney fire nourishes the spleen, allowing the spleen’s earth to generate the stomach; when the stomach qi transforms, vomiting and nausea begin to settle. This is a treatment for the stomach using kidney remedies—does anyone realize this? Furthermore, in cases of severe vomiting where the tongue resembles a thorn and both eyes are red and swollen, people tend to think it is due to heat, not knowing that it is actually due to the dryness of kidney water, causing fire not to be contained and water not to moisten—resulting in immediate expulsion of food. The appropriate method is to use a decoction of Liuwei Dihuang Tang, allowing ample drinking, which will diminish the excess heat and enable food and drink to be ingested. The stomach serves as the gate of the kidneys; the fire in the stomach must depend on the water from the kidneys to moisten it. If kidney water is depleted and cannot ascend to moisten the spleen and stomach, then stomach fire will boil, surging upwards to cause red and swollen eyes and a thorn-like tongue. However, this condition can be both restless and calm—at times longing for water, but when water is offered, there is reluctance to drink. Even when compelled to drink, it doesn’t bring much relief. This indicates a false heat above and true cold below. It is advisable to add fuzi and cinnamon to the Liuwei Tang, decocting it cold for consumption to address the source of the illness."},{"anchor":"trans-100p","marker":"100p","type":"translation","text":"Why is it that nowadays only Liu Wei Di Huang Tang is used?

It would be better to use Liu Wei Di Huang Tang directly aimed at the kidney palace, which, although passing through the stomach, does not cause conflict; it is like extinguishing the fire by using an indirect route, where the stomach becomes balanced without direct treatment. This is also a method of reverse treatment. For a person with severe vomiting, treatment should not be delayed. The method should employ five qian of ginseng, three qian each of poria and white atractylodes, three fen of licorice, one qian of dried tangerine peel, and three grains of cardamom seeds, boiled in water for consumption.

It is not understood that the energy of the spleen and stomach must be strong for fluids to be generated. If one simply uses moistening medicines, the spleen and stomach, which dislike dampness, will be harmed, thereby injuring their genuine energy. This is why drying medicines are used instead. Other organs may dislike dryness, but the spleen and stomach specifically dislike dampness and prefer dryness. By using ginseng and white atractylodes, one addresses what they need without the fear of excessive dryness. After a great purge, if there is cold evil directly entering the kidney palace, and the water from the spleen and stomach is entirely expelled, causing extremities to become cold and abdominal pain unbearable, one must use something hot to provide slight relief; otherwise, the chill may be fatal. Therefore, use one piece of aconite, four ounces of white atractylodes, one pennyweight of cinnamon, three pennyweights of dried ginger, and three ounces of ginseng to rescue them. Once swallowed, relief will be felt; if the vomiting settles, then all will return to normal. The water of the kidneys nourishes a person; how can it counteract the heart to cause death?

This is the reason why this formula is both dominant and remarkable. In cases of significant vomiting, it is clear that there is a deficiency of cold, and using multiple liang of ginseng is beneficial. However, vomiting should not be uniformly treated; if the condition is not urgent, it is acceptable to use less and gradually increase the dosage. If the cold is not severe and the vomiting is mild, then adding a couple of liang of ginseng might lead to an increase in fullness. While significant vomiting predominantly results from cold deficiency, there are also cases of vomiting due to heat, which cannot be overlooked. In cases of heat-induced vomiting, it must be accompanied by phlegm, unlike cold vomiting, which is purely clear water.

Hence, ginseng can be used temporarily but should not be taken continuously. Vomiting is a condition that arises quickly and is a minor ailment. However, if the stomach is tilted and vomits, it will inevitably harm the stomach qi, and once the stomach qi is damaged, it often leads to severe consequences. The symptoms may be caused by heat or cold; for heat-induced vomiting, one should clear the heat but must not suppress it. For cold-induced vomiting, one should dispel the cold but must not suppress it.

This remedy clears heat and reduces fever, thus stopping the vomiting on its own. Its effectiveness lies in Poria's ability to dissipate fire's influence, gently directing the heat downwards rather than forcefully expelling it. Moreover, Ginseng supports the stomach's energy, allowing it to counteract the presence of water naturally, making it unnecessary to deliberately stop the vomiting. Adding Sand Ginger also aids in halting nausea, which is why a single dose is sufficient to stop the vomiting. The second treats cold-related vomiting, called the Disperse Cold and Stop Vomiting Decoction. It contains two taels of Bai Zhu, five qian of Ginseng, one qian each of Fu Zi and Gan Jiang, and three fen of Clove, decocted in water and taken orally.

He felt heavy in his limbs, had no appetite, was lethargic and talkative, his tongue had no taste, experienced abdominal pain, and had headaches along with nausea. A physician prescribed Tongsheng San in large doses, covered him with thick clothing, and as a result, he sweated profusely; however, the earlier symptoms did not improve but worsened instead. He consulted several doctors, but after four months, he remained unhealed. I was summoned to Yan and ordered to treat him. Upon examination, I found the six pulses to be deep, thin, and slightly string-like. He had no desire to eat, and if he did eat, he would vomit. His middle qi was not balanced, stagnating in its ascent and descent, his mouth and tongue were dry, he experienced dizziness in the head and eyes, felt tired in his limbs, and his ankles were cold; he did not wish to get out of bed. The Prime Minister had never consumed alcohol, had a naturally lean physique, and due to the internal injuries from self-indulgence, along with excessive sweating, he was severely drained of bodily fluids, causing his spleen and stomach to become even more deficient, unable to nourish the myriad channels throughout the body, leading to his condition. Without warm, sweet, and spicy medicinal ingredients, it would be impossible to nurture his qi. The classics state: \"The spleen needs to be eased; urgently eat something sweet to relax it.\" Additionally, if the spleen is insufficient, it should be supplemented with sweetness. Huangqi and Renshen, which are sweet, nourish the spleen and stabilize the center, thus are used as the main ingredients.

Wheat bran relaxes the stomach and harmonizes digestion, while medicinal yeast, being hot and pungent, helps to eliminate stagnation and aid digestion. The above ingredients should be chewed and decocted in water for consumption. Vomiting stops, appetite increases, and the previous symptoms will resolve in three days. Those attending said: Although the previous symptoms have disappeared, why haven’t we had a bowel movement in nine days? I replied: The Prime Minister is older and weaker, has both sweat and urination, and suffers from insufficient spleen-stomach energy; the vital qi is deficient and fluids are not nourishing. How could one dare use cold and toxic medicines to purge him? Zhang Zhongjing said: After excessive sweating, if urination increases and stool becomes hard, one must not use the Chengqi Decoction. Even if there is internal stagnation, honey decoction should be used to guide it out. Shortly thereafter, more than twenty hardened stools were expelled, and he felt relief in his abdomen, with regulated qi flow. After taking the same medicine, he was delighted to eat, but if there were any adverse reactions, he should consume pills with orange peel and atractylodes for digestion. After a month, his illness had stabilized. The Prime Minister inquired: Since the illness is gone, what medicine should I take to prevent its recurrence? I replied: No, simply be cautious with your words, moderate your diet, and do not take medicine. Using medicine is akin to administering punishment; if the people have sinned, they are punished; if the body is ill, it is treated with medicine.

Many treated her for phlegm and fire, but it would frequently recur. In the spring of the Year of the Earth Snake, the fever became very intense, and the medication exacerbated the situation. A woman named Zhu Cunmo said it was due to the cold and cooling medicines, suggesting the use of ginseng and ginger preparations. They doubted any treatment would relieve the pain, so they requested my intervention for a compromise. I diagnosed her condition as a consequence of the cold damaging the genuine Qi, resulting in internal cold and external false heat. Furthermore, the pulse was string-like and forceful with strange characteristics, indicating a deficiency in the spleen Qi, allowing the liver pulse to overpower it. The only solution was to warm and tonify the stomach. I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and boost Qi, adding pinellia, poria, evodia, and costus. After one dose, she fell into a deep sleep through the night; the forceful pulse diminished, the strange pulse disappeared, and all symptoms were relieved. The \"Medical Door Laws\" states: Ni Qing suffered from a stagnation of Qi for fourteen days, unable to swallow even a grain of rice. He started by vomiting clear water, followed by green water, then black water, and finally foul-smelling water, nearing the point of suffocation. The doctor had given up on treatment. When I examined him, I assured that he could be saved. His family was skeptical. I said, \"If you manage to survive this day and night, first take six doses of the Lichong Decoction to prevent him from succumbing. Come back early for a new prescription; one dose will be entirely safe.\" They replied, \"The disease has progressed to this point; not even a drop of water can enter his throat. How can he take six doses of medicine?\" I replied, \"As long as you can get something warm and sweet into his mouth, he will be pleased and will take more, so do not worry too much.\" His children, whether scholars or soldiers, also understood the reason behind the treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-170p","marker":"170p","type":"translation","text":"Everyone said: Since there is a wonderful prescription, why not use it immediately to see the effects?

In this case, there are two approaches for treatment: one uses black water for the stomach's fluids and foul water for the intestines. When this water is expelled, the fluids in the stomach have long since dissipated, so I do not dare to use Banxia to dry out the stomach. The other approach holds onto the remaining life force, replacing Daizhuo carefully, fearing a sudden halt. First, I must analyze and balance the principles of yin and yang; only then can Daizhuo achieve remarkable results. The deep insights of a moment can match those tested through the ages; why question further?

After administration, I asked for more medicine. After two doses, the patient could speak, saying the internal energy was slightly connecting. But fearing it was too rushed, we decided to wait until dawn to take more; the following morning, the decision to proceed would be more prudent.

As soon as he took a sip, the patient exclaimed: \"What a good medicine! My Qi has already turned to the Dan Tian, but I fear this medicine is hard to come by.\" I replied, \"It's easy to find.\" The patient, for fourteen days, did not loosen his clothes. His eyes did not close for a moment and he was extremely exhausted. Attempting to remove his clothes to rest, a touch of cold air made him vomit, and the previous medicine was halted. He thought of congee and requested half a cup; he was very hungry and ended up eating two cups; shortly after, he had eaten six cups.

At first, he had used pear juice without effect, but now he tried sugarcane juice, which brought some relief, though he was unsure of the nature of his condition. Chang concluded: this is a symptom of empty wind. The food and drink consumed by the stomach have been entirely expelled, leaving it empty like a valley, giving rise to wind from within. Additionally, the long-stored wind in the intestines seizes the opportunity to rise, causing instability in the stomach. When wind enters the stomach, it must affect the liver (wood) on the left, leading to the rebelling qi on that side, which explains the strong and robust left pulse. The Inner Canon states: when wind is excessive within, it should be treated with sweet and cold (substances)."},{"anchor":"trans-174p","marker":"174p","type":"translation","text":"Pear juice and cane syrup are both sweet and cool substances that interact differently with the body. One is effective while the other is not, indicating that the stomach's qi is extremely deficient.

Therefore, a prescription involving sweet and cool medicines was established, including ginseng, bamboo juice, wheat, and raw rehmannia, but it was decided to omit ginseng. After taking the medicine, there were gurgling sounds in the abdomen, and a small amount of yellow phlegm was vomited, which brought relief to the chest. The following morning, bowel movements were also prompt, leading to an appearance of stability. However, there was something puzzling: Although the stomach meridian was sick, the stomach pulse did not show signs of illness. Rather, the pulses in the two sides—heart, kidney, liver, and lung—occasionally presented new issues, disrupting the norm. This led to discussions revealing that the issue wasn't merely in the associated side pulses but rather that the central qi was weak and unable to reach all areas, much like a mother unable to nurse her four children, thus exhibiting signs of hunger and deprivation. The elder stated that the taste in his mouth was extremely bland, and when water reached his throat, it flowed back, refusing to go down.

However, overly intense statements may lead to accusations of intentional alarm, prompting the summoning of two physicians. Some claim it is a stroke, while others assert it is a chill, each having differing opinions. As for the use of ginseng, they harmonize in agreement, suggesting it is a mild and easily treatable condition, thus sharing the burden together. If slightly more medicine is administered to promote sweating, resulting in dampness, they would still commend it, without considering the exhausted stomach qi, which can lead to real difficulty, ultimately causing a spillover and loss of control. Consequently, the qi rises and the spirit becomes disturbed, causing persistent belching.

Counting day and night, there were thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, leading to the same number of coughs. The two physicians, having evaded disaster, suggested to Chang that the Four Gentlemen Decoction they had discussed earlier could now be used. Alas! In matters of life and death, do we still strive for a luxurious banquet? To this, I responded: With the vital energy already expelled and not re-entering, and further hindered by the thick obstruction of ginseng and atractylodes, the prognosis was grim. The only prescription was the Reversed Cinnabar Decoction from Zhongjing, which could restore the spirit to a remarkable degree. After administering one dose, the coughing slightly decreased. A second dose, increasing the amount of cinnabar to five qian, significantly reduced the coughing. Continuously administering porridge, the spirit brightened, complexion improved, and the pulse returned to a lighter state. Over the next two days, additional doses of ginseng, poria, ophiopogon, papaya, and licorice were used to harmonize the body, leading to a complete recovery. This was perhaps because my grandfather, in his youth, was simple and unrefined, thus the resilience of pine and cypress would grow stronger with age; it was not solely due to the efficacy of medicine.

Upon seeing fresh mushrooms that were plump and appetizing, I asked the cook to make a soup from them, which resulted in severe vomiting and diarrhea. Local doctors were called, and they all insisted that immediate detoxification was necessary. They administered a combination of Huang Lian, black beans, Platycodon, licorice, and bitter orange, which only worsened the illness, leading to severe abdominal distension, shortness of breath, and an inability to retain any liquids. The situation became critical, and they sought my help. I prescribed ginseng, white atractylodes, licorice, dry ginger, aconite, and poria among other herbs. However, he was hesitant to use them, saying: \"With such abdominal distension and urgent breathing, how can I dare take this medicine again?\" He decided to stop for a day, and his condition worsened to the point of being life-threatening.

My fellow villagers, attempting to detoxify, made the condition worse, while you, sir, treated without detoxifying and instead brought about a recovery. Why is that?\" I replied, \"Not all poisons are the same. Must one treat them only with things like Huang Lian, Gan, or Juzi?\" Take mushrooms, for instance; they grow only in deep pits, abandoned wells, or extremely cold and dark places, absorbing the most abundant yin energy, which makes them plump, white, and tender. Here, you have this cold-yin toxicity, and to counter it with the coldness of Huang Lian—what sense does that make? By using ginger and Fuzi, are we not combating the cold poison? By using ginseng and熟地, are we not countering the poison and replenishing vital energy? Thus, what they call detoxifying merely assists the poison; what I call not detoxifying actually serves to detoxify. The principle is quite clear, yet people cannot differentiate.

I was called to see her and observed several doctors surrounding her. They all agreed that her condition was such that she could not tolerate any medicinal soup or herbs; anything that entered her mouth would cause her to vomit, and there was no remedy available. One doctor suggested using a decoction of Ginseng, hoping it might save her life. Upon examining her, I found her pulse chaotic and rapid, with signs of restlessness and heat that were hard to articulate. It did not seem like the fire of the Yangming channel; why was it so urgent? I then asked if she wanted cold water. She nodded in response, so I gave her half a cup, and to my surprise, she did not vomit this time, though she still seemed insufficient.

I did not argue, and after swallowing the medicine, she fell into a deep sleep for half a day and did not vomit anymore. Subsequently, I used nourishing yin and light clearing herbs to adjust her condition, leading to her recovery.

Various doctors she consulted only knew how to attack the worms, causing them to disappear temporarily, but they would soon reappear, and none of the treatments were effective. Upon examining her pulse and symptoms, I discerned the cause of her condition, realizing it stemmed from her consumption of cold foods, leading to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and accumulation of dampness. This was the reason for her symptoms. Unless she warmed and nurtured her spleen and stomach to eliminate the source of dampness, simply attacking the worms would not yield any lasting benefits. Consequently, I prepared a warming pill for her, and before she finished the medication, her condition improved. Later, as she recovered, the young woman indulged in her desires and continued to eat raw fruits, causing her old ailment to return. I prepared the pills again for her, and this time she was completely cured. Observing these two cases, it was evident that in the previous case of the child, it was the cool medicines that harmed the spleen, leading to the development of worms; in the later case with the woman, it was the consumption of raw fruits that harmed the stomach, also resulting in worm growth.
