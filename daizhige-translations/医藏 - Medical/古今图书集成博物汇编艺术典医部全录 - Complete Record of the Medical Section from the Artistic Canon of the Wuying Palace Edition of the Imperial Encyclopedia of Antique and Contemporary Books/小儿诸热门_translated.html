<p><strong>On Common Pediatric Conditions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huang Di&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Real and Unreal Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: If an infant is ill with heat and has a faint pulse, what should be done?<br>[Note: Those who are ill with heat are generally suffering from conditions related to cold. When one is harmed by cold, they borrow the yang energy to transform the heat; although the heat is intense, it does not lead to death. Yet, the yang energy arises from the essence of water; for boys, this begins at eight years old, and for girls, seven years old, when the kidney energy starts to be substantial. Infants have not reached the stage of menses, and their kidney energy is not strong, hence the Emperor poses this question. The heart governs the pulse and depends on the kidneys for vitality. The energies of water and fire circulate between the heart and the kidneys; when kidney energy cannot support the heart, the heart feels as if it is starving, and the pulse at the wrist becomes faint and weak, indicating the kidney energy is still insufficient.]<br>Qi Bo said: If the hands and feet are warm, one thrives; if they are cold, one perishes.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>【Note: The vitality of a newborn is attributed to the post-natal energy. All limbs derive their energy from the stomach; therefore, when the energy at the extremities is warm, the stomach&#39;s energy is still strong, leading to life. When cold, the stomach&#39;s energy is depleted, resulting in death. When food and drink enter the stomach, bodily fluids follow their respective pathways. The kidneys are the water organ, absorbing the essences of the five organs and storing them, being the essence from pre-natal sources, which is also supplemented by post-natal resources. Furthermore, it differentiates and produces two pathways of nourishment and defense. The great energy that stagnates and does not circulate is called ancestral energy, accumulating in the chest, rising to the lungs to assist with respiration, being the source of vitality for the limbs. Therefore, if the extremities are warm, it indicates life; if cold, it indicates death.】</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What is the pulse like for an infant with wind-heat, wheezing, and shoulder breathing?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;For wheezing and shoulder breathing, the pulse is full and strong. A relaxed pulse indicates life, while a rapid pulse indicates death.&quot; </p>
<p>【Note: This again discusses the importance of the ancestral energy generated after birth, which should not be harmed. Ancestral energy is foundational to the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians, hence its name. Shoulder breathing refers to breathing that causes the shoulders to rise. The pathogenic wind-heat initially harms the skin and hair; wheezing and shoulder breathing occur when wind-heat is strong and internally harms the lung energy and ancestral energy, hence the pulse is full and strong. The calmness of the pulse is due to the stomach energy of the Yangming channel. A rapid pulse indicates that the stomach&#39;s energy has been depleted, resulting in death.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Children&#39;s Direct Prescription</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Qian Yi)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Fever According to the Classics</strong></p>
<p>For tidal fever, the heat comes at a specific time and subsides after the period; it returns at the same time the next day, which indicates a tendency toward convulsions. For persistent fever, the heat does not cease; in severe cases, it can lead to convulsions. In cases of wind-heat, there is body heat accompanied by hot breath, indicating an external wind pathogen. In cases of warm-heat, there is slight heat in the limbs.</p>
<p>If there is fever without thirst, it indicates weakness of stomach qi and internal heat, treated with Bai Zhu San. If there is fever along with thirst, and a preference for cold drinks and food, it indicates excess heat in stomach qi, treated with Xie Huang San. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to the &quot;Secret Collection for Protecting Infants,&quot; persistent tidal or strong fever in children is often due to changes in the body&#39;s inner balance and dynamics among the five viscera, and may not require medication. Excessive food intake can cause internal heat manifesting on the surface, thus treating the internal condition to clear the bright yang heat will help resolve surface heat without mistaking it as an external pathogen; using heavy purging medications like Xiao Chai Hu might harm the internal state instead. If tidal fever is prolonged, it might indicate the onset of smallpox, so careful examination is necessary before using medications. It is suggested that for those with thirst, heat is internal, while those without thirst have external heat. This should be noted for differentiation. Various heat conditions are described in different categories.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>If, after a serious illness, both the body and eyes turn yellow, it is called jaundice. Symptoms include body pain and stiffness in the back, difficult urination and defecation, and a generally yellow appearance with dark yellow urine; this is jaundice. If it results in diarrhea, it is difficult to treat. If, after a hundred days or half a year, the body remains yellow without an underlying illness, it indicates stomach heat causing fetal jaundice; if the yellow is pale combined with white, it indicates a weak stomach. </p>
<p>(Note: After a serious illness, if the body and eyes are all yellow, or if the limbs are swollen and yellow, it signifies spleen deficiency and true organ disease; it is advisable to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction or the Ginseng and Poria Powder to replenish vital energy. If there is thirst after illness, it indicates spleen deficiency and insufficient fluid, so one should use the Seven Flavor Poria Powder. If the spleen channel is damp and hot, causing constipation, and the pores are unable to release, this leads to the condition called jaundice, treated with Yin Chen Decoction. If at birth the body is yellow and hot with constipation, this is due to fetal heat and requires the Rehmannia Decoction. If there is dark and difficult urination with abdominal distension and a red face, accompanied by thirst, use Yin Chen Decoction and adjust with Five-Flavor Powder. If the stool is clear and self-regulating, and the limbs are cold, use the Benefit Yellow Powder; for pale yellow and white, use the Regulate the Center Pill.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong>  【Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi】</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Experience for Pediatric Summer Heat and Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>In children, if the body is steaming with heat, the chest is full and uncomfortable, the skin appears yellow like a rotting orange, and the whites of the eyes are also yellow, when the muscles and bones are weak and unable to stand or walk, this is due to the intense summer heat compounded by dampness, which causes the heat to thin in the meridians, penetrating to the bones and marrow, resulting in imbalance in the vital organs. Hence, the spleen reverses to affect the heart, and the combination of damp heat leads to this illness. Indeed, when the heart fire is excessive, the body steams with heat, the chest is full and uncomfortable, and when spleen dampness dominates, the skin appears yellow like a rotting orange. Any excess energy must overcome what it can overpower, leading to the kidney and liver being invaded, resulting in weak muscles and bones that cannot stand or walk. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that &quot;when there is heat in the spleen, the color is yellow and the flesh wriggles,&quot; and it also states that damp heat causes atrophy—this is truly wise! This is called the child able to make the mother full; when the mother is full, it will drain the child. If the spleen soil retreats to its original position and the kidney water is restored, then the heart fire will also calm down. Furthermore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that the treatment for atrophy is primarily drawn from the yangming channel, and this is indeed the case. I used a modified version of the Yellow Draining Powder as the main treatment.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Young Children’s Comprehensive Handbook by Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fever</strong></p>
<p>In general, when children are ill, they always have a fever. Since the symptoms differ, the treatment must also vary. It is essential to understand whether the condition is due to deficiency or excess, and one must not rashly induce sweating or purging. </p>
<p>For fever caused by a cold, the symptoms include sweating, body heat, yawning, a flushed face, puffy eyes, shortness of breath, and aversion to wind. This is due to the body releasing wind. It is advisable to disperse the wind, relax the muscles, and reduce the fever. First, take Chai Ge Jie Ji Decoction to expel the wind pathogen, and when the fever subsides, take Liang Jing Wan to prevent internal heat.</p>
<p>For fever caused by cold damage, the symptoms are fever without sweating, body heat, restlessness, a flushed face, breathlessness, aversion to cold, and a sensation of heat in the mouth. This occurs due to the body releasing cold. It is appropriate to disperse the cold pathogen, reduce the fever, and calm the spirit. First, take Xing Xing San to expel the cold pathogen, and then take Liang Jing Wan to prevent internal heat.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Two diagnoses: for a child with a strong constitution, use the Cool Shock Pill; for one who is weak and timid, use the Wei Ling Pill, which is very effective. If there is a cold with fever, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, do not disperse, as this indicates a deficiency of the spleen. In this case, the most effective treatments are to take Wu Ling San and swallow it with Li Zhong Tang.</p>
<p>Generally, colds with fever are most common in summer, presenting with symptoms like body heat, spontaneous sweating, thirst, and drowsiness, with both hands and feet feeling hot. This is due to excessively hot weather and being too heavily bundled up, leading to overheating. First, administer Bai Hu Tang to clear the heat and adjust with Yi Yuan San to relieve the heat, then take Tiao Yuan Sheng Mai San to replenish the original qi.</p>
<p>Heat from summer illness often occurs in summer as well, with symptoms of body heat, spontaneous sweating, thirst, and drowsiness, but with slightly cold hands and feet. This is due to excessive cooling in a shaded environment. First, administer Tiao Yuan Sheng Mai San to replenish the righteous qi, then follow with Si Jun Zi Tang to prevent the risk of vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>If sweating in summer occurs in the wind, resulting in persistent heat and sweating, this condition is called summer wind.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>First, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with the addition of ephedra root and astragalus to dispel the wind; then, apply the Yi Yuan Powder to clear the heat. For food injury causing fever, the symptoms include heat in the palms, a particularly hot abdomen and back, belching that leads to vomiting milk, acidic and foul-smelling stools, possible abdominal pain with excessive crying, or a feeling of fullness and difficulty breathing, with no desire for milk or food. This results from excessive eating. It is advisable to first remove the accumulation with clove digestive pills; then adjust with the Ji Sheng Pills. If the food injury has persisted for a long time, leading to gradual yellowing and emaciation, with heat occurring at all times, avoid purging. For lighter cases, use Baohe Pills, and for heavier cases, use Ji Sheng Pills, which are infallible. </p>
<p>For seasonal rashes with fever, the symptoms include dryness of the face and redness of the cheeks, redness of the eyes, excessive yawning and irritability, alternating hot and cold sensations, coughing, sneezing, cold hands and feet, anxiety, and excessive sleepiness. This is due to contagion from seasonal rashes. Cooling and detoxifying treatments are recommended.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>For smallpox, the appropriate remedy is Shensu Decoction with added Mu Xiang; for measles, use Jingfang Baidu Powder. Do not recklessly induce sweating, as it may lead to complications. </p>
<p>In the case of transformation into fever, this is a typical illness in children, where medication is not necessary. Instead, observe the conditions closely to avoid errors. </p>
<p>Fever with tidal-like symptoms can be categorized into two types. One type has fever occurring at specific times, then subsiding afterward, recurring at the same time the next day, resembling malaria; this is termed lung heat. The other type has fever appearing morning and evening, occurring twice daily like the ebb and flow of tides; this indicates stomach heat. This is generally caused by exposure to pathogenic qi, resulting in stagnation of blood vessels. If untreated, it may lead to severe complications like convulsions in children.</p>
<p>For lung heat, the main remedy is Digupi Powder; for stomach heat, take Sanhuang Pill. For those who are weak, Ji Sheng Pills can be used to regulate. </p>
<p>In cases of alarming fever, the patient exhibits full-body heat, pale face with sweating, restless heart palpitations, rapid and agitated pulse, and signs of confusion; this condition is due to heart heat. Treat it with Liangjing Pills for excessive heat, and tranquilize with Anshen Pills to calm the heart.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Night heat refers to fever that occurs at night, subsiding during the day; this is a symptom of blood deficiency and can be treated with Ginseng and Angelica Powder, along with Baolong Pill to prevent convulsions. </p>
<p>Residual heat occurs when fever recurs after sweating and purging in illnesses like typhus; this indicates that both the exterior and interior are deficient, with qi not returning to its source and yang rising to the surface, making it inadvisable to use cooling medicines again. It is said that when heat dissipates, cold may emerge, and the ancients warned against this. The stomach qi should be harmonized to allow yang qi to consolidate, which will naturally reduce the heat. The Ginseng, Poria, and Atractylodes Powder can address this; in severe cases, the Four Noble Ginseng Decoction with added dried ginger is very effective. </p>
<p>Parasitic heat presents with yellowed, thin appearance, insufficient growth in body mass, bone steaming, night sweats, inconsistent diarrhea, a large abdomen, and weak muscles. This condition often arises after major illness due to insufficient rest, or from effects of hunger and a lack of nourishment. The Jijiang Pill is notably effective for this condition.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>For those suffering from strong heat, it is a persistent heat resulting from the obstruction of blood and qi, which generates internal heat in the five organs, leading to restless sleep and a distracted mind. When this heat evaporates outwardly, both the body and surface experience heat, causing agitation and coarse breathing, and in severe cases, it can lead to convulsions. The treatment method begins with taking Dao Chi San to purge heat and Qing Wan to address the heat, followed by Bao Long Wan to calm the disturbances; if due to real heat there is obstruction in urination and defecation, San Huang Wan should be administered.</p>
<p>For those experiencing vexing heat, with an agitated heart and restless five organs, warm limbs, and red, painful urination, it is advised to use Dao Chi San, Mai Men Dong, and Shan Zhi Ren for treatment, followed by Liang Jing Wan to eliminate remaining evils.</p>
<p>For accumulated heat, characterized by red cheeks and mouth sores, along with painful urination, both superficial and internal conditions are solidified. This may be caused by the consumption of alcoholic beverages, strong heating medicines, thick bedding, or excessive heat exposure, which all can generate heat. This heat is a result of internal and external accumulation, not simply food stagnation. First, administer San Huang Wan, followed by Liang Jing Wan for balance.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Those with虚热 (false heat) may experience it due to excessive sweating leading to the depletion of bodily fluids, or as a result of a serious illness that has harmed their vital energy; both can cause fever. The symptoms include fatigue, weakness, a pale or bluish complexion, spontaneous sweating, a slow and soft spirit, and coldness in the hands and feet. This indicates a deficiency in both blood and qi; qi deficiency leads to coldness, while blood deficiency leads to heat. For treatment, one can use Si Jun Zi Decoction with roasted dried ginger added, and in severe cases, a slice of prepared Aconite can be included; wait until the fever diminishes slightly before adjusting with Ji Sheng Wan.</p>
<p>Regarding客热 (guest heat), the evil affects the heart. If the heart is affected, heat manifests on the forehead, starting with the head and face, followed by body heat, with a state of confusion and excessive fright; one may feel fearful upon hearing sounds. This is due to the deficiency of true qi and the victory of evil qi. Once evil qi prevails, true qi struggles against it, resulting in unquenchable thirst and unstable movements, like the incomings and outgoings of guests. First, administer Dao Chi San to expel the evil, then adjust with Liang Jing Wan.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Those with a heat tendency suffer from undigested dairy and food that accumulate internally, resulting in the formation of lumps that generate heat externally. The treatment method is primarily through the use of the Sacred Pill.</p>
<p>In the case of intermittent fever (malaria), there are alternating chills and heat. Symptoms may include headache, sweating, vomiting, loss of appetite, aversion to cold yet feeling hot and thirsty, body aches, abdominal pain, and vomiting or diarrhea. There are numerous manifestations, and treatment is not singular. For headaches with sweating and body aches, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qiang Huo and Cang Zhu is used; for abdominal pain, the Pi Ji Wan is appropriate; for thirst, the Bai Zhu San is beneficial; and for vomiting or diarrhea, the Li Zhong Decoction is recommended. All should also use Ping Xie Yang Pi Wan for adjustment.</p>
<p>For blood heat, fever begins daily around noon and cools throughout the night, indicating heart heat. For mild cases, Daohong San is used; for severe cases, Si Shun Yin is appropriate.</p>
<p>Traditional treatments for heat do not inquire into symptoms. For those with liver and kidney deficiency, Wei Ling Wan and bamboo leaf fried rice soup should be taken; for those with ample original qi, Liang Jing Wan and bamboo leaf light-heart mint soup should be used.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Xijiang Yue</strong>  </p>
<p>When a child falls ill, heat arises; one must understand the root cause of the illness. External wind and cold can provoke heat, while improper diet leads to internal distress. Vomiting, diarrhea, malaria, dysentery, skin issues, and acne may turn into severe boils. With bone heat and body weakness, one gradually becomes exhausted; understanding treatment is crucial.  </p>
<p>If it’s wind and cold affecting them, the face turns red, accompanied by aversion to wind and cold. The efficacy of awakening the child is difficult to articulate, but cough can be treated with herbs like Shen Su. For internal injuries from diet, a decoction containing San Huang can be employed for spleen accumulation. Additionally, the Ji Sheng formula should be added for safety, ensuring the spleen is not weakened and does not turn over.  </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea, the Wei Ling is the best remedy; use herbs like Xiang Lian for red or white dysentery. For malaria, treat with formulas that dispel evils; for skin problems, use Hu Ma Wan powder. When dealing with common childhood diseases like boils, do not hastily use decoctions or pills. If encountering smallpox or measles, consult a different specialist; use the Ji Sheng formula to address lingering illness.  </p>
<p>Treat heat with sweating and avoid mistakes; wrong sweats or purges can be harmful. One should purge when sweating is obstructed, and induce sweating when there are concerns about a sudden purge. Due to a lack of understanding between the exterior and interior, life might be in jeopardy. It is indeed difficult to discern, so one should utilize Wei Ling and Ji Sheng for treatment.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Fang Xian from the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Management of Pediatric Fevers</strong></p>
<p>When children experience fevers caused by fright, it is often mistakenly attributed to normal conditions, leading to disharmony of the heart&#39;s energy and a slight rise in body temperature. This results in restless sleep and dreamy fright, accompanied by sweating all over. In severe cases, the limbs may twitch and devolve into convulsions. This is due to a lack of harmony between qi and blood, with interior heat present, causing the spirit to be unsettled and resulting in convulsions. Children who experience rapid heat changes also tend to show signs of fright, which is similarly caused by excessive internal heat. </p>
<p>For treatment, remedies such as Seven Treasures Powder, Tianzhu Yellow Powder, Sweet Dew Powder, and Mercury with Gold Leaf Powder can be used. When fright leads to heat, it unsettles the heart, causing disturbed sleep and physical tremors; the heart is startled, leading to actual fever. If the child is in a weak state, they may lie still but be restless. This describes their condition.</p>
<p>Children with fever from &quot;warmth&quot; are often due to disharmony in the stomach qi, causing stagnant qi and accumulation of body heat, referred to as &quot;warmth accumulation.&quot; If the stool is foul-smelling and yellow, it indicates latent heat in the abdomen, to be treated with the Four Harmonizing Decoction. If the stool is pale and sour-smelling, it signifies undigested food; in such cases, Zisha Pills should be taken. For mild cases, a small dose suffices; for severe cases, reduce breastfeeding and increase the herbal dosage, aiming for mild relief.</p>
<p>Children experiencing strong heat are due to heat generated within the five organs and manifesting outwardly, causing generalized warmth in the body. This condition is similar to warmth accumulation but with slight differences.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>If the warmth is mild and not very intense, it indicates a moderate strength; but if the heat is excessively strong, it can lead to sudden shock. Treatments include Seven Treasures Powder and Dahuang (rhizoma) with Glauber&#39;s salt decoction. </p>
<p>For infants with wind-heat, if the body is warm, face is pale, mouth is hot, and they are irritable and restless, with wind symptoms present, one should use Huojing Pills and Tianzhu Yellow Powder. If the heat is severe and accompanied by constipation, Si Shun Decoction can also be taken. </p>
<p>Irritable and hot infants often suffer from internal heat in the organs, with abundant blood and qi leading to heat on both exterior and interior, causing restlessness and hot skin. Eight Treasures Decoction and Seven Treasures Powder can be administered. </p>
<p>For infants with hot hands and feet, who are irritable and crying with deep red lips, and drink water incessantly, treat them with Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction plus sweet dew powder. </p>
<p>For infants with tidal fever, if they have fever in the afternoon that subsides after a while, only to return at the same time the next day, this points towards a potential shock condition. Generally, it indicates obstruction of blood and qi, with internal organ heat manifesting outwardly, hence the moderate intensity of warmth which may be accompanied by hidden heat or lingering cold. Hidden heat manifests with yellow, foul-smelling stools, and lingering cold presents with white, sour-smelling stools. Both conditions arise from excessive heat in the organs and an accumulation in the intestines and stomach. Treat these with Jinlian Decoction, Kexiao Decoction, and sweet dew powder; if symptoms persist beyond the expected duration, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Qian said: If the tidal heat is due to a solid organ being weak and a hollow organ being weak, then the method should be to tonify the mother and drain the original organ, and it will recover. For instance, when tidal heat arises at noon, it indicates heart deficiency. The liver is the mother of the heart, so first, the liver should be strengthened, and then if the liver is solid, the heart can be drained. The heart, receiving the mother’s energy, will stabilize internally, resolving the tidal heat. </p>
<p>When a physician sees tidal heat and mistakenly thinks it is substantial, he uses cold laxatives like rhubarb and sodium sulfate to purge. Although this may seem effective in the short run, it often depletes bodily fluids, leading to a lack of nourishment and resulting in emaciation and the onset of chronic conditions. </p>
<p>For children with accumulated heat, if both the exterior and interior are hot, the entire body will feel hot, with flushed cheeks, dry mouth, reddish urine, and yellow, scorched stools. One should first give herbal decoctions like Si Shun Yin or San Jie Niu Huang San to assist in moving the organs and dispelling heat. Once the heat is relieved, if abdominal heat remains, it means that the internal heat has subsided but the exterior heat has not. At this point, one should use Jing Jing San or Hong Mian San with a little ephedra to induce mild sweating to dissipate the exterior heat. </p>
<p>If exterior heat is alleviated but fever persists, why is that? Conventional physicians struggle to understand this. Some continue using cooling medicines, others try to release the exterior again, or mistakenly think it cannot be treated, resulting in many cases of premature death.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>This table indicates a state of deficiency; the vital energy does not return to its source, and the yang floats externally. Hence there is a resurgence of heat, which is not a true heat condition. One should use Yigong San combined with glutinous rice decoction to harmonize the stomach&#39;s energy, thereby drawing the yang energy inward and cooling the body. For severe heat, use Chén Shā (cinnabar) and Jīn Bó (gold leaf) powder or Qián&#39;s Bái Zhú powder.</p>
<p>For children with deficient heat, after an illness has subsided, their blood and Qi may not yet be balanced, leading to weakness and frequent episodes of heat. The treatment should focus on regulating Qi and tonifying deficiency to allow the heat to naturally subside, using formulas like Qián&#39;s Bái Zhú San, Yigong San, or Si Jūn Zǐ Tāng; if not subsiding, using Ginseng and Shēng Xī (fresh rhinoceros horn) is advisable.</p>
<p>For children with excess heat, symptoms include dizziness, flushed cheeks, oral heat, red and scanty urination resembling bean juice, hard or constipated stools, or abdominal urgency, indicating excess heat. Treatment should involve Sì Shùn Yǐn Zǐ, Dà Huáng (rhubarb) and Xǐo (sodium) decoction, Bā Zhēn San, and gentle movements of the viscera for relief.</p>
<p>Children with &quot;Kǎn heat&quot; show signs of fever and emaciation, excessive thirst, and insufficient food intake that fails to nourish the body. This condition manifests after three or four years of age. Treatment should involve Jīn Guā Wán, Yù Chán Wán, or Féi Ér Wán for the best results.</p>
<p>For purely yang children, who do not show signs of deficiency or emaciation, the use of warm tonics is limited. Previous scholars discussed fourteen indicators of febrile illnesses in children, providing many effective formulas. Contemporary practitioners should follow the insights of the ancients, observing physical signs, assessing color, taking pulses, and diagnosing accurately to differentiate between exterior and interior deficiencies and excesses. Misdiagnosis not only risks the lives of the young but also deceives one&#39;s conscience!<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>　　　　Pediatric Application 【Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan】</p>
<p>　　　　　Excess Heat</p>
<p>If there is liver heat, the eyes appear green, and there is a tendency to scratch the collar and twist objects. Use Xie Qing Wan or Dang Gui Long Hui Wan for treatment. If there is heart heat, the eyes appear red, and one should observe the warmth of breath from the mouth during sleep. Preferring to sleep face down or on the back, with teeth grinding, use Dao Chi San or Huang Lian An Shen Wan for treatment. If there is heat in the eyes and a deficiency of the heart, use Qian’s An Shen Wan for treatment. If there is spleen heat, the eyes appear yellow; use Xie Huang San or Yin Chen Wu Ling San for treatment. If there is lung heat, the eyes appear cloudy white; use Gan Ju Tang or Mu Tong San for treatment. If there is kidney heat, the eyes lack brightness and are sensitive to light, the spine feels heavy, and there is an excess of whites in the eyes. Use Di Huang Wan for treatment.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>In cases of false heat, this often occurs after a major illness, or it may present as warm heat, tidal heat, with or without thirst. Bowel and urinary functions remain normal; it is appropriate to nourish it with remedies such as Bamboo Leaf Decoction, Regulation of the Origin Decoction, or Earth Bone Bark Powder. </p>
<p>In cases of true heat, the face appears red and dry, the nose feels parched and scorched, there is a preference for cold, perhaps lying with the face down or on the back, exposing the hands and feet, tossing off clothing and bedding, experiencing intense thirst and drinking a lot of water, with constipation in bowel and urinary functions; it is necessary to purge it using methods like Xiu Xiong Pill or Big Golden Flower Pill. For cases of constipation, the Gallbladder Guidance method should be used.</p>
<p>When asked: &quot;Treating heat with cold and treating cold with heat, a skilled craftsman cannot neglect their tools.&quot; Is there a rationale for using warm medicine in treating false heat? I said: &quot;The rationale is detailed in the Inner Canon.&quot; True heat is caused by pathogenic fire, which can be mitigated by water or reduced by solid means; therefore, using cold to treat heat is a counteractive approach. False heat, on the other hand, represents genuine fire. Water cannot suppress it, nor can cold reduce it; only sweet and warm remedies can overcome it. Thus, treating false heat with warmth is a supportive approach. Whether counteractive or supportive, both must adhere to the correct method.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p>
<h3>Children&#39;s Questions on Heat Symptoms</h3>
<p>In children&#39;s illnesses, heat is most prominent. There are two types of heat: true heat and false heat. True heat presents with a flushed face, a yellowish complexion, rough breathing, a hot mouth, dry thirst, swollen lips, difficulty with urination and defecation, and restlessness with loud crying. False heat shows a pale, bluish face, lethargy, coolness in the mouth, weak breath, frequent urination and diarrhea, and night sweats. Sometimes, symptoms may alternate between hot and cold, with agitation and anxiety, strong upper body heat, and weak lower body symptoms; this indicates an imbalance of heat and cold.</p>
<p>For false heat, administer &quot;Bai Du San&quot; with added Mu Xiang and Dang Gui. If both internal and external heat are present, with a yellow complexion and red cheeks, dry lips, a dry mouth, red and scanty urine, and dark yellow stool, first use &quot;Si Shun Qing Liang Yin&quot; to clear and relieve this heat. If the exterior symptoms are not resolved, one should use &quot;Xing Xing San&quot; with a little Ma Huang to induce sweating; if the exterior heat has dissipated using &quot;Chai Hu San,&quot; then harmonizing the body will balance the heat. For symptoms like shock heat, wind heat, and accumulated heat, &quot;Kuan Re San&quot; may be taken to expel heat, and &quot;Bao Shou San&quot; or &quot;Jin Fen San&quot; can be used to reduce residual heat.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Heat Wave</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: The heat wave occurs periodically, appearing at specific times and subsiding afterward, returning again at the expected time. This is a desire to express surprise. The onset of the heat wave resembles the fever of malaria, hence it is generally called a heat wave. It manifests in cycles, and its heat has three sources: the warmth of the body’s nutrients (Rong), the warmth of the protective qi (Wei), and the heat from pestilential miasma. It may return every two days or every three days, and is treated with pear syrup drinks. Wang&#39;s teachings suggest that the heat wave is due to stagnant blood and qi within the internal organs, generating heat that surfaces outward, thereby causing fever. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states that the heat wave is real heat, which should be alleviated by promoting bowel movements, using prescriptions such as Da Chai Hu Decoction or Cheng Qi Decoction. For virtual heat, treatment should be based on Di Gu Pi Powder, Xie Jiao Drink, Bieh Jia Powder, Ling Xi Drink, Qin Jiao Drink, and Sheng Xi Powder. The &quot;Seng Ji Jing&quot; recommends the Di Gu Pi Drink and Qiang Huo Cake among others.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive Heat and Mild Heat</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang stated: Excessive heat is continuous and unrelenting, potentially leading to seizures. Mild heat, on the other hand, is only warm and not overly hot. Chao’s commentary indicates that in children, excessive heat is due to intense qi, radiating outward, hence causing a robust sensation throughout the body. The onset is sudden, resembling mild heat with minimal differences, except that it becomes more severe. In such cases, it is advisable to take mild medications such as Xingxing Powder or Qiang Huo Powder; in severe cases, one can use formulas containing Huang Qin, Chai Hu, and Gan Ge to dispel the heat. Mild heat occurs due to imbalances in children&#39;s internal organs, with hidden heat or lingering cold, all affecting the stomach qi, leading to disharmony. The stagnation of qi causes accumulated heat in the body, termed mild heat.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If the stool is yellow and foul, it indicates lurking heat within. If the stool is white and has a sour smell, it suggests lingering cold, which should be warmed; it is advisable to take the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added cinnamon for treatment. For lurking heat, both Wuling San and Baihu Tang are effective. If there is lurking heat causing fullness in the abdomen, Chai Ling San should be used. If the heart and spirit are unsettled, with heat accumulating in the large intestine, Erhuang Xijiao San is indicated. If there is persistent heat that does not subside, Niuhuang San should be employed. If residual heat after resolving constipation remains, Ge Gu Pi San or Huanglong Tang may be taken; Niuhuang Gao also treats strong heat, while Zhizhi Lingyang Jiao Tang addresses various sudden strong heat responses. For persistent heat after bowel movements, accompanied by strong body heat and pain in the joints, combinations of Zhi Zi Ren Tang, Da Lian Qiao Yin, Liu Wu Huangqin Tang, and Wu Wu Ren Shen Yin should be selected based on symptoms. The ancient method for dispelling lurking heat uses Long Dan Tang, and for eliminating retained stagnation, Zi Shuang Wan is very effective. The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; recommends the use of Sheng Ma, Shao Yao, and other herbs for treatment.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p>
<h3>Restlessness</h3>
<p>It is said: &quot;Restlessness is caused by heat in the heart; agitation arises from wind in the heart.&quot; When there is heat in the heart, the spirit becomes confused, leading to inner discomfort and anxiety. When the heart is disturbed, it fills up, and naturally, fear arises. Agitation, on the other hand, is due to wind evils affecting the heart, also causing confusion in the mind and resulting in restlessness. More heat leads to unrest; prolonged anxiety brings fear; more wind leads to instability; prolonged agitation results in spasms. </p>
<p>The treatment method involves cooling the heart, reducing excess heat, and facilitating urination, which is optimal. For severe heat, the Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction is recommended; for lighter cases, the Dao Chi San or Yu Lu San can be used. If wind-heat is present, Zhi Bao Dan, Hu Po San, or Jie Du Wan can be taken; for those with cold damage symptoms, a combination of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and Bai Hu Decoction, omitting Da Huang but adding Gan Gan can be effective. For those experiencing fever and fright, Jin Bo Zhen Xin Wan and Qi Wu Huang Lian Decoction are particularly beneficial.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Thirst Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>It is discussed that for children suffering from thirst, if their lips appear red like vermilion for three to five parts, they are slightly thirsty; if the redness is severe, their thirst is intense. Lips that are both red and charred black indicate prolonged thirst with excessive heat, leading to a rapid and extreme deterioration in their condition. Generally, when a child has a deficiency in the Sanjiao (three energizers) causing restlessness and thirst, with persistent drinking, it is appropriate to use Sanhuang Pills. If a child experiences thirst after contracting a cold with charred lips and significant dryness and agitation, Baihu Decoction is the main prescription; Zhulei Decoction can also be administered. For children who suffer from diarrhea leading to thirst, Wuling Powder with the removal of cinnamon, and the addition of kudzu is particularly effective. Xiangru Decoction and Cheqianzi Powder can both be used; Xiaochaihu Decoction with the addition of tianhuafen is also good, and adding kudzu is even more stable. For those who experience intense heat, restlessness, and thirst, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction is suitable, as well as Qiwuhuanglian Decoction, which is very stable. In general, children are inherently robust and prone to generate heat, resulting in thirst and the urge to drink.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang says: If there is body pain, a strong backache, difficulty with urination and bowel movements, and the entire body turns yellow, with the face and nails also yellow, the urine resembling the color of dust from a house, and everything turns yellow upon contact, it is difficult to treat if there is thirst. This is jaundice. Most cases are prevalent after serious illness. There is another case, where a person is slightly yellow after birth within a hundred days or the first six months, not due to illness, which indicates stomach heat, and this applies to adults as well. Furthermore, if there is a yellow face and a swollen abdomen, coupled with vomiting and thirst, it indicates spleen disease. Another case is when a newborn has jaundice, which is fetal jaundice. All jaundice conditions indicate heat, and those with a deep yellow color are the most severe. If the color is light yellow mixed with white, it indicates a weak and unbalanced stomach. The treatment includes Yin Chen Decoction, Gardenia and Cortex Ponciri Decoction, Rhino Horn Powder, and Forsythia and Red Bean Decoction. For general treatment of jaundice, Yin Chen and Wu Ling Powder is especially steady. Additionally, if there is weakness of the spleen with yellowing and clear urination, treatment should involve warming agents, primarily using Angelica Pills or Decoction; Xiao Ban Xia Decoction can also be used. </p>
<p>— Ming Medical Miscellanea, [Ming Dynasty, Wang Lun]<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>潮热</strong>  </p>
<p>Childhood tidal fever, or persistent high fever, often arises from internal transformations and the conflict among the five organs, and does not necessarily require medication. It is also commonly due to dietary stagnation, with internal heat expressing outward, manifesting on the skin. One should address the internal issue and clear the heat of the clear yang to remove the surface heat; it should not be mistaken for an external pathogen, as rashly inducing sweating with small doses of Chai Hu and similar herbs can harm the internal constitution. Persistent tidal fever may signal the emergence of rash, and one should carefully examine the situation and refrain from hastily using medicine! </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the condition arises from dietary stagnation, or is accompanied by abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea, or abdominal distention, it is advisable to use Baohuan Pills to eliminate stagnation and strengthen the spleen. If the diet is cleared, but there is abdominal pain with no appetite or abdominal distention, it is appropriate to use the Four Gentlemen decoction to nourish the stomach qi. If excessive sweating or purgation has harmed the original qi, it is recommended to use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, dried tangerine peel, and licorice to replenish the central qi. Generally, food injury must damage the spleen and stomach, and one should stabilize the stomach qi to prevent further complications. </p>
<p>Tidal heat occurring between the hours of Yin (1-3 AM) and Mao (5-7 AM) belongs to the liver channel; heat during the periods of Si (9-11 AM), Wu (11 AM-1 PM), and Wei (1-3 PM) pertains to the heart channel; heat from Shen (3-5 PM), You (5-7 PM), and Xu (7-9 PM) relates to the lung channel; heat during the hours of Hai (9-11 PM), Zi (11 PM-1 AM), and Chou (1-3 AM) is linked to the kidney channel. One must carefully assess the deficiency and excess to treat accordingly. For conditions classified as deficient heat or excess heat, if treatments are initiated without results in worsening or improvement, it likely indicates a deeply rooted issue not reached by the medication, thus requiring prolonged treatment. Once the efficacy arrives, all ailments will recede, and it is crucial not to switch to other treatments. Should the medicine not align with the symptoms, the consequences can be dire, so one must be cautious!<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu stated: Yang jaundice presents with red and sparse urination, body heat, indicating a struggle between the spleen&#39;s earth and the heart&#39;s fire, classified as a Yang disease. The treatment should first promote urination and then induce defecation. For treating jaundice with abdominal distention, use Yin Chen Hao Decoction combined with Wu Ling San. If the goal is to promote urination, omit Da Huang; if to promote defecation, add Da Huang or similar substances. If there are Yang symptoms, such as a flushed face when drinking water, it can be treated with this method. Yin jaundice, however, is characterized by spontaneous bowel movements, yellowing of the face and body, and cold limbs, indicating spleen deficiency unable to control kidney water; use Yi Huang San and Shi Jun Zi Wan. For pale yellow with white, indicating disharmony in the stomach, administer Ping Wei San or Tiao Zhong Wan. If there is thirst, use Ren Shen Bai Zhu San.</p>
<p><strong>Cold-Induced Diseases in Children by Tao Hua (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fever in Children</strong></p>
<p>For children with intense fever and drowsiness, suffering from both wind-heat and rashes or food injuries, these symptoms can be similar, making differentiation difficult. Intermittently administer Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang, Xing Xing San, or Xiao Chai Hu Tang, as they are effective in general treatment without causing misdiagnosis. However, for food injuries, there may be sour and foul-smelling stool, poor digestion, aversion to food, or vomiting, in which case medication should be taken to address these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment by Wang Kentang (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Differentiating Fever Symptoms</strong><a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The warm wind resembles heat. The warm wind leads to a condition where the body is not hot but the breath in the mouth feels hot. There is also a warm wind syndrome, which is warm but not hot. </p>
<p>In the case of cold damage with fever, there are symptoms of a hot mouth, yawning, and feelings of discomfort with a tight neck. In cold damage with fever, the tips of the fingers are cold, the nose runs clear mucus, there is fever without sweating, the face appears pale and shaken, and the right cheek has purple lines. </p>
<p>In the case of smallpox fever, there is sneezing and restlessness, with cold ears. In measles fever, the face is red while the feet are cold, the body has strong heat, yawning brings discomfort, there is coughing and back pain, sometimes there&#39;s a startle, abdominal pain with diarrhea, and the middle finger may be cold. </p>
<p>In transformed steaming heat, white blisters like beads appear on the lips, and the ears are cold. Transformed steaming heat is characterized by mild warmth and slightly rough breathing, with fewer surprises, yellow watery stools, and small blisters like droplets on the upper lip, which does not require aggressive treatment with medicine. </p>
<p>In the case of consumption heat, the face is yellow, the skin is thin like charcoal, and the area under the nose is sore and red. In shock wind heat, there are symptoms of convulsions, anxiety, rapid pulse, and confusion. </p>
<p>In shock wind heat, the entire body feels hot, the face shines with sweat, there is palpitations and restlessness, the pulse is rapid and agitated, and the treatment method is the same as in the case of acute shock symptoms, thus one must first resolve the exterior with medicine. </p>
<p>Pediatric illnesses are predominantly related to heat. Heat may be of various types: tidal heat, shock heat, night heat, residual heat, food heat, consumption heat, vigorous heat, irritative heat, accumulated heat, wind heat, empty heat, guest heat, obstructive heat, cold heat, blood heat, and rash heat, totaling sixteen types that are largely similar but with minor differences. The onset of heat must have a cause.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The heat from the tidal fluctuations comes and goes at times, with alarming heat causing delirium. Nighttime heat arises in the evening and subsides by dawn, but residual heat and cold pathogens persist. When hot food is consumed, it first affects the stomach and abdomen, leading to heat and bone steaming, causing night sweats. Continuous strong heat does not subside, resulting in agitation and anxiety. Accumulated heat causes flushed cheeks and mouth sores; wind heat leads to sweating and body heat. Deficient heat results in fatigue and weakness, while guest heat fluctuates. Phlegm heat causes coughing and thirst, with chills alternating like malaria. Blood heat may lead to fever and eventually to ear and nose coldness with sores and rashes. Each symptom manifests distinctly, though some may overlap; treatment should be adjusted according to severity.</p>
<p>In children, heat varies among the five organs: liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney. There are differences in Qi, whether it is abundant or weak, and distinctions in the exterior, interior, blood, Qi, Yin, and Yang, as well as the presence of wind, dampness, phlegm, and food issues that should be examined in detail. </p>
<p>For heart heat, the forehead first turns red, accompanied by restlessness and heart pain, with palms feeling hot, leading to drinking more water, especially aggravated during the hours of Si (9-11 AM) and Wu (11 AM-1 PM). For liver heat, the left cheek first turns red, resulting in constipation, muscle cramps, increased anger and fright, fatigue in the limbs, worsening between Yin (3-5 AM) and Yang (5-7 AM). For spleen heat, redness appears on the nose first, causing lethargy, a desire for sleep, increased body heat, and worsened symptoms at night. For lung heat, the right cheek first turns red, causing facial twitching, wheezing, and alternating chills and fever, markedly worse in the late afternoon. For kidney heat, the area below the chin turns red first, with significant heat in the feet, and a sensation of worms gnawing at the bones, becoming unable to rise from bed, worsening at night.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>One must still discern between true and false conditions: If true, the face will be flushed and breathing labored; the mouth will be dry, lips swollen, craving cold drinks, with difficult urination and defecation. There may be exposure of the body, restlessness and loud cries, stretching out to lie down, unable to keep the eyes closed while sleeping, with hot hands and feet; in this case, the exterior should be treated. If false, the complexion will be pale and ashen, with a dazed mind and weak spirit; the mouth cold, breath weak; a preference for warmth and aversion to cold, with frequent diarrhea and urination, sometimes feeling alternating hot and cold, tension and vigilance, with a raging upper body and draining lower body. At night, there will be profuse sweating, lying curled up, eyes exposed during sleep, and cold hands and feet; in this case, nourishment and tonics should be used. In cases of strong heat, the limbs will be very hot, and if the heat persists, it may provoke convulsions. In cases of mild heat, the limbs will be slightly warm, and if the heat continues, it may provoke spasms. Yin deficiency leads to internal heat, while excess Yang leads to external heat.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>When lightly touched, it feels hot, but pressing down firmly does not elicit heat; this is the heat of the skin and superficial blood vessels, existing on the surface. When pressed firmly at the tendons and bones, it feels hot, but lightly touching does not evoke heat; this is the heat of the tendons and bones, existing internally. When pressed with moderate pressure and heat is felt, this is the heat of the muscles, located between the superficial and the internal layers. </p>
<p>In terms of distinguishing between excess and deficiency, we say: strong heat that dislikes wind and cold indicates insufficient vital energy, a superficial deficiency of heat; strong heat that does not dislike wind and cold indicates the presence of an external pathogen, a superficial excess of heat; strong heat accompanied by drinking broth indicates a deficiency of fluids, an internal deficiency of heat; strong heat with water drinking indicates internal fire being consumed, an internal excess of heat. </p>
<p>If there is heat both internally and externally, then one experiences wheezing and thirst, dry teeth and irritation, a distended abdomen and hot limbs, feeling like being scorched by fire when exposed to wind and cold, unable to tolerate winter but not summer; this all reflects an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. When both pulse positions are full, this is a condition of strong excess; when both pulse positions are weak, this is a condition of strong deficiency.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The pulse is either large and forceful, or it is weak and slippery; it may be rapid and strong, which indicates an excess of heat resisting the yin. Although the symptoms may appear cold, they are not truly cold. If the pulse is rapid yet weak upon pressure, this indicates an excess of cold overcoming the yang. Although the symptoms may seem热, in reality, they are not hot. </p>
<p>Symptoms include fever, aversion to heat, persistent thirst, agitation, hot skin, and a dislike of clothing. The pulse is large and weak under pressure; if accompanied by eye pain and dry nose, this indicates blood deficiency leading to restlessness, and one should nourish the blood. </p>
<p>If there is an inability to eat and spontaneous sweating occurs, this indicates qi deficiency and one should replenish the qi. Zhang Zhongjing discusses the insufficiency of both internal and external factors, noting that for symptoms of fever with spontaneous sweating, one should avoid inducing sweating. </p>
<p>If there is fever due to dietary indiscretion or labor, mistakenly inducing sweating can lead to a deficiency in the exterior.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Those who have a fever and sweat experience wind; those with fever, body pain, and a heavy yellow body experience dampness; those with increased chills, fever, sensitivity to wind, spontaneous sweating, floating pulse, and chest oppression experience phlegm; those with fever, headaches, and rapid pulse experience food issues. A rapid pulse at the inch signifies insufficient yang, with yin energy rising into the yang; thus it leads to aversion to cold. A weak pulse at the cubit indicates insufficient yin, with yang energy descending into yin, resulting in fever; when yin and yang do not return to their proper balance, there is a struggle between cold and heat. If one is quiet during the day but experiences fever and restlessness at night, it indicates that yang energy has sunk into yin; if one experiences fever and restlessness during the day but is quiet at night, it indicates an abundance of yang without yin, and yang must be urgently purged while yin is strongly replenished. If there is body heat, a tense pulse, trembling, and no aversion to cold, it indicates damp malaria; if there is fever, aversion to cold, and a floating rapid pulse, it indicates a warm disease. If the limbs are hot, and the mouth, tongue, and throat are dry, it indicates fire heat overwhelming the earth element, resulting in combined heat and dampness, hence the restlessness and confusion; if the body feels heavy, with swelling and pain, this results from heat and dampness clashing, as wind heat becomes blocked and cannot be released.</p>
<p><strong>Heat in the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Liver heat: When one seeks their collar or fidgets, administer Qingwan.<br>Strong heat: If one drinks water and feels short of breath, administer Baisan.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Those with liver heat will experience redness in the left cheek, difficulty in muscle contractions, irritability, and fatigue in the limbs, worsening during the hours of the tiger and rabbit. It is advisable to take Qing Wan and Chai Hu Yin Zi. </p>
<p>For heart heat, observe the warmth of the breath from the mouth during sleep; if one sleeps with the face covered or grinds their teeth, this indicates heart heat, treated with Dao Chi San. </p>
<p>When heart qi is heated, the chest also becomes hot, causing one to struggle to speak, feeling a desire for coldness, hence the tendency to sleep with the face covered. Symptoms include redness on the forehead, restlessness, heart pain, heat in the palms, and excessive thirst, worsening during the hours of the snake and horse. It is advisable to take Xin Tang, Dao Chi San, and An Shen Wan. </p>
<p>With spleen heat, there will be yellowing of the eyes, a distended abdomen, lethargy, a desire to sleep, body heat, and limbs that cannot be drawn back. This condition is treated with Huang San. </p>
<p>In cases of spleen heat, the nose will show initial redness, and the heat affects the muscles, worsening at night. </p>
<p>For lung heat, use Gan Ju Tang for symptoms manifested in the hands, eyebrows, eyes, and face; for cough with alternating chills and fever, excessive thirst, use Liang Ge San. If there is lung deficiency heat, the lips will be deep red, and a small amount of Xie Bai San should be taken. </p>
<p>With lung heat, the right cheek will initially be red, with increased heat in the afternoon; for mild symptoms, use Xie Bai San, for severe symptoms, use Liang Ge San and Di Gu Pi San. </p>
<p>In cases of kidney heat, the feet dislike being covered, treated with Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>For kidney heat, there will be redness under the cheeks, significant heat in the feet, a sensation of bones being corroded, and an inability to rise from bed, especially worsening at night. The appropriate remedy is Zi Shen Wan.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>True Heat</p>
<p>When there is true heat, the body stretches out while lying down and one cannot sleep with their eyes open; there are symptoms such as hot hands and feet. According to true heat, it is appropriate to distinguish between exterior and interior: for exterior heat, sweating is advisable; for interior heat, purging is necessary; for a combination of both, harmonization and resolution are recommended. Currently, the focus is primarily on purging, which is not a universal rule. The treatment methods and prescriptions should be sought within the guidelines for exterior and interior. For children with true heat internally, they should take cooling drinks; if the heat is above, inducing vomiting is necessary. For children&#39;s febrile diseases, Liu Yi San is an excellent remedy.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>For true heat, it is advisable to take a clear, cool drink with Bupleurum.</p>
<p>For false heat</p>
<p>When there is false heat, one tends to like warmth and dislike cold, experiencing alternating sensations of cool and warm, feelings of suffocation and anxiety, symptoms of excess above and deficiency below, curling up to sleep with eyes exposed, and coldness in hands and feet, among other signs. False heat occurs after an illness, presenting with persistent fever several times a day. This is due to pathogenic heat occupying a vacuity. First, take a warming herbal decoction with Astragalus powder, mixed with warm, clear rice soup; then administer Qian&#39;s White Atractylodes Powder, or Guhong Decoction, to be taken cool; also, use warm salty water mixed with cool water, and take along with Heixidan to consolidate original qi. For wind-heat and evil heat, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with fresh ginger and Schizonepeta decocted. For children with internal heat, start with Daohong Powder and then use Yihuang Powder. Xue&#39;s distinction between true and false, as well as heat obstructing Yin, cold obstructing Yang, and symptoms of blood deficiency and qi deficiency causing fever, aligns with the diagnostic practices of esteemed physicians like Zhongjing and Dongyuan. It is recommended to study and familiarize oneself with these methods carefully so as to avoid misidentifying false heat as true heat, thus preserving the well-being of the many. For false heat, it is suitable to use Xingseng Powder.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Exterior and Interior</strong></p>
<p>If the body is hot but does not drink water, the heat is external.<br>If the body is hot and drinks water, the heat is internal.<br>For a heat disorder treated with Four Shun decoction, it addresses internal heat and does not cause adverse reactions.<br>For heat treated with Lianqiao decoction, it addresses external heat and does not cause adverse reactions.<br>Xue argues: intense heat with aversion to wind and cold indicates that the essential energy is insufficient, suggesting virtual heat at the surface; intense heat without aversion to wind and cold indicates external pathogens, suggesting actual heat at the surface. Intense heat treated with soup indicates a deficiency of bodily fluids, suggesting virtual heat inside; intense heat treated with water indicates internal fire blazing, suggesting actual heat inside.<br>When discussing wind-cold and aversion to cold, can one differentiate between aversion to wind and cold as a sign of insufficient essential energy, versus not having aversion due to external pathogens? Xue’s point is circular and his language unclear; can one speak dreams before fools? One must distinguish carefully between external influence and internal injury according to Dongyuan, to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Exterior Heat</strong></p>
<p>For heat with well-regulated urine and stools, where wind pathogens are trapped internally and emerge, use the Xingsheng powder with Mahuang decoction. </p>
<p><strong>Residual Heat</strong><a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The residual heat refers to the lingering heat transmitted through the channels by the unfinished cold pathogens. Ren Zhai states: after a cold injury, when sweating and purging have occurred but heat reappears, both the exterior and interior are deficient, qi does not return to its source, and yang is floating outside, making it inappropriate to use cooling medicines again. The ancient sages warned that when heat departs, cold arises. The proper approach is to harmonize the stomach qi, allowing the yang qi to gather inward, which will naturally stop the heat. The formula Shen Ling Bai Zhu San should be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>In cases of children with heat syndrome, after using both exterior and interior medications, if the heat completely subsides and then reappears, what is the reason? Heat diseases at this stage are difficult to generalize. Some may require re-expelling the exterior and attacking the interior, or applying cooling agents, which can intensify the heat. To differentiate between yin and yang, which is the correct approach? Upon investigation, it is found that both the exterior and interior are deficient, with yang floating outside and yin hidden within, leading to renewed heat. It is suitable to use warming and balancing medicines to harmonize the interior, allowing bodily heat to naturally resolve. The Qian family’s Bai Zhu San should be prepared without mu xiang, boiled in water, alongside Huang Qi Liu Yi Decoction and An Shen San, to allow for natural recovery.</p>
<p>If sweating excessively leads to blood deficiency and worsens heat, add glutinous rice to Liu Shen San; if sweating causes qi deficiency with aversion to cold and fever, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for sweating with yin deficiency and no support for yang, use Si Wu Decoction with Ren Shen and Huang Qi; if sweating results in yang deficiency and no support for yin, use Si Jun Zi Decoction with Chuan Xiong and Gui.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Zhuang Re (Strong Heat)</strong></p>
<p>Strong heat is persistent, with blood and qi congested and the five viscera generating heat. When this heat steams internally, it causes restless sleep and mental confusion; when it manifests externally, it results in heat both inside and outside, causing irritability and labored breathing, and in severe cases, it may lead to seizures. For mild cases, administer Fire Mansion Pill or Earth Yellow Decoction; for severe cases, use Double Relief Drink, Seven Treasures Powder, or Large Yellow (Shi Bu) Nitrate Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Wen Zhuang (Warm Strength)</strong></p>
<p>Warm strength resembles strong heat but differs slightly: it is heat that persists but is not overwhelming, referred to as warm strength. If the stool is foul and yellow, this indicates hidden heat in the abdomen, which can be treated with the Four Harmonizing Drink. If the stool is white and has a sour smell, it indicates undigested food; one should take Purple Frost Pill, using it sparingly for mild cases; for severe cases, reduce breastfeeding and increase the pill dosage, seeking a slight profit in treatment.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Surprising Heat</strong></p>
<p>Surprising heat manifests as a sensation of heat throughout the body, sometimes mild, with a pale face and sweaty skin. Individuals may experience nightmares, sudden awakenings, and confusion. It can arise from shock causing heat, or from heat causing shock. Remedies like Qian&#39;s Dao Chi Powder and Liang Jing Pills help calm the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Steaming Heat</strong></p>
<p>For children aged one to ten, they should not wear new cotton clothing, nor should they heat clothing or bedding over a fire in winter. They should avoid cold foods like peaches, apricots, and feijoa, as well as roasted or heated foods, all of which can cause internal heat. Sometimes, early consumption of meat after a cold can cause this heat. For bone steaming heat, one should take Shengxi Powder, Kexiao Decoction, Digubupi Decoction, Qibao Powder, or Jinlian Decoction. Bone steaming heat is characterized by a weak and thin body, often worsening in the evening, with heat present but no chill, and thirst that subsides only after sweating. This is a lingering toxin from dysentery that manifests as bone steaming, sometimes accompanied by internal masses or mild pain. Treatment includes Shenling Baizhu Powder, ginger and jujube decoction, or Huafei Pills to address spleen deficiency and retained food, followed by Chaihu Decoction for further treatment. It is also advised to avoid chicken, alcohol, mutton, and toxic substances. </p>
<p><strong>Tidal Heat</strong><a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Heat has its onset and cessation; it appears daily at the appropriate times, known as tidal heat, like the tide that does not fail to arrive on schedule. Tidal heat can be differentiated into categories: wind-heat, damp-heat, food stagnation, each influenced by yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and the various organs. For example, if sweating and body heat are present with yawning and a flushed face, it indicates wind-heat; in cases of epidemic diseases or exogenous heat, yin and yang conflict leads to external heat; symptoms like emaciation, dry mouth, and bone steaming with night sweats signify damp-heat; constipation or diarrhea with unresolved sweating indicates accumulated heat; abdominal and back heat that arises at night and ceases by dawn relates to drinking of heat; if there is phlegm and cough, inability to digest milk, it pertains to food stagnation heat.</p>
<p>Additionally, those with vexatious heat manifest coarse breathing, a rapid pulse, restlessness, red cheeks, mouth sores, and may also experience seizures; skin rash heat results in cold tips of the ears and nose; blood heat presents at midday, cooling down by night; deficient heat leads to fatigue and weakness, emerging after illness. Yang pathogens disturb the heart leading to irregularities, and the conflict of yin and yang results in alternating cold and heat similar to malaria.</p>
<p>In children, such symptoms may arise from the mother’s excessive emotions or rich diets during pregnancy, or from dietary stagnation, overly warm bedding, and frequent hot baths. If heat occurs during the hours of Yin (3-5 AM) or Mao (5-7 AM) with vigorous drinking, it indicates excess heat in the liver channel; use Chai Hu Qing Gan San. If heat is present but with weakness while drinking soup, it indicates deficiency heat in the liver channel; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If heat appears during the hours of Si (9-11 AM) or Wu (11 AM-1 PM), it relates to the heart channel; use Dao Chi San for excess, and Mi Zhi An Shen Wan for deficiency. If heat arises during the hours of Shen (3-5 PM), Xu (5-7 PM), or Hai (9-11 PM), it implicates the lung channel; use Xie Bai San for excess, and Mi Zhi Bao Pi Tang for deficiency. If heat appears during the hours of Zi (11 PM-1 AM), Chou (1-3 AM), it relates to the kidney channel; use Di Huang Wan.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Generally, if one has a strong fever accompanied by thirst and constipation, it indicates excess heat. To treat this, administer the Erhuang Xijiao San to clear it. If there is heat and thirst but normal stools, this suggests blood deficiency, and the Siwu Decoction should be used for supplementation. If there is deficiency after treatment, with yang failing to support and heat persisting, add Renshen and Huangqi to the Siwu Decoction. If sweating leads to yang deficiency, where yin fails to generate heat yet there is still warmth, use the Sijunzi Decoction with Xuangui. In cases of thirst, flushed face, and irritability post-sweating, this indicates blood deficiency causing agitation; the Danggui Bu Xue Tang is appropriate. If there are signs of shock or convulsions, indicating liver blood deficiency and internal wind, utilize the Siwu Decoction along with Tianma and Diaoteng. For a flushed face, dry mouth, red urine, and scorched yellow stools, indicating heat both inside and outside, employ the Qingliang Yinzi. If stools have improved or heat persists while the external pathogen is unresolved, the Xing Xing San should be applied; if needed, add a slight amount of Mahuang for mild sweating. If there is continued heat post-sweating, this shows deficiency inside and outside, with qi not returning to its source, and yang floating outside leading to false heat; apply the Liu Shen San with polished rice. If the yang energy descends into the yin and causes fever, the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang should be administered. If treating a nursing infant, also treat the mother.</p>
<p>The Zeng family first used Baijie San for the exterior, then applied Danggui San and Sanjie San for further treatment. For a firm pulse, use Da Chaihu Tang; for a weak, floating pulse, a slight sweat with Baijie San is appropriate. If there is fever and vomiting, use Xiao Chaihu Tang for harmonization.</p>
<p>For children with tidal fever and night sweats, a fine powder of Hu Huanglian and Chaihu formed into pills with honey and Qian Shizi, taking two pills dissolved in a little water and decocting briefly. </p>
<p>For intermittent tidal fever and chest fullness with shortness of breath, use the Taozhi Wan.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Daytime Heat</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Complete Pediatric Formulas&quot;: When children experience a fever after eating in the morning and are cool at night, many doctors attribute this to deficiency-induced labor or malnutrition heat, not realizing that this is a case of blood heat. It is advisable to administer Long Dan Pills or Rehmannia paste, which, when taken regularly, will lead to recovery. According to &quot;Complete Pediatric Formulas,&quot; blood heat refers to fever occurring at the hour of the Snake (9 AM to 11 AM) and Horse (11 AM to 1 PM), which then cools at night, differing from Dongyuan&#39;s description of fever at night and clarity during the day. The explanation from Shuyuan points to blood heat as arising from Yin deficiency creating internal heat; thus, fever at night and clarity during the day reflects the cycle of Yin at night and Yang during the day. Zheng&#39;s interpretation of blood heat refers to children having abundant and full blood. The reason for referencing the hours of the Snake and Horse is due to the heart&#39;s fire being active at this time. The heart governs blood, and when the blood and Qi circulate to the hours of the Snake and Horse, Yang energy is strong, clashing with the righteous Qi, which causes the fever at that designated time. If it occurs outside this period, it is not considered blood heat.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Night Heat</strong></p>
<p>Hai Cangyun: Night heat belongs to Yin; among the four seasons, it is related to drinking, which indicates that this blood heat occurs at night. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states that if there is residual food in the small intestine, there will be a tendency to heat in the evening, which will stop by the following day; this is the night heat from residual food. Wind phlegm heat causes evening heat and morning coolness with irregular water intake; this situation suggests that phlegm brings about wind heat, and it is appropriate to administer the Jinxing Pill. If the Qi is weak, do not purge; instead, use the Duoming Powder to control the salivation, followed by the Xingsheng Powder with added Nansheng and Baifuzhi.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulated Heat</strong></p>
<p>Accumulated heat refers to persistent heat. Consumption heat also lasts long but is accompanied by a sallow complexion, similar to eating charcoal or earth, with ulcers under the nose. For children with both exterior and interior heat, if fever reappears after the exterior has been addressed, this is not a heat syndrome. Use the Liu Shen Powder into polished rice decoction to harmonize their stomach Qi, which returns the Yang inward, making the body cool. For those with severe heat, use the Yinbai Powder. Accumulated heat can lead to puffy eyelids, a sallow face, and cold feet, with fever emanating from the head to the abdomen, possibly accompanied by food odors, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Treatment methods are detailed in the discussion on injury from accumulation. According to Zeng, the so-called accumulated heat refers to heat from intestinal masses and differs from long-standing accumulation, and they may coexist.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Cold and heat refer to symptoms resembling those of malaria, arising from the struggle between yin and yang. When cold comes first and heat follows, it indicates insufficient yang; when heat comes first and cold follows, it indicates insufficient yin. When there is more cold and less heat, yin overcomes yang; when there is more heat and less cold, yang overcomes yin. When cold and heat are balanced, yin and yang are in mutual conflict. If cold and heat alternate daily, yin and yang are briefly separated; when yang is strong, it causes heat, and when yin is strong, it causes cold. Symptoms may include headache with sweating, vomiting with loss of appetite, increased cold with drinking water, intense heat with consumption of soup, or muscle and joint pain. There may be diarrhea or constipation, or internal cold with external heat, or internal heat with external cold. Furthermore, there are cases where one feels cold with abdominal pain and heat with rumbling in the abdomen, indicating food accumulation. For treating food accumulation, one should use white flour for expelling it; then proceed with reinforcement using Qian&#39;s white atractylodes powder. For conditions of more cold and less heat, Xiao chaihu decoction with cinnamon should be used; for more heat and less cold, Baihu decoction with cinnamon; for balanced cold and heat, Xiao chaihu decoction should be the principal remedy. The classics state: When yang is deficient, external cold arises; when yin is deficient, internal heat arises; when yang is strong, external heat arises; when yin is strong, internal cold arises. The alternation of cold and heat indicates the struggle between yin and yang. Therefore, cold associated with yin causes cold symptoms, while warmth associated with yang causes heat symptoms.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>The inch pulse is weak, indicating insufficient Yang, and when Yin energy rises into Yang, it leads to aversion to cold; the ruler pulse is weak, indicating insufficient Yin, and when Yang energy descends into Yin, it causes fever. Insufficient Yang leads to cold first and then heat, while insufficient Yin leads to heat first and then cold. When Yin and Yang do not return to their proper divisions, cold and heat struggle against each other. Additionally, if the upper part is excess, it manifests as fever; if the lower part is excess, it manifests as cold. When Yang is dominant, there is sudden heat; when Yin is dominant, there is sudden cold. If Yin and Yang overcome each other and the deficiencies and excesses are unbalanced, then evil Qi arises, causing alternating cold and heat, resulting in sudden cold and sudden heat.</p>
<p>The Shao Yang gallbladder is a part of the liver’s organs, situated between the Tai Yang and Yang Ming, half superficial and half internal, making it easier for Yin and Yang energies to interact. Consequently, cold and heat often dominate liver and gallbladder syndromes, which can be adjusted with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, modified as needed. If only cold and heat are evident, and daily life remains unchanged, prolonged illness without recovery, along with post-serious illness where the Yuan Qi has not restored, indicates Yin deficiency generating heat and Yang deficiency generating cold; thus, it is advisable to use Ba Zhen Decoction for nourishment, and in severe cases, Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. </p>
<p>If there&#39;s food stagnation causing illness, it can also result in cold and heat, which can be resolved with Bao He Wan; if there are accompanying symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction. For critical cold with hot beverages, Ren Shen Li Zhong Wan is effective. If thirst persists, use Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. After food stagnation is resolved but cold and heat still persist, it suggests that liver evil is overpowering the spleen, indicating a deficiency where it is not overcome; in this case, use Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu and Shan Zhi Zi. For malaria symptoms of alternating cold and heat, refer to the section on malaria.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Restlessness</strong></p>
<p>Zhongjing said: When fire enters the lungs, it causes restlessness; when it enters the kidneys, it causes agitation. The heart is the monarch fire; when the fire is vigorous, the metal (lungs) is incinerated, and when the water is depleted, the fire alone persists, thus the lungs and kidneys come together to result in agitation. The &quot;Living Person&quot; states: When one feels hot and restless, it is due to deficiency and agitation. Various instances of deficiency, agitation, and heat resemble those of cold damage, but there is no aversion to cold, and there is no nasal pain; hence, it is known not to be cold damage. There is no headache, and the pulse is not tight, thus it is known not to be internal cold. Sweating and purging are inappropriate; rather, it should be treated with Bamboo Leaf Decoction; if there is also vomiting, use Tangerine Peel Decoction. Furthermore, if the heart is deficient, there will be restlessness followed by thirst, with heat rising and the pulse being floating, tight, and large. Here, agitation arises from inner disturbance and internal heat, hence it is attributed to yang; restlessness involves the limbs being agitated, or a desire to enter a well naked, being outward heat, hence it is attributed to yin. External heat is a fire without root, thus it represents deficiency. When the pulse is rapid and solid, with constipation and heat, use Shenxiong Pill; these are all treatments for solid heat. If there is restlessness with headache, shortness of breath, dry mouth, and throat without thirst, this indicates deficiency; use Four Ginseng Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Angelica. If thirst arises from the medicinal attack, use Bamboo Shoots Decoction. For restlessness and inability to sleep, use Sour Jujube Seed Decoction. For disturbance of the spirit, with restlessness and desire to vomit, use Cinnabar Peaceful Spirit Pill. If the face is flushed, eyes are red within, with all six pulses being large and floating, pressing them yields nothing, indicating blood deficiency leading to restlessness, use Angelica Blood Nourishing Decoction. If agitated and desiring to enter a well naked, with a pulse that is deep and fine or floating and large, pressing gives no response, this indicates excessive yin leading to agitation; it is thus advisable to use Ginseng and A附 Decoction, which has restorative effects.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Notes on Late Summer</strong></p>
<p>The spleen is associated with the Taiyin, situated in the Earth element, favoring dryness and disliking dampness. Therefore, when the spleen and stomach qi is insufficient, encountering the humid and sultry conditions of late summer hinders the rising of clear yang and the healthy movement of the central qi. Additionally, during the time of the slight yang fire, heat can injure the original qi, leading to lethargy in the limbs, weakness in the feet, excessive sleeping accompanied by fever, a lack of spirit, little appetite, tastelessness in the mouth, shortness of breath, blurriness in vision, frequent and red urination, and irregular bowel movements. This condition is called &quot;Late Summer Affliction.&quot; These symptoms all reflect a deficiency of yin and original qi. Danxi discusses the treatment in detail regarding the nurturing of children; should one not also know the method of nurturing yang in winter? The treatment method involves the use of the &quot;Ba Zhen Tang&quot; (Eight Treasures Decoction) by removing the herbs Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, and adding the roasted black Huang Bo as the main ingredient.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>If one develops a fever due to labor and has deficient blood with a large pulse, use the Angelica Sinensis Blood-Toning Decoction; if both qi and blood are deficient, use the Eight Treasures Decoction; if there is deficiency of liver and kidney yin, use the Rehmannia Pill; if there is diarrhea, use the Ginseng Decoction for Regulating the Middle. If a nursing mother has liver fire disturbing the spleen and experiences chills, heat, and poor appetite, use the Chai Hu and Gardenia Powder; if there is thirst due to stomach fire, use the Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. Children often suffer due to the imbalanced qi of their nursing mothers, so they must avoid anger, regulate diet, and adjust to cold and warmth to prevent illness. Nowadays, people commonly use fragrant rush decoction as a cold infusion to replace tea in summer. However, they are unaware that fragrant rush promotes diuresis and greatly diminishes original yang; magnolia bark can inhibit and cause significant depletion of true qi. Moreover, the spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold; in summer, when yang is abundant internally, drinking cold can harm the spleen. Those with strong stomachs and fire, or those suffering from damp-heat ailments, may not experience significant harm, but those with weak spleens and stomachs, or insufficient central qi, are likely to suffer from abdominal pain, reduced appetite, and diarrhea caused by cold. Adults should also take caution in these matters, let alone children! Be cautious!<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>The text &quot;Nan Zhi&quot; states: If the color appears as a deep yellow, it is a damp disease, and the entire body aches. If the color resembles that of an orange, it is a jaundice disease, and the body does not ache. </p>
<p>For dry jaundice, characterized by dryness, with spontaneous urination, limbs not feeling heavy, and thirst leading to drinking, one should use the Lu Hu Zhi Pi Decoction. For damp jaundice, related to the spleen, with difficulty in urination, heavy limbs, and a sensation of thirst without desire to drink, the Da Yin Chen Decoction is appropriate. If there is spontaneous yellow bowel movement, one should consider the decoction of Yin Chen, Zhi Zi, and Huang Lian. </p>
<p>For alternating chills and fevers, accompanied by a yellow complexion all over, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Zhi Zi is recommended. According to Tang Shi: If there is body pain, pain in the waist and back, difficulty in urination and feces, and the skin, face, teeth, and nails are all yellow, with urine resembling the color of house dust, those with easy urination are easier to treat, whereas those with difficulty are harder to treat. It is advisable to take Wu Ling San with Yin Chen decoction or Dao Chi San with Yin Chen decoction. If there is heat in the body, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be taken, and in severe cases, Cheng Qi Decoction may be administered.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>In general, cases of jaundice cannot be treated uniformly. The root and branch differ, and so do the symptoms and treatments. This condition may arise from a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, leading to the absorption of damp heat, which obstructs the pores and manifests on the skin, accumulating and resulting in yellowing. Alternatively, it may stem from weakness of the spleen and stomach, with internal causes attacking and giving rise to symptoms such as yellow skin, protruding belly with blue veins, muscle wasting, lack of external color, and a必黃色a complexion, which relates to wasting disease. </p>
<p>Treatment: If the jaundice is caused by damp heat, it resembles smoke-induced color; one should use Wuling Powder with Mahuang, boiled with fresh ginger and taken as a decoction, which will induce sweating and lead to recovery. Alternatively, Yinchenshao Decoction combined with Wuling Powder is also effective. </p>
<p>If it is due to wasting disease, the appearance resembles yellow earth; in this case use the Lingwai San or Huapi Pill to awaken the spleen and resolve accumulations caused by wasting.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>When the stomach&#39;s qi is harmonious and food intake increases, the essence is transformed and refined, nourishing the body and irrigating the organs. The five colors manifest in their respective parts, and the essence and vitality are expressed in one’s appearance, with any yellowish hue fading away. The classics say: &quot;The central yellow corresponds to the spleen.&quot; Therefore, jaundice is the color of the spleen. The spirit of a person is more precious when it is contained and quietly utilized; when it is seen externally, it indicates internal deficiency. This is all due to a deficiency of spleen qi, where transformation and transportation fail, causing dampness and heat to linger in the skin, resulting in jaundice. As Qian Zhongyang stated, symptoms like body aches, back weakness, and yellowing of the skin, face, and nails indicate this condition, with brownish urine being difficult to treat. The treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen first; if one relies solely on harsh purgatives and diuretics, it is rarely safe. If jaundice occurs in newborns within the first hundred days or six months, without being due to illness, it is due to stomach heat or fetal jaundice.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>If there is a large abdomen with soil eating causing spleen dampness, and also accompanied by thirst for cold drinks, use the Huang San. For difficulty in urination, use Yincheng Decoction. If there is yellowing of the body and edema after illness, use Baizhu San. For those with self-regulating bowel movements, cold limbs, and a tendency to lie down, use Yihuang San. If the body is pale yellow and white, use Tiaozhong Wan and add Yincheng to Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If there is heat, fullness in the stomach, and the skin and face are all yellow, then modify and use the Huang San. </p>
<p>If the symptoms include closed eyes, intense heat, continual crying, and red and thin urine with heat in the mouth, this indicates the signs of pregnancy poison from rich food. Both mother and child should take Sheng Di Huang and avoid alcohol, shallots, and hot foods. If one is not careful and injures the spleen and soil, the condition can quickly turn into convulsions and diarrhea, or slowly lead to edema of the limbs, difficulty in urination, and closed eyelids, resulting in many cases of dampness diseases. There are also cases of yellowing due to spleen deficiency; one should seek solutions within the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Chao Re (Tidal Fever)</strong></p>
<p>When a child initially suffers from tidal fever or experiences it post-illness, it relates to the excess of food harming the Taiyin Spleen Meridian. It is advisable to use Shen Ling Bai Zhu San. If there are sores or boils accompanying the tidal fever, modify Ba Zhen Tang by adding Bei Mu.</p>
<p><strong>General Theories on Child Health</strong></p>
<p>When a child has body heat that is warm but not excessively strong, this is classified as a warm heat. If the child&#39;s body heat is accompanied by a hot sensation in the mouth, continuous crying, yawning, signs of restlessness, and a bluish complexion, this indicates wind heat, which may also lead to fright. If the child exhibits body heat with anxiety over drinking water, trembling hands and feet, looking upwards while moving the tongue, visible blue veins on the inner hands, red palms, and fear of objects causing salivation, this is deemed startling heat. If a child has body heat with a red face that does not subside over time, disturbed sleep with cries, rapid breathing and thirst, elevated chest with phlegm stagnation, this represents accumulated heat. It resembles strong heat but is distinct due to the phlegm accumulation in the elevated chest, indicating a build-up of heat and toxins in the organs, causing stagnation in the three burners. Also, if the child shakes their head and has a stiff neck, it too indicates stagnation in the three burners. All of the above may lead to convulsions in severe cases, and treatment should be approached through the gate of fright and convulsion.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>When a child has a fever, experiences shortness of breath, nasal congestion, clear runny nose, sneezing, chills, tearing, or possibly produces phlegm, this is classified as a cold injury, treated according to the protocols for a cold injury.</p>
<p>If a child has a fever that comes and goes, with a hot belly during the fever; or if they have a nighttime fever with a yellow face, abdominal bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, and food not digesting well, with a sour and foul-smelling stool, this indicates food injury, treated according to the protocols for food injury.</p>
<p>When a child has a nighttime fever that resolves by morning, excessive salivation, and seems to enjoy sleeping, this suggests that the child has a deficiency of the lungs causing the fever, which can resemble a food injury. It is crucial to differentiate between the two, as the residual symptoms vary: in food injury, one can use purgatives; in lung deficiency, one should not, as doing so will lose vital fluids, causing thirst and a desire for drinks. </p>
<p>In the past, Qian Yi treated a five-year-old who had a nighttime fever that resolved by morning. Many physicians characterized it as a heat condition and prescribed cooling medicines, but it did not improve.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The patient had excessive salivation and frequent spitting, and when medicine was administered to reduce the saliva, the illness worsened. After five or six days, I asked Yi to treat him. Yi said: &quot;Do not administer a laxative.&quot; He then prepared three sheng of decoction from Atractylodes powder, allowing the patient to take as much as he needed. Zhu asked: &quot;If he drinks too much, won’t it cause diarrhea?&quot; Yi replied: &quot;With no living water, it cannot cause diarrhea. Even if there is a discharge, it is not alarming; just don’t use a laxative!&quot; Zhu further inquired: &quot;What illness was treated first?&quot; Yi responded: &quot;To stop diarrhea, treat phlegm, reduce fever, and calm the spirit—all with this medicine.&quot; After the prescription was fully taken, it was given again twice, and the child was no longer thirsty and had no phlegm. Then, two doses of Ejiao powder were given, and he was at peace. This is indicative of that condition. This is recorded in the collected works of Qian Yi. </p>
<p>For children with fever, emaciation, and excessive thirst, whose diet does not lead to muscle growth, it indicates intestinal heat, which should be treated by addressing the intestinal issue. </p>
<p>For children with abundant blood and energy, excessive thirst leading to drinking, hard yellow stools, scant red urine, and heat in the limbs and body, it indicates heat in the stomach, which should be treated with a laxative.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>When a young child has a slight fever and is slightly startled, with cold ears and white blisters appearing on the upper lip like fish eyes, and either has sweat or does not, this indicates a condition called &quot;transformation steaming,&quot; which is treated under the category of &quot;transformation steaming.&quot;</p>
<p>When a child has a fever, is lethargic and startled, enjoys sneezing, and has cold ears, this indicates symptoms of measles, treated under the category of &quot;measles.&quot; This is similar to illness caused by food injury leading to transformation steaming, where cold ears are hot in cases of cold damage, while the dual steaming with white warts and blisters on the lips is different.</p>
<p>Fever in children may derive from both internal and external causes. Internal causes often arise from excessive water consumption, while external causes are typically due to wind and cold. According to Qian, when a child has an internal fever and drinks a lot of water, it indicates internal heat, while if a child has a fever and does not drink water, it indicates external heat. This is a general diagnostic principle. For internal causes, treatment should focus on purging, while for external causes, treatment should focus on dispersing.</p>
<p>Yan Xiaozhong discusses the patterns of high fever from wind chill and illnesses like warm epidemic and cold damage, as well as wind-heat measles and food injury, which are all quite similar and often difficult to distinguish. However, treatments like Shengma Gegen Decoction, Xingsingsan, and Xiao Chaihu Decoction have proven to be very effective.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>These several medicines can be used for treatment without causing harm. For those with dietary injuries causing foul-smelling stools, undigested milk, food aversion, or vomiting, it is advisable to use a mild purgative. </p>
<p>Master Sun discussed that children with excess internal and external energy might experience slight fright during sleep or mild symptoms of wind or dietary injury, as well as a concern for heat in the body. For such cases, using Ziyuan or Longdan Decoction is appropriate. These two medicines can treat a wide range of ailments. Although they may slightly purge to reduce excess energy, they do not deplete the body’s strength. </p>
<p>If a child&#39;s stools are yellow and foul, it indicates hidden heat in the abdomen, and Longdan Decoction should be administered. If the stools are white and sour-smelling, it indicates lingering cold and indigestion, and Ziyuan should be given. Administer in small doses to help with internal digestion, and if symptoms are severe, slightly increase the dosage to facilitate mild loose stools. It is essential to limit breastfeeding for a day or two to regulate stomach energy. If not restricted, the illness may easily recur, leading to repeated purging, which could harm the stomach&#39;s energy and cause abdominal bloating. If purging occurs multiple times, it would lead to excessive depletion.</p>
<p>After the beginning of summer, if a child has a feverish illness, be cautious not to recklessly induce vomiting or purging. Instead, use heat-clearing decoctions for bathing, apply heat-clearing powders, or use red friction ointments.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>When a child has all their skin and face turning yellow, this is called jaundice. It results from excessive rest or overindulgence in food, causing heat in the spleen and stomach, which conflicts with the air from grains, leading to evaporation outward. The spleen and stomach resemble earth, and their color is yellow, affecting the muscles and thus causing the illness. Care must be taken not to moxibust, as that would worsen the heat. If there is body pain, stiffness in the back, difficulty in urination and defecation, abdominal distension, the whole body is yellow, and the eyes and nails are also yellow, with urine like the color of dust, this is jaundice. If there is thirst, difficulty in urination, abdominal fullness, and a deep, fine pulse, it is difficult to treat. The yellow illness is slightly lighter, while jaundice is extremely severe. There is also jaundice that presents as deep yellow in the lower body; this is fetal jaundice due to the mother’s organ heat affecting the fetus. As the classics state, all jaundice that turns a deep yellow is similar. If the body is slightly yellow, it indicates stomach heat. If only the face is yellow and the abdomen is distended, accompanied by a desire to eat dirt, this indicates spleen deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Thirst</strong></p>
<p>When a child is thirsty and drinks water, it is because there is heat within the organs. Heat leads to dryness in the organs, causing the body to feel hot and thirsty, thus prompting a loss of fluids that creates a desire for water to relieve it. There are also symptoms of deficiency thirst, thirst due to vomiting and diarrhea, and thirst due to cholera; each has its specific causes and conditions. Yan Xiaozhong states: For all children&#39;s thirst, caused by the loss of fluids, make them drink by giving them a decoction of Qian&#39;s white atractylodes powder freely, and the more they drink, the better.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Pediatric Remedies</p>

<p>The classics state: &quot;The soil’s master is treated with bitterness.&quot; It also states: &quot;The spleen suffers from dampness; bitter foods must be consumed to dry it.&quot; Thus, Huanglian and Yincheng, with their bitter cold properties, are used to clear damp heat as the chief ingredients. The kidney needs to be firm; thus, bitter foods should be consumed to strengthen it, hence Huangbai’s bitter and cold character reinforces the muscles and bones as the minister ingredient. Damp heat creates agitation, thus it must be relieved with bitterness, which is why Huangqin and Shan Zhi, being bitter and cold, are used to calm restlessness and fullness as assistants.

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Qian&#39;s Direct Guidelines&quot; states: A five-year-old named Zhu suddenly developed a fever. The physician said: This is heat in the heart. His cheeks were red and his lips were red, and he was irritable and thirsty. Consequently, three doses of niuhuang pills were used, followed by a purging heart decoction. The next day, he did not improve, but instead appeared weak and could not eat; after further purging, he passed yellow foam. Qian remarked: The heart is deficient, and there is retained heat within, caused by the cold medicine, which has resulted in this condition of deficiency and wasting illness. It is better first to use baizhu powder, which promotes the body&#39;s fluid in the stomach. When asked how the yellow foam is produced, he responded: When the stomach&#39;s qi is right, it will naturally stop purging; this is deficiency heat. Zhu asked: What about the use of the purging heart decoction? Qian replied: The purging heart decoction contains only a bit of huanglian. Huanglian is cold in nature; prolonged use will cause purging and can chill the spleen and stomach. After sitting for a long time, many physicians arrived, all asserting heat is present. Qian insisted it was deficiency heat. If it were real heat, why would the purging heart decoction not settle it? In addition, with a yellow face and red cheeks, anxiety in the five hearts, and not eating but feeling thirsty. The physician inquired: Since it is deficiency heat, why is the stool yellow foam? Qian laughed and said: The yellow foam stool is due to taking the purging heart decoction. Qian treated him with Hu huanglian pills and cured him.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>A man from Zheng, the physician of Qi, was known for collecting and distributing medicinal herbs. His son suddenly developed a fever; the father self-prescribed three doses of Qingjin ointment and administered one dose as a pill. After taking them, at around midnight, the son experienced diarrhea five times and became drowsy. The father remarked that the son was excessively sleepy and gave him another dose of Qingjin ointment, resulting in three more episodes of diarrhea, accompanied by dryness in the mouth and feverishness of the body. The father noted there was still a slight remaining heat, so he administered more Qingjin ointment. The mother said, &quot;Using medicine more than ten times hasn&#39;t helped; what if he develops another illness?&quot; They called in Dr. Qian, who stated, &quot;He has become thin and weak.&quot; Initially, he used Baizhu powder, taken at intervals, then after thirteen days, he prescribed Xiangji pills, and the son recovered.</p>
<p>Zhu&#39;s five-year-old child developed a fever at night and returned to normal in the morning. Various doctors attempted to treat it as typhoid or as a heat illness, prescribing cooling medicines, but it did not improve. The child exhibited excessive salivation and was very sleepy. Other doctors tried giving iron powder pills to alleviate the salivation, which worsened the condition. After five days, they insisted on giving him a large drink. Dr. Qian said, &quot;It should not be purged.&quot; He then took one tael of Baizhu powder, boiled it down to three sheng of medicinal broth, allowing the child to take as much as he wished. Zhu asked, &quot;Won&#39;t drinking too much cause diarrhea?&quot; Dr. Qian replied, &quot;Water alone won&#39;t cause diarrhea, even if he drinks a lot, it&#39;s not surprising, but it should not be purged.&quot; Zhu asked, &quot;What was the initial illness?&quot; Dr. Qian explained, &quot;It stops diarrhea, treats phlegm, and clears heat to calm the spirit; all of this is due to this medicine.&quot; By evening, the medicine was fully consumed. Dr. Qian checked and said, &quot;He can still take three sheng.&quot; They boiled another three sheng of Baizhu powder, and upon consuming all of it, he began to improve slightly. On the third day, they again administered three sheng of Baizhu powder, and the child no longer felt thirsty or had excessive salivation. They also gave two doses of Wujiao powder, leading to his stability.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>Cao Xuande&#39;s child was three years old, had a yellowish face, intermittently suffered from chills and fevers, and did not eat or drink. Some used two pills of ox bile and musk, but there was no improvement; when the thirst-quenching dry kudzu powder was used, he vomited in return. The teacher said that food was lodged in the stomach, so first, a white biscuit was given to remedy it, then the digestion pills were ground and administered, and he was cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: In Caizhai, a household had a young boy of fifteen years old who had been ill with jaundice for a year, his face was yellow like gold, his body was swollen and weak, and he only consumed salt and burnt food. The Dai people used tea to adjust a powder which caused him to vomit a bowl of saliva. By evening, he was given seventy to eighty pills of Zhuoche combined with three qian of Tongjing powder, and four to five doses were taken. After six to seven days, he was administered Zhuoche pills and Jun Chuan powder, again taking four to five doses. He developed a dislike for salt and burnt food, and his complexion turned red. Later, more tea was used to adjust the powder and he expelled two liters of phlegm before fully recovering.</p>
<p>According to Wan’s &quot;Youke Huafen,&quot; a child developed a fever, particularly worsening in the evening. His doctor treated for malaria but it was ineffective, and then attempted treatment for tidal fever, which also failed. I said: this is a case of weak stomach with retained food. If it were malaria, there would be chills and fevers that start and stop; if it were tidal fever, the onset would occur at specific times like the tides, rising and then receding, only to return the next day at the same time. This child&#39;s body was usually warm, but became quite severe during the evening hours. Hence, it&#39;s understood this is a case of retained food causing a fever. He asked: is there a basis for this? I replied: refer to the theory of Zhang Zhongjing where it discusses the Yangming disease in the case of a febrile illness: tidal fever indicates an excess, which should be purged. Using the Sanhua pills results in recovery.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>A child suffered from a sudden fever that would not subside. Many doctors debated whether to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, some preferred Zhu Ye Decoction, while others suggested Liang Jing Wan. I said: After a shock, the spleen and stomach are already weak and should be warmed and nourished. The three medications are cold and should not be taken. Therefore, I created Li Zhong Decoction with roasted dried ginger, and one dose relieved the heat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot; states: Li Ge Lao&#39;s son suffered from tidal fever, maintaining his usual diet. It was particularly severe from the time of Shen to the time of Zi, then it would stop. His whole body seemed to have scabies, with constipation and red, painful urination, feeling thirsty and drinking cold. I believed the spleen and stomach had real heat, transmitted to the lungs and large intestines; I first used Qing Liang Drink in four doses, and the heat began to subside. Then I applied Si Wu Decoction with Chai Hu and Huang Lian for several doses, and his sores gradually healed. They desired quick effects, so they additionally used Huai Jiao Wan, and all symptoms worsened, leading them to seek out the hospital director. They also used Si Wu Decoction with Chai Hu and Huang Lian, adding Tao Ren and Chi Shao Yao, and after a hundred doses, he finally recovered.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>The &quot;Record of the Golden Mirror for Protecting Infants&quot; states: A small child, four years old, had a fever, drank cold water, developed sores in the mouth, and had a yellow-red complexion on the forehead and nose, with tongue protrusion and excessive salivation. I diagnosed this as heat in the heart and spleen, and treated it with two formulas, Dao Chi and Xie Huang, leading to recovery. However, it recurred, and I resorted to other treatments, administering cooling and phlegm-transforming medicines, but the previous symptoms worsened, along with tongue manipulation. I used Yi Gong San with additional Jiaoteng and achieved stability; I then used Liu Jun Zi Decoction for recovery. The protruding tongue indicates heat in the spleen channel; tongue manipulation suggests deficiency-heat in the spleen, causing the tongue to extend and retract. Practitioners should be discerning in their approach!</p>
<p>Another child had a fever, poor appetite, and unformed stools, often taking aloe preparations. Observing a red nose indicated that the cold remedies were harming the spleen’s earth element, resulting in deficient heat. I prescribed several doses of Wu Wei Yi Gong San to restore the vital energy.</p>
<p>A different child experienced difficulty urinating, had a dry nose with nosebleeds, and a red hue between the nostrils, indicating heat in the spleen and lungs. I used Ji Sheng Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction, and the previous symptoms improved. However, the skin between the chin remained red, with thirst and phlegm, suggesting insufficient kidney qi. I prescribed Di Huang Wan, and all symptoms resolved.</p>
<p>Another child had a fever and cough with a red hue on the right cheek; this indicated heat in the lung metal. I treated with Xie Bai San, which resulted in recovery. Subsequently, the child caught a cold and the previous symptoms returned, further complicated by heaviness of voice and nasal discharge. I treated this with Shen Su Decoction, adding apricot kernels and mulberry bark for recovery. However, the right cheek remained red, along with slight redness on the forehead, indicating that heart fire was affecting lung metal. I used Ren Shen Ping Fei San, and a single dose led to complete recovery.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>A five-year-old child was very thirsty, with slight redness in the right cheek and nose tip; whether drinking cold water or taking cool medicine, he would immediately vomit. I said: the slight redness in the right cheek indicates insufficiency heat in the lung meridian; the slight redness in the nose tip indicates insufficiency heat in the stomach meridian. This shows the stomach is weak and unable to nourish the lung. I first prescribed a dose of the Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with a bit of Bupleurum, and after taking it he did not vomit; then I used two doses of Atractylodes Powder, and he was no longer thirsty; finally, I gave him four more doses of the Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction, and he became stable.</p>
<p>Another child had tidal fever and great thirst, with hard and dry stools, shortness of breath, and coughing, along with redness in the right cheek. This indicated heat in both the lung and large intestine. I prescribed a dose of Chaihu Decoction, and all symptoms receded immediately. Later, due to slight fright, he had convulsions, gritted teeth, and was restless; this indicated deficiency of liver and spleen qi and blood, which I treated with the Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction plus Ligusticum, Angelica, and Uncaria, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child presented with tidal fever and restlessness, with a bluish-red left cheek; this indicated deficiency of heart and liver blood. I used the Secret Formula to Calm the Spirit Pill and the Four Substance Decoction with added Fangfeng and Suanzaoren to treat it, which soon led to recovery; I further prescribed Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill to nourish the liver and kidneys, and he healed.</p>
<p>In the book &quot;Essentials for Safeguarding Infants,&quot; it says: A child presented first with robust heat and constipation, who upon taking cooling drinks recovered, but then symptoms recurred; he took Dihuang Pi Powder but still had tidal fever; taking the Four Substance Decoction with Scutellaria at inappropriate times led to intensified heat. I remarked: If the heat is inappropriate, it may appear during the day and disappear at night, or vice versa, indicating empty heat, and one should nourish the source of transformation. If one does not believe and continues to take cold medicine, it will worsen. In the evening, I used Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, and in the morning I applied the Middle-Boosting Qi Tonic with added Dioscorea and Cornelian cherry, leading to a cure.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>A five-year-old child had a fever and thirst, with a slightly red right cheek and nasal tip. When given cold water or cool medicine, he immediately vomited. I said: the slight redness of the right cheek indicates deficiency heat in the lung meridian, and the slight redness of the nasal tip indicates deficiency heat in the stomach meridian; this shows that the deficiency of the stomach cannot nourish the lung. First, I prescribed the Four Gentlemen Decoction with a third of a dose of Sheng Ma, and he did not vomit. Then I used Bai Zhu San in two doses, and he did not feel thirsty. Finally, I prescribed the Four Gentlemen Decoction again in four doses, and he gradually felt better.</p>
<p>Another child had a fever and thirst. I prescribed Xie Huang San, which caused heavy and drooping stool, excessive salivation from the corners of the mouth, and still the desire to purge heat. I said: the nasal tip is pale blue, which indicates spleen deficiency being attacked by liver wood; the excessive salivation from the mouth indicates failure of stomach qi to govern salivation; heavy stool indicates that the spleen qi cannot ascend. Not believing this, additional cooling medicine was given, and indeed, the eyebrows and lips slightly moved, and all four limbs mildly convulsed. I remarked: this is severe deficiency of original qi leading to slow spleen wind. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang with roasted ginger, Angelica, Mu Xiang, and two doses of Diaoteng Gou, which greatly benefited him. He requested more doses. I said: this medicine does not have sufficient potency. If the medicine does not match the symptoms, disaster is imminent. Following the previously prescribed medicine, I added roasted ginger and a piece of Aconite. Upon taking it, he was immediately at ease; then I removed Aconite, and after two more doses, he recovered.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>A young child developed yellowing of the eyes within ten days, which gradually spread over the entire body. They were treated with a yellow-purging powder and recovered.</p>
<p>Another child, after the mother consumed something causing stagnation, experienced bloating and sourness in the throat, along with yellowing of the body. I treated the mother with a formula for stagnation and used the yellow-purging powder for the child, resulting in both being cured.</p>
<p>A child suffering from the previous symptoms took Five-ingredient Powder and Digestive Pills, but the yellowing did not improve. The child became thirsty for soup, had a bloated abdomen, and little appetite. I diagnosed a deficiency in stomach energy and fluids, causing a preference for soup; and a deficiency in spleen energy, leading to abdominal bloating and decreased appetite. Initially, I used White Atractylodes Powder, which resulted in gradual improvement, and then applied a tonic to replenish and invigorate energy, resulting in a full recovery.</p>
<p>One child had dietary issues, presenting with abdominal bloating, yellowing of the body, and golden-colored urine. After using various treatments for jaundice, they became thirsty for water. I diagnosed excess heat in stomach energy and initially administered two doses of the yellow-purging powder, which quickly alleviated the thirst. I then used a combination of Gardenia and<br>Dandellion Decoction, which also reduced the yellowing. Finally, I utilized White Atractylodes Powder, which improved their appetite.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>A young child experienced a fever during the Yin and Mao hours, accompanied by convulsions and phlegm. After taking the Bao Long Xie Qing Er Wan, the child recovered. Later, the same symptoms returned, along with coughing and wheezing, intermittent convulsions, and a flushed or cyanotic face, sometimes with swelling and excessive salivation. I diagnosed the coughing and wheezing as due to deficiency of spleen and lung qi; the intermittent convulsions as liver wood overpowering the spleen; the cyanotic and yellow complexion as liver invading the heart and spleen; and the swelling and salivation as spleen qi deficiency. I used Yi Zhi Wan to nourish the heart&#39;s blood and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to tonify the spleen qi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child experienced fever and palpitations during the Si and Wu hours, appearing fatigued and having a yellow complexion with poor appetite and excessive salivation when drinking soup. I attributed this to insufficient heart qi. When the child did not believe me and instead took cooling heart medicine, the condition worsened with vomiting and diarrhea, and they showed signs of slow onset spleen wind. I initially used Liu Jun Jiang Gui Tang, assisted with Di Huang Wan, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>A third child had a fever and a flushed face during the Shen and You hours, along with abdominal pain. When a harsh medicine was used, it led to convulsions and vomiting of phlegm, with thirst and abdominal pain exacerbated by pressure. This indicated damage to the spleen and stomach resulting in a change in symptoms. I applied Qi Wei Bai Zhu San and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to stability.</p>
<p>A fourth child had a fever during the Hai and Zi hours, appeared fatigued, had a yellow complexion with poor appetite and excessive salivation when drinking soup, and was treated with Yi Huang San, leading to recovery. The illness later recurred despite taking the previous medicine and cooling agents. The child&#39;s state involved frequent illness, excessive sleeping with eyes exposed, thirst, reduced appetite, and frequent yellow stools. This was due to spleen deficiency with liver wood prevailing, in addition to sinking of the original qi. I utilized Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, supplemented with Di Huang Wan, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>A young child had a fever and abdominal distension at night, indicating spleen deficiency and liver excess.

<p>A girl aged fourteen suffered from summer heat following menstruation, experiencing fever, afternoon heat, irritability, thirst, a flushed face, and a pulse that was flooding and large, yet felt empty upon palpation.

<p>A young child often experienced dry mouth and fever every spring and summer, showing lethargy and a desire to sleep, with headaches when exerted. After taking cooling and phlegm-transforming medicine, the child faced wheezing, diarrhea, and restlessness. When given the Xiang Ru Decoction, the pulse was strong, with thoughts clouded. I then modified the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction by removing Sheng Ma and Chai Hu and adding Five-Flavor, Mai Men Dong, and Pao Jiang in one dose; there was no improvement. Adding five fen of cinnamon bark led to recovery, followed by using the Six-Flavor Pill for full healing.</p>
<p>A young child had inherent weakness of the spleen and kidneys and experienced summer heat with irregular urination and defecation. In the morning, the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was employed, and the Rehmannia Pill was used in the evening for recovery.

A combined treatment of Chai Hu and Zhi Zi Powder was administered to both mother and child, resulting in healing.</p>
<p>A young child had a history of food accumulation and suffered from summer heat, showing fatigue, reduced appetite, and irregular stools. In the morning, the Five-Flavor Odd Function Powder was taken, with a slight addition of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, and in the evening, the Four-Flavor Fattening Pill was used for eventual recovery.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>A young child, with a constitution of kidney deficiency, suffered from summer illnesses.

The treatment involved using the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, which was administered to both mother and child, resulting in recovery. Later, due to the wet nurse&#39;s excessive consumption of rich foods, the child developed sores, restlessness, and thirst. First, the treatments included Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, leading to improvement. However, the mother became angry, which caused a severe reaction, so the treatment was adjusted to include Chai Hu and Zhi Zi Powder, along with a modified Xiao Yao San, and the child healed.</p>
<p>In another case, a child who had a summer illness and consumed cold foods suffered severe abdominal pain, leading to convulsions and coldness. The use of Ren Shen Li Zhong Wan resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child experienced thirst after vomiting and diarrhea, with reduced appetite and noticeable weight loss. The Qi Wei Bai Zhu San helped to gradually alleviate thirst; later, adding Wu Wei Yi Gong San with Sheng Ma improved appetite and led to the use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, resulting in nourishment of the muscles.</p>
<p>Another child craved rich foods and sweet flavors, experienced fever and thirst, and had cloudy urine. The treatment included Si Wei Fei Er Wan and was supplemented with Xie Huang San, leading to slight improvements. Afterward, the child suffered from food damage, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea, which required the use of Xiao Shi Wan. With a compromised stomach Qi and reduced appetite, causing fatigue and thirst, first Qi Wei Bai Zhu San was administered to stop the thirst, followed by Wu Wei Yi Gong San, leading to complete recovery.</p>
<p>Lastly, a child with a pale complexion suffered from thirst, productive cough, and fever. Treatments with heat-clearing and phlegm-resolving medicine led to diarrhea and frequent urination, indicating the injury of the spleen and kidneys. In the morning, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was used, and in the evening, Si Shen Wan, resulting in gradual recovery. Additionally, the application of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan led to healing.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>A young child was restless and anxious, suffering from heat and thirst, drinking cold water, and showing a red hue on the forehead. This indicated internal heat of the heart. First, I administered a dose of Xie Xin Tang to alleviate the condition slightly, followed by Chai Hu Zhi Zi San, which brought recovery.</p>
<p>In the year of Jia Jing, during the Jia Yin year, the daughter of a loyal official, aged twelve, suffered from inherent weakness of the spleen and stomach. From summer to autumn, she experienced intermittent diarrhea and slight abdominal pain. By August and September, she developed symptoms of accumulation and heat, with a continuous fever lasting over twenty days. She sweated out the heat, but the fever persisted. The abdomen from the center to the lower area was swollen and hard, with loose stools, wheezing, coughing, and belching, all worsening at night and accompanied by restlessness, nasal congestion, darkening of the eyes, and incoherent speech, leading her family to believe she would surely die. Upon examination, I noted the pulse was large and floating with no root, which indicated severe deficiency. I deemed it necessary to prescribe Shen Tang. </p>
<p>I used one liang of ginseng, three fen of roasted aconite, and three slices of fresh ginger, taken twice a day. This resulted in a significant discharge of the accumulated heat, causing a fishy odor, the abdomen gradually relaxed, and the heat decreased. The pulse began to strengthen but hands continued to tremble, and there was nosebleed. I stated it was a liver condition and prescribed Liu Wei Wan. After one dose, she seemed to have recovered. During the day, she took only the ginseng and ginger soup, and at night, the Liu Wei Wan, her pulse gradually regained strength, and the symptoms lessened.</p>
<p>Before this, her hands and feet were always hot; now she began to feel cold. I was glad to see that the evil was completely expelled and the true qi was apparent. However, she still had no appetite, so I used only Liu Jun Zi Tang with added roasted ginger, enabling her to eat. The cough was particularly severe, so I administered Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which stopped the cough, and she finally slept well and recovered completely at night.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>According to the &quot;Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot;: Luo Qianfu treated a young child whose body was steaming from summer heat, with a full and troubled chest, skin colored like orange peel, and yellowing of the white of the eyes. The child exhibited weak muscles and bones, unable to stand or walk. This condition arose from the summer heat, compounded by humidity, which steamed and obstructed the meridians and penetrated the bone marrow, causing the organ energies to falter. Thus, the spleen seized control over the heart, leading to the combination of damp heat that resulted in this illness. Indeed, when heart fire is excessive, the body steams with heat, the chest is filled with distress, and when spleen dampness prevails, the skin takes on an orange hue. Excess energy must thereby suppress its own weakness; this indicates that the kidneys and liver have been invaded by evil, resulting in weakened muscles and bones, unable to support standing or walking. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that heat in the spleen results in a yellow color and a glutinous texture of the flesh, and it further mentions damp heat leading to atrophy; these words are truly credible! What is said about the son being nourished by the real mother implies that by nourishing the child, one must reduce its condition. Hence, when the spleen’s earth is diminished from its original position, the kidney&#39;s water can return, and the heart&#39;s fire will naturally decrease. Furthermore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; indicates that the treatment for atrophy specifically focuses on the Yangming channel, and this precisely refers to that principle. A modified version of the Xiaohuang San should be used to address this condition.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: My second son was born in the year of Yimao, in the fifth month. In early autumn of that year, he suddenly caught a chill and developed a fever, with a weak and tight pulse. However, knowing that his internal organs were prone to cold, I dared not dispel it directly. So I combined herbs such as Chuanxiong, Suye, Qianghuo, Zhizi, Xixin, and fresh ginger, hoping to dispel his cold. After one dose, not only did his fever not subside, but he developed severe diarrhea instead, which did not stop for two consecutive days and was followed by wheezing; the more he diarrheaed, the more he wheezed. At this moment, I wondered if the cold was too strong. Why did warming herbs lead to diarrhea? Could it be that fire was attacking metal? How could days of clearing and purging still be vulnerable to cold and damp? Was it likely that the exterior pathogen remained? If that were the case, why was there no relief when I attempted to disperse it? At a loss, my anxiety grew. I could see his internal condition was severe; he was wheezing and in danger. How could a simple remedy bring him back? After deep contemplation, I gradually understood some things. I decided to use two qian of ginseng and five slices of fresh ginger, decocted into half a cup of liquid, yet I did not dare to administer it hastily, fearing it would worsen the wheezing and lead to a situation beyond remedy.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>Using a tea spoon, I administered two or three doses, then watched closely as the breaths entered and exited.

After a little while, I noticed that the breathing seemed to ease somewhat, so I boldly gave half a small cup, and then there was a noticeable response. From noon until dusk, I completed this one dose. Just then, a physician arrived in haste, calling out: &quot;Mistake! Mistake! How can someone with such severe wheezing still take ginseng? Quickly use Baolong pills to resolve this.&quot; I agreed but did not heed his advice, and instead, administered two and a half drachms of ginseng, brewing a decoction as before. From dusk until midnight, I completed the dosage. When the medication was finished, the breathing became steady, and he fell into a deep sleep; the cough ceased, and the fever retreated. This teaches us that the wheezing was a result of the diarrheal reaction, indicating a deficiency in the middle. If there were real pathogenic factors, the wheezing would diminish as the diarrhea lessened, which is distinguishable. Had I mistakenly heeded the physician&#39;s advice and switched to cleansing agents, it would have depleted the middle qi, leading to certain danger, and I would have been blamed for wrongly using ginseng. Who is right and who is wrong? How to discern? I record this to demonstrate the efficacy of warming the interior and dispersing cold, showcasing its subtlety.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Huang Di&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Real and Unreal Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: If an infant is ill with heat and has a faint pulse, what should be done?<br>[Note: Those who are ill with heat are generally suffering from conditions related to cold. When one is harmed by cold, they borrow the yang energy to transform the heat; although the heat is intense, it does not lead to death. Yet, the yang energy arises from the essence of water; for boys, this begins at eight years old, and for girls, seven years old, when the kidney energy starts to be substantial. Infants have not reached the stage of menses, and their kidney energy is not strong, hence the Emperor poses this question. The heart governs the pulse and depends on the kidneys for vitality. The energies of water and fire circulate between the heart and the kidneys; when kidney energy cannot support the heart, the heart feels as if it is starving, and the pulse at the wrist becomes faint and weak, indicating the kidney energy is still insufficient.]<br>Qi Bo said: If the hands and feet are warm, one thrives; if they are cold, one perishes.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>【Note: The vitality of a newborn is attributed to the post-natal energy. All limbs derive their energy from the stomach; therefore, when the energy at the extremities is warm, the stomach&#39;s energy is still strong, leading to life. When cold, the stomach&#39;s energy is depleted, resulting in death. When food and drink enter the stomach, bodily fluids follow their respective pathways. The kidneys are the water organ, absorbing the essences of the five organs and storing them, being the essence from pre-natal sources, which is also supplemented by post-natal resources. Furthermore, it differentiates and produces two pathways of nourishment and defense. The great energy that stagnates and does not circulate is called ancestral energy, accumulating in the chest, rising to the lungs to assist with respiration, being the source of vitality for the limbs. Therefore, if the extremities are warm, it indicates life; if cold, it indicates death.】</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What is the pulse like for an infant with wind-heat, wheezing, and shoulder breathing?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;For wheezing and shoulder breathing, the pulse is full and strong. A relaxed pulse indicates life, while a rapid pulse indicates death.&quot; </p>
<p>【Note: This again discusses the importance of the ancestral energy generated after birth, which should not be harmed. Ancestral energy is foundational to the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians, hence its name. Shoulder breathing refers to breathing that causes the shoulders to rise. The pathogenic wind-heat initially harms the skin and hair; wheezing and shoulder breathing occur when wind-heat is strong and internally harms the lung energy and ancestral energy, hence the pulse is full and strong. The calmness of the pulse is due to the stomach energy of the Yangming channel. A rapid pulse indicates that the stomach&#39;s energy has been depleted, resulting in death.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Children&#39;s Direct Prescription</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Qian Yi)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Fever According to the Classics</strong></p>
<p>For tidal fever, the heat comes at a specific time and subsides after the period; it returns at the same time the next day, which indicates a tendency toward convulsions. For persistent fever, the heat does not cease; in severe cases, it can lead to convulsions. In cases of wind-heat, there is body heat accompanied by hot breath, indicating an external wind pathogen. In cases of warm-heat, there is slight heat in the limbs.</p>
<p>If there is fever without thirst, it indicates weakness of stomach qi and internal heat, treated with Bai Zhu San. If there is fever along with thirst, and a preference for cold drinks and food, it indicates excess heat in stomach qi, treated with Xie Huang San. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to the &quot;Secret Collection for Protecting Infants,&quot; persistent tidal or strong fever in children is often due to changes in the body&#39;s inner balance and dynamics among the five viscera, and may not require medication. Excessive food intake can cause internal heat manifesting on the surface, thus treating the internal condition to clear the bright yang heat will help resolve surface heat without mistaking it as an external pathogen; using heavy purging medications like Xiao Chai Hu might harm the internal state instead. If tidal fever is prolonged, it might indicate the onset of smallpox, so careful examination is necessary before using medications. It is suggested that for those with thirst, heat is internal, while those without thirst have external heat. This should be noted for differentiation. Various heat conditions are described in different categories.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>If, after a serious illness, both the body and eyes turn yellow, it is called jaundice. Symptoms include body pain and stiffness in the back, difficult urination and defecation, and a generally yellow appearance with dark yellow urine; this is jaundice. If it results in diarrhea, it is difficult to treat. If, after a hundred days or half a year, the body remains yellow without an underlying illness, it indicates stomach heat causing fetal jaundice; if the yellow is pale combined with white, it indicates a weak stomach. </p>
<p>(Note: After a serious illness, if the body and eyes are all yellow, or if the limbs are swollen and yellow, it signifies spleen deficiency and true organ disease; it is advisable to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction or the Ginseng and Poria Powder to replenish vital energy. If there is thirst after illness, it indicates spleen deficiency and insufficient fluid, so one should use the Seven Flavor Poria Powder. If the spleen channel is damp and hot, causing constipation, and the pores are unable to release, this leads to the condition called jaundice, treated with Yin Chen Decoction. If at birth the body is yellow and hot with constipation, this is due to fetal heat and requires the Rehmannia Decoction. If there is dark and difficult urination with abdominal distension and a red face, accompanied by thirst, use Yin Chen Decoction and adjust with Five-Flavor Powder. If the stool is clear and self-regulating, and the limbs are cold, use the Benefit Yellow Powder; for pale yellow and white, use the Regulate the Center Pill.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment Experience for Pediatric Summer Heat and Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>In children, if the body is steaming with heat, the chest is full and uncomfortable, the skin appears yellow like a rotting orange, and the whites of the eyes are also yellow, when the muscles and bones are weak and unable to stand or walk, this is due to the intense summer heat compounded by dampness, which causes the heat to thin in the meridians, penetrating to the bones and marrow, resulting in imbalance in the vital organs. Hence, the spleen reverses to affect the heart, and the combination of damp heat leads to this illness. Indeed, when the heart fire is excessive, the body steams with heat, the chest is full and uncomfortable, and when spleen dampness dominates, the skin appears yellow like a rotting orange. Any excess energy must overcome what it can overpower, leading to the kidney and liver being invaded, resulting in weak muscles and bones that cannot stand or walk. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that &quot;when there is heat in the spleen, the color is yellow and the flesh wriggles,&quot; and it also states that damp heat causes atrophy—this is truly wise! This is called the child able to make the mother full; when the mother is full, it will drain the child. If the spleen soil retreats to its original position and the kidney water is restored, then the heart fire will also calm down. Furthermore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that the treatment for atrophy is primarily drawn from the yangming channel, and this is indeed the case. I used a modified version of the Yellow Draining Powder as the main treatment.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>In general, when children are ill, they always have a fever. Since the symptoms differ, the treatment must also vary. It is essential to understand whether the condition is due to deficiency or excess, and one must not rashly induce sweating or purging. </p>
<p>For fever caused by a cold, the symptoms include sweating, body heat, yawning, a flushed face, puffy eyes, shortness of breath, and aversion to wind. This is due to the body releasing wind. It is advisable to disperse the wind, relax the muscles, and reduce the fever. First, take Chai Ge Jie Ji Decoction to expel the wind pathogen, and when the fever subsides, take Liang Jing Wan to prevent internal heat.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those with a heat tendency suffer from undigested dairy and food that accumulate internally, resulting in the formation of lumps that generate heat externally. The treatment method is primarily through the use of the Sacred Pill.</p>
<p>In the case of intermittent fever (malaria), there are alternating chills and heat. Symptoms may include headache, sweating, vomiting, loss of appetite, aversion to cold yet feeling hot and thirsty, body aches, abdominal pain, and vomiting or diarrhea. There are numerous manifestations, and treatment is not singular. For headaches with sweating and body aches, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qiang Huo and Cang Zhu is used; for abdominal pain, the Pi Ji Wan is appropriate; for thirst, the Bai Zhu San is beneficial; and for vomiting or diarrhea, the Li Zhong Decoction is recommended. All should also use Ping Xie Yang Pi Wan for adjustment.</p>
<p>For blood heat, fever begins daily around noon and cools throughout the night, indicating heart heat. For mild cases, Daohong San is used; for severe cases, Si Shun Yin is appropriate.</p>
<p>Traditional treatments for heat do not inquire into symptoms. For those with liver and kidney deficiency, Wei Ling Wan and bamboo leaf fried rice soup should be taken; for those with ample original qi, Liang Jing Wan and bamboo leaf light-heart mint soup should be used.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a child falls ill, heat arises; one must understand the root cause of the illness. External wind and cold can provoke heat, while improper diet leads to internal distress. Vomiting, diarrhea, malaria, dysentery, skin issues, and acne may turn into severe boils. With bone heat and body weakness, one gradually becomes exhausted; understanding treatment is crucial.  </p>
<p>If it’s wind and cold affecting them, the face turns red, accompanied by aversion to wind and cold. The efficacy of awakening the child is difficult to articulate, but cough can be treated with herbs like Shen Su. For internal injuries from diet, a decoction containing San Huang can be employed for spleen accumulation. Additionally, the Ji Sheng formula should be added for safety, ensuring the spleen is not weakened and does not turn over.  </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea, the Wei Ling is the best remedy; use herbs like Xiang Lian for red or white dysentery. For malaria, treat with formulas that dispel evils; for skin problems, use Hu Ma Wan powder. When dealing with common childhood diseases like boils, do not hastily use decoctions or pills. If encountering smallpox or measles, consult a different specialist; use the Ji Sheng formula to address lingering illness.  </p>
<p>Treat heat with sweating and avoid mistakes; wrong sweats or purges can be harmful. One should purge when sweating is obstructed, and induce sweating when there are concerns about a sudden purge. Due to a lack of understanding between the exterior and interior, life might be in jeopardy. It is indeed difficult to discern, so one should utilize Wei Ling and Ji Sheng for treatment.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable Remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Fang Xian from the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Management of Pediatric Fevers</strong></p>
<p>When children experience fevers caused by fright, it is often mistakenly attributed to normal conditions, leading to disharmony of the heart&#39;s energy and a slight rise in body temperature. This results in restless sleep and dreamy fright, accompanied by sweating all over. In severe cases, the limbs may twitch and devolve into convulsions. This is due to a lack of harmony between qi and blood, with interior heat present, causing the spirit to be unsettled and resulting in convulsions. Children who experience rapid heat changes also tend to show signs of fright, which is similarly caused by excessive internal heat. </p>
<p>For treatment, remedies such as Seven Treasures Powder, Tianzhu Yellow Powder, Sweet Dew Powder, and Mercury with Gold Leaf Powder can be used. When fright leads to heat, it unsettles the heart, causing disturbed sleep and physical tremors; the heart is startled, leading to actual fever. If the child is in a weak state, they may lie still but be restless. This describes their condition.</p>
<p>Children with fever from &quot;warmth&quot; are often due to disharmony in the stomach qi, causing stagnant qi and accumulation of body heat, referred to as &quot;warmth accumulation.&quot; If the stool is foul-smelling and yellow, it indicates latent heat in the abdomen, to be treated with the Four Harmonizing Decoction. If the stool is pale and sour-smelling, it signifies undigested food; in such cases, Zisha Pills should be taken. For mild cases, a small dose suffices; for severe cases, reduce breastfeeding and increase the herbal dosage, aiming for mild relief.</p>
<p>Children experiencing strong heat are due to heat generated within the five organs and manifesting outwardly, causing generalized warmth in the body. This condition is similar to warmth accumulation but with slight differences.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the warmth is mild and not very intense, it indicates a moderate strength; but if the heat is excessively strong, it can lead to sudden shock. Treatments include Seven Treasures Powder and Dahuang (rhizoma) with Glauber&#39;s salt decoction. </p>
<p>For infants with wind-heat, if the body is warm, face is pale, mouth is hot, and they are irritable and restless, with wind symptoms present, one should use Huojing Pills and Tianzhu Yellow Powder. If the heat is severe and accompanied by constipation, Si Shun Decoction can also be taken. </p>
<p>Irritable and hot infants often suffer from internal heat in the organs, with abundant blood and qi leading to heat on both exterior and interior, causing restlessness and hot skin. Eight Treasures Decoction and Seven Treasures Powder can be administered. </p>
<p>For infants with hot hands and feet, who are irritable and crying with deep red lips, and drink water incessantly, treat them with Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction plus sweet dew powder. </p>
<p>For infants with tidal fever, if they have fever in the afternoon that subsides after a while, only to return at the same time the next day, this points towards a potential shock condition. Generally, it indicates obstruction of blood and qi, with internal organ heat manifesting outwardly, hence the moderate intensity of warmth which may be accompanied by hidden heat or lingering cold. Hidden heat manifests with yellow, foul-smelling stools, and lingering cold presents with white, sour-smelling stools. Both conditions arise from excessive heat in the organs and an accumulation in the intestines and stomach. Treat these with Jinlian Decoction, Kexiao Decoction, and sweet dew powder; if symptoms persist beyond the expected duration, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Qian said: If the tidal heat is due to a solid organ being weak and a hollow organ being weak, then the method should be to tonify the mother and drain the original organ, and it will recover. For instance, when tidal heat arises at noon, it indicates heart deficiency. The liver is the mother of the heart, so first, the liver should be strengthened, and then if the liver is solid, the heart can be drained. The heart, receiving the mother’s energy, will stabilize internally, resolving the tidal heat. </p>
<p>When a physician sees tidal heat and mistakenly thinks it is substantial, he uses cold laxatives like rhubarb and sodium sulfate to purge. Although this may seem effective in the short run, it often depletes bodily fluids, leading to a lack of nourishment and resulting in emaciation and the onset of chronic conditions. </p>
<p>For children with accumulated heat, if both the exterior and interior are hot, the entire body will feel hot, with flushed cheeks, dry mouth, reddish urine, and yellow, scorched stools. One should first give herbal decoctions like Si Shun Yin or San Jie Niu Huang San to assist in moving the organs and dispelling heat. Once the heat is relieved, if abdominal heat remains, it means that the internal heat has subsided but the exterior heat has not. At this point, one should use Jing Jing San or Hong Mian San with a little ephedra to induce mild sweating to dissipate the exterior heat. </p>
<p>If exterior heat is alleviated but fever persists, why is that? Conventional physicians struggle to understand this. Some continue using cooling medicines, others try to release the exterior again, or mistakenly think it cannot be treated, resulting in many cases of premature death.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This table indicates a state of deficiency; the vital energy does not return to its source, and the yang floats externally. Hence there is a resurgence of heat, which is not a true heat condition. One should use Yigong San combined with glutinous rice decoction to harmonize the stomach&#39;s energy, thereby drawing the yang energy inward and cooling the body. For severe heat, use Chén Shā (cinnabar) and Jīn Bó (gold leaf) powder or Qián&#39;s Bái Zhú powder.</p>
<p>For children with deficient heat, after an illness has subsided, their blood and Qi may not yet be balanced, leading to weakness and frequent episodes of heat. The treatment should focus on regulating Qi and tonifying deficiency to allow the heat to naturally subside, using formulas like Qián&#39;s Bái Zhú San, Yigong San, or Si Jūn Zǐ Tāng; if not subsiding, using Ginseng and Shēng Xī (fresh rhinoceros horn) is advisable.</p>
<p>For children with excess heat, symptoms include dizziness, flushed cheeks, oral heat, red and scanty urination resembling bean juice, hard or constipated stools, or abdominal urgency, indicating excess heat. Treatment should involve Sì Shùn Yǐn Zǐ, Dà Huáng (rhubarb) and Xǐo (sodium) decoction, Bā Zhēn San, and gentle movements of the viscera for relief.</p>
<p>Children with &quot;Kǎn heat&quot; show signs of fever and emaciation, excessive thirst, and insufficient food intake that fails to nourish the body. This condition manifests after three or four years of age. Treatment should involve Jīn Guā Wán, Yù Chán Wán, or Féi Ér Wán for the best results.</p>
<p>For purely yang children, who do not show signs of deficiency or emaciation, the use of warm tonics is limited. Previous scholars discussed fourteen indicators of febrile illnesses in children, providing many effective formulas. Contemporary practitioners should follow the insights of the ancients, observing physical signs, assessing color, taking pulses, and diagnosing accurately to differentiate between exterior and interior deficiencies and excesses. Misdiagnosis not only risks the lives of the young but also deceives one&#39;s conscience!<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Children&#39;s Questions on Heat Symptoms</h3>
<p>In children&#39;s illnesses, heat is most prominent. There are two types of heat: true heat and false heat. True heat presents with a flushed face, a yellowish complexion, rough breathing, a hot mouth, dry thirst, swollen lips, difficulty with urination and defecation, and restlessness with loud crying. False heat shows a pale, bluish face, lethargy, coolness in the mouth, weak breath, frequent urination and diarrhea, and night sweats. Sometimes, symptoms may alternate between hot and cold, with agitation and anxiety, strong upper body heat, and weak lower body symptoms; this indicates an imbalance of heat and cold.</p>
<p>For false heat, administer &quot;Bai Du San&quot; with added Mu Xiang and Dang Gui. If both internal and external heat are present, with a yellow complexion and red cheeks, dry lips, a dry mouth, red and scanty urine, and dark yellow stool, first use &quot;Si Shun Qing Liang Yin&quot; to clear and relieve this heat. If the exterior symptoms are not resolved, one should use &quot;Xing Xing San&quot; with a little Ma Huang to induce sweating; if the exterior heat has dissipated using &quot;Chai Hu San,&quot; then harmonizing the body will balance the heat. For symptoms like shock heat, wind heat, and accumulated heat, &quot;Kuan Re San&quot; may be taken to expel heat, and &quot;Bao Shou San&quot; or &quot;Jin Fen San&quot; can be used to reduce residual heat.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Wave</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: The heat wave occurs periodically, appearing at specific times and subsiding afterward, returning again at the expected time. This is a desire to express surprise. The onset of the heat wave resembles the fever of malaria, hence it is generally called a heat wave. It manifests in cycles, and its heat has three sources: the warmth of the body’s nutrients (Rong), the warmth of the protective qi (Wei), and the heat from pestilential miasma. It may return every two days or every three days, and is treated with pear syrup drinks. Wang&#39;s teachings suggest that the heat wave is due to stagnant blood and qi within the internal organs, generating heat that surfaces outward, thereby causing fever. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states that the heat wave is real heat, which should be alleviated by promoting bowel movements, using prescriptions such as Da Chai Hu Decoction or Cheng Qi Decoction. For virtual heat, treatment should be based on Di Gu Pi Powder, Xie Jiao Drink, Bieh Jia Powder, Ling Xi Drink, Qin Jiao Drink, and Sheng Xi Powder. The &quot;Seng Ji Jing&quot; recommends the Di Gu Pi Drink and Qiang Huo Cake among others.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive Heat and Mild Heat</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang stated: Excessive heat is continuous and unrelenting, potentially leading to seizures. Mild heat, on the other hand, is only warm and not overly hot. Chao’s commentary indicates that in children, excessive heat is due to intense qi, radiating outward, hence causing a robust sensation throughout the body. The onset is sudden, resembling mild heat with minimal differences, except that it becomes more severe. In such cases, it is advisable to take mild medications such as Xingxing Powder or Qiang Huo Powder; in severe cases, one can use formulas containing Huang Qin, Chai Hu, and Gan Ge to dispel the heat. Mild heat occurs due to imbalances in children&#39;s internal organs, with hidden heat or lingering cold, all affecting the stomach qi, leading to disharmony. The stagnation of qi causes accumulated heat in the body, termed mild heat.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the stool is yellow and foul, it indicates lurking heat within. If the stool is white and has a sour smell, it suggests lingering cold, which should be warmed; it is advisable to take the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added cinnamon for treatment. For lurking heat, both Wuling San and Baihu Tang are effective. If there is lurking heat causing fullness in the abdomen, Chai Ling San should be used. If the heart and spirit are unsettled, with heat accumulating in the large intestine, Erhuang Xijiao San is indicated. If there is persistent heat that does not subside, Niuhuang San should be employed. If residual heat after resolving constipation remains, Ge Gu Pi San or Huanglong Tang may be taken; Niuhuang Gao also treats strong heat, while Zhizhi Lingyang Jiao Tang addresses various sudden strong heat responses. For persistent heat after bowel movements, accompanied by strong body heat and pain in the joints, combinations of Zhi Zi Ren Tang, Da Lian Qiao Yin, Liu Wu Huangqin Tang, and Wu Wu Ren Shen Yin should be selected based on symptoms. The ancient method for dispelling lurking heat uses Long Dan Tang, and for eliminating retained stagnation, Zi Shuang Wan is very effective. The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; recommends the use of Sheng Ma, Shao Yao, and other herbs for treatment.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Restlessness</h3>
<p>It is said: &quot;Restlessness is caused by heat in the heart; agitation arises from wind in the heart.&quot; When there is heat in the heart, the spirit becomes confused, leading to inner discomfort and anxiety. When the heart is disturbed, it fills up, and naturally, fear arises. Agitation, on the other hand, is due to wind evils affecting the heart, also causing confusion in the mind and resulting in restlessness. More heat leads to unrest; prolonged anxiety brings fear; more wind leads to instability; prolonged agitation results in spasms. </p>
<p>The treatment method involves cooling the heart, reducing excess heat, and facilitating urination, which is optimal. For severe heat, the Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction is recommended; for lighter cases, the Dao Chi San or Yu Lu San can be used. If wind-heat is present, Zhi Bao Dan, Hu Po San, or Jie Du Wan can be taken; for those with cold damage symptoms, a combination of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and Bai Hu Decoction, omitting Da Huang but adding Gan Gan can be effective. For those experiencing fever and fright, Jin Bo Zhen Xin Wan and Qi Wu Huang Lian Decoction are particularly beneficial.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Thirst Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>It is discussed that for children suffering from thirst, if their lips appear red like vermilion for three to five parts, they are slightly thirsty; if the redness is severe, their thirst is intense. Lips that are both red and charred black indicate prolonged thirst with excessive heat, leading to a rapid and extreme deterioration in their condition. Generally, when a child has a deficiency in the Sanjiao (three energizers) causing restlessness and thirst, with persistent drinking, it is appropriate to use Sanhuang Pills. If a child experiences thirst after contracting a cold with charred lips and significant dryness and agitation, Baihu Decoction is the main prescription; Zhulei Decoction can also be administered. For children who suffer from diarrhea leading to thirst, Wuling Powder with the removal of cinnamon, and the addition of kudzu is particularly effective. Xiangru Decoction and Cheqianzi Powder can both be used; Xiaochaihu Decoction with the addition of tianhuafen is also good, and adding kudzu is even more stable. For those who experience intense heat, restlessness, and thirst, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction is suitable, as well as Qiwuhuanglian Decoction, which is very stable. In general, children are inherently robust and prone to generate heat, resulting in thirst and the urge to drink.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p>Zhong Yang says: If there is body pain, a strong backache, difficulty with urination and bowel movements, and the entire body turns yellow, with the face and nails also yellow, the urine resembling the color of dust from a house, and everything turns yellow upon contact, it is difficult to treat if there is thirst. This is jaundice. Most cases are prevalent after serious illness. There is another case, where a person is slightly yellow after birth within a hundred days or the first six months, not due to illness, which indicates stomach heat, and this applies to adults as well. Furthermore, if there is a yellow face and a swollen abdomen, coupled with vomiting and thirst, it indicates spleen disease. Another case is when a newborn has jaundice, which is fetal jaundice. All jaundice conditions indicate heat, and those with a deep yellow color are the most severe. If the color is light yellow mixed with white, it indicates a weak and unbalanced stomach. The treatment includes Yin Chen Decoction, Gardenia and Cortex Ponciri Decoction, Rhino Horn Powder, and Forsythia and Red Bean Decoction. For general treatment of jaundice, Yin Chen and Wu Ling Powder is especially steady. Additionally, if there is weakness of the spleen with yellowing and clear urination, treatment should involve warming agents, primarily using Angelica Pills or Decoction; Xiao Ban Xia Decoction can also be used. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>潮热</strong>  </p>
<p>Childhood tidal fever, or persistent high fever, often arises from internal transformations and the conflict among the five organs, and does not necessarily require medication. It is also commonly due to dietary stagnation, with internal heat expressing outward, manifesting on the skin. One should address the internal issue and clear the heat of the clear yang to remove the surface heat; it should not be mistaken for an external pathogen, as rashly inducing sweating with small doses of Chai Hu and similar herbs can harm the internal constitution. Persistent tidal fever may signal the emergence of rash, and one should carefully examine the situation and refrain from hastily using medicine! </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the condition arises from dietary stagnation, or is accompanied by abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea, or abdominal distention, it is advisable to use Baohuan Pills to eliminate stagnation and strengthen the spleen. If the diet is cleared, but there is abdominal pain with no appetite or abdominal distention, it is appropriate to use the Four Gentlemen decoction to nourish the stomach qi. If excessive sweating or purgation has harmed the original qi, it is recommended to use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, dried tangerine peel, and licorice to replenish the central qi. Generally, food injury must damage the spleen and stomach, and one should stabilize the stomach qi to prevent further complications. </p>
<p>Tidal heat occurring between the hours of Yin (1-3 AM) and Mao (5-7 AM) belongs to the liver channel; heat during the periods of Si (9-11 AM), Wu (11 AM-1 PM), and Wei (1-3 PM) pertains to the heart channel; heat from Shen (3-5 PM), You (5-7 PM), and Xu (7-9 PM) relates to the lung channel; heat during the hours of Hai (9-11 PM), Zi (11 PM-1 AM), and Chou (1-3 AM) is linked to the kidney channel. One must carefully assess the deficiency and excess to treat accordingly. For conditions classified as deficient heat or excess heat, if treatments are initiated without results in worsening or improvement, it likely indicates a deeply rooted issue not reached by the medication, thus requiring prolonged treatment. Once the efficacy arrives, all ailments will recede, and it is crucial not to switch to other treatments. Should the medicine not align with the symptoms, the consequences can be dire, so one must be cautious!<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu stated: Yang jaundice presents with red and sparse urination, body heat, indicating a struggle between the spleen&#39;s earth and the heart&#39;s fire, classified as a Yang disease. The treatment should first promote urination and then induce defecation. For treating jaundice with abdominal distention, use Yin Chen Hao Decoction combined with Wu Ling San. If the goal is to promote urination, omit Da Huang; if to promote defecation, add Da Huang or similar substances. If there are Yang symptoms, such as a flushed face when drinking water, it can be treated with this method. Yin jaundice, however, is characterized by spontaneous bowel movements, yellowing of the face and body, and cold limbs, indicating spleen deficiency unable to control kidney water; use Yi Huang San and Shi Jun Zi Wan. For pale yellow with white, indicating disharmony in the stomach, administer Ping Wei San or Tiao Zhong Wan. If there is thirst, use Ren Shen Bai Zhu San.</p>

<p>For children with intense fever and drowsiness, suffering from both wind-heat and rashes or food injuries, these symptoms can be similar, making differentiation difficult. Intermittently administer Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang, Xing Xing San, or Xiao Chai Hu Tang, as they are effective in general treatment without causing misdiagnosis. However, for food injuries, there may be sour and foul-smelling stool, poor digestion, aversion to food, or vomiting, in which case medication should be taken to address these issues.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The warm wind resembles heat. The warm wind leads to a condition where the body is not hot but the breath in the mouth feels hot. There is also a warm wind syndrome, which is warm but not hot. </p>

In cold damage with fever, the tips of the fingers are cold, the nose runs clear mucus, there is fever without sweating, the face appears pale and shaken, and the right cheek has purple lines. </p>

<p>Pediatric illnesses are predominantly related to heat. Heat may be of various types: tidal heat, shock heat, night heat, residual heat, food heat, consumption heat, vigorous heat, irritative heat, accumulated heat, wind heat, empty heat, guest heat, obstructive heat, cold heat, blood heat, and rash heat, totaling sixteen types that are largely similar but with minor differences.

Nighttime heat arises in the evening and subsides by dawn, but residual heat and cold pathogens persist. When hot food is consumed, it first affects the stomach and abdomen, leading to heat and bone steaming, causing night sweats. Continuous strong heat does not subside, resulting in agitation and anxiety. Accumulated heat causes flushed cheeks and mouth sores; wind heat leads to sweating and body heat. Deficient heat results in fatigue and weakness, while guest heat fluctuates. Phlegm heat causes coughing and thirst, with chills alternating like malaria. Blood heat may lead to fever and eventually to ear and nose coldness with sores and rashes. Each symptom manifests distinctly, though some may overlap; treatment should be adjusted according to severity.</p>

If one is quiet during the day but experiences fever and restlessness at night, it indicates that yang energy has sunk into yin; if one experiences fever and restlessness during the day but is quiet at night, it indicates an abundance of yang without yin, and yang must be urgently purged while yin is strongly replenished. If there is body heat, a tense pulse, trembling, and no aversion to cold, it indicates damp malaria; if there is fever, aversion to cold, and a floating rapid pulse, it indicates a warm disease. If the limbs are hot, and the mouth, tongue, and throat are dry, it indicates fire heat overwhelming the earth element, resulting in combined heat and dampness, hence the restlessness and confusion; if the body feels heavy, with swelling and pain, this results from heat and dampness clashing, as wind heat becomes blocked and cannot be released.</p>

<p>When there is false heat, one tends to like warmth and dislike cold, experiencing alternating sensations of cool and warm, feelings of suffocation and anxiety, symptoms of excess above and deficiency below, curling up to sleep with eyes exposed, and coldness in hands and feet, among other signs. False heat occurs after an illness, presenting with persistent fever several times a day. This is due to pathogenic heat occupying a vacuity. First, take a warming herbal decoction with Astragalus powder, mixed with warm, clear rice soup; then administer Qian&#39;s White Atractylodes Powder, or Guhong Decoction, to be taken cool; also, use warm salty water mixed with cool water, and take along with Heixidan to consolidate original qi. For wind-heat and evil heat, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with fresh ginger and Schizonepeta decocted. For children with internal heat, start with Daohong Powder and then use Yihuang Powder. Xue&#39;s distinction between true and false, as well as heat obstructing Yin, cold obstructing Yang, and symptoms of blood deficiency and qi deficiency causing fever, aligns with the diagnostic practices of esteemed physicians like Zhongjing and Dongyuan. It is recommended to study and familiarize oneself with these methods carefully so as to avoid misidentifying false heat as true heat, thus preserving the well-being of the many.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The residual heat refers to the lingering heat transmitted through the channels by the unfinished cold pathogens. Ren Zhai states: after a cold injury, when sweating and purging have occurred but heat reappears, both the exterior and interior are deficient, qi does not return to its source, and yang is floating outside, making it inappropriate to use cooling medicines again. The ancient sages warned that when heat departs, cold arises. The proper approach is to harmonize the stomach qi, allowing the yang qi to gather inward, which will naturally stop the heat. The formula Shen Ling Bai Zhu San should be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>In cases of children with heat syndrome, after using both exterior and interior medications, if the heat completely subsides and then reappears, what is the reason? Heat diseases at this stage are difficult to generalize. Some may require re-expelling the exterior and attacking the interior, or applying cooling agents, which can intensify the heat. To differentiate between yin and yang, which is the correct approach? Upon investigation, it is found that both the exterior and interior are deficient, with yang floating outside and yin hidden within, leading to renewed heat. It is suitable to use warming and balancing medicines to harmonize the interior, allowing bodily heat to naturally resolve. The Qian family’s Bai Zhu San should be prepared without mu xiang, boiled in water, alongside Huang Qi Liu Yi Decoction and An Shen San, to allow for natural recovery.</p>
<p>If sweating excessively leads to blood deficiency and worsens heat, add glutinous rice to Liu Shen San; if sweating causes qi deficiency with aversion to cold and fever, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for sweating with yin deficiency and no support for yang, use Si Wu Decoction with Ren Shen and Huang Qi; if sweating results in yang deficiency and no support for yin, use Si Jun Zi Decoction with Chuan Xiong and Gui.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heat has its onset and cessation; it appears daily at the appropriate times, known as tidal heat, like the tide that does not fail to arrive on schedule. Tidal heat can be differentiated into categories: wind-heat, damp-heat, food stagnation, each influenced by yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and the various organs. For example, if sweating and body heat are present with yawning and a flushed face, it indicates wind-heat; in cases of epidemic diseases or exogenous heat, yin and yang conflict leads to external heat; symptoms like emaciation, dry mouth, and bone steaming with night sweats signify damp-heat; constipation or diarrhea with unresolved sweating indicates accumulated heat; abdominal and back heat that arises at night and ceases by dawn relates to drinking of heat; if there is phlegm and cough, inability to digest milk, it pertains to food stagnation heat.</p>
<p>Additionally, those with vexatious heat manifest coarse breathing, a rapid pulse, restlessness, red cheeks, mouth sores, and may also experience seizures; skin rash heat results in cold tips of the ears and nose; blood heat presents at midday, cooling down by night; deficient heat leads to fatigue and weakness, emerging after illness. Yang pathogens disturb the heart leading to irregularities, and the conflict of yin and yang results in alternating cold and heat similar to malaria.</p>
<p>In children, such symptoms may arise from the mother’s excessive emotions or rich diets during pregnancy, or from dietary stagnation, overly warm bedding, and frequent hot baths. If heat occurs during the hours of Yin (3-5 AM) or Mao (5-7 AM) with vigorous drinking, it indicates excess heat in the liver channel; use Chai Hu Qing Gan San. If heat is present but with weakness while drinking soup, it indicates deficiency heat in the liver channel; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If heat appears during the hours of Si (9-11 AM) or Wu (11 AM-1 PM), it relates to the heart channel; use Dao Chi San for excess, and Mi Zhi An Shen Wan for deficiency. If heat arises during the hours of Shen (3-5 PM), Xu (5-7 PM), or Hai (9-11 PM), it implicates the lung channel; use Xie Bai San for excess, and Mi Zhi Bao Pi Tang for deficiency. If heat appears during the hours of Zi (11 PM-1 AM), Chou (1-3 AM), it relates to the kidney channel; use Di Huang Wan.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, if one has a strong fever accompanied by thirst and constipation, it indicates excess heat. To treat this, administer the Erhuang Xijiao San to clear it. If there is heat and thirst but normal stools, this suggests blood deficiency, and the Siwu Decoction should be used for supplementation. If there is deficiency after treatment, with yang failing to support and heat persisting, add Renshen and Huangqi to the Siwu Decoction. If sweating leads to yang deficiency, where yin fails to generate heat yet there is still warmth, use the Sijunzi Decoction with Xuangui. In cases of thirst, flushed face, and irritability post-sweating, this indicates blood deficiency causing agitation; the Danggui Bu Xue Tang is appropriate. If there are signs of shock or convulsions, indicating liver blood deficiency and internal wind, utilize the Siwu Decoction along with Tianma and Diaoteng. For a flushed face, dry mouth, red urine, and scorched yellow stools, indicating heat both inside and outside, employ the Qingliang Yinzi. If stools have improved or heat persists while the external pathogen is unresolved, the Xing Xing San should be applied; if needed, add a slight amount of Mahuang for mild sweating. If there is continued heat post-sweating, this shows deficiency inside and outside, with qi not returning to its source, and yang floating outside leading to false heat; apply the Liu Shen San with polished rice. If the yang energy descends into the yin and causes fever, the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang should be administered. If treating a nursing infant, also treat the mother.</p>
<p>The Zeng family first used Baijie San for the exterior, then applied Danggui San and Sanjie San for further treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Daytime Heat</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Complete Pediatric Formulas&quot;: When children experience a fever after eating in the morning and are cool at night, many doctors attribute this to deficiency-induced labor or malnutrition heat, not realizing that this is a case of blood heat. It is advisable to administer Long Dan Pills or Rehmannia paste, which, when taken regularly, will lead to recovery. According to &quot;Complete Pediatric Formulas,&quot; blood heat refers to fever occurring at the hour of the Snake (9 AM to 11 AM) and Horse (11 AM to 1 PM), which then cools at night, differing from Dongyuan&#39;s description of fever at night and clarity during the day. The explanation from Shuyuan points to blood heat as arising from Yin deficiency creating internal heat; thus, fever at night and clarity during the day reflects the cycle of Yin at night and Yang during the day. Zheng&#39;s interpretation of blood heat refers to children having abundant and full blood. The reason for referencing the hours of the Snake and Horse is due to the heart&#39;s fire being active at this time. The heart governs blood, and when the blood and Qi circulate to the hours of the Snake and Horse, Yang energy is strong, clashing with the righteous Qi, which causes the fever at that designated time. If it occurs outside this period, it is not considered blood heat.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Night Heat</strong></p>
<p>Hai Cangyun: Night heat belongs to Yin; among the four seasons, it is related to drinking, which indicates that this blood heat occurs at night. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states that if there is residual food in the small intestine, there will be a tendency to heat in the evening, which will stop by the following day; this is the night heat from residual food. Wind phlegm heat causes evening heat and morning coolness with irregular water intake; this situation suggests that phlegm brings about wind heat, and it is appropriate to administer the Jinxing Pill. If the Qi is weak, do not purge; instead, use the Duoming Powder to control the salivation, followed by the Xingsheng Powder with added Nansheng and Baifuzhi.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulated Heat</strong></p>
<p>Accumulated heat refers to persistent heat. Consumption heat also lasts long but is accompanied by a sallow complexion, similar to eating charcoal or earth, with ulcers under the nose. For children with both exterior and interior heat, if fever reappears after the exterior has been addressed, this is not a heat syndrome. Use the Liu Shen Powder into polished rice decoction to harmonize their stomach Qi, which returns the Yang inward, making the body cool. For those with severe heat, use the Yinbai Powder. Accumulated heat can lead to puffy eyelids, a sallow face, and cold feet, with fever emanating from the head to the abdomen, possibly accompanied by food odors, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Treatment methods are detailed in the discussion on injury from accumulation. According to Zeng, the so-called accumulated heat refers to heat from intestinal masses and differs from long-standing accumulation, and they may coexist.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>Cold and heat refer to symptoms resembling those of malaria, arising from the struggle between yin and yang. When cold comes first and heat follows, it indicates insufficient yang; when heat comes first and cold follows, it indicates insufficient yin. When there is more cold and less heat, yin overcomes yang; when there is more heat and less cold, yang overcomes yin. When cold and heat are balanced, yin and yang are in mutual conflict. If cold and heat alternate daily, yin and yang are briefly separated; when yang is strong, it causes heat, and when yin is strong, it causes cold. Symptoms may include headache with sweating, vomiting with loss of appetite, increased cold with drinking water, intense heat with consumption of soup, or muscle and joint pain. There may be diarrhea or constipation, or internal cold with external heat, or internal heat with external cold. Furthermore, there are cases where one feels cold with abdominal pain and heat with rumbling in the abdomen, indicating food accumulation. For treating food accumulation, one should use white flour for expelling it; then proceed with reinforcement using Qian&#39;s white atractylodes powder. For conditions of more cold and less heat, Xiao chaihu decoction with cinnamon should be used; for more heat and less cold, Baihu decoction with cinnamon; for balanced cold and heat, Xiao chaihu decoction should be the principal remedy. The classics state: When yang is deficient, external cold arises; when yin is deficient, internal heat arises; when yang is strong, external heat arises; when yin is strong, internal cold arises. The alternation of cold and heat indicates the struggle between yin and yang. Therefore, cold associated with yin causes cold symptoms, while warmth associated with yang causes heat symptoms.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The inch pulse is weak, indicating insufficient Yang, and when Yin energy rises into Yang, it leads to aversion to cold; the ruler pulse is weak, indicating insufficient Yin, and when Yang energy descends into Yin, it causes fever. Insufficient Yang leads to cold first and then heat, while insufficient Yin leads to heat first and then cold. When Yin and Yang do not return to their proper divisions, cold and heat struggle against each other. Additionally, if the upper part is excess, it manifests as fever; if the lower part is excess, it manifests as cold. When Yang is dominant, there is sudden heat; when Yin is dominant, there is sudden cold. If Yin and Yang overcome each other and the deficiencies and excesses are unbalanced, then evil Qi arises, causing alternating cold and heat, resulting in sudden cold and sudden heat.</p>
<p>The Shao Yang gallbladder is a part of the liver’s organs, situated between the Tai Yang and Yang Ming, half superficial and half internal, making it easier for Yin and Yang energies to interact. Consequently, cold and heat often dominate liver and gallbladder syndromes, which can be adjusted with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, modified as needed. If only cold and heat are evident, and daily life remains unchanged, prolonged illness without recovery, along with post-serious illness where the Yuan Qi has not restored, indicates Yin deficiency generating heat and Yang deficiency generating cold; thus, it is advisable to use Ba Zhen Decoction for nourishment, and in severe cases, Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. </p>
<p>If there&#39;s food stagnation causing illness, it can also result in cold and heat, which can be resolved with Bao He Wan; if there are accompanying symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction. For critical cold with hot beverages, Ren Shen Li Zhong Wan is effective. If thirst persists, use Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. After food stagnation is resolved but cold and heat still persist, it suggests that liver evil is overpowering the spleen, indicating a deficiency where it is not overcome; in this case, use Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu and Shan Zhi Zi. For malaria symptoms of alternating cold and heat, refer to the section on malaria.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Restlessness</strong></p>
<p>Zhongjing said: When fire enters the lungs, it causes restlessness; when it enters the kidneys, it causes agitation. The heart is the monarch fire; when the fire is vigorous, the metal (lungs) is incinerated, and when the water is depleted, the fire alone persists, thus the lungs and kidneys come together to result in agitation. The &quot;Living Person&quot; states: When one feels hot and restless, it is due to deficiency and agitation. Various instances of deficiency, agitation, and heat resemble those of cold damage, but there is no aversion to cold, and there is no nasal pain; hence, it is known not to be cold damage. There is no headache, and the pulse is not tight, thus it is known not to be internal cold. Sweating and purging are inappropriate; rather, it should be treated with Bamboo Leaf Decoction; if there is also vomiting, use Tangerine Peel Decoction. Furthermore, if the heart is deficient, there will be restlessness followed by thirst, with heat rising and the pulse being floating, tight, and large. Here, agitation arises from inner disturbance and internal heat, hence it is attributed to yang; restlessness involves the limbs being agitated, or a desire to enter a well naked, being outward heat, hence it is attributed to yin. External heat is a fire without root, thus it represents deficiency. When the pulse is rapid and solid, with constipation and heat, use Shenxiong Pill; these are all treatments for solid heat. If there is restlessness with headache, shortness of breath, dry mouth, and throat without thirst, this indicates deficiency; use Four Ginseng Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Angelica. If thirst arises from the medicinal attack, use Bamboo Shoots Decoction. For restlessness and inability to sleep, use Sour Jujube Seed Decoction. For disturbance of the spirit, with restlessness and desire to vomit, use Cinnabar Peaceful Spirit Pill. If the face is flushed, eyes are red within, with all six pulses being large and floating, pressing them yields nothing, indicating blood deficiency leading to restlessness, use Angelica Blood Nourishing Decoction. If agitated and desiring to enter a well naked, with a pulse that is deep and fine or floating and large, pressing gives no response, this indicates excessive yin leading to agitation; it is thus advisable to use Ginseng and A附 Decoction, which has restorative effects.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes on Late Summer</strong></p>
<p>The spleen is associated with the Taiyin, situated in the Earth element, favoring dryness and disliking dampness. Therefore, when the spleen and stomach qi is insufficient, encountering the humid and sultry conditions of late summer hinders the rising of clear yang and the healthy movement of the central qi. Additionally, during the time of the slight yang fire, heat can injure the original qi, leading to lethargy in the limbs, weakness in the feet, excessive sleeping accompanied by fever, a lack of spirit, little appetite, tastelessness in the mouth, shortness of breath, blurriness in vision, frequent and red urination, and irregular bowel movements. This condition is called &quot;Late Summer Affliction.&quot; These symptoms all reflect a deficiency of yin and original qi. Danxi discusses the treatment in detail regarding the nurturing of children; should one not also know the method of nurturing yang in winter? The treatment method involves the use of the &quot;Ba Zhen Tang&quot; (Eight Treasures Decoction) by removing the herbs Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, and adding the roasted black Huang Bo as the main ingredient.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

If a nursing mother has liver fire disturbing the spleen and experiences chills, heat, and poor appetite, use the Chai Hu and Gardenia Powder; if there is thirst due to stomach fire, use the Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. Children often suffer due to the imbalanced qi of their nursing mothers, so they must avoid anger, regulate diet, and adjust to cold and warmth to prevent illness. Nowadays, people commonly use fragrant rush decoction as a cold infusion to replace tea in summer. However, they are unaware that fragrant rush promotes diuresis and greatly diminishes original yang; magnolia bark can inhibit and cause significant depletion of true qi. Moreover, the spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold; in summer, when yang is abundant internally, drinking cold can harm the spleen. Those with strong stomachs and fire, or those suffering from damp-heat ailments, may not experience significant harm, but those with weak spleens and stomachs, or insufficient central qi, are likely to suffer from abdominal pain, reduced appetite, and diarrhea caused by cold.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the stomach&#39;s qi is harmonious and food intake increases, the essence is transformed and refined, nourishing the body and irrigating the organs. The five colors manifest in their respective parts, and the essence and vitality are expressed in one’s appearance, with any yellowish hue fading away. The classics say: &quot;The central yellow corresponds to the spleen.&quot; Therefore, jaundice is the color of the spleen. The spirit of a person is more precious when it is contained and quietly utilized; when it is seen externally, it indicates internal deficiency. This is all due to a deficiency of spleen qi, where transformation and transportation fail, causing dampness and heat to linger in the skin, resulting in jaundice. As Qian Zhongyang stated, symptoms like body aches, back weakness, and yellowing of the skin, face, and nails indicate this condition, with brownish urine being difficult to treat.

<p><strong>General Theories on Child Health</strong></p>
<p>When a child has body heat that is warm but not excessively strong, this is classified as a warm heat. If the child&#39;s body heat is accompanied by a hot sensation in the mouth, continuous crying, yawning, signs of restlessness, and a bluish complexion, this indicates wind heat, which may also lead to fright. If the child exhibits body heat with anxiety over drinking water, trembling hands and feet, looking upwards while moving the tongue, visible blue veins on the inner hands, red palms, and fear of objects causing salivation, this is deemed startling heat. If a child has body heat with a red face that does not subside over time, disturbed sleep with cries, rapid breathing and thirst, elevated chest with phlegm stagnation, this represents accumulated heat. It resembles strong heat but is distinct due to the phlegm accumulation in the elevated chest, indicating a build-up of heat and toxins in the organs, causing stagnation in the three burners. Also, if the child shakes their head and has a stiff neck, it too indicates stagnation in the three burners. All of the above may lead to convulsions in severe cases, and treatment should be approached through the gate of fright and convulsion.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child has a fever, experiences shortness of breath, nasal congestion, clear runny nose, sneezing, chills, tearing, or possibly produces phlegm, this is classified as a cold injury, treated according to the protocols for a cold injury.</p>
<p>If a child has a fever that comes and goes, with a hot belly during the fever; or if they have a nighttime fever with a yellow face, abdominal bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, and food not digesting well, with a sour and foul-smelling stool, this indicates food injury, treated according to the protocols for food injury.</p>
<p>When a child has a nighttime fever that resolves by morning, excessive salivation, and seems to enjoy sleeping, this suggests that the child has a deficiency of the lungs causing the fever, which can resemble a food injury. It is crucial to differentiate between the two, as the residual symptoms vary: in food injury, one can use purgatives; in lung deficiency, one should not, as doing so will lose vital fluids, causing thirst and a desire for drinks. </p>
<p>In the past, Qian Yi treated a five-year-old who had a nighttime fever that resolved by morning. Many physicians characterized it as a heat condition and prescribed cooling medicines, but it did not improve.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The patient had excessive salivation and frequent spitting, and when medicine was administered to reduce the saliva, the illness worsened. After five or six days, I asked Yi to treat him. Yi said: &quot;Do not administer a laxative.&quot; He then prepared three sheng of decoction from Atractylodes powder, allowing the patient to take as much as he needed. Zhu asked: &quot;If he drinks too much, won’t it cause diarrhea?&quot; Yi replied: &quot;With no living water, it cannot cause diarrhea. Even if there is a discharge, it is not alarming; just don’t use a laxative!&quot; Zhu further inquired: &quot;What illness was treated first?&quot; Yi responded: &quot;To stop diarrhea, treat phlegm, reduce fever, and calm the spirit—all with this medicine.&quot; After the prescription was fully taken, it was given again twice, and the child was no longer thirsty and had no phlegm. Then, two doses of Ejiao powder were given, and he was at peace. This is indicative of that condition. This is recorded in the collected works of Qian Yi. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a young child has a slight fever and is slightly startled, with cold ears and white blisters appearing on the upper lip like fish eyes, and either has sweat or does not, this indicates a condition called &quot;transformation steaming,&quot; which is treated under the category of &quot;transformation steaming.&quot;</p>
<p>When a child has a fever, is lethargic and startled, enjoys sneezing, and has cold ears, this indicates symptoms of measles, treated under the category of &quot;measles.&quot; This is similar to illness caused by food injury leading to transformation steaming, where cold ears are hot in cases of cold damage, while the dual steaming with white warts and blisters on the lips is different.</p>
<p>Fever in children may derive from both internal and external causes. Internal causes often arise from excessive water consumption, while external causes are typically due to wind and cold. According to Qian, when a child has an internal fever and drinks a lot of water, it indicates internal heat, while if a child has a fever and does not drink water, it indicates external heat. This is a general diagnostic principle. For internal causes, treatment should focus on purging, while for external causes, treatment should focus on dispersing.</p>
<p>Yan Xiaozhong discusses the patterns of high fever from wind chill and illnesses like warm epidemic and cold damage, as well as wind-heat measles and food injury, which are all quite similar and often difficult to distinguish. However, treatments like Shengma Gegen Decoction, Xingsingsan, and Xiao Chaihu Decoction have proven to be very effective.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>These several medicines can be used for treatment without causing harm. For those with dietary injuries causing foul-smelling stools, undigested milk, food aversion, or vomiting, it is advisable to use a mild purgative. </p>
<p>Master Sun discussed that children with excess internal and external energy might experience slight fright during sleep or mild symptoms of wind or dietary injury, as well as a concern for heat in the body. For such cases, using Ziyuan or Longdan Decoction is appropriate. These two medicines can treat a wide range of ailments. Although they may slightly purge to reduce excess energy, they do not deplete the body’s strength. </p>
<p>If a child&#39;s stools are yellow and foul, it indicates hidden heat in the abdomen, and Longdan Decoction should be administered. If the stools are white and sour-smelling, it indicates lingering cold and indigestion, and Ziyuan should be given. Administer in small doses to help with internal digestion, and if symptoms are severe, slightly increase the dosage to facilitate mild loose stools. It is essential to limit breastfeeding for a day or two to regulate stomach energy. If not restricted, the illness may easily recur, leading to repeated purging, which could harm the stomach&#39;s energy and cause abdominal bloating. If purging occurs multiple times, it would lead to excessive depletion.</p>
<p>After the beginning of summer, if a child has a feverish illness, be cautious not to recklessly induce vomiting or purging. Instead, use heat-clearing decoctions for bathing, apply heat-clearing powders, or use red friction ointments.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>When a child has all their skin and face turning yellow, this is called jaundice. It results from excessive rest or overindulgence in food, causing heat in the spleen and stomach, which conflicts with the air from grains, leading to evaporation outward. The spleen and stomach resemble earth, and their color is yellow, affecting the muscles and thus causing the illness. Care must be taken not to moxibust, as that would worsen the heat. If there is body pain, stiffness in the back, difficulty in urination and defecation, abdominal distension, the whole body is yellow, and the eyes and nails are also yellow, with urine like the color of dust, this is jaundice. If there is thirst, difficulty in urination, abdominal fullness, and a deep, fine pulse, it is difficult to treat. The yellow illness is slightly lighter, while jaundice is extremely severe. There is also jaundice that presents as deep yellow in the lower body; this is fetal jaundice due to the mother’s organ heat affecting the fetus. As the classics state, all jaundice that turns a deep yellow is similar. If the body is slightly yellow, it indicates stomach heat. If only the face is yellow and the abdomen is distended, accompanied by a desire to eat dirt, this indicates spleen deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Thirst</strong></p>
<p>When a child is thirsty and drinks water, it is because there is heat within the organs. Heat leads to dryness in the organs, causing the body to feel hot and thirsty, thus prompting a loss of fluids that creates a desire for water to relieve it. There are also symptoms of deficiency thirst, thirst due to vomiting and diarrhea, and thirst due to cholera; each has its specific causes and conditions. Yan Xiaozhong states: For all children&#39;s thirst, caused by the loss of fluids, make them drink by giving them a decoction of Qian&#39;s white atractylodes powder freely, and the more they drink, the better.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Chai Hu San</strong>: This formula is used to treat children with typhoid fever who have no sweating and exhibit exterior symptoms, such as strong fever, headaches, body aches, dry mouth, thirst, reddish urine, constipation, and swollen cheeks with tremors. The ingredients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gypsum</li>
<li>Huang Qin (Scutellaria)</li>
<li>Licorice</li>
<li>Chi Shao (Red Peony)</li>
<li>Ge Gen (Kudzu)<br>Each ingredient is 2.5 qian (a Chinese weight unit).</li>
<li>Ma Huang (Ephedra) without stems: 5 liang</li>
<li>Chai Hu (Bupleurum): ½ liang</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind and mix these together. For a child of three years old, use 2 qian of the mixture, one small cup of water, a small amount of fresh ginger, three inches of green onion, and a pinch of fermented soybean, boil down to six parts, and administer warm.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Chen Tang</strong>: This formula treats fevers with sweating in Yangming disease. It indicates that heat cannot properly manifest as sweat. If there is sweat on the head but none on the body, dryness in the mouth, difficulty urinating, and a need for drinking water, this indicates residual heat inside, leading to possible jaundice. In cases of typhoid fever lasting seven to eight days, if the skin turns orange-yellow, with difficulty urinating and mild abdominal fullness, the herbs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh Yin Chen: 1 liang</li>
<li>Da Huang (Rhubarb): 3.5 qian</li>
<li>Zhi Zi (Gardenia): 3 large pieces</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind and mix these, using one large bowl of water. First, boil the Yin Chen and reduce it by half; then boil the other two ingredients for eight parts, strain, and take warm. This should be taken three times a day. Urination should improve, resembling the juice of soapwort, with a proper reddish color. This will help reduce body yellowing overnight, with the yellow being expelled through urination.

This condition often presents with a tight, swollen abdomen; if heat is extreme, it may lead to prolonged accumulation of phlegm and sudden onset from external wind.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zishuang Pill is used to treat food accumulation and is also a remedy for typhoid fever. It addresses issues such as irregularities in breastfeeding, stagnation leading to indigestion, bloating and fullness in the stomach and abdomen, nausea and vomiting, irregular bowel movements, and reduced milk and food intake. Additionally, it treats typhoid fever with excessive heat, stools with a sour odor, and indigestion; it is suitable for cases where sweating has occurred but body heat does not subside; for persistent heat and steaming that doesn&#39;t resolve for days; or for convulsions triggered by food, with a pattern of cold followed by heat.</p>
<p>To prepare it, use one tael of calcined realgar and vinegar steeped seven times, one tael of red ochre, fifty apricot kernels (peeled, roasted), and thirty cowbane seeds (peeled and roasted in oil). First, grind the apricot kernels and cowbane seeds in a mortar until it becomes a paste, then mix in the powdered realgar and red ochre. Form the mixture into small pills, about the size of a grain of millet. For a one-year-old, five pills can be taken with rice water; for an infant one to two hundred days old, three pills are appropriate. Dosages should be adjusted based on the child&#39;s body condition, with a mild purging effect as a standard. Generally, this remedy can be treated similarly to typhoid fever, as it addresses both conditions. It is primarily a purgative for food accumulation, with dosage adjusted according to the patient’s condition.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

<p>Combine all, with a slice of ginger and water in a bowl. Boil and take the decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Additions and Subtractions to Xiehuang Powder</strong>: This medicine drains the spleen soil, restores kidney water, and reduces heart fire.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 fen each of Huanglian (Coptis) and Yincheng (Artemisia)</li>
<li>3 fen each of Huangbai (phellodendron), Huangqin (Scutellaria), Shan Zhi (gardenia), and Poria</li>

<p>All ingredients should be crushed and made into a single dose. Boil with one cup of water until reduced to 6 parts, strain and take warm after meals. Reduce the dosage by half after the first administration, and take again in five days for recovery. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;The soil’s master is treated with bitterness.&quot; It also states: &quot;The spleen suffers from dampness; bitter foods must be consumed to dry it.&quot; Thus, Huanglian and Yincheng, with their bitter cold properties, are used to clear damp heat as the chief ingredients. The kidney needs to be firm; thus, bitter foods should be consumed to strengthen it, hence Huangbai’s bitter and cold character reinforces the muscles and bones as the minister ingredient. Damp heat creates agitation, thus it must be relieved with bitterness, which is why Huangqin and Shan Zhi, being bitter and cold, are used to calm restlessness and fullness as assistants. Internal dampness is addressed with mild diuretics, hence Poria and Zexie’s sweet, mild properties encourage urination to guide out dampness as the envoy.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Qian&#39;s Direct Guidelines&quot; states: A five-year-old named Zhu suddenly developed a fever. The physician said: This is heat in the heart. His cheeks were red and his lips were red, and he was irritable and thirsty. Consequently, three doses of niuhuang pills were used, followed by a purging heart decoction. The next day, he did not improve, but instead appeared weak and could not eat; after further purging, he passed yellow foam. Qian remarked: The heart is deficient, and there is retained heat within, caused by the cold medicine, which has resulted in this condition of deficiency and wasting illness. It is better first to use baizhu powder, which promotes the body&#39;s fluid in the stomach. When asked how the yellow foam is produced, he responded: When the stomach&#39;s qi is right, it will naturally stop purging; this is deficiency heat. Zhu asked: What about the use of the purging heart decoction? Qian replied: The purging heart decoction contains only a bit of huanglian. Huanglian is cold in nature; prolonged use will cause purging and can chill the spleen and stomach. After sitting for a long time, many physicians arrived, all asserting heat is present. Qian insisted it was deficiency heat. If it were real heat, why would the purging heart decoction not settle it? In addition, with a yellow face and red cheeks, anxiety in the five hearts, and not eating but feeling thirsty. The physician inquired: Since it is deficiency heat, why is the stool yellow foam? Qian laughed and said: The yellow foam stool is due to taking the purging heart decoction. Qian treated him with Hu huanglian pills and cured him.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

His son suddenly developed a fever; the father self-prescribed three doses of Qingjin ointment and administered one dose as a pill. After taking them, at around midnight, the son experienced diarrhea five times and became drowsy. The father remarked that the son was excessively sleepy and gave him another dose of Qingjin ointment, resulting in three more episodes of diarrhea, accompanied by dryness in the mouth and feverishness of the body. The father noted there was still a slight remaining heat, so he administered more Qingjin ointment. The mother said, &quot;Using medicine more than ten times hasn&#39;t helped; what if he develops another illness?&quot; They called in Dr. Qian, who stated, &quot;He has become thin and weak.&quot; Initially, he used Baizhu powder, taken at intervals, then after thirteen days, he prescribed Xiangji pills, and the son recovered.</p>
<p>Zhu&#39;s five-year-old child developed a fever at night and returned to normal in the morning. Various doctors attempted to treat it as typhoid or as a heat illness, prescribing cooling medicines, but it did not improve. The child exhibited excessive salivation and was very sleepy. Other doctors tried giving iron powder pills to alleviate the salivation, which worsened the condition. After five days, they insisted on giving him a large drink. Dr. Qian said, &quot;It should not be purged.&quot; He then took one tael of Baizhu powder, boiled it down to three sheng of medicinal broth, allowing the child to take as much as he wished. Zhu asked, &quot;Won&#39;t drinking too much cause diarrhea?&quot; Dr. Qian replied, &quot;Water alone won&#39;t cause diarrhea, even if he drinks a lot, it&#39;s not surprising, but it should not be purged.&quot; Zhu asked, &quot;What was the initial illness?&quot; Dr. Qian explained, &quot;It stops diarrhea, treats phlegm, and clears heat to calm the spirit; all of this is due to this medicine.&quot; By evening, the medicine was fully consumed. Dr. Qian checked and said, &quot;He can still take three sheng.&quot; They boiled another three sheng of Baizhu powder, and upon consuming all of it, he began to improve slightly. On the third day, they again administered three sheng of Baizhu powder, and the child no longer felt thirsty or had excessive salivation. They also gave two doses of Wujiao powder, leading to his stability.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

Some used two pills of ox bile and musk, but there was no improvement; when the thirst-quenching dry kudzu powder was used, he vomited in return. The teacher said that food was lodged in the stomach, so first, a white biscuit was given to remedy it, then the digestion pills were ground and administered, and he was cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: In Caizhai, a household had a young boy of fifteen years old who had been ill with jaundice for a year, his face was yellow like gold, his body was swollen and weak, and he only consumed salt and burnt food. The Dai people used tea to adjust a powder which caused him to vomit a bowl of saliva. By evening, he was given seventy to eighty pills of Zhuoche combined with three qian of Tongjing powder, and four to five doses were taken. After six to seven days, he was administered Zhuoche pills and Jun Chuan powder, again taking four to five doses. He developed a dislike for salt and burnt food, and his complexion turned red. Later, more tea was used to adjust the powder and he expelled two liters of phlegm before fully recovering.</p>
<p>According to Wan’s &quot;Youke Huafen,&quot; a child developed a fever, particularly worsening in the evening. His doctor treated for malaria but it was ineffective, and then attempted treatment for tidal fever, which also failed. I said: this is a case of weak stomach with retained food. If it were malaria, there would be chills and fevers that start and stop; if it were tidal fever, the onset would occur at specific times like the tides, rising and then receding, only to return the next day at the same time. This child&#39;s body was usually warm, but became quite severe during the evening hours. Hence, it&#39;s understood this is a case of retained food causing a fever. He asked: is there a basis for this? I replied: refer to the theory of Zhang Zhongjing where it discusses the Yangming disease in the case of a febrile illness: tidal fever indicates an excess, which should be purged.

I diagnosed this as heat in the heart and spleen, and treated it with two formulas, Dao Chi and Xie Huang, leading to recovery. However, it recurred, and I resorted to other treatments, administering cooling and phlegm-transforming medicines, but the previous symptoms worsened, along with tongue manipulation. I used Yi Gong San with additional Jiaoteng and achieved stability; I then used Liu Jun Zi Decoction for recovery. The protruding tongue indicates heat in the spleen channel; tongue manipulation suggests deficiency-heat in the spleen, causing the tongue to extend and retract. Practitioners should be discerning in their approach!</p>
<p>Another child had a fever, poor appetite, and unformed stools, often taking aloe preparations. Observing a red nose indicated that the cold remedies were harming the spleen’s earth element, resulting in deficient heat. I prescribed several doses of Wu Wei Yi Gong San to restore the vital energy.</p>
<p>A different child experienced difficulty urinating, had a dry nose with nosebleeds, and a red hue between the nostrils, indicating heat in the spleen and lungs. I used Ji Sheng Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction, and the previous symptoms improved. However, the skin between the chin remained red, with thirst and phlegm, suggesting insufficient kidney qi. I prescribed Di Huang Wan, and all symptoms resolved.</p>
<p>Another child had a fever and cough with a red hue on the right cheek; this indicated heat in the lung metal. I treated with Xie Bai San, which resulted in recovery. Subsequently, the child caught a cold and the previous symptoms returned, further complicated by heaviness of voice and nasal discharge. I treated this with Shen Su Decoction, adding apricot kernels and mulberry bark for recovery. However, the right cheek remained red, along with slight redness on the forehead, indicating that heart fire was affecting lung metal.

This shows the stomach is weak and unable to nourish the lung. I first prescribed a dose of the Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with a bit of Bupleurum, and after taking it he did not vomit; then I used two doses of Atractylodes Powder, and he was no longer thirsty; finally, I gave him four more doses of the Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction, and he became stable.</p>
<p>Another child had tidal fever and great thirst, with hard and dry stools, shortness of breath, and coughing, along with redness in the right cheek. This indicated heat in both the lung and large intestine. I prescribed a dose of Chaihu Decoction, and all symptoms receded immediately. Later, due to slight fright, he had convulsions, gritted teeth, and was restless; this indicated deficiency of liver and spleen qi and blood, which I treated with the Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction plus Ligusticum, Angelica, and Uncaria, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child presented with tidal fever and restlessness, with a bluish-red left cheek; this indicated deficiency of heart and liver blood. I used the Secret Formula to Calm the Spirit Pill and the Four Substance Decoction with added Fangfeng and Suanzaoren to treat it, which soon led to recovery; I further prescribed Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill to nourish the liver and kidneys, and he healed.</p>
<p>In the book &quot;Essentials for Safeguarding Infants,&quot; it says: A child presented first with robust heat and constipation, who upon taking cooling drinks recovered, but then symptoms recurred; he took Dihuang Pi Powder but still had tidal fever; taking the Four Substance Decoction with Scutellaria at inappropriate times led to intensified heat. I remarked: If the heat is inappropriate, it may appear during the day and disappear at night, or vice versa, indicating empty heat, and one should nourish the source of transformation. If one does not believe and continues to take cold medicine, it will worsen. In the evening, I used Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, and in the morning I applied the Middle-Boosting Qi Tonic with added Dioscorea and Cornelian cherry, leading to a cure.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another child had a fever and thirst. I prescribed Xie Huang San, which caused heavy and drooping stool, excessive salivation from the corners of the mouth, and still the desire to purge heat. I said: the nasal tip is pale blue, which indicates spleen deficiency being attacked by liver wood; the excessive salivation from the mouth indicates failure of stomach qi to govern salivation; heavy stool indicates that the spleen qi cannot ascend. Not believing this, additional cooling medicine was given, and indeed, the eyebrows and lips slightly moved, and all four limbs mildly convulsed. I remarked: this is severe deficiency of original qi leading to slow spleen wind. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang with roasted ginger, Angelica, Mu Xiang, and two doses of Diaoteng Gou, which greatly benefited him. He requested more doses.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child experienced a fever during the Yin and Mao hours, accompanied by convulsions and phlegm. After taking the Bao Long Xie Qing Er Wan, the child recovered. Later, the same symptoms returned, along with coughing and wheezing, intermittent convulsions, and a flushed or cyanotic face, sometimes with swelling and excessive salivation. I diagnosed the coughing and wheezing as due to deficiency of spleen and lung qi; the intermittent convulsions as liver wood overpowering the spleen; the cyanotic and yellow complexion as liver invading the heart and spleen; and the swelling and salivation as spleen qi deficiency. I used Yi Zhi Wan to nourish the heart&#39;s blood and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to tonify the spleen qi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child experienced fever and palpitations during the Si and Wu hours, appearing fatigued and having a yellow complexion with poor appetite and excessive salivation when drinking soup. I attributed this to insufficient heart qi. When the child did not believe me and instead took cooling heart medicine, the condition worsened with vomiting and diarrhea, and they showed signs of slow onset spleen wind. I initially used Liu Jun Jiang Gui Tang, assisted with Di Huang Wan, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>A third child had a fever and a flushed face during the Shen and You hours, along with abdominal pain. When a harsh medicine was used, it led to convulsions and vomiting of phlegm, with thirst and abdominal pain exacerbated by pressure. This indicated damage to the spleen and stomach resulting in a change in symptoms. I applied Qi Wei Bai Zhu San and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to stability.</p>
<p>A fourth child had a fever during the Hai and Zi hours, appeared fatigued, had a yellow complexion with poor appetite and excessive salivation when drinking soup, and was treated with Yi Huang San, leading to recovery. The illness later recurred despite taking the previous medicine and cooling agents. The child&#39;s state involved frequent illness, excessive sleeping with eyes exposed, thirst, reduced appetite, and frequent yellow stools. This was due to spleen deficiency with liver wood prevailing, in addition to sinking of the original qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child was restless and anxious, suffering from heat and thirst, drinking cold water, and showing a red hue on the forehead. This indicated internal heat of the heart. First, I administered a dose of Xie Xin Tang to alleviate the condition slightly, followed by Chai Hu Zhi Zi San, which brought recovery.</p>
<p>In the year of Jia Jing, during the Jia Yin year, the daughter of a loyal official, aged twelve, suffered from inherent weakness of the spleen and stomach. From summer to autumn, she experienced intermittent diarrhea and slight abdominal pain. By August and September, she developed symptoms of accumulation and heat, with a continuous fever lasting over twenty days. She sweated out the heat, but the fever persisted. The abdomen from the center to the lower area was swollen and hard, with loose stools, wheezing, coughing, and belching, all worsening at night and accompanied by restlessness, nasal congestion, darkening of the eyes, and incoherent speech, leading her family to believe she would surely die. Upon examination, I noted the pulse was large and floating with no root, which indicated severe deficiency. I deemed it necessary to prescribe Shen Tang. </p>
<p>I used one liang of ginseng, three fen of roasted aconite, and three slices of fresh ginger, taken twice a day. This resulted in a significant discharge of the accumulated heat, causing a fishy odor, the abdomen gradually relaxed, and the heat decreased. The pulse began to strengthen but hands continued to tremble, and there was nosebleed. I stated it was a liver condition and prescribed Liu Wei Wan. After one dose, she seemed to have recovered. During the day, she took only the ginseng and ginger soup, and at night, the Liu Wei Wan, her pulse gradually regained strength, and the symptoms lessened.</p>
<p>Before this, her hands and feet were always hot; now she began to feel cold. I was glad to see that the evil was completely expelled and the true qi was apparent. However, she still had no appetite, so I used only Liu Jun Zi Tang with added roasted ginger, enabling her to eat. The cough was particularly severe, so I administered Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which stopped the cough, and she finally slept well and recovered completely at night.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the &quot;Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot;: Luo Qianfu treated a young child whose body was steaming from summer heat, with a full and troubled chest, skin colored like orange peel, and yellowing of the white of the eyes. The child exhibited weak muscles and bones, unable to stand or walk. This condition arose from the summer heat, compounded by humidity, which steamed and obstructed the meridians and penetrated the bone marrow, causing the organ energies to falter. Thus, the spleen seized control over the heart, leading to the combination of damp heat that resulted in this illness. Indeed, when heart fire is excessive, the body steams with heat, the chest is filled with distress, and when spleen dampness prevails, the skin takes on an orange hue. Excess energy must thereby suppress its own weakness; this indicates that the kidneys and liver have been invaded by evil, resulting in weakened muscles and bones, unable to support standing or walking. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that heat in the spleen results in a yellow color and a glutinous texture of the flesh, and it further mentions damp heat leading to atrophy; these words are truly credible! What is said about the son being nourished by the real mother implies that by nourishing the child, one must reduce its condition. Hence, when the spleen’s earth is diminished from its original position, the kidney&#39;s water can return, and the heart&#39;s fire will naturally decrease. Furthermore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; indicates that the treatment for atrophy specifically focuses on the Yangming channel, and this precisely refers to that principle. A modified version of the Xiaohuang San should be used to address this condition.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: My second son was born in the year of Yimao, in the fifth month. In early autumn of that year, he suddenly caught a chill and developed a fever, with a weak and tight pulse. However, knowing that his internal organs were prone to cold, I dared not dispel it directly. So I combined herbs such as Chuanxiong, Suye, Qianghuo, Zhizi, Xixin, and fresh ginger, hoping to dispel his cold. After one dose, not only did his fever not subside, but he developed severe diarrhea instead, which did not stop for two consecutive days and was followed by wheezing; the more he diarrheaed, the more he wheezed. At this moment, I wondered if the cold was too strong. Why did warming herbs lead to diarrhea? Could it be that fire was attacking metal? How could days of clearing and purging still be vulnerable to cold and damp? Was it likely that the exterior pathogen remained? If that were the case, why was there no relief when I attempted to disperse it? At a loss, my anxiety grew. I could see his internal condition was severe; he was wheezing and in danger. How could a simple remedy bring him back? After deep contemplation, I gradually understood some things. I decided to use two qian of ginseng and five slices of fresh ginger, decocted into half a cup of liquid, yet I did not dare to administer it hastily, fearing it would worsen the wheezing and lead to a situation beyond remedy.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Using a tea spoon, I administered two or three doses, then watched closely as the breaths entered and exited. Although the wheezing had not lessened, it also did not increase significantly, so I administered three or four more doses. After a little while, I noticed that the breathing seemed to ease somewhat, so I boldly gave half a small cup, and then there was a noticeable response. From noon until dusk, I completed this one dose. Just then, a physician arrived in haste, calling out: &quot;Mistake! Mistake! How can someone with such severe wheezing still take ginseng? Quickly use Baolong pills to resolve this.&quot; I agreed but did not heed his advice, and instead, administered two and a half drachms of ginseng, brewing a decoction as before. From dusk until midnight, I completed the dosage. When the medication was finished, the breathing became steady, and he fell into a deep sleep; the cough ceased, and the fever retreated. This teaches us that the wheezing was a result of the diarrheal reaction, indicating a deficiency in the middle. If there were real pathogenic factors, the wheezing would diminish as the diarrhea lessened, which is distinguishable. Had I mistakenly heeded the physician&#39;s advice and switched to cleansing agents, it would have depleted the middle qi, leading to certain danger, and I would have been blamed for wrongly using ginseng. Who is right and who is wrong? How to discern? I record this to demonstrate the efficacy of warming the interior and dispersing cold, showcasing its subtlety.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

When one is harmed by cold, they borrow the yang energy to transform the heat; although the heat is intense, it does not lead to death. Yet, the yang energy arises from the essence of water; for boys, this begins at eight years old, and for girls, seven years old, when the kidney energy starts to be substantial. Infants have not reached the stage of menses, and their kidney energy is not strong, hence the Emperor poses this question. The heart governs the pulse and depends on the kidneys for vitality. The energies of water and fire circulate between the heart and the kidneys; when kidney energy cannot support the heart, the heart feels as if it is starving, and the pulse at the wrist becomes faint and weak, indicating the kidney energy is still insufficient.] Qi Bo said: If the hands and feet are warm, one thrives; if they are cold, one perishes."},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"【Note: The vitality of a newborn is attributed to the post-natal energy.

The kidneys are the water organ, absorbing the essences of the five organs and storing them, being the essence from pre-natal sources, which is also supplemented by post-natal resources. Furthermore, it differentiates and produces two pathways of nourishment and defense. The great energy that stagnates and does not circulate is called ancestral energy, accumulating in the chest, rising to the lungs to assist with respiration, being the source of vitality for the limbs. Therefore, if the extremities are warm, it indicates life; if cold, it indicates death.】 The Emperor asked: \"What is the pulse like for an infant with wind-heat, wheezing, and shoulder breathing?\" Qibo replied: \"For wheezing and shoulder breathing, the pulse is full and strong. A relaxed pulse indicates life, while a rapid pulse indicates death.\" 【Note: This again discusses the importance of the ancestral energy generated after birth, which should not be harmed. Ancestral energy is foundational to the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians, hence its name. Shoulder breathing refers to breathing that causes the shoulders to rise. The pathogenic wind-heat initially harms the skin and hair; wheezing and shoulder breathing occur when wind-heat is strong and internally harms the lung energy and ancestral energy, hence the pulse is full and strong.

Excessive food intake can cause internal heat manifesting on the surface, thus treating the internal condition to clear the bright yang heat will help resolve surface heat without mistaking it as an external pathogen; using heavy purging medications like Xiao Chai Hu might harm the internal state instead. If tidal fever is prolonged, it might indicate the onset of smallpox, so careful examination is necessary before using medications.

The formula Shen Ling Bai Zhu San should be used for this purpose. In cases of children with heat syndrome, after using both exterior and interior medications, if the heat completely subsides and then reappears, what is the reason?

Alternatively, it may stem from weakness of the spleen and stomach, with internal causes attacking and giving rise to symptoms such as yellow skin, protruding belly with blue veins, muscle wasting, lack of external color, and a必黃色a complexion, which relates to wasting disease. Treatment: If the jaundice is caused by damp heat, it resembles smoke-induced color; one should use Wuling Powder with Mahuang, boiled with fresh ginger and taken as a decoction, which will induce sweating and lead to recovery.

The classics say: \"The central yellow corresponds to the spleen.\" Therefore, jaundice is the color of the spleen. The spirit of a person is more precious when it is contained and quietly utilized; when it is seen externally, it indicates internal deficiency. This is all due to a deficiency of spleen qi, where transformation and transportation fail, causing dampness and heat to linger in the skin, resulting in jaundice. As Qian Zhongyang stated, symptoms like body aches, back weakness, and yellowing of the skin, face, and nails indicate this condition, with brownish urine being difficult to treat. The treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen first; if one relies solely on harsh purgatives and diuretics, it is rarely safe.

If the child exhibits body heat with anxiety over drinking water, trembling hands and feet, looking upwards while moving the tongue, visible blue veins on the inner hands, red palms, and fear of objects causing salivation, this is deemed startling heat. If a child has body heat with a red face that does not subside over time, disturbed sleep with cries, rapid breathing and thirst, elevated chest with phlegm stagnation, this represents accumulated heat. It resembles strong heat but is distinct due to the phlegm accumulation in the elevated chest, indicating a build-up of heat and toxins in the organs, causing stagnation in the three burners. Also, if the child shakes their head and has a stiff neck, it too indicates stagnation in the three burners.

If a child has a fever that comes and goes, with a hot belly during the fever; or if they have a nighttime fever with a yellow face, abdominal bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, and food not digesting well, with a sour and foul-smelling stool, this indicates food injury, treated according to the protocols for food injury. When a child has a nighttime fever that resolves by morning, excessive salivation, and seems to enjoy sleeping, this suggests that the child has a deficiency of the lungs causing the fever, which can resemble a food injury. It is crucial to differentiate between the two, as the residual symptoms vary: in food injury, one can use purgatives; in lung deficiency, one should not, as doing so will lose vital fluids, causing thirst and a desire for drinks. In the past, Qian Yi treated a five-year-old who had a nighttime fever that resolved by morning.

Zhu asked: \"If he drinks too much, won’t it cause diarrhea?\" Yi replied: \"With no living water, it cannot cause diarrhea. Even if there is a discharge, it is not alarming; just don’t use a laxative!\" Zhu further inquired: \"What illness was treated first?\" Yi responded: \"To stop diarrhea, treat phlegm, reduce fever, and calm the spirit—all with this medicine.\" After the prescription was fully taken, it was given again twice, and the child was no longer thirsty and had no phlegm. Then, two doses of Ejiao powder were given, and he was at peace. This is indicative of that condition. This is recorded in the collected works of Qian Yi. For children with fever, emaciation, and excessive thirst, whose diet does not lead to muscle growth, it indicates intestinal heat, which should be treated by addressing the intestinal issue.

Fever in children may derive from both internal and external causes. Internal causes often arise from excessive water consumption, while external causes are typically due to wind and cold. According to Qian, when a child has an internal fever and drinks a lot of water, it indicates internal heat, while if a child has a fever and does not drink water, it indicates external heat. This is a general diagnostic principle. For internal causes, treatment should focus on purging, while for external causes, treatment should focus on dispersing. Yan Xiaozhong discusses the patterns of high fever from wind chill and illnesses like warm epidemic and cold damage, as well as wind-heat measles and food injury, which are all quite similar and often difficult to distinguish.

For such cases, using Ziyuan or Longdan Decoction is appropriate. These two medicines can treat a wide range of ailments. Although they may slightly purge to reduce excess energy, they do not deplete the body’s strength. If a child's stools are yellow and foul, it indicates hidden heat in the abdomen, and Longdan Decoction should be administered. If the stools are white and sour-smelling, it indicates lingering cold and indigestion, and Ziyuan should be given. Administer in small doses to help with internal digestion, and if symptoms are severe, slightly increase the dosage to facilitate mild loose stools. It is essential to limit breastfeeding for a day or two to regulate stomach energy. If not restricted, the illness may easily recur, leading to repeated purging, which could harm the stomach's energy and cause abdominal bloating. If purging occurs multiple times, it would lead to excessive depletion. After the beginning of summer, if a child has a feverish illness, be cautious not to recklessly induce vomiting or purging.

If there is body pain, stiffness in the back, difficulty in urination and defecation, abdominal distension, the whole body is yellow, and the eyes and nails are also yellow, with urine like the color of dust, this is jaundice. If there is thirst, difficulty in urination, abdominal fullness, and a deep, fine pulse, it is difficult to treat. The yellow illness is slightly lighter, while jaundice is extremely severe.

Another child craved rich foods and sweet flavors, experienced fever and thirst, and had cloudy urine. The treatment included Si Wei Fei Er Wan and was supplemented with Xie Huang San, leading to slight improvements. Afterward, the child suffered from food damage, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea, which required the use of Xiao Shi Wan. With a compromised stomach Qi and reduced appetite, causing fatigue and thirst, first Qi Wei Bai Zhu San was administered to stop the thirst, followed by Wu Wei Yi Gong San, leading to complete recovery. Lastly, a child with a pale complexion suffered from thirst, productive cough, and fever. Treatments with heat-clearing and phlegm-resolving medicine led to diarrhea and frequent urination, indicating the injury of the spleen and kidneys. In the morning, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was used, and in the evening, Si Shen Wan, resulting in gradual recovery.

This indicated internal heat of the heart. First, I administered a dose of Xie Xin Tang to alleviate the condition slightly, followed by Chai Hu Zhi Zi San, which brought recovery. In the year of Jia Jing, during the Jia Yin year, the daughter of a loyal official, aged twelve, suffered from inherent weakness of the spleen and stomach. From summer to autumn, she experienced intermittent diarrhea and slight abdominal pain. By August and September, she developed symptoms of accumulation and heat, with a continuous fever lasting over twenty days. She sweated out the heat, but the fever persisted. The abdomen from the center to the lower area was swollen and hard, with loose stools, wheezing, coughing, and belching, all worsening at night and accompanied by restlessness, nasal congestion, darkening of the eyes, and incoherent speech, leading her family to believe she would surely die. Upon examination, I noted the pulse was large and floating with no root, which indicated severe deficiency. I deemed it necessary to prescribe Shen Tang. I used one liang of ginseng, three fen of roasted aconite, and three slices of fresh ginger, taken twice a day. This resulted in a significant discharge of the accumulated heat, causing a fishy odor, the abdomen gradually relaxed, and the heat decreased. The pulse began to strengthen but hands continued to tremble, and there was nosebleed. I stated it was a liver condition and prescribed Liu Wei Wan. After one dose, she seemed to have recovered. During the day, she took only the ginseng and ginger soup, and at night, the Liu Wei Wan, her pulse gradually regained strength, and the symptoms lessened. Before this, her hands and feet were always hot; now she began to feel cold. I was glad to see that the evil was completely expelled and the true qi was apparent. However, she still had no appetite, so I used only Liu Jun Zi Tang with added roasted ginger, enabling her to eat. The cough was particularly severe, so I administered Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which stopped the cough, and she finally slept well and recovered completely at night."},{"anchor":"trans-147p","marker":"147p","type":"translation","text":"According to the \"Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment\": Luo Qianfu treated a young child whose body was steaming from summer heat, with a full and troubled chest, skin colored like orange peel, and yellowing of the white of the eyes. The child exhibited weak muscles and bones, unable to stand or walk. This condition arose from the summer heat, compounded by humidity, which steamed and obstructed the meridians and penetrated the bone marrow, causing the organ energies to falter. Thus, the spleen seized control over the heart, leading to the combination of damp heat that resulted in this illness. Indeed, when heart fire is excessive, the body steams with heat, the chest is filled with distress, and when spleen dampness prevails, the skin takes on an orange hue. Excess energy must thereby suppress its own weakness; this indicates that the kidneys and liver have been invaded by evil, resulting in weakened muscles and bones, unable to support standing or walking. The \"Inner Canon\" states that heat in the spleen results in a yellow color and a glutinous texture of the flesh, and it further mentions damp heat leading to atrophy; these words are truly credible! What is said about the son being nourished by the real mother implies that by nourishing the child, one must reduce its condition. Hence, when the spleen’s earth is diminished from its original position, the kidney's water can return, and the heart's fire will naturally decrease. Furthermore, the \"Inner Canon\" indicates that the treatment for atrophy specifically focuses on the Yangming channel, and this precisely refers to that principle. A modified version of the Xiaohuang San should be used to address this condition."},{"anchor":"trans-148p","marker":"148p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Complete Book of Jingyue\" states: My second son was born in the year of Yimao, in the fifth month. In early autumn of that year, he suddenly caught a chill and developed a fever, with a weak and tight pulse. However, knowing that his internal organs were prone to cold, I dared not dispel it directly. So I combined herbs such as Chuanxiong, Suye, Qianghuo, Zhizi, Xixin, and fresh ginger, hoping to dispel his cold. After one dose, not only did his fever not subside, but he developed severe diarrhea instead, which did not stop for two consecutive days and was followed by wheezing; the more he diarrheaed, the more he wheezed. At this moment, I wondered if the cold was too strong. Why did warming herbs lead to diarrhea? Could it be that fire was attacking metal? How could days of clearing and purging still be vulnerable to cold and damp? Was it likely that the exterior pathogen remained? If that were the case, why was there no relief when I attempted to disperse it? At a loss, my anxiety grew. I could see his internal condition was severe; he was wheezing and in danger. How could a simple remedy bring him back? After deep contemplation, I gradually understood some things. I decided to use two qian of ginseng and five slices of fresh ginger, decocted into half a cup of liquid, yet I did not dare to administer it hastily, fearing it would worsen the wheezing and lead to a situation beyond remedy."},{"anchor":"trans-149p","marker":"149p","type":"translation","text":"Using a tea spoon, I administered two or three doses, then watched closely as the breaths entered and exited. Although the wheezing had not lessened, it also did not increase significantly, so I administered three or four more doses. After a little while, I noticed that the breathing seemed to ease somewhat, so I boldly gave half a small cup, and then there was a noticeable response. From noon until dusk, I completed this one dose. Just then, a physician arrived in haste, calling out: \"Mistake! Mistake! How can someone with such severe wheezing still take ginseng? Quickly use Baolong pills to resolve this.\" I agreed but did not heed his advice, and instead, administered two and a half drachms of ginseng, brewing a decoction as before. From dusk until midnight, I completed the dosage. When the medication was finished, the breathing became steady, and he fell into a deep sleep; the cough ceased, and the fever retreated. This teaches us that the wheezing was a result of the diarrheal reaction, indicating a deficiency in the middle. If there were real pathogenic factors, the wheezing would diminish as the diarrhea lessened, which is distinguishable. Had I mistakenly heeded the physician's advice and switched to cleansing agents, it would have depleted the middle qi, leading to certain danger, and I would have been blamed for wrongly using ginseng. Who is right and who is wrong? How to discern? I record this to demonstrate the efficacy of warming the interior and dispersing cold, showcasing its subtlety."},{"anchor":"orig-1p","marker":"1p","type":"original","text":"古今图书集成医部全录卷四百十九 小儿诸热门 黄帝素问
