</code></pre>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Six Essentials and Proper Records</strong></p>
<p>When the fire is intense, and the people suffer greatly, they become anxious and distressed, often resulting in sudden death.<br>(Note: This indicates that excessive heat injures the essence and blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty, by Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In the chapter on jaundice, it is said: When one experiences internal distress and heat in the heart, is unable to eat, and has intermittent urges to vomit, this is termed &quot;alcoholic jaundice.&quot; For alcoholic jaundice, when there is internal distress, sometimes with heat and pain, the main remedy is Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</strong> (Han Dynasty, by Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For Taiyang disease, the pulse is floating and rapid. A floating pulse indicates wind, rapid signifies heat, and movement suggests pain; rapid also indicates deficiency. If there is headache and fever with slight night sweats and a reversal of chills, the exterior has not yet resolved. If a physician wrongly purges it, the rapid pulse will transform to a slow one, and there will be opposing pain in the chest, emptiness in the stomach, external pathogenic qi moving the diaphragm, shortness of breath, restlessness, and internal distress of the heart. If the yang qi sinks within and the heart feels hardened, it results in &quot;heart knot.&quot; The main remedy for this is Da Xian Xiong Decoction. If there is no heart knot but sweating from the head and no sweating in other areas, with stiff neck and difficulty in urination, the body will definitely turn yellow.</p>
<p>For Yangming disease, the pulse is floating and tight, with a dry throat and bitter mouth, fullness in the abdomen and dyspnea, fever with sweating, but no aversion to cold, rather an aversion to heat, and heaviness in the body. If sweating occurs, it leads to restlessness, with the heart feeling disturbed, and the possibility of delirium; if further needling is applied, it will cause great anxiety and insomnia; if purged, the stomach will be empty, leading to the external pathogenic qi moving the diaphragm, resulting in internal distress of the heart.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>For a fetus on the tongue, use the Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction as the primary treatment. If there is thirst with a desire for water and dry mouth, use the White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng. If the pulse is floating with fever, thirst wanting water, and difficulty in urination, use the Polyporus Decoction.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, if purged, there may be vexation in the heart and dry stool in the stomach, and it can be treated aggressively; if the abdomen is slightly distended, initially hard but later becomes loose, do not treat aggressively. If there is dry stool, Da Chengqi Decoction is appropriate.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, absence of sweating, difficulty in urination, and vexation in the heart indicate that the body will likely turn yellow.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, if purged and there is exterior heat with warm hands and feet, without fullness in the chest, vexation in the heart, inability to eat due to hunger, but only sweating on the head, use the Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction as the primary treatment.</p>
<p>In cases of winding cold damage with headache, rapid fever, resembling wind stroke, often with slight sweating and spontaneous vomiting, purging may increase vexation, leading to vexation in the heart as if starving; if sweating is induced, it may lead to convulsions, and the body becomes strong and difficult to bend or stretch; mist treatment may cause yellowing, and if there is prolonged difficulty in urination, it may result in coughing and vomiting.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety is a state of agitation and heat, characterized by restlessness and discomfort; in severe cases, it can resemble the effects of toxic substances like the seeds of the Palaquium plant or the Aconitum. When one is troubled and unable to sleep due to internal heat and stagnation of qi, there may be symptoms such as chest fullness and pain, or subtle sweating with restlessness. In such instances, the Zhizi Decoction is prescribed. If the person has low qi, add one qian of licorice; if there is nausea or if they initially took pills incorrectly, add half a liang of fresh ginger. For all cases of anxiety and restlessness, the Liangge Powder is very effective. Soaking the hands and feet in water can help dispel the heat from the heart and chest.</p>
<p>For those experiencing restlessness and fullness in the abdomen, unable to sit or lie down comfortably, the Zhizi and Houpo Decoction is indicated. If symptoms arise after bowel movements in a case of Yangming disease, characterized by agitation and anxiety, the San Yi Chengqi Decoction is appropriate. If restlessness and insomnia occur after sweating, use Wuling Powder or Liangge Powder. If there is dry mouth, moaning, and incoherence leading to insomnia, Wuling Powder or Huanglian Jiedu Decoction may help. For anxiety, Liangge Powder is suitable. For cases of Shaoyang syndrome with chest fullness without nausea, the Xiao Chaihu Decoction should omit Banxia and include Ren Shen and the fruit of the Trichosanthes.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>Syndrome of Shen-Condition and Distress</h3>
<p>How can we explain the syndrome of shen-condition and distress? The term &quot;distress&quot; refers to the feeling of annoyance, while &quot;shen&quot; indicates a gloomy demeanor. It describes a state of inner annoyance and frustration, restlessness, and a feeling of gloom that makes one unable to relax, even more severe than mere annoyance. This arises when the yang pathogen invades through a deficiency and becomes trapped inside, causing stagnation in the chest. The classic text states: If the superficial condition is not resolved and the physician mistakenly purges, an empty stomach leads to internal disturbance, causing distress in the heart. It also states: Purging increases annoyance, and the heart feels distressed as if in hunger; this is due to the internal sinking of yang energy, resulting in various forms of distress.</p>
<p>The treatment methods may involve inducing vomiting or purging. If sweating, vomiting, and purging lead to restlessness and inability to sleep, or if symptoms are severe, the condition may alternate, causing distress in the heart. If treated like a Yangming disease with purging, when there is heat on the exterior, the hands and feet are warm but there is no chest fullness, and the heart feels distressed, accompanied by inability to eat yet sweating from the head, this indicates that evil heat is stagnant in the chest. In this case, one must use Zhizi Chih Tang to expel the stagnant heat.</p>
<p>For Yangming disease with purging that leads to heart distress and dryness in the stomach, if there is no sweating and urinary difficulty, causing subsequent yellowing, this indicates evil heat is consolidated in the stomach. In such cases, one must use DACHENGQI TANG or YINCHENTANG to attack and clear the internal heat. If one understands these principles, vomiting or purging will lead to recovery; with the correct modifications of decoctions, there will be no cases that do not heal. However, if one mistakenly induces sweating instead of purging to treat heat, various conditions may arise, often resulting in rashes or yellow symptoms.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction</strong> [from Zhang Jingyue, same as below] treats jaundice due to drinking, with feelings of vexation or heat pain in the heart. Ingredients: 14 pieces of gardenia, one tael of rhubarb, 5 pieces of bitter orange, and 1 sheng of fermented soybeans. Combine these four ingredients with 6 sheng of water, boil down to 2 sheng, and divide into three warm doses.</p>
<p><strong>Gardenia Decoction</strong> treats restlessness and insomnia after sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. If severe, one may turn and toss; there will be vexation in the heart. Ingredients: 14 pieces of large gardenia and 7 he of fermented soybeans. Combine these two ingredients, first boil gardenia in 4 sheng of water to get 2.5 sheng, then add fermented soybeans and boil for three more rounds. Remove the dregs and take 1 sheng each time. If feeling stable, do not take more. If belching or nausea occurs, add 2 tael of tangerine peel, and ginger can also be added in the amount of 2 tael.</p>
<p><strong>Gardenia and Magnolia Bark Decoction</strong> treats post-cold syndrome with feelings of vexation and abdominal fullness, making sitting or lying uncomfortable. Ingredients: 7 pieces of large gardenia, 2 qian of bitter orange, and half a tael of magnolia bark (peeled and roasted). Prepare by grinding into pieces the size of soybeans, boil with 1.5 cups of water, and strain to obtain half a cup of juice. Take warm.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Liangge San</strong>, also known as <strong>Lianqiao Yinzi</strong>, is used to treat febrile diseases where the exterior is not fully released and the interior is affected. Symptoms include restlessness, insomnia, and delirious speech resembling a heated condition. </p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lianqiao: 1 tael</li>
<li>Licorice: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Sanjizhi (Gardenia fruit)</li>
<li>Mint leaves</li>
<li>Rhubarb</li>
<li>Huangqin (Scutellaria): each 0.5 taels</li>
<li>Not more than 1 fen of (Shibu) nitrate</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind the above into a fine powder, take 2 qian with a cup of water and a little honey, and boil until reduced to about 70% of the original volume. Strain and take warm.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Anshen Wan</strong>, attributed to Dongyuan, treats mental agitation and anxiety, the urge to vomit, and chaotic heat in the chest, resembling a state of frustration. This is caused by upward fire from the blood, leading to restlessness. It is advisable to apply balancing methods to calm the depressive fire and nourish the primal energy in the upper jiao. </p>
<p>Classical texts state: Hot excesses are treated with cold sweet and bitter to drain them. Use the bitter cold of Huanglian (Coptis) to alleviate restlessness and clear damp heat as the main treatment; combine the sweet cold of Licorice and Raw Rehmannia to drain fire, replenish energy, and nourish yin blood as auxiliary treatments. Add Danggui to replenish insufficient blood, and Zhusha to settle floating fire and calm the spirit.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huanglian: 1.5 qian, washed with wine</li>
<li>Zhusha: 1 qian, water-calcinated</li>
<li>Raw Rehmannia: in wine</li>
<li>Danggui: in wine</li>
<li>Roasted Licorice: 0.5 taels each</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from Zhusha being water-calcinated, grind the four remaining ingredients into a fine powder, mix thoroughly, and use a decoction to moisten steamed dough to form pills the size of millet grains. Take 15 pills after meals with saliva to help swallow.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; says: When there is pain and anxiety in the heart, with vexation feeling as if one is unable to breathe, and frequent sighing, accompanied by a feeling of dread in the heart, this indicates a problem in the heart and abdomen. If there is abdominal pain, vexation, swelling, and periodic movement with pain, combined with a feeling of heat and thirst, it is due to parasites biting. One should press on the area with their hand to stabilize it without allowing it to shift, then use a large needle to puncture it, holding it for a long time until the worm stops moving, at which point the needle can be removed. Parasites in the intestines should not be treated with a small needle.</p>
<p><strong>Laziness and Lethargy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When one suffers from an ailment through the summer equinox and does not recover, it causes laziness.<br>[Note: In March and April, the energy resides in the spleen. If the spleen is unwell, it leads to lethargy.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Physiognomy of Healthy Individuals</strong></p>
<p>A weak pulse indicates relaxation, suggesting one should rest comfortably.<br>[Note: A weak pulse is associated with the spleen, indicating a deficiency in the organ&#39;s energy. Thus, relaxation indicates illness related to the spleen.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the True Nature of the Jade Machine</strong></p>
<p>When the winter pulse is excessive, it leads to difficulty in defecation, pain in the spine, and a lack of energy and desire to speak. <em>[Note: The kidneys are the source of vital energy and govern storage. If excessive, vital energy will leak outward, harming the root, resulting in lethargy and low energy. Insufficient yang energy causes pain in the spine. The heart governs speech, but if the root energy of the kidneys is damaged, there is a lack of desire to speak.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When the large intestine transfers heat to the stomach, one may have a good appetite yet remain thin; this is also referred to as dietary issues. *[Note: The stomach is responsible for receiving and processing food and drink, while the large intestine is the channel for transmission. When heat from the large intestine ascends and troubles the stomach, it leads to good appetite but also to weight loss. When yangming is dry and hot, the essence of the body cannot be produced, hence the individual may eat yet remain thin. &quot;Also&quot; refers to being able to eat while feeling lethargic, thus it is termed dietary issues.] The stomach can transfer heat to the gallbladder, also termed dietary issues. <em>[Note: All organs and bowels depend on the gallbladder. If gallbladder qi is dry and hot, yang cannot rise, leading to lethargy. When stomach qi is heated, it consumes food rapidly, hence it is also termed dietary issues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>The symptomatology of spleen wind includes excessive sweating, aversion to wind, sluggishness, reluctance to move the limbs, a pale yellow complexion, lack of appetite, with diagnosis found at the nose, appearing yellow. <em>[Note: Sluggishness and reluctance to move the limbs indicate a spleen disorder. The classics state: &quot;Those illnesses arising from the spleen lead to loss of appetite.&quot; The spleen is centrally located, hence diagnosis is found at the nose.]</em><a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Bi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Bi syndrome of the spleen manifests as weakness in the limbs, coughing, and vomiting of bile, leading to a major obstruction above. [Note: The qi of the spleen cannot circulate in the limbs, hence the weakness. Qi stagnation leads to coughing. Dietary intake enters the stomach, then ascends to the spleen and lungs; when the spleen qi cannot transform and transport, it results in vomiting bile, and when the lung qi cannot circulate properly, it results in a major obstruction above.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Illness</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: There is an illness with fever, weakness, profuse sweating as if bathing, aversion to wind, and shortness of breath. What illness is this? Qi Bo replied: It is called &quot;Alcohol Wind.&quot; The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qi Bo said: Use 10 parts of Ze Xie and Bai Zhu, and 5 parts of Mi Xian, combined into three finger amounts to be taken after meals. [Note: Excessive drinking leads to qi accumulation in the spleen, with internal heat rising, which causes fever throughout the body and weakness in the limbs. The excess heat generates wind, resulting in the sensation of wind and shortness of breath.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Acupuncture Essentials</strong></p>
<p>Acupuncture should avoid injuring the bones, as injury to the marrow will result in the depletion of essence, causing the body to weaken and become inactive. [Note: Excessive needling of the bones can injure the marrow. Insufficient marrow leads to dizziness, ear ringing, blurred vision, and a state of lethargy.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seasonal Acupuncture Interventions</strong><a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>In summer, the channels are pierced, and the blood and qi are depleted, leading to weakness.</p>
<p>[Note: In summer, the yang energy is abundant, but the blood and qi may have already exited through the collateral system. If one further draws from the channels, the blood and qi within will be exhausted, resulting in lethargy.]</p>
<p>Thunder Master said: There are those whose limbs are weak and lethargic, who cough up blood and have excessive bleeding, yet foolishly I diagnose it as lung injury, feeling the pulse as floating and large, yet I dare not treat it. A rough worker uses a stone needle, and many heal after excessive bleeding; they feel light as the blood stops. What is this? The Emperor said: You can treat many things, but with this illness, you are mistaken. It is like a swan flying straight into the sky. A sage treats illness by following the laws and principles, relating things by analogy, transforming thoroughly, following what is above and below, and there is no need to stick to the classics. </p>
<p>[Note: If there is spleen disease, there will be weakness; if water qi combines with Yangming, there will be wheezing and a rapid pulse; if the blood has nowhere to go, there will be bleeding. Those who recover from using the stone needle do so through the channels. Therefore, what you can treat also involves knowledge of methods concerning the channels. However, if the essence and qi of a single organ are interconnected within the central soil and ascend to the lung, then you greatly misunderstand this illness. Thus, the sage treats illness by following the methods of yin and yang, drawing analogies, as if a swan were flying straight into the sky. Hence, the sage observes the hidden transformations and follows the ups and downs of water and sky; there is no need to simply adhere to the classics.] </p>
<p>Now, if the pulse is floating, large, and vacuous, it indicates the absence of spleen qi, moving outside the stomach and returning to Yangming.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The two fiery elements cannot overcome the three watery elements; hence, the pulse becomes chaotic and lacks constancy. The limbs become weak and fatigued, which indicates the inability of the spleen&#39;s essence to circulate. Those who wheeze or cough have water and yangming interacting within them. Blood leakage occurs when the pulse is rapid and blood cannot flow properly. If one believes that the lungs are damaged, it is due to the loss of control leading to madness. Failing to consider analogous conditions shows ignorance.</p>
<p>(Note: This is a summary of the concepts presented in the original text, rephrased for clarity. The original context includes concepts of traditional Chinese medicine.)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Spiritual Pivot Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the Patterns of Disease in Organs Caused by Evil Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse of the lungs is thin and rapid, it signifies a cold-heat condition in the lungs, leading to lethargy, coughing up blood, and pain radiating to the waist and chest, as if there were nasal polyps causing obstruction. </p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Cold-heat in the lungs&quot; refers to cold and heat affecting the skin. The cold is external, which is why the pulse is thin and rapid. The lungs govern qi; lethargy, coughing up blood, pain in the waist and chest, and nasal obstruction indicate a deficiency of cold qi in the lungs.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>If the marrow sea is insufficient, then the brain turns and the ears ring, the shins are sore and dizziness occurs, the eyes see nothing, and there is a tendency to be lazy and rest. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The flow of nourishment and defense connects above and below, like a ring without an end. Now, when suddenly encountering evil qi or facing extreme cold, the hands and feet become lethargic, and the pathways of yin and yang lose their connection, how can qi return? Qibo said: The meeting of yin and yang in the four extremities is the great network of qi. The four pathways are the routes of qi. Therefore, if the network is severed, the pathways will be opened; if the four extremities are relaxed, then qi will merge together and flow like a ring. The Yellow Emperor said: Good. This is what is meant by a ring without an end, with no one knowing its limits; it ends and begins anew, this is what it refers to. </p>
<p>The merging of the flow of qi in the extremities signifies that the qi and blood of the skin flow from the four extremities into the vessels, circulate through the channels, and meet the qi and blood in the channels, entering between the elbows and knees to unite with the qi and blood in the vessels, hence it is said that when the four extremities are relaxed, qi will merge together. This illustrates how the evil wind and cold obstruct the four extremities, thus causing the hands and feet to be lethargic and the pathways to be blocked, how can qi circulate then? If the four extremities are in harmony, qi and blood will converge within the vessels, thus circulating in the paths of qi.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Diagnosing Weakness</strong></p>
<p>For those with weak flesh, it is appropriate to rest comfortably.<br>(Note: Weak flesh indicates deficiency of the spleen and stomach, hence the need for comfortable rest.)</p>
<p><strong>Spleen and Stomach Deficiency Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The deficiency of the spleen and stomach leads to laziness and a tendency to sleep. The limbs become unresponsive. During the autumn season, dryness prevails, and damp heat diminishes, causing a heavy body and joint pain. The mouth feels bitter and the tongue is dry; tastes of food are absent. Bowel movements are irregular, urination is frequent, there&#39;s a lack of appetite, and food is not digested well. There may also be respiratory issues, with chills and a lack of joy. The complexion appears poor and unbalanced, indicating insufficient yang qi. One should enhance yang and nourish the stomach with the Yang-Enhancing and Stomach-Nourishing Decoction.</p>
<p>The weakness of the spleen and stomach suggests that the qi from the upper jiao is also insufficient. In summer, when the heat is intense, it can deplete vital energy, leading to lethargy and unresponsive limbs. One lacks spirit and energy, with weak and limp legs. In the early morning and evening chill, while the yang qi rises during the day, heat can feel intense like fire. This indicates a deficiency in both yin and yang qi and blood—hence the remedy should be the Astragalus and Ginseng Decoction.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Internal injuries and similar illnesses are caused by the depletion of the heart and lung qi, leading to laziness and a desire to lie down, with heavy, unresponsive limbs. This is a result of heat damaging the original qi. The spleen governs the limbs, and when heat prevails, there is insufficient qi to move them. The scripture states: &quot;Heat damages qi&quot; and further states: &quot;When it is hot, bones dissolve and muscles weaken.&quot; This is what it refers to.</p>
<p>Regarding treatment:</p>
<p>For individuals who are overweight and feel heavy, lazy, and lethargic, it is due to damp-heat; it is advisable to use cang zhu, fu ling, and hua shi. For individuals who are overweight and pale, feeling heavy, lazy, and lethargic, it is due to qi deficiency; it is beneficial to use er zhu, ren shen, ban xia, cao guo, hou po, and shao yao. For those who are black and thin but still feel heavy, lazy, and lethargic, it is due to heat; white zhu and huang qin are recommended. When the spleen and stomach are affected by dampness, there is a sensation of heaviness and weakness, accompanied by laziness and a tendency to lie down.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Phlegm dampness is often accompanied by fatigue and weakness.</p>
<p>The stomach governs the generation of energy, and the spleen oversees movement. If both the spleen and stomach are deficient, the energy derived from food is insufficient, leading to further deficiency in the spleen. When the spleen is weak in its function of distributing energy to the limbs, there will be lethargy and weakness, hence the tendency to feel tired and sleepy. Additionally, overeating can impair the spleen&#39;s ability to transform and transport food, resulting in drowsiness and fatigue right after eating; however, this is temporary and will not persist after digestion. In such cases, one should nourish the spleen and stomach and also make use of digestive aids. If both the spleen and stomach are weak, with little food ingested, accompanied by chronic fatigue and weakness, then one must greatly nourish the spleen and stomach to fortify their capacity to transform, while being cautious not to lightly employ digestive agents that may over-tire them. With prolonged nourishment, once the spleen and stomach are strong, vitality will naturally increase, and fatigue will cease to exist.</p>

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The less yang pattern of malaria in the foot causes the body to feel relaxed; there is not much cold or heat, but one dislikes seeing others and feels uneasy upon seeing them, with much heat causing excessive sweating; acupuncture on the foot&#39;s lesser yang is indicated. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: A slight deficiency in qi causes the body to feel sluggish and unable to move; one feels heavy in the bones. This relates to supplementing the foot&#39;s lesser yang. The Yellow Emperor asks: What causes the disintegration of a person? Qibo replies: If the stomach is not full, all the meridians are deficient, and with deficient meridians, the tendons become lax, leading to an inability to use force. Therefore, it causes disintegration. To remedy this, supplement the muscle layers. The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; says: The zhangmen point governs the lethargy of the limbs and feelings of joy and anger. Points such as Wuli, Sanyangluo, Tianjing, Liyin, and Sanjian govern an inclination to sleep and a lack of movement in the limbs.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: In the beginning of June in the year Wu-Shen, the judge Bai Wenju, aged sixty-two, had a long-standing condition of weakness in the spleen and stomach. His eye ailment would occasionally appear, and his face and body became yellow; his urine varied between yellow and white, and his bowel movements were irregular. He had a decreased appetite, experienced shortness of breath, felt lethargic and had a desire to sleep, with his limbs lacking strength. By mid-June, the eye ailment recurred. The doctor administered a liver-clearing powder which caused several bowel movements, but the prior condition worsened. I argued that while rhubarb and cowherb could eliminate damp-heat, they did not traverse the meridians and instead first entered the stomach. Rhubarb is bitter and cold, which could further weaken the stomach; cowherb, though spicy, could also dispel Qi and greatly weaken the lung’s foundation, leading to an exacerbation of coughing. The root cause remained unaddressed, and the underlying deficiency worsened. Coupled with the seasonal heat and rain, this aggravated the condition in a patient with a history of jaundice. Therefore, it was necessary to tonify the deficiency in the spleen and lungs, eliminate the damp-heat from the exterior meridians, and prescribe the Qing Shen Yi Qi Decoction for treatment.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: Mr. Luo treated a sick monk who was pale, thin, and exhausted. Upon diagnosing his illness, Mr. Luo learned that the monk was from Sichuan and had left home while his mother was still alive. After spending seven years traveling in Zhejiang, one day he was overwhelmed by an unstoppable longing for his mother and wished to return home, but without any money. He could only look westward and weep, which led to his illness. The monk was twenty-five years old at that time. Mr. Luo instructed him to stay in a nearby place, providing him daily with tender meals made of beef and pig stomach cooked until soft. After more than half a month, he also spoke words of comfort to him. He said, &quot;Here are ten taels of silver for your travel expenses. I do not expect repayment; I only wish to save your life.&quot; Observing that the monk&#39;s condition was slightly improving, he gave him peach kernel and a purgative, applying it three times daily. The expelled matter consisted of blood clots and phlegm, which finally ceased. The next day, he gave him only cooked vegetables and thin gruel. After taking care of him for another half month, the monk returned to his previous state; another half month later, he left with the ten taels of silver. This led Mr. Luo to understand that the method of treatment must be based on whether the patient has a robust constitution; only then can effective treatment be applied. Otherwise, expelling evil can injure the vital energy, leading to minor ailments worsening and severe illnesses being fatal.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The &quot;Treasured Guide to Health&quot; states: In the autumn of the year of Bingchen, a man from Chuqiu County, aged twenty-seven, suffered from weakness in his limbs, restlessness with spontaneous sweating, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, cough with phlegm, chest discomfort, constipation, and emaciation. Over the course of a year, he consulted several doctors without improvement. Some said: a good doctor is not as good as a fortunate doctor. In a certain place, there was a doctor who, though not well-versed in prescriptions or pulse diagnosis, was adept at recognizing symptoms and had effective treatments. People referred to him as the fortunate doctor, and he was somewhat trusted, so they decided to have him treat the patient. </p>
<p>When the doctor arrived, he stated: I am well familiar with this illness, and my treatment will surely be effective. He applied moxibustion on the three acupuncture points in the lungs and gave pills of bitter orange and other ingredients to dispel phlegm and break up stagnation. After only a few doses, the patient experienced unrestrained diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite, leading to increasing fatigue, and ultimately he passed away.</p>
<p>In winter, I returned from military service and his father informed me. I replied: The classics say: “When the body and Qi are insufficient, the disease Qi is also insufficient; this indicates that both Yin and Yang are deficient. If treated with purgatives, it will exacerbate the deficiency.” Here, both Yin and Yang are depleted, the Qi and blood all exhausted, the five internal organs hollow, and the marrow of muscles and bones dried. The elderly would surely perish, and the young would not recover. If one does not replenish the deficiency, this is the principle. </p>
<p>The heir, having suffered from a long-standing illness and emaciation, indicates body insufficiency; shortness of breath indicates Qi insufficiency; restlessness, sweating, the desire to lie down, weakness in the limbs, and reluctance to speak indicate insufficiency of both Qi and blood. If one is cautious about not being timely in supplementation and instead uses toxic agents to purge, it will only deplete the already diminished state, causing further harm. If one does not die from this, what else remains?<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Case Records of Xue Ji&quot; states: A man, Yao Haishan, suffered from heatstroke, experiencing headaches and fever, with a high, wheezing breath and fatigue in his limbs, along with numbness in both hands. I diagnosed this as a case of heat damaging the vital energy, and treated him with Ren Shen Yi Qi Decoction, which immediately stabilized his condition. I also used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>My nephew, Fan Yundiao, experienced a strong cough with excessive phlegm, discomfort in the chest and abdomen, little desire to eat, fatigue in his limbs, a floating and large pulse, which, upon examination, felt weak. After taking Er Chen Wan and Zhi Ke and other medicines, his condition worsened. I concluded it was due to deficiency in the spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, which resulted in his recovery.</p>
<p>A woman complained of weakness in her legs and feet, leading to fatigue upon exertion. I stated that the limbs are governed by the earth element, indicating spleen deficiency; thus, she should take Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Huan Shao Dan. However, she did not heed my advice and insisted on taking Sou Feng Wan and Tian Ma Er Wan, ultimately leading to her demise from the wind elixir.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>During the time of the great advisor Li Beiquan, he experienced symptoms such as expectoration of phlegm, internal heat causing thirst, fatigue in the limbs, and a sensation of heat in the feet. Clearing the qi exacerbated the phlegm. I said: &quot;This is due to kidney water overflowing and transforming into phlegm; the method should be to tonify the kidneys.&quot; He was skeptical and instead took the Roll Phlegm Pill. After one dose, he experienced continuous vomiting and diarrhea, could not eat, and his eyes were closed; only then did he begin to believe. I then administered several doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, and gradually his stomach qi recovered. I followed this with the Six-Flavor Pill, and after a month, all his symptoms were completely resolved.</p>
<p>Governor Wang Tiancheng from Changping had cold sensations in his head, fatigue in his body, and felt slightly better after eating. However, exertion worsened his condition, and his pulse was floating and large, indicating spleen and lung deficiency. He recovered with a combination of the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction with Mulberry Leaf added. Later, due to overwork, he developed a fever, aversion to cold, delirium, and insomnia, but he felt slightly stable after eating, and I used the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction to cure him.</p>
<p>Great Sigh Gate</p>
<p>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</p>
<p>The Great Discussion on Qi Exchange</p>
<p>In the cycle of the earth that returns, a proper sigh is beneficial.<br>(Note: Those with gallbladder disorders tend to sigh more due to liver stagnation causing gallbladder qi to be unsteady, hence sighing serves to release it.)</p>
<p>The Great Discussion on the Five Constant Policies</p>
<p>In the Lesser Yin, if the heavens are dry, and despairing winds arise, there is pain in the hypochondrium and a tendency to sigh.<br>(Note: This pertains to liver and gallbladder disorders.)</p>
<p>The Ultimate Truth Great Discussion</p>
<p>In the year of Yangming at the spring, dryness dominates, causing the people to suffer from nausea and bitter vomiting, and they tend to sigh.<br>(Note: This relates to conditions where metal dominates leading to liver and gallbladder disorders.)<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Yangming&#39;s revival brings a great influx of clear qi, resulting in illness characterized by pain in the flanks, with qi returning to the left side, leading to frequent deep sighs. (Note: The illness marked by pain in the flanks and qi returning to the left indicates metal overcoming wood. The frequent deep sighs suggest wood suffering from the punishment of metal, which is also indicative of internal distress.)</p>
<p>The gallbladder channel is the foot Shaoyang channel. When active, it causes bitterness in the mouth and frequent deep sighs. (Note: This indicates that the Shaoyang qi is not rising. Shaoyang governs the initial vitality of Yang; thus, gallbladder qi rises, and the qi of the eleven organs also rises.) </p>
<p>Gallbladder distension results in pain and swelling under the flanks, with bitterness in the mouth, leading to frequent deep sighs. (Note: This indicates that the protective qi is counterflowing within the walls of the city, leading to organ distension.)</p>
<p>In cases of cold in the liver, symptoms include inability to lift both arms, a dry root of the tongue, frequent deep sighs, chest pain preventing turning, nausea with vomiting, and profuse sweating.</p>
<p>Prescription: Banxia Decoction, used to treat heat in the gallbladder, mental disorientation, cold and hot diarrhea, or nighttime sweating with aversion to wind, leading to frequent deep sighs. Ingredients: Banxia and dried ginger each 1.5 qian, Huangqin and Yuanzhi each 1 qian, Shengdihuang 2 qian, Shumi 1 he, and three qian of fried Suanzaoren, decocted in water as prescribed.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Wen Dan Decoction</strong> treats deficiency and fear of the heart and gallbladder, leading to frequent startled reactions and deep sighing. The ingredients include: Ban Xia, Zhi Shi, Bai Fu Ling, Chen Pi, and Yuan Zhi, each amounting to one qian; Gan Cao five fen; and Zhu Ru one ball. Boil with half a cup of water, three slices of ginger, and one jujube until reduced by seven parts to serve.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The disease of the foot Taiyin causes unhappiness, leading to frequent sighing, lack of appetite, alternating chills and fevers, excessive sweating, and when the illness worsens, it leads to vomiting; after vomiting, there is weakness, and it can be treated. In cases of liver disease, one appears pale and sighs frequently, resembling a dead person; needling the foot Jueyin should elicit blood. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: Gallbladder patients often sigh, experience bitter taste and regurgitation of undigested food, with a sensation of fullness below the heart and fear of being captured; there is a sound in the throat, frequent saliva production, and moxibustion should be applied where the pulse is weak at the foot Shaoyang. For conditions involving cold and heat, use Yanglingquan. Frequent vomiting, bitter regurgitation, prolonged sighing, and feelings of fear indicate that the evil resides in the gallbladder and reverses in the stomach; the gallbladder&#39;s fluid leakage causes bitterness in the mouth, and the reversed stomach energy causes bitter vomiting. Thus it is called &quot;vomiting bile.&quot; Treat the reversal below the Sanli point, needling the Shaoyang blood vessels to close off gallbladder reversal, and adjust the deficiency and excess to expel the evil.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: What causes people&#39;s deep sighs? Qibo replied: When worry and thought occupy the mind with urgency, the energy pathways become restricted. When restricted, it leads to discomfort, hence the deep sigh to release it, which affects the Heart of the Lesser Yin and the Lesser Yang of the foot, allowing for its retention. The &quot;Classic of Simple and Proper&quot; states: The complexion is pale, sighs resemble those of a dying person, accompanied by cold sweat and difficulty, indicating the condition of the Middle Burner. A deficiency in the spleen leads to illness, causing cold, unhappiness, and a tendency to sigh. Shangqiu governs it. Generally, those who frequently sigh have little appetite, experience a lot of cold and heat and sweating; when illness strikes, they may vomit easily, and once vomiting occurs, they weaken. This condition can be treated with Gongsun and Jingyu points. In reality, they may feel sharp pain in the abdomen, swelling of the head and face, restless drinking, and often have difficulty sleeping; in deficiency, there may be abdominal distension, filled with excessive gas, heat and pain, lack of appetite, and diarrhea. Gongsun governs this. The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; says: The tail of the dove governs cold and bloating in the heart, inability to eat, sighing, coughing up blood, acute heart pain, good at vomiting, heart hernia, and deep sighs. Shangqiu governs spleen deficiency, causing unhappiness and a tendency to sigh. The sun and moon, Great Horizontal, govern heat in the lower abdomen, with the urge to sigh. Shaochong governs sighing with annoyance and fullness, little energy, sadness, and fright.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the fire is intense, and the people suffer greatly, they become anxious and distressed, often resulting in sudden death.<br>(Note: This indicates that excessive heat injures the essence and blood.)</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>In the chapter on jaundice, it is said: When one experiences internal distress and heat in the heart, is unable to eat, and has intermittent urges to vomit, this is termed &quot;alcoholic jaundice.&quot; For alcoholic jaundice, when there is internal distress, sometimes with heat and pain, the main remedy is Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</strong> (Han Dynasty, by Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For Taiyang disease, the pulse is floating and rapid. A floating pulse indicates wind, rapid signifies heat, and movement suggests pain; rapid also indicates deficiency. If there is headache and fever with slight night sweats and a reversal of chills, the exterior has not yet resolved. If a physician wrongly purges it, the rapid pulse will transform to a slow one, and there will be opposing pain in the chest, emptiness in the stomach, external pathogenic qi moving the diaphragm, shortness of breath, restlessness, and internal distress of the heart. If the yang qi sinks within and the heart feels hardened, it results in &quot;heart knot.&quot; The main remedy for this is Da Xian Xiong Decoction. If there is no heart knot but sweating from the head and no sweating in other areas, with stiff neck and difficulty in urination, the body will definitely turn yellow.</p>
<p>For Yangming disease, the pulse is floating and tight, with a dry throat and bitter mouth, fullness in the abdomen and dyspnea, fever with sweating, but no aversion to cold, rather an aversion to heat, and heaviness in the body. If sweating occurs, it leads to restlessness, with the heart feeling disturbed, and the possibility of delirium; if further needling is applied, it will cause great anxiety and insomnia; if purged, the stomach will be empty, leading to the external pathogenic qi moving the diaphragm, resulting in internal distress of the heart.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For a fetus on the tongue, use the Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction as the primary treatment. If there is thirst with a desire for water and dry mouth, use the White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng. If the pulse is floating with fever, thirst wanting water, and difficulty in urination, use the Polyporus Decoction.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, if purged, there may be vexation in the heart and dry stool in the stomach, and it can be treated aggressively; if the abdomen is slightly distended, initially hard but later becomes loose, do not treat aggressively. If there is dry stool, Da Chengqi Decoction is appropriate.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, absence of sweating, difficulty in urination, and vexation in the heart indicate that the body will likely turn yellow.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, if purged and there is exterior heat with warm hands and feet, without fullness in the chest, vexation in the heart, inability to eat due to hunger, but only sweating on the head, use the Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction as the primary treatment.</p>
<p>In cases of winding cold damage with headache, rapid fever, resembling wind stroke, often with slight sweating and spontaneous vomiting, purging may increase vexation, leading to vexation in the heart as if starving; if sweating is induced, it may lead to convulsions, and the body becomes strong and difficult to bend or stretch; mist treatment may cause yellowing, and if there is prolonged difficulty in urination, it may result in coughing and vomiting.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety is a state of agitation and heat, characterized by restlessness and discomfort; in severe cases, it can resemble the effects of toxic substances like the seeds of the Palaquium plant or the Aconitum. When one is troubled and unable to sleep due to internal heat and stagnation of qi, there may be symptoms such as chest fullness and pain, or subtle sweating with restlessness. In such instances, the Zhizi Decoction is prescribed. If the person has low qi, add one qian of licorice; if there is nausea or if they initially took pills incorrectly, add half a liang of fresh ginger. For all cases of anxiety and restlessness, the Liangge Powder is very effective. Soaking the hands and feet in water can help dispel the heat from the heart and chest.</p>
<p>For those experiencing restlessness and fullness in the abdomen, unable to sit or lie down comfortably, the Zhizi and Houpo Decoction is indicated. If symptoms arise after bowel movements in a case of Yangming disease, characterized by agitation and anxiety, the San Yi Chengqi Decoction is appropriate. If restlessness and insomnia occur after sweating, use Wuling Powder or Liangge Powder. If there is dry mouth, moaning, and incoherence leading to insomnia, Wuling Powder or Huanglian Jiedu Decoction may help. For anxiety, Liangge Powder is suitable. For cases of Shaoyang syndrome with chest fullness without nausea, the Xiao Chaihu Decoction should omit Banxia and include Ren Shen and the fruit of the Trichosanthes.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Syndrome of Shen-Condition and Distress</h3>
<p>How can we explain the syndrome of shen-condition and distress? The term &quot;distress&quot; refers to the feeling of annoyance, while &quot;shen&quot; indicates a gloomy demeanor. It describes a state of inner annoyance and frustration, restlessness, and a feeling of gloom that makes one unable to relax, even more severe than mere annoyance. This arises when the yang pathogen invades through a deficiency and becomes trapped inside, causing stagnation in the chest. The classic text states: If the superficial condition is not resolved and the physician mistakenly purges, an empty stomach leads to internal disturbance, causing distress in the heart. It also states: Purging increases annoyance, and the heart feels distressed as if in hunger; this is due to the internal sinking of yang energy, resulting in various forms of distress.</p>
<p>The treatment methods may involve inducing vomiting or purging. If sweating, vomiting, and purging lead to restlessness and inability to sleep, or if symptoms are severe, the condition may alternate, causing distress in the heart. If treated like a Yangming disease with purging, when there is heat on the exterior, the hands and feet are warm but there is no chest fullness, and the heart feels distressed, accompanied by inability to eat yet sweating from the head, this indicates that evil heat is stagnant in the chest. In this case, one must use Zhizi Chih Tang to expel the stagnant heat.</p>
<p>For Yangming disease with purging that leads to heart distress and dryness in the stomach, if there is no sweating and urinary difficulty, causing subsequent yellowing, this indicates evil heat is consolidated in the stomach. In such cases, one must use DACHENGQI TANG or YINCHENTANG to attack and clear the internal heat. If one understands these principles, vomiting or purging will lead to recovery; with the correct modifications of decoctions, there will be no cases that do not heal. However, if one mistakenly induces sweating instead of purging to treat heat, various conditions may arise, often resulting in rashes or yellow symptoms.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: If there is spleen disease, there will be weakness; if water qi combines with Yangming, there will be wheezing and a rapid pulse; if the blood has nowhere to go, there will be bleeding. Those who recover from using the stone needle do so through the channels. Therefore, what you can treat also involves knowledge of methods concerning the channels. However, if the essence and qi of a single organ are interconnected within the central soil and ascend to the lung, then you greatly misunderstand this illness.

Hence, the sage observes the hidden transformations and follows the ups and downs of water and sky; there is no need to simply adhere to the classics.] </p>

<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The flow of nourishment and defense connects above and below, like a ring without an end. Now, when suddenly encountering evil qi or facing extreme cold, the hands and feet become lethargic, and the pathways of yin and yang lose their connection, how can qi return? Qibo said: The meeting of yin and yang in the four extremities is the great network of qi. The four pathways are the routes of qi. Therefore, if the network is severed, the pathways will be opened; if the four extremities are relaxed, then qi will merge together and flow like a ring. The Yellow Emperor said: Good. This is what is meant by a ring without an end, with no one knowing its limits; it ends and begins anew, this is what it refers to. </p>
<p>The merging of the flow of qi in the extremities signifies that the qi and blood of the skin flow from the four extremities into the vessels, circulate through the channels, and meet the qi and blood in the channels, entering between the elbows and knees to unite with the qi and blood in the vessels, hence it is said that when the four extremities are relaxed, qi will merge together. This illustrates how the evil wind and cold obstruct the four extremities, thus causing the hands and feet to be lethargic and the pathways to be blocked, how can qi circulate then?

<p>The deficiency of the spleen and stomach leads to laziness and a tendency to sleep. The limbs become unresponsive. During the autumn season, dryness prevails, and damp heat diminishes, causing a heavy body and joint pain. The mouth feels bitter and the tongue is dry; tastes of food are absent.

The complexion appears poor and unbalanced, indicating insufficient yang qi. One should enhance yang and nourish the stomach with the Yang-Enhancing and Stomach-Nourishing Decoction.</p>
<p>The weakness of the spleen and stomach suggests that the qi from the upper jiao is also insufficient. In summer, when the heat is intense, it can deplete vital energy, leading to lethargy and unresponsive limbs. One lacks spirit and energy, with weak and limp legs.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Internal injuries and similar illnesses are caused by the depletion of the heart and lung qi, leading to laziness and a desire to lie down, with heavy, unresponsive limbs. This is a result of heat damaging the original qi. The spleen governs the limbs, and when heat prevails, there is insufficient qi to move them. The scripture states: &quot;Heat damages qi&quot; and further states: &quot;When it is hot, bones dissolve and muscles weaken.&quot; This is what it refers to.</p>
<p>Regarding treatment:</p>
<p>For individuals who are overweight and feel heavy, lazy, and lethargic, it is due to damp-heat; it is advisable to use cang zhu, fu ling, and hua shi. For individuals who are overweight and pale, feeling heavy, lazy, and lethargic, it is due to qi deficiency; it is beneficial to use er zhu, ren shen, ban xia, cao guo, hou po, and shao yao. For those who are black and thin but still feel heavy, lazy, and lethargic, it is due to heat; white zhu and huang qin are recommended. When the spleen and stomach are affected by dampness, there is a sensation of heaviness and weakness, accompanied by laziness and a tendency to lie down.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Phlegm dampness is often accompanied by fatigue and weakness.</p>
<p>The stomach governs the generation of energy, and the spleen oversees movement. If both the spleen and stomach are deficient, the energy derived from food is insufficient, leading to further deficiency in the spleen. When the spleen is weak in its function of distributing energy to the limbs, there will be lethargy and weakness, hence the tendency to feel tired and sleepy. Additionally, overeating can impair the spleen&#39;s ability to transform and transport food, resulting in drowsiness and fatigue right after eating; however, this is temporary and will not persist after digestion. In such cases, one should nourish the spleen and stomach and also make use of digestive aids. If both the spleen and stomach are weak, with little food ingested, accompanied by chronic fatigue and weakness, then one must greatly nourish the spleen and stomach to fortify their capacity to transform, while being cautious not to lightly employ digestive agents that may over-tire them. With prolonged nourishment, once the spleen and stomach are strong, vitality will naturally increase, and fatigue will cease to exist.</p>

<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The less yang pattern of malaria in the foot causes the body to feel relaxed; there is not much cold or heat, but one dislikes seeing others and feels uneasy upon seeing them, with much heat causing excessive sweating; acupuncture on the foot&#39;s lesser yang is indicated. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: A slight deficiency in qi causes the body to feel sluggish and unable to move; one feels heavy in the bones. This relates to supplementing the foot&#39;s lesser yang. The Yellow Emperor asks: What causes the disintegration of a person? Qibo replies: If the stomach is not full, all the meridians are deficient, and with deficient meridians, the tendons become lax, leading to an inability to use force. Therefore, it causes disintegration. To remedy this, supplement the muscle layers. The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; says: The zhangmen point governs the lethargy of the limbs and feelings of joy and anger. Points such as Wuli, Sanyangluo, Tianjing, Liyin, and Sanjian govern an inclination to sleep and a lack of movement in the limbs.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: In the beginning of June in the year Wu-Shen, the judge Bai Wenju, aged sixty-two, had a long-standing condition of weakness in the spleen and stomach. His eye ailment would occasionally appear, and his face and body became yellow; his urine varied between yellow and white, and his bowel movements were irregular. He had a decreased appetite, experienced shortness of breath, felt lethargic and had a desire to sleep, with his limbs lacking strength. By mid-June, the eye ailment recurred. The doctor administered a liver-clearing powder which caused several bowel movements, but the prior condition worsened. I argued that while rhubarb and cowherb could eliminate damp-heat, they did not traverse the meridians and instead first entered the stomach. Rhubarb is bitter and cold, which could further weaken the stomach; cowherb, though spicy, could also dispel Qi and greatly weaken the lung’s foundation, leading to an exacerbation of coughing. The root cause remained unaddressed, and the underlying deficiency worsened. Coupled with the seasonal heat and rain, this aggravated the condition in a patient with a history of jaundice. Therefore, it was necessary to tonify the deficiency in the spleen and lungs, eliminate the damp-heat from the exterior meridians, and prescribe the Qing Shen Yi Qi Decoction for treatment.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: Mr. Luo treated a sick monk who was pale, thin, and exhausted. Upon diagnosing his illness, Mr. Luo learned that the monk was from Sichuan and had left home while his mother was still alive. After spending seven years traveling in Zhejiang, one day he was overwhelmed by an unstoppable longing for his mother and wished to return home, but without any money. He could only look westward and weep, which led to his illness. The monk was twenty-five years old at that time. Mr. Luo instructed him to stay in a nearby place, providing him daily with tender meals made of beef and pig stomach cooked until soft. After more than half a month, he also spoke words of comfort to him. He said, &quot;Here are ten taels of silver for your travel expenses. I do not expect repayment; I only wish to save your life.&quot; Observing that the monk&#39;s condition was slightly improving, he gave him peach kernel and a purgative, applying it three times daily. The expelled matter consisted of blood clots and phlegm, which finally ceased. The next day, he gave him only cooked vegetables and thin gruel. After taking care of him for another half month, the monk returned to his previous state; another half month later, he left with the ten taels of silver. This led Mr. Luo to understand that the method of treatment must be based on whether the patient has a robust constitution; only then can effective treatment be applied. Otherwise, expelling evil can injure the vital energy, leading to minor ailments worsening and severe illnesses being fatal.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Treasured Guide to Health&quot; states: In the autumn of the year of Bingchen, a man from Chuqiu County, aged twenty-seven, suffered from weakness in his limbs, restlessness with spontaneous sweating, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, cough with phlegm, chest discomfort, constipation, and emaciation. Over the course of a year, he consulted several doctors without improvement. Some said: a good doctor is not as good as a fortunate doctor. In a certain place, there was a doctor who, though not well-versed in prescriptions or pulse diagnosis, was adept at recognizing symptoms and had effective treatments. People referred to him as the fortunate doctor, and he was somewhat trusted, so they decided to have him treat the patient. </p>
<p>When the doctor arrived, he stated: I am well familiar with this illness, and my treatment will surely be effective. He applied moxibustion on the three acupuncture points in the lungs and gave pills of bitter orange and other ingredients to dispel phlegm and break up stagnation. After only a few doses, the patient experienced unrestrained diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite, leading to increasing fatigue, and ultimately he passed away.</p>
<p>In winter, I returned from military service and his father informed me. I replied: The classics say: “When the body and Qi are insufficient, the disease Qi is also insufficient; this indicates that both Yin and Yang are deficient. If treated with purgatives, it will exacerbate the deficiency.” Here, both Yin and Yang are depleted, the Qi and blood all exhausted, the five internal organs hollow, and the marrow of muscles and bones dried. The elderly would surely perish, and the young would not recover. If one does not replenish the deficiency, this is the principle. </p>
<p>The heir, having suffered from a long-standing illness and emaciation, indicates body insufficiency; shortness of breath indicates Qi insufficiency; restlessness, sweating, the desire to lie down, weakness in the limbs, and reluctance to speak indicate insufficiency of both Qi and blood. If one is cautious about not being timely in supplementation and instead uses toxic agents to purge, it will only deplete the already diminished state, causing further harm. If one does not die from this, what else remains?<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

Clearing the qi exacerbated the phlegm. I said: &quot;This is due to kidney water overflowing and transforming into phlegm; the method should be to tonify the kidneys.&quot; He was skeptical and instead took the Roll Phlegm Pill. After one dose, he experienced continuous vomiting and diarrhea, could not eat, and his eyes were closed; only then did he begin to believe. I then administered several doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, and gradually his stomach qi recovered. I followed this with the Six-Flavor Pill, and after a month, all his symptoms were completely resolved.</p>
<p>Governor Wang Tiancheng from Changping had cold sensations in his head, fatigue in his body, and felt slightly better after eating. However, exertion worsened his condition, and his pulse was floating and large, indicating spleen and lung deficiency. He recovered with a combination of the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction with Mulberry Leaf added. Later, due to overwork, he developed a fever, aversion to cold, delirium, and insomnia, but he felt slightly stable after eating, and I used the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction to cure him.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yangming&#39;s revival brings a great influx of clear qi, resulting in illness characterized by pain in the flanks, with qi returning to the left side, leading to frequent deep sighs. (Note: The illness marked by pain in the flanks and qi returning to the left indicates metal overcoming wood. The frequent deep sighs suggest wood suffering from the punishment of metal, which is also indicative of internal distress.)</p>
<p>The gallbladder channel is the foot Shaoyang channel. When active, it causes bitterness in the mouth and frequent deep sighs. (Note: This indicates that the Shaoyang qi is not rising. Shaoyang governs the initial vitality of Yang; thus, gallbladder qi rises, and the qi of the eleven organs also rises.) </p>
<p>Gallbladder distension results in pain and swelling under the flanks, with bitterness in the mouth, leading to frequent deep sighs. (Note: This indicates that the protective qi is counterflowing within the walls of the city, leading to organ distension.)</p>
<p>In cases of cold in the liver, symptoms include inability to lift both arms, a dry root of the tongue, frequent deep sighs, chest pain preventing turning, nausea with vomiting, and profuse sweating.</p>

<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The disease of the foot Taiyin causes unhappiness, leading to frequent sighing, lack of appetite, alternating chills and fevers, excessive sweating, and when the illness worsens, it leads to vomiting; after vomiting, there is weakness, and it can be treated. In cases of liver disease, one appears pale and sighs frequently, resembling a dead person; needling the foot Jueyin should elicit blood. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: Gallbladder patients often sigh, experience bitter taste and regurgitation of undigested food, with a sensation of fullness below the heart and fear of being captured; there is a sound in the throat, frequent saliva production, and moxibustion should be applied where the pulse is weak at the foot Shaoyang. For conditions involving cold and heat, use Yanglingquan. Frequent vomiting, bitter regurgitation, prolonged sighing, and feelings of fear indicate that the evil resides in the gallbladder and reverses in the stomach; the gallbladder&#39;s fluid leakage causes bitterness in the mouth, and the reversed stomach energy causes bitter vomiting. Thus it is called &quot;vomiting bile.&quot; Treat the reversal below the Sanli point, needling the Shaoyang blood vessels to close off gallbladder reversal, and adjust the deficiency and excess to expel the evil.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor said: What causes people&#39;s deep sighs? Qibo replied: When worry and thought occupy the mind with urgency, the energy pathways become restricted. When restricted, it leads to discomfort, hence the deep sigh to release it, which affects the Heart of the Lesser Yin and the Lesser Yang of the foot, allowing for its retention. The &quot;Classic of Simple and Proper&quot; states: The complexion is pale, sighs resemble those of a dying person, accompanied by cold sweat and difficulty, indicating the condition of the Middle Burner. A deficiency in the spleen leads to illness, causing cold, unhappiness, and a tendency to sigh. Shangqiu governs it. Generally, those who frequently sigh have little appetite, experience a lot of cold and heat and sweating; when illness strikes, they may vomit easily, and once vomiting occurs, they weaken. This condition can be treated with Gongsun and Jingyu points. In reality, they may feel sharp pain in the abdomen, swelling of the head and face, restless drinking, and often have difficulty sleeping; in deficiency, there may be abdominal distension, filled with excessive gas, heat and pain, lack of appetite, and diarrhea. Gongsun governs this. The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; says: The tail of the dove governs cold and bloating in the heart, inability to eat, sighing, coughing up blood, acute heart pain, good at vomiting, heart hernia, and deep sighs. Shangqiu governs spleen deficiency, causing unhappiness and a tendency to sigh. The sun and moon, Great Horizontal, govern heat in the lower abdomen, with the urge to sigh. Shaochong governs sighing with annoyance and fullness, little energy, sadness, and fright.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>
