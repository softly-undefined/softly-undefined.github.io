      <div><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Compendium of Books on Medicine, Volume 322</strong></p>
<p><strong>Irritability Door</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essentials of the True and Great Theory</strong></p>
<p>When the lesser yang prevails, fire overcomes, causing the people to suffer from anxiety and heat in the chest.<br><em>Note: Anxiety is caused by excessive fire and heat.</em></p>
<p>When the lesser yin prevails, heat below the heart manifests, leading to hunger, retrograde movement beneath the navel, and nausea along with irritability.<br><em>Note: The external fire mingles with the internal.</em></p>
<p>When the lesser yang prevails, heat lodges in the stomach, resulting in anxiety and heart pain.<br><em>Note: The energy of the lesser yang corresponds to the triple burner, thus heat lodges in the stomach. The triple burner and the heart are interconnected, hence causing anxiety and heart pain.</em> When the lesser yin recurs, internal heat arises, leading to irritability.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>【 Note: Irritation, due to excessive heat and restlessness.】 When the lesser yang returns, great heat is approaching, causing heart heat and irritation. 【 Note: Heart heat and irritation arise from heat affecting the heart and lungs.】 The lesser yin governs the heavens; when it prevails, it causes heart heat and irritation. 【 Note: This is due to the victory of the energies of the two fires, the sovereign and minister.】 All forms of restlessness and mania are related to fire. 【 Note: Fire refers to the ministerial fire encompassed by the lesser yang.】</p>
<p>In the years when wood is excessive, the winds circulate, and the spleen is afflicted, the people suffer from heaviness and irritation. 【 Note: Water energy ascends to the heart, hence the irritation.】 In the years when earth is excessive, when rain and moisture circulate, the kidneys are afflicted by evil, causing the people to suffer from heaviness and irritation. 【 Note: Water cannot nourish fire, hence the irritation.】 In the years when metal is excessive, when dryness circulates, the liver is afflicted, causing the people to suffer from heaviness and irritation. 【 Note: Deficiencies in the kidneys, spleen, and liver all lead to heaviness and irritation.】 In the years when water is excessive, when cold energy circulates, it harms the heart fire, causing the people to suffer from bodily heat and restless heart palpitations. 【 Note: Restlessness and palpitations occur when water dominates the heart. Restlessness arises when fire does not interact with yin.】 In years when water is insufficient, excessive humidity prevails, causing the people to suffer from irritation.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>[Note: The cold qi rises, hence the illness brings annoyance and grievance.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Five Constancies</strong></p>
<p>The sun governs the heavens; the heart is hot and troubled.<br><strong>[Note: The heart is hot and troubled, indicating that fire is boiling above.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is troubled and the head hurts, the illness resides in the diaphragm, affected by the hand&#39;s Great Yang and Lesser Yin.<br><strong>[Note: The fire qi of the sovereign, when subjected to external evil, troubles the heart internally. The sun’s qi suffering from evil results in a headache above. The illness is in the diaphragm, hence it affects the hand&#39;s Great Yang and Lesser Yin channels.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Regulating the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>When the blood rises, the qi falls, the heart is troubled and easily angered. When the blood falls, the qi rises, confusion reigns and joy is forgotten.<br><strong>[Note: When blood rises, the pulse and qi are full, causing heart distress. When qi settles below, it cannot spread, leading to increased anger. When blood descends, it accumulates below, resulting in forgetfulness. When qi rises, it causes confusion above.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Needling Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of spleen heat, one feels a heaviness in the head, cheek pain, a troubled heart, a pale complexion, and a desire to vomit, along with body heat.<br><strong>[Note: The spleen channels connect to the heart, hence heart trouble leads to a pale complexion. Heat evil attacks the stomach, causing a desire to vomit. The spleen governs muscles, which causes body heat.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Essential Principles of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The terminal stage of Jueyin manifests as internal heat, dry throat, and irritability.<br><em>[Note: Irritability refers to the ascending heat of the pericardium qi.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the True Organs of Jade Machine</strong></p>
<p>When the summer pulse is insufficient, it causes irritability, leading to cough and spitting above, and gas leakage below.<br><em>[Note: Insufficiency causes a reversal internally, leading to irritability; it ascends to affect the lungs, causing cough and spitting, and descends to affect the abdomen, causing gas leakage.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Lingshu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Channels and Vessels</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of the Kidney corresponds to the Shaoyin, and it primarily governs diseases arising from the Kidneys, leading to irritability and heart pain.<br><em>[Note: Water does not assist fire.]</em><br>The heart corresponds to the hand Jueyin pericardium and is responsible for diseases arising from its pulse, leading to irritability, heart pain, and heat in the palms.<br><em>[Note: Irritability and heart pain with heat in the palms arise from internal to external.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Five Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Clear qi is in the yin, and turbid qi is in the yang. Nutritional qi flows smoothly in the meridians, while defensive qi flows in reverse. With the mingling of clear and turbid, chaos arises within the chest, known as great unrest. Thus, when qi is chaotic in the heart, it leads to intense irritability and a tendency to bow the head in silence.<br><em>[Note: The mingling of clear and turbid indicates the interaction between nutritive and defensive qi, corresponding to the pathways of yin and yang, causing disarray in the chest and heart.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis of the Golden Coffer</strong><br><em>[Author: Zhang Ji of the Han Dynasty]</em><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Irritability, Disease, Pulse Diagnosis, and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on upper qi states: If one has lung distention, coughs and has difficulty breathing, feels irritable and wheezes, with a floating pulse, there is water in the heart. Xiao Qing Long Decoction plus gypsum is the remedy.</p>
<p>The chapter on water qi states: Those with heart water feel heavy, have little energy, cannot lie down, are irritable and restless, and have swelling in the lower body.</p>
<p>In cases of Taiyang disease, with a floating and tight pulse, swelling and coldness in the body, resembling joint pain, blockage in the chest preventing food intake, and pain accumulating, with evening irritability leading to sleeplessness, this is yellow sweat. Those with this condition will have thirst, diarrhea, and frequent urination; sweating is not advisable.</p>
<p>The chapter on deficiency labor states: In cases of deficiency labor, if one feels irritable and cannot sleep, Suan Zao soup is the remedy.</p>
<p>If the patient appears hot and feels full, has a dry mouth and thirst, yet the pulse shows no heat, this indicates hidden yin, signifying blood stasis, and requires purgation.</p>
<p>The chapter on diarrhea states: If diarrhea leads to further irritability, with a moist sensation upon palpating under the heart, this indicates deficiency irritability, and Zhi Zi Chi decoction is the remedy.</p>
<p>The chapter on lung atrophy states: If there is difficulty in breathing and irritability, it is attributed to lung distention, which may lead to water retention; sweating can alleviate it.</p>
<p>The chapter on abdominal fullness states: If the patient appears emaciated and yellow, is irritable but not thirsty, has coldness and fullness in the chest, and persistent diarrhea, this condition is fatal.</p>
<p>The chapter on jaundice states: In cases of Yangming disease with a slow pulse, if one finds it difficult to eat enough, feeling full leads to irritability and dizziness, and urination becomes difficult, this indicates the onset of gall bladder jaundice. Although purging is done, the abdominal fullness remains unchanged due to the slow pulse.</p>
<p>In cases of abdominal fullness with emaciation, irritability leading to sleeplessness, this is associated with the yellow family.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Techniques</strong> by Wang Shuhe of the Jin Dynasty</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Method</strong></p>
<p>The Heart Pulse Song states: Overflowing at the joints causes bone pain and heart restlessness, accompanied by a flushed face.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Diseases Lifes and Deaths Song states: Both internal and external deficiencies lead to body coldness, with sweating like pearls and slight nausea causing distress. Suddenly, the hands and feet pulse with reversal, and if the body is not at ease, death is certain.</p>
<p>The Deficient Pulse Song states: In a daze, the heart is filled with palpitations and shock, making the pulse difficult to establish at the three positions. Blood deficiency in the organs provokes heat, and nourishing the Sanjiao will bring peace.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>If the Yin pulse is not congested, the body feels cold, there is internal restlessness, excessive saliva, dry lips, and difficulty urinating, this indicates lung atrophy. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, and lung distension. The pulse is floating, there is water in the heart region, and pain under the ribs that radiates to the back. If there is a solid condition, the person will be irritable and often lean against objects; Xiao Qing Long Decoction with gypsum is the treatment for this.</p>
<p>If there is retained fluid, absence of active manifestation, no fever, a weak and slightly agitated pulse, inability to eat, and a deep slippery pulse, this indicates a disease of retained fluid.</p>
<p>In cases of a solid constitution, there will be bitterness, restlessness, and heat. When a person&#39;s pulse has been diagnosed and yet still experiences slight agitation, it suggests the illness is regarded as improved; however, if strong food is provided, the spleen and stomach are still weak and unable to digest the food, leading to mild agitation. Reducing food intake will result in recovery.</p>
<p>If the diagnosis shows accumulated heat in the heart with a knotted pulse, there may be erratic sensations in the upper and lower body, fullness and palpitations in the chest, internal heat, a red face, dry throat, heart agitation with warmth in the palms, and severe cases may result in vomiting blood and skin maladies, indicating blood stasis. This is notable in summer heat and winter severity, with a red complexion.</p>
<p>For heart ailments with fullness, slight shortness of breath, and a great deal of heat, heat rises in the heart, leading to nausea and vomiting, wild speech, sweat like pearls, cold body extremities; the pulse should be floating but is instead deep and slippery, with color expected to be red yet appearing black. This indicates that water is overcoming fire, which is a grave reversal, with a high death rate and unlikely to be treated successfully.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>In cases of cold damage illness without fever, but with restless and frantic speech, not directed toward someone who can help, do not force with fire treatments. Instead, administer a dose of Zhuling powder the size of a thumb, together with one liter of freshly drawn water; if difficult, two liters may be used. Encourage vomiting by pressing on the throat, and the illness will resolve. If vomiting cannot be induced, do not forcibly give water, as water retention can lead to a blockage below the heart; instead, use the remaining medicine to induce vomiting.</p>
<p>For those with虚烦 (restlessness due to deficiency heat), it resembles cold damage but does not dislike cold and has no body pain, indicating it is not a cold damage illness, so sweating is not appropriate. There is no headache, and the pulse is not tight and rapid, which indicates it is not internal excess, so purging is also not suitable. In such cases, both internal and external treatments are inappropriate; if forced, there is a risk of severe depletion and death—recovery is difficult. This restlessness should be treated with bamboo leaf soup. If there is vomiting, administer a dose of tangerine peel soup; if not healed, it can be repeated. This method has been effective when used multiple times. For restlessness following cold damage, this soup is also advisable.</p>
<p>If vomiting and purging do not cease, with fever and heart disturbance, and a desire to drink water, a small amount of rice flour water is preferable. If unable to vomit, administer Kudzu root and ephedra drink.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The root of vexation lies in a restless heart. Humans possess vital energy, which is divided into nourishing and protective functions, distinguished by yin and yang. When nourishment and protection are harmonious, then yin is balanced and yang is concealed, and the spirit is in good order. If nourishment and protection are mismanaged, causing imbalance in yin and yang, one may suffer from excessive dominance of one over the other: either yin is deficient while yang is excessive, or yang is deficient while yin is excessive. The Suwen states: if yang is deficient, there will be external cold; if yin is deficient, there will be internal heat. When yang is excessive, there will be external heat; when yin is excessive, there will be internal cold. The current condition of vexation is due to internal heat arising from yin deficiency. However, there are various presentations of vexation that must be distinguished. After grave illnesses like typhoid or cholera, or following childbirth, individuals may experience feelings of restlessness and vexation. Likewise, those with chronic exhaustion may suffer from internal heat of the heart, leading to vexation. Therefore, the treatment methods must be carefully examined.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Living Man&#39;s Book</strong> 【Song, Zhu Hong】</p>
<p><strong>Syndrome of Irritability due to Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>Irritability due to cold damage is often associated with the greater yang and lesser yin meridians. The greater yang meridian may also become involved due to constipation, where there are hard stools leading to irritability. Generally, when yin energy is deficient and yang energy predominates, there is heat and irritability. Hence, irritability often accompanies cold damage and wind invasions in the greater yang meridian. When yang is deficient and yin prevails, it also leads to irritability, as weakened yang is taken over by yin, thus lesser yin conditions can also present with irritability. This can be distinguished through exterior signs and pulse examination. Additionally, there are cases where those who sweat become irritable, those who have had diarrhea become irritable, and even those who have resolved illness but are still slightly irritable. This is due to the illness being newly resolved, struggling to handle food intake; reducing food will alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Hejian Six Writings</strong> 【Jin, Liu Wansuo】</p>
<p><strong>Irritability</strong><a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Restlessness and agitation arise from a disturbed and hot state, indicative of fire. When external heat is excessive, the limbs become restless; when internal heat is excessive, the mind becomes agitated, leading to cyclical madness and worries that prevent sleep. If one experiences nausea and attributes it to a cold stomach while feeling upset, that is incorrect. Thus, when the heart is troubled and pain persists, the emptiness of the abdomen generates heat, and consuming hot food alleviates this. If there is reversed qi causing agitation, it is commonly referred to as a throat issue, resulting from the decline of water and the rise of fire, similar to the movement of fire. Therefore, agitation in the heart and chest is called “zhengchong,” often referred to as heart distress, all attributable to heat.</p>
<p>For those who experience tumultuous thoughts and repeated insomnia due to internal heat and stagnant qi, or chest fullness and pain, or slight sweating with restlessness, the prescription of Zhi Zi Tang is indicated. If there is qi deficiency, add one coin of licorice; if there is nausea or initial mistakes with herbal pills, add half a tael of fresh ginger. For all who suffer from restlessness and fatigue, the cooling Ge San is excellent, and it is also beneficial to wash the hands and feet with warm water to help disperse and resolve the chest heat. Those with heart disturbance and abdominal fullness, unable to sit or lie still, should use the Zhi Zi Hou Po Tang. This applies to cases post-Yangming disease where there is restlessness and frustration. For post-sweating agitation and insomnia, Wu Ling San or Liang Ge San may be used. For dry mouth and groans, incoherence, and inability to sleep, Wu Ling San and Huang Lian Jie Du Tang should be administered. For heart distress, Liang Ge San is recommended. In cases of Shaoyang syndrome with chest discomfort without nausea, Xiao Chai Hu Tang minus half a summer, with added Bei Mu, is the prescription of choice.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Huangdi Needle Classic,&quot; in its chapter on the five disturbances, states: When the qi is disordered in the heart, it results in a troubled and silent mind, lowering the head and remaining still. It also says: The qi residing in the heart should be addressed by focusing on the lesser yin heart master point. Furthermore, it mentions that coughing and breathlessness indicate the kidney qi is in rebellion. It reiterates that for restlessness, one should focus on the foot lesser yin. Similarly, for agitation, one should focus on the foot greater yin. Zhongjing divides these into two types: restlessness and agitation. When fire enters the lungs, it leads to restlessness; when it enters the kidneys, it leads to agitation. Both involve the kidneys since the pathways connect to the lung&#39;s mother. Generally, both restlessness and agitation stem from heart fire as the ailment. The heart is the sovereign fire; when fire is excessive, metal is worn away, and water is depleted, leaving fire to exist alone, thus resulting in agitation where the lungs and kidneys converge. Additionally, the spleen is connected within the heart, and the heart channel arises from the spleen, leading to mutual conflict and the generation of damp-heat, which causes agitation.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Those who are troubled are restless and chaotic in heart, intensely wanting to vomit, in a state of confusion and unease; those who are agitated are hot at all times, sweating profusely, and after a short while, they cease. The classics say: “This is the state of Yin agitation.” Zhongjing notes that the red color and bitter taste of Gardenia fruit enter the heart and treat agitation; while the black color and salty taste of fermented soybeans enter the kidneys and treat restlessness, this is called the Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction, a divine remedy. If there is residual food causing agitation, the Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction shall be the remedy.</p>
<p>In the extreme state of Yin agitation, one wishes to sit in a well; Yang has already departed. If the physician still fails to understand and mistakenly attributes this to heat, and treats it with cold medicines, how can one avoid death? Moreover, when cold and cooling agents enter the abdomen, the fire throughout the body, upon receiving the water, will rise and escape. </p>
<p>Fire entering the lungs causes agitation; fire entering the kidneys causes restlessness. When both agitation and restlessness are present above, it is because the kidneys connect to the lung&#39;s mother. The discharge is as moist as oil, with persistent panting, which signifies the lungs are in distress. The nose is the external symbol of the lungs; the lung Qi connects to the nose, and if the breath from the nose is coarse and substantial, it reflects the state of the lungs.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>When the blood is depleted, the kidney qi governs it. When the hair is as moist as oil, fire compels the kidney water to its highest limit, indicating that water is about to be exhausted. Zhongjing noted that moist hair and wheezing signal a depletion of the lungs, which also relates to the kidneys. Since the hair is at the top of the body and belongs to the kidneys, yet the lungs are the highest of the five organs, it follows that depletion of the lungs implicates the kidneys as well. Generally, the lungs and kidneys are interconnected; if the lungs are already depleted, the kidneys’ depletion is also implied. </p>
<p>Some may say: &quot;Those who are anxious are troubled by the heart; those who are agitated are stirred by the heart. Why is anxiety linked to the lungs and agitation to the kidneys?&quot; The heart is the ruler of fire and connects with pathogenic heat, transmitting heat up and down, consuming metal and depleting water, leaving fire to persist. Thus, the lungs and kidneys combine with the heart to create anxiety and agitation. Although the anxiety relates to the lungs and the agitation to the kidneys, it is ultimately the heart fire that causes it. If one experiences anxiety and agitation due to retained food, the prescription for this is the Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>When there is a condition of internal heat, it resembles the case of those who regularly practice virtue and fast. In such people, the stomach&#39;s vital energy has long been deficient, and if this deficiency arises from overexertion, it resembles the heat caused by the Yangming condition treated with Baihu Decoction. One will definitely feel a strong heat upon touch of the body, experience restlessness and intense heat, and have a great thirst for water due to excessive labor, along with body aches. When the illness first presents, it bears a resemblance to the internal heat that arises externally; if mistakenly treated with Baihu Decoction, death is certain within ten days. This condition signifies great deficiency of spleen and stomach, with inadequate original Qi, leading to shortness of breath through the mouth and nose. After the day turns, if it is the Yangming condition at the right time, the illness will surely lessen. If it is a case of external internal heat, by evening the symptoms will become pronounced, heat will increase, thirst will be intense, and there will be constant irritability. If the exertion was insufficient, this condition will not manifest, and it is particularly prone to resolution. In case of ambiguous symptoms that are hard to diagnose, it is advisable to wait one or two days for medical treatment; errors will not occur.</p>
<p>Regarding Gardenia and Bean Decoction:</p>
<p>Restlessness pertains to Qi, while irritability pertains to blood. Qi governs the lungs, and blood governs the kidneys. Thus, gardenia is used to treat lung restlessness, and fragrant beans are used to treat kidney irritability. Restlessness and irritability may result in insomnia. For those with a deficiency of Qi and a feeling of fullness, add licorice. If there is vomiting, add fresh ginger and dried tangerine peel. For fullness in the lower abdomen combined with restlessness, use Gardenia, Magnolia Bark, and Bitter Orange Decoction. For mild heat and slight restlessness in the lower body, use Gardenia, Licorice, and Dried Ginger Decoction.<br><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong> [Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng]<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Patterns and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For excessive heat in the chest, one must use Gardenia fruit; if there is true heat causing agitation, Gardenia fruit should also be used. If there is deficiency heat with agitation, it is advisable to use Ginseng, Astragalus, Ophiopogon, White Poria, Bamboo leaves, and White Peony. If the pulse is forceful and rapid with true heat, Shenqi Pill should be administered.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>After profuse sweating, purging, or vomiting, if a significant amount of fluids has been lost leading to dryness in the five interior organs, one may experience vexation due to insufficient yin blood to nourish yang, causing an excess of yang energy. Thus, deficiency heat arises along with agitation, which calls for a Ginseng Decoction, removing the Su ingredient and doubling the Ginseng, combined with a half dose of Ophiopogon. If the patient is thirsty, a simple Ginseng Decoction is sufficient. If there are issues with urination, Chunze Decoction should be added. If there is heat in the heart channel causing agitation, Chen-shi Wuling Powder is appropriate. For agitation accompanied by vomiting and lack of appetite, Tangerine Peel Decoction should be used. If agitation leads to restlessness, Warm Gallbladder Decoction is required. For severe agitation and high body heat, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction is optimal. If blood deficiency causes agitation and exhibits the previously mentioned symptoms, Poria Heart Tonifying Decoction is suitable. </p>
<p>In cases where the patient exhibits chills without pain in the body or head, but feels hot and agitated, it is also termed deficiency vexation, and both internal and external treatments should be avoided, as they might lead to harm. Instead, employ a Ginseng Decoction, removing the Su ingredient and doubling the Ginseng, or add a half dose of Gypsum; if there is no improvement, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction should be administered. If additional symptoms from earlier cases are present, select from the previously mentioned remedies. For patients who are severely deficient, it is not advisable to use cooling agents exclusively; Poria Heart Tonifying Decoction should be given.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Those experiencing anxiety are often affected by the seven emotions and six desires, which lead to a deficiency of kidney water and an agitated heart fire. This may arise from residual heat after various illnesses, excessive labor causing depletion of qi and an excess of fire, or from yin deficiency triggering internal fire, resembling initial symptoms of typhus with external fever but no pain in the head or body, and a distinct pulse that is not tight or rapid. Even with yin deficiency, patients may still feel cold but not severely; the pulse can be rapid yet weak. </p>
<p>For general cases with post-illness weakness, anxiety, and a desire to vomit, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction; for lighter cases, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If there is phlegm counterflow and nausea, use Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction. For internal cold and external heat with limb pain, but the mouth not dry and feeling weak, use Yin Dan Decoction. If after taking cooling medicines the pulse becomes larger but weaker, and the heat increases with agitation and thirst, use Single Ginseng Decoction, or a Ginseng and Astragalus Decoction, or administer Wuliang Powder. For those laboring with qi deficiency, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For yin deficiency, add Bai Shao and Huang Bo to Si Wu Decoction. For weakness of the spleen and stomach, use San Bai Decoction. For palpitations with excessive phlegm, use Wen Dan Decoction. For those whose spirit is unsettled, use Zhu Sha An Shen Pill. For women postpartum with blood deficiency and agitation, add Ginseng, Light Bamboo Leaf, Ophiopogon, and Licorice to Si Wu Decoction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>To express exterior deficiency, one should avoid sweating; to address internal deficiency, one should avoid purging. It is best to use harmonizing remedies for treatment. The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: for deficiency-related vexation, one must not attack aggressively; when the heat dissipates, cold will arise. If strong sweating or purging is used to treat deficiency-related vexation, it may lead to severe fluid depletion and death; if mild, it may cause internal loss of fluids accompanied by night sweats, potentially turning into consumption. In cases of cold damage with vexation without prior sweating, vomiting, or purging, there can be fullness in the chest and real heat; while in those who have already undergone sweating, vomiting, or purging, there may be chest fullness with agitation and frustration, as detailed in various categories.</p>
<p>Vexation and thirst in the heart, desire to vomit, bodily heat, and restless sleep along with fever belong to exterior heat. However, vexation may occur without ceasing, with sporadic episodes of heat that start and stop. Any vexation not alleviated by sweating, vomiting, or purging indicates the transmission of evil heat internally. If there is no chest fullness but a desire to vomit that cannot be fulfilled, it indicates depression due to deficiency, and harmonization or mild sweating should suffice. The classics say: when a patient has vexation and sweats, it is a sign of relief. If there is sudden fullness in the heart accompanied by vexation, it indicates real heat, and there may be differences in terms of vomiting or purging. The poem states: mild vexation is indicative of the supremacy of yang, suggesting that treatment should be differentiated between external and internal. Additionally, extreme vexation leading to reversal and cold extremities indicates a disturbance from yin, suggesting that extreme heat resulting in reversal, along with the predominance of yin, must be treated with the Four Reversal Principles Decoction; it is advisable to reference the section on palpitation as well.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Medical Overview: Discussion on Disturbances of the Heart</strong></p>
<p>Disturbances that cause restlessness and heat are known to involve the heart and lungs; therefore, we use bamboo leaves, gypsum, and cinnabar to calm and descend the heat. When there is restlessness accompanied by diarrhea, it indicates heat in the upper body, and thus, we use Gardenia and Pericarpium Ziziphi Jujubae Decoction to induce vomiting. If there is restlessness with sweating that does not alleviate the condition, it suggests evil influences inside and outside the body; hence, we prescribe decoctions to clear both surfaces. A deep pulse with thirst and warm palms indicates heat not on the surface; therefore, we use the Miraculous Fragrance Pill to treat it. Warming the Gallbladder and using sour jujubes can remedy insomnia. </p>
<p>Generally, when the heart is deficient, it can lead to restlessness; deficiencies in the liver, kidneys, or spleen can also cause the heart to be restless. The classics state: the pulse of summer correlates to the heart, and when this is unbalanced, it results in restlessness. It also states: deficiencies in the liver, kidneys, and spleen can weigh the body down with restlessness, which indicates that disturbances often arise from deficiency.</p>
<p>The &quot;Living Person&quot; text suggests that deficiency-related disturbances resemble those caused by cold damage, yet they are not the same. Cheng Wujin states: cold damage can involve these disturbances, causing restlessness in the heart or the chest. These two perspectives differ. By examining the texts, Cheng Wujin’s claims indeed derive from Zhongjing and the &quot;Living Person&quot; lacks concrete evidence. However, often it&#39;s observed that disturbances arise in the absence of cold damage, thus we consider both views.</p>
<p>Deficiency disturbances may include sensations of heat in the body, dizziness and pain in the head, dryness in the mouth and throat without thirst, insomnia, all signify deficiency-related disturbances. In cases of unease when rising or lying down, and instability in sleep, they are termed disturbances. These conditions should be treated with Gardenia and Pericarpium Ziziphi Jujubae Decoction, or bamboo leaves and gypsum decoction.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Cold Damage Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When the evil heat penetrates the interior without going through sweating, vomiting, or purging, it results in vexation and heat, which appears similar to but is different from fever. The classics say: when a patient has a fever, if sweating occurs, relief follows. If there is no manifestation of heat in the diaphragm, one should merely harmonize and resolve the mild heat. If there is fullness below the heart and vexation, the distinctions between vomiting and purging should be made based on the reality or emptiness of the symptoms, thus determining the lightness or heaviness of the treatment. If vexation precedes palpitation, it indicates a substantial condition; if palpitation precedes vexation, it indicates an empty condition. An empty vexation may also present as a desire to vomit and a feeling of gloomy discomfort. Various forms of empty vexation and heat resemble Cold Damage, but notably do not experience aversion to cold, do not have headaches, and do not have body aches, which sets them apart. When the exterior is already deficient, one should not induce sweating; when the interior is not substantial, one should not induce purging. Shuhe states: empty vexation with heat should not be aggressively attacked. For kidney cold damage, where there is no heat in the interior or exterior, but the person feels vexed and does not wish to see light, sometimes accompanied by abdominal pain, the pulse is deep and thin, one can use the Four Reversal Decoction.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Disturbance causes irritation, and restlessness leads to anger; restlessness follows irritation and gradually intensifies. In cases of febrile disturbance, there are distinctions between yin and yang, deficiency and excess. When the heart is hot, there is irritation; this indicates yang excess and yin deficiency. When the kidney is hot, there is restlessness, indicating yin excess and yang deficiency. Irritation is a mild form of heat, while restlessness is an intense form. If there is an obstruction within causing irritation and restlessness, or if one is not bothered yet suddenly becomes restless and depressed, this signifies a yang excess blocking yin, desiring to lie in muddy water, yet unable to drink water.</p>
<p>For those with chest obstruction and symptoms of irritation, vomiting, and diarrhea, the prescription is Si Ni Tang. If irritation and diarrhea occur with fever and counterflow, if one is unable to sleep due to restlessness, experiences chills and spasms, and has pulses that are absent yet restless, this condition is hard to treat. </p>
<p>When yin extreme causes restlessness, or when yin poison and fire pathogens are present, using hot medications can exacerbate the condition; hence, cool medicines should not be employed. If restlessness is severe, one may still need to use heating agents like Si Ni Tang and similar formulas.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Principles</strong> [By Wang Kentang, Ming Dynasty]</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation of Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>Ancient sages classified the treatment of restlessness into cases of heat and cases of cold. For those with only restlessness and no agitation, they are mostly associated with heat, but if they are only anxious without agitation, they are due to a deficiency of cold; for those with only agitation and no restlessness, they are mostly associated with cold, but if it is caused by fire evil, then it is heat. </p>
<p>Indeed, restlessness signifies inner turmoil and discomfort in the chest, indicating internal heat; agitation refers to the physical body being fidgety, desiring to be unclothed, or wanting to lie in a cool place, indicating external heat. Internal heat arises from a root cause, hence mostly associated with heat; external heat often stems from a fleeting fire, hence associated with cold. </p>
<p>When both internal and external aspects are deficient, leading to coldness in the body, sweating, slight nausea, agitation, and cold extremities, resulting in an inability to remain still, this is a fatal condition. If a heat illness lasts for seven or eight days, with a pulse that is weak and thin, difficulty in urination, accompanied by a dry, cracked mouth, a weak pulse, and a tongue that is scorched, dry, and black, this is also fatal.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Typhoid Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a patient with typhoid takes medicine, if they experience fever, restlessness, thirst, delirium, and a pulse that suddenly becomes faint and unseen, accompanied by chills and shivering, these are signs of the struggle between the yin and yang causing sweating. It is advisable to remain calm and wait, rather than panic and risk making mistakes. </p>
<p>In cases of Shaoyin disease where diarrhea does not stop, accompanied by a reversed pulse and vomiting, some suggest using pig bile as a remedy. If the pulse becomes suddenly strong, the person dies; if it continues weakly, they survive. This indicates that in Shaoyin disease, the individual has deficient kidney energy with an excess of cold evil. For those with a weak pulse, using Bai Tong Decoction to dispel cold and assist yang will regulate the pulse. </p>
<p>If diarrhea continues and the pulse becomes absent along with increased vomiting and agitation, this results from treating cold with heat, exacerbating the condition since cold becomes stronger and the medicine cannot penetrate, only increasing the shock to the body. Adding pig bile as a guide allows the medicine to enter without rejection from the cold, enabling the yang to recover and the pulse to return. However, if the pulse is merely weak, survival is likely; a sudden strong pulse often results in death. Truly, the easy emergence of the yang and its difficulty to recover is concerning! </p>
<p>In Shaoyin disease, if there are extreme cold sensations and the body is curled up, and the pulse is absent without agitation, death ensues. The absence of pulse indicates the yang has already been extinguished; lack of agitation yet remaining restless signifies that the solitary yin will soon perish. </p>
<p>If administering sweating or purging does not alleviate the illness and agitation continues, use Fuling Siwu Decoction as a rescue method. Erroneous sweating leads to the depletion of yang and exterior deficiency; erroneous purging leads to the depletion of yin and interior weakness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>When both Yin and Yang are deficient, and only the邪 (pathogenic factor) is unresolved, this results in restlessness. This decoction is used to remedy it. This condition indicates a simultaneous deficiency of both interior and exterior, and the formulation’s subtleties cannot simply be expressed in a single statement. Restlessness pertains to the heart, while agitation relates to the kidneys; hence, dried ginger and aconite are used to calm the kidneys, and poria and ginseng are introduced to soothe the heart.</p>
<p>After administering it, if sweating recurs, with a deep, weak pulse and no significant fever, a decoction of dried ginger and aconite is used for rescue. This is because the symptom of restlessness during the day prevents sleep, while at night there is tranquility, without nausea or thirst, no exterior signs, and the pulse is deep and weak, with no significant fever. This condition indicates the previous point about having recurred sweating after administering, which must have shaken the cold; the pulse is weak and fine. This occurs because both interior and exterior are deficient. Mistakenly inducing sweating depletes Yang, and mistakenly purging depletes Yin, thus it is said that both interior and exterior are deficient. </p>
<p>However, there is no need to elaborate more, as using aconite to restore Yang and ginseng to nourish Yin is already an established practice. This additionally teaches people about the subtleties of the deficiency; the evidence of loss of Yang is significantly greater than that of loss of Yin. Yang acts during the day, causing heat and restlessness disrupting sleep, typically observed during the day; Yin acts at night, bringing tranquility without vomiting or thirst, typically seen at night. Is it appropriate to treat with both aconite and ginseng, which balance Yin and Yang? It must be that dried ginger and aconite, being warm and pungent, are sufficient to restore Yang to harmonize with the predominantly deficient Yin.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescriptions from the Stone Chamber</strong> 【 Qing, Chen Shiduo】</p>
<p><strong>On the Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>After six or seven days of febrile disease, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, along with restlessness, moxibustion on the Jueyin point must be performed. If the symptoms do not improve, death may occur. This is the original text of Zhongjing. In cases where the febrile disease manifests with Yin symptoms leading to cold limbs, moxibustion on the Jueyin meridian is an unavoidable method, though it cannot compare to the efficacy of decoctions and medicines. If moxibustion on the Jueyin does not restore circulation, one can only listen to those who succumb, often referring to impoverished individuals who cannot afford ginseng and medicinal substances. However, if one uses Renfu Decoction to rescue them, there has rarely been anyone who did not recover. Today, I pass down a formula called the Returning Cold Decoction, using 120 grams of Bai Zhu, with 10 grams each of Fu Zi and Gan Jiang, to be boiled in water and taken as one dose for recovery. Whenever one observes symptoms of cold limbs and similar signs, this formula should be applied, and its miraculous effectiveness will not fail as before.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>White Atractylodes is most beneficial for the navel; when cold and yin initially enter, they start at the navel. If I assist the navel, then the kidney palace will already have vitality. Moreover, with the addition of Aconite and Dried Ginger, there will be no path unaddressed, and how can pathogens settle? Furthermore, White Atractylodes strengthens the spleen and opens the appetite, stabilizing the Central Region; are there any limbs that will not regain yang in an instant?</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage with fever and diarrhea, accompanied by counterflow and restlessness in the center, this signifies a deadly condition. The body remains hot, and pathogens are still within; now, since counterflow has started, although the body is hot, the pathogens will disperse. It is appropriate for the diarrhea to stop on its own, but if it does not stop and the heart grows increasingly restless, leading to inability to sleep, it indicates that the blood is dry and the heart has no nourishment, and that yang will scatter outward. How can one survive this? What method can ensure life? The only solution is to tonify the original yang.</p>
<p>Thus, the formula for Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoction is used: three taels each of Ginseng and White Atractylodes, one tael of fried Jujube seeds, and three qian of Ophiopogon, decocted in water to take. This formula tonifies qi; when the qi is sufficient, blood will naturally be generated. When blood is generated, restlessness can be calmed; moreover, the Jujube seeds help to soothe the spirit, and Ophiopogon benefits the lungs. Is there any remedy that does not work wonders? Even if not everyone can be saved, it should certainly rescue seven or eight out of ten!<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>

<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>In &quot;The Filial Teachings of the Confucian School,&quot; it is recorded that Gao Shao, the son of an inspector, aged eight, fell ill with fever. The physicians all misdiagnosed it as cold damage and treated him with hot medicines. He wanted to drink water, but it was forbidden, and he was not given any. Internally, the water was depleted, leading to restlessness. Both ends were obstructed, mouth and nose dry, with alternating cold and heat, and coughing occurring. His body was without sweat. There was a desire for moxibustion, but a local practitioner intervened. The practitioner admonished the mother, saying: &quot;Heavy blankets and thick quilts, a warm bed and a radiant hearth, your child can no longer withstand the heat. Is moxibustion still advisable?&quot; The mother responded that she was not aware. The practitioner prescribed a decoction of ginseng and bupleurum, administered several times, which expelled putrid yellowish substances, emitting an unusual stench. The child was thirsty and desired water; he was permitted to drink cold, icy water, consumed several cups, and subsequently expelled thirty to forty more foul discharges, alleviating the great heat. He was then given a bovine bile pill, which led to another ten expulsions, and only then did the child fully recover. In total, about fifty foul discharges occurred, causing no real distress. Iced water was consumed to a measure of approximately one he. If moxibustion were to be performed then, what would be appropriate?<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A woman in her twenties, usually strong and healthy, became troubled and exhausted in June, no longer wanting to eat. At times, she felt the urge to jump into a well. Her pulse was weak and shallow across all six positions. After two days, she felt slightly thirsty. Many believed she was suffering from heatstroke, but treatments were ineffective. After four to five days, she began to vomit and lost weight, her palms felt extremely hot, and she preferred shaded areas. Her condition gradually developed into a hidden pulse, and she occasionally spoke nonsensically. I urgently prepared a formula, the Miaoxiang Pill, about the size of a tung seed, which I had her take with well water. After half a day, the medicine helped her pass a bowel movement, but her condition did not improve. I then used musk-infused water to wash the medicine and applied it through three acupuncture points. The next day, after having her take it with cool water, she passed out a thick phlegm totaling several liters after about half a day. That night, she was able to sleep, feeling exhausted yet restful. After ten days, she recovered. This is consistent with the &quot;Jinkui&quot; which mentions that those who were once plump but are now thin suffer from phlegm. Hence, I created this medicine for treatment.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>In &quot;The Medical Cases of Xue Ji,&quot; it is said: A Confucian scholar with weak spleen and stomach and phlegm used a method to guide out phlegm, which led to severe thirst and a feeling of heat and agitation in the head. I believed the true condition was weak central qi with changing symptoms, so I used a tonifying formula called &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang,&quot; and he recovered. Afterward, when he exerted himself, he experienced heat and agitation in the head again; this was due to the qi being unable to rise. I added Manjingzi to the original formula, and he improved. Later, he became mentally fatigued and fearful of wind and cold, with cold limbs, excessive phlegm and saliva in his mouth. I believed this was a true condition of spleen qi deficiency and cold, so I prescribed a modified &quot;Liu Jun Zi&quot; decoction with roasted ginger and cinnamon, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A high official in the Guanglu government had a long-standing deficiency of the spleen and stomach. Due to overwork and diet issues, he experienced abdominal pain and chest fullness, and mistakenly took purgatives like Da Huang. This resulted in delirium and agitation, headaches, shortness of breath, profuse sweating, frequent vomiting and diarrhea, and occasional fainting. His pulse was large and chaotic; he was prescribed &quot;Liu Jun Zi&quot; with roasted ginger for four doses and stabilized. However, he still felt fatigued with low appetite, dry mouth, and a feeling of heat, and his six pulses were floating and rapid, leading to a desire for purgative herbs. I said: Occasional fever means there is no heat. A floating, large pulse indicates blood deficiency. A floating, weak pulse indicates qi deficiency. Hence, due to stomach deficiency, all five organs are weakened, and when the deficiency symptoms appear, taking tonifying herbs for the stomach leads to resolution of all symptoms.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>At the age of forty-six, Zhou was with Han Yong during the midsummer. He had excessive desires, felt overheated and thirsty, drank water constantly, had a dripping urination, constipation, phlegm and saliva pouring out, his face was red, his tongue was prickly, his lips were dry and cracked, his body felt hot all over, at times he felt like being pricked by thorns with no specific place, and the soles of his feet felt like they were burning. Applying ice only caused pain, and his pulse was flood-like and chaotic. This indicated kidney yin deficiency, with yang unanchored and manifesting externally, not heat. It was due to extreme heat, but without actual cold; this indicated a lack of water, and thus it was necessary to strongly nourish the yin.</p>
<p>I decided to prepare a pound of the modified Eight Flavor Pill with one ounce of cinnamon, boiled it with water until it reduced to six bowls, chilled it, and had him drink half within a short while. He then had warm porridge and went back to sleep until evening, after which he took another bowl of the warm medicine and slept until dawn, finally having two bowls of hot porridge; all symptoms receded.</p>
<p>The next day, he felt cold and his feet were cold up to his knees, and the symptoms returned, prompting some to think it was a case of febrile disease. I said: &quot;No, it is not that. It is extreme cold, but without actual heat; there is no fire, and the yang energy is also deficient.&quot; I urgently gave him a dose of the Eight Flavor Pill, which alleviated the symptoms slightly. After four doses, the symptoms receded again. However, he hadn’t had a bowel movement for thirteen days, so I used pig bile to induce it, and all symptoms returned. I then urgently used several doses of the Complete Vitality Decoction, which responded.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>A man had been a widower for several years, laboring hard, but began to cough up blood and experience fever and restlessness. He took a remedy of rhinoceros horn and earth yellow decoction, which caused his breath to become labored and his previous illness to worsen. He also suffered from seminal emissions and a white, turbid discharge, feeling weak and fatigued, with little appetite and thought. His pulse was strong and large, yet weak upon pressure. He then took a comprehensive tonic with added Ophiopogon, Schisandra, Corni, and Dioscorea, after which he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Records of Meaning&quot; states: Xu Guozhen suffered from a cold for six or seven days, experiencing high fever and red eyes. He asked for water, but when it was brought to him, he refused to drink. He became unusually agitated, opening windows and doors, lying on the ground, restless and unable to find peace, even asking to enter a well. A doctor, in a hurry, insisted on giving him purgative medicine. Upon examining his pulse, it was strong and large, with weak pressure. I said: &quot;This shows the need for ginseng, aconite, and dry ginger. How can you think it is a case for purging?&quot; The doctor replied: &quot;With the fever and red eyes, there is an excess of pathogen, and with such urgency, to take ginseng, aconite, and dry ginger would be disastrous.&quot;<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>I said: &quot;The yang desires to break free, externally showing false heat, internally having true cold. If we use ginger and aconite, I still fear it may not withstand the responsibility of restoring yang; how could we dare use purely yin medicines to heavily attack its yang? Observing that it does not wish to swallow water, its condition is already greatly evident. Could it not want water but still be able to tolerate large doses of rhubarb or Glauber&#39;s salt? The weather is hot and humid; there must be heavy rain, which indicates sudden sweating all over the body, making it impossible to save. Moreover, since we recognize great heat as a yang syndrome, purging will certainly lead to chest congestion, further raising concerns. Only using ginger and aconite, as it is said to nourish while also releasing, can both disperse evil and reduce heat at once—this is a stable and appropriate method; how can it be doubted? I have sat here for a long time, and if there are any mistakes, I will bear the blame. Thus, I used five qian each of aconite and dry ginger, three qian of ginseng, and two qian of licorice, decocted this and administered it cool. After taking it, there was cold shivering, teeth chattering; I covered the head with heavy cotton and the hands withdrew, unwilling to allow examination, indicating a slight manifestation of yang. I then gave one more dose of the previous medicine, and with slight sweating, the heat receded, bringing it to a stable condition.&quot;<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the blood rises, the qi falls, the heart is troubled and easily angered. When the blood falls, the qi rises, confusion reigns and joy is forgotten.<br><strong>[Note: When blood rises, the pulse and qi are full, causing heart distress.

<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>If the Yin pulse is not congested, the body feels cold, there is internal restlessness, excessive saliva, dry lips, and difficulty urinating, this indicates lung atrophy. Symptoms include cough and shortness of breath, and lung distension. The pulse is floating, there is water in the heart region, and pain under the ribs that radiates to the back. If there is a solid condition, the person will be irritable and often lean against objects; Xiao Qing Long Decoction with gypsum is the treatment for this.</p>
<p>If there is retained fluid, absence of active manifestation, no fever, a weak and slightly agitated pulse, inability to eat, and a deep slippery pulse, this indicates a disease of retained fluid.</p>
<p>In cases of a solid constitution, there will be bitterness, restlessness, and heat. When a person&#39;s pulse has been diagnosed and yet still experiences slight agitation, it suggests the illness is regarded as improved; however, if strong food is provided, the spleen and stomach are still weak and unable to digest the food, leading to mild agitation. Reducing food intake will result in recovery.</p>
<p>If the diagnosis shows accumulated heat in the heart with a knotted pulse, there may be erratic sensations in the upper and lower body, fullness and palpitations in the chest, internal heat, a red face, dry throat, heart agitation with warmth in the palms, and severe cases may result in vomiting blood and skin maladies, indicating blood stasis. This is notable in summer heat and winter severity, with a red complexion.</p>
<p>For heart ailments with fullness, slight shortness of breath, and a great deal of heat, heat rises in the heart, leading to nausea and vomiting, wild speech, sweat like pearls, cold body extremities; the pulse should be floating but is instead deep and slippery, with color expected to be red yet appearing black. This indicates that water is overcoming fire, which is a grave reversal, with a high death rate and unlikely to be treated successfully.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The root of vexation lies in a restless heart. Humans possess vital energy, which is divided into nourishing and protective functions, distinguished by yin and yang. When nourishment and protection are harmonious, then yin is balanced and yang is concealed, and the spirit is in good order. If nourishment and protection are mismanaged, causing imbalance in yin and yang, one may suffer from excessive dominance of one over the other: either yin is deficient while yang is excessive, or yang is deficient while yin is excessive. The Suwen states: if yang is deficient, there will be external cold; if yin is deficient, there will be internal heat. When yang is excessive, there will be external heat; when yin is excessive, there will be internal cold. The current condition of vexation is due to internal heat arising from yin deficiency. However, there are various presentations of vexation that must be distinguished. After grave illnesses like typhoid or cholera, or following childbirth, individuals may experience feelings of restlessness and vexation. Likewise, those with chronic exhaustion may suffer from internal heat of the heart, leading to vexation. Therefore, the treatment methods must be carefully examined.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Syndrome of Irritability due to Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>Irritability due to cold damage is often associated with the greater yang and lesser yin meridians. The greater yang meridian may also become involved due to constipation, where there are hard stools leading to irritability. Generally, when yin energy is deficient and yang energy predominates, there is heat and irritability. Hence, irritability often accompanies cold damage and wind invasions in the greater yang meridian. When yang is deficient and yin prevails, it also leads to irritability, as weakened yang is taken over by yin, thus lesser yin conditions can also present with irritability. This can be distinguished through exterior signs and pulse examination. Additionally, there are cases where those who sweat become irritable, those who have had diarrhea become irritable, and even those who have resolved illness but are still slightly irritable. This is due to the illness being newly resolved, struggling to handle food intake; reducing food will alleviate symptoms.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Restlessness and agitation arise from a disturbed and hot state, indicative of fire. When external heat is excessive, the limbs become restless; when internal heat is excessive, the mind becomes agitated, leading to cyclical madness and worries that prevent sleep. If one experiences nausea and attributes it to a cold stomach while feeling upset, that is incorrect. Thus, when the heart is troubled and pain persists, the emptiness of the abdomen generates heat, and consuming hot food alleviates this. If there is reversed qi causing agitation, it is commonly referred to as a throat issue, resulting from the decline of water and the rise of fire, similar to the movement of fire. Therefore, agitation in the heart and chest is called “zhengchong,” often referred to as heart distress, all attributable to heat.</p>
<p>For those who experience tumultuous thoughts and repeated insomnia due to internal heat and stagnant qi, or chest fullness and pain, or slight sweating with restlessness, the prescription of Zhi Zi Tang is indicated. If there is qi deficiency, add one coin of licorice; if there is nausea or initial mistakes with herbal pills, add half a tael of fresh ginger. For all who suffer from restlessness and fatigue, the cooling Ge San is excellent, and it is also beneficial to wash the hands and feet with warm water to help disperse and resolve the chest heat. Those with heart disturbance and abdominal fullness, unable to sit or lie still, should use the Zhi Zi Hou Po Tang. This applies to cases post-Yangming disease where there is restlessness and frustration. For post-sweating agitation and insomnia, Wu Ling San or Liang Ge San may be used. For dry mouth and groans, incoherence, and inability to sleep, Wu Ling San and Huang Lian Jie Du Tang should be administered. For heart distress, Liang Ge San is recommended. In cases of Shaoyang syndrome with chest discomfort without nausea, Xiao Chai Hu Tang minus half a summer, with added Bei Mu, is the prescription of choice.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Huangdi Needle Classic,&quot; in its chapter on the five disturbances, states: When the qi is disordered in the heart, it results in a troubled and silent mind, lowering the head and remaining still. It also says: The qi residing in the heart should be addressed by focusing on the lesser yin heart master point. Furthermore, it mentions that coughing and breathlessness indicate the kidney qi is in rebellion. It reiterates that for restlessness, one should focus on the foot lesser yin. Similarly, for agitation, one should focus on the foot greater yin. Zhongjing divides these into two types: restlessness and agitation. When fire enters the lungs, it leads to restlessness; when it enters the kidneys, it leads to agitation. Both involve the kidneys since the pathways connect to the lung&#39;s mother. Generally, both restlessness and agitation stem from heart fire as the ailment. The heart is the sovereign fire; when fire is excessive, metal is worn away, and water is depleted, leaving fire to exist alone, thus resulting in agitation where the lungs and kidneys converge. Additionally, the spleen is connected within the heart, and the heart channel arises from the spleen, leading to mutual conflict and the generation of damp-heat, which causes agitation.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who are troubled are restless and chaotic in heart, intensely wanting to vomit, in a state of confusion and unease; those who are agitated are hot at all times, sweating profusely, and after a short while, they cease. The classics say: “This is the state of Yin agitation.” Zhongjing notes that the red color and bitter taste of Gardenia fruit enter the heart and treat agitation; while the black color and salty taste of fermented soybeans enter the kidneys and treat restlessness, this is called the Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction, a divine remedy. If there is residual food causing agitation, the Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction shall be the remedy.</p>
<p>In the extreme state of Yin agitation, one wishes to sit in a well; Yang has already departed. If the physician still fails to understand and mistakenly attributes this to heat, and treats it with cold medicines, how can one avoid death? Moreover, when cold and cooling agents enter the abdomen, the fire throughout the body, upon receiving the water, will rise and escape. </p>
<p>Fire entering the lungs causes agitation; fire entering the kidneys causes restlessness. When both agitation and restlessness are present above, it is because the kidneys connect to the lung&#39;s mother. The discharge is as moist as oil, with persistent panting, which signifies the lungs are in distress. The nose is the external symbol of the lungs; the lung Qi connects to the nose, and if the breath from the nose is coarse and substantial, it reflects the state of the lungs.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the blood is depleted, the kidney qi governs it. When the hair is as moist as oil, fire compels the kidney water to its highest limit, indicating that water is about to be exhausted. Zhongjing noted that moist hair and wheezing signal a depletion of the lungs, which also relates to the kidneys. Since the hair is at the top of the body and belongs to the kidneys, yet the lungs are the highest of the five organs, it follows that depletion of the lungs implicates the kidneys as well. Generally, the lungs and kidneys are interconnected; if the lungs are already depleted, the kidneys’ depletion is also implied. </p>
<p>Some may say: &quot;Those who are anxious are troubled by the heart; those who are agitated are stirred by the heart. Why is anxiety linked to the lungs and agitation to the kidneys?&quot; The heart is the ruler of fire and connects with pathogenic heat, transmitting heat up and down, consuming metal and depleting water, leaving fire to persist. Thus, the lungs and kidneys combine with the heart to create anxiety and agitation. Although the anxiety relates to the lungs and the agitation to the kidneys, it is ultimately the heart fire that causes it. If one experiences anxiety and agitation due to retained food, the prescription for this is the Gardenia and Rhubarb Decoction.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a condition of internal heat, it resembles the case of those who regularly practice virtue and fast. In such people, the stomach&#39;s vital energy has long been deficient, and if this deficiency arises from overexertion, it resembles the heat caused by the Yangming condition treated with Baihu Decoction. One will definitely feel a strong heat upon touch of the body, experience restlessness and intense heat, and have a great thirst for water due to excessive labor, along with body aches. When the illness first presents, it bears a resemblance to the internal heat that arises externally; if mistakenly treated with Baihu Decoction, death is certain within ten days. This condition signifies great deficiency of spleen and stomach, with inadequate original Qi, leading to shortness of breath through the mouth and nose. After the day turns, if it is the Yangming condition at the right time, the illness will surely lessen. If it is a case of external internal heat, by evening the symptoms will become pronounced, heat will increase, thirst will be intense, and there will be constant irritability. If the exertion was insufficient, this condition will not manifest, and it is particularly prone to resolution. In case of ambiguous symptoms that are hard to diagnose, it is advisable to wait one or two days for medical treatment; errors will not occur.</p>
<p>Regarding Gardenia and Bean Decoction:</p>
<p>Restlessness pertains to Qi, while irritability pertains to blood. Qi governs the lungs, and blood governs the kidneys. Thus, gardenia is used to treat lung restlessness, and fragrant beans are used to treat kidney irritability. Restlessness and irritability may result in insomnia. For those with a deficiency of Qi and a feeling of fullness, add licorice. If there is vomiting, add fresh ginger and dried tangerine peel. For fullness in the lower abdomen combined with restlessness, use Gardenia, Magnolia Bark, and Bitter Orange Decoction.

<p>For excessive heat in the chest, one must use Gardenia fruit; if there is true heat causing agitation, Gardenia fruit should also be used. If there is deficiency heat with agitation, it is advisable to use Ginseng, Astragalus, Ophiopogon, White Poria, Bamboo leaves, and White Peony. If the pulse is forceful and rapid with true heat, Shenqi Pill should be administered.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>After profuse sweating, purging, or vomiting, if a significant amount of fluids has been lost leading to dryness in the five interior organs, one may experience vexation due to insufficient yin blood to nourish yang, causing an excess of yang energy. Thus, deficiency heat arises along with agitation, which calls for a Ginseng Decoction, removing the Su ingredient and doubling the Ginseng, combined with a half dose of Ophiopogon. If the patient is thirsty, a simple Ginseng Decoction is sufficient. If there are issues with urination, Chunze Decoction should be added. If there is heat in the heart channel causing agitation, Chen-shi Wuling Powder is appropriate. For agitation accompanied by vomiting and lack of appetite, Tangerine Peel Decoction should be used. If agitation leads to restlessness, Warm Gallbladder Decoction is required. For severe agitation and high body heat, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction is optimal. If blood deficiency causes agitation and exhibits the previously mentioned symptoms, Poria Heart Tonifying Decoction is suitable. </p>
<p>In cases where the patient exhibits chills without pain in the body or head, but feels hot and agitated, it is also termed deficiency vexation, and both internal and external treatments should be avoided, as they might lead to harm. Instead, employ a Ginseng Decoction, removing the Su ingredient and doubling the Ginseng, or add a half dose of Gypsum; if there is no improvement, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction should be administered. If additional symptoms from earlier cases are present, select from the previously mentioned remedies. For patients who are severely deficient, it is not advisable to use cooling agents exclusively; Poria Heart Tonifying Decoction should be given.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Those experiencing anxiety are often affected by the seven emotions and six desires, which lead to a deficiency of kidney water and an agitated heart fire. This may arise from residual heat after various illnesses, excessive labor causing depletion of qi and an excess of fire, or from yin deficiency triggering internal fire, resembling initial symptoms of typhus with external fever but no pain in the head or body, and a distinct pulse that is not tight or rapid. Even with yin deficiency, patients may still feel cold but not severely; the pulse can be rapid yet weak. </p>
<p>For general cases with post-illness weakness, anxiety, and a desire to vomit, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction; for lighter cases, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If there is phlegm counterflow and nausea, use Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction. For internal cold and external heat with limb pain, but the mouth not dry and feeling weak, use Yin Dan Decoction. If after taking cooling medicines the pulse becomes larger but weaker, and the heat increases with agitation and thirst, use Single Ginseng Decoction, or a Ginseng and Astragalus Decoction, or administer Wuliang Powder. For those laboring with qi deficiency, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For yin deficiency, add Bai Shao and Huang Bo to Si Wu Decoction. For weakness of the spleen and stomach, use San Bai Decoction. For palpitations with excessive phlegm, use Wen Dan Decoction. For those whose spirit is unsettled, use Zhu Sha An Shen Pill. For women postpartum with blood deficiency and agitation, add Ginseng, Light Bamboo Leaf, Ophiopogon, and Licorice to Si Wu Decoction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To express exterior deficiency, one should avoid sweating; to address internal deficiency, one should avoid purging. It is best to use harmonizing remedies for treatment. The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: for deficiency-related vexation, one must not attack aggressively; when the heat dissipates, cold will arise. If strong sweating or purging is used to treat deficiency-related vexation, it may lead to severe fluid depletion and death; if mild, it may cause internal loss of fluids accompanied by night sweats, potentially turning into consumption. In cases of cold damage with vexation without prior sweating, vomiting, or purging, there can be fullness in the chest and real heat; while in those who have already undergone sweating, vomiting, or purging, there may be chest fullness with agitation and frustration, as detailed in various categories.</p>
<p>Vexation and thirst in the heart, desire to vomit, bodily heat, and restless sleep along with fever belong to exterior heat. However, vexation may occur without ceasing, with sporadic episodes of heat that start and stop. Any vexation not alleviated by sweating, vomiting, or purging indicates the transmission of evil heat internally. If there is no chest fullness but a desire to vomit that cannot be fulfilled, it indicates depression due to deficiency, and harmonization or mild sweating should suffice. The classics say: when a patient has vexation and sweats, it is a sign of relief. If there is sudden fullness in the heart accompanied by vexation, it indicates real heat, and there may be differences in terms of vomiting or purging. The poem states: mild vexation is indicative of the supremacy of yang, suggesting that treatment should be differentiated between external and internal. Additionally, extreme vexation leading to reversal and cold extremities indicates a disturbance from yin, suggesting that extreme heat resulting in reversal, along with the predominance of yin, must be treated with the Four Reversal Principles Decoction; it is advisable to reference the section on palpitation as well.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Overview: Discussion on Disturbances of the Heart</strong></p>
<p>Disturbances that cause restlessness and heat are known to involve the heart and lungs; therefore, we use bamboo leaves, gypsum, and cinnabar to calm and descend the heat. When there is restlessness accompanied by diarrhea, it indicates heat in the upper body, and thus, we use Gardenia and Pericarpium Ziziphi Jujubae Decoction to induce vomiting. If there is restlessness with sweating that does not alleviate the condition, it suggests evil influences inside and outside the body; hence, we prescribe decoctions to clear both surfaces. A deep pulse with thirst and warm palms indicates heat not on the surface; therefore, we use the Miraculous Fragrance Pill to treat it. Warming the Gallbladder and using sour jujubes can remedy insomnia. </p>
<p>Generally, when the heart is deficient, it can lead to restlessness; deficiencies in the liver, kidneys, or spleen can also cause the heart to be restless. The classics state: the pulse of summer correlates to the heart, and when this is unbalanced, it results in restlessness. It also states: deficiencies in the liver, kidneys, and spleen can weigh the body down with restlessness, which indicates that disturbances often arise from deficiency.</p>
<p>The &quot;Living Person&quot; text suggests that deficiency-related disturbances resemble those caused by cold damage, yet they are not the same. Cheng Wujin states: cold damage can involve these disturbances, causing restlessness in the heart or the chest. These two perspectives differ. By examining the texts, Cheng Wujin’s claims indeed derive from Zhongjing and the &quot;Living Person&quot; lacks concrete evidence. However, often it&#39;s observed that disturbances arise in the absence of cold damage, thus we consider both views.</p>
<p>Deficiency disturbances may include sensations of heat in the body, dizziness and pain in the head, dryness in the mouth and throat without thirst, insomnia, all signify deficiency-related disturbances. In cases of unease when rising or lying down, and instability in sleep, they are termed disturbances. These conditions should be treated with Gardenia and Pericarpium Ziziphi Jujubae Decoction, or bamboo leaves and gypsum decoction.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Cold Damage Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When the evil heat penetrates the interior without going through sweating, vomiting, or purging, it results in vexation and heat, which appears similar to but is different from fever. The classics say: when a patient has a fever, if sweating occurs, relief follows. If there is no manifestation of heat in the diaphragm, one should merely harmonize and resolve the mild heat. If there is fullness below the heart and vexation, the distinctions between vomiting and purging should be made based on the reality or emptiness of the symptoms, thus determining the lightness or heaviness of the treatment. If vexation precedes palpitation, it indicates a substantial condition; if palpitation precedes vexation, it indicates an empty condition. An empty vexation may also present as a desire to vomit and a feeling of gloomy discomfort. Various forms of empty vexation and heat resemble Cold Damage, but notably do not experience aversion to cold, do not have headaches, and do not have body aches, which sets them apart. When the exterior is already deficient, one should not induce sweating; when the interior is not substantial, one should not induce purging. Shuhe states: empty vexation with heat should not be aggressively attacked. For kidney cold damage, where there is no heat in the interior or exterior, but the person feels vexed and does not wish to see light, sometimes accompanied by abdominal pain, the pulse is deep and thin, one can use the Four Reversal Decoction.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Disturbance causes irritation, and restlessness leads to anger; restlessness follows irritation and gradually intensifies. In cases of febrile disturbance, there are distinctions between yin and yang, deficiency and excess. When the heart is hot, there is irritation; this indicates yang excess and yin deficiency. When the kidney is hot, there is restlessness, indicating yin excess and yang deficiency. Irritation is a mild form of heat, while restlessness is an intense form. If there is an obstruction within causing irritation and restlessness, or if one is not bothered yet suddenly becomes restless and depressed, this signifies a yang excess blocking yin, desiring to lie in muddy water, yet unable to drink water.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment Principles</strong> [By Wang Kentang, Ming Dynasty]</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation of Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>Ancient sages classified the treatment of restlessness into cases of heat and cases of cold. For those with only restlessness and no agitation, they are mostly associated with heat, but if they are only anxious without agitation, they are due to a deficiency of cold; for those with only agitation and no restlessness, they are mostly associated with cold, but if it is caused by fire evil, then it is heat. </p>
<p>Indeed, restlessness signifies inner turmoil and discomfort in the chest, indicating internal heat; agitation refers to the physical body being fidgety, desiring to be unclothed, or wanting to lie in a cool place, indicating external heat. Internal heat arises from a root cause, hence mostly associated with heat; external heat often stems from a fleeting fire, hence associated with cold. </p>
<p>When both internal and external aspects are deficient, leading to coldness in the body, sweating, slight nausea, agitation, and cold extremities, resulting in an inability to remain still, this is a fatal condition. If a heat illness lasts for seven or eight days, with a pulse that is weak and thin, difficulty in urination, accompanied by a dry, cracked mouth, a weak pulse, and a tongue that is scorched, dry, and black, this is also fatal.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Typhoid Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a patient with typhoid takes medicine, if they experience fever, restlessness, thirst, delirium, and a pulse that suddenly becomes faint and unseen, accompanied by chills and shivering, these are signs of the struggle between the yin and yang causing sweating. It is advisable to remain calm and wait, rather than panic and risk making mistakes. </p>
<p>In cases of Shaoyin disease where diarrhea does not stop, accompanied by a reversed pulse and vomiting, some suggest using pig bile as a remedy. If the pulse becomes suddenly strong, the person dies; if it continues weakly, they survive. This indicates that in Shaoyin disease, the individual has deficient kidney energy with an excess of cold evil. For those with a weak pulse, using Bai Tong Decoction to dispel cold and assist yang will regulate the pulse. </p>
<p>If diarrhea continues and the pulse becomes absent along with increased vomiting and agitation, this results from treating cold with heat, exacerbating the condition since cold becomes stronger and the medicine cannot penetrate, only increasing the shock to the body. Adding pig bile as a guide allows the medicine to enter without rejection from the cold, enabling the yang to recover and the pulse to return. However, if the pulse is merely weak, survival is likely; a sudden strong pulse often results in death. Truly, the easy emergence of the yang and its difficulty to recover is concerning! </p>
<p>In Shaoyin disease, if there are extreme cold sensations and the body is curled up, and the pulse is absent without agitation, death ensues. The absence of pulse indicates the yang has already been extinguished; lack of agitation yet remaining restless signifies that the solitary yin will soon perish. </p>
<p>If administering sweating or purging does not alleviate the illness and agitation continues, use Fuling Siwu Decoction as a rescue method. Erroneous sweating leads to the depletion of yang and exterior deficiency; erroneous purging leads to the depletion of yin and interior weakness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

This is because the symptom of restlessness during the day prevents sleep, while at night there is tranquility, without nausea or thirst, no exterior signs, and the pulse is deep and weak, with no significant fever. This condition indicates the previous point about having recurred sweating after administering, which must have shaken the cold; the pulse is weak and fine. This occurs because both interior and exterior are deficient. Mistakenly inducing sweating depletes Yang, and mistakenly purging depletes Yin, thus it is said that both interior and exterior are deficient. </p>
<p>However, there is no need to elaborate more, as using aconite to restore Yang and ginseng to nourish Yin is already an established practice. This additionally teaches people about the subtleties of the deficiency; the evidence of loss of Yang is significantly greater than that of loss of Yin. Yang acts during the day, causing heat and restlessness disrupting sleep, typically observed during the day; Yin acts at night, bringing tranquility without vomiting or thirst, typically seen at night. Is it appropriate to treat with both aconite and ginseng, which balance Yin and Yang? It must be that dried ginger and aconite, being warm and pungent, are sufficient to restore Yang to harmonize with the predominantly deficient Yin.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescriptions from the Stone Chamber</strong> 【 Qing, Chen Shiduo】</p>
<p><strong>On the Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>After six or seven days of febrile disease, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, along with restlessness, moxibustion on the Jueyin point must be performed. If the symptoms do not improve, death may occur. This is the original text of Zhongjing. In cases where the febrile disease manifests with Yin symptoms leading to cold limbs, moxibustion on the Jueyin meridian is an unavoidable method, though it cannot compare to the efficacy of decoctions and medicines. If moxibustion on the Jueyin does not restore circulation, one can only listen to those who succumb, often referring to impoverished individuals who cannot afford ginseng and medicinal substances. However, if one uses Renfu Decoction to rescue them, there has rarely been anyone who did not recover. Today, I pass down a formula called the Returning Cold Decoction, using 120 grams of Bai Zhu, with 10 grams each of Fu Zi and Gan Jiang, to be boiled in water and taken as one dose for recovery. Whenever one observes symptoms of cold limbs and similar signs, this formula should be applied, and its miraculous effectiveness will not fail as before.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>White Atractylodes is most beneficial for the navel; when cold and yin initially enter, they start at the navel. If I assist the navel, then the kidney palace will already have vitality. Moreover, with the addition of Aconite and Dried Ginger, there will be no path unaddressed, and how can pathogens settle? Furthermore, White Atractylodes strengthens the spleen and opens the appetite, stabilizing the Central Region; are there any limbs that will not regain yang in an instant?</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage with fever and diarrhea, accompanied by counterflow and restlessness in the center, this signifies a deadly condition. The body remains hot, and pathogens are still within; now, since counterflow has started, although the body is hot, the pathogens will disperse. It is appropriate for the diarrhea to stop on its own, but if it does not stop and the heart grows increasingly restless, leading to inability to sleep, it indicates that the blood is dry and the heart has no nourishment, and that yang will scatter outward. How can one survive this? What method can ensure life? The only solution is to tonify the original yang.</p>
<p>Thus, the formula for Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoction is used: three taels each of Ginseng and White Atractylodes, one tael of fried Jujube seeds, and three qian of Ophiopogon, decocted in water to take. This formula tonifies qi; when the qi is sufficient, blood will naturally be generated. When blood is generated, restlessness can be calmed; moreover, the Jujube seeds help to soothe the spirit, and Ophiopogon benefits the lungs. Is there any remedy that does not work wonders? Even if not everyone can be saved, it should certainly rescue seven or eight out of ten!<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

Internally, the water was depleted, leading to restlessness. Both ends were obstructed, mouth and nose dry, with alternating cold and heat, and coughing occurring. His body was without sweat. There was a desire for moxibustion, but a local practitioner intervened. The practitioner admonished the mother, saying: &quot;Heavy blankets and thick quilts, a warm bed and a radiant hearth, your child can no longer withstand the heat. Is moxibustion still advisable?&quot; The mother responded that she was not aware. The practitioner prescribed a decoction of ginseng and bupleurum, administered several times, which expelled putrid yellowish substances, emitting an unusual stench. The child was thirsty and desired water; he was permitted to drink cold, icy water, consumed several cups, and subsequently expelled thirty to forty more foul discharges, alleviating the great heat. He was then given a bovine bile pill, which led to another ten expulsions, and only then did the child fully recover. In total, about fifty foul discharges occurred, causing no real distress. Iced water was consumed to a measure of approximately one he. If moxibustion were to be performed then, what would be appropriate?<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

At times, she felt the urge to jump into a well. Her pulse was weak and shallow across all six positions. After two days, she felt slightly thirsty. Many believed she was suffering from heatstroke, but treatments were ineffective. After four to five days, she began to vomit and lost weight, her palms felt extremely hot, and she preferred shaded areas. Her condition gradually developed into a hidden pulse, and she occasionally spoke nonsensically. I urgently prepared a formula, the Miaoxiang Pill, about the size of a tung seed, which I had her take with well water. After half a day, the medicine helped her pass a bowel movement, but her condition did not improve. I then used musk-infused water to wash the medicine and applied it through three acupuncture points. The next day, after having her take it with cool water, she passed out a thick phlegm totaling several liters after about half a day. That night, she was able to sleep, feeling exhausted yet restful. After ten days, she recovered. This is consistent with the &quot;Jinkui&quot; which mentions that those who were once plump but are now thin suffer from phlegm.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In &quot;The Medical Cases of Xue Ji,&quot; it is said: A Confucian scholar with weak spleen and stomach and phlegm used a method to guide out phlegm, which led to severe thirst and a feeling of heat and agitation in the head. I believed the true condition was weak central qi with changing symptoms, so I used a tonifying formula called &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang,&quot; and he recovered. Afterward, when he exerted himself, he experienced heat and agitation in the head again; this was due to the qi being unable to rise. I added Manjingzi to the original formula, and he improved. Later, he became mentally fatigued and fearful of wind and cold, with cold limbs, excessive phlegm and saliva in his mouth. I believed this was a true condition of spleen qi deficiency and cold, so I prescribed a modified &quot;Liu Jun Zi&quot; decoction with roasted ginger and cinnamon, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A high official in the Guanglu government had a long-standing deficiency of the spleen and stomach. Due to overwork and diet issues, he experienced abdominal pain and chest fullness, and mistakenly took purgatives like Da Huang. This resulted in delirium and agitation, headaches, shortness of breath, profuse sweating, frequent vomiting and diarrhea, and occasional fainting. His pulse was large and chaotic; he was prescribed &quot;Liu Jun Zi&quot; with roasted ginger for four doses and stabilized. However, he still felt fatigued with low appetite, dry mouth, and a feeling of heat, and his six pulses were floating and rapid, leading to a desire for purgative herbs. I said: Occasional fever means there is no heat. A floating, large pulse indicates blood deficiency. A floating, weak pulse indicates qi deficiency. Hence, due to stomach deficiency, all five organs are weakened, and when the deficiency symptoms appear, taking tonifying herbs for the stomach leads to resolution of all symptoms.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the age of forty-six, Zhou was with Han Yong during the midsummer. He had excessive desires, felt overheated and thirsty, drank water constantly, had a dripping urination, constipation, phlegm and saliva pouring out, his face was red, his tongue was prickly, his lips were dry and cracked, his body felt hot all over, at times he felt like being pricked by thorns with no specific place, and the soles of his feet felt like they were burning. Applying ice only caused pain, and his pulse was flood-like and chaotic. This indicated kidney yin deficiency, with yang unanchored and manifesting externally, not heat. It was due to extreme heat, but without actual cold; this indicated a lack of water, and thus it was necessary to strongly nourish the yin.</p>
<p>I decided to prepare a pound of the modified Eight Flavor Pill with one ounce of cinnamon, boiled it with water until it reduced to six bowls, chilled it, and had him drink half within a short while. He then had warm porridge and went back to sleep until evening, after which he took another bowl of the warm medicine and slept until dawn, finally having two bowls of hot porridge; all symptoms receded.</p>
<p>The next day, he felt cold and his feet were cold up to his knees, and the symptoms returned, prompting some to think it was a case of febrile disease. I said: &quot;No, it is not that. It is extreme cold, but without actual heat; there is no fire, and the yang energy is also deficient.&quot; I urgently gave him a dose of the Eight Flavor Pill, which alleviated the symptoms slightly. After four doses, the symptoms receded again. However, he hadn’t had a bowel movement for thirteen days, so I used pig bile to induce it, and all symptoms returned. I then urgently used several doses of the Complete Vitality Decoction, which responded.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had been a widower for several years, laboring hard, but began to cough up blood and experience fever and restlessness. He took a remedy of rhinoceros horn and earth yellow decoction, which caused his breath to become labored and his previous illness to worsen. He also suffered from seminal emissions and a white, turbid discharge, feeling weak and fatigued, with little appetite and thought. His pulse was strong and large, yet weak upon pressure. He then took a comprehensive tonic with added Ophiopogon, Schisandra, Corni, and Dioscorea, after which he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Records of Meaning&quot; states: Xu Guozhen suffered from a cold for six or seven days, experiencing high fever and red eyes. He asked for water, but when it was brought to him, he refused to drink. He became unusually agitated, opening windows and doors, lying on the ground, restless and unable to find peace, even asking to enter a well. A doctor, in a hurry, insisted on giving him purgative medicine. Upon examining his pulse, it was strong and large, with weak pressure. I said: &quot;This shows the need for ginseng, aconite, and dry ginger. How can you think it is a case for purging?&quot; The doctor replied: &quot;With the fever and red eyes, there is an excess of pathogen, and with such urgency, to take ginseng, aconite, and dry ginger would be disastrous.&quot;<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I said: &quot;The yang desires to break free, externally showing false heat, internally having true cold. If we use ginger and aconite, I still fear it may not withstand the responsibility of restoring yang; how could we dare use purely yin medicines to heavily attack its yang? Observing that it does not wish to swallow water, its condition is already greatly evident. Could it not want water but still be able to tolerate large doses of rhubarb or Glauber&#39;s salt? The weather is hot and humid; there must be heavy rain, which indicates sudden sweating all over the body, making it impossible to save. Moreover, since we recognize great heat as a yang syndrome, purging will certainly lead to chest congestion, further raising concerns. Only using ginger and aconite, as it is said to nourish while also releasing, can both disperse evil and reduce heat at once—this is a stable and appropriate method; how can it be doubted? I have sat here for a long time, and if there are any mistakes, I will bear the blame. Thus, I used five qian each of aconite and dry ginger, three qian of ginseng, and two qian of licorice, decocted this and administered it cool. After taking it, there was cold shivering, teeth chattering; I covered the head with heavy cotton and the hands withdrew, unwilling to allow examination, indicating a slight manifestation of yang. I then gave one more dose of the previous medicine, and with slight sweating, the heat receded, bringing it to a stable condition.&quot;<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>
