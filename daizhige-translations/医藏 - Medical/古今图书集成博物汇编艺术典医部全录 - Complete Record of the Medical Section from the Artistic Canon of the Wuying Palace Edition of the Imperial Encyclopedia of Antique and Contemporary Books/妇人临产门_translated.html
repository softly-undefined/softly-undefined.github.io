<p><strong>Women in Labor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: How can one know that a woman is pregnant and about to give birth? Qibo replied: When the body is ill but there are no abnormal pulses. [Note: Qi governs the creation of life, while blood is responsible for formation. A pregnant woman has the harmony of blood and qi. &quot;About to give birth&quot; refers to how the harmony of blood and qi forms the fetus, which is temporarily lodged in the abdomen without the guidance of channels. Thus, at the term of ten months, it can become exhausted and come out. One must understand that menstruation during pregnancy is blood that resides in the qi division and not in the channels. If the body is ill, menstruation does not arrive. If there are no abnormal pulses, blood and qi are in harmony.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>The Classic of Pulses (by Wang Shuhe, Jin Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>The Pulses of Pregnancy</h4>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, her pulse is superficial. If there is abdominal pain radiating to the lower back, it indicates she is about to give birth. However, an irregular pulse does not indicate illness. Moreover, if a woman is about to give birth, her pulse will be irregular; she may awaken at midnight and give birth by noon.</p>
<h3>The Thousand Gold Prescriptions (by Sun Simiao, Tang Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Discussion on Difficulties in Childbirth</h4>
<p>Though a woman in labor may be seen as unclean, during the time of pain and whether before or after childbirth, her family members should not be allowed to view her, as it may cause complications. If she has already given birth, it can harm the child. When a woman is about to give birth, it is especially important to avoid having too many people watching; only two or three individuals should be nearby. Once the labor is over, then she can inform others. If there are many people watching, it will lead to a difficult delivery. </p>
<p>For all childbirth, one should not be hasty or fearful; those around her must remain calm and composed. They should avoid causing any anxiety or distress, as worry will hinder delivery. If she experiences abdominal pain and feels heat in her eyes, it indicates that the child has not yet turned for birth. After the child is born, everyone, including the mother, should avoid asking whether it is a boy or a girl, and the mother should not be allowed to see anything unclean.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Good Practices</strong><br><strong>[Song Dynasty, Chen Ziming]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Protecting Pregnant Women</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a woman is pregnant until her due month, she should calm her mind and settle her worries, walk regularly, and avoid excessive sleeping and eating. She should refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages and consuming mixed medicines. It is advisable to first affix the birth chart, properly arrange the bedding and curtains, and prepare experienced midwives along with the necessary herbs and utensils. When labor begins, it is crucial to avoid noisy crowds and panic; only two elderly women should assist her to walk and support her while standing. If she feels a discharge of fluid and experiences severe pain in her waist and abdomen, it indicates the fetus is misaligned. The mother should lie on her back to encourage the baby to turn, with the head positioned towards the birth canal, and use medications to expedite labor. If she feels anxious, a spoonful of white honey mixed with water can be taken. If she feels hungry, a small amount of porridge should be consumed. She must not be allowed to feel excessive hunger or thirst, as it may weaken her strength. Do not administer labor-inducing medicines too early; this should be approached with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Lunar Calendar Directions</strong></p>
<p>January, March, May, July, September, and November are associated with Bing and Ren.<br>February, April, June, August, October, and December are associated with Jia and Geng.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Guide to Placing Birth Supplies and Clothing in Favorable Directions During the Month</strong></p>
<p>When arranging positions for birth supplies and clothing, one should distribute them within the sleeping chamber. According to the &quot;Tai Ping Sheng Hui Fang,&quot; when a pregnant woman first enters her confinement period, she should create a birth chart, writing the specific month and day in red ink, and hang it in an appropriate location. For example, if the month is January and it corresponds to the positions of Bing and Ren, the birthing bed and canopy should be placed in the Ren position; the clothing should be stored in the Bing position, with the chart affixed to the north wall of the birthing room. If there is a leap month, one should rely on the seasonal divisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, each month’s birth chart includes the deities: Lei Gong, Zhao Yao, Yun Gui, Tian Gou, Xuan Yuan, Da Shi, Xian Chi, Feng Long, Wu Shi, Bai Hu, Da Fu, Tian Hou, and Kuang Hu, totaling thirteen spirits, each assigned positions according to the lunar cycles. The term &quot;Yue Kong&quot; refers to the empty space in the lunar orb, and Wang Bing’s commentary states that it indicates the absence of the moon’s light, thus not counting among the thirteen spirits. </p>
<p>Now, &quot;Tai Ping Sheng Hui Fang&quot; indicates that during the six yang months, the position is at Bing and Ren, while the six yin months are placed at Jia and Geng. This is consistent with what &quot;Wai Tai&quot; mentions, where January aligns with Bing and Ren and December with Jia and Geng, and the reasoning is the same. However, &quot;Wai Tai&quot; elaborates while &quot;Sheng Hui&quot; is concise, and people today often prefer the simpler version.</p>
<p>Some say that when arranging birth supplies and clothing each month, one should orient them towards the directions of lunar merit and lunar emptiness, with all thirteen deities and spirits being adjusted according to the seasonal changes. If transitioning to the next month’s seasonal division, one should not use the chart from the previous month.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>If the 14th day of the first month is the start of spring, a pregnant woman should rest for thirteen days and not use the previous year&#39;s methods. One must follow the lunar phase for guidance. If one uses the seasonal indicators instead, the heavenly and lunar virtues will be misaligned. However, the concept of &quot;empty sky&quot; and its associated meanings are somewhat similar in this context. Some argue that &quot;sky&quot; does not pertain to the thirteen deities, as the chart includes Tian Yi, a noble position that has no peer; thus, this emptiness is considered &quot;sky.&quot; During this time, it is not suitable for anything but to prepare the birthing bed and store clothes. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jisheng Calendar&quot; states: The celestial virtue in the first month is associated with Ding, in the second month with Kun, in the third month with Ren, in the fourth month with Xin, in the fifth month with Gan, in the sixth month with Jia, in the seventh month with Gui, in the eighth month with Gen, in the ninth month with Bing, in the tenth month with Yi, in the eleventh month with Xun, and in the twelfth month with Tian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the &quot;Kanyu Calendar&quot; mentions the traveling year, the White Tiger, and the killing deities positioned one hour after the Tai Sui. For instance, if Tai Sui is in Mao, then the White Tiger is in Yin, following similarly for others. If childbirth occurs or clothes are stored when these are violated, it will bring misfortune to both mother and child. </p>
<p>Wang Ziheng states in the &quot;Discussion on Difficult Births&quot;: It posits that violating any of the deities set forth is a logical consideration. However, there are also cases of natural difficult births, where the child is born in a reverse position, or when the intestines descend, which may resume normalcy after delivery. This is not caused by illness. The dynamics of Qi and blood govern these matters; there are principles in the world that cannot be extensively questioned, and one should be aware of them.</p>
<p>Safe childbirth and the auspicious positioning of clothes among the thirteen deities indicate good and bad omens. Refer to the diagram.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Sure! Here is the translated text:</p>

<p><strong>Reversal Month</strong>: In this month, spread ashes, using either cowhide or donkey skin underneath, then spread grass on top. Do not let any foul blood soil the ground; this is auspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Month</strong>: One should not give birth in this period and should not relieve themselves in this direction; avoid it for great auspiciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Life and Death Direction</strong>: One should not give birth in this direction and should not relieve themselves, either small or large; avoiding this direction is greatly auspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Hanging Corpses Day</strong>: On this day, do not climb ropes. It is advisable to hang a horse rein and use that to climb; this is very auspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Closed Stomach Direction</strong>: During the month of giving birth and through the full moon, one should not relieve themselves in this direction or discard impure water; caution here brings good fortune.</p>

<p>(Note: The previous writings on the methods of talismans indicate that many who struggle to conceive often inquire about this topic. This book is essential and has proven effective upon repeated testing. I find the methods for protecting pregnancy to be quite sound, and the remedies for facilitating childbirth are well-founded. As for the principles behind the movements toward or away from fortune and the profound mystical applications of the talisman, do they not inherit wisdom from past sages? Surely, the esteemed Wang Taifu and others, who delve deeply into profound theories, would not err in their discussions. This book should indeed be treasured and studied, as it leaves few pregnant women unassisted when applied, so readers should not dismiss it as too trivial.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>On Difficult Childbirth</h3>
<p>Women primarily rely on blood, and when the qi is smooth, the blood harmonizes, leading to a safe delivery. However, in wealthy households, excessive comfort can cause qi stagnation, preventing the fetus from moving, or sometimes the mingling of essence and blood in the womb leads to childbirth difficulties. If the abdomen hurts intermittently, it is called &quot;playing with the fetus,&quot; and if the midwife is unaware and examines the water, it can lead to the rupture of membranes and dryness, making it difficult for the child to turn or be born. Generally, childbirth should occur when contractions are extreme and the child is pressing against the birth canal; only then is it appropriate to sit on grass. In the heat of summer, if there is an outpouring of blood, it’s important to drink clear water to resolve it. At the end of winter and the beginning of spring, warmth should be provided to the lower part of the birthing room with fire, and the clothing must be thick and warm to prevent the fetus from being chilled. Bathing the head and washing the feet in the last month may also cause childbirth difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the membranes rupture early and the blood and water dry up, resulting in labor exhaustion affecting the qi and blood, decocting Eight Treasures Decoction or Complete Nourishing Decoction with additional Motherwort and taking it occasionally can provide support. Alternatively, using several pounds of Astragalus, and around four to five pounds of Angelica and Chuanxiong, boiled in a large pot of water can fill the room with medicinal vapor to benefit the mother. The umbilical cord should be burnt with oil paper for cauterization to restore the vital energy. Midwives must be experienced and should first provide assistance while informing the patient. If labor progresses slowly, simply say it&#39;s not yet time; if it’s a twin pregnancy, indicate that the afterbirth hasn&#39;t yet been expelled. Fear can disperse the qi, making it even more difficult for the labor to be successful.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>On Difficult Labor by Guo Jizhong</strong></p>
<p>Difficult labor occurs when the fetus is not positioned correctly, causing the head to rest on blood clots, which, along with stagnant blood within the womb, obstructs the ease of delivery. As a result, the labor becomes difficult, and one should urgently administer Shengjin Powder to disperse the blood, facilitating the baby’s birth. Chen Wuze states that this often happens when the fetus has not turned properly, when the mother begins labor too early, or when excessive effort is made, resulting in the rupture of the amniotic sac and the drying up of blood and fluids. This can lead to a constricted birth canal, making the descent difficult for the baby. It is advisable to first take a labor-inducing remedy like Shen San to stabilize the blood. If there is a transverse or breech presentation, one should apply acupuncture according to established methods.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>Yangzi&#39;s Treatise on Childbirth</h3>
<p>In all matters of childbirth, one must first understand these ten principles to avoid jeopardizing the lives of both mother and child through unjust causes. In the world, those who assist in births often lack skillful hands, leading to numerous deaths. Hence, I speak from experience and pain. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is proper childbirth. A woman carries a child for ten months, with sufficient yin and yang energy. If suddenly there are intense pains in the waist and abdomen, and the fetal energy descends, leading to extreme pain in the navel and abdomen, followed by severe pain in the waist, and the water breaks and blood flows, then the child is born; this is called proper childbirth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is obstructed childbirth. A person’s life is determined by the balance of yin and yang, each having its own time that cannot be altered. If, before childbirth has progressed for a month, the woman suddenly experiences abdominal pain as if she is about to give birth but nothing happens, this is called trial labor, not proper childbirth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, if the mother has not reached the signs of proper childbirth, one should not support her by holding her waist, nor should the mother recklessly exert force. For a woman who wishes to give birth, if there is abdominal pain but the baby is not in position, the assisting midwife may advise the mother to exert herself. If the baby merely shifts slightly and the mother exerts excessive pressure, it may cause the baby to become misaligned or turned incorrectly, preventing a proper birth—all of which are results of inappropriate force applied by the midwife.</p>
<p>For any mother giving birth, one must wait until the child is correctly positioned to begin pushing at the moment of delivery; this is the appropriate time for the mother to exert herself.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>If the signs of a proper delivery have not yet appeared and one exerts effort too early, recklessly takes medicine, or causes any disturbance, it may result in the child being born prematurely. This is akin to pulling seedlings to hasten their growth, which is of no benefit and can be harmful. This is called injuring the delivery.</p>
<p>The third is called inducing labor. When a woman is about to give birth, with her waters breaking and blood flowing, she experiences severe abdominal pain, a heavy feeling in her waist, and her head is already visible at the birth canal; these are the signs of a proper delivery. If, however, the child does not arrive, it is appropriate to take medicine to induce the birth. Even if several days have passed and the mother experiences intense discomfort while the signs of a proper delivery are evident, if the child is still difficult to deliver, it is also permissible to take medicine to support the mother&#39;s vital energy and expedite the child&#39;s birth. This is called inducing labor.</p>
<p>The fourth is called obstructed delivery. In the cold winter months, if the mother&#39;s menstrual blood becomes cold and congeals, it can prevent the child from being born, which is very detrimental. A woman giving birth in winter should not remove her warm clothing from her lower body and should avoid sitting or lying in cold places. The room should be kept warm with a fire, allowing the mother to face the warmth while ensuring her lower abdomen and knees remain warm. If the blood warms up, it will flow easily, facilitating the child&#39;s birth. This is called obstructed delivery.</p>
<p>The fifth is called heated delivery. In the hot summer months, the mother needs to maintain a suitable temperature; she should not excessively seek coolness, which can damage the vital energy of the fetus. Crowding is also to be avoided, as the heat may overwhelm the mother, causing her blood to boil and leading to symptoms like fever, headache, flushed face, and disorientation, to the point where she may not recognize those around her. This is called heated delivery. Even in cool windy or rainy summer weather, one should not seek excessive coolness, as it could lead to serious illness.</p>
<p>The sixth is called transverse delivery.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>If the child&#39;s hand or arm comes out first, this is due to the mother exerting herself improperly before the appropriate time. If the child&#39;s body is not positioned correctly and there is a forceful push, it can result in the body being crossed and unable to be born. The mother should be comfortably lying on her back, and then the attendant should first push the hand, guiding it up straight so that the head aligns with the birth canal. Gradually encourage the body down, using the middle finger to massage the shoulder without constraining the umbilical cord, guiding it upwards and correcting it, or using a finger to grasp the ear for correction. The mother must be lying on her back as you guide the child upwards slowly and steadily. When the body is aligned, give her a prepared herbal decoction, and only then can she begin to push for the child to be born. This is known as transverse presentation.</p>
<p>The seventh situation is called breech presentation. When the mother lacks sufficient energy and the contractions are not strong, pushing too soon can prevent the child from turning, causing the feet to come out first. The mother should lie on her back, and the attendant should gently push the feet back in. The mother must not exert any effort whatsoever, nor should there be any panic, allowing the child to position itself naturally.</p>
<p>The eighth situation is known as oblique presentation. If the child is not properly aligned and the mother pushes, the head can get lodged against the left or right leg, making it unable to descend even if the head is visible. The mother should lie on her back, and the attendant should gently push the child upward, using their hands to align the head properly. Once the head is correctly positioned, the mother can then push to give birth.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>If the infant&#39;s head is tilted backward and only the forehead is exposed, the attending person should use a soft fabric to warm and cradle the head gently, then lightly push the infant&#39;s head to align it correctly. The mother should be instructed to exert her effort to assist in the delivery. This situation is called &quot;tilted birth.&quot;</p>
<p>The ninth situation is called &quot;obstructed birth.&quot; If the infant&#39;s body is positioned correctly, with the top of the head visible but unable to emerge, it may be due to the body twisting, causing the abdomen to compress the shoulders. In this case, the mother should lie on her back, and the attending person should gently push the infant upward while gradually guiding with the hand. Using the middle finger, apply pressure below the infant&#39;s shoulder to adjust the abdomen, ensuring the infant&#39;s body is aligned before the mother exerts her effort to deliver the child. This is referred to as &quot;obstructed birth.&quot;</p>
<p>The tenth situation is called &quot;sitting birth.&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>When a child is about to be born, if the mother is fatigued and has been sitting for a long time leaning against a mattress, obstructing the birth path, she should urgently tie a handkerchief to a high point and hold onto it with her hand, gently bending her legs and sitting down to facilitate the child&#39;s birth, without sitting on any object. This is called sitting birth.</p>
<p>The eleventh method is called &quot;coiled intestines birth.&quot; When giving birth, the mother&#39;s intestines come out first before the child, and the intestines do not retract. Mix half a cup of vinegar with half a cup of freshly drawn water and apply it to the face of the birthing mother. With each application, the intestines retract; after three applications, they should retract completely. This is an effective method.</p>
<p>Note: According to ancient methods, 49 seeds of hemp should be ground and applied to the top of the birthing mother’s head to help retract the intestines, which should then be washed off quickly. If the intestines are out, use a small amount of moistened grinding knife water, warmed slightly over a fire, and drink a decoction made with magnetite, which should help in retracting them. The magnetite must be verified for use by yin-yang practitioners. If water is applied to the mother’s face, it may frighten her, causing her energy to disperse.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>Joint bones not opening and birth doors not closing</p>
<p>It is my humble opinion that when the joint bones do not open and the birth doors do not close, it is due to the fundamental energy being weak. Before childbirth, if there is a failure to regulate and nurture, the flow of Qi and blood cannot circulate properly. For joint bones not opening, indicating deficiency of Yin Qi, use the modified Xiang Gui Decoction and the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For birth doors not closing, indicating deficiency of Qi and blood, use the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Childbirth difficulty and death of the fetus in the womb</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty in childbirth and the death of the fetus in the womb often arise from being startled too early or violating prohibitions, leading to an early loss of blood and the drying out of the fetus. One must examine the mother; if her tongue is dark blue, the fetus is dead. Therefore, in the childbirth chamber, sitting and lying must align with the directions of the four seasons and adhere to the five elements to avoid taboos for good fortune. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The death of the fetus in the womb often results from being startled too early, violating prohibitions, carrying heavy loads, or frequent probing to check for amniotic fluid, causing the membranes to rupture and blood and fluid to deplete, resulting in fetal desiccation. If the mother’s lips and tongue are dark, both mother and child are dead. If the tongue is blue or there is significant swelling and tightness, the fetus is already dead. First, take one ounce of Ping Wei San with half an ounce of wine and water, decoct it, and then add half an ounce of saltpetre, or use one ounce of saltpetre with children&#39;s urine to mix and administer, which works wonders.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>When a fetus dies in the womb due to a fever</strong></p>
<p>If a fever causes a fetus to die and cannot be expelled, taking Heishensan will allow the fetus to descend naturally. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Mr. Chen Wuze, the symptoms should first be examined in the mother. If the face is red and the tongue is blue, it indicates the child has died; if the face is blue and the tongue is red, it suggests the mother has died while the child survives; if the lips are blue and there is foaming at the mouth, it means both mother and child have died. In the case of twins, one may live while the other dies. Heishensan is thought to be too hot and should not be used lightly; in cases where one fetus is already dead, it is safer to use Pingweisan, with shibuxiao and mercury to assist in expulsion, which minimizes harm to the living fetus. Furthermore, Guo states that when the mother suffers from a fever for six to seven days, the heat severely cooks the fetus, leading to its death. The deceased child is cold and cannot be expelled on its own, but by taking Heishensan to warm the fetus, it will soon warm up and be expelled naturally.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Afterbirth Not Expelling</strong></p>
<p>Guo Jizhong said: If the afterbirth does not come down, it is because the woman is exhausted and cannot push it out. Sometimes blood may enter the sac, causing it to swell and preventing it from descending, which leads to a feeling of fullness and pain in the chest, along with rapid breathing. Quickly take the Dueling Life Pill to disperse the blood and reduce the swelling, and the afterbirth will descend by itself. The Niuxi Powder is also effective. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the intestines are coming out and there is a deficiency of qi preventing them from retracting, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, or grind one ounce of flaxseed and apply it to the top of the mother’s head. If the afterbirth does not descend, apply flaxseed to the heart of the right foot; when the afterbirth comes down, wash it immediately. If delayed, the afterbirth may remain inside. The Yi Mu Pill is also effective. </p>
<p>If the afterbirth has not descended and you wish to cut the umbilical cord, you must first tie a small object to weigh it down before cutting it; otherwise, the placenta may cause sudden death. If lochia is flowing within the sac and causes abdominal fullness and pain, take the Dueling Life Pill or the Shixiao Powder to dissolve the stagnant blood; if delayed, it may not be salvaged. If the vital energy cannot mobilize, and there is no abdominal fullness or pain, use the Bao Sheng Wu You Powder to replenish and stabilize the vital energy. Apply flaxseed flesh to the heart of the mother&#39;s right foot, and when the afterbirth descends, wash it away; if delayed, the intestines may also come out. If the intestines do not retract, use this ointment applied to the crown of the head, and the intestines will retract by themselves. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Guo also mentions that at times, after the initial descent of the fetus, the mother may be weak and unable to exert more energy, leading to a halt in the expulsion of the placenta. If cold wind acts upon her, the blood vessels may become blocked, preventing the afterbirth from descending. In such a case, take one handful of black beans, fry them until well-cooked, mix with a cup of vinegar, boil for three to five times, strain, and divide into three doses to be taken warm.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Difficulties of Labor Pulse Manual</strong></p>
<p>For women in labor, the pulse is mixed with the channels.<br>[Note: In the &quot;Nanjing&quot;: One breath with three pulses is called &quot;off-channel&quot;; this means the Yang is doubled compared to Yin. One breath with one pulse is also called &quot;off-channel&quot;; this means Yin is quadrupled compared to Yang. The note states: &quot;Channel&quot; refers to the constant state; the stomach pulse deviates from its regular measure. In healthy individuals, one breath results in two pulses, and one inhale also results in two pulses, hence it is called the pulse of harmony. Therefore, with one breath, the pulse travels three inches, and with one inhale, it travels three inches; when breathing stabilizes, the pulse travels six inches. In one day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, making the pulse travel eight hundred ten zhang, indicating one cycle, returning to the original channel once more. Now, with one breath, the pulse reaches three pulses, and with one inhale, three pulses are also noted. When breathing stabilizes, the pulse travels nine inches. Over one day and night, the total distance traveled by the pulse is one thousand two hundred fifteen zhang, more than the count of a normal pulse and not returning to the original channel, hence it is termed &quot;off-channel.&quot; If there is one breath with one pulse, the pulse travels one and a half inches; one inhale with one pulse travels one and a half inches; when breathing stabilizes, the pulse travels three inches, resulting in a total of four hundred single zhang in one day and night, referred to as one cycle; this is less than the count of a normal pulse. Thus, it cycles and repeats, also not returning to the original channel, and is likewise termed &quot;off-channel.&quot;] It is described as deep, fine, and slippery.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>&quot;Note: When a pregnant woman experiences a pulse that is deep, thin, and slippery, this is indicative of the essence of the kidneys. However, since the kidneys are associated with the fetus, this pulse is also referred to by the same name as the detached pulse. </p>
<p>If a woman feels pain at midnight, it signifies that she will give birth the following day at noon. </p>
<p>Note: If a pregnant woman feels abdominal pain at midnight, it is certain she will give birth at noon the next day. The &#39;Sacred and Beneficial Formula&#39; states that if abdominal pain occurs during the midnight hour, she is sure to deliver at noon the next day, as the hour of Zi and Wu are opposing, marking the halfway point of the day.</p>
<p>If the body feels heavy, with heat and frequent chills, and the pulse under the tongue is dark and blue, while the tongue appears cold and rolls back, the child is likely to die, and the mother should be prepared for a return to the netherworld. </p>
<p>Note: If a pregnant woman feels heavy, it indicates that her stomach energy is depleted. Additionally, if the body is warm with chills and trembling, it signifies a decline in vital energy and an excess of yin energy. If the pulse under the tongue is dark blue and the tongue is cold and rolled back, this is a sign of impending death for both mother and child.&quot;<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The face turning red and the tongue turning blue signals careful observation; the mother lives while the child surely dies. </p>
<p>(Note: If a pregnant woman has a red complexion, it shows circulation of vital energy, indicating the mother’s survival. A blue tongue suggests the cessation of the pregnancy’s pulse, indicating the fetus is dead.)</p>
<p>If both lips and mouth are blue with foam emerging, both mother and child are dead, completely forsaken.</p>
<p>(Note: When a pregnant woman’s lips and mouth are both blue, it indicates the cessation of vital energy. Furthermore, if she expels foam from her mouth, it signifies complete exhaustion of the spleen and stomach energy, indicating both mother and child are dead.)</p>
<p>If the face is blue, the tongue is blue, and foam frequently emerges, the mother is dead while the child lives, which is the true understanding. </p>
<p>If you do not believe, you can observe it firsthand; consult wise philosophers, for they do not speak in vain.</p>
<p>(Note: If both the face and tongue of a pregnant woman are blue and she expels foam, it shows the exhaustion of vital energies during labor. This indicates the child lives but the mother is dead; after the child is born, the mother will surely die. This is different from previous discussions and what is mentioned in &quot;Pulse Diagnosis,&quot; so observers should discern carefully.)<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Jisheng Fang</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty - Yan Yonghe)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Reducing a Fat Fetus</strong>  </p>
<p>After ten months of pregnancy, the body completes its development. At this point, one should begin to take medicines to reduce a fat fetus for easier delivery. In modern times, many people resort to the use of bitter orange powder. This is not without reason, but if the fetal energy is already robust, it is suitable for consumption. Moreover, both bitter orange and big belly peel can help reduce the fetus; however, if the fetal energy is inherently weak, why should it be further diminished? It is better to use the &quot;Rescue Life Powder&quot; to stabilize the fetus and nourish its energy, making the baby small and healthy for an easier birth, ensuring a more secure delivery.  </p>
<p><strong>Transverse Presentation at Birth</strong>  </p>
<p>All cases of transverse presentation are due to a failure to restrict one&#39;s diet and overindulgence in food, leading to stagnation in the five organs and disharmony in the six bowels. When the fetal energy is already robust, exerting too early or frightening the fetus can lead to complications. An urgent use of the &quot;Golden Liquid for Reducing the Fetus&quot; can help ensure the child is born smoothly.  </p>
<p><strong>Feeling Distressed Before Birth</strong>  </p>
<p>If one suddenly feels a blockage in the circulating blood and energy, losing consciousness, it is likely due to excessive exertion, leading to weak pulse dynamics, mental fatigue, a feeling of pressure in the chest, closed eyes, and stifled mouth—with a pale face and rigidity. Vitality may be at risk, and in such cases, &quot;Lifesaving Powder&quot; should be used urgently.  </p>
<p><strong>Difficulty in Delivering a Fat Fetus</strong>  </p>
<p>Why is it difficult to deliver a fat fetus? Those in wealth and nobility often despise bland foods, indulging in rich, fatty delicacies without moderation, eating to satiation before resting, which leads to thickening of the fetal sac and a firm attachment. This urgent energy during movement is because they have not prepared by taking medicines to reduce the fat fetus. Consequently, when the time for delivery arrives, it is certain to be difficult. One may take &quot;Wuyou Powder&quot; in the last month to facilitate an easier birth.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Sitting on Grass</strong></p>
<p>When one suddenly suffers from impotence while seated on grass, with eyes rolling and mouth sealed, what can be the cause? It is due to indulging in unchecked joys and anger, which leads to the exhaustion of vitality and the decline of health. The fetus becomes hard to move; sitting on grass excessively can cause abdominal pain that cannot be tolerated, leading to rolling eyes, a sealed mouth, a dark face, blue lips, and foam at the mouth. Both mother and child may perish. If the mother shows a slight flush while the child dies, one should urgently administer the Thunderbolt Life-Taking Pill for rescue.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the child dies in the womb and blood violently descends, with the womb being unable to deliver, one should take Banxia Decoction. If the fetus is dead but not expelled, one should take the San Yi Chengqi Decoction. The issue arises from wind-heat drying and constricting, causing the birth passage to not open naturally. Symptoms include a reversed pulse, a taut pulse, a red or blue face, or a change in color to five hues, with abdominal fullness, urgent pain, and difficulty breathing—indicating that the fetus is no longer moving. If the hands and feet are warm and the pulse is slippery, it indicates a difficult birth, but one should promote and smooth the labor without forcing delivery. In cases where the fetus is dead and not expelled, take the San Yi Chengqi Decoction followed by a dose of the Yiyuan Powder. After a short while, frequently use oil and paste to mix with Yiyuan Powder and take warm. If both are expelled, the mother may survive. Difficult births or retained dead fetuses occur from wind-heat drying and constricted accumulation, preventing softening; thus, labor does not occur naturally. This medicine&#39;s potency can frequently relieve the accumulation and facilitate delivery. Afterward, care should be taken to avoid warming and replenishing to prevent the resurgence of dryness and heat.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Rituals for Caring for Parents</strong><br><strong>Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng</strong></p>
<p><strong>Difficult Labor</strong></p>
<p>For women experiencing difficult labor, it is primarily due to dryness and tightness, preventing the birth passage from opening. Therefore, in the month prior to delivery, on the day of entry into the month, it is advisable to use a long flow of water to adjust and enhance the Yuan powder, taking it three times a day; the labor must be easier. After delivery, there will also be no issues of false heat or disharmony in qi and blood. If one has not entered the month, it is not suitable to take this as it may cause slippery stones to obstruct the fetus.</p>
<p><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong><br><strong>Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>Difficult labor is caused by deficiency in qi and blood. This often occurs when one does not take precautions during the months of September and October. There can also be stagnation of qi and blood preventing movement. In the month of labor, one should use wild <strong>tianma</strong> to brew a paste, and mix it with white soup. Combine thoroughly with oil and honey, adjusting with urine until perfectly blended.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Method</strong></p>

<p>If the fetus dies in the womb, the mother will have a pale face, blue nails, blue lips and tongue, and a foul mouth odor. If both cheeks are slightly red, the mother is alive but the child is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Difficult Labor</strong> (by Zhu Zhenheng, Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>Difficult labor often occurs in those who are depressed and indulged, in wealthy and pampered families, while the poor and hardworking do not experience it. The medical texts only mention a formula for thin fetuses, created for Princess Huyang, which is not the ultimate truth. Why is this? When seeing those who use this formula, their difficulties seem to resolve. My sister suffered from difficult labor; later, when she was pregnant, she experienced a setback. I felt great pity. Observing her body as plump but inactive with needles, I contemplated for days and suddenly realized: this is the opposite of Princess Huyang&#39;s case. Those who are pampered have strong qi, while exhausting their qi leads to peace, hence easy childbirth. Now, with her plump body suggesting weak qi, long sitting indicating stagnation, her qi weakens further, and the fetus cannot move due to the mother&#39;s weak qi. By nourishing the mother&#39;s qi, her body becomes healthy and labor is made easy. When she was five or six months pregnant, I applied a formula for qi supplement and a dozen patches along with the major formula Zisu, resulting in a quick delivery of a boy. Thereafter, I further adjusted this formula based on the mother&#39;s condition, color, temperament, and seasonal changes, with every adjustment yielding results. Thus, I named this formula &quot;Great Achievement Birth Powder.&quot;<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Yang Zijiang&#39;s Method for Handling Abortion</strong></p>
<p>Yang Zijiang&#39;s discussion on abortion methods contains crucial insights that must not be taken lightly. If, before the full term of ten months, there are abdominal pains that come and go or are mild, it is termed &#39;misplaced pain,&#39; and does not indicate proper labor. If abdominal pain is severe but the lower back is not, it does not indicate proper labor. If the fetus has not yet descended, it does not indicate proper labor. If there is no thrusting or bulging in the birth canal, it does not indicate proper labor. If the amniotic fluid has not broken and blood has not come out, it does not indicate proper labor. If there is bleeding but no abdominal pain, it does not indicate proper labor. In the absence of signs of proper labor, assist the woman to walk gently or support her when she cannot walk. She may sit, rest, or take one or two doses of calming medication, then stop. Be cautious not to recklessly administer labor-inducing medicines, as this may cause anxiety in the mother and diminish her resolve.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>It is essential to ensure that the mother is at ease, nurturing her body and mind, and for the midwife to first provide her with guidance. If she feels anxious and troubled, she can take a spoonful of white honey and dissolve it in newly drawn water. Care must be taken not to exert unnecessary force, as this could distress the mother. Only when the child presses against the birth canal, causing extreme pain in the lower back and a fiery sensation in the eyes, is it appropriate to exert effort and take labor-inducing medicine. </p>
<p>One man’s wife experienced severe pain in her lower back and abdomen as if she were about to give birth, with her discomfort intensifying significantly, only slightly alleviated during certain hours. This continued for over ten days without any signs of delivery. Upon reviewing this guidance, she was given pregnancy-preserving medicine with addition of ginseng and atractylodes, along with nourishing foods, leading to her stabilization and relief from pain. More than twenty days later, she finally gave birth to a son. Had she moved recklessly or used force during that time, or taken labor-inducing medicines prematurely, it would have led to grave danger.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>On the Four Methods of Difficult Delivery in Yang Zijiang&#39;s Theory</strong></p>
<p>In Yang Zijiang&#39;s ten methods of delivery, there are four categories: 横产 (Cross Delivery), 偏产 (Oblique Delivery), 碍产 (Obstructed Delivery), and 倒产 (Reversed Delivery). If one observes the situation of the mother giving birth, one must not rely on these methods unless one is a skilled and proficient practitioner, lest ignorance lead to harm. The reversed delivery refers to cases where the child is often born with its feet first, and there is no subsequent issue, as both mother and child are intact; there is no need to adhere strictly to the methods implied for head-first delivery. In obstructed delivery, the umbilical cord may be wrapped around the top of the child’s head while the child’s head itself emerges from the birth canal; a practitioner may use their hands to guide the cord down from the child’s head. If the cord is loosely wrapped once around the head, and the child along with the placenta naturally descends, there is no complication, and it is not necessary to use methods for obstructed delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Delivery Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: If the breath does not circulate, the flow is exhausted; if there is no continuity even for a moment, the foundation collapses. The circulation of qi and blood must flow continuously; a lack thereof endangers the body. If a pregnant woman has the child in her womb, the mother and child share a flow of energy, entirely relying on nourishment. After ten months, the blood and qi are full, and both form and spirit are complete; suddenly, as if waking from a dream, she can use her hands to break the amniotic sac and find a path to delivery. Once outside the sac, with mother and child separate, their breathing may differ; they cannot remain blocked internally for long, leading to stunted circulation. For a robust fetus, once the sac is broken, it naturally follows the fluid down easily, resulting in an uncomplicated delivery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The weak and troubled ones turn their heads slowly; the amniotic fluid has dried up, and foul blood obstructs the path, causing stagnation. Thus, a miscarriage occurs, and the unborn child dies in the womb, leading to the mother’s death in an instant. Should this not be feared? Whenever anticipating birth, if the amniotic fluid has already discharged and time passes without delivery, one should deliberate and plan, using medicines to expel the bad blood, ensuring the path for the child is clear to prevent difficulties in labor. How can one simply wait idly for death? Therefore, the medicines for inducing labor—such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, Motherwort, and Malva seeds—are all meant to expel the foul blood. If the lower back and abdomen do not hurt excessively, and the fluid drips down, it is known as &quot;trial fluid,&quot; not true amniotic fluid. One should maintain a calm mind and wait patiently, not hastily allowing a midwife to intervene. If the mother exerts too much force to deliver the child too early, it often leads to complications; thus, one must be cautious. If the hands or feet of the child are not positioned correctly, or the forehead is slightly exposed, one should gently adjust it by hand, waiting for it to descend naturally. Difficult labor occurs due to the mother’s indulgence prior to delivery. Not only difficult delivery but also various postnatal ailments arise from this. </p>
<p>When asked about the women described by Danxi, who find childbirth difficult after eight or nine months without restraint, the answer is that when desires stir, the vital energy and blood are depleted. The development of the fetus relies entirely on the nourishment of vital energy and blood. When vital energy and blood are deficient, the fetus weakens. After the amniotic fluid ruptures, it cannot turn and descend with the fluid, leading to difficulty in childbirth.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Cheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>In October, when the Qi is abundant and the fetus is strong, if sudden abdominal pain occurs, or perhaps only back pain, and within moments labor begins, there is no need for urging; this is the natural occurrence of childbirth. It is advisable to take a single dose of nourishing mother paste to avoid postpartum complications. If there are individuals who are weak and anxious, experiencing intermittent abdominal pain, it is referred to as playful pain; if there is a trickle of fluid, it is known as testing water. Even if there is pain in both the abdomen and the navel, while the labor is vigorous and the waist is not painful, one must not be hasty. It is crucial to refrain from pressing on the abdomen or manipulating it, and simply wait until the time is right, when the abdominal pain intensifies and the water breaks, accompanied by back pain that feels like fire in the eyes, before sitting down to deliver. One must wait for the child’s head to descend properly and approach the birth canal before exerting force to deliver. If one sits down too early or exerts excessive force, it leads to maternal exhaustion and delays, necessitating the use of labor-inducing medicine.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>All difficult births are caused by the expectant mother indulging in desires and being overly proud, leading to a lack of movement and consumption of raw, cold, and hard foods which cause stagnation. Some may have narrow pelvic bones; others may have a greatly enlarged abdomen with amniotic fluid not yet expelled; or if the presence of onlookers frightens the laboring woman, it can lead to a weakening of her spirit. When the spirit is weakened, the upper body becomes closed, and energy cannot flow downwards, causing distension and obstruction; in such cases, a sip of perilla leaf drink is most effective. For those with strong energy, use the weight-reducing sweet mixture; for those with weak energy, employ the labor-promoting decoction.</p>
<p>If abdominal pain occurs and the amniotic sac has not ruptured, one should use the ancient chuanxiong and angelica decoction to invigorate the blood. If the water sac has broken but there is only slight pain, or if there is pain without rhythmic contractions, one should take the calming fetus drink or the labor-promoting decoction to stabilize the fetal essence. One must not carelessly use strong medicines, as this could harm the water pathway and injure the fetus&#39; energy, making the labor more difficult. The mother can listen to her own needs for sleep and food, but should not overindulge in sleep or food.</p>
<p>If there is excessive amniotic fluid, the blood will become desiccated. In this case, the ancient black divine powder must be used. If there is blood deficiency, the ancient chuanxiong and angelica decoction should be administered, known as the black divine powder; if there is weak energy, the four gentlemen decoction should be given, known as the four gentlemen&#39;s black divine powder. For transverse or breech presentations, add a pinch of musk. At this point, it is like a boat sitting on sand; one must bring in water before it can be cleared.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>After taking this medicine, apply two jin of mashed scallions to the lower abdomen. Heat a dou of sand from a water&#39;s edge and place it over the scallions, gently rubbing it. If labor is slow despite the onset, it may be hindered by external wind, cold, or temperature changes. In summer, as heat causes energy to disperse and blood to boil, it is suitable to use Five Ling Powder with kuxingren. Alternatively, Three Retreats Six One Powder may be used. In winter, if there is freezing that leads to blood stagnation, the promotion of labor with Five Accumulations Powder is recommended. </p>
<p>If there is difficulty in passage and the waterway is dry, or if one has taken black Shen-tu (a type of medicine) and the effects are pronounced, use equal parts of clear oil and white honey, blended with broth from pig liver. Alternatively, take six one powder with seven qian and five qian of kuxingren, taken hot in doses of two qian each. </p>
<p>If there is prolonged difficulty in labor resulting in dry water and there is distress from evil influences, use Rabbit Brain Pill. For waist pain and anxiety, mix two qian each of ginseng and frankincense, and five fen of mercury to a powder, adjusting with egg white and diluting with ginger juice, taking it cold. </p>
<p>For transverse presentation, it is advisable to take Xiong Gui Black Shen Powder to solidify and promote blood production.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>One must wait for the child to be positioned correctly and naturally at the door before taking powdered Ejiao, Talcum, and sunflower seeds mixed with warm wine and honey. Then apply force to assist the delivery. </p>
<p>In cases of difficult labor, it is best to lie calmly on the back. The midwife should gently push the feet inward and administer the Xiong Gui Heishen powder to secure and invigorate the blood while waiting for the child to descend properly. If there is a long delay with no progress, the midwife should gently use her hands to guide the feet upwards while ensuring the head gradually moves down. Continue taking Xiong Gui and other medicines until the child turns and is in the correct position, then use the San Tui powder mixed for assistance before applying force to aid the delivery. During labor, one should take blood-tonifying medicine.</p>
<p>For a situation where the intestines emerge first, quickly soak old cloths in hot water to soften them and cover the intestines, but do not wrap them entirely. Externally apply half a cup of vinegar mixed with seven parts fresh water and wash the mother’s face with it, ensuring it is fully absorbed. Also, apply Sheng Gao on the mother’s crown, wiping the intestines immediately. Internally take nourishing herbs like Xiong, Gui, Ginseng, and Astragalus, along with Ascending Hemp and Fang Feng for support, and success is always achieved.</p>
<p>In cases of obstructed labor, it is essential to take blood-tonifying medicine.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>For lateral childbirth, it is advisable to take more of the Xiong Gui He Shen Powder. </p>
<p>If strong stimulating herbs are mistakenly used during labor, it can damage the mother&#39;s vital energy and blood. It is urgent to use calming remedies. After a period, labor will commence. Those who give birth on the first day, second to fourth days, or fifth day are all due to hurried and excessive exertion. Sometimes this is because the child wishes to be born, and when the baby&#39;s head breaks first, rot and blood may envelop it. It is recommended to use one ounce of salt and fermented soybean, wrapped in blue cloth and burned to maintain its properties, then mix one small quantity of musk into a powder and use a heated iron to add liquor to make a potion to be consumed in a cup. </p>
<p>In haste, simply using freshly drawn water to grind ink for consumption may yield unfavorable results. Alternatively, herbs like Xiong, Gui, Yi Mu Cao, and Kui Xin can all help expel stagnation and facilitate childbirth. </p>
<p>For shorter women whose pelvic bones are narrow and difficult childbirth occurs, Gui Ke Powder or Ancient Xiong Gui Decoction may be used. To treat difficult deliveries in general, Worry-Free Powder, Cai Su Powder, and Tu Nao Pills can be used.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Fetuses that die in the womb, with external signs of dark blue-black nails, bloating and inability to eat, and an extremely foul odor in the mouth, should be treated with Pingwei Powder, adding five coins of nitre, boiled in water and wine for consumption, which will cause the fetus to transform into blood and water and be expelled. For those with a tight pulse, use Dahuang Beiji Pill; alternatively, grind deer antler into powder and brew it with scallions and soybeans for consumption. For a faint pulse, use Yangzheng Dan and a thick decoction of myrrh, prepared into 120 pills. If the blood is dry or there is cold, take Siwu Decoction with Guxiang Pills. For weak qi, administer Cuisheng Wujisan with a pin of musk. </p>
<p>In cases of twins, where one is dead and one is alive, use one cup of crab claw, two liang of licorice, and ten cups of flowing water, boiled down to three cups, strain it, and then add three liang of Ejiao, dividing into two or three doses to take; this can help stabilize the living one and expel the dead one. </p>
<p>To facilitate the expulsion of a dead fetus, use Pilidang or Duoming Pill, apply Shenggao externally to the soles of the feet, and also take labor-inducing medicine; blowing Tongguan Powder into the nose will also facilitate expulsion.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p>
<h3>Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>When approaching labor, there are six vital signs, known as the &quot;deviation pulse.&quot; If the pulse is deep, fine, and slippery, it indicates impending birth; if the pulse is floating and large, it signifies difficult labor, and if cold and hot sensations are frequent, this is an ominous sign, necessitating urgent observation of the complexion. The cheeks, lips, and tongue should avoid being black or blue. A red face suggests the mother will survive, but the child will be at risk. If the fetus is in the abdomen, both the child and mother may face death.</p>
<p>The &quot;deviation&quot; occurs when the pulse does not follow the usual pattern. In a day and night, the pulse cycles continuously. However, due to the fetus&#39;s descent, the gastric pulse deviates from its normal pathway and does not restart from the original cycle, hence the term &quot;deviation.&quot; A deep, fine, and slippery pulse indicates the kidney&#39;s essence is manifesting; if the pulse is deep but feels absent, it indicates imminent delivery, whereas a floating and large pulse indicates difficulty. If the body feels heavy and hot, and cold and hot sensations occur often, these are ominous signs, requiring urgent examination of the complexion and tongue to ensure the safety of both mother and child. The face reflects the heart&#39;s essence, and the tongue reflects the heart&#39;s nourishment. A blue complexion suggests liver deficiency unable to store blood, leading to premature rupture of membranes and an inability to move or turn the fetus. A blackish hue indicates kidney water suppressing fire, resulting in both mother and child perishing. Only a red face with a blue tongue indicates that the mother&#39;s blood circulates, allowing her survival but leading to the child&#39;s demise. If a dead fetus does not exit, the mother&#39;s life is also at risk.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Insights</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin]</strong></p>

With a new brush dipped in cinnabar, at dawn before eating, sincerely chant: “Invoke the mighty spirits of the Nine Heavens to swiftly descend and bring forth life, urgently, as commanded by the law.” Write the character for “birth” quickly, then beneath it, draw a line that loops leftward, encircling the heart and envisioning the fetal essence. Let the brush push down with rapidity, as commanded by the law. Once the chant and brush incantation are complete, wait to dry, cut, and fold it into a pill, wrapped in yellow wax and coated with cinnabar, taken with strong wood fragrance decoction. If pain arises frequently, consuming milk fragrant decoction is also advisable.]</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method for Regulating Childbirth</strong></p>
<p>To ensure a smooth and easy birth, it is best to reduce the size of the fetus. A suitable drink includes a thin birth potion with a small amount of sand cardamom.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Preparation of Medicines for the Month of Admission</strong></p>
<p>In the month of admission, one should prepare the following medicines: Buddha&#39;s Hand, Baoqi, Zhike, Elm Bark, Heishen, Dasheng, and Huairui Stone Seven Powder, as well as Shenqing, Baosheng, and Lizhong Three Pills, Cuisheng and Heihu Two Elixirs, along with Cuisheng Shenfu. Additionally, prepare Kuiszi, Shengdi Huang, Qianghuo, Zhu Ru, Wumei, Male and Female Shiyan, Gan Cao, Haima, Jujube, Chenpi, Ginger, Qian Hei Dou, and White Honey. Also stock no-ash wine, child urine, sour vinegar, white rice soup, bottles, pots, and scissors for cutting the umbilical cord line. </p>
<p>Among these, Huairui Stone Powder is used for blood entering the fetal membrane, causing it to swell and preventing delivery or for lochia rising and unable to revive. Buddha&#39;s Hand Powder treats severe blood deficiency. Jiawei Xionggui Decoction is for difficulties with delivery not opening the bones. Bima Zi treats the fetal membrane unable to move up or down. Shixiao Powder addresses lochia, abdominal pain, and loss of consciousness. Wax oil mixed with talc for application at the birth canal acts as a remedy for smooth delivery. Qinghun Powder treats blood circulation issues. Pingwei Powder, (Shibu) Nitrate, and Mercury are agents for decomposing a stillborn fetus. Ba Zhen Decoction replenishes blood and alleviates energy deficiency. </p>
<p>All the above prescriptions are crucial medicines and must not be omitted. When cutting the umbilical cord, first use a thread to tie it tightly close to the abdomen, then wrap fabric and bite to cut. If the weather is windy and cold, or if the mother and child are laboring with depleted vital energy, first tie the cord and use oiled paper to burn and sever it. This is the essential method for returning life and reviving the dead. Therefore, practitioners must carefully assess the appropriateness of each method and must not blindly trust and apply them.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Method for Delivery</strong></p>
<p>At the time of impending labor, when one feels the baby moving within the abdomen, one should lie on their back. When the baby turns downward and pain begins, one may try pinching the mother&#39;s middle finger; if the middle joint or the base joint pulses, it indicates that labor is imminent.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Guidelines for Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Inducing Labor Method</strong><br>Use smoothness to promote circulation, bitterness to expel stagnation, and fragrance to open the orifices and disperse blood. For those with stagnant qi, move the qi; for those whose vessel walls are exhausted, secure the blood first.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Expelling a Stillborn</strong><br>For those with cold, use heat to stimulate; for those with heat, use cooling methods; for those who are dry, use moisture to lubricate; for those in acute danger, use toxicity to induce expulsion.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Pulse Patterns</strong><br>The pulses of women about to give birth depart from the normal pattern, presenting as deep, fine, and slippery. If pain arises at midnight, labor should occur; if pain occurs around noon, birth is imminent. These four lines are often misunderstood. According to the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; departing from normal means that the pulse is floating; abdominal pain radiating to the lower back signifies labor is approaching. However, a departure from normal does not guarantee childbirth. It also states that if the pulse is departed from at midnight, then birth occurs at midday. The term &quot;normal&quot; refers to its usual state; thus, if a pregnant woman had a deep pulse on the left indicating a male child yesterday, but today the pulse is floating, it is a departure from the usual pulse, differing from yesterday. Moreover, with abdominal pain, it is known that she is about to give birth. &quot;Tong Zhenzi&quot; refers to the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; stating that one call results in three occurrences, indicating “departing from normal” as a resolution. Li Xi and Fan further refer to &quot;Nanjing,&quot; where one call results in one occurrence, stating “departing from normal” to explain deep, fine, and slippery pulses, but both interpretations are incorrect. &quot;Nanjing&quot; mentions that two occurrences although sharing the name “departing from normal” differ in pulse and principles.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The Classic on Pulse clearly states that a floating pulse indicates a departure from the regular channels and does not reference the text of the Nan Jing. The Pulse Secrets add that besides being floating, the pulse can also be deep, fine, and slippery. This term &quot;departure from the regular&quot; essentially refers to the pulse of men and women diagnosed before, where it was said that a floating pulse largely indicates a female. If only a floating pulse is interpreted as a departure from the regular, how then can one distinguish between them? Therefore, they also include deep, fine, and slippery to represent that the departure from the regular can be a common floating pulse and is typically slippery. The Holy Compendium states that if one feels abdominal pain at midnight, childbirth will occur by noon the next day. This refers to the conflict between the hour of the Rat and the hour of the Horse, essentially indicating the time of day. The True Essentials say: pain at midnight predicts birth by noon. However, this may not be entirely accurate. It further states that if the abdominal pain does not radiate to the lower back, it indicates no birth yet. In contrast, if the abdominal pain is severe and also affects the lower back, then birth is imminent. This is due to the kidney being connected to the lower back and the uterus being associated with the kidneys. If the pulse at the wrist is turning urgent, like cutting a rope or turning a bead, then childbirth is imminent. Since childbirth can vary in difficulty and the timing of pain can be tight or loose, how can one definitively determine it by mere half days? One should rely on active methods instead.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Method for Inducing Labor</strong></p>
<p>For women who are in difficulty one or two days before delivery, simply use a modified Wuling Powder. If it has been two or three days, and the woman feels strong and can eat, then it is due to the dryness of the amniotic fluid; use a modified Siwu Decoction to supplement the body&#39;s essential fluids. If it has been two or three days, and the woman feels weak with little appetite, this indicates insufficient vital energy, preventing the movement of the fetus; use a modified Sijunzi Decoction in this case. If delivery does not occur after three, four, or five days, or if the fetus has died in utero, then use the Duoming Pill.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p>
<h3>Rescue from Miscarriage</h3>
<p>For a child born in a reverse position, one must never use needles to prick the soles of the feet or apply salt, as this will cause the child to experience pain and run about, making the mother’s life difficult to preserve.</p>
<h3>Rescue from Obstructed Labor</h3>
<p>For obstructed labor, the mother should lie on her back, and the midwife should carefully examine with a light to see where the umbilical cord is entangling the child. The midwife should gently and carefully free it, without haste.</p>
<h3>Prolapse of Intestines during Labor</h3>
<p>When labor occurs, if the mother’s intestines come out first and are exposed, with the child born afterward, and the intestines do not retract immediately, it is likely due to chronic deficiency of Qi, which cannot constrict. The blood becomes prone to flowing, and the lower source (of vitality) is not secure, hence the instability. To avoid this suffering, one should take more Dong Quai pills supplemented with Schisandra (five-flavor fruit) and cinnamon during non-pregnant periods to strengthen the vital source. When pregnant, one should take more Hu Lian pills with one tael of ginseng to tonify Qi; also, take San Bu pills to cool the blood. Caution is advised with medications that easily lead to miscarriage or weak births. At the time of entering the month, take Ba Wu Decoction with Myrobalan, Flaxseed flower, and honey-fried husk for about ten doses to help prevent this issue.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Works of Jingyue</strong> by Zhang Jiebin (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Inducing Labor</strong></p>
<p>When approaching childbirth and experiencing intense abdominal pain, there is no better medicine for inducing labor than the &quot;Tuo Hua Decoction,&quot; supplemented with a small amount of cinnamon (five to seven fen) for stability and effectiveness. If there is a deficiency of qi and strength, add two to three qian of ginseng. If the deficiency is severe, one may add it freely. Generally, if the fetus is healthy and the pregnancy lasts the full term, inducing labor is unnecessary; what is called &quot;inducing labor&quot; is merely to assist the blood and qi to facilitate the process. It is advisable to use the Tuo Hua Decoction or the &quot;Hua Tai Decoction&quot; when the time arrives, adjusting based on symptoms. If the mother has been in labor for a long time and feels exhausted, she should take the Hua Tai Decoction to boost her qi and blood, allowing the child to be born quickly. For those with weak qi and strength, making it difficult to deliver, the &quot;Du Shen Tang&quot; is essential, adjusting the amount as needed to support her strength, which is crucial for inducing labor. However, if one uses qi-moving and blood-guiding agents prematurely, thinking they are inducing labor, it is like removing the bud from a flower or pulling the seedling from the soil.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p>
<h3>On Divination and Inquiry Regarding Childbirth</h3>
<p>During pregnancy and childbirth, one should not resort to divination or inquire of deities, as those akin to shamans and prophets often deceive for profit, speaking of dangers and misfortunes. When a pregnant woman hears such things, it leads to anxiety and fear. Such worries cause the qi to become stagnant and unyielding, often resulting in difficult labor; thus, it should be avoided.</p>
<h3>On Nourishing Qi and Blood During Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Before childbirth, clear qi is necessary, and after childbirth, blood must be replenished; however, one should not be overly rigid about this. If the spleen and stomach are weak, and qi and blood are deficient, one must take steps to nourish them in advance; otherwise, there will be many troubles when labor occurs.</p>
<h3>On Miscarriage</h3>
<p>The approach to preventing miscarriage is solely to ensure that the time of childbirth is both easy and swift. The ease or difficulty stems from the abundance or deficiency of blood, not from medicinal properties aimed at inducing labor. Abundant blood provides moisture, making labor easy, whereas deficiency leads to dryness, making it difficult. Therefore, before labor, one should primarily focus on nourishing qi and blood in preparation. Formulas such as Si Wu Decoction, Miscarriage Prevention Decoction, Five Blessings Drink, Little Nourishment Decoction, and Eight Treasures Soup are essential for preventing miscarriage. Misuse of slippery or stimulating substances, or premature use of harsh herbs to purify heat and move qi when labor is not imminent, can harm the essential qi and deplete true yin, leading to severe deficiencies. If one is robust and full of qi, then formulas such as Zisu Drink, Baosheng Wuyou Powder, and Miscarriage Prevention Zhiqiao Powder can be chosen for use.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Woman at the Time of Labor</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Grind the ingredients to a fine powder and take twenty pills the size of a bulging honey ball with wine. </p>
<p>For miscarriage: When the fetal energy is near term, it is advisable to take several doses regularly to facilitate easier labor. It also treats retained placenta. The prescription includes three to five qian of angelica, three qian of cooked rehmannia, two qian each of eucommia and Chinese yam, seven fen each of chuanxiong and bitter orange, and two sheng of water. Boil to eight parts, and take warm before meals. If Qi is weak and the body is frail, add ginseng and white atractylodes as needed.</p>
<p>Another prescription for promoting labor:<br>Eight liang of donkey-hide gelatin, three liang of talc, and one sheng of plantago seeds. Grind these three ingredients, take the powder with a spoon, and consume twice daily. This medicine should only be taken in the month of delivery, as it greatly benefits the nine orifices and should not be taken beforehand.</p>
<p>To hasten childbirth, as per Shengsan of Danxi: It is effective for difficult births and hemorrhaging. Half a heaping cup of yellow hibiscus seeds should be ground into a paste. Filter with wine to remove sediment and take warm for immediate effect. If there is hemorrhaging and intense pain in labor, take three doses. Eventually, the abdominal pressure will ease, and labor will progress smoothly. It is essential to wait for signs of a proper birth before taking it. </p>
<p>A verse says: &quot;Seventy fried hibiscus seeds, finely ground and mixed with wine to assist in emergencies. If faced with difficult labor, it prevents tears from the entire family.&quot;</p>
<p>Another prescription for transverse presentation:<br>One liang each of clarified donkey-hide gelatin and talc powder, and two liang of hibiscus seeds. Combine with one and a half cups of water, boil down to one cup, filter, and divide into two doses.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>催生柞木饮子</strong><br>To promote childbirth in cases of difficult labor (whether transverse or breech) and for stillbirths causing abdominal distention, this remedy has proven effective multiple times.  </p>
<p>Take a large branch of oak about the size of a hand, one foot long, wash it thoroughly, and shred it. Use five sections of licorice, each five inches long, also shredded.  </p>
<p>Combine with three and a half liters of fresh spring water in a new ceramic bottle, sealing it tightly with three layers of paper. Boil over gentle and vigorous heat until reduced to one and a half liters, producing a fragrance. When the laboring woman feels heavy pain in her waist and wants to sit on the ground, let her take one small cup warm. She will soon feel relief in her chest and will give birth. Do not take it if she does not have heavy pain in her waist. If she feels thirsty, she may take another cup, up to three or four, until she feels heaviness below, at which point she will give birth. This remedy is the most effective.  </p>
<p><strong>乳珠丹</strong><br>Also known as &quot;Bone Opening Ointment.&quot; A potent remedy for encouraging childbirth; it also addresses fetal death within the womb.  </p>

If there is no result after a long while, take another pill. For severe cases of difficulty in childbirth, use seven lotus heart tips, two cups of water, and boil down to one cup, allow to cool, and take one pill. If after a long time there is still no result, take another pill; its effectiveness is like divine intervention. If the fetus is low but the placenta does not expel, taking this will help it come out. When preparing the medicine, it is especially effective at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, or on the seventh day of the seventh month, the third day of the third month, and also at the dawn of the New Year’s Eve.  </p>

<p>In this formula, Shao yao and rou gui aid in opening the uterus, while the other herbs support the qi. When the yang qi is strong, blood circulates, leading to childbirth. It dispels cold pathogens and alleviates accumulation, making it particularly effective in cold months, while caution is advised in hot, humid weather. In such cases, Wuling San with light boiling water should be used to clear heat and promote easy labor.</p>
<p>If the amniotic sac has ruptured, leading to difficulty in delivery, soak white honey in hot wine to help with delivery. </p>

One recipe uses equal parts of clear wine and child’s urine, adding a small amount of musk to the boiled medicine. Another method involves applying two jin of smashed green onions on the lower abdomen after taking this medicine, and then taking one dou of sand fried from rapid water’s edge, wrapping it in cloth and lightly massaging to induce labor.</strong><a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Banxia Decoction</strong><br>For treating persistent pregnancy without delivery.<br>1.5 taels of Banxia, 5 qian of Dahuang, 7.5 qian of Rougui, 30 pieces of Taoren, finely ground.<br>First, take four substances decoction one or two times, then take Banxia Decoction with three slices of ginger boiled in water.</p>

At labor, first sprinkle a pepper decoction over the lower abdomen, then place a pill in the navel, covering it with wax paper layered several times and binding it with a wide cloth. When the head emerges, quickly remove the medicine. One pill can be used three times. Another recipe uses three shelled castor seeds and four shelled croton seeds, ground with musk and applied to the navel. The saying goes: “Three seeds of castor and four of croton, chopped fine and mixed with musk.” If a woman suffers from difficult labor, apply it to the navel, two parts apart.<br>The modified Chuan Gui decoction, also known as Turtle Shell Powder, is for obstructed delivery, unable to give birth, or for women nearing death from prolonged labor.

Make sure the turtle shell is properly burned first.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Wujin San</strong> </p>
<p>This is for treating difficult childbirth and fevers, where the fetus has died in the womb, possibly due to falls, drops from heights, or early agitation during childbirth, violating taboos, or other circumstances. Sometimes, the blood may come down too early before labor, and if the lochia has ceased, it can lead to a dead fetus with a cold body and inability to emerge. The signs include a red face and a blue tongue in the mother. If the face is blue and the tongue red, the mother is dead while the child lives. If there is a blue lip with foam, both mother and child are dead. There may also be twins where one dies while the other lives, and the signs can be difficult to determine; one must observe changes at the moment.</p>

<p>For regular use to induce labor, also add half a tael of Talc Powder, 50 shredded sunflower seeds, 7-8 pieces of crushed oak leaves, and 2 inches of green onion, boiled in water to make a decoction.

<p>Medical case notes.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states: King Zai Chuan&#39;s beloved concubine was pregnant but unable to nurse. She summoned Chen Yi, who came and administered a pinch of a herb called &quot;Raw Gan&quot; mixed with wine, and then she began to lactate. Chen Yi subsequently examined her pulse and noted it was agitated. The agitation indicated residual illness, so he gave her a potion to dissolve stones, which caused her to bleed, with the blood resembling five or six beans in size.</p>
<p>The &quot;Yijian Zhi&quot; says: During the Zhenghe era, the daughter-in-law of Duke Cai Lu fell ill while pregnant. When her term came, all the imperial physicians believed it was a case of yang syndrome caused by cold, fearing it might lead to a miscarriage, and thus refrained from administering cooling medicines. Zhang Rui arrived, assessed her condition, and said, “The child is a weak fetus approaching its ten-month term. What medicine could possibly harm it?” He then prescribed the usual treatment and instructed her to double the dosage. Half a day later, she gave birth, and her illness disappeared.</p>
<p>The following day, she suffered from severe diarrhea and was unable to swallow food due to a constricted throat. The other doctors pointed out her condition and remarked that her two ailments were as contrary as fire and ice, and with the delivery so close at hand, even the gods could do nothing about it! Zhang said, “There is no need for worry. She shall be well today.” He then took several dozen pills for her to swallow, and her throat immediately opened up, stopping the diarrhea as well. </p>
<p>When a month had passed, Duke Lu raised a toast for her health, saying, “Your skill is miraculous; I would not dare presume to know. May I inquire about the medicine that cured both ailments?” Zhang responded, “This medicine is not recorded in the classics; I applied my insight to it. The remedy used before was Aconite Pill wrapped in Purple Snow. For constricted throats not opening, only extremely warming medicines are effective. Once it was swallowed, there was nothing left to impede it, as what finally reached the stomach was the potency of Aconite. That is why one dose cured both ailments.” The Duke greatly marveled at this.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>The text from &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: The wife of Hu Chan from Wu&#39;an experienced pain and difficulty in labor. She was given two taels of Liangge San, two taels of Siwu Tang, and one tael of (Shibu) Xie to be divided into two doses and taken cold. After the first dose, her condition improved significantly, and after the second, she was fully healed. On the sixth day after giving birth, she had a resurgence of blood congestion and was again treated with two taels of Liangge San, three taels of Siwu Tang, and one tael of (Shibu) Xie, all made into a single dose. This resulted in a large expulsion of dark purple water. The woman remains healthy and robust to this day. The Daijun people often say: For a pregnant woman experiencing illness, during the ninth and tenth months, (Shibu) Xie is permissible. In the eighth month, it should be avoided, but there is no harm in the seventh month, which is considered the Yang month. By the tenth month, the fetus is already formed.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>A woman who was over twenty years old and in labor called for three midwives. Two of the midwives held her arms tightly, while one held her head against her belly and pulled her waist with both hands, exerting all their strength.

Why must it be forced in this way? </p>
<p>As a result, the woman experienced a blockage of her meridians, her abdomen felt as if it had been carved by a knife, she had an unquenchable thirst, and her urination was obstructed.

She could not eat or drink and was in a state of despair about death. </p>
<p>A physician first let her drink ice-cold water freely, about two liters, which alleviated her pain and quenched her thirst. Next, he administered pills and formulas to open the meridians, giving her five or six doses, which resulted in many bowel movements and improved her appetite significantly. He continued to adjust her treatment with Gui Ling Gan Lu powder, Liu Yi powder, and Chai Hu decoction, and after half a month, she was able to find relief.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>A woman was in labor and called several village midwives to attend her. When a hand of the child emerged first, the midwives, not understanding the situation, pulled on it, causing the arm to break, and the child died in the womb. The mother turned pale and became cold, sweating profusely and faintly gasping; the family resigned themselves to her death. Suddenly, someone said: &quot;Zhang Dai has a unique insight; let’s ask him!&quot; Dai said: &quot;Her life hangs by a thread; needles and medicine cannot help.&quot; Urgently, they took a balance hook and attached a strong rope to it, coating the hook with ointment. They had the mother recline with her legs spread out, and with one person standing on each of her feet, they used the hook to grasp the dead fetus. They instructed a strong woman to pull it out, and a large amount of stagnant blood, about five to seven liters, flowed out. The mother became faint and unresponsive. After a while, they gave her cold water to drink; she gradually swallowed a couple of mouthfuls and awoke significantly. She ate food, and the next day, they gave her a four-ingredient soup to replenish her blood, and it took several days for her to recover. Dai often said: &quot;After childbirth, there should be no other matters; the care of the wrong midwives can turn to harm.&quot;<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Chen Liangfu treated a pregnant woman who was seven months along. Upon returning from a distance, she suddenly felt pain in her heart from the fetus pressing upward, causing her to be restless in sitting and lying down. Two doctors treated her without success and concluded that the fetus had died. They used the seeds of Gleditsia, ground and mixed with musk, to apply to her navel and foretold her imminent death. </p>
<p>Chen was summoned for a diagnosis and found her pulse at the two wrist positions was absent while other pulses were steady. He asked the two doctors what evidence they had for their treatment. They replied: &quot;Dead fetus.&quot; Chen asked how they knew that, to which they responded: &quot;The two wrist pulses are deep and absent; this indicates it.&quot; Chen then said: &quot;From which classic is this reasoning derived?&quot; The two doctors had no answer. Chen stated: &quot;This child is suspended. If the fetus were dead, there would be distinguishing signs: a red face with a blue tongue indicates a dead fetus and a living mother; a blue face with a red tongue and drooling indicates a living fetus and a dead mother; both blue lips and mouth indicate both mother and child are dead. Now, her face is not red, and her mouth is not blue, thus the child is not dead; it is the fetus pressing against the heart. It is appropriate to treat her with a drink of perilla leaf.&quot; After ten doses, the fetus was expelled.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>&quot;The Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: A pregnant woman experienced abdominal distension, difficult urination, and vomiting. Various physicians administered warming and gas-relieving medicines, but she only vomited more and her distension worsened, causing an extreme feeling of fullness and discomfort in her chest. Upon examination, it was discovered that the fetus had been dead for a long time, and the medicine for expelling a dead fetus could not take effect. Eventually, she was given carp soup. The commentary states: When a pregnant woman experiences swelling all over her body, or intense pressure and swelling in the chest and abdomen, it is termed &#39;fetal water.&#39; Therefore, they looked closely at the woman&#39;s chest and abdomen, which were indistinct, and urgently administered three to five doses of carp soup. Both her bowel movements and urination expelled foul water, and the swelling subsided, allowing her to give birth to the dead fetus. This condition often arises because the abdominal swelling from pregnancy is not recognized, and everyone assumes that this is normal for pregnancy, unaware of the dangers of &#39;fetal water.&#39;<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>A pregnant woman, five months along, took the Red Pill and had a miscarriage. Following that, she experienced abdominal swelling and pain, and took a remedy to break the blood, which only intensified the pain, making her afraid to touch her abdomen. I said: &quot;This potent medicine severely harms the spleen and stomach.&quot; I prescribed two doses of Eight Treasures, doubling the ginseng, astragalus, pinellia, frankincense, and myrrh, and the pain stopped; after several doses, she felt at ease.</p>
<p>In the winter of the next year, a woman from Jing had a difficult childbirth that exhausted her vital energy. The child was already dead at birth. Using oiled paper to burn and cut the umbilical cord, I applied its warmth, and soon after, the child made a sound. This child later showed no signs of being harmed or having loose stools from feeding, demonstrating the effectiveness of the previous method. In the world, using knives to cut the umbilical cord can endanger both mother and child, yet people remain unaware of the cause. Moreover, midwives often give small benefits regularly and earn the trust of mothers, providing them comfort, so there are fewer worries.</p>
<p>One midwife said: &quot;I only had one girl whom I was assisting during childbirth, but while I was out checking on the street patrol, she was startled and died before delivering. Later, when I saw the patrol, I was sternly reprimanded. Upon returning, I found the mother; though the baby was positioned correctly, the head was tilted to one side, causing a difficult delivery. Due to fear of the patrol, I didn&#39;t dare to intervene, resulting in both mother and child being unable to be saved.&quot;<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>The official Li Mengqing married a woman aged thirty-five as his secondary wife. She became pregnant and, fearing that her chicken would lay eggs, requested a decoction of flavored Guo Xiong (Gui Xiong) soup in four doses as a remedy. Ultimately, the birth canal did not open, but after taking just one dose, she suddenly gave birth.</p>
<p>In the case of Fei Huaide&#39;s wife, the birth canal also did not open, and she had not given birth for two days. After taking ten doses of the previously mentioned medicine, she delivered promptly. Huaide transmitted the use of this prescription, and no one who has used it has failed.</p>
<p>A woman faced the greatest difficulty in labor, and after forty pregnancies, she experienced excessive bleeding, with her birth canal not opening. After taking one dose of the previous decoction, she also drank a decoction of Wu You San to assist with her blood and aid in delivery.</p>
<p>The daughter of a midwife worked hard and carried heavy loads during her pregnancy, suffering from cold heaviness in her abdomen and foul breath. I suspected her fetus was already dead, so I instructed her to examine her tongue, which appeared dark blue. I then administered half a tael of (Shi Bu) xia and it cleared away the foul fluids, ensuring her safety.</p>
<p>A woman experienced fetal death and took (Shi Bu) xia to expel the foul fluids. She felt weak, and her breath was faint. I used the Si Junzi as the primary medicine, complemented with Si Wu, ginger, and cinnamon, and she recovered.</p>
<p>One woman failed to expel the placenta, suffering from swelling and pain in her chest and abdomen, feeling so uneasy that she did not dare approach it. I instructed her to take a dose of rolling wine mixed with Shi Xiao San, and both the lochia and placenta were expelled.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>A woman in childbirth had not expelled the afterbirth, and experienced abdominal pain. When pressure was applied, the pain slightly eased; this was due to qi deficiency which prevented the expulsion. Therefore, she was administered Wuyou San to facilitate the process. In similar cases, midwives often suggested taking Yimucao pills; occasionally, placing the mother’s hair in her mouth induced vomiting, causing the afterbirth to emerge. If the afterbirth does not come out, death is certain. The aforementioned method proved very effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A patient, suffering from asthma and unable to lie down, was treated by many for lung qi affected by wind. Lü Cangzhou diagnosed the condition, finding the pulse at the cun position to be twice as strong as normal, with a rapid, wiry pulse at jueyin, and both pulses short and deviating from their normal path. He explained that the illness stemmed from toxic medicine stirring the blood, leading to fetal death and failure to descend; this was not a case of wind or cold causing asthma. Thus, he prescribed a labor-inducing decoction with additions of Chuanxiong and Angelica, to be taken in two to three liters. At midnight, a dead fetus was indeed expelled, and the asthma ceased. Ha San closely instructed that the patient, in truth, had a pregnancy distress from jealousy by her husband, hence the medicine was implicated; of this, many were unaware and felt ashamed when they departed.</p>
<p>A woman had been in labor for seven days with no delivery despite numerous treatments. Pang Anchang examined her and instructed her family to warm her lower back and abdomen with soup and to gently massage her. The pregnant woman felt slight pain in her intestines and moaned, and eventually gave birth to a boy, causing great surprise without understanding why. Pang said: &quot;The child has already entered the womb, but a hand mistakenly held the mother&#39;s intestines, preventing detachment. It was not something medicine could remedy. I felt for the child&#39;s hand through the abdomen, and pricked the tiger&#39;s mouth; the pain made the hand retract, resulting in a quick birth without other techniques.&quot; Upon examining the child, traces of needles remained at the right hand&#39;s tiger&#39;s mouth.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>A woman was in labor for several days without delivering and the labor-inducing medicine was ineffective. Pang Anchang said: &quot;This must be because she sat down too early, her heart is filled with fear, causing her energy to be blocked and unable to move. This is not due to disobedience.&quot; The Suwen states: &quot;Fear causes energy to descend.&quot; When fear arises, the spirit becomes timid; when timid, the upper cavity closes; when closed, energy reverses; when reversed, the lower cavity becomes congested, and thus energy cannot flow. A dose of perilla tea resulted in immediate delivery. Additionally, he treated a woman with a suspended fetus.</p>
<p>A woman endured a difficult labor for seven days without producing milk and ate very little. Hua Borin examined her, gave her a bowl of cold porridge, crushed maple leaves, boiled the broth and mixed it for her to drink, which resulted in her milk coming in. When asked about the reasoning, Hua said: &quot;This woman has eaten very little; there has never been a case of childbirth without energy from grain. The maple leaves fall first and then reappear, hence we make tea from them.&quot;</p>
<p>A woman had a difficult labor for three days without delivering, and the medicines to break the blood and regulate menstruation all proved ineffective. Wu Jiaoshan then devised a prescription, using plantain seeds as the main ingredient, with winter melon seeds as the assistant, and white atractylodes and bitter orange peels as aides, which resulted in delivery by noon, surprising all the other physicians. Wu said: &quot;The Materia Medica states that this is the main ingredient for inducing labor. The annotations on the Book of Songs say to gather barnyard millet to prevent difficulty in childbirth.&quot;<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>A lady in a mansion faced difficulties during childbirth and had already lost consciousness. Liu Fuzhen ordered red flower to be boiled strongly, propping the lady upon a stool. He used a silk cloth to soak in the broth and poured it over her, along with warming water. After a long duration, she regained her senses and subsequently gave birth to a boy. Indeed, encountering severe winter when the blood is cold causes stagnation, and warmth induces childbirth—most remarkable!</p>
<p>At an inn, a physician found a woman who had been in labor for several days without progress. Her lower body had grown cold, and they were out of medicine and in a dire situation. They boiled a decoction of pepper, orange, and evodia to wash the lower abdomen and enhance the circulation of qi and blood, which led to childbirth.</p>
<p>A woman nearing her due date suddenly lost her vision, unable to see the lamps. She suffered from headaches and dizziness, her neck and cheeks swollen, unable to turn her head. Despite treatment efforts, her condition worsened. By chance, she took a wind-dispelling powder, which alleviated her ailments, allowing her to give birth safely. However, her eyesight remained impaired, making it difficult to recognize people. Eventually, she took a herbal remedy with four essential ingredients, adding schizonepeta and windbreak, and also consumed a tonic for the eyes, gradually improving her eyesight. It was strongly advised against the consumption of wine, wheat, fried foods, chicken, lamb, goose, duck, tofu, and spicy hot foods, as well as physical intimacy. This condition arose due to the heat generated during pregnancy, caused by excessive warmth in clothing, or by overindulgence in wine and fried foods, resulting in increased heat affecting the fetus.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>A woman who was four months pregnant had a miscarriage. More than ten days later, her abdomen swelled, she had a fever, felt breathless, and her pulse was strong. Her face was red, and her mouth, nose, and tongue had a blue-black hue. Chen Dougan diagnosed her, stating that a strong pulse indicated that the fetus had not yet been expelled, and the redness of the face signified excessive heart fire and dry blood. The blue tongue and the black mouth and nose indicated that the liver had already decayed and the fetus had died. Everyone inside and outside said that the fetus had long since been expelled. He rediagnosed her, and with the color and pulse unchanged, he prepared a decoction of snake skin with Pingwei Powder, adding twice the amount of Glauber&#39;s salt and Angelica tail, and she took it. Soon, her abdomen rumbled like thunder, and she experienced cramps in her waist and abdomen, resulting in the expulsion of the dead fetus, after which her illness was quickly resolved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Records of Inheritance&quot; states: While the master was in Yuyang, he encountered a maidservant from the county magistrate of Yuncheng, who was near her term and suffering from a crooked mouth and eyes, a bent back, and hands and feet that were stiff and contorted, leaving her in a state of unconsciousness. She requested treatment from the master, who used a detoxifying soup with Coptis chinensis, adding powdered cinnabar, which was administered to open her mouth and allow for feeding. There was some stabilization, and that night she gave birth to a boy. After delivery, she remained especially dazed and unresponsive, and with a seven-treasure decoction, she was soon at ease.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　欲产之妇脉离经，沉细而滑也同名。夜半觉痛应分诞，来日日午定知生。此四句往往误解。按《脉经》曰：离经，其脉浮，腹痛引腰脊，为欲生也。但离经者不产也。又云：其脉离经夜半觉，日中则生也。经者常也，谓离其常处为离经，假如孕妇昨日见左沉实为男之脉，今日或脉浮，是离其寻常之脉，而异于昨日，又且腹痛，知是将诞也。通真子引《难经》一呼三至曰离经为解，李晞范又引《难经》一呼一至曰离经，以解沉细而滑，皆非也。《难经》言损至二至虽同名离经，其脉与理则不同。<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>且《脉经》明言离经其脉浮也，不曾引援《难经》之文。合《脉诀》因其言脉浮，又添沉细而滑，同名离经，盖以前所诊男女脉，或云浮大为女，若只脉浮为离经，若平常见浮大为女之脉，安辨离经？故又增沉细而滑，以见离为浮大之常经，为常滑也。《圣惠方》云：夜半子时觉腹痛，来日午时必定生产。谓子午相冲，正半日时数也。通真子曰：夜半痛，日午生。此言恐未为的。又曰：腹痛而腰不痛，未产也。若腹痛连腰痛甚者，即产。所以然者，肾系于腰，胞系于肾故也。诊其尺脉转急，如切绳转珠者，即产也。生产有难易，痛来有紧慢，安可定以半日？当以活法。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>　　　　妇人秘科 【明　万全】</p>

<p>　　胎前清气，产后补血，此亦不可拘泥。若脾胃不健，气血不充，必当预为调补，不然，临产必多患难。<br>　　　　　论滑胎</p>
<p>　　妊娠滑胎之法，惟欲其生产之期，易而且速。而难易之由，则在血之盈虚，不在药之滑利。盖血多则润而产必易，血亏则濇而产必难。故于未产之前，但宜以培养气血为主，而预为之地。如四物汤、滑胎煎、五福饮、小营煎、八珍汤之类。即皆滑胎之要药。若不知此而过用滑利等物；或产期未近无火无滞，而妄用清火行气沉降苦寒等药，必能暗残营气，走泄真阴，多致血亏气陷，反为临期大害。若果肥盛气实者，则紫苏饮、保生无忧散、滑胎枳壳散之类，皆可择用。古今图书集成医部全录卷三百八十九<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p>

<p><strong>Discussion on the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: How can one know that a woman is pregnant and about to give birth? Qibo replied: When the body is ill but there are no abnormal pulses. [Note: Qi governs the creation of life, while blood is responsible for formation. A pregnant woman has the harmony of blood and qi. &quot;About to give birth&quot; refers to how the harmony of blood and qi forms the fetus, which is temporarily lodged in the abdomen without the guidance of channels. Thus, at the term of ten months, it can become exhausted and come out. One must understand that menstruation during pregnancy is blood that resides in the qi division and not in the channels. If the body is ill, menstruation does not arrive. If there are no abnormal pulses, blood and qi are in harmony.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Classic of Pulses (by Wang Shuhe, Jin Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>The Pulses of Pregnancy</h4>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, her pulse is superficial. If there is abdominal pain radiating to the lower back, it indicates she is about to give birth. However, an irregular pulse does not indicate illness. Moreover, if a woman is about to give birth, her pulse will be irregular; she may awaken at midnight and give birth by noon.</p>
<h3>The Thousand Gold Prescriptions (by Sun Simiao, Tang Dynasty)</h3>
<h4>Discussion on Difficulties in Childbirth</h4>
<p>Though a woman in labor may be seen as unclean, during the time of pain and whether before or after childbirth, her family members should not be allowed to view her, as it may cause complications. If she has already given birth, it can harm the child. When a woman is about to give birth, it is especially important to avoid having too many people watching; only two or three individuals should be nearby. Once the labor is over, then she can inform others. If there are many people watching, it will lead to a difficult delivery. </p>
<p>For all childbirth, one should not be hasty or fearful; those around her must remain calm and composed. They should avoid causing any anxiety or distress, as worry will hinder delivery. If she experiences abdominal pain and feels heat in her eyes, it indicates that the child has not yet turned for birth. After the child is born, everyone, including the mother, should avoid asking whether it is a boy or a girl, and the mother should not be allowed to see anything unclean.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Protecting Pregnant Women</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a woman is pregnant until her due month, she should calm her mind and settle her worries, walk regularly, and avoid excessive sleeping and eating. She should refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages and consuming mixed medicines. It is advisable to first affix the birth chart, properly arrange the bedding and curtains, and prepare experienced midwives along with the necessary herbs and utensils. When labor begins, it is crucial to avoid noisy crowds and panic; only two elderly women should assist her to walk and support her while standing. If she feels a discharge of fluid and experiences severe pain in her waist and abdomen, it indicates the fetus is misaligned. The mother should lie on her back to encourage the baby to turn, with the head positioned towards the birth canal, and use medications to expedite labor. If she feels anxious, a spoonful of white honey mixed with water can be taken. If she feels hungry, a small amount of porridge should be consumed. She must not be allowed to feel excessive hunger or thirst, as it may weaken her strength. Do not administer labor-inducing medicines too early; this should be approached with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Lunar Calendar Directions</strong></p>
<p>January, March, May, July, September, and November are associated with Bing and Ren.<br>February, April, June, August, October, and December are associated with Jia and Geng.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　凡安产藏衣方位，并于卧阁内分布。《太平圣惠方》云，凡妊妇初入月，便写产图一本，以朱书某月某日，空贴在某位。如正月在丙壬，可于壬位安产妇床帐；丙位藏衣之类，贴产房北壁。若值闰月，只看节气用之。又云：每月产图，有雷公、招摇、运鬼力士、天狗、轩辕、大时、咸池、丰隆、吴时、白虎、大夫、天侯、狂虎，凡此十三神，并从月建易其位。所谓月空者，按《内经》云：月廓空无写。王冰注云：论月轮中空日也。即非十三神之数。今《太平圣惠方》以六阳月在丙壬，以六阴月在甲庚，正如《外台》所言：正月在丙壬，至十二月在甲庚之类，其理一也。但《外台》言之详，《圣惠》言之简，今人多从其简。或云：凡逐月安产藏衣，并向月德、月空方位，所有十三神煞，并从节气更换。若交次月节，便作次月用书产图者非也。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guide to Placing Birth Supplies and Clothing in Favorable Directions During the Month</strong></p>
<p>When arranging positions for birth supplies and clothing, one should distribute them within the sleeping chamber. According to the &quot;Tai Ping Sheng Hui Fang,&quot; when a pregnant woman first enters her confinement period, she should create a birth chart, writing the specific month and day in red ink, and hang it in an appropriate location. For example, if the month is January and it corresponds to the positions of Bing and Ren, the birthing bed and canopy should be placed in the Ren position; the clothing should be stored in the Bing position, with the chart affixed to the north wall of the birthing room. If there is a leap month, one should rely on the seasonal divisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, each month’s birth chart includes the deities: Lei Gong, Zhao Yao, Yun Gui, Tian Gou, Xuan Yuan, Da Shi, Xian Chi, Feng Long, Wu Shi, Bai Hu, Da Fu, Tian Hou, and Kuang Hu, totaling thirteen spirits, each assigned positions according to the lunar cycles. The term &quot;Yue Kong&quot; refers to the empty space in the lunar orb, and Wang Bing’s commentary states that it indicates the absence of the moon’s light, thus not counting among the thirteen spirits. </p>
<p>Now, &quot;Tai Ping Sheng Hui Fang&quot; indicates that during the six yang months, the position is at Bing and Ren, while the six yin months are placed at Jia and Geng. This is consistent with what &quot;Wai Tai&quot; mentions, where January aligns with Bing and Ren and December with Jia and Geng, and the reasoning is the same. However, &quot;Wai Tai&quot; elaborates while &quot;Sheng Hui&quot; is concise, and people today often prefer the simpler version.</p>
<p>Some say that when arranging birth supplies and clothing each month, one should orient them towards the directions of lunar merit and lunar emptiness, with all thirteen deities and spirits being adjusted according to the seasonal changes. If transitioning to the next month’s seasonal division, one should not use the chart from the previous month.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>假如正月十四日立春，若妊妇十三旦乳卧，岂可作去年十二月用？必依月分用之乃是。若依节气使换，则天德、月德所在差矣。然月空与任谓之中天空颇相类。议者以为天空者，非十三神之数。盖课中有天乙，贵人其位无可与对者，故此空是谓天空。值此神百事不宜，止宜安产妇床帐藏衣之类耳。《集圣历》云：天德正月在丁，二月在坤，三月在壬，四月在辛，五月在干，六月在甲，七月在癸，八月在艮，九月在丙，十月在乙，十一月在巽，十二月在天。　　又《堪舆历》有游年、白虎、杀神在太岁后一辰。如太岁卯，则白虎在寅，余仿此推之。若产及藏衣犯之，则子母皆不利。　　 【王子亨云：《难产逆生论》称犯一切神杀固有是理。然亦有自然难产，儿自逆生者，及产肠俱下者，产已则复如故。此非疾病所致。气血所主，天下之理，盖有不可穷诘者，亦宜知之。】　　　　　　　安产藏衣十三神吉凶方位　　见图<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the 14th day of the first month is the start of spring, a pregnant woman should rest for thirteen days and not use the previous year&#39;s methods. One must follow the lunar phase for guidance. If one uses the seasonal indicators instead, the heavenly and lunar virtues will be misaligned. However, the concept of &quot;empty sky&quot; and its associated meanings are somewhat similar in this context. Some argue that &quot;sky&quot; does not pertain to the thirteen deities, as the chart includes Tian Yi, a noble position that has no peer; thus, this emptiness is considered &quot;sky.&quot; During this time, it is not suitable for anything but to prepare the birthing bed and store clothes. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jisheng Calendar&quot; states: The celestial virtue in the first month is associated with Ding, in the second month with Kun, in the third month with Ren, in the fourth month with Xin, in the fifth month with Gan, in the sixth month with Jia, in the seventh month with Gui, in the eighth month with Gen, in the ninth month with Bing, in the tenth month with Yi, in the eleventh month with Xun, and in the twelfth month with Tian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the &quot;Kanyu Calendar&quot; mentions the traveling year, the White Tiger, and the killing deities positioned one hour after the Tai Sui. For instance, if Tai Sui is in Mao, then the White Tiger is in Yin, following similarly for others. If childbirth occurs or clothes are stored when these are violated, it will bring misfortune to both mother and child. </p>
<p>Wang Ziheng states in the &quot;Discussion on Difficult Births&quot;: It posits that violating any of the deities set forth is a logical consideration. However, there are also cases of natural difficult births, where the child is born in a reverse position, or when the intestines descend, which may resume normalcy after delivery. This is not caused by illness. The dynamics of Qi and blood govern these matters; there are principles in the world that cannot be extensively questioned, and one should be aware of them.</p>
<p>Safe childbirth and the auspicious positioning of clothes among the thirteen deities indicate good and bad omens. Refer to the diagram.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Difficult Childbirth</h3>
<p>Women primarily rely on blood, and when the qi is smooth, the blood harmonizes, leading to a safe delivery. However, in wealthy households, excessive comfort can cause qi stagnation, preventing the fetus from moving, or sometimes the mingling of essence and blood in the womb leads to childbirth difficulties. If the abdomen hurts intermittently, it is called &quot;playing with the fetus,&quot; and if the midwife is unaware and examines the water, it can lead to the rupture of membranes and dryness, making it difficult for the child to turn or be born. Generally, childbirth should occur when contractions are extreme and the child is pressing against the birth canal; only then is it appropriate to sit on grass. In the heat of summer, if there is an outpouring of blood, it’s important to drink clear water to resolve it. At the end of winter and the beginning of spring, warmth should be provided to the lower part of the birthing room with fire, and the clothing must be thick and warm to prevent the fetus from being chilled. Bathing the head and washing the feet in the last month may also cause childbirth difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the membranes rupture early and the blood and water dry up, resulting in labor exhaustion affecting the qi and blood, decocting Eight Treasures Decoction or Complete Nourishing Decoction with additional Motherwort and taking it occasionally can provide support. Alternatively, using several pounds of Astragalus, and around four to five pounds of Angelica and Chuanxiong, boiled in a large pot of water can fill the room with medicinal vapor to benefit the mother. The umbilical cord should be burnt with oil paper for cauterization to restore the vital energy. Midwives must be experienced and should first provide assistance while informing the patient. If labor progresses slowly, simply say it&#39;s not yet time; if it’s a twin pregnancy, indicate that the afterbirth hasn&#39;t yet been expelled. Fear can disperse the qi, making it even more difficult for the labor to be successful.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Difficult Labor by Guo Jizhong</strong></p>
<p>Difficult labor occurs when the fetus is not positioned correctly, causing the head to rest on blood clots, which, along with stagnant blood within the womb, obstructs the ease of delivery. As a result, the labor becomes difficult, and one should urgently administer Shengjin Powder to disperse the blood, facilitating the baby’s birth. Chen Wuze states that this often happens when the fetus has not turned properly, when the mother begins labor too early, or when excessive effort is made, resulting in the rupture of the amniotic sac and the drying up of blood and fluids. This can lead to a constricted birth canal, making the descent difficult for the baby. It is advisable to first take a labor-inducing remedy like Shen San to stabilize the blood. If there is a transverse or breech presentation, one should apply acupuncture according to established methods.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Yangzi&#39;s Treatise on Childbirth</h3>
<p>In all matters of childbirth, one must first understand these ten principles to avoid jeopardizing the lives of both mother and child through unjust causes. In the world, those who assist in births often lack skillful hands, leading to numerous deaths. Hence, I speak from experience and pain. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is proper childbirth. A woman carries a child for ten months, with sufficient yin and yang energy. If suddenly there are intense pains in the waist and abdomen, and the fetal energy descends, leading to extreme pain in the navel and abdomen, followed by severe pain in the waist, and the water breaks and blood flows, then the child is born; this is called proper childbirth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is obstructed childbirth. A person’s life is determined by the balance of yin and yang, each having its own time that cannot be altered. If, before childbirth has progressed for a month, the woman suddenly experiences abdominal pain as if she is about to give birth but nothing happens, this is called trial labor, not proper childbirth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, if the mother has not reached the signs of proper childbirth, one should not support her by holding her waist, nor should the mother recklessly exert force. For a woman who wishes to give birth, if there is abdominal pain but the baby is not in position, the assisting midwife may advise the mother to exert herself. If the baby merely shifts slightly and the mother exerts excessive pressure, it may cause the baby to become misaligned or turned incorrectly, preventing a proper birth—all of which are results of inappropriate force applied by the midwife.</p>
<p>For any mother giving birth, one must wait until the child is correctly positioned to begin pushing at the moment of delivery; this is the appropriate time for the mother to exert herself.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block original">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>若未有正产之候，而用力太早，并妄服药饵，或有所伤动，令儿下生。譬如揠苗而助长，无益而有害矣。此名伤产。　　三曰催产。言妇人欲产，浆破血下，脐腹作阵疼痛极甚，腰重谷道挺迸，头至产门已见，是正产之候，但儿却未生，即可服药以催之。或有经及数日，产母困苦，已分明见得是正产之候，但儿子难生，亦可服药，以助产母之正气，令儿速得下生。此名催产。　　四曰冻产。冬月天冷，产母经血得冷则凝，以致儿子不能生下，此害最深。若冬月产者，下部不可脱去绵衣，并不可坐卧寒处，当满房着火，常有暖气，令产母背身向火，令脐下腿膝间常暖，血得热则流散，使儿易生。此名冻产。　　五曰热产。盛夏之月，产妇要温凉得所，不可恣意取凉，伤损胎气；亦不可人多，热气逼袭产母，使产母血沸，而有发热头痛面赤昏运如醉，乃至不知人事。此名热产。若夏月风凉阴雨，亦不可任意取凉，恐生大病。　　六曰横产。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the signs of a proper delivery have not yet appeared and one exerts effort too early, recklessly takes medicine, or causes any disturbance, it may result in the child being born prematurely. This is akin to pulling seedlings to hasten their growth, which is of no benefit and can be harmful. This is called injuring the delivery.</p>
<p>The third is called inducing labor. When a woman is about to give birth, with her waters breaking and blood flowing, she experiences severe abdominal pain, a heavy feeling in her waist, and her head is already visible at the birth canal; these are the signs of a proper delivery. If, however, the child does not arrive, it is appropriate to take medicine to induce the birth. Even if several days have passed and the mother experiences intense discomfort while the signs of a proper delivery are evident, if the child is still difficult to deliver, it is also permissible to take medicine to support the mother&#39;s vital energy and expedite the child&#39;s birth. This is called inducing labor.</p>
<p>The fourth is called obstructed delivery. In the cold winter months, if the mother&#39;s menstrual blood becomes cold and congeals, it can prevent the child from being born, which is very detrimental. A woman giving birth in winter should not remove her warm clothing from her lower body and should avoid sitting or lying in cold places. The room should be kept warm with a fire, allowing the mother to face the warmth while ensuring her lower abdomen and knees remain warm. If the blood warms up, it will flow easily, facilitating the child&#39;s birth. This is called obstructed delivery.</p>
<p>The fifth is called heated delivery. In the hot summer months, the mother needs to maintain a suitable temperature; she should not excessively seek coolness, which can damage the vital energy of the fetus. Crowding is also to be avoided, as the heat may overwhelm the mother, causing her blood to boil and leading to symptoms like fever, headache, flushed face, and disorientation, to the point where she may not recognize those around her. This is called heated delivery. Even in cool windy or rainy summer weather, one should not seek excessive coolness, as it could lead to serious illness.</p>
<p>The sixth is called transverse delivery.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the child&#39;s hand or arm comes out first, this is due to the mother exerting herself improperly before the appropriate time. If the child&#39;s body is not positioned correctly and there is a forceful push, it can result in the body being crossed and unable to be born. The mother should be comfortably lying on her back, and then the attendant should first push the hand, guiding it up straight so that the head aligns with the birth canal. Gradually encourage the body down, using the middle finger to massage the shoulder without constraining the umbilical cord, guiding it upwards and correcting it, or using a finger to grasp the ear for correction. The mother must be lying on her back as you guide the child upwards slowly and steadily. When the body is aligned, give her a prepared herbal decoction, and only then can she begin to push for the child to be born. This is known as transverse presentation.</p>
<p>The seventh situation is called breech presentation. When the mother lacks sufficient energy and the contractions are not strong, pushing too soon can prevent the child from turning, causing the feet to come out first. The mother should lie on her back, and the attendant should gently push the feet back in. The mother must not exert any effort whatsoever, nor should there be any panic, allowing the child to position itself naturally.</p>
<p>The eighth situation is known as oblique presentation. If the child is not properly aligned and the mother pushes, the head can get lodged against the left or right leg, making it unable to descend even if the head is visible. The mother should lie on her back, and the attendant should gently push the child upward, using their hands to align the head properly. Once the head is correctly positioned, the mother can then push to give birth.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

The mother should be instructed to exert her effort to assist in the delivery. This situation is called &quot;tilted birth.&quot;</p>
<p>The ninth situation is called &quot;obstructed birth.&quot; If the infant&#39;s body is positioned correctly, with the top of the head visible but unable to emerge, it may be due to the body twisting, causing the abdomen to compress the shoulders. In this case, the mother should lie on her back, and the attending person should gently push the infant upward while gradually guiding with the hand. Using the middle finger, apply pressure below the infant&#39;s shoulder to adjust the abdomen, ensuring the infant&#39;s body is aligned before the mother exerts her effort to deliver the child. This is referred to as &quot;obstructed birth.&quot;</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child is about to be born, if the mother is fatigued and has been sitting for a long time leaning against a mattress, obstructing the birth path, she should urgently tie a handkerchief to a high point and hold onto it with her hand, gently bending her legs and sitting down to facilitate the child&#39;s birth, without sitting on any object. This is called sitting birth.</p>
<p>The eleventh method is called &quot;coiled intestines birth.&quot; When giving birth, the mother&#39;s intestines come out first before the child, and the intestines do not retract. Mix half a cup of vinegar with half a cup of freshly drawn water and apply it to the face of the birthing mother. With each application, the intestines retract; after three applications, they should retract completely. This is an effective method.</p>
<p>Note: According to ancient methods, 49 seeds of hemp should be ground and applied to the top of the birthing mother’s head to help retract the intestines, which should then be washed off quickly. If the intestines are out, use a small amount of moistened grinding knife water, warmed slightly over a fire, and drink a decoction made with magnetite, which should help in retracting them. The magnetite must be verified for use by yin-yang practitioners.

<p>Joint bones not opening and birth doors not closing</p>
<p>It is my humble opinion that when the joint bones do not open and the birth doors do not close, it is due to the fundamental energy being weak. Before childbirth, if there is a failure to regulate and nurture, the flow of Qi and blood cannot circulate properly. For joint bones not opening, indicating deficiency of Yin Qi, use the modified Xiang Gui Decoction and the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For birth doors not closing, indicating deficiency of Qi and blood, use the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Childbirth difficulty and death of the fetus in the womb</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty in childbirth and the death of the fetus in the womb often arise from being startled too early or violating prohibitions, leading to an early loss of blood and the drying out of the fetus. One must examine the mother; if her tongue is dark blue, the fetus is dead. Therefore, in the childbirth chamber, sitting and lying must align with the directions of the four seasons and adhere to the five elements to avoid taboos for good fortune. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The death of the fetus in the womb often results from being startled too early, violating prohibitions, carrying heavy loads, or frequent probing to check for amniotic fluid, causing the membranes to rupture and blood and fluid to deplete, resulting in fetal desiccation. If the mother’s lips and tongue are dark, both mother and child are dead. If the tongue is blue or there is significant swelling and tightness, the fetus is already dead. First, take one ounce of Ping Wei San with half an ounce of wine and water, decoct it, and then add half an ounce of saltpetre, or use one ounce of saltpetre with children&#39;s urine to mix and administer, which works wonders.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Mr. Chen Wuze, the symptoms should first be examined in the mother. If the face is red and the tongue is blue, it indicates the child has died; if the face is blue and the tongue is red, it suggests the mother has died while the child survives; if the lips are blue and there is foaming at the mouth, it means both mother and child have died. In the case of twins, one may live while the other dies. Heishensan is thought to be too hot and should not be used lightly; in cases where one fetus is already dead, it is safer to use Pingweisan, with shibuxiao and mercury to assist in expulsion, which minimizes harm to the living fetus. Furthermore, Guo states that when the mother suffers from a fever for six to seven days, the heat severely cooks the fetus, leading to its death.

If the afterbirth does not descend, apply flaxseed to the heart of the right foot; when the afterbirth comes down, wash it immediately. If delayed, the afterbirth may remain inside. The Yi Mu Pill is also effective. </p>
<p>If the afterbirth has not descended and you wish to cut the umbilical cord, you must first tie a small object to weigh it down before cutting it; otherwise, the placenta may cause sudden death. If lochia is flowing within the sac and causes abdominal fullness and pain, take the Dueling Life Pill or the Shixiao Powder to dissolve the stagnant blood; if delayed, it may not be salvaged. If the vital energy cannot mobilize, and there is no abdominal fullness or pain, use the Bao Sheng Wu You Powder to replenish and stabilize the vital energy. Apply flaxseed flesh to the heart of the mother&#39;s right foot, and when the afterbirth descends, wash it away; if delayed, the intestines may also come out. If the intestines do not retract, use this ointment applied to the crown of the head, and the intestines will retract by themselves. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Guo also mentions that at times, after the initial descent of the fetus, the mother may be weak and unable to exert more energy, leading to a halt in the expulsion of the placenta. If cold wind acts upon her, the blood vessels may become blocked, preventing the afterbirth from descending. In such a case, take one handful of black beans, fry them until well-cooked, mix with a cup of vinegar, boil for three to five times, strain, and divide into three doses to be taken warm.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p>For women in labor, the pulse is mixed with the channels.<br>[Note: In the &quot;Nanjing&quot;: One breath with three pulses is called &quot;off-channel&quot;; this means the Yang is doubled compared to Yin. One breath with one pulse is also called &quot;off-channel&quot;; this means Yin is quadrupled compared to Yang. The note states: &quot;Channel&quot; refers to the constant state; the stomach pulse deviates from its regular measure. In healthy individuals, one breath results in two pulses, and one inhale also results in two pulses, hence it is called the pulse of harmony. Therefore, with one breath, the pulse travels three inches, and with one inhale, it travels three inches; when breathing stabilizes, the pulse travels six inches. In one day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, making the pulse travel eight hundred ten zhang, indicating one cycle, returning to the original channel once more. Now, with one breath, the pulse reaches three pulses, and with one inhale, three pulses are also noted. When breathing stabilizes, the pulse travels nine inches. Over one day and night, the total distance traveled by the pulse is one thousand two hundred fifteen zhang, more than the count of a normal pulse and not returning to the original channel, hence it is termed &quot;off-channel.&quot; If there is one breath with one pulse, the pulse travels one and a half inches; one inhale with one pulse travels one and a half inches; when breathing stabilizes, the pulse travels three inches, resulting in a total of four hundred single zhang in one day and night, referred to as one cycle; this is less than the count of a normal pulse. Thus, it cycles and repeats, also not returning to the original channel, and is likewise termed &quot;off-channel.&quot;] It is described as deep, fine, and slippery.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Reducing a Fat Fetus</strong>  </p>
<p>After ten months of pregnancy, the body completes its development. At this point, one should begin to take medicines to reduce a fat fetus for easier delivery. In modern times, many people resort to the use of bitter orange powder. This is not without reason, but if the fetal energy is already robust, it is suitable for consumption. Moreover, both bitter orange and big belly peel can help reduce the fetus; however, if the fetal energy is inherently weak, why should it be further diminished? It is better to use the &quot;Rescue Life Powder&quot; to stabilize the fetus and nourish its energy, making the baby small and healthy for an easier birth, ensuring a more secure delivery.  </p>
<p><strong>Transverse Presentation at Birth</strong>  </p>
<p>All cases of transverse presentation are due to a failure to restrict one&#39;s diet and overindulgence in food, leading to stagnation in the five organs and disharmony in the six bowels. When the fetal energy is already robust, exerting too early or frightening the fetus can lead to complications. An urgent use of the &quot;Golden Liquid for Reducing the Fetus&quot; can help ensure the child is born smoothly.  </p>
<p><strong>Feeling Distressed Before Birth</strong>  </p>
<p>If one suddenly feels a blockage in the circulating blood and energy, losing consciousness, it is likely due to excessive exertion, leading to weak pulse dynamics, mental fatigue, a feeling of pressure in the chest, closed eyes, and stifled mouth—with a pale face and rigidity. Vitality may be at risk, and in such cases, &quot;Lifesaving Powder&quot; should be used urgently.  </p>
<p><strong>Difficulty in Delivering a Fat Fetus</strong>  </p>
<p>Why is it difficult to deliver a fat fetus? Those in wealth and nobility often despise bland foods, indulging in rich, fatty delicacies without moderation, eating to satiation before resting, which leads to thickening of the fetal sac and a firm attachment. This urgent energy during movement is because they have not prepared by taking medicines to reduce the fat fetus. Consequently, when the time for delivery arrives, it is certain to be difficult. One may take &quot;Wuyou Powder&quot; in the last month to facilitate an easier birth.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sitting on Grass</strong></p>
<p>When one suddenly suffers from impotence while seated on grass, with eyes rolling and mouth sealed, what can be the cause? It is due to indulging in unchecked joys and anger, which leads to the exhaustion of vitality and the decline of health. The fetus becomes hard to move; sitting on grass excessively can cause abdominal pain that cannot be tolerated, leading to rolling eyes, a sealed mouth, a dark face, blue lips, and foam at the mouth. Both mother and child may perish. If the mother shows a slight flush while the child dies, one should urgently administer the Thunderbolt Life-Taking Pill for rescue.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the child dies in the womb and blood violently descends, with the womb being unable to deliver, one should take Banxia Decoction. If the fetus is dead but not expelled, one should take the San Yi Chengqi Decoction. The issue arises from wind-heat drying and constricting, causing the birth passage to not open naturally. Symptoms include a reversed pulse, a taut pulse, a red or blue face, or a change in color to five hues, with abdominal fullness, urgent pain, and difficulty breathing—indicating that the fetus is no longer moving. If the hands and feet are warm and the pulse is slippery, it indicates a difficult birth, but one should promote and smooth the labor without forcing delivery. In cases where the fetus is dead and not expelled, take the San Yi Chengqi Decoction followed by a dose of the Yiyuan Powder. After a short while, frequently use oil and paste to mix with Yiyuan Powder and take warm. If both are expelled, the mother may survive. Difficult births or retained dead fetuses occur from wind-heat drying and constricted accumulation, preventing softening; thus, labor does not occur naturally. This medicine&#39;s potency can frequently relieve the accumulation and facilitate delivery. Afterward, care should be taken to avoid warming and replenishing to prevent the resurgence of dryness and heat.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Difficult Labor</strong></p>
<p>For women experiencing difficult labor, it is primarily due to dryness and tightness, preventing the birth passage from opening. Therefore, in the month prior to delivery, on the day of entry into the month, it is advisable to use a long flow of water to adjust and enhance the Yuan powder, taking it three times a day; the labor must be easier. After delivery, there will also be no issues of false heat or disharmony in qi and blood. If one has not entered the month, it is not suitable to take this as it may cause slippery stones to obstruct the fetus.</p>
<p><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong><br><strong>Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>Difficult labor is caused by deficiency in qi and blood. This often occurs when one does not take precautions during the months of September and October. There can also be stagnation of qi and blood preventing movement. In the month of labor, one should use wild <strong>tianma</strong> to brew a paste, and mix it with white soup. Combine thoroughly with oil and honey, adjusting with urine until perfectly blended.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Difficult Labor</strong> (by Zhu Zhenheng, Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>Difficult labor often occurs in those who are depressed and indulged, in wealthy and pampered families, while the poor and hardworking do not experience it. The medical texts only mention a formula for thin fetuses, created for Princess Huyang, which is not the ultimate truth. Why is this? When seeing those who use this formula, their difficulties seem to resolve. My sister suffered from difficult labor; later, when she was pregnant, she experienced a setback. I felt great pity. Observing her body as plump but inactive with needles, I contemplated for days and suddenly realized: this is the opposite of Princess Huyang&#39;s case. Those who are pampered have strong qi, while exhausting their qi leads to peace, hence easy childbirth. Now, with her plump body suggesting weak qi, long sitting indicating stagnation, her qi weakens further, and the fetus cannot move due to the mother&#39;s weak qi. By nourishing the mother&#39;s qi, her body becomes healthy and labor is made easy. When she was five or six months pregnant, I applied a formula for qi supplement and a dozen patches along with the major formula Zisu, resulting in a quick delivery of a boy. Thereafter, I further adjusted this formula based on the mother&#39;s condition, color, temperament, and seasonal changes, with every adjustment yielding results. Thus, I named this formula &quot;Great Achievement Birth Powder.&quot;<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Yang Zijiang&#39;s Method for Handling Abortion</strong></p>
<p>Yang Zijiang&#39;s discussion on abortion methods contains crucial insights that must not be taken lightly. If, before the full term of ten months, there are abdominal pains that come and go or are mild, it is termed &#39;misplaced pain,&#39; and does not indicate proper labor. If abdominal pain is severe but the lower back is not, it does not indicate proper labor. If the fetus has not yet descended, it does not indicate proper labor. If there is no thrusting or bulging in the birth canal, it does not indicate proper labor. If the amniotic fluid has not broken and blood has not come out, it does not indicate proper labor. If there is bleeding but no abdominal pain, it does not indicate proper labor. In the absence of signs of proper labor, assist the woman to walk gently or support her when she cannot walk. She may sit, rest, or take one or two doses of calming medication, then stop. Be cautious not to recklessly administer labor-inducing medicines, as this may cause anxiety in the mother and diminish her resolve.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<p>In Yang Zijiang&#39;s ten methods of delivery, there are four categories: 横产 (Cross Delivery), 偏产 (Oblique Delivery), 碍产 (Obstructed Delivery), and 倒产 (Reversed Delivery). If one observes the situation of the mother giving birth, one must not rely on these methods unless one is a skilled and proficient practitioner, lest ignorance lead to harm. The reversed delivery refers to cases where the child is often born with its feet first, and there is no subsequent issue, as both mother and child are intact; there is no need to adhere strictly to the methods implied for head-first delivery. In obstructed delivery, the umbilical cord may be wrapped around the top of the child’s head while the child’s head itself emerges from the birth canal; a practitioner may use their hands to guide the cord down from the child’s head. If the cord is loosely wrapped once around the head, and the child along with the placenta naturally descends, there is no complication, and it is not necessary to use methods for obstructed delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Delivery Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: If the breath does not circulate, the flow is exhausted; if there is no continuity even for a moment, the foundation collapses. The circulation of qi and blood must flow continuously; a lack thereof endangers the body. If a pregnant woman has the child in her womb, the mother and child share a flow of energy, entirely relying on nourishment. After ten months, the blood and qi are full, and both form and spirit are complete; suddenly, as if waking from a dream, she can use her hands to break the amniotic sac and find a path to delivery. Once outside the sac, with mother and child separate, their breathing may differ; they cannot remain blocked internally for long, leading to stunted circulation. For a robust fetus, once the sac is broken, it naturally follows the fluid down easily, resulting in an uncomplicated delivery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The weak and troubled ones turn their heads slowly; the amniotic fluid has dried up, and foul blood obstructs the path, causing stagnation. Thus, a miscarriage occurs, and the unborn child dies in the womb, leading to the mother’s death in an instant. Should this not be feared? Whenever anticipating birth, if the amniotic fluid has already discharged and time passes without delivery, one should deliberate and plan, using medicines to expel the bad blood, ensuring the path for the child is clear to prevent difficulties in labor. How can one simply wait idly for death? Therefore, the medicines for inducing labor—such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, Motherwort, and Malva seeds—are all meant to expel the foul blood. If the lower back and abdomen do not hurt excessively, and the fluid drips down, it is known as &quot;trial fluid,&quot; not true amniotic fluid. One should maintain a calm mind and wait patiently, not hastily allowing a midwife to intervene. If the mother exerts too much force to deliver the child too early, it often leads to complications; thus, one must be cautious. If the hands or feet of the child are not positioned correctly, or the forehead is slightly exposed, one should gently adjust it by hand, waiting for it to descend naturally. Difficult labor occurs due to the mother’s indulgence prior to delivery. Not only difficult delivery but also various postnatal ailments arise from this. </p>
<p>When asked about the women described by Danxi, who find childbirth difficult after eight or nine months without restraint, the answer is that when desires stir, the vital energy and blood are depleted. The development of the fetus relies entirely on the nourishment of vital energy and blood. When vital energy and blood are deficient, the fetus weakens. After the amniotic fluid ruptures, it cannot turn and descend with the fluid, leading to difficulty in childbirth.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Cheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>In October, when the Qi is abundant and the fetus is strong, if sudden abdominal pain occurs, or perhaps only back pain, and within moments labor begins, there is no need for urging; this is the natural occurrence of childbirth. It is advisable to take a single dose of nourishing mother paste to avoid postpartum complications. If there are individuals who are weak and anxious, experiencing intermittent abdominal pain, it is referred to as playful pain; if there is a trickle of fluid, it is known as testing water. Even if there is pain in both the abdomen and the navel, while the labor is vigorous and the waist is not painful, one must not be hasty. It is crucial to refrain from pressing on the abdomen or manipulating it, and simply wait until the time is right, when the abdominal pain intensifies and the water breaks, accompanied by back pain that feels like fire in the eyes, before sitting down to deliver. One must wait for the child’s head to descend properly and approach the birth canal before exerting force to deliver. If one sits down too early or exerts excessive force, it leads to maternal exhaustion and delays, necessitating the use of labor-inducing medicine.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All difficult births are caused by the expectant mother indulging in desires and being overly proud, leading to a lack of movement and consumption of raw, cold, and hard foods which cause stagnation. Some may have narrow pelvic bones; others may have a greatly enlarged abdomen with amniotic fluid not yet expelled; or if the presence of onlookers frightens the laboring woman, it can lead to a weakening of her spirit. When the spirit is weakened, the upper body becomes closed, and energy cannot flow downwards, causing distension and obstruction; in such cases, a sip of perilla leaf drink is most effective. For those with strong energy, use the weight-reducing sweet mixture; for those with weak energy, employ the labor-promoting decoction.</p>
<p>If abdominal pain occurs and the amniotic sac has not ruptured, one should use the ancient chuanxiong and angelica decoction to invigorate the blood. If the water sac has broken but there is only slight pain, or if there is pain without rhythmic contractions, one should take the calming fetus drink or the labor-promoting decoction to stabilize the fetal essence. One must not carelessly use strong medicines, as this could harm the water pathway and injure the fetus&#39; energy, making the labor more difficult. The mother can listen to her own needs for sleep and food, but should not overindulge in sleep or food.</p>
<p>If there is excessive amniotic fluid, the blood will become desiccated. In this case, the ancient black divine powder must be used. If there is blood deficiency, the ancient chuanxiong and angelica decoction should be administered, known as the black divine powder; if there is weak energy, the four gentlemen decoction should be given, known as the four gentlemen&#39;s black divine powder. For transverse or breech presentations, add a pinch of musk. At this point, it is like a boat sitting on sand; one must bring in water before it can be cleared.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

In summer, as heat causes energy to disperse and blood to boil, it is suitable to use Five Ling Powder with kuxingren. Alternatively, Three Retreats Six One Powder may be used. In winter, if there is freezing that leads to blood stagnation, the promotion of labor with Five Accumulations Powder is recommended. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>When approaching labor, there are six vital signs, known as the &quot;deviation pulse.&quot; If the pulse is deep, fine, and slippery, it indicates impending birth; if the pulse is floating and large, it signifies difficult labor, and if cold and hot sensations are frequent, this is an ominous sign, necessitating urgent observation of the complexion. The cheeks, lips, and tongue should avoid being black or blue. A red face suggests the mother will survive, but the child will be at risk. If the fetus is in the abdomen, both the child and mother may face death.</p>
<p>The &quot;deviation&quot; occurs when the pulse does not follow the usual pattern. In a day and night, the pulse cycles continuously. However, due to the fetus&#39;s descent, the gastric pulse deviates from its normal pathway and does not restart from the original cycle, hence the term &quot;deviation.&quot; A deep, fine, and slippery pulse indicates the kidney&#39;s essence is manifesting; if the pulse is deep but feels absent, it indicates imminent delivery, whereas a floating and large pulse indicates difficulty. If the body feels heavy and hot, and cold and hot sensations occur often, these are ominous signs, requiring urgent examination of the complexion and tongue to ensure the safety of both mother and child. The face reflects the heart&#39;s essence, and the tongue reflects the heart&#39;s nourishment. A blue complexion suggests liver deficiency unable to store blood, leading to premature rupture of membranes and an inability to move or turn the fetus. A blackish hue indicates kidney water suppressing fire, resulting in both mother and child perishing. Only a red face with a blue tongue indicates that the mother&#39;s blood circulates, allowing her survival but leading to the child&#39;s demise. If a dead fetus does not exit, the mother&#39;s life is also at risk.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Preparation of Medicines for the Month of Admission</strong></p>
<p>In the month of admission, one should prepare the following medicines: Buddha&#39;s Hand, Baoqi, Zhike, Elm Bark, Heishen, Dasheng, and Huairui Stone Seven Powder, as well as Shenqing, Baosheng, and Lizhong Three Pills, Cuisheng and Heihu Two Elixirs, along with Cuisheng Shenfu. Additionally, prepare Kuiszi, Shengdi Huang, Qianghuo, Zhu Ru, Wumei, Male and Female Shiyan, Gan Cao, Haima, Jujube, Chenpi, Ginger, Qian Hei Dou, and White Honey. Also stock no-ash wine, child urine, sour vinegar, white rice soup, bottles, pots, and scissors for cutting the umbilical cord line. </p>
<p>Among these, Huairui Stone Powder is used for blood entering the fetal membrane, causing it to swell and preventing delivery or for lochia rising and unable to revive. Buddha&#39;s Hand Powder treats severe blood deficiency. Jiawei Xionggui Decoction is for difficulties with delivery not opening the bones. Bima Zi treats the fetal membrane unable to move up or down. Shixiao Powder addresses lochia, abdominal pain, and loss of consciousness. Wax oil mixed with talc for application at the birth canal acts as a remedy for smooth delivery. Qinghun Powder treats blood circulation issues. Pingwei Powder, (Shibu) Nitrate, and Mercury are agents for decomposing a stillborn fetus. Ba Zhen Decoction replenishes blood and alleviates energy deficiency. </p>
<p>All the above prescriptions are crucial medicines and must not be omitted. When cutting the umbilical cord, first use a thread to tie it tightly close to the abdomen, then wrap fabric and bite to cut. If the weather is windy and cold, or if the mother and child are laboring with depleted vital energy, first tie the cord and use oiled paper to burn and sever it. This is the essential method for returning life and reviving the dead.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidelines for Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Inducing Labor Method</strong><br>Use smoothness to promote circulation, bitterness to expel stagnation, and fragrance to open the orifices and disperse blood. For those with stagnant qi, move the qi; for those whose vessel walls are exhausted, secure the blood first.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Expelling a Stillborn</strong><br>For those with cold, use heat to stimulate; for those with heat, use cooling methods; for those who are dry, use moisture to lubricate; for those in acute danger, use toxicity to induce expulsion.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Pulse Patterns</strong><br>The pulses of women about to give birth depart from the normal pattern, presenting as deep, fine, and slippery. If pain arises at midnight, labor should occur; if pain occurs around noon, birth is imminent. These four lines are often misunderstood. According to the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; departing from normal means that the pulse is floating; abdominal pain radiating to the lower back signifies labor is approaching. However, a departure from normal does not guarantee childbirth. It also states that if the pulse is departed from at midnight, then birth occurs at midday. The term &quot;normal&quot; refers to its usual state; thus, if a pregnant woman had a deep pulse on the left indicating a male child yesterday, but today the pulse is floating, it is a departure from the usual pulse, differing from yesterday. Moreover, with abdominal pain, it is known that she is about to give birth. &quot;Tong Zhenzi&quot; refers to the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; stating that one call results in three occurrences, indicating “departing from normal” as a resolution. Li Xi and Fan further refer to &quot;Nanjing,&quot; where one call results in one occurrence, stating “departing from normal” to explain deep, fine, and slippery pulses, but both interpretations are incorrect. &quot;Nanjing&quot; mentions that two occurrences although sharing the name “departing from normal” differ in pulse and principles.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>且《脉经》明言离经其脉浮也，不曾引援《难经》之文。合《脉诀》因其言脉浮，又添沉细而滑，同名离经，盖以前所诊男女脉，或云浮大为女，若只脉浮为离经，若平常见浮大为女之脉，安辨离经？故又增沉细而滑，以见离为浮大之常经，为常滑也。《圣惠方》云：夜半子时觉腹痛，来日午时必定生产。谓子午相冲，正半日时数也。通真子曰：夜半痛，日午生。此言恐未为的。又曰：腹痛而腰不痛，未产也。若腹痛连腰痛甚者，即产。所以然者，肾系于腰，胞系于肾故也。诊其尺脉转急，如切绳转珠者，即产也。生产有难易，痛来有紧慢，安可定以半日？当以活法。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Classic on Pulse clearly states that a floating pulse indicates a departure from the regular channels and does not reference the text of the Nan Jing. The Pulse Secrets add that besides being floating, the pulse can also be deep, fine, and slippery. This term &quot;departure from the regular&quot; essentially refers to the pulse of men and women diagnosed before, where it was said that a floating pulse largely indicates a female. If only a floating pulse is interpreted as a departure from the regular, how then can one distinguish between them? Therefore, they also include deep, fine, and slippery to represent that the departure from the regular can be a common floating pulse and is typically slippery. The Holy Compendium states that if one feels abdominal pain at midnight, childbirth will occur by noon the next day. This refers to the conflict between the hour of the Rat and the hour of the Horse, essentially indicating the time of day. The True Essentials say: pain at midnight predicts birth by noon. However, this may not be entirely accurate. It further states that if the abdominal pain does not radiate to the lower back, it indicates no birth yet. In contrast, if the abdominal pain is severe and also affects the lower back, then birth is imminent. This is due to the kidney being connected to the lower back and the uterus being associated with the kidneys. If the pulse at the wrist is turning urgent, like cutting a rope or turning a bead, then childbirth is imminent. Since childbirth can vary in difficulty and the timing of pain can be tight or loose, how can one definitively determine it by mere half days? One should rely on active methods instead.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Rescue from Miscarriage</h3>
<p>For a child born in a reverse position, one must never use needles to prick the soles of the feet or apply salt, as this will cause the child to experience pain and run about, making the mother’s life difficult to preserve.</p>
<h3>Rescue from Obstructed Labor</h3>
<p>For obstructed labor, the mother should lie on her back, and the midwife should carefully examine with a light to see where the umbilical cord is entangling the child. The midwife should gently and carefully free it, without haste.</p>
<h3>Prolapse of Intestines during Labor</h3>
<p>When labor occurs, if the mother’s intestines come out first and are exposed, with the child born afterward, and the intestines do not retract immediately, it is likely due to chronic deficiency of Qi, which cannot constrict. The blood becomes prone to flowing, and the lower source (of vitality) is not secure, hence the instability. To avoid this suffering, one should take more Dong Quai pills supplemented with Schisandra (five-flavor fruit) and cinnamon during non-pregnant periods to strengthen the vital source. When pregnant, one should take more Hu Lian pills with one tael of ginseng to tonify Qi; also, take San Bu pills to cool the blood. Caution is advised with medications that easily lead to miscarriage or weak births. At the time of entering the month, take Ba Wu Decoction with Myrobalan, Flaxseed flower, and honey-fried husk for about ten doses to help prevent this issue.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Complete Works of Jingyue</strong> by Zhang Jiebin (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Inducing Labor</strong></p>
<p>When approaching childbirth and experiencing intense abdominal pain, there is no better medicine for inducing labor than the &quot;Tuo Hua Decoction,&quot; supplemented with a small amount of cinnamon (five to seven fen) for stability and effectiveness. If there is a deficiency of qi and strength, add two to three qian of ginseng. If the deficiency is severe, one may add it freely. Generally, if the fetus is healthy and the pregnancy lasts the full term, inducing labor is unnecessary; what is called &quot;inducing labor&quot; is merely to assist the blood and qi to facilitate the process. It is advisable to use the Tuo Hua Decoction or the &quot;Hua Tai Decoction&quot; when the time arrives, adjusting based on symptoms. If the mother has been in labor for a long time and feels exhausted, she should take the Hua Tai Decoction to boost her qi and blood, allowing the child to be born quickly. For those with weak qi and strength, making it difficult to deliver, the &quot;Du Shen Tang&quot; is essential, adjusting the amount as needed to support her strength, which is crucial for inducing labor. However, if one uses qi-moving and blood-guiding agents prematurely, thinking they are inducing labor, it is like removing the bud from a flower or pulling the seedling from the soil.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Divination and Inquiry Regarding Childbirth</h3>
<p>During pregnancy and childbirth, one should not resort to divination or inquire of deities, as those akin to shamans and prophets often deceive for profit, speaking of dangers and misfortunes. When a pregnant woman hears such things, it leads to anxiety and fear. Such worries cause the qi to become stagnant and unyielding, often resulting in difficult labor; thus, it should be avoided.</p>
<h3>On Nourishing Qi and Blood During Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Before childbirth, clear qi is necessary, and after childbirth, blood must be replenished; however, one should not be overly rigid about this. If the spleen and stomach are weak, and qi and blood are deficient, one must take steps to nourish them in advance; otherwise, there will be many troubles when labor occurs.</p>
<h3>On Miscarriage</h3>
<p>The approach to preventing miscarriage is solely to ensure that the time of childbirth is both easy and swift. The ease or difficulty stems from the abundance or deficiency of blood, not from medicinal properties aimed at inducing labor. Abundant blood provides moisture, making labor easy, whereas deficiency leads to dryness, making it difficult. Therefore, before labor, one should primarily focus on nourishing qi and blood in preparation. Formulas such as Si Wu Decoction, Miscarriage Prevention Decoction, Five Blessings Drink, Little Nourishment Decoction, and Eight Treasures Soup are essential for preventing miscarriage. Misuse of slippery or stimulating substances, or premature use of harsh herbs to purify heat and move qi when labor is not imminent, can harm the essential qi and deplete true yin, leading to severe deficiencies. If one is robust and full of qi, then formulas such as Zisu Drink, Baosheng Wuyou Powder, and Miscarriage Prevention Zhiqiao Powder can be chosen for use.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>This remedy is used for women who are five to seven months pregnant. If there is any trauma causing harm to the fetus, or if the child dies in the womb, leading to excessive lochia and unbearable pain, this medicine can be applied. If there is no damage, the pain will cease and both mother and child will be safe; if the fetus is harmed, it will be expelled immediately. According to Xu Wenzhong&#39;s verified observations on fetal movement, it treats blood rushing upward, resulting in a feeling of fullness and obstruction in the abdomen, similar to snow melting in hot water. It also addresses issues before and after childbirth, such as body heat, stagnant blood, and abdominal pain.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The following text is for preparing medicine: </p>
<p>Grind the ingredients to a fine powder and take twenty pills the size of a bulging honey ball with wine. </p>
<p>For miscarriage: When the fetal energy is near term, it is advisable to take several doses regularly to facilitate easier labor. It also treats retained placenta. The prescription includes three to five qian of angelica, three qian of cooked rehmannia, two qian each of eucommia and Chinese yam, seven fen each of chuanxiong and bitter orange, and two sheng of water. Boil to eight parts, and take warm before meals. If Qi is weak and the body is frail, add ginseng and white atractylodes as needed.</p>
<p>Another prescription for promoting labor:<br>Eight liang of donkey-hide gelatin, three liang of talc, and one sheng of plantago seeds. Grind these three ingredients, take the powder with a spoon, and consume twice daily. This medicine should only be taken in the month of delivery, as it greatly benefits the nine orifices and should not be taken beforehand.</p>
<p>To hasten childbirth, as per Shengsan of Danxi: It is effective for difficult births and hemorrhaging. Half a heaping cup of yellow hibiscus seeds should be ground into a paste. Filter with wine to remove sediment and take warm for immediate effect. If there is hemorrhaging and intense pain in labor, take three doses. Eventually, the abdominal pressure will ease, and labor will progress smoothly. It is essential to wait for signs of a proper birth before taking it. </p>
<p>A verse says: &quot;Seventy fried hibiscus seeds, finely ground and mixed with wine to assist in emergencies. If faced with difficult labor, it prevents tears from the entire family.&quot;</p>
<p>Another prescription for transverse presentation:<br>One liang each of clarified donkey-hide gelatin and talc powder, and two liang of hibiscus seeds. Combine with one and a half cups of water, boil down to one cup, filter, and divide into two doses.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>催生柞木饮子</strong><br>To promote childbirth in cases of difficult labor (whether transverse or breech) and for stillbirths causing abdominal distention, this remedy has proven effective multiple times.  </p>
<p>Take a large branch of oak about the size of a hand, one foot long, wash it thoroughly, and shred it. Use five sections of licorice, each five inches long, also shredded.  </p>
<p>Combine with three and a half liters of fresh spring water in a new ceramic bottle, sealing it tightly with three layers of paper. Boil over gentle and vigorous heat until reduced to one and a half liters, producing a fragrance. When the laboring woman feels heavy pain in her waist and wants to sit on the ground, let her take one small cup warm. She will soon feel relief in her chest and will give birth. Do not take it if she does not have heavy pain in her waist. If she feels thirsty, she may take another cup, up to three or four, until she feels heaviness below, at which point she will give birth. This remedy is the most effective.  </p>
<p><strong>乳珠丹</strong><br>Also known as &quot;Bone Opening Ointment.&quot; A potent remedy for encouraging childbirth; it also addresses fetal death within the womb.  </p>
<p>Finely grind fragrant myrrh.  </p>
<p>Form into pills the size of a walnut with pig heart&#39;s blood for binding, coating with red mercury, and air-dry facing east. Take one pill and wash it down with cold wine. If there is no result after a long while, take another pill. For severe cases of difficulty in childbirth, use seven lotus heart tips, two cups of water, and boil down to one cup, allow to cool, and take one pill. If after a long time there is still no result, take another pill; its effectiveness is like divine intervention. If the fetus is low but the placenta does not expel, taking this will help it come out. When preparing the medicine, it is especially effective at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, or on the seventh day of the seventh month, the third day of the third month, and also at the dawn of the New Year’s Eve.  </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Wujin San</strong> </p>
<p>This is for treating difficult childbirth and fevers, where the fetus has died in the womb, possibly due to falls, drops from heights, or early agitation during childbirth, violating taboos, or other circumstances. Sometimes, the blood may come down too early before labor, and if the lochia has ceased, it can lead to a dead fetus with a cold body and inability to emerge. The signs include a red face and a blue tongue in the mother. If the face is blue and the tongue red, the mother is dead while the child lives. If there is a blue lip with foam, both mother and child are dead. There may also be twins where one dies while the other lives, and the signs can be difficult to determine; one must observe changes at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cooked Rehmannia Root, washed, sliced, dried, and roasted in wine</li>
<li>Real Cyperus Rhizome</li>
<li>Angelica Sinensis</li>
<li>Cassia from Jiaozhi</li>
<li>Peony Root</li>
<li>Ginger (peeled)</li>
<li>Sweet Flag (Acorus)</li>
<li>Black Soybeans (4 taels)</li>
<li>Baicao Frost (5 qian)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind everything into a powder. Each dose is 2 qian, mixed with half a cup of rice vinegar, and 6-7 parts of boiling water for warm consumption. If there is uncertainty about the condition, first take Fo Shou Powder with wine; boil and drink 2-3 doses to check. If not dead, both mother and child will be fine; if the fetus has died, it will be expelled. If it is known that the fetus is dead, take this medicine, then follow with Xianggui Powder shortly after, as if pushing it out with the hand.</p>
<p>For regular use to induce labor, also add half a tael of Talc Powder, 50 shredded sunflower seeds, 7-8 pieces of crushed oak leaves, and 2 inches of green onion, boiled in water to make a decoction. Talc benefits urination, oak leaves promote qi and remove blood, while green onion communicates the yang energy within. When the qi is vigorous and blood flows, labor will occur.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states: King Zai Chuan&#39;s beloved concubine was pregnant but unable to nurse. She summoned Chen Yi, who came and administered a pinch of a herb called &quot;Raw Gan&quot; mixed with wine, and then she began to lactate. Chen Yi subsequently examined her pulse and noted it was agitated. The agitation indicated residual illness, so he gave her a potion to dissolve stones, which caused her to bleed, with the blood resembling five or six beans in size.</p>
<p>The &quot;Yijian Zhi&quot; says: During the Zhenghe era, the daughter-in-law of Duke Cai Lu fell ill while pregnant. When her term came, all the imperial physicians believed it was a case of yang syndrome caused by cold, fearing it might lead to a miscarriage, and thus refrained from administering cooling medicines. Zhang Rui arrived, assessed her condition, and said, “The child is a weak fetus approaching its ten-month term. What medicine could possibly harm it?” He then prescribed the usual treatment and instructed her to double the dosage. Half a day later, she gave birth, and her illness disappeared.</p>
<p>The following day, she suffered from severe diarrhea and was unable to swallow food due to a constricted throat. The other doctors pointed out her condition and remarked that her two ailments were as contrary as fire and ice, and with the delivery so close at hand, even the gods could do nothing about it! Zhang said, “There is no need for worry. She shall be well today.” He then took several dozen pills for her to swallow, and her throat immediately opened up, stopping the diarrhea as well. </p>
<p>When a month had passed, Duke Lu raised a toast for her health, saying, “Your skill is miraculous; I would not dare presume to know. May I inquire about the medicine that cured both ailments?” Zhang responded, “This medicine is not recorded in the classics; I applied my insight to it. The remedy used before was Aconite Pill wrapped in Purple Snow. For constricted throats not opening, only extremely warming medicines are effective. Once it was swallowed, there was nothing left to impede it, as what finally reached the stomach was the potency of Aconite. That is why one dose cured both ailments.” The Duke greatly marveled at this.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

Chen stated: &quot;This child is suspended. If the fetus were dead, there would be distinguishing signs: a red face with a blue tongue indicates a dead fetus and a living mother; a blue face with a red tongue and drooling indicates a living fetus and a dead mother; both blue lips and mouth indicate both mother and child are dead.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: A pregnant woman experienced abdominal distension, difficult urination, and vomiting. Various physicians administered warming and gas-relieving medicines, but she only vomited more and her distension worsened, causing an extreme feeling of fullness and discomfort in her chest. Upon examination, it was discovered that the fetus had been dead for a long time, and the medicine for expelling a dead fetus could not take effect. Eventually, she was given carp soup. The commentary states: When a pregnant woman experiences swelling all over her body, or intense pressure and swelling in the chest and abdomen, it is termed &#39;fetal water.&#39; Therefore, they looked closely at the woman&#39;s chest and abdomen, which were indistinct, and urgently administered three to five doses of carp soup. Both her bowel movements and urination expelled foul water, and the swelling subsided, allowing her to give birth to the dead fetus. This condition often arises because the abdominal swelling from pregnancy is not recognized, and everyone assumes that this is normal for pregnancy, unaware of the dangers of &#39;fetal water.&#39;<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A pregnant woman, five months along, took the Red Pill and had a miscarriage. Following that, she experienced abdominal swelling and pain, and took a remedy to break the blood, which only intensified the pain, making her afraid to touch her abdomen. I said: &quot;This potent medicine severely harms the spleen and stomach.&quot; I prescribed two doses of Eight Treasures, doubling the ginseng, astragalus, pinellia, frankincense, and myrrh, and the pain stopped; after several doses, she felt at ease.</p>
<p>In the winter of the next year, a woman from Jing had a difficult childbirth that exhausted her vital energy. The child was already dead at birth. Using oiled paper to burn and cut the umbilical cord, I applied its warmth, and soon after, the child made a sound. This child later showed no signs of being harmed or having loose stools from feeding, demonstrating the effectiveness of the previous method. In the world, using knives to cut the umbilical cord can endanger both mother and child, yet people remain unaware of the cause. Moreover, midwives often give small benefits regularly and earn the trust of mothers, providing them comfort, so there are fewer worries.</p>
<p>One midwife said: &quot;I only had one girl whom I was assisting during childbirth, but while I was out checking on the street patrol, she was startled and died before delivering. Later, when I saw the patrol, I was sternly reprimanded. Upon returning, I found the mother; though the baby was positioned correctly, the head was tilted to one side, causing a difficult delivery. Due to fear of the patrol, I didn&#39;t dare to intervene, resulting in both mother and child being unable to be saved.&quot;<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The official Li Mengqing married a woman aged thirty-five as his secondary wife.

Ultimately, the birth canal did not open, but after taking just one dose, she suddenly gave birth.</p>
<p>In the case of Fei Huaide&#39;s wife, the birth canal also did not open, and she had not given birth for two days. After taking ten doses of the previously mentioned medicine, she delivered promptly. Huaide transmitted the use of this prescription, and no one who has used it has failed.</p>
<p>A woman faced the greatest difficulty in labor, and after forty pregnancies, she experienced excessive bleeding, with her birth canal not opening. After taking one dose of the previous decoction, she also drank a decoction of Wu You San to assist with her blood and aid in delivery.</p>
<p>The daughter of a midwife worked hard and carried heavy loads during her pregnancy, suffering from cold heaviness in her abdomen and foul breath.

<p>A woman experienced fetal death and took (Shi Bu) xia to expel the foul fluids. She felt weak, and her breath was faint. I used the Si Junzi as the primary medicine, complemented with Si Wu, ginger, and cinnamon, and she recovered.</p>
<p>One woman failed to expel the placenta, suffering from swelling and pain in her chest and abdomen, feeling so uneasy that she did not dare approach it. I instructed her to take a dose of rolling wine mixed with Shi Xiao San, and both the lochia and placenta were expelled.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman in childbirth had not expelled the afterbirth, and experienced abdominal pain. When pressure was applied, the pain slightly eased; this was due to qi deficiency which prevented the expulsion. Therefore, she was administered Wuyou San to facilitate the process. In similar cases, midwives often suggested taking Yimucao pills; occasionally, placing the mother’s hair in her mouth induced vomiting, causing the afterbirth to emerge. If the afterbirth does not come out, death is certain. The aforementioned method proved very effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A patient, suffering from asthma and unable to lie down, was treated by many for lung qi affected by wind. Lü Cangzhou diagnosed the condition, finding the pulse at the cun position to be twice as strong as normal, with a rapid, wiry pulse at jueyin, and both pulses short and deviating from their normal path. He explained that the illness stemmed from toxic medicine stirring the blood, leading to fetal death and failure to descend; this was not a case of wind or cold causing asthma. Thus, he prescribed a labor-inducing decoction with additions of Chuanxiong and Angelica, to be taken in two to three liters. At midnight, a dead fetus was indeed expelled, and the asthma ceased. Ha San closely instructed that the patient, in truth, had a pregnancy distress from jealousy by her husband, hence the medicine was implicated; of this, many were unaware and felt ashamed when they departed.</p>
<p>A woman had been in labor for seven days with no delivery despite numerous treatments. Pang Anchang examined her and instructed her family to warm her lower back and abdomen with soup and to gently massage her. The pregnant woman felt slight pain in her intestines and moaned, and eventually gave birth to a boy, causing great surprise without understanding why. Pang said: &quot;The child has already entered the womb, but a hand mistakenly held the mother&#39;s intestines, preventing detachment. It was not something medicine could remedy. I felt for the child&#39;s hand through the abdomen, and pricked the tiger&#39;s mouth; the pain made the hand retract, resulting in a quick birth without other techniques.&quot; Upon examining the child, traces of needles remained at the right hand&#39;s tiger&#39;s mouth.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman was in labor for several days without delivering and the labor-inducing medicine was ineffective. Pang Anchang said: &quot;This must be because she sat down too early, her heart is filled with fear, causing her energy to be blocked and unable to move. This is not due to disobedience.&quot; The Suwen states: &quot;Fear causes energy to descend.&quot; When fear arises, the spirit becomes timid; when timid, the upper cavity closes; when closed, energy reverses; when reversed, the lower cavity becomes congested, and thus energy cannot flow. A dose of perilla tea resulted in immediate delivery. Additionally, he treated a woman with a suspended fetus.</p>
<p>A woman endured a difficult labor for seven days without producing milk and ate very little. Hua Borin examined her, gave her a bowl of cold porridge, crushed maple leaves, boiled the broth and mixed it for her to drink, which resulted in her milk coming in. When asked about the reasoning, Hua said: &quot;This woman has eaten very little; there has never been a case of childbirth without energy from grain. The maple leaves fall first and then reappear, hence we make tea from them.&quot;</p>
<p>A woman had a difficult labor for three days without delivering, and the medicines to break the blood and regulate menstruation all proved ineffective. Wu Jiaoshan then devised a prescription, using plantain seeds as the main ingredient, with winter melon seeds as the assistant, and white atractylodes and bitter orange peels as aides, which resulted in delivery by noon, surprising all the other physicians. Wu said: &quot;The Materia Medica states that this is the main ingredient for inducing labor. The annotations on the Book of Songs say to gather barnyard millet to prevent difficulty in childbirth.&quot;<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

Liu Fuzhen ordered red flower to be boiled strongly, propping the lady upon a stool. He used a silk cloth to soak in the broth and poured it over her, along with warming water. After a long duration, she regained her senses and subsequently gave birth to a boy. Indeed, encountering severe winter when the blood is cold causes stagnation, and warmth induces childbirth—most remarkable!</p>
<p>At an inn, a physician found a woman who had been in labor for several days without progress. Her lower body had grown cold, and they were out of medicine and in a dire situation. They boiled a decoction of pepper, orange, and evodia to wash the lower abdomen and enhance the circulation of qi and blood, which led to childbirth.</p>
<p>A woman nearing her due date suddenly lost her vision, unable to see the lamps. She suffered from headaches and dizziness, her neck and cheeks swollen, unable to turn her head. Despite treatment efforts, her condition worsened. By chance, she took a wind-dispelling powder, which alleviated her ailments, allowing her to give birth safely. However, her eyesight remained impaired, making it difficult to recognize people. Eventually, she took a herbal remedy with four essential ingredients, adding schizonepeta and windbreak, and also consumed a tonic for the eyes, gradually improving her eyesight. It was strongly advised against the consumption of wine, wheat, fried foods, chicken, lamb, goose, duck, tofu, and spicy hot foods, as well as physical intimacy. This condition arose due to the heat generated during pregnancy, caused by excessive warmth in clothing, or by overindulgence in wine and fried foods, resulting in increased heat affecting the fetus.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

Her face was red, and her mouth, nose, and tongue had a blue-black hue. Chen Dougan diagnosed her, stating that a strong pulse indicated that the fetus had not yet been expelled, and the redness of the face signified excessive heart fire and dry blood. The blue tongue and the black mouth and nose indicated that the liver had already decayed and the fetus had died. Everyone inside and outside said that the fetus had long since been expelled. He rediagnosed her, and with the color and pulse unchanged, he prepared a decoction of snake skin with Pingwei Powder, adding twice the amount of Glauber&#39;s salt and Angelica tail, and she took it. Soon, her abdomen rumbled like thunder, and she experienced cramps in her waist and abdomen, resulting in the expulsion of the dead fetus, after which her illness was quickly resolved.</p>

She requested treatment from the master, who used a detoxifying soup with Coptis chinensis, adding powdered cinnabar, which was administered to open her mouth and allow for feeding. There was some stabilization, and that night she gave birth to a boy. After delivery, she remained especially dazed and unresponsive, and with a seven-treasure decoction, she was soon at ease.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>
