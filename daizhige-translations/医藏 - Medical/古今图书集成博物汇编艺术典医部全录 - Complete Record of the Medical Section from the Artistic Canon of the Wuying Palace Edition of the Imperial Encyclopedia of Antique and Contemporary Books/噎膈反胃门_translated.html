<p><strong>Ethiopia, Reflux and Stomach Door</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Internal Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When Yang develops a disease, there is diminished energy, frequent coughing, and diarrhea. Its transmission affects the heart and causes chest pain, which in turn leads to obstruction at the diaphragm. [Note: Yang here refers to Shao Yang. Shao Yang governs the initial vital energy; when ill, this energy is decreased. The fire of Shao Yang generates energy, and if the energy is low, the fire becomes vigorous, thus causing coughing. The malevolent Wood and Fire impair Earth, leading to diarrhea. A deficiency in the heart then causes pain. The pathogen resides in the stomach, thus blocking the diaphragm and causing obstruction.] When the Three Yangs are obstructed, it is termed a diaphragm condition. [Note: The Three Yangs refer to Tai Yang. The energy of Tai Yang arises from the bladder, emerging from within the diaphragm to the chest and ribs; when there is a stagnation of Yang energy, the diaphragm’s energy cannot flow, thus preventing food and drink from descending.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Six Energies and Organ Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>When a person has a major illness in the lesser yang, it is one fold; in the greater yang, it is two folds; in the yang brightness, it is three folds; and if it is four folds or more, it is called excessive yang. <em>[Note: One fold in the lesser yang represents the spring rise of energy. The greater yang represents summer, the yang brightness represents autumn, and four folds or more indicates excessive yang, thus termed excessive yang.]</em> </p>
<p>When a person has a major illness in the absolute yin, it is one fold; in the lesser yin, it is two folds; in the greater yin, it is three folds; and if it is four folds or more, it is called barrier yin. <em>[Note: Four folds or more indicates excessive yin, thus termed barrier yin.]</em> </p>
<p>When both the pulse at the person’s greeting and the pulse at the wrist are at least four folds above, it is called barrier excess. The pulse of barrier excess is weak and cannot reach the essence of the universe; thus, death ensues. <em>[Note: Both being four folds or more indicates both yin and yang are at their extremes. When both are excessive but out of balance, they cannot connect to the essence of both yin and yang in the universe, leading to death.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on Blood, Qi, Form, and Will</strong></p>
<p>Suffering of the form leads to suffering of the will; illnesses arise in the throat, treated with sweet medicine. <em>[Note: Worries affect the heart and exhaustion affects the physical form, thus both yin and yang, as well as qi and blood, become harmed, causing illnesses in the throat, and sweet medicine is advised to regulate the spleen and stomach.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on Distinction Between Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>When there are blockages and closures, causing lack of communication Up and Down, it leads to sudden worries as illness. <em>[Note: When the middle burner is blocked, the qi between the upper and lower parts is impeded; this leads to the five stagnations as illness.]</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Qi Collapse</strong></p>
<p>When the liver transfers cold to the heart, it causes mania within the diaphragm.<br>[Note: The yang combines with yang, hence the mania. The liver&#39;s evil energy rises to the heart, causing obstruction in the diaphragm.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Pain</strong></p>
<p>Fear causes the essence to retreat; when it retreats, the upper burner is closed. With the closure, the Qi returns, and as it returns, the lower burner becomes distended, hence the Qi does not circulate.<br>[Note: Fear harms the kidneys, causing the essence and Qi to descend instead of rising. The zhong region functions as the sea of Qi, emerging from the lungs to control respiration, originating from the lower burner; thus, when the essence retreats, the upper burner is closed, and the rising Qi returns to the lower burner, leading to distension there. The Qi between the upper and lower does not connect, thus the Qi does not circulate.]</p>
<p>Thinking stores the heart and anchors the spirit; the vital Qi remains stagnant and does not move, resulting in Qi stagnation.<br>[Note: Through thinking, the heart spirit remains internally stored, leading to the vital Qi being stagnant and thus causing Qi stagnation.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of stomach wind include a sweaty neck, aversion to wind, inability to consume food and drink, obstruction in the diaphragm, a swollen abdomen, distension upon losing clothing, and diarrhea from eating cold food, with a diagnosis of a slender body and a large abdomen.<br>[Note: The inability to consume food and drink, along with obstruction in the diaphragm and a distended abdomen, indicates that the stomach is affected by evil forces. If the stomach Qi is insufficient, the body&#39;s front feels cold, and the abdomen appears distended, leading to a cold appearance. Diarrhea from consuming cold food indicates damage to the stomach Qi. The abdomen relates to the stomach&#39;s outer border, thus a slim body with a large abdomen results.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<h3>Discourse on Great Oddities</h3>
<p>The stomach pulse is deep and drum-like, the stomach is outwardly distended, the heart pulse is small, hard, and rapid; these are all signs of depletion of the diaphragm. 【Note: The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that &quot;drum-like&quot; indicates a lack of qi. The &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot; says that &quot;if drum-like, there is no blood; if large, it is deficiency.&quot; This deficiency of blood and qi internally and externally leads to the depletion of the diaphragm. When small, both blood and qi are deficient; hard and rapid indicate cold, and the deficiency of heart qi leads to cold and stagnant blood flow, depriving muscles and bones of nourishment, resulting in external depletion of the diaphragm.】</p>
<h3>Discourse on the Essential Truth</h3>
<p>Jueyin governs the heavens, and is overtaken by the wind-indulgent; people suffer from pain in the stomach and heart, aches in the sides, and obstruction in the throat, unable to ingest food or drink, with a strong root of the tongue, leading to vomiting after eating. During the year of Jueyin in spring, the wind-indulgent prevails, causing people to suffer chills and shaky sensations, heart pain and fullness in the sides, urgent discomfort in the abdomen, inability to ingest food or drink, obstruction in the throat, and vomiting upon eating. The triumph of Jueyin manifests as pain in the stomach and heart, ache in the sides, and severe vomiting, along with obstruction in the throat. 【Note: All of these manifest due to the overpowering of wind and wood, thus causing illness in the spleen.】 The recovery of Taiyin reveals that excess moisture leads to heaviness and fullness in the body, inability to digest food and drink, and rising yin qi causing discomfort in the chest. 【Note: All of these are illnesses caused by yin and dampness.】<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The revival of Yangming brings a surge of clear Qi, which can lead to heart pain with fullness, abdominal distension and diarrhea, bitter vomiting, cough with vexation, and illness in the diaphragm. </p>
<p><em>Note: Heart pain with fullness, abdominal distension, and diarrhea relate to the fire affecting the earth. Bitter vomiting arises because wood suffers from the punishment of metal. Cough with vexation and illness in the diaphragm indicates that the Yangming Qi is stagnating upward.</em></p>
<p>The Taiyin at the spring indicates that if defeated, cold Qi will rise and fill, preventing food and drink from being taken in. </p>
<p><em>Note: Excessive moisture ascends above the earth, causing the fullness to rise. The wet Qi rises and affects the Jueyin channel, leading to an inability to consume food and drink.</em></p>
<p>The Shaoyang at the spring indicates that if defeated, heat will reverse and rise to the heart, causing heart pain with fever, and blockage leading to vomiting. Shaoyin is the same. </p>
<p><em>Note: Heart pain with fever arises from the guests of the sovereign and ministerial fire ascending and affecting the body. Blockage leading to vomiting indicates that the guest Qi of Taiyin is causing illness.</em></p>
<p>The Five Constants discuss major principles of governance.</p>
<p>When the principles of transformation are prepared, the result is illness of obstruction.</p>
<p><em>Note: Obstruction indicates that the spleen is ill within, and the Qi above and below does not interchange.</em> The principles of low monitoring indicate a reduction in transformation, leading to retention and fullness, resulting in obstruction.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is due to damage to the spleen Qi.</em><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>In the realm governed by Lesser Yang, there are heart pain and stomach pain, with counterflow and obstruction in the diaphragm, signifying rapid occurrences. <strong>[Note: Heart pain arises from disorders of the pericardium. Stomach pain results from the wood element overcoming the earth. The earth, located centrally, does not flow through; thus, there is counterflow above and below. The swift nature of wind energy is why it signifies rapid occurrences.]</strong> </p>
<p>In the realm governed by Greater Yang, water and drink are trapped within, causing fullness and lack of appetite. <strong>[Note: This refers to diseases caused by water and humidity.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Great Discussion on the Six Elements</strong></p>
<p>The governance of Greater Yang results in two energies, causing the people to suffer from internal stagnation. <strong>[Note: Yang energy is confined within.]</strong> When wood is stagnated, people suffer from stomach pain, engendered by the heart and upper side, with obstruction in the diaphragm and inability to consume food and drink. <strong>[Note: The abundance of wood injures the earth.]</strong> </p>
<p>When the influence of Greater Yin arrives, it causes accumulated fluids to be trapped. <strong>[Note: This is a common ailment in spring.]</strong> When the influence of Greater Yin arrives, it leads to fullness, chaos, vomiting, and diarrhea. <strong>[Note: This is a common ailment in autumn.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Canon of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Manifestations of Pathogenic Qi in the Organs and Bowels</strong></p>
<p>A frail and rapid pulse in the spleen indicates obstruction in the diaphragm, where food and drink enter and then exit, followed by regurgitation. <strong>[Note: The spleen is cold and unable to transform food and drink, hence the obstruction in the diaphragm. The spleen is unable to distribute the fluids back to the lungs and outward to the skin and hair, hence the spittle emerging from the mouth.]</strong><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p>
<h3>The Spirit of the Divine</h3>
<p>Those who are troubled and anxious have their qi obstructed and unable to flow.<br>【Note: This refers to the injury to the spirit and qi of the heart.】</p>
<h3>The Beginning and End</h3>
<p>The Renying pulse is strong and frequent, known as the Overflowing Yang, and the Overflowing Yang represents the external aspect. The pulse at the Yuankou is strong and frequent, known as the Overflowing Yin, and the Overflowing Yin represents the internal aspect. If the internal aspect is not unblocked, it leads to death without treatment. If the Renying and the Taiyin pulse are both significantly strong (four times or more), it is referred to as the Closed Barrier. The Closed Barrier indicates a short timeframe for survival.<br>【Note: The external aspect refers to excessive Yang without the balancing Yin; the internal aspect represents excessive Yin without the balancing Yang. The Closed Barrier reflects Yin within and Yang obstructed outside, indicating the condition where internal Yin fails to harmonize with external Yang, signaling imminent death.】 If the Renying and the pulse at the Yuankou are both excessively strong (three times or more), it is referred to as both Yin and Yang overflowing. If not unblocked in such cases, the blood vessels become obstructed, the qi cannot flow, and it stagnates within, harming the five organs. If one applies heat treatment in such circumstances, it will change into another disease.<br>【Note: When both the Renying and the pulse at the Yuankou are strong, it is termed both Yin and Yang overflowing. Essentially, if Yin is excessive internally, then Yang must be excessive externally, and if Yang is excessive on the left, then Yin will be excessive on the right. If needles are not used to unblock the qi, the blood vessels will close up, qi will stagnate, resulting in damage to the five organs.】<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the five organs are not harmonious, the seven orifices do not function; when the six bowels are not harmonious, abscesses arise. Therefore, if the evils reside in the bowels, the yang vessels are unbalanced; if the yang vessels are unbalanced, qi is retained; if qi is retained, yang energy becomes excessive. When yang energy is excessive, the yin vessels are impaired; if the yin vessels are impaired, blood is retained; if blood is retained, yin energy becomes excessive. When yin energy is excessive, yang energy cannot nourish; hence it is called “closure.” When yang energy is excessive, yin energy cannot nourish; hence it is called “stagnation.” When both yin and yang are excessive, they cannot support each other, so it is called “closure and stagnation.” Those in the state of closure and stagnation cannot die at their appointed time. [Note: &quot;Closure&quot; refers to closure of the yin internally, and &quot;stagnation&quot; to obstruction of the yang externally. In such a state, both yin and yang are excessive and cannot nourish each other, hence it is called closure and stagnation, leading to death before its appointed time.]</p>
<p>When the pulse at the person’s external gate is fourfold, both large and rapid, it is called &quot;overflowing yang.&quot; Overflowing yang represents external stagnation, indicating death without remedy. One must carefully examine its origin and result, check its coldness and heat, to confirm the diseases of the organs. [Note: Overflowing yang refers to the overwhelming presence of yang qi within the vessels, resulting from the combination of qi and blood.] When the pulse at the inch (cun) position is fourfold, it is termed &quot;internal closure.&quot; Internal closure also presents as large and rapid, indicating death without remedy. One must carefully examine its origins in temperature to confirm the diseases of the organs.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>The Upper Diaphragm Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Qi is what constitutes the upper diaphragm, where food and drink enter and then return out. I have already understood this. The worm constitutes the lower diaphragm; the lower diaphragm releases food and drink at the appropriate time, but I have not yet grasped its meaning, and I wish to hear it completely! Qi Bo replied: When emotions are out of balance, when food and drink are irregular, and when temperatures are inappropriate, then cold juice flows within the intestines. When it flows within the intestines, the worms become cold; when the worms are cold, they accumulate. When they become lodged in the lower passage, the intestines and stomach are filled with stagnation, and the protective Qi fails to nourish, allowing evil Qi to dwell there. When a person eats, the worms consume the food. When the worms consume the food, the lower passage becomes deficient; when the lower passage is deficient, the evil Qi overcomes it. Stagnation persists, and if it remains, sores develop. When sores develop, the lower passage contracts. If the sore is inside the passage, it causes deep pain; if the sore is outside, it results in external swelling and superficial pain, with the skin over the sore being hot. </p>
<p>[Note: This arises from emotional imbalance, irregularities in food and drink, and inappropriate temperature. If the illness is located in the upper diaphragm, food and drink will enter and return. If the illness is in the lower diaphragm, food will only return at the appropriate time. The stomach is the sea of water, grains, and blood Qi. When affected by external evils, juices and froths seep and remain outside the intestines; if they do not disperse, they accumulate over time. If due to internal injury, the juices and froths stay within the intestines, they gradually soak and form sores. Sores in the interior cause deep pain; those in the exterior cause superficial pain, and the skin over the sores must be hot.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</p>
<p>Guan Ge</p>
<p>The pulse can be too full, insufficient, have yin and yang intermingled, and can be excessive or deficient, related or unconnected—what does this mean? Indeed. The pulse before the guan (barrier) represents the movement of yang. The pulse should reveal nine parts and one inch to be deep; if it is excessive, it is called too full, if it is reduced, it is termed insufficient, thus entering the measurement scale as covering or unblocking, which reflects the yang pulse. Therefore, it is said that excess and overflow represent the true pulse of the organs, leading to death without illness. The classic says that qi exclusively circulates in the five organs, without engaging in the six bowels; why is that? Indeed. Qi flows as water does, without pause, hence the yin pulse nourishes the five organs while the yang pulse nourishes the six bowels, resembling a ring without end, where its course is unknown, ending and beginning anew. When there is no overflow, human qi remains warm in the organs and moist on the skin.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Golden Coffer Essentials</strong> [Han, Zhang Ji]</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Stomach Reflux</strong></p>
<p>In the Vomiting chapter it says: A question was asked: If a patient has a rapid pulse, and the rapidity indicates heat, why do they vomit after consuming grains? The master replied: This is to induce sweating, leading to a slight yang, causing the diaphragm qi to be empty, resulting in a rapid pulse. The rapid pulse represents an external heat that cannot digest food, due to coolness and emptiness in the stomach. A wiry pulse indicates emptiness; the stomach qi is insufficient, leading to morning food being vomited in the evening, which is termed stomach reflux. Cold accumulates above, but the physician treats below, resulting in a wiry pulse, hence it is called empty. The pulse at the inch is thin and rapid; thin means no qi, no qi leads to a deficiency of nourishment, and deficiency of nourishment results in cold in the chest. </p>
<p>The pulse at the foot yang is floating and slippery; floating indicates emptiness, and emptiness damages the spleen. Injury to the spleen does not digest food, leading to morning food being vomited in the evening or evening food in the morning, with undigested grains, termed stomach reflux. A tight and slippery pulse indicates a difficult condition to treat. If vomiting occurs immediately after eating, one should administer Da Huang Gan Cao Decoction. For those with stomach reflux and vomiting, Da Ban Xia Decoction is prescribed. For individuals with stomach reflux and thirst desiring water, Fu Ling Ze Xie Decoction is recommended. For all types of vomiting where grains cannot descend, Xiao Ban Xia Decoction should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Middle Storehouse Classic</strong> [Han, Hua Tuo]</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Yin and Yang Dysfunction</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>When yang energy rises but does not descend, it is called &quot;negation&quot;; when yin energy descends but does not rise, it is also called &quot;negation.&quot; When yang energy descends but does not rise, it is called &quot;stagnation&quot;; when yin energy rises but does not descend, it is likewise called &quot;stagnation.&quot; The terms negation and stagnation imply that yin and yang do not mutually support each other. When yang rushes upward, it scorches the spleen and lungs, leading to jaundice, characterized by yellow and red colors, all arising from the extreme of yang. When yin moves downward, it freezes the kidneys and liver, resulting in syncope, characterized by blue and black colors, all stemming from the extreme of yin. Jaundice pertains to yellow jaundice, and syncope refers to cold syncope, both arising from the obstruction of the interaction between yin and yang. Where yang is scorched, treat with water; where yin is obstructed, assist with fire. This illustrates the way in which yin and yang complement each other.</p>
<p>Pulses: The strong pulse signifies heat in the chest before the guan, and upon reaching the guan, it transforms into nausea, heavy as thousands.</p>
<p>Regarding the obstruction discourse: &quot;Records of Ancient and Modern Examples&quot; states: The five types of obstruction are due to worry, labor, food, and thought. Qi obstruction relates to palpitations and a lack of flow, leading to nausea and chest pain. Worry obstruction occurs when oppressive conditions cause reverse qi, resulting in palpitations below the heart and cold extremities. Labor obstruction leads to prolonged discomfort in the side and fullness below the ribs, causing cold extremities unable to warm themselves. Food obstruction happens when little is consumed, yet there is constant discomfort and pain in the chest, impeding breath. Thought obstruction results in palpitations, absent-mindedness, and restless eyes. All these arose from concerns, anger, and cold qi entering the chest and sides.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Anti-Stomach Acidity</strong></p>
<p>When the stomach is tight, the person feels fullness in the chest and cannot eat, leading to vomiting. If this vomiting stops, food cannot be ingested. If one continues to experience this, it is termed &quot;stomach reversal,&quot; hence the tightness is slightly exacerbated. The pulse at the foot yang is floating and tight; a floating pulse indicates deficiency, while tightness harms the spleen. When the spleen is harmed, digestion fails, resulting in morning vomiting of last night&#39;s food and evening vomiting of the day&#39;s meal. If food fails to digest, it is called &quot;stomach reversal.&quot; A tight and weak pulse at the foot yang indicates a difficult-to-treat condition.</p>
<p><strong>Esophageal Obstruction</strong> </p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that a knot in the yang pulse is called an obstruction. This pertains to the coalescing of qi and spirit as yang. When relaxed, qi and spirit are calm; when overworked, they deplete. If there are inappropriate temperatures or imbalanced foods, or emotional disturbances, both qi and spirit become agitated, causing the yang qi to knot, while the yin qi becomes disturbed. This results in disharmony between yin and yang, leading to organ disorders. If an obstruction occurs in the chest, it is called &quot;obstructive qi,&quot; and if it remains in the throat, it leads to five types of choking. The five obstructions are caused by worries, anger, cold, heat, and qi disturbances; the five choke types come from worries, overthinking, labor, and eating issues. The symptoms include chest tightness, feelings of oppression, nausea, choking sensations, hindrance in eating, chest pain radiating to the back, discomfort below the ribs, a feeling of restlessness, and difficulty in swallowing. The treatment method involves regulating yin and yang, transforming phlegm, dispersing qi, achieving balance between yin and yang, which allows for smooth qi and phlegm downwards, resolving obstructions. Moreover, when there is deficiency below and qi rising, it causes a firm fullness in the heart area, discomfort in the muscles, pain like a needle, and difficulty bending or stretching, known as chest obstruction.<br><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The Confucian Way of Serving One&#39;s Parents 【Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng】</p>
<pre><code>        An Analysis of the Division of the Ten and the Fifteen Classes of Disorders
</code></pre>
<p>Disorders began with the nest of the Chao clan. The loss of the essence also began with this nest. Why is this? Laozi said: &quot;Less leads to gain, more leads to confusion.&quot; Moreover, it is commonly said that choking on food is connected to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which says little more, only that the three yangs belong to the diaphragm. The three yangs refer to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder. &quot;Congested&quot; means heat accumulation. If there is heat accumulation in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; if in the large intestine, there is inability to defecate; if in the bladder, bodily fluids dry up. When the three yangs are congested, both front and back are obstructed. When the lower passage does not open, it must reverse and move upwards, resulting in food not being able to descend properly, even if it does, it comes back up. The stomach is known as the sea of water and grains, daily receiving the new to replace the old, leading to regular bowel movements. Now those who suffer from choking are often unable to pass stool for three, five, or even five to seven days, which clearly indicates a deviation from this regularity.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Is it not the case that the three Yang energies are all congealed below, causing the large intestine to dry up, leading to the foods consumed being rejected by the throat? Even if they enter the great warehouse, they still emerge from the throat; this is the Yang fire not being pushed down but instead rising. Therefore, the classics say: &quot;When Shao Yang reaches, it causes vomiting and leakage, and food does not go down.&quot; Isn&#39;t this reasoning clear?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the &quot;Treatise on Qi Disorders&quot; states: &quot;When the liver transmits cold to the heart, it causes madness in the diaphragm. The Yang energy is weakened by cold; hence, there is impeded digestion and obstruction in the diaphragm; this is due to the interaction of Yang and cold, not solely dependent on cold.&quot; The &quot;Six Qi and Organ Patterns&quot; also states: &quot;The pulse of &#39;Ren Ying&#39; above four fullnesses signifies an obstruction of Yang.&quot; Wang Taipu remarked: &quot;When Yang is at its peak, it obstructs and rejects, causing food to fail to enter.&quot; The &quot;Zheng Li Lun&quot; states: &quot;Obstruction causes vomiting and regurgitation.&quot; Thus, the diaphragm must also be in a state of obstruction.</p>
<p>Later generations hastily divided conditions into five types of choking, attributing them to worries over Qi, food, and labor. Later still, they divided them into ten types of obstruction and five types of choking, leading to a plethora of classifications and increasing confusion. The issue of overeating in a person does not usually manifest all at once. Initially, it may cause harm from alcohol and food, or stomach heat might induce vomiting, or dizziness from wind might lead to vomiting.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The physicians do not investigate the root cause; they burn ginger in the fire and boil cinnamon in broth. Though cloves have not yet finished, cardamom follows; though spikenard has not yet finished, pepper follows. Even if it is said to harmonize the stomach, the stomach is originally not cold; even if it is said to nourish the stomach, the stomach is originally not deficient. If it is due to harm from drinking, one can only eliminate the drink; if it is due to harm from eating, one can only eliminate the food. How can one claim deficiency and then use heating tonics? Those who originally have no excess heat are still not within the scope of treatment. Those with pre-existing heat in the body will inevitably have the three yangs converge. Once the three yangs converge, food will inevitably rise. The physician still claims the stomach is cold and cannot accept; burning needles into flesh, moxibustion scorching the skin, enduring countless agonies. The heat of the three yangs converging is clear, but treatment is difficult; merely withdrawing stimuli is of utmost importance. It is like trying to stop boiling water with more heat—painful and counterproductive. Over time, this has led to mistakes by physicians. People say to descend the yang and nourish the yin, opening the eyes and sticking out the tongue, fearing harm to the original energy, but all is merely about maintaining harmony, obstructed and unresponsive, without any way forward. The intestines should be unobstructed, hence the noises they make. When the intestines are obstructed, it leads to choking illness.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Traditionally, there are five types of constriction in the diaphragm, with ingredients like ginger and cinnamon; and ten types of obstruction with additions of certain substances. Now, I have dismissed those methods, believing them to be questionable, allowing future scholars to judge. Some say that worry and anger can cause stagnation; can they be treated? I say: worry and anger cause blockages, identical to significant distress. Master Tai Cang noted that once established, these methods become obsolete and won&#39;t return for a thousand years. </p>
<p>In our time, Liu Hejian&#39;s treatment for obstructed qi and food, using the Three承气 Decoction, stands out uniquely in modernity. I now suggest to future generations that when using medicine, they should carefully consider the dosage. If the obstruction has persisted for a long time, do not attack aggressively. Even if one manages to resolve the obstruction, one must be cautious of future issues. It is best to first moisten and nourish the body with smaller doses of medicinal pills, gradually increasing them until the blockage naturally eases. </p>
<p>If there is choking or obstruction, resulting in phlegm, one can lightly use bitter and sour herbs to gently induce flow, and then treat accordingly; the medicine will be more effective. If that does not work, one can guide with honey and salt, ensuring a continuous interaction between the two medicines, promoting dispersion and consumption of stagnation. Do not use ba dou, as it exhausts the body&#39;s natural essence, drying up fluids and leaving toxins within. Some say this condition should be treated by expelling it; however, expelling it can lead to emptiness and discomfort.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Eastern Garden Ten Treatises</strong><br><strong>By Li Gao, Yuan Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Choking and Blockage</strong></p>
<p>When the throat is blocked, preventing yang qi from emerging, it is called blockage; when yin qi cannot descend, it is called choking. Blockage and choking oppose the flow between the throat and chest, causing stagnation in the channels; then the mouth may open and the eyes may bulge, leading to a near suffocation feeling. First, one should use medicinal herbs with spicy and sweet flavors that are entirely yang to stimulate the stomach qi and address the root cause, supplemented by herbs to relieve the blockage. During the cold months, when the yin energy greatly strengthens external yin pathogens, one should add Wu Zhu Yu, which has a strongly hot and spicy flavor, to the primary medicine to dispel the cold yin qi. In the hot months, when yang is strong, add Qing Pi, Chen Pi, Yi Zhi, and Huang Lian to scatter the cold qi and release the upward counterflow of yin fire, or combine with Xiao Pi Wan and Zi Shen Wan. The Zi Shen Wan consists of Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, and slightly added Rou Gui, totaling three ingredients. Alternatively, one might add Huang Lian to create a special pill, producing seventy or eighty pills, to be taken on an empty stomach until the food from the previous meal is completely digested, followed by light and delicious foods to prevent stagnation in the stomach.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Methods for Using Medicinal Herbs to Treat Impediments in the Throat and Diaphragm Causing Discomfort</p>
<p>The &quot;Acupuncture Classic&quot; states: For stomach illnesses, there is abdominal distension, pain in the epigastric region, discomfort in both sides of the chest, impediment in the throat and diaphragm, and inability to consume food or drink. The point to be selected is Sanli. The throat is the gateway for swallowing food, while the diaphragm separates the heart and lungs. When there is an obstruction, the ascending and descending vital energies cannot communicate freely. It is also said that if clear energy is in the lower region, it leads to food retention, resulting in diarrhea that is yellow and like paste, indicating that grains are not being digested. Conversely, if turbid energy rises, it causes abdominal distension, leading to difficulties in defecation; either constipation or diarrhea may ensue. When the turbid energy is stuck above and should descend but does not, the yin energy drawn in by the kidneys and liver cannot move downwards and instead remains trapped, causing the stomach&#39;s energy to rebel upwards, resulting in nausea, vomiting, or belching. This is due to the upward surge of yin fire conflicting with the incoming energy, preventing food from being ingested. All of this is caused by the fire of obstructed energy, reversing the flow of the stomach&#39;s channels upwards.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>When the clear energy descends, it leads to symptoms of food retention. On days when the stomach energy is not ill, it should rise to support the heart and lungs and nourish the channels. However, due to irregularities in diet and excessive labor on the body, the heart fire occupies the earth’s position, weakening the stomach energy and causing it to sink into the yin. Thus, when grains enter but cannot ascend or descend, it results in food retention. The space between the throat and diaphragm is severely obstructed, preventing communication, all of which is caused by the counterflow of the penetrating vessel. Stomach ailments cause upward disruption in both flanks, and with the throat and diaphragm not open, food cannot descend, so one must choose points on the stomach meridian (Zu San Li). The &quot;Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states that when clear and turbid energies are mixed and disordered in the chest, it is called great disturbance. Great disturbance refers to confusion. When energy does not circulate properly, it is a critical condition. If not urgently addressed, various changes will occur. </p>
<p>Treatment principle: When there is insufficient yang energy and excess yin energy, one should first tonify the yang and then drain the yin; this ensures that yang energy rises in the yang aspect before draining yin. In the spring and summer months, when yang energy is present in the channels, one should enhance the meridians and eliminate blood stasis; in autumn and winter when yang energy is subdued, one must first treat the internal organs.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The spleen governs the five organs, associated with yin and blood; the esophagus governs the six bowels, associated with yang and qi. Both arise from the latent yang within the yin. Now, I will establish methods for administering medicine and treatments corresponding to the four seasons.</p>
<p>In winter, during the three months, yin energy is external, and yang energy is internal. One should support the yang from outside without inducing sweating, eliminating internal yin fire and preventing leakage; this is essential for confinement. Deep winter is when water is at its peak, and when water is abundant, metal becomes strong. The child (organs) can make the mother (organs) substantial. The lungs are the mother of the kidneys, and the skin and hair represent yang. If the original condition is weak, reinforcing it with winter will exacerbate the symptoms. Therefore, patients often sneeze, have a runny nose with clear mucus, and in severe cold, they may produce thick mucus and sneeze incessantly. They are particularly intolerant of wind and cold, have frequent and scanty urination, and may cough up large amounts of clear phlegm, with disordered bowel movements, sleepless nights, and in severe cases, may manifest as phlegm cough, vomiting white froth, leading to wide-open mouth and bulging eyes, with breathing difficulties nearing cessation. For such symptoms, the prescription of Wu Zhu Yu Pills is indicated.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>In the third month of summer, during the great heat, the yang energy is external, while the yin energy is internal. Illness that arises at this time is supported by the heavens to strengthen the righteous qi and weaken the evil qi, allowing for self-healing without treatment. However, there are also cases where conditions that should improve do not, due to the excessive dominance of yin energy which obstructs the spread of righteous qi.</p>
<p>For instance, if there is obstruction in the diaphragm and throat with severe congestion, treatment should focus on using &quot;Li Ge Wan&quot; to clear lung fire and then follow with &quot;Huang Qi Bu Zhong Tang&quot; for nourishment. If there are symptoms like weakness or numbness in the legs, stumbling when walking, a tendency to lean or fall, pain and lack of strength in the arms, or shortness of breath, one should prepare a soup with Huang Qi, Ren Shen, Gan Cao, Bai Zhu, Cang Zhu, Ze Xie, Zhu Ling, Fu Ling, and Chen Pi, and take five to sixty pills of a kidney-nourishing formula.</p>
<p>Between June and July, when damp heat prevails, if there are symptoms of shortness of breath making it hard to speak, add Wu Wei Zi and Mai Men Dong. In cases of obstinate fullness and discomfort in the chest, with inability to eat, use the aforementioned soup of Bai Zhu and Cang Zhu, and take seventy pills of a formula to resolve fullness, adjusting as necessary.</p>
<p>Duan Xi Xin Fa [from the Yuan dynasty, by Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of obstructions, one must always use vomiting to release the obstructed qi, which does not necessarily have to involve phlegm. When phlegm is present, &quot;Er Chen Tang&quot; can be used to induce vomiting, which will help to descend the qi. If there is deficiency of middle qi that is not circulating properly, use tonifying herbs that aid in ascending and descending.</p>
<p>If cold is present above and heat below, the pulse in both wrists will be stronger than four times the normal level.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting can generally be attributed to four causes: blood deficiency, qi deficiency, heat, and phlegm. In cases with combined ailments, one must use leeks juice, children&#39;s urine, bamboo juice, cow or sheep milk, and ginger juice; for qi deficiency, it is necessary to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction, and the right wrist pulse will be weak; for blood deficiency, add children&#39;s urine to the Four Substances Decoction, and the left wrist pulse will be weak. Do not use aromatic and dry medicines, as their use would be fatal. It is advisable to favor light tastes.</p>
<p>To treat vomiting, use three qian of coptis, ginger juice soaked and stir-fried, two qian of hawthorn flesh, and two qian of Baohe pills, grind into a powder, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds, coated with animal fat, then boil it in ginseng soup mixed with bamboo juice for a second boiling, yielding sixty pills.</p>
<p>If there is phlegm, the Erchen Decoction should be the main treatment; the pulse at the inch position will be deep or large. If there is qi stagnation, it is advisable to use medicine that opens up and guides qi; the pulse at the inch position will be deep and thin. For internal deficiency with yin fire rising and causing vomiting, treat the yin fire.</p>
<p>For the young, the Four Substances Decoction clears the stomach. Blood dryness leads to constipation. Although the elderly might not need treatment, they should use ginseng and atractylodes to prevent qi deficiency and stomach weakness. In cases of qi deficiency, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with reed root and children&#39;s urine, or ginseng and poria powder, or leeks juice mixed with cow or sheep milk, or even donkey urine. Accumulated blood stagnating within must be resolved. If the stool is hard, treatment is difficult. Encourage eating rabbit meat for easier bowel movements.</p>
<p>Vomiting is akin to esophageal blockage; indeed, esophageal blockage is a progression of vomiting. The &quot;Elucidation&quot; mentions that the elderly should not be treated. If the stool resembles sheep droppings, it should definitely not be treated, as the large intestine contains no blood.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The &quot;Jufang&quot; focuses on the treatment of qi disorders. It discusses treating various types of qi such as cold qi, stagnant qi, counterflow qi, and upper qi using remedies like Anxi Xiang Pill, Ding Chen Pill, Da Chen Xiang Pill, Suzi Pill, Yungqi Powder, Renshen Pill, Jixiang Pill, Bai Chen Xiang Pill, Wei Jiang Pill, Yan Jian Powder, Qi Qi Powder, Wen Bai Pill, and Sheng Jiang Decoction. </p>
<p>For treating vomiting and esophageal obstruction, it recommends Wu Ge Pill, Wu Ge Kuanzhong Powder, Ge Qi Powder, Jiu Zheng Pill, Cao Dou Kou Pill, Zhuan Qi Pill, and Renshen Dingxiang Powder. For sour belching, it advises using Dingxiang Decoction Pill and Xiao Lizhong Pill. To address phlegm and fluid retention, it suggests Bei Zhu Pill, Xiaoyin Pill, Wen Zhong Hua Tan Pill, and Wu Tao Pill.</p>
<p>Additionally, in each section, it mentions symptoms such as bitter mouth, loss of taste, sour belching, clear water vomiting, fullness and pressure, breathlessness, urgent pain in the side, heat in the five hearts, and mouth ulcers, all of which clearly indicate heat syndrome. Therefore, why use heat medicine for all? The life force circulating within a person is primarily qi; when yang rises, yin descends, and vice versa, with movements always in balance, without end.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>If one is not hurt internally by the Seven Emotions, nor influenced externally by the Six Excesses, what illness could there be! Now, what is called cold qi, stagnant qi, rebellious qi, and rising qi, all stem from the lung being invaded by fire pathogens, causing the qi to transform upwards, with ascent but no descent, suffocating and steaming the clear pathways, to the extent that the upper burner fails to receive, the middle burner fails to transform, and the lower burner fails to penetrate, leading to changes such as vomiting, esophageal obstruction, phlegm and fluid accumulation, retrograde swallowing, and sour regurgitation. To treat cold, use heat; to treat heat, use cold—this is the correct method of treatment. Using heat to treat heat, or using cold to treat cold, is contrary to the principles of support. Reflecting on the earlier sections, neither pertains to the correct treatment nor to the method of support, which is why I cannot avoid doubts. According to the &quot;Original Disease Form,&quot; it states: all illnesses of vomiting sourness relate to heat. All accumulations of fluids and fullness in the middle burner relate to dampness.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Various qi rebel, causing upward vomiting and overflow, inability to eat, all belong to fire. Various hard accumulations, fullness of the abdomen, urgent pain, and foul vomiting, all belong to cold. This deeply aligns with the meaning of Zhongjing. The &quot;Synopsis of the Golden Chamber&quot; states: for chest obstruction disease with pain in the chest and back, Guo Lou and Xi Bai Decoction is the principal remedy. Chest obstruction with heart pain penetrating to the back, and back pain penetrating to the heart, Guo Lou, Xi Bai, and Ban Xia Decoction is the principal remedy. For qi stagnation under the heart, with qi blocked in the chest and under the ribs, rebellious heart qi, Zhi Shi, Xi Bai, Guo Lou, and Gui Zhi Decoction is the principal remedy. For vomiting and qi stagnation under the heart, Ban Xia Xie Xin Decoction is the principal remedy. For dry vomiting with diarrhea, Huang Qin plus Ban Xia and Sheng Jiang Decoction is the principal remedy. For vomiting grains unable to enter, Xiao Ban Xia Decoction is the principal remedy. For vomiting due to issues in the diaphragm, Zhu Ling Decoction is the principal remedy. For gastric reflux causing vomiting, Ban Xia, Ren Shen, and Honey Decoction is the principal remedy. For vomiting immediately after eating, Da Huang and Gan Cao Decoction is the principal remedy. For gastric reflux with thirst, Fu Ling and Ze Xie Decoction is the principal remedy.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>For those who want to drink after vomiting, use clam soup. For a patient feeling like they might vomit but not actually doing so, or feeling a sense of helplessness, ginger and pinellia soup is indicated. For dry heaving with cold hands and feet, use tangerine peel soup. For reverse belching, tangerine peel and bamboo shavings soup is suitable. For dry heaving accompanied by diarrhea, use scutellaria soup. For those with rising qi, use soap pod pills. For rising qi with a floating pulse, use magnolia bark and ephedra soup. For rising qi with a sinking pulse, use alisma soup. For heat reversing upward qi, use ophiopogon soup. If there is phlegm and fluid in the heart area, fullness in the chest and sides, and dizziness, use poria, cinnamon, and astragalus soup. For shortness of breath with minor fluid accumulation, which should be regulated through urination, poria, cinnamon, astragalus, and licorice soup is suitable, and kidney qi pills are also effective. If the patient&#39;s pulse is deep and they want to relieve themselves but feel discomfort from retained fluid, use sweet saline and pinellia soup. If the patient has retained fluid, use ten jujube soup. For overflowing fluid, sweat must be induced; daqinglong soup and xiaoqinglong soup are appropriate. For fluid retention in the heart area causing significant dizziness, alisma soup is indicated. For chest fullness with fluid retention, use magnolia bark and rhubarb soup. If unable to breathe due to fluid retention, use artemisia and jujube soup for lung drainage. If previously thirsty due to vomiting, but now not thirsty because of fluid retention, use small pinellia soup.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>When there is vomiting, a feeling of fullness in the heart, and water between the diaphragm, along with dizziness and palpitations, the prescription is Xiao Banxia Jia Fuling Decoction. If a thin person has palpitations below the navel, nausea with frothy saliva, and dizziness, this signifies water, and the prescription is Wuling Powder. If there is stagnant phlegm and retained water in the chest, after expelling the water, if there remains a sensation of fullness and inability to eat, we must resolve the phlegm and air to restore appetite; Fuling Drink is indicated. If there is thirst followed by vomiting, indicating water retention in the heart area, this is classified under drink-related ailments, and the prescription is Banxia Decoction with Fuling. </p>
<p>In observing subtle signs, if there is excessive sweating that can be expressed, it should be encouraged; if there is stagnation, it should be guided out; if there is depression, it should be uplifted; if there is heat, it should be cleared; if there is cold, it should be warmed; if there is a mix of cold and heat, we should counterbalance and proceed accordingly; if dampness is involved, it should be diluted and drained; if deficiency is present, it should be nourished and supplemented. One must not routinely use pungent and warming agents to address fire with fire—who will be blamed for this? </p>
<p>Some say: &quot;The Pulse Classic states that heat causes wind, coolness generates qi, and cold promotes contraction.” Now, if cool air rises and qi is in rebellion and stagnation, how can it be anything but coolness? You quote Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s words to refute me, yet do all ailments of qi, phlegm, drink, vomiting, and acid reflux lack cold symptoms? I say: The five organs each possess their fire, ignited by the five emotions; this fire rises accordingly. If all ailments arise from cold, one must be exposed to cold air or consume cold food for it to truly be a cold illness—not merely internal fire diseases, of which there are rarely one or two cases of cold affecting qi. </p>
<p>Some argue that other symptoms like phlegm, qi, vomiting, acid reflux, and choking sensation are treated on the basis of heat and fire, which is reasonable enough.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>If a patient claims that cold energy rises from below, what can it be but cold? I said: The ascending energy emerges from the liver, while the intermingled fire arises from below, producing intense heat, which the patient perceives as cold; it is not true cold. When the fire is at its peak, it resembles water — the accumulation of excessive heat leads to an overabundance of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, hence this symptom of cold arising from energy is a misconception stemming from misguided theories. </p>
<p>If the illness truly arises from cold, it should be treated with remedies to dispel cold. Why resort to conventional methods using pungent, aromatic, and warming prescriptions? Ignoring the need for adaptability leads to potentially misleading treatments. Some say that for rising energy, one should use medicines like Heixi Dan, Yangzheng Dan, and Yangqi Dan to stabilize it. Those who take these medicines may find quick relief, but do you think that a disease marked by intense heat won&#39;t yield errors? </p>
<p>I replied: In addition to the associated fire, there is also the Yang fire within the organs. The movements of emotions each give rise to their own fires. The associated fire, as referred to in the scriptures, is the fire of &quot;one water cannot withstand two fires.&quot; This fire originates from heavenly creation. The Yang fire, according to the texts, is the fire of &quot;one water cannot withstand five fires,&quot; arising from human desires.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The fire from both sides stirs and moves, its energy rising along with the flame, ascending without descending—who can resist it? Now, by employing heavy dan pills to bring it down, the energy becomes stagnant and transforms into damp phlegm. The nature of the dan is hot and dry; damp phlegm is thus affected and temporarily resolved, resulting in relief. When dan toxicity accumulates over time, it further fuels the fiery excess, depleting yin blood and causing even more ascendance. Common people favor warmth, remaining oblivious and falling victim to this disaster—many are affected. Some say: the heaviness of dan pills seeks to descend yet does ascend; how then can this be resolved? I say: administer pungent coolness to dispel and use pungent warmth to subdue liver evils; treat with salty coldness, supplemented by sweet warmth, collecting bitterness and sweetness, harmonizing with mild sweetness to nourish yin blood. When yang is self-sustaining and yin and yang are harmonized, what is there left to ascend? The methods of ancient sages are not far removed; I will not elaborate further. Some say: various airs and drinks, along with symptoms like nausea, sour regurgitation, and stomach distress—are not adequately addressed in the “Jufang” text; I understand this. However, is the formula in the “Yao Lue” truly sufficient? Or are there still unidentified issues? I say: the transformations of the energies of heaven and earth are endless, and the diseases of the human body are equally variable. The book of Zhongjing carries the essence of the teachings. Good physicians draw on examples and analogies, which can be said to be of infinite utility, even if slight adjustments are made, they will ultimately not exceed the established standards.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>At the onset, illness manifests as simple disturbances. Its origins are often quite subtle, stemming from minor dietary indiscretions, exposure to wind and rain, fluctuations in temperature, emotional disturbances, excessive richness of food that bolsters yang energy, leading to the accumulation of heat in the diaphragm; or a robust constitution with a closed surface and no sweating, or a temperament that is easily angered, causing yin fire to rise and obstruct the flow of fluids, mixing the clear and turbid, resulting in illness; or experiencing distension and pain without appetite, or symptoms like hiccups and sour regurgitation, or a sense of fullness and bloating, without seeking the root cause, one mistakenly concludes it is due to cold and hastily treats it with pungent and warming substances, temporarily finding relief and mistaking it for a miraculous remedy, while continuing to indulge in rich flavors without restraint. This leads to carelessness, exacerbating past ailments, momentarily relieving the turbid fluids, which are then easily re-accumulated. The cycle may repeat in half a month or a month, with the previous illness returning. Thus, this prolongation leads to the accumulation of qi and the formation of phlegm, which causes sour regurgitation.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>A skilled physician has not been found, yet misguided treatments have been promulgated. Phlegm mixed with stagnant blood has formed a mass, leading to symptoms such as fullness, pain, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing, along with a range of issues arising from these conditions. The intake of food and fluids has become stagnated, with pathways congested and bowel movements either obstructed or loose, resulting in a disruption of transformation and transportation in the middle burner. Physicians, not perceiving this, continue to attribute it to cold, thinking back to previous remedies and hastily seeking immediate relief. Consequently, both doctor and patient lament that the medicinal treatments lack the necessary warmth and dryness, hoping that with prolonged use, the spleen might be warmed and the stomach strengthened, anticipating that one day, results will be achieved. They fail to realize that the stomach is the sea of food and fluids, rich in blood and Qi; when the Qi is clear and harmonious, it can receive; the spleen is the organ of digestion, and when the Qi is clear and harmonious, it can function properly. However, the use of fragrant and warming medicines merely exacerbates the boiling of Qi and blood. Initially, the gastric juices become congealed and unable to receive. Over time, the spleen&#39;s Qi is depleted, leading to delayed transformations. With heat in the stomach causing easy hunger and urgency for food, the spleen is damaged and unexercised, resulting in accumulated pain. Physicians still claim it to be vacuity accompanied by cold. This is not something that ordinary herbs and plants can treat; instead, they recklessly use substances to assist and complement the dry pills, focusing solely on consuming them. As time passes, both blood and fluids are depleted, leaving the stomach and intestines dry and desiccated.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>When the obstruction is above, near the throat, liquids can pass, but solid food is difficult to swallow; occasionally, it may go down, but not much, this is called &quot;choking.&quot; When the obstruction is below, near the stomach, food can enter, but it&#39;s hard to completely fill the stomach; after a while, it comes back up, this is called &quot;retention&quot; or &quot;reflux.&quot; If the stool is constipated and small, resembling sheep droppings, although the names differ, the illness originates from the same cause. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Yao Lue,&quot; there are six types of drinking issues: phlegm retention, suspended fluid, overflow fluid, obstructive fluid, retained fluid, and hidden fluid, each with different treatment methods related to the five organs, which are comprehensive and thorough. However, it is lamentable that practitioners do not manage treatments well, and patients do not adhere to restrictions, which leads to medication exacerbating the illness, causing a cycle of chronic conditions, drifting further from health—a situation truly worthy of sympathy. </p>
<p>Some say: &quot;In the &#39;Qian Jin&#39; recipes for treating retention, choking, and reflux, ginger and cinnamon have never been omitted; why then does my disciple speak so much?&quot; I respond: The stagnation and retention of qi, if left in the clear pathways for too long, cannot be resolved without the assistance of warming and aromatic herbs.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>There are indeed medicinal substances such as rhubarb, gypsum, bamboo shavings, glauber&#39;s salt, plantain, radix peucedani, (shiluo) salt, poria, yellow qi, reed root, and (grass tongue) loquat, which serve as assistants and facilitators. Their beginnings may be the same, but their ends vary. The disease&#39;s evil can easily lie dormant, hence it is easier to stabilize. Some inquire: can ancient formulas truly treat those suffering from dryness in the stomach? Are there other prompt methods or can we supplement what previous scholars have missed? I reply: the ancient formulas use ginseng to nourish the lung, rice to detoxify, bamboo juice to clear phlegm, dried ginger to nourish blood, corn to strengthen the stomach, honey water to moisten dryness, and ginger to eliminate impurities; this is precisely the intention. Zhang Jifeng also states: the sensation of obstruction in swallowing must be a disease of the spirit, and only through internal observation and self-nourishment can it be treated. This insight deeply understands the disease condition, and the treatment method aligns well with the principles. The condition of obstruction primarily relates to blood dryness. Blood is yin energy, which signifies stillness. When both the internal and external are still, the fire within the organs does not rise, allowing the dual energies of metal and water to nourish, leading to the spontaneous generation of yin blood. This ensures that the fluids of the intestines and stomach are properly transformed and harmonized—so how could there be any obstruction?<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Food Stasis</strong></p>
<p>Food stasis and esophageal obstruction are caused by phlegm being agitated by qi, and qi being obstructed by phlegm, leading to a blockage where phlegm and qi cannot flow freely. It is recommended to use Erchen Decoction with half a qian of Fructus Aurantii and Grains of Paradise, along with one qian of Saussurea. Alternatively, the Wuge Kuanzhong Powder may be used. This applies to symptoms of fullness and bloating, unjustified chest oppression, upward qi counterflow, or abdominal pain; it is also beneficial to use the Muxiang Liuqi Drink. For various cold pathogens in the chest, regardless of bloating or pain, it is good to administer one or two bowls of ginger juice, especially helpful for phlegm-damp retention. </p>
<p>When evil qi causes obstruction, it is advisable to use dispersing agents. If qi is not flowing smoothly and reverses to cause obstruction, this is classified as a deficiency obstruction. The more one tries to disperse it, the more it develops; thus, it is necessary to balance tonification with a subtle approach to dispersal without excessive use of aromatic agents. According to ancient prescriptions, after purging, for treatment of bloating, the principle of regulating the center applies.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Due to injury from the seven emotions, phlegm accumulates, causing pressure and fullness. One should take Siqi Decoction or Daotan Decoction with half a qian of Mu Xiang, or take Xia Lai Fu Dan. When cold qi is stagnant, causing fullness in the middle jiao, one can use Zhuapi Decoction with Clove, or Ding Chen Tou Ge Decoction. If there is food stagnation with corresponding symptoms, qi deficiency leads to counterflow and causes pain and fullness; in this case, take Liu Mo Drink or swallow He Xi Dan.</p>
<p>If fullness does not improve with various medicines, and there is not severe constipation, one should take Gan Ying Pill with Ba Dou, or prepare Han Liu Pill, Bei Ji Pill, or Mu Xiang Bing Lang Pill to relieve it.</p>
<p>For all forms of choking and obstruction, one should also take Wu Ge Kuan Zhong San. If this is ineffective, use Gu Shen Jia He San. Various medicines for previous fullness can also be chosen. If the obstruction is severe and neither liquids nor food can be ingested, and anything taken is immediately vomited, one should stabilize and settle this condition. It is advisable to take saltwater with Ling Sha Dan, and still use Jia He San in powdered form, taking it dry.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Reverse Stomach</strong></p>
<p>The reason the illness of reverse stomach is more serious than vomiting is that, while vomiting expels food immediately, reverse stomach may last for a day or more, with food returning undigested. The stomach does not lack the desire to eat, but is unwilling to retain food; the stomach&#39;s qi is cold and cannot digest, leading to undigested food not becoming waste and entering the large intestine, which must rise and be expelled from the mouth. Therefore, those with reverse stomach often have their chest and diaphragm oppressed by cold qi. For treatment, one may use Er Chen Decoction, adding ten grains of clove and half a qian of bitter orange peel, or Zhongzhi Decoction with half a qian each of bitter orange peel and sand seed, and one qian of half summer, boiled with rice and fresh ginger. </p>
<p>If the stomach is very cold and the patient vomits after taking medicine, it is advisable to use Aconite and glutinous rice soup with ten grains of clove and half a qian of sand seed; if there is constipation, add another half qian of bitter orange peel. If the oppression in the chest and diaphragm is severe and there is reverse stomach, it is suitable to use Gu Shen Jia He Powder, adding one qian of fresh Aconite, or use Ding Chen Tuo Ge Decoction or Wu Ge Kuan Zhong Powder, also adding one qian of fresh Aconite; furthermore, use Liufu Dan to regulate yin and yang and open the passage. Half-sulfur pill can also promote passage. Long-term blockage of the passage is termed colonic reverse stomach, and the half-sulfur pill is particularly suitable. </p>
<p>If all medicines prove ineffective and the condition is critical, one should use Gui Xiang Qing Jin Powder to induce a resolution. One method involves soaking pepper in vinegar, drying, and soaking it again, without counting the number of times; the more, the better. Grind it into rice powder, mix it with vinegar to form pills, and take ten pills with diluted vinegar soup, increasing to thirty or forty-nine.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan】</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Guange (Closed Position and Blockage)</strong></p>
<p>The classic states: When the Renying pulse is four times greater than the Qikou pulse, it is called &quot;ge&quot; (blockage); when the Qikou pulse is four times greater than the Renying pulse, it is called &quot;guan&quot; (closed position). The &quot;guan&quot; signifies that Yang does not descend, as cold is present in the chest, blocking its entry; &quot;ge&quot; signifies that Yin does not ascend, as heat is present in the lower jiao, blocking its exit. When the upper and lower parts do not communicate, the three jiaos become disordered, middle qi is insufficient, and Yin and Yang cannot nourish each other, hence it is both &quot;guan&quot; and &quot;ge.&quot; </p>
<p>For those with middle vacuity, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; with areca nut to adjust the rise and fall. For those with significant middle vacuity and phlegm accumulation, take &quot;Liujunzi Decoction&quot; minus the atractylodes, adding arborvitae seeds and a small amount of musk. For severe vacuity with vomiting and diarrhea where nothing can be retained, use &quot;Jijiu Pill.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Guange&quot; is slightly different from &quot;ye&quot; (obstruction). When there is a sensation of obstruction in the stomach, desire to ascend but unable, desire to descend but unable, desire to eat but unable, apply &quot;Erchen Decoction&quot; with houttuynia to expel the horizontal obstructive qi; it is not necessary to expel phlegm. </p>
<p>Ancient texts say: &quot;Guange deaths occur from morning to night, but treating the lower jiao can lead to recovery.&quot; The classics state: &quot;When the lesser yang channels are involved, it leads to vomiting, food not being retained, indicating that heat rises and causes vomiting; it is not solely caused by obstruction above, nor is it simply a &#39;ge.&#39; Use &quot;Dachengqi Decoction&quot; to purge it. If one vomits but cannot urinate, use &quot;Weiling Decoction.&quot; For damp-heat accumulation affecting the true water of the north, administer &quot;Zishen Pill.&quot; Avoid using diuretics that are bland and that facilitate water drainage. Any patient with &quot;guange&quot; presenting with head sweating has a fatal prognosis.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Esophageal Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When food cannot be ingested and there is constipation, it is called esophageal obstruction. The text states: &quot;Obstruction implies a rejection, that is, food returns to the stomach.&quot; The &quot;Jade Machine&quot; mentions that obstruction leads to constipation; thus, the remedy is &quot;Tongyou Decoction.&quot; Therefore, esophageal obstruction is the subject. The &quot;Jufang&quot; states that obstruction is close to the throat and the diaphragm is close to the stomach, while neglecting the lower burner, misguidedly dividing obstructive issues into ten diaphragm obstructions and five esophageal obstructions, all of which deviate from the principles found in classical texts. The cause of the disease stems from internal injuries due to worries, loss of will, and excessive indulgence in food and desires, which aggravate the fire of the spleen, stomach, liver, and kidneys; or it may arise from miscellaneous illnesses, due to the improper use of spicy and drying medicines, all leading to blood and fluids depleting, and the stomach becoming dry and withered. When this dryness occurs in the upper burner (at the cardia), food cannot descend, causing pain in the stomach, which persists until vomiting occurs to relieve the suffering. The cardia is the upper opening of the stomach, where food and drink rush in, and the qi is transmitted to the lungs. When the dryness is in the middle burner (at the pylorus), food can descend, but after a while, it is expelled. The pylorus is located near the center, indicating its obscure position, where food and drink enter the small intestine.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The condition in the lower burner, at the threshold, manifests as morning eating and evening vomiting, or evening eating and morning vomiting. The threshold regulates the water and grains beneath the navel, dividing them into the bladder and large intestine to form feces and urine. It is the pathway for the flow of qi, blood, and fluids of the small intestine, large intestine, and bladder. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;The three yangs that are congealed are called the diaphragm.&quot; When there is heat blockage in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; when there is heat blockage in the large intestine, one cannot have a bowel movement; when there is heat blockage in the bladder, the fluids become depleted. With the three yangs blocked by heat, the pulse must be vigorous and rapid, and there will be obstruction both before and after, with blockage below leading to a counter-flow upwards, thus causing food to be stuck and inability to swallow, resulting in regurgitation. This is due to the upward movement of yang fire without descending.</p>
<p>For real fire, use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction with added child&#39;s urine and ginger juice, or form into small pills with Yiyuan Powder mixed with clarified ginger juice, taking them regularly; Wenhui Six Pills are also particularly good. In severe cases, use Tao&#39;s Liuyi Chengqi Decoction or Ren Shen Li Ge Pill.</p>
<p>For empty fire surging upward causing food not to enter, use Zhiji Erchen Decoction with added Houpo, Baizhu, and a little Muxiang, or Gu Yu Lian Pills. For thirst, use Qian&#39;s Baizhu Powder.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>For those suffering from constipation, one should take &quot;Guide Stagnation and Open the Hidden Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Shen Ren Pill&quot; or &quot;Ma Zi Ren Pill.&quot; When experiencing a sensation of choking not yet reaching the diaphragm, it is advisable to take these as a precaution. Can one neglect ailments affecting the vital center? </p>
<p>Sometimes, the body receives cold air, or the mouth is hurt by cold substances, leading to diminished spleen and stomach fire, a feeling of bitterness and cold above the diaphragm, intestinal rumbling, and a pulse that must be slippery and weak; it is appropriate to temporarily use &quot;Clove Boiled Powder,&quot; &quot;Five Diaphragm Decoction,&quot; &quot;Five Choking Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Single Aconite Powder&quot; to alleviate this. If one does not seek the root cause and instead believes it to be merely cold, using pungent and drying medications indiscriminately will inevitably damage the yin without providing relief.</p>
<p>The ancients said: Choking in the diaphragm relates to the spirit, and only inner observation can nurture it. As emotions ignite fire, they evaporate fluids, generating phlegm and accumulation; prolonged accumulation leads to weakening blood. The &quot;Needle Classic&quot; states: When anger arises, food cannot descend properly; when fatigued energy arises, it results in choking, wheezing, and shortness of breath; when thinking too much, it leads to fullness in the center and obstruction in the triple warmer, causing difficulty in swallowing.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Phlegm and fluid retention, with a slippery or hidden pulse, can be treated with Er Chen Tang, Gu Shen Xia Tang, Hua Tan Wan, or (caltrop) Luo Shi Wan. Alternatively, one may use Huang Lian, Wu Yu, Bei Mu, (caltrop) Luo Ren, and Niu Zuan Cao, decocted in water. </p>
<p>For food accumulation, with a slippery and short pulse, Zhi Jun Wan can be enhanced with Huang Lian, Chen Pi, and Ban Xia, or treated with Gou Mi Ping Wei Wan or Hu Zhi Ping Wei Wan. Alternatively, one can use Bao He Wan (two qian), and add ginger-fried Huang Lian (three qian) and Shan Zha (two qian) to form pills, coated with Ma Ren Da Yan Zhi. For every sixty pills, steep in ginseng decoction, mixed with bamboo juice.</p>
<p>For emotional stagnation causing a deep and rough pulse, preferring stillness in food, and pain in the chest and back, use Si Qi Tang or Wen Dan Tang. If there is discomfort and slight cough with difficulty in urination, use Fen Xin Qi Yin or Si Mo Tang, or prepare a powder of equal parts Mu Xiang and Bing Lang to take with warm water. For those disturbed and unable to sleep, use Shi Wei Wen Dan Tang or Zhu Sha An Shen Wan. For abdominal distension and intestinal rumbling, use Mu Xiang Yun Qi San. In case of accumulation, employ A Wei Zhuang Qi Wan; for aversion to food odors, use Wu Ge Kuan Zhong San. </p>
<p>In cases of both qi and blood deficiency, with excessive salivation, the prognosis is poor.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>If there is a deficiency of qi that cannot manage and transform phlegm, the pulse will be slow and weak; use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is constipation, add reed root and child&#39;s urine; if the qi deficiency is severe, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with aconite and rhubarb; for alcohol toxicity, add sugarcane juice. The single ginseng decoction and ginseng paste are especially effective.</p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of blood that cannot nourish the body and generate fire, the pulse will be rapid and weak; use the Four Substance Decoction with child&#39;s urine, bamboo sap, and ginger juice. For constipation, add peach kernel and safflower; if there is stagnant blood, add peony root and leek juice; to prevent parasites, add donkey urine; if the blood deficiency is severe, add dried ginger; if the blood is dry, add cow or sheep milk. Human milk should not be used in place of this, because human milk may contain toxic fire from emotions and diet.</p>
<p>For those with both qi and blood deficiency, the Eight Substance Decoction is indicated.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>When the blood and yin are tranquil, both internally and externally, the fire of the organs does not rise, allowing the energies of metal and water to nourish. The yin blood will naturally thrive, and the fluids will transform and harmonize appropriately, so how can there be any obstruction or discomfort? </p>
<p>Generally, regardless of deficiency or excess, the focus should be on nourishing yin and supporting the stomach to prevent future issues, or the usage of Kidney Qi Pills. </p>
<p>A commonly used formula is Er Chen Tang with additions of children&#39;s urine, bamboo juice, ginger juice, and chive juice. If there is heat, add fried Qianlian, (chuan)lian, and Platycodon; for emotional disturbances, add Xiangfu, Chuanxiong, Muxiang, and Betel Nut. If digestion is poor, add malt and shenqu; if there is food stasis causing reverse flow, add Da Huang and Tao Ren. For qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Tang; for blood deficiency, use Si Wu Tang. </p>
<p>Miscellaneous prescriptions include Shou Zhen Wan, Chu Cang Wan, Zijing Ding, Xiatian Gao, Shenxian Duoming Dan, and Gu Awei San, or use Ling Sha with light wine. </p>
<p>Those over fifty with dried blood, whose stools resemble sheep dung, and younger individuals with heavy food intake or who have stopped sexual activities, should not be treated.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting</h3>
<p>For cold in the stomach causing blue vomiting, with cold extremities, and vomiting long after eating, use Erchen Decoction with added ginger and cinnamon, or Dingxiang Banxia Pill. </p>
<p>For heat in the stomach with a flushed face, warm extremities, and vomiting immediately after eating, use Erchen Decoction with stir-fried Scutellaria and gardenia. If severe, add betel nut and agarwood. For stomach pain, add ginger juice; alternatively, use Ge Gen Zhu Ru Decoction or a modified tangerine peel and bamboo shavings decoction, or Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with bamboo shavings. If there is frequent vomiting of clear water, leading to cold phlegm rising from below, this is caused by heat in the spleen. Use Erchen Decoction with white poria, white peony, Cimicifuga, stir-fried Scutellaria and gardenia, Shenqu, malt, and dried ginger in equal parts, either as pills or decoction.</p>
<p>For vomiting due to qi rising, causing chest pain, or forceful vomiting immediately after eating with thirst, one should first calm the qi and harmonize the middle. Use Six Gentleman Decoction with added agarwood, patchouli, platycodon, and loquat leaves, or Seven Qi Decoction. If it is heat qi rising, use Ancient Jinghuang Decoction with ginseng, licorice, and simmered ginger.</p>
<h3>Medical Canon Must-Reads</h3>
<p>【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi】<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Nausea and Dysphagia</strong></p>
<p>Nausea and dysphagia are fundamentally due to the depletion of blood and the dryness of the stomach. When dryness is in the upper part, fluids can pass, but food is difficult to enter, hence it is called dysphagia; when the dryness is in the lower part, food may enter but is later expelled after a long time, hence it is called nausea. Both conditions are generally referred to as &quot;the diaphragm,&quot; which is why the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; only mentions &quot;the diaphragm&quot; as a term for the three yang blockages. According to ancient texts, there are three kinds of vomiting: vomiting from the upper jiao is due to qi, where food leads to violent vomiting; vomiting from the middle jiao is due to accumulation, sometimes preceded by pain or followed by pain after vomiting; vomiting from the lower jiao is due to cold, where morning food is expelled in the evening and evening food in the morning. </p>
<p>Cao&#39;s school divides the symptoms into five types of dysphagia and ten types of diaphragm conditions, which makes the categorization overly complex and confusing. Only Zhang Jifeng suggests that such illness arises from within one&#39;s own contemplation and requires inner observation and quiet nurturing, which deeply resonates with the condition of illness. Generally speaking, the depletion of qi and blood, compounded by sadness, worry, and anger, injures the spleen and stomach, gradually depleting the blood, causing stagnant qi to generate phlegm, which then blocks and obstructs pathways, making it difficult for food and drink to enter—this results in dysphagia. When the spleen and stomach are weakly injured and lose their functions, they are unable to properly digest grains and transform them into essences. Thus, morning food is expelled in the evening and evening food in the morning; although food may enter the stomach, it will return and be rejected—this is how nausea arises. Both conditions occur in the area of the diaphragm, hence the common designation as &quot;the diaphragm.&quot; The vomiting associated with dysphagia corresponds to the upper jiao vomiting in ancient texts; the vomiting associated with nausea corresponds to the lower jiao vomiting. Wang Taibu states: if food cannot enter, it indicates the presence of heat; if food enters and then is expelled, it indicates the absence of heat.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Generally, obstruction and choking predominantly relate to heat, while nausea usually corresponds to cold. However, one should not be overly rigid in this approach. If the pulse is strong and large, one should treat it as heat; if the pulse is weak and small, it should be treated as cold. A yellowish-white complexion that appears withered indicates deficiency and cold; a reddish complexion that is lustrous indicates excess and heat. By correlating the pulse with symptoms and the complexion with the pulse, one can avoid errors. As the classics state: &quot;Those who can unite color and pulse can achieve completeness.&quot; The difficulty in diagnosing this condition arises because if one wishes to strengthen the spleen and regulate phlegm, there are concerns that drying agents may hinder body fluids; if one wishes to nourish blood and generate fluids, there is worry that moistening agents may obstruct the middle. One should carefully assess whether there is injury to yin with excessive fire, in which case nourishing blood should be prioritized; or if there is spleen injury with excess yin, warming and tonifying should come first.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>There are also concerns of distress and blockage, with fire stagnating and unable to disperse. The spirit is not greatly weakened, and the pulse still has strength. One should use the methods of Cang Gong and He Jian to treat it. A small amount of medicinal pills should be used repeatedly, and the blockage will naturally resolve itself. If phlegm in the diaphragm is excessive and subtly surging, one should treat it with downward medication; the efficacy of the medicine will easily take effect. If for some reason it does not work, one can guide the treatment with honey and salt, which will help to naturally open up the channels. All of this is a distinction between the vacuous and the solid, the yin and the yang, and is crucial in the balance during diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Some may become stuck on texts like the &quot;Jinkui&quot; or &quot;Jufang,&quot; overly favoring pungent warming methods, while others may get fixated on the &quot;Yuji&quot; or &quot;Xinfang,&quot; favoring clear and moistening treatments. Such tendencies rely on the appropriateness of the illness and the treatment, rather than adhering strictly to a method of treating the illness.</p>
<p>For any symptoms of reflux that improve with medication, one must not immediately provide congee or rice. Instead, use five qian of ginseng, two qian of dried tangerine peel, and one liang of aged rice to make a soup for delicate sipping. Only after ten days can congee be offered. If the storehouse (the body) has not been sufficiently strengthened, it is inappropriate to introduce grains, as it often leads to ineffective treatment.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p>
<h3>Death Certificate</h3>
<p>Those who reach the age of sixty are difficult to treat. However, if they are of robust health, adhere to prohibitions, and trust in medicine, there may be some who survive. Those with stools resembling sheep droppings cannot be treated, and those who foam at the mouth cannot be treated. Those with chest and abdominal pain as if cut by a knife will die.</p>
<h3>Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>A tight and slippery pulse indicates vomiting; a small, weak, and slippery pulse suggests reverse stomach action. A deep, slow, and weak pulse, or a large but weak pulse, indicates Qi deficiency; a rapid and weak pulse, or a thin and weak pulse, indicates blood deficiency. A wiry pulse indicates phlegm, as does a slippery pulse. A tight pulse at the inch and a weak pulse at the cubit indicates fullness in the chest, leading to inability to eat and subsequent vomiting. Furthermore, the &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: when the pulse is leathery, it signifies vomiting.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Food Obstruction</h3>
<p>The terms food obstruction, reversed stomach, and closed gates are distinct, the causes are entirely different, and treatment should be differentiated; one must discern them. Food obstruction occurs when one is hungry and desires food but experiences blockage in the throat and chest area, above the stomach. It has not yet entered the stomach, and mucus and saliva come out. Once it enters the stomach, nothing fails to digest and nothing returns. This condition is primarily found in older men; the young do not experience food obstruction. Reversed stomach occurs when food intake is excessive but ends with the morning meal being vomited in the evening, or the evening meal being vomited in the morning, or vomiting occurring after one or two meals, or after accumulating for a day and night, leading to unbearable bloating in the abdomen and subsequent vomiting of the original substances in an undigested, sour, and foul state. This means that it has entered the stomach and is now being expelled, hence it is called reversed stomach. This condition can occur in men and women of all ages.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>The condition known as &quot;Guan Ge&quot; is described as being unable to eat even a grain of rice; when thirsty, one prefers to drink tea or water, but soon feels the need to expel it. Repeated attempts to drink lead to further expulsion. When taking medicine, hot medicine is immediately rejected, and cold medicine takes a longer time to be expelled. There is also constipation, referred to as Guan Ge. &quot;Guan&quot; means that substances cannot exit the lower part, while &quot;Ge&quot; indicates that substances cannot enter the upper part. This condition is often seen in women.</p>
<p>Regarding the obstruction caused by food in the throat, Danxi claims it arises from the seven emotions and six desires, leading to a transformation of heat rising and a lack of descent. This causes a buildup of phlegm and fluid, providing temporary relief during moments of discomfort, only to resurge soon after. When previous medicines are taken again, they accumulate heat, and blood and fluid become depleted, leading to a dry and withered state in the stomach area. When dryness occurs near the throat, water can pass through, but food is difficult to consume, leading to a condition known as &quot;Yè&quot; or obstruction. If this dryness is located nearer to the stomach, food can enter but is hard to retain, leading to a long delay before it exits the body, referred to as &quot;Ge&quot; or reversed stomach. Bowel movements are infrequent, resembling the consistency of sheep feces.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>One must avoid the six excesses externally and regulate the seven emotions internally. By nurturing oneself with appropriate food and drink to nourish the blood and generate fluids, the body will be free from the flames of heat, the kidneys will gradually produce water, and when the qi is clear and the blood is harmonious, the spleen will function well, allowing for the digestion and transformation of food. </p>
<p>Danxi&#39;s discussions are quite clever, but his explanations about choking and reversed stomach conditions lack clarity. I particularly appreciate his idea of the fiery transformation rising up and the kidneys gradually producing water, as it keenly identifies the source of illness. However, I regret that his understanding remains somewhat superficial; he emphasizes nourishing the blood but does not directly explore the original essence within the kidneys. Therefore, his treatment methods involve formulas rich in animal milk, along with substances like bamboo sap and leek juice, which resolve phlegm and stasis but address only the symptoms rather than the root cause.</p>
<p>Does one not understand that the &quot;Neijing&quot; originally does not have much discourse but simply states that the three yang conditions signify a blockage? The three yang refer to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder, and blockage signifies heat accumulation. The large intestine governs fluids, while the small intestine governs liquids. If there is heat accumulation in the large intestine, fluids are depleted; if there is heat accumulation in the small intestine, liquids dry up. The bladder is the governing official of the region, storing fluids. If there is heat accumulation in the bladder, the fluids are exhausted.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>However, how does the &quot;Three Yangs&quot; lead to heat accumulation? All of it is due to kidney disease. The kidneys govern the five bodily fluids and regulate both urination and defecation; they are considered one organ with the bladder. When kidney water is depleted and yang fire becomes excessive, it boils the fluids, resulting in heat accumulation of the &quot;Three Yangs.&quot; This leads to blockage both anteriorly and posteriorly, causing difficulties in excretion; hence, it must counteract upward, impacting the pathways of clarity, and overflows into the throat, causing difficulty in swallowing food. </p>
<p>Why can water be ingested while food is hard to swallow? Food enters the yin aspect and nourishes the yang, which elevates the fire in the stomach, making it hard to intake; water, being more yin in nature, resonates well and thus can be ingested. When one spits white foam, it is due to the water they consumed boiling and rising. When feces resemble sheep droppings, it indicates that little food has been consumed, and the residue has been fully absorbed, resulting in dry and narrow intestines.</p>
<p>These symptoms are often found in men over the age of fifty who have developed such conditions externally. Moreover, such individuals usually do not curb their desires. If inquiring about the cause, they might shy away from discussing their ailments and instead cite recent emotional distress, experiencing much stagnation as a result. It is my belief that this stagnation certainly exists, and they may indulge in activities to alleviate their worries, which is often the case, perhaps 80 to 90 percent of the time, and it may not require further elaboration.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>However, the old man&#39;s innocence has long disappeared, leaving only the solitary yang, focusing primarily on nourishing yin. Wang Taifu said: If food is ingested and then vomited, it indicates a lack of water; if food is retained for a long time and then expelled, it indicates a lack of fire. A lack of water hinders the mastery of water, and a lack of fire diminishes the source of fire. Zhu Shizhong stated: To treat an upper ailment, one must use large doses of Liuwei Dihuang pill decocted for drinking; long-term use can recover roughly one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is also necessary to abstain from indulging desires, avoiding certain rooms, and maintaining a bland diet. If one claims to warm the stomach, the stomach is inherently not cold; if one claims to tonify the stomach, the stomach is not deficient; if one claims to alleviate stagnation, aromatic and dry items should not assist fire. The &quot;Jufang Feihua&quot; already has clear explanations, stating that Liu from Hejian uses purgative methods which can damage the stomach with excessive cold, leading to further depletion of fluids. There&#39;s no remedy like nourishing yin, which extinguishes the flame. The common people do not understand, and thus I elaborate in detail.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Regarding vomiting, the &quot;Essentials from the Golden Chamber&quot; states: If the pulse at the Fuyang point is superficial and weak, being superficial indicates deficiency, and being weak harms the spleen. If the spleen is harmed, digestion does not occur, leading to morning nausea and evening vomiting, or evening meals resulting in morning vomiting, with undigested food, a condition known as vomiting. </p>
<p>I came across a medical case in historical texts stating that a patient with vomiting had undigested food coming up until the next morning. The doctor administered warming gastric medicine, but it was ineffective, and the pulse was very faint and weak. A national expert examined the case and noted that the medicines used were not addressing the patient&#39;s condition effectively, leaving the doctor perplexed. </p>
<p>Reading Dong Yuan’s writings, it is stated that vomiting has three causes: accumulation of qi, cold, and cold in the lower region. Upper jiao vomiting is due to qi, middle jiao vomiting is due to accumulation, and lower jiao is due to cold. In this case, the pulse is deep and slow, with morning nausea and evening vomiting, and small bowel movements but constipation. This indicates lower jiao vomiting. The treatment should focus on relieving the blockage and warming the cold. Therefore, we specifically treat the lower jiao, dispelling the cold, and gradually harmonizing with middle jiao remedies to promote recovery. </p>
<p>From this, we see that lower jiao vomiting is due to weakened fire at the gate of life, like a pot without fuel, unable to simmer the fluids and food in the stomach, leading to bloating and inevitable vomiting.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>The so-called prolonged consumption leading to depletion is indeed a lack of fire. One must utilize the original source of beneficial fire, first supplementing the Mingmen fire with Bawei Dihuang Wan to support the Earth of the Spleen, and then gradually using Fuzhu to administer the Lichong Decoction to regulate the interior, ensuring everything is well taken care of. Not understanding this, one merely uses hawthorn or Shenqu to flatten the stomach and digest food, which only hastens demise.</p>
<p>Regarding the condition of &quot;Guan Ge,&quot; it arises suddenly and manifests as a violent illness. Symptoms include constipation, thirst for water, occasional vomiting, alternating between drinking and vomiting, dry lips, slightly red eyes, and either a flushed or unflushed face. In severe cases, there may be chest pain or not, while the patient loses all desire to eat from the onset of illness, unable to swallow even a drop of water, and vomiting half a cup after drinking one. After several days, the pulse becomes submerged. This cold enters from the Shaoyin Kidney channel, with Yin flourishing below and pushing Yang upward, known as the symptom of &quot;Ge Yang,&quot; termed &quot;Guan Ge.&quot; Those with Guan Ge cannot use their full vitality and may die.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>One should use Zhang Jing&#39;s Bai Tong Decoction, following the method of using cold due to heat as stated in the Inner Canon. The text says: If one adjusts the contra-reversals of cold and heat, then the cold will surely act on the hot substances. After swallowing, once the cold nature is removed, the heat nature will begin to manifest, leading to the resolution of the illness, and vomiting will cease, thereby bringing significant benefits without any adverse effects. This combines the human urine and the bile of pigs, which are salty, bitter, and cold in nature, into the Bai Tong Decoction. The qi must correspond to one another to dispel the cold that obstructs. If the pulse gradually emerges after taking the medicine, life is likely; if the pulse suddenly emerges, death is imminent. Tao Jie&#39;an&#39;s &quot;Kai Che Chui&quot; contains a remarkable recipe for &quot;Hui Yang Fan Ben Decoction.&quot; After recovery, one should regularly take the Ba Wei Pill to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a type of liver fire condition where vomiting occurs but nothing can be retained; the vomit consists of sour water, bitter water, or blue-green water, while bowel movements remain normal. It can also cause heart pain. This is a case of stagnant fire and wood. The stagnation of wood must be resolved and the fire released. One should use a concentrated decoction of Fructus Ziziphi Jujubae and Radix Gentianae, sipping it slowly. Then take Xiao Yao San for recovery. After recovery, one should use the Liu Wei Wan for regulation.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>The Laws of Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Yu Chang (Qing Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Theory of Closing the Cadres</strong></p>
<p>The proof of closing the cadres is deeply discussed in the &quot;Ling,&quot; &quot;Su,&quot; and &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; as well as in Zhongjing&#39;s pulse methodology, yet there are no established methods for it. Later generations, lacking concrete methods to rely upon, have been left with abstract discussions of subtle meanings without thorough research, merely preserving its name for a long time. Occasionally, some, without the guidance of a master, formulate prescriptions based on their own understanding and pass them down in texts, but they remain as fleeting gold dust in their eyes, unsuitable for practical use. What can one do about this? I humbly express this with a respectful discussion of the underlying principles. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the manifestation of a major illness in the lesser yang is represented by one sign, in the greater yang by two, in the yangming by three, and anything beyond that is classified as closing the yang; in the cun-kou (pulse), a major illness in the jueyin is shown by one sign, in the shaoyin by two, in the taiyin by three, and anything beyond that is classified as closing the yin.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>When the pulse at the Renying and the Cun position is strong, if it exceeds four times, it indicates a blockage. A weakened pulse at the blockage cannot reach the essence of the universe and will lead to death. This is related to the three Yang organs and the three Yin organs, which are diagnosed at the positions next to the throat&#39;s Renying, and at the positions of the hands&#39; Cun and Taiyuan. The needling methods are applied according to the flow of the Renying and Cun meridians. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that acupuncture should address the excess Yang by draining it and supplementing the corresponding Yin, employing two drainages and one supplementation. Similarly, for the Cun, excess Yin is drained while supplementing the corresponding Yang, also using two drainages and one supplementation, all of which should cease when the Qi is harmonized. Regarding herbal treatment, it is important to assess the pulses at the wrists&#39; Cun, Guan, and Chi positions to differentiate the Yin and Yang of the organs. Therefore, the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; further states that when pathology is in the organs, the Yang pulse is out of harmony; when the Yang pulse is out of harmony, Qi stagnates, and when Qi stagnates, Yang Qi becomes excessive. If Yang Qi becomes too abundant, the Yin pulse will be out of harmony; when the Yin pulse is out of harmony, blood stagnates, and when blood stagnates, Yin Qi becomes excessive.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>When the yin qi is too abundant, the yang qi cannot thrive; thus it is called a &quot;barrier.&quot; When the yang qi is too abundant, the yin qi cannot thrive; thus it is called a &quot;block.&quot; When both yin and yang are abundant, they cannot nurture each other; hence it is referred to as a &quot;barrier-block.&quot; A barrier-block cannot allow one to die at a predetermined time. This is the balance used in medicine, determining treatment according to the pulse&#39;s measurements of excessive yin and yang. The people of Yue regard this as significant, expressing it as a pulse where yin dominates over yang. They interpret excess yang as being like overflow and entry as coverage, depicting the phenomenon of yin and yang being skewed and unable to revert accurately. Later, Zhongjing established three major principles: he stated that a floating and large pulse at the cun position indicates emptiness, while the size indicates solidity; at the chi position, it is a barrier, and at the cun, it is a block. If there is a barrier, one cannot urinate easily, and with a block, there may be vomiting. By examining both hands at the cun position, determining the balance between excessive yin and yang, and observing whether they are floating or large, one can ascertain if there is deficiency in yang or excess in yin, or vice versa, to apply treatment.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>In the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it is stated that when Yang is excessively strong, Yin cannot thrive; when Yin is excessively strong, Yang cannot thrive. Furthermore, the methods of the Yue people concerning Yin and Yang, coupled with the distinctions of vacuity and substance, lead to a clear understanding of reality. Without this, the conditions will be firmly categorized as Yin or Yang. But from whence can one discern the subtle nuances? This is one principle: when the heart pulse is ample and long, it indicates the essence of the heart’s pulse. If the upper pulse is slight and the head small, sweating occurs; if the lower pulse is large, then obstruction results, and urination cannot take place. If there is no sweating in the head, treatment is possible; if sweating occurs, death follows. This clearly illustrates the source of the obstruction, which stems from the fire of the five emotions being trapped within the heart&#39;s membrane. The upper pulse appearing slight with a small head indicates Yang deficiency, while the lower pulse appearing large indicates Yang excess. If there is no sweating in the head, treatment is feasible; if there is sweating, the heart’s essence is lost, leading to self-immolation. In cases of the two Yang conditions affecting the heart and spleen, there can be no hidden curves; men may have diminished essence, and women may be without their monthly cycle, resulting in transmitted conditions that vanish without remedy.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>The condition of &quot;guan ge&quot; is characterized by exhaustion of vital energy, deterioration of the body&#39;s form, separation from and obstruction of essence, and the feelings of sorrow, fear, and anger. The five internal organs become empty, energy and blood are detached, while the fire of the yang essence moves independently. This affects the heart and spirit, all contained within a tiny space, where the chances of life and death are exceedingly close—how can one not carefully discern it? These are the two methods. It refers to the presence or absence of the &quot;fu yang&quot; pulse; when it is suppressed, it leads to regurgitation, and food and drink cannot be digested. When it is weak, no food can even enter, which is called &quot;guan ge.&quot; By diagnosing the &quot;fu yang&quot; pulse at the foot, one can determine whether it is suppressed or weak, which reveals the state of the stomach&#39;s qi. If suppressed, it indicates that food and drink enter but do not digest; if weak, it shows that no food can enter, revealing the state of the stomach&#39;s qi even further. When the flow of nourishment and defenses is slow, and the intake of food and drink is scarce, while the central system is not functioning, how could one wait for further explanation? These are the three methods. The refined techniques of Zhang Zhongjing, through the &quot;golden needle,&quot; provide insights through these three methods; fundamentally, they are concerned with the state of deficiency.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Given this text spans ancient and modern times, it searches through various opinions, and among renowned scholars and sages, none discuss this evidence, only mentioning that Qizi described the conditions of yin and yang being opposed, transmitting what he tested across nine regions. This is akin to navigating the seas for thousands of miles, finding a companion with whom to share a harmonious voice, bringing unmatchable joy, yet one cannot consider it a shortcoming. However, one does not wish future generations to settle comfortably into these views, nor can one bear to remain silent. It is said that when yin and yang shift places, the condition is termed as &quot;blockage.&quot; If yang energy is consistently present in the chest, it leads to heat as the primary illness; if yin energy is consistently present below the waist, it leads to cold as the primary illness. If there is cold in the chest, one should treat it with heat; if there is heat in the lower dantian, one should treat it with cold. If there is a combination of cold and heat in the chest, treatment should be based on the primary and secondary principles. The treatment for the primary condition should be gentle, while treatment for the secondary condition should be urgent. This stems from the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; where cold is present in the chest and heat in the lower dantian, asserting the viewpoint that is indeed not necessarily linked to blockage as a fundamental condition. The method of treating primary and secondary conditions referenced from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; also lacks a solid basis.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>As for the texts of &quot;Ling,&quot; &quot;Su,&quot; &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; and &quot;Jin Gui,&quot; they are utterly incomprehensible. The established prescriptions have been muddled into the poor practices of later generations, and upon examination, they are quite displeasing to the ear. </p>
<p>In the formulas, there are minor flaws, such as the mixed use of Ban Xia, Wu Ling, Zhi Ke, Hou Po, Bing Lang, and Mu Xiang. The major flaws involve the mixed use of Pian Nao, She Xiang, Fu Zi, Zao Jiao, Qian Niu, Da Huang, and Shi Bo Nitrate. </p>
<p>Can it be said that yin and yang do not intersect, each creating its own bias, while yin is claimed to be above and yang below? Can the vital signs of near-death be seized and dictated by dominant techniques influencing yin and yang? </p>
<p>By using Fu Yang as a diagnostic tool, Zhang Jing aimed for harmony in the guarding and nutritive Qi, seeking neither bias toward yin nor toward yang, advocating for a balanced approach without confrontation, allowing the stomach&#39;s Qi to naturally assert itself. From one to nine, and then to eight, seven, four, and six, one may begin to achieve equilibrium. Can this be accomplished in one stroke? </p>
<p>Thus, regardless of how to initiate treatment or the means by which it is communicated, all should seek from within, grasp the pivot and maneuver, gradually penetrating from top to bottom, waiting for the Fu Yang pulse to neither collapse nor weaken. When nutritive Qi moves forward, attention is added to it; when guarding Qi moves forward, attention is added to it, leading efforts in accordance with their momentum, so as not to conflict with the medicines.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>When the nutritive and protective energies are harmoniously connected, one should seek to balance them. The protective energy, when in harmony, should also be sought for balance. In pursuit of life, one should rejoice in accomplishments; how can one not desire this when overwhelmed by restlessness? The practice of seeking life within death requires individuals who are experienced in navigating such circumstances. </p>
<p>To address loss, one must first extinguish the flames of the five emotions. To treat reflux, one must gradually address it from the interior and allow it to surface; to manage urinary obstruction, one must likewise address it from within and allow it to manifest below. Treatment requires an understanding of both the channels and the points, moving gradually from the interior to influence both upper and lower concerns. </p>
<p>The saying goes: &quot;If the moxa of three years is not retained, one cannot escape death; if retained, one can avoid death.&quot; Why then should people not practice retention? Some might be ill, and I do not propose a singular approach, for those who lack understanding of treatable methods may remain perpetually ineffective. In dire situations, one may reluctantly resort to a formula involving huanglian, but that should not become the standard approach for the average person.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Prescription of Huanglian Decoction for Ingress and Egress</strong></p>
<p>Huanglian Decoction is a formula from Zhongjing for treating typhoid fever. When there is heat in the chest,邪气 in the stomach, and pain in the abdomen with a desire to vomit, Huanglian Decoction is the primary remedy. The邪气 in the stomach obstructs the mechanism of ascent and descent of yin and yang, preventing them from interacting with the middle earth. Thus, yin cannot rise and becomes trapped below, causing cold pain in the lower abdomen; yang cannot descend and remains solely in the upper body, leading to heat in the chest and a desire to vomit. </p>
<p>This decoction indeed facilitates the proper ascent and descent of yin and yang. However, for those with dampness, a tongue that resembles a fetus, heat in the dantian, and cold in the chest, can this formula still be used? Later generations have forced interpretations that fail to capture the essence of the formula, yet how can they modify the prescription? Typhoid fever is typically divided into three treatments: exterior, interior, and central. When both exterior and interior邪气 are strong, one should harmonize from the center, which is why there is the harmonizing method of Xiao Chaihu Decoction, combining Ren Shen, Gan Cao, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao to support the stomach, while adding one ingredient of Chaihu to facilitate the exterior and one ingredient of Huangqin to penetrate the interior.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>There is still a fear that the essence may be insufficiently exposed, which can be detrimental to harmony. Thus, after removing the dregs, it is repeatedly boiled without distinction, and when consumed, it enters the stomach. The ascending stomach qi carries Chai Hu to the exterior, while the descending stomach qi brings Huang Qin inward. When they harmonize, the evils from both interior and exterior are dispelled; if any remain, they should be treated accordingly, without any conflict.</p>
<p>As for the evils within the lower dantian and the chest, they are situated above and below and are not considered exterior or interior. Therefore, one should transform Chai Hu Decoction into Huang Lian Decoction to harmonize these areas. Replace Chai Hu with Gui Zhi, Huang Qin with Huang Lian, and fresh ginger with dried ginger. When consumed, it is also important to monitor the upward and downward movements of the stomach qi, allowing for treatment regardless of whether the upper part is hot and the lower part is cold, or vice versa.</p>
<p>For exterior and interior evils, Chai Hu and Huang Qin should be used; for upper and lower evils, Gui Zhi and Huang Lian are applied. To dispel exterior evils, fresh ginger&#39;s pungency is used; for upper and lower evils, the spiciness of dried ginger is employed. The methods of Zhang Zhongjing are indeed profound. If one wishes to engage in the methods of promoting or retreating the upper and lower, what technique should one use? In previous discussions, these were sought through the middle, grasping the pivot and moving it, gradually penetrating from above and below, waiting for the ying qi to be fully communicated and the wei qi to be fully obtained for advancement or retreat. However, this aspect is difficult to articulate. If there is obstruction, there might be regurgitation; thus, using this method is appropriate. After all, the sun (Tai Yang) governs opening; if the sun does not open, there will be obstruction in the chest, preventing food from being ingested, which would either be refused entry or expelled again. Therefore, using Gui Zhi as the medicinal agent of the Tai Yang channel harmonizes ying and wei qi and facilitates the Yang pathway, thus enabling the opening.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>As for the five emotions and the yang fire rising, the use of cinnamon twig (gui zhi) is no longer appropriate; if used, it will lead to fire assisting fire, causing sweating from the head and the escape of yang, thus preventing urination. The method of retreating relies on the stomach qi penetrating into the yin segment, hence cinnamon twig should not be utilized. However, if the stomach&#39;s gate is already closed, the lesser yin governs closure, and the qi of the lesser yin does not rise, the stomach’s gate cannot open. Chang Yi stated that the pulse of the lesser yin is deep and stagnant, while that of the foot yang is prone and slack—both are causes for concern. The Nei Jing often reiterates this: when the kidney qi is solely deep, it is said to be unbalanced. The true qi in the kidney is akin to a balance scale; if there is both weight and balance, the gate opens and closes at intervals; if there is weight but no balance, the gate is closed and cannot open. How then can the small urine be released? Thus, the kidney qi pill embodies all matters of retreating. When the kidney qi connects with the stomach, the gate opens; when it connects with the heart, the yang fire proceeds to descend, making it sometimes unavoidable to use. Advance and retreat must follow this order; is this something an average person can discern?<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>In the treatment of obstructive diseases, if one does not know how to differentiate between suppression and promotion, but only hopes to stop vomiting and improve urination, hastily addressing the superficial symptoms, then exhausting all efforts without benefit is the fault of the physician. In treating obstructive diseases, if one does not consider the three pulses—Renying, Fuyang, and Taichong—and focuses solely on the inch pulse, this is already a gross oversight. If one also lacks clarity in distinguishing between the yin and yang aspects of the inch pulse, this is the fault of the physician.</p>
<p>In treating obstructive diseases, if one does not discern the differences between yang deficiency and fullness, or yin deficiency and fullness, and administers treatment blindly, like a blind person on a road without knowing east from west, this is the fault of the physician. In treating obstructive diseases, if one does not adhere to noble principles and instead employs forceful techniques to flaunt their abilities, pushing the patient toward death, this is the fault of the physician.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Medical Section, Volume 313</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yue Ge and Counter-Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jingyue&#39;s Complete Works</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jiebin]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Guan Ge</strong></p>
<p>The condition of &quot;guan ge&quot; is illustrated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which discusses the pulse patterns to reveal the dangers of the separation of Yin and Yang. This is evident from discussions found in various sections such as the &quot;Six Seasonal Organs,&quot; &quot;Beginning and End,&quot; &quot;Prohibitions on Medicines,&quot; and discussions regarding pulse measurements and meridians. Since these insights are so significant, we can understand their weight.</p>
<p>Originating from the writings of the Qin dynasty&#39;s Yue people, there are three difficulties mentioned: &quot;Upper fish&quot; indicates overflow, signifying the external blockage in &quot;guan&quot;; &quot;Inner measurement&quot; indicates overturning, signifying the internal blockage in &quot;ge.&quot; Discussing &quot;guan ge&quot; in these terms has strayed from their original meaning in the canon.</p>
<p>Moreover, Zhongjing states: at the pulse point of the &quot;chi&quot; (尺) is &quot;guan,&quot; while at the pulse point of the &quot;cun&quot; (寸) is &quot;ge.&quot; If &quot;guan&quot; is affected, urination is impaired; if &quot;ge,&quot; then there is vomiting and regurgitation. Thus, from the time of Shuhe and Dongyuan onwards, this understanding has been tradition, and eventually, the notion of &quot;guan ge&quot; has been lost entirely.</p>
<p>Later, Danxi mentioned: this condition often leads to death. Cold is located above and heat below, with the pulse in both &quot;cun&quot; points being four times stronger than normal; the treatment should involve emesis to elevate the horizontal stagnation of Qi without needing to expel phlegm.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>I foolishly argue that if both the cun and the two-inch pulse are four times strong, how can we then say that it indicates cold in excess? Moreover, if the pulse is large like this, it is floating and has no root, its emptiness is evident; how can it be expelled? This is erroneous and indeed the worst error! The Inner Classic states that the renying pulse can be four times strong, and the cunkou pulse can also be four times; these are not to be taken literally about their size, but rather indicate an expulsion of food stagnation; to say one cannot urinate indicates urinary retention. Each of these two conditions has its own criteria, and how does it relate to the diagnosis of guangu? This is true for you students—why should it be different in other cases? How can we then expect those who treat such conditions to be free from error?</p>
<p>The guangu diagnosis in the Inner Classic is originally examined through the renying pulse for the yang of the six fu organs, and the cunkou pulse examines the yin of the five zang organs. When the renying pulse is exceedingly strong, exceeding four times, this indicates the solitary yang of the yangming channel; the water does not assist the fire, hence it is termed gu阳. Gu阳 refers to the yin being constrained by the yang. When the cunkou pulse is exceedingly strong, exceeding four times, this indicates that the ta阴 channel has no main yin, and the qi does not return to the essence, hence it is termed gu阴. Gu阴 refers to the yang intervening with the yin. If both the renying and cunkou pulses are strong to the level of four times or more, both large and numerous, this indicates that the yang qi does not accumulate, thus there is no yang within the yin, and the yin qi does not rise, hence there is no yin within the yang; yin and yang are separated, hence it is named guangu.</p>
<p>All those who observe this condition are generally affected by excessive drinking and indulgence, and emotional desires harm the essence; thus, the yang cannot maintain its residence, leading to a floating pulse that is exposed and excessively strong. This signifies the true yin being depleted and the yuan sea having no root, which genuinely reflects the image of a dragon soaring high with regrets, indicating the utmost danger in prognosis.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; uses the pulse at the inch and the renying to diagnose, but in later generations, practitioners only use the inch and neglect the renying, indicating that the method is incomplete. The inch pulse is the major representation of the pulse, and when the pulse is discerned there, it will also appear in the other; hence, by observing the inch, the pulse of the renying can also be generally seen. Therefore, whenever the inch pulse is extremely large, even four times its expected size, and both large and numerous, it indicates a pulse of guan ge, which should not be mistaken for a fire condition. I have diagnosed several individuals with this pulse, and upon observation, it felt like a string or leather, abnormally large—hence I say four times. Observing its symptoms, the pulse movement corresponds with body movement, particularly noticeable in the voids beneath the breasts and in the motions around the navel; all appear active and resonant, responding with the pulse. In examining its form and energy, there is slight wheezing above, and upon movement, the wheezing intensifies. The limbs lack strength, and there are frequent states of anxiety during wakefulness and sleep, leading one to deem it a deficiency without cough or blood loss symptoms, or if judged to be phlegm-fire, it lacks signs of a true pathogenic heat. This is what differentiates guan ge. However, only wealthy individuals and those with a robust physique tend to exhibit these symptoms.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>To seek the cause, it is nothing but an excess of pleasure in the youthful and middle years, with wine and lust as the culprits. Although this differs from the symptoms of overstrain, it is indeed another name for it. Therefore, those of mature age should be cautious! </p>
<p>The &quot;Classic on Pulse Diagnosis&quot; states: When yin qi is too abundant, yang qi cannot flourish, hence it is called &#39;Guan&#39; (Barrier); when yang qi is too abundant, yin qi cannot flourish, hence it is called &#39;Ge&#39; (Obstruction). When both yin and yang are robust and cannot support each other, it is also called &#39;Guan Ge&#39;. The state of &#39;Guan Ge&#39; means one cannot reach a timely death. This addresses pulse symptoms comprehensively. </p>
<p>If one speaks in terms of pulse, it resembles the prior four-fold conditions. If one speaks in terms of symptoms, there are cases where both yin and yang are vigorous, with a yang condition extreme in its yang aspect and a yin condition extreme in its yin aspect. </p>
<p>In general, when yang is exceeding in yang, one should proceed to purge, yet if the yin aspect reveals itself, it cannot be purged; when yin is extreme in yin, one should proceed to replenish, yet if the yang aspect reveals itself, it cannot be replenished. In such instances, yang exists solely in the yang without any yin, and yin exists solely in the yin without any yang. They are isolated, unable to interact, and thus cannot be supplemented nor purged. This is also a symptom of &#39;Guan Ge&#39; and leads to death. </p>
<p>This is significantly different from the symptoms of true cold with false heat or true heat with false cold—students should distinguish between the similar yet different manifestations. </p>
<p>Discussion on treatment.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The pulse of the &quot;Guan Ge&quot; must be extremely taut. The tautness represents a deficiency in the middle, while the floating and large indicate a deficiency in yin. This pulse indicates severe depletion of kidney water, where yang is present but yin is lacking. Those treating this condition should primarily focus on strongly replenishing the true yin. Additionally, one must observe the cold and heat within the deficiency, as well as the balance of yin and yang, and treat accordingly for optimal results.</p>
<p>In &quot;Guan Ge&quot; syndrome, if there is a combination with yang organs, there will be excess heat, so treatments like Yinxian Decoction, Left Kidney Decoction, and Left Kidney Pill should be administered. If there is a combination with yin organs, there will be excess cold, thus treatments like Great Harmony Decoction, Right Kidney Decoction, and Right Kidney Pill should be used. If there is neither heat nor cold, and the organ&#39;s energy is fundamentally balanced, then Five Blessings Decoction, Three Yin Decoction, and Great Yuan Supplementing Decoction should be prescribed.</p>
<p>In cases of &quot;Guan Ge&quot; syndrome, if the underlying damage is severe, medications and food must not be neglected. For those with essence deficiency, support should be provided for their essence; for those with qi deficiency, support should be given for their qi. If there are complex conditions that are difficult to detail, one should select appropriate prescriptions from ancient and modern supplementation methods, as these are the true methods of treatment. However, it is essential to reside in a separate, peaceful space to cultivate tranquility and clarity of heart over time for complete recovery. If one does not avoid human interactions and only relies on medications while ignoring appropriate adjustments, there is a fear of extreme fluctuations that may yield no effective results. Those suffering from this condition must not be unaware!<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Inspissation and Phlegm Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In the case of inspissation, it is definitely formed due to excessive sorrow, worry, accumulated labor, pent-up emotions, or harm from excessive indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures. Excessive worry and thought lead to qi stagnation; when qi is stagnant, transformation doesn’t occur. Excessive indulgence injures the yin, and if the yin is harmed, essence and blood dry up. If qi stagnates, there arises an upper syndrome of inspissation; if essence and blood dry up, there arises a lower syndrome of dryness and stagnation. Furthermore, all human visceral qi involves the reception by the stomach, the transformation by the spleen, and the kidneys serving as the foundation of water and fire, the origin of transformation. Now, if food and drink are obstructed and not functioning, or if stool is dry and cannot be passed, is this not a failure of transformation and a disorder of blood circulation? The authority governing the circulation of blood in the upper body lies with the spleen; in the lower body, it lies with the kidneys. Moreover, this syndrome is rarely seen in the young, but is more common in those who are middle-aged and weakened. This shows the distinction between the real and the illusory. Thus, in treating this condition, one must not abandon the fundamental roots in pursuit of quick paths, as success cannot be expected! Regarding the conditions of inspissation and reverse stomach (regurgitation), Dan Xi states that although they are named differently, the illnesses arise from the same source, which certainly shows their similarity.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>However, there is indeed a difference. In cases of reversed stomach, the food can still enter the body but then comes back out, hence called &quot;reversed stomach&quot;; in cases of blocked throat, there is an obstruction preventing food from going down, hence called &quot;blocked throat.&quot; When food enters and then comes back out, it is due to yang deficiency that cannot transform; this can be supplemented and warmed, making treatment relatively easy. When food cannot go down, it is due to qi stagnation that cannot move; treatment may either require unblocking or assisting, thus making the process more difficult. This reflects the differences in severity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those suffering from reversed stomach often can still eat, while those with blocked throat cannot eat. The illness of blocked throat is located in the chest and upper jiao, while the illness of reversed stomach is located in the middle and lower jiao. This is a distinction in the symptoms. Therefore, the treatment for reversed stomach often needs to boost the source of fire to assist in transformation, while the treatment for blocked throat often needs to nourish the heart and spleen to alleviate the stagnation of qi. Since the symptoms are different, diagnosis and treatment should also be categorized accordingly.</p>
<p>The condition of blocked throat often accompanies constipation. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;The three yang that are bound together is called the throat.&quot; Zhang Zihe states: &quot;The three yang refers to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder.&quot; The binding refers to heat binding.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>When there is a heat block in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; when there is a heat block in the large intestine, there is constipation; when there is a heat block in the bladder, the fluids are depleted. When the three yangs are blocked, there is obstruction both before and after. If the lower part is not open, it must flow upward, which causes difficulty in swallowing food; even if it goes down, it comes back up. This is due to the yang fire pushing upwards instead of descending. In my humble opinion, this interpretation is quite incorrect. The meaning of &quot;block&quot; in the context of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not primarily refer to heat, as this text states: &quot;When yin and yang are blocked, there is more yin and less yang, which is called stone water.&quot; Furthermore, it is mentioned in the discussion of pain: &quot;Thinking causes the qi to become blocked.&quot; Is it thus correct to equate blockage with heat? Moreover, heat facilitates flow, while cold causes condensation; this is a fundamental principle of yin and yang. Indeed, frost condenses into ice only in extreme cold, and heat does not do so. This is an evident truth of the natural order. The principles of yin and yang in the human body are no different; only humans cannot fully comprehend them, leading to many misunderstandings. Furthermore, when the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; refers to the blockage of the three yangs, it speaks only of the small intestine and bladder, with no relation to the large intestine. The three yangs refer to the sun, with the hand representing the small intestine and the foot representing the bladder.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The small intestine belongs to fire and the bladder to water. If fire does not transform, yang energy does not circulate and its transmission fails; if water does not transform, yin energy does not circulate, and the distinction between clarity and turbidity becomes muddled. This is the root cause of obstruction. Zihé did not discern this and ultimately attributed the obstruction of the three yang channels entirely to heat, leading future generations to universally interpret it as fire—how misguided is that! </p>
<p>However, diseases associated with obstructions do not stem from a single source; in fact, both qi and blood can become obstructed, and both yang and yin can lead to their own types of obstructions. I do not mean to say that all obstructions are cold and devoid of heat; rather, yin obstructions and yang obstructions manifest differently, and this distinction must not be overlooked. Yang obstruction is indeed a heat obstruction, arising from fire&#39;s excessive disturbance of yin, causing it to congeal. This only occurs with exterior pathogens invading the interior or with true heat in the yangming channel.</p>
<p>Moreover, heat obstructions must be accompanied by symptoms such as thirst, fever, and other signs, which are easily identifiable, clearly reflected in the pulse being forceful, large, slippery, and solid. If there is obstruction below but no signs of heat above, this indicates a yin obstruction—how can one claim it to be heat? The essence of yin obstruction lies in the lack of fire in the life gate, leading to inadequate transformation of essence and resulting in congealment below, with the flow of treatment stagnated. This is exclusively due to internal injuries to the blood and qi, affecting true yin, as is the case with the symptoms of food stagnation. The symptoms of food stagnation are widely recognized as stemming from internal injuries.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>At this point of internal injury, how can one assess the health of the internal organs and the vital energies, while still claiming it to be heat? Is it truly necessary for the original yang to be completely depleted before there can be another path to life? Alas! This is something I cannot comprehend, and I must clarify!</p>
<p>The condition of food obstruction has often been considered by ancient scholars to be due to cold. Since Liu Hejian treated food obstruction with the Three Chengqi Decoction, Zhang Zihe has discussed the complete binding of the three yangs as being due to heat, also stating that a person&#39;s overeating does not happen suddenly: it may either injure due to food or drink, or due to heat in the stomach causing a desire to vomit. If physicians do not understand the root cause and instead prescribe aromatic herbs, cassia, pepper, and cloves, how can they assert weakness and then supplement with heat?</p>
<p>For those with inherent heat, the three yangs will certainly bind, and food will easily ascend. Yet physicians still argue that the stomach is cold and cannot accept food, cauterizing with needles and moxibustion; as the three yangs become increasingly bound over time, they eventually lead to food obstruction. I find this reasoning puzzling. </p>
<p>Food obstruction arises from dryness and is not fundamentally a sign of true heat. Is the Three Chengqi Decoction still applicable? Liu Hejian&#39;s view appears inaccurate. Moreover, an excess of meat and wine does not necessarily lead to food obstruction; is it the case that all who suffer from food obstruction are people with inherent heat? Zhang Zihe&#39;s perspective also seems to have its flaws.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>From then on, Danxi followed the teachings of the two Sons and critically evaluated the errors in &quot;Jufang.&quot; He stated that the initial sickness of qi may arise from various sources: either from careless eating and drinking, or exposure to wind and rain, or internal emotional disturbances, or from overly rich food that excessively nourishes yang qi, leading to the accumulation of heat in the diaphragm. It may also come from a full constitution without sweating, or a naturally irritable temper causing liver fire to rise, resulting in stagnation of bodily fluids, which makes qi unwell. This could manifest as distension, pain, foul belching, sour regurgitation, or a sense of fullness. Without seeking the root cause, one hastily identifies it as cold and hastily administers spicy, aromatic, and drying heat remedies, experiencing temporary relief that mistakenly seems like a miraculous cure. Continuing rich flavors and failing to regulate emotions lead to a recurrence, with old issues being aggravated, momentarily relieving stagnant fluids but making them easier to accumulate again. In half a month or a month, previous ailments re-emerge. Physicians, not understanding the situation, insist it is due to cold, and revert to previous remedies for quick results, hoping for lasting effects through prolonged use to warm the spleen, strengthen the stomach, and promote the movement of stagnation, with the hope that one day there will be a clear resolution. However, they forget that the stomach is the sea of grains and can only receive when it is clear and harmonious, and the spleen is the organ of digestion that can only function properly when it is also clear and harmonious. Now, instead of gaining assistance from the offset of fragrant warming, they allow their condition to worsen, causing long-term complications. This is indeed lamentable. This is Danxi&#39;s teaching, which, when seen by later generations, is universally regarded as the utmost principle. Even in my early years, I could not help but admire it, yet now I increasingly see its errors.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>What is it? If we examine the causes of the illness described, some may indeed be true while others may not, but it is difficult to clearly differentiate them. If we rely solely on this evidence and insist on classifying it as heat, can we be free from error? Moreover, since it is stated that dry heat medicines can promptly bring relief, it surely possesses some efficacy. If dry heat can be effective, can it truly be said that only genuine heat can be effective? The spleen is antagonistic to dampness, hence dryness can be effective. Fire can nurture earth, thus heat can be effective as well. Warming dryness supports yang; this is the proper treatment of the spleen family, and to insist otherwise, leading to doubts among later generations, seems excessive. If it is said that indulging in rich flavors and emotions without moderation leads to recurrence, whose fault is this? Can it also be attributed to a mistake in medicine? Furthermore, concerning the claim that a balanced spleen and stomach can receive and transform, this is indeed a sound principle, who would dispute it? However, my understanding of balance differs from that of Danxi. But why is that? Danxi expresses concern about excessive fire; I express concern about diminishing yang. With such differences, who will believe? Please consider the principles governing heaven and humanity; how about that? What both heaven and humanity rely upon is solely this yang qi. Thus, the text states: Clear and tranquil weather is illuminating. It also says: Yang qi is like heaven and sun; if it loses its position, it withers and does not manifest, thus heavenly operations should shine with sunlight.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>From this, it can be said that the universe thrives in harmony, with the sun playing a significant role. When the yang energy prevails, it brings warmth and light, allowing all things to flourish; is this not harmony? When the yin energy prevails, it causes wind and haze, resulting in stagnation; is this not a departure from harmony? Moreover, the flourishing of all things in spring and summer arises from the vigor of yang; while the decline of all things in autumn and winter is a sign of waning yang. What sustains human life is nothing but this. </p>
<p>Thus, when food enters in the morning, it is digested by noon; when it enters the stomach by noon, it is digested by evening. The heat within, similar to that of a boiling cauldron, must align with harmony. This is the normal state of a person and is precisely what we call the stomach&#39;s energy. If one eats in the morning and is not hungry by noon, eats at noon and is not hungry by evening, and if digestion is slow, this is an indication of diminished yang energy. </p>
<p>Moreover, if one finds oneself completely unable to function or digest, doctors would still assert there is fire; must this source of transformation be entirely extinguished before one can be well again? It is truly lamentable! The principles of the world are not numerous, yet why do we find so much divergence of opinion? I often wish to speak, but I am always aware of my own biases. Yet at the most perplexing points, I cannot but present the ugly truths. How can I maintain my own correctness without causing further conflict? </p>
<p>I have often heard the sage Mr. Kangjie say: to be a dragon-slayer in the world, one must not shy away from reading texts that are not sacred. This is deeply resonant. Is this not true? Is this not true?<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>In the treatment of phlegm obstruction, the spleen and kidneys should be the main focus. The spleen governs transformation and transportation, and its extensive networks spread throughout the chest region; the kidneys govern fluids, with their energy regulating the lower yin. Therefore, the obstruction in the upper jiao is attributed to the spleen, while the blockage in the lower jiao is attributed to the kidneys. To treat the spleen, one should proceed from warming nourishment, while to treat the kidneys, one should focus on moistening. Beyond these two methods, there are no shortcuts. However, the principle of balance indicates that the heavens and earth are interconnected, and thus, the three yang must emerge from the ground before all things thrive, illustrating that the mother of spleen earth rises from below.</p>
<p>Chancellor Chu said: &quot;To treat external diseases, address internal issues; to treat upper ailments, support the lower.&quot; One must discern the deficiency or excess of the organs and understand the dynamic between parent and child organs in disease. This wisdom is valuable and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>For treating phlegm obstruction, when both qi and blood are deficient, one should use the Five Blessings Decoction or the Ten Complete Great Nourishing Soup. If there is spleen deficiency in the upper body, one should use the Four Gentlemen Decoction; if there is spleen deficiency with cold, the Five Gentlemen Decoction is indicated. If there is deficiency in the spleen and lung with dry blood, one should use ginger juice decoction; for lower yin deficiency, one should use the Left Return Decoction or the Great Nourishing Decoction. If there is yin deficiency with yang deficiency, one should use the Right Return Decoction with angelica, or formulas like the Right Return Pill or the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill. These are all foundational treatment methods.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>When experiencing initial symptoms of obstruction, where there is slight weakness, it is advisable to prepare a warm stomach drink with added angelica and magnolia bark. If there is phlegm and qi not cleared, with stagnation in the upper diaphgram, a combination of Er Chen Tang (Two Evolved Decoction) with added magnolia bark is recommended, or Liu&#39;an decoction may also be suitable. If there are signs of qi not flowing smoothly, or if there is slight pain in the chest and abdomen, adding or subtracting from Er Chen Tang to alleviate those symptoms is appropriate. </p>
<p>For those who initially feel that food is not digesting well, and who are not severely aged, a prompt use of Da Jian Pi Wan (Great Spleen Strengthening Pill), or pills made with musk, ginseng, ginger, and zhigao (bitter orange), to regulate spleen qi is the best strategy; Shaoyao Zhi Zhu Wan (Pill with Peony and Bitter Orange) may also work. </p>
<p>If there is both obstruction and constipation due to lack of fire and stagnation, merely observe for dryness of blood and deficiency of yin. In this case, Wufu Drink or Daying Decoction, with a few coins of alcohol to wash meat cistanche, should be decocted and consumed. Alternatively, using pig gall to gradually moisten from below while treating the upper part with spleen-regulating remedies is the best approach. </p>
<p>One may also consume more cow or sheep milk products to nourish the essence and gradually moisturize, avoiding any impatience! If both qi and blood are not greatly depleted but there is significant stagnation in the lower abdomen, it may become necessary to temporarily alleviate it. For mild cases, Yuzhu San, Ren Shen Li Ge Wan, or Soufeng Shunqi Wan may be suitable; for severe cases, Da Huang Gan Cao Tang should be used appropriately.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>Using warming and tonifying methods to treat obstruction of the throat, one might suspect stagnation and find it too slow, not realizing the collapse of central qi. This is most concerning: if the root cause isn&#39;t swiftly remedied, how can the spleen&#39;s qi be restored? If warming and tonifying methods cause greater obstruction, one must reluctantly adjust the treatment. Yet, it is crucial to carefully select from the foundational qi to ensure safety. </p>
<p>Even if after using tonics no immediate effect is seen, as long as there is no blockage, it indicates a fitting combination of medicine and ailment. This condition is particularly difficult to treat. If the patient can tolerate tonics, they must take them in substantial amounts to gradually see results and achieve full recovery. One shouldn&#39;t be impatient and suspicious, causing self-doubt and fluctuation in treatment effectiveness.</p>
<p>If urgent remedies are sought for immediate relief, employing drastic measures such as Da Huang (rhubarb), Mang Xiao (bitter salt), San Leng (sparganii rhizome), E Zhu (curcuma), Yu Jin (curcuma), Tao Ren (peach kernel), or rolling phlegm pills will not yield results; they will only damage gastric qi, leading to inevitable deterioration. This is hastening towards demise and must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>In treating throat obstruction, traditional practices rely on ginseng and astragalus to tonify the original qi, while using rice and millet to detoxify and strengthen the stomach, bamboo juice to clear phlegm and disperse masses, dried ginger to warm the center, fresh ginger to eliminate impurities, cow and sheep milk to nourish blood and moisten fluids, as well as honey and angelica to relieve dryness. These are the primary treatments, with adjustments based on the symptoms as necessary, all of which are sound methods.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>For those who are obese, instances of choking are rare; when they do occur, it is advisable to use Erchen Decoction with ginseng and white atractylodes. For individuals who are blood-deficient and weak, use Siwu Decoction combined with Erchen Decoction, adding peach kernels, safflower, leek juice, child&#39;s urine, and cow or sheep milk. If choking is caused by emotional distress, combine Erchen Decoction with xiangfu, angelica, mu xiang, betel nut, and sand ginger. For those who drink alcohol and suffer from choking, add huanglian, sand ginger, and sugar to Erchen Decoction. If there is heat in the chest, add huanglian, huangqin, jie geng, and sand ginger. If the spleen is insufficiently nourished, add shenqu, sand ginger, and malt to assist digestion. For severe dry constipation accompanying choking, use da huang, or apply Erchen Decoction with wine to steam da huang and peach kernels for lubrication, as this is an emergency measure. Alternatively, use Siwu Decoction with peach kernels, child&#39;s urine, leek juice, and drink plenty of cow or sheep milk as the best strategy. </p>
<p>According to ancient methods for treating choking, these principles have been largely covered here. Although there are appropriate and inappropriate treatments among them, all are documented for selection. Generally, older individuals suffering from this condition are often difficult to treat due to deficient blood and qi. If the stool resembles sheep dung, it is untreatable, as the large intestine has no blood. If the phlegm is like crab foam, it is also untreatable, reflecting depletion of spleen qi. Abdominal pain that feels like being cut by knives indicates an extreme deficiency of nutrients, and it is untreatable as blood is exhausted within.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The Argument of Reflux</p>
<p>The phenomenon of reflux is fundamentally due to a deficiency of fire. When food enters the stomach, it warms the spleen and strengthens it, leading to complete digestion; how could it then be rejected? Various schools of thought suggest it is due to phlegm or excess heat. They do not realize that the retention of phlegm and fluid stems from a weakness in the stomach, causing undigested food to be expelled — how could it be considered properly digested? Wang Taibu said, &quot;If there is obstruction in the stomach causing nausea and food cannot be taken in, this indicates the presence of fire; but if food comes back up after being ingested, this indicates a lack of fire.&quot; This statement is indeed comprehensive. However, even without fire, it is essential to discern between the upper, middle, and lower jiaos, as different conditions apply. </p>
<p>If cold is present in the upper jiao, it often results in nausea or a general feeling of wanting to vomit; this indicates a deficiency of yang in the stomach. If cold is in the middle jiao, then the food does not digest, and may be expelled shortly after, indicating a deficiency of yang within the stomach. If cold is in the lower jiao, it can lead to morning vomiting of food eaten the previous evening, or evening vomiting of food eaten in the morning; this occurs because food enters the pylorus but cannot be transformed by the fire, resulting in expulsion due to prolonged retention, indicative of a deficiency of yang at the life gate (ming men). Thus, for any treatment of this condition, if one does not understand where the root of the problem lies, they may blindly guess and aim for results without understanding the underlying pathology, making it exceedingly difficult.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>To treat the condition of reverse stomach (nausea), it is essential to distinguish between its recent and long-standing causes. It may stem from excessive drinking leading to dampness from alcohol, or from overeating cold foods that deplete the true yang. It could also be due to emotional distress that exhausts the internal energy. In summary, this is primarily a case of internal injury, which weakens the stomach energy. Therefore, any treatment for this should focus on supporting the righteous energy, strengthening the spleen, and nourishing the stomach. </p>
<p>For new cases where the stomach energy has not yet deteriorated significantly, if the food has not been digested, one should also remove the stagnation. If there is still rebellious qi, it is essential to also resolve the stagnation. In cases that have persisted for a longer time, or for those with inherent weak energy, one should specifically apply warming and reinforcing treatments. It is crucial to avoid mixing treatments improperly, recklessly using harsh and drastic remedies such as those for digesting food and resolving phlegm, which could severely injure the stomach energy and lead to further complications.</p>
<p>For conditions characterized by deficiency in the upper jiao with mild cold and nausea, ginger soup is the best choice, and tangerine peel soup may also be suitable.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>If qi deficiency is invaded by cold, leading to nausea and vomiting of food, it is advisable to use Huangya Wan or Jiangpi Ganjiang Tang. If cold phlegm is predominant, Xiao Banxia Tang or Da Banxia Tang should be employed. </p>
<p>If the deficiency is in the middle jiao and food is returned after a long time, take Wujunzhi Jian, Lizhong Tang, Wenge Yinian or Shengzhu Jian. If the stomach is severely deficient, use Siwei Huoyang Yin or Huangya Wan. If combined with cold phlegm, opt for Liu Junzi Tang or Lizhong Huatan Wan. If there is phlegm due to fluid retention, Jinshui Liu Jun Jian should be used. </p>
<p>If the stomach is not severely cold but slightly deficient with stagnation, Wuwai Yigong San is recommended. </p>
<p>If the deficiency is in the lower jiao, and there is vomiting of breakfast by evening, or food taken in a long time is regurgitated, the problem lies in yin. Unless one nourishes the life gate to support the spleen, there will be no fire for transformation and no earth for generation, akin to a pot without fuel, incapable of cooking grains and ultimately yielding no benefit.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>One should use the Six Flavor Rehmannia Decoction, or combine ginseng and aconite for a yin-regulating brew, or utilize the Right Returning Decoction and similar remedies to address the issue. This is a frequently employed effective method that must not be overlooked! </p>
<p>When the symptoms of counterflow have just begun, and the qi is strong, one may first proceed with purification. Decocting formulas like Erchen Decoction or Chenpi Banxia Decoction can clear phlegm and regulate qi, while Pingwei Powder, Bujing Zhenqi Powder, and Wuling Powder can eliminate dampness and alleviate stagnation. Additionally, Banxia Gancao Decoction, Zhongjing Wuzhuyu Decoction, and Chenpi Decoction can dispel cold. However, these remedies should only be employed when truly obstructive pathogens are present. If the condition has persisted for some time and the gastric qi is weak, these remedies are not advisable.</p>
<p>It is common for counterflow symptoms to coincide with constipation, as the upward flow is hindered by obstruction below.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>If the lower passages are obstructed, how can it not be a reflection of the upper energy not transforming? It is because the spleen and stomach have weakened qi; thus, the cycle of circulation does not function, and there is insufficient blood production, leading to a stagnation below which causes blockage. This is a true manifestation of desiccation of the yin. It is essential to gradually nourish the blood and qi and moisten the internal organs, as this is the fundamental treatment. If one merely seeks immediate results without addressing the root cause, there may be temporary relief, but the true yin will become further depleted. Therefore, in treating this condition, if one observes deficiency of yin along with cold, the main approach should be to tonify the yang, significantly incorporating ingredients like angelica, cistanche, leek juice, and ginger juice. If there is deficiency of yin accompanied by heat, the main approach should be to nourish the yin, adding substances like milk, children&#39;s urine, ghee, honey, pig fat, and various types of blood. However, these treatments are particularly difficult to yield results, and one must not desire quick fixes. Without a period of careful adjustment, usually spanning several weeks or months, recovery cannot be achieved! Conditions presenting with feces resembling sheep droppings, or those who are older and suffer from this ailment, are especially challenging to treat. For instances of reversed stomach due to alcohol dampening the spleen, the main prescription should be Ge Hua Jie Cheng Decoction. If there is excess dampness leading to heat, with symptoms of stomach fire surging upwards, Huang Qin Decoction or Ban Xia Xie Xin Decoction should be administered.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method for Reflux and Nausea</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of reflux symptoms, it is not necessarily a stomach issue. At this point, taking Xiao Yao San with ten grams of Huai Lian can stop it. However, many doctors do not understand the treatment method and instead use ingredients like Xiang Sha, Hou Po, Zhi Ke, and Sha Ren, which do not work; they then switch to using Da Huang and Ba Dou, which also fail. Next, they try cooling herbs like Huang Lian, Huang Bo, Huang Qin, Zhi Zi, and Zhi Mu, but this too is ineffective. They try warming herbs such as Gui Zhi, Bai Guo, Rou Gui, Fu Zi, Gan Jiang, and Wu Zhu Yu, yet there is still no response. Finally, they use dispersing herbs like Chai Hu, Jing Jie, Jie Geng, Fang Feng, and Su Zi, resulting in the condition of reflux.</p>
<p>Now, I pass on a formula: one ounce of Shu Di, four coins of Shan Zhu Yu, three coins of Mai Dong, one coin each of Bei Wu Wei, Yuan Shen, Dang Gui, and Bai Jie Zi, and two coins of Niu Xi, boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in not treating the reflux directly, which is precisely how to treat it. The reason for reflux is the depletion of Yin water in the kidneys. When kidney water is insufficient, the large and small intestines cannot be sufficiently moistened, leading to dryness. With dry intestines, food entering the stomach cannot descend and must instead be vomited back up. Therefore, the method of treatment should not focus on the upper part but rather on the lower.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>The formula employs prepared rehmannia and shan zhu yu, which are purely for replenishing the water in the kidneys. When kidney water is sufficient, the large intestine is also nourished with water, allowing it to expand and properly accommodate substances. When the pathway for water is wide, boats of all sizes can navigate freely; hence, there is no fear that a small boat cannot transport grain. This treatment is appropriate for a deficiency of water in the kidneys that fails to moisten the large intestine. However, if the kidneys are cold and deficient, this method is not suitable. Although the name &quot;reversal of stomach&quot; may be the same, the actual condition differs. Reversal due to a lack of water in the kidneys causes immediate vomiting upon swallowing food, while reversal from a lack of fire in the kidneys results in delayed vomiting, where food is retained until the next day before being expelled. For example, food eaten today may only be vomited out the next day. </p>
<p>The formula includes one tael of prepared rehmannia, four qian of shan zhu yu, three qian of mai dong, two qian each of shan yao and fu ling, one qian each of northern wuweizi, dan pi, ze xie, niu xi, fu zi, and rou gui, and is decocted in water for consumption. This is the eight-ingredient pill soup. The key lies in using fu zi and rou gui to nourish kidney water while also addressing the fire within the water. Nourishing the fire helps to rejuvenate the life-gate fire. The qi of the spleen and stomach must rely on the life-gate fire to be generated; like a pot without fire, how can it cook? Without it, the water is cold and metal is chilled, leading to frost. One must first restore the initial warmth of yang to resolve this.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>The human body’s spleen and stomach function similarly; however, in the case of illnesses caused by cold and chill, one usually experiences abdominal pain and distress. Yet, if there are no such symptoms now, what could be the reason for the upward sensation accompanied by vomiting? It is because when the spleen and stomach have a passage, the cold pathogenic energy does not remain within. Now, with the upward forces releasing through the mouth and throat, the gastric entrance has become a broad avenue, allowing for free passage without obstruction. Thus, the energy easily flows, and there is no need for it to accumulate within the central region, lurking in the heart and abdomen, causing cold to generate heat that brings suffering to the spleen and stomach. This, in fact, is what allows for the absence of pain in the heart and abdomen. This is not merely about treating the symptoms of vomiting but rather addressing the root cause of it; this marks the beginning of transformative methods for treating diseases.</p>
<p>When food enters and quickly exits, it is due to the deficiency of kidney water, which fails to moisten the throat, leading to dryness and an immediate expulsion. When food lingers and then is expelled, it is due to the deficiency of kidney fire, which cannot warm the spleen, resulting in cold in the spleen and subsequent expulsion. To treat the symptoms of vomiting, it is essential to address the kidneys and to differentiate whether there is fire or no fire; doing so can transform potentially fatal symptoms into life-sustaining outcomes. The ideal remedy for the symptoms of vomiting is to use Zhang Jing’s Rehmannia Decoction. If there is no fire, one should add Aconite and Cinnamon, which will yield beneficial results just as before. However, some people may use Zhang Jing’s prescriptions without achieving results. Why is this? It is due to improperly applying the method, rather than any deficiency in the formulas themselves. Now, regarding the two prescriptions: one for treating vomiting without fire includes one ounce of cooked Rehmannia, one ounce of Sichuan Cornelian cherry, and three qian each of Aconite, Poria, Water Plantain, Moutan Peony, and Cinnamon, along with one qian of Chinese Yam, to be decocted and consumed.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>For treating fire and regurgitation, use: 2 taels of cooked rehmannia, 1 tael of yam, 3 qian each of alisma and processed moutan root, 5 qian each of poria, ophiopogon, and cornelian cherry, and 2 qian of northen schisandra, decoct in water and take. Adjustments can be made to this formula naturally, effectively treating regurgitation.</p>
<p>The symptoms of regurgitation, though not immediately fatal, if treated improperly, can lead to death. Regurgitation is often due to kidney deficiency without fire. Therefore, if food is eaten today, it may be vomited by tomorrow, as stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that food consumes the person then exits. Food entering the stomach and then being vomited seems like a stomach problem. However, the kidneys serve as the gatekeeper for the stomach; if the kidneys are ill, the stomach will also become ill. For food to enter the stomach, it must be aided by kidney fluids, and the throat must have pathways for moisture to enable proper digestion. </p>
<p>Without fire in the kidneys, there is no fuel for the pot, so how can it steam the water and grain? This leads to cold in the kidneys and spleen; a cold spleen cannot transform food, causing it to rise to the stomach, which cannot accept it, resulting in vomiting. The formula for settling the stomach includes: 3 taels of cooked rehmannia, 2 taels of cornelian cherry, 3 qian each of cinnamon and poria, decoct in water and take. One dose can stop vomiting, and ten can completely cure the illness. This treatment is for those who vomit from morning to night, and for those who vomit right after meals, do not use cinnamon. Instead, add 1 tael of ophiopogon and 1 qian of northen schisandra; this adjustment has proven effective. Both formulas are great for nourishing the water and fire in the kidneys without directly treating the stomach, proving to be more effective than treating the stomach itself.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>

<p>The Secret Essentials of Preservation of Life states: There are several types of stagnant qi in the diaphragm: some arise from deficiency of qi causing anger and obstruction, some from blood deficiency leading to injury from overwork, some from food stagnation, some from spleen deficiency damaging the original qi, some from phlegm and fire accumulation, some from emotional disturbances and desires, from overindulgence in drinking and sexual activity, resulting in the spleen and stomach being constrained, and the failure of yin and yang to interact, which leads to diaphragm disorders. </p>
<p>In practicing breath regulation, it is advisable to do so on an empty stomach. With both hands suspended, let the body fall down slightly while taking in a few breaths to allow the qi to fill the diaphragm. Both feet should step in a sequence of two and nine degrees, to relieve stagnant qi from the diaphragm. The weakness of the stomach can be remedied without medication.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Technique</strong>: When beginning this condition, start by adjusting your breathing while seated, following a cyclical counting of the cosmos. Visualize a pound of divine water descending into the dantian, subsequently guarding the back region, circulating through the chest, either focusing or dispersing. This practice may be performed in sitting or lying positions, with both movement and stillness, completing the practice in a hundred days.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Method</strong>: Push from the chest down to the navel, then allow the rising source water to cleanse it. Visualize the water from the kidney flowing along the back, washing out from the heart, and push down through the large intestine&#39;s nine bends.</p>
<p>For an upper diaphragmatic heat and lower diaphragmatic cold, with a dry mouth, the breath regulation method is to push from the heart down to the navel, then visualize kidney water rising to the back, flowing out to cleanse it gently, or breathe without forcing it. Alternatively, when visualizing the back, rest the tongue against the upper palate to allow salivation naturally.</p>
<p>For an upper diaphragmatic cold and lower diaphragmatic heat, the breath regulation method is to push from the heart down to the navel, then focus momentarily below the navel imagining a stream of water descending to the bladder, upwards to the tailbone, right up to the crown, allowing drops to flow back from the heart to the navel, rotating and cleansing.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Study</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Records of the Historian,&quot; it is stated in the biography of Minister Cang: The prince of Qi had a young child who was ill. He summoned his ministers for diagnosis, checked the child&#39;s pulse, and said: &quot;The child is suffering from Qi distress.&quot; The illness caused him to be anxious and unable to eat, with intermittent vomiting. When he was slightly relieved of worry, he would eat and drink a little. I immediately prepared a medicine to help relieve the Qi, and on the first day, the Qi was reduced; on the second day, he was able to eat; by the third day, he was completely cured. This demonstrates that to understand a child&#39;s illness, one must diagnose their pulse to assess their heart Qi. If it is turbid and erratic, it is diagnosed as Yang obstruction. The pulse technique states: If the pulse is rapid and the sickness is difficult to resolve and inconsistent, then the primary issue lies within the heart. A strong, heated pulse throughout the body indicates a serious Yang condition, which is linked to the heart&#39;s predominance. Thus, anxiety leads to an inability to eat, resulting in obstruction of the collateral channels. If collateral channels are obstructed, blood can rise upward. When blood rises, it leads to death. This is born from a sorrowful heart, and the illness arises from worry.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>The text states: </p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Serving Parents,&quot; it mentions that a woman, the wife of Li Guan, suffered from a choking sensation in her throat as if something were lodged there, leading to food not going down and a feeling of fullness. Other medical treatments were ineffective. A doctor named Dai examined her pulse and identified it as phlegm blocking the throat. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; notes that the three yang combine to form a blockage. Wang Qiyuan further explained that an excess of yang leads to rejection when eating, preventing food from entering. First, they administered a medicinal powder to clear the channels, half of which successfully passed through, and then they used a pill to ensure the rest was expelled. After three times, food went down smoothly. They continued with a medicinal powder made from melon seeds, and she could eat heartily as she had in the past.</p>
<p>In &quot;Ben Shi Fang,&quot; it is stated that in &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; there was a case where a young woman suffered from similar symptoms, prompted to vomit immediately after consuming cakes or broths. During the Zhenguan period, it was noted that Xu Fengyu&#39;s brothers and others were acclaimed as skilled doctors, but despite imperial orders for treatment, the doctors exhausted their methods and were unable to cure her. She gradually grew weaker and eventually died. Suddenly, a guard suggested that taking donkey urine was very effective. She took two portions in the morning and later vomited only half of her food; after eating again in the afternoon, she took another two portions, and the vomiting subsided. Later reports indicated that five or six people in the palace suffered from similar symptoms, all taking the remedy at once with success. The medicine was somewhat toxic and should not be taken in excess. It was recommended to take two portions of hot urine, and for severely ill patients, to take it daily for good results.</p>
<p>Danxi noted that a middle-aged woman suffered from vomiting and was treated with a decoction of four herbs, adding harmonized white tangerine peel, a few peach kernels, sweet licorice, and strong red flowers boiled together, mixed with donkey urine to prevent any potential for worm infestations. After several dozen doses, she was stabilized.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>A carpenter from Taizhou, aged twenty-seven, was diligent in his work and skilled in his craft. He had a wife who enjoyed drinking and had been suffering from a stomach ailment for half a year, showing a pale complexion, a thin and irregular pulse, and difficulty with urination which occurred only once every eight or nine days. His stools were dry and hard, resembling sheep droppings, and he was greatly weakened and fatigued. I diagnosed this as depleting vital energy and blood. I first administered a decoction of six gentlemen’s soup with added sugarcane juice, plus aconite and rhubarb. I waited until his stools were slightly more moist and instructed him to stop working and rest at home, consuming warm fresh cow&#39;s milk in small sips, finishing a cup each time, five to six times a day, gradually increasing to seven or eight times. He was advised not to eat any other food, including vegetables, fruits, porridge, or rice. After half a month, his stools became moist, and after a month, he was stable. However, he sometimes experienced dry mouth, likely due to the lingering effects of alcohol, so I suggested he drink a little sugarcane juice. After nearly two months, he was stable.</p>
<p>A man from Hangzhou, over forty years old, had suffered from nausea for two months. He felt dry in the mouth and had little appetite, sometimes not vomiting at all; when he did vomit, the food appeared coated in saliva and only relieved his chest discomfort afterwards. His pulse was thin, and when forceful, it was large and taut, likely due to his earlier use of harsh medicinal drugs in his youth. At this time, it was early autumn and still hot, so I recommended that he frequently prepare bamboo sap, cooking poppy seeds into porridge to replace his usual meals. He was instructed to take only one or two sips at a time and to drink warm fluids regularly. From then on, he did not vomit. As the days grew cooler, I suggested making thin porridge with running water, adding a little bamboo sap, and after a while, incorporating four substances (herbs) soup with aged tangerine peel to nourish his blood. After more than a month, he was stable.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Medicine&quot; states: Yang Shi suffered from wind attacking his heart, experienced vomiting and regurgitation of food, and was emaciated all over.

<p>The &quot;Extensive Records of the Five Elements&quot; mentions: During the Yonghui era, there was a monk named Weize who suffered from choking and could not eat. He told his disciples, &quot;After I die, you can open my chest and throat to see what is inside; this was how I died.&quot; The disciples indeed opened his chest and found something resembling a fish with two heads, covered in fleshy scales. They placed it in a bowl, and it kept jumping without stopping. They tried various flavors, but it disappeared with all of them. </p>
<p>It was summer, and thick blue paste was made. At that time, a monk placed the paste in a container, and this creature began to move around the vessel, soon transforming into water. This was a parasitic creature, not the &quot;five choke&quot; conditions; later generations mistakenly used blue paste to treat choking.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>The &quot;Essential Readings of the Medical Tradition&quot; states: The wife of the county magistrate Zhang Mengduan suffered from anger and worry, leading to frequent choking on food and a lingering pain in her chest. Upon examining her, I noted that her pulse was tight and slippery, indicating phlegm in the upper abdomen. I prescribed Er Chen Decoction with ginger juice and bamboo juice. Zhang&#39;s uncle Yuan asked if Banxia was too drying. I replied, &quot;The damp phlegm fills the middle; without this treatment, it cannot be resolved.&quot; After four doses, the illness showed no improvement, so I switched to Da Banxia Decoction, which she took for four doses, at which point the chest pain ceased. After another four doses, the choking sensation also lessened, and after taking twenty doses in total, she felt well. If Banxia were used improperly and replaced with other medicines, could healing be expected? Only those with little phlegm and not overweight should avoid this treatment.</p>
<p>In Jiangyou, the scholar Fang Chunhe, nearing fifty, became overly emotional and angry, suffering from choking for three months. He consumed a cup of powdered drink daily and half a cup of fermented fluid, vomiting some. His six pulses were thin and soft, indicative of a condition of deficient cold. I prescribed the Lizhong Decoction with added human milk, ginger juice, white honey, and Banxia. His condition improved after one dose; after ten doses, he could consume gruel daily. I then added the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with bamboo juice and ginger juice for forty doses, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>In Nandu, Xu Fengcheng complained of an obstruction in his throat, unable to swallow solid substances, relying solely on human milk and several cups of alcohol, producing ongoing frothy saliva. When he sought treatment from me, I remarked, &quot;The presence of white froth means it is not treatable.&quot; Although his pulse was not yet weakened, I hoped for the best. I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, peach kernel, cow&#39;s milk, white honey, and ginger juice for a total of ten doses, which gradually reduced the froth. By doubling the doses of ginseng and atractylodes, he was completely well after three months.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>In the twenty-fifth year of Jiading, Qian Yuan suffered from deep sorrow due to the death of a relative, leading to excessive grief that rendered him unable to eat.

He sought a diagnosis from me, and I examined his pulse, which was strong, indicating this was not a terminal condition. I prescribed a concoction of wine-steamed rhubarb, combined with peach kernel, angelica, cardamom, and dried tangerine peel, formed into honey pills for him to take. After five doses, he had a significant bowel movement with much dry stool and blood, and his illness seemed to dissipate. Within a few days, he was able to eat double the usual amount.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Canon&quot; states: A man, fifty-three years old, developed a choking sensation during the summer and autumn, suffering from stomach pain, unable to eat; or after eating, food would regurgitate long after, experiencing dry, hard stools, and exhibiting significant blackening and emaciation. He sought treatment from me, and upon examining his pulse, I found the right wrist pulse vigorous and strong before the joint, slightly deep and small after the joint, while the left wrist showed a sinking and wiry pulse in all three positions, and a weak pulse at the extremity. I concluded that this was a case of insufficient vital energy, with Wood overpowering Earth, damp heat in the upper burner causing phlegm accumulation, and blood deficiency in the lower burner leading to dry, hardened stools. The upward surge of Yin fire was blocking the entrance and thus preventing food intake. I used a formula of Four Substances to generate blood, Four Gentlemen to tonify Qi, and Two Chen to eliminate phlegm, combining them with ginger-fried rhubarb, stir-fried bitter orange, and a few grains of cardamom, alongside occasional bowel-softening pills or Danxi&#39;s phlegm-reducing pills. After six months of taking over a hundred applications of the initial formula, his condition was completely stabilized.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>In &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; it is said: Li Sixuan&#39;s wife was pregnant, and during the winter months, she felt cold. As spring arrived, she initially did not notice it. She continued to eat chicken noodles and eggs, which led to food-related cold damage, and her condition took a month to improve. However, she continued to suffer from digestive issues, experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in a cycle of sickness for a total of seventy days, with five relapses. Eventually, she developed a symptom of &quot;stomach obstruction,&quot; unable to retain any food or drink. Upon examination, her pulse surged chaotically, and pressure revealed no strength; she was constantly vomiting, her sounds as faint as insect chirps, only occasionally producing a loud retch. I said: the patient has no food or water in her stomach, completely emptied and turned outward; this is a condition that cannot be saved. Sixuan must seek effective treatment to avoid my regret. After deliberating for a long time, I advised: if absolutely necessary, a significant amount of ginseng must be used. However, as soon as it enters her stomach, it would pass straight through her intestines, likening it to spending a large fortune yet not achieving any benefit; what can be done? She replied: It is still within ten taels, and can be managed. I said: That is sufficient! Thus, I prepared a ginseng decoction mixed with powdered red stone fat to settle and stabilize her overturned stomach. Gradually, the patient&#39;s energy began to recover, and after a while, her bowel gas was released.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>After three days, having taken five taels of ginseng and one jin of red stone resin powder, both were expelled through the bowels. Even though there was food, there was still vomiting, but not of the medicine. I thought that perhaps if I mixed the dregs of the medicine with a type of porridge, there might be a hope for it to stay in the stomach a little longer, and then it could pass through the intestines more slowly. So, I took ginseng and aged tangerine peel, cutting them into pieces the size of mustard seeds, and boiled them with millet into porridge, consuming half a bowl at a time without vomiting. After a while, I had another half bowl. This was repeated for three days before my stomach felt slightly more settled. However, my intestines were still empty, so I formed pills of red stone resin, swallowing two with ginseng soup each time. After three more days, my stools were still loose. During these three days of the ginseng-tangerine porridge, I added aged grains and consumed a bowl over ten times a day, leading to great relief. I continued to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction in pill form, ultimately using nine taels of ginseng, and I fully recovered. This was also because the fetus had not yet been expelled, retaining a thread of life to continue, which allowed for this method to sustain its existence. Otherwise, even with much ginseng, how could it possibly restore vitality in the realm of nothingness? Later, a son was born, smaller in size, due to the mother suffering from an illness for a hundred days, losing her nourishment.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>Huang Zhi was suffering from a disease affecting his diaphragm for over twenty days, not having taken any food or drink. When I examined him, his pulse was absent and weak. I asked about his bowel movements; since the onset of his illness, he had not had a single one, only a constant stream of phlegm rising, causing discomfort without resolution. There was a man named Shi in the town, skilled in discerning life and death, who said that his pulse had departed from its root and would soon fail. I disagreed, saying that the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; clearly states that if there is a pulse in the upper body but none in the lower, the person should vomit; if they do not, they will die, but if they do vomit, they may not necessarily die. As long as the proper qi descends, the pathways in the body will naturally open. Therefore, this condition must be treated cautiously, as the elevated qi does not return and the inner pathways are closed, leading to a critical state. I planned to treat him slowly according to my methods, anticipating gradual improvement.</p>
<p>Thus, I took full responsibility for the treatment, to observe the results. I changed the formula to one incorporating Xuanfu and Daizhe instead of strictly adhering to the formulaic approach. Given that the patient had no pulse at the wrist, I could not assess whether he was pregnant. If he was and I mistakenly treated him with Daizheshi or Ganjiang, it could seriously harm him and cut off his breath. So, I decided to replace Daizheshi with Chishizhi and Ganjiang with softened ginger. I administered a decoction of Liu Junzi Tang with Xuanfu flowers, which eased the vomiting somewhat. His father-in-law saw that I was using ginseng and believed it would exacerbate the illness and lead to regret.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>I said: &quot;Do not fear! If this illness is not cured, I will take thirty pieces of silver as a penalty. If it is cured, I will take not a single coin.&quot; Thus, I focused my spirit on treatment, personally adjusting the medicine, and began the administration. After three days, the vomiting gradually ceased. After another three days, the porridge and drinks were gradually increased, and the whole family was very pleased. However, the patient had not had a bowel movement for over a month. On one hand, there was concern about the unresolved illness, and on the other hand, worry about the food not being digested, urging for measures to promote bowel movements at every moment. I said: &quot;The stagnation of internal energy has persisted for a long time. When food and drink enter the stomach, they can only pass through one or two sections of the intestines each day. If the food and drink accumulate for a long time, the internal energy will naturally become unobstructed. The original plan was for a gradual treatment; how can we rush this?&quot; The whole family unanimously found me unsympathetic, each time I took the pulse, I could hear the patient&#39;s breath becoming more pronounced, though they had not yet begun to curse. I feared that the herbs for moistening the intestines would cause nausea, and the herbs for clearing the intestines might harm the pregnancy and result in death. I hesitated to comply with their requests and insisted on waiting three to five days; eventually, the internal energy moved down into the intestines and the illness was fully cured. After the patient recovered, the family secretly discussed: &quot;If even one bowel movement could not occur, how could the physician be of any value?&quot; After over a month, the pregnancy gradually became noticeable, and they discussed: &quot;If even a pregnancy cannot be detected, how can it be deemed valuable?&quot; Alas! My sincere efforts, aimed at protecting the couple and their child, only led to slander; what more could there be! It is only because I was slandered by the so-called physicians of this world that I was able to gain recognition.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　噎膈一证，必以忧愁、思虑、积劳、积郁，或酒色过度损伤而成。盖忧思过度则气结，气结则施化不行；酒色过度则伤阴，阴伤则精血枯涸。气不行，则噎膈病于上；精血枯涸，则燥结病于下。且凡人之脏气，胃司受纳，脾主运化，而肾为水火之宅，化生之本，今既食饮停隔不行，或大便燥结不通，岂非运化失职，血脉不通之为病乎？而运行血脉之权，其在上者，非脾而何？其在下者，非肾而何？矧少年少见此证，而惟中衰耗伤者多有之，此其为虚为实概可知矣。故凡治此者，欲舍根本而言捷径，又安望其有成功也！　　噎膈、反胃二证，丹溪谓其名虽不同，病出一体，若乎似矣。<a id="orig-74p" href="#trans-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>然而实有不同也。盖反胃者，食犹能人，入而反出，故曰反胃；噎膈者，隔塞不通，食不能下，故曰噎膈。食入反出者，以阳虚不能化也，可补可温，其治犹易；食不得下者，以气结不能行也，或开或助，治有两难，此其轻重之有不同也。且凡病反胃者多能食，病噎膈者不能食。故噎膈之病病于胸臆上焦，而反胃之病则病于中下二焦，此其见证之有不同也。所以反胃之治，多宜益火之源，以助化功；噎膈之治，多宜调养心脾，以舒结气。此其证候既有不同，故诊治亦当分类也。　　噎膈证多有便结不通者，《内经》曰：三阳结谓之膈。张子和曰：三阳者，大肠、小肠、膀胱也。结谓热结也。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>小肠热结则血脉燥，大肠热结则不圊，膀胱热结则津液涸，三阳既结则前后闭濇。下既不通，必反上行，所以噎食不下，纵下而复出，此阳火不下推而上行也。愚按此说，则大不为然。夫结之为义，《内经》原非言热，如本篇曰：阴阳结邪，多阴少阳，曰石水。又举痛论曰：思则气结。是岂以结为热耶？且热则流通，寒则凝结，此自阴阳之至理。故凡霜凝冰结，惟寒冽有之，而热则无也。此天道之显然可见者。人身阴阳之理，无非是耳。惟人不能知，所以多误也。矧《内经》之言三阳结者，乃止言小肠膀胱，全与大肠无涉。盖三阳者，太阳也，手太阳小肠也，足太阳膀胱也。<a id="orig-76p" href="#trans-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>小肠属火，膀胱属水，火不化则阳气不行而传导失职，水不化则阴气不行而清浊不分，此皆致结之由也。子和不察，而遂以三阳之结，尽言为热，以致后世悉传为火，岂理也哉！然人之病结者，本非一端，盖气能结，血亦能结；阳能结，阴亦能结。余非曰结必皆寒而全无热也，但阴结阳结，证自不同，有不可不辨耳。夫阳结者热结也，因火盛烁阴，所以干结，此惟表邪传里，及阳明实热者乃有之。然热结者，必有烦渴发热等证，洪大滑实等脉，最易辨也。若下有结闭，而上无热证，此阴结耳，安得谓之热耶？盖阴结者，正以命门无火，气不化精，所以凝结于下，而治节不行，此惟内伤血气，败及真阴者乃有之，即噎膈之属是也。夫噎膈之证，人皆知为内伤也。<a id="orig-77p" href="#trans-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>内伤至此，其脏气之健否为何如，而犹云为热，岂必使元阳尽去而别有生生之道乎？噫！此余之所不解也，不得不辨！　　噎膈证古人多认为寒，自刘河间治膈气噎食用三承气汤，张子和以三阳之结尽论为热，且云人之溢食，初未遽然也，或伤酒食，或胃热欲吐，医者不察本原，投下香、桂、胡椒、丁香之属。设如伤酒伤食，正可攻逐，岂可言虚，便将热补？素热之人，三阳必结，食必上潮，医氏犹云胃寒不纳，燔针灼艾，三阳转结，岁月弥深，遂成噎膈。余味此言，不能无惑。盖噎膈由于枯槁，本非实热之证，三承气汤尚可用乎？此河间之见有弗确也。矧酒肉过多者，未必遂成噎膈，而噎膈之病，又岂皆素热之人乎？此子和之见有未然也。<a id="orig-78p" href="#trans-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>自后丹溪遂承二子之说，而大辟《局方》之非，谓气之初病，或饮食不谨，或外冒风雨，或内感七情，或食味过厚，偏助阳气，积成膈热，或资禀充实，表密无汗，或性急易怒，肝火上炎，以致津液不行，气为之病，或痞或痛，或噫腐气，或吞酸，或(食曹)杂，或膨满，不求原本，便认为寒，遽以辛香燥热之剂投之，数贴时暂得快，以为神方，厚味仍前，不节七情，反复相仍，旧病被劫，暂开浊液，易于攒聚，或半月或一月，前病复作，医者不察，犹执为冷，翻思前药，随手得快，颙俟久服，可以温脾壮胃，消积行气，以冀一旦豁然。不思胃为水谷之海，清和则能受，脾为消化之器，清和则能运。今反得香熟之偏助，劫之而愈，复作复劫，延绵至久，而成噎膈。展转深痼，良可哀悯。此丹溪之说也，使后人见之，无不以为至论。即余初年，亦未尝不加钦服，而今则日见其非矣。<a id="orig-79p" href="#trans-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>何也？试观所叙病原，其有然者，有不然者，顾难缕指而辨也。但以此证而力指为热，能无谬乎？且既云燥热之剂，随手得快，则固非无效也。夫燥热已能奏效，岂真火证而燥热能效乎？盖脾土恶湿，故燥之可也。火能生土，故热之亦可也。温燥扶阳，此自脾家正治，而必欲非之，以致后人之疑，似属矫矣。若谓厚味七情，仍前不节，以致愈而复作，此谁之咎也？而亦可归之药误乎？又如脾胃清和，能受能运之说，此实至理，谁不云然？但余之所谓清和者，则与丹溪不同。抑又何也？盖丹溪所言者，惟恐火之盛；余之所言者，惟恐阳之衰。异同若此，人将焉信？请以天人之理证之，何如？夫天人之所同赖者，惟此阳气而已。故经曰：天气清静，光明者也。又曰：阳气者，若天与日，失其所则折寿而不彰，故天运当以日光明。<a id="orig-80p" href="#trans-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>由此言之，则六合清和止此太阳为之用。故阳气胜，则温暖光明，而万类咸亨，非清和乎？阴气胜则风霾晦暝，而升沉闭塞，非不清和乎？且春夏万物之盛，非阳盛之化乎？秋冬万物之衰，非阳衰之兆乎？人之所赖以生者，亦惟此耳。故人于饮食朝入口而午化尽，午入胃而暮化尽，此其中焦之热，亦何异大烹之鼎，必如是者才是清和，是即平人之常，乃正所谓胃气也。使朝食而午不饥，午食而晚不饥，饮食化迟，便是阳亏之候。而矧乎全不能行、全不能化者，医且犹云有火，岂必并此化源尽行扑灭而后可，亦堪嗟矣！夫天下之理，本无二三，而或是或非，何多朱紫？余每欲言，未尝不知自反，但于最疑处，则不得不呈其丑，又安得轩岐再起，以为我一正哉？尝闻之康节先生曰：欲为天下屠龙手，肯读人间非圣书？其感慨深矣。岂不信然！岂不信然！　　论治<a id="orig-81p" href="#trans-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>　　凡治噎膈大法，当以脾肾为主。盖脾主运化，而脾之大络布于胸膈；肾主津液，而肾之气化主乎二阴。故上焦之噎膈，其责在脾；下焦之闭结，其责在肾。治脾者宜从温养，治肾者宜从滋润，舍此二法，他无捷径矣。然泰交之道，天居地下，故必三阳出土而后万物由之，可见脾土之母由下而升。褚侍中曰：外病疗内，上病救下。辨病脏之虚实，通病脏之子母。斯言得矣，不可忽也！　　治噎膈之法，凡气血俱虚者，宜五福饮及十全大补汤；脾虚于上者，宜四君子汤；脾虚兼寒者，宜五君子煎；脾肺营虚血燥者，宜生姜汁煎；阴虚于下者，宜左归饮、大营煎；阴中之阳虚者，宜右归饮加当归，或右归丸、八味地黄丸之类。皆治本之法也。<a id="orig-82p" href="#trans-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>　　噎膈初起，微虚者，宜温胃饮加当归、厚朴。如果痰气不清，上焦多滞者，宜二陈汤加厚朴，或六安煎亦可；如气有不顺，或兼胸腹微痛者，宜加减二陈汤暂解之。凡初觉饮食微有不行，而年不甚衰者，宜速用大健脾丸，或木香、人参、生姜、枳朮丸，以调脾气为上策，或芍药枳朮丸亦可。　　噎膈便结者，但察其无火无滞，而止因血燥阴虚者，宜五福饮或大营煎，加酒洗肉苁蓉二三钱，同煎服。或以豕膏渐润其下，而以调脾等剂治其上，最为良法。或多服牛羊乳酥之类，以滋其精液，使之渐润，毋欲速也！如果气血未至甚损，而下焦胀闭之甚者，则不得不为暂通，轻则玉烛散、人参利膈丸或搜风顺气丸，甚则大黄甘草汤，酌宜用之。<a id="orig-83p" href="#trans-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>　　用温补以治噎膈，人必疑其壅滞而且嫌迂缓，不知中气败证，此其为甚，使非速救根本，则脾气何由再健？设用温补而噎塞愈甚，则不得不曲为加减，然必须千方百计，务从元气中酌其所宜，庶可保全也。若用补之后，虽或未见功效，但得全无窒碍，便是药病相投。且此病最不易治，既能受补，必须多服，方得渐效，以收全功。不可性急致疑，一暴十寒以自误也。若急图目前之快，但使行滞开胃，而妄用大黄、芒硝、三棱、莪朮、(艹舌)蒌、桃仁、滚痰丸之属，非惟不能见效，必致胃气日败，万无生理矣。此徒速其亡，不可不省也！　　诸家治噎，古法用人参、黄芪以补元气，御米、粟米以解毒实胃，竹沥以清痰散结，干姜以温中，生姜以去秽，牛羊乳以养血润液，蜜汁、当归以润燥，用此数者为主治，其余因证而增减之，俱是良法。<a id="orig-84p" href="#trans-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>凡肥胖之人，鲜有噎证，间或有之，宜用二陈加人参、白朮之类。血虚瘦弱之人，用四物合二陈加桃仁、红花、韭汁、童便、牛羊乳之类。七情郁结而成噎膈者，二陈合香附、抚芎、木香、槟榔、(艹舌)蒌、砂仁之类。饮酒人患噎膈，以二陈加黄连，砂仁、砂糖之类。胸膈有热者，加黄连、黄芩、桔梗、(艹舌)蒌之类。脾不磨者，加神曲、砂仁、麦芽之类，以助消导。噎膈大便燥结之甚者，必用大黄，或用二陈汤加酒蒸大黄、桃仁以润之，乃急则治标之法也。或用四物汤加桃仁、童便、韭汁，多饮牛羊乳为上策。按古人治噎之法，大略已尽于此，虽其中有宜有不宜者，亦并录之，以备采择。　　凡年高患此者，多不可治，以血气虚败故也。粪如羊矢者，不可治，大肠无血也。吐痰如蟹沫者，不可治，脾气败也。腹中疼痛，(食曹)杂如刀割者，不可治，营虚之极，血竭于中也。<a id="orig-85p" href="#trans-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>　　　　　反胃论证</p>

<p><strong>On the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When Yang develops a disease, there is diminished energy, frequent coughing, and diarrhea. Its transmission affects the heart and causes chest pain, which in turn leads to obstruction at the diaphragm. [Note: Yang here refers to Shao Yang. Shao Yang governs the initial vital energy; when ill, this energy is decreased. The fire of Shao Yang generates energy, and if the energy is low, the fire becomes vigorous, thus causing coughing. The malevolent Wood and Fire impair Earth, leading to diarrhea. A deficiency in the heart then causes pain. The pathogen resides in the stomach, thus blocking the diaphragm and causing obstruction.] When the Three Yangs are obstructed, it is termed a diaphragm condition. [Note: The Three Yangs refer to Tai Yang. The energy of Tai Yang arises from the bladder, emerging from within the diaphragm to the chest and ribs; when there is a stagnation of Yang energy, the diaphragm’s energy cannot flow, thus preventing food and drink from descending.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Six Energies and Organ Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>When a person has a major illness in the lesser yang, it is one fold; in the greater yang, it is two folds; in the yang brightness, it is three folds; and if it is four folds or more, it is called excessive yang. <em>[Note: One fold in the lesser yang represents the spring rise of energy. The greater yang represents summer, the yang brightness represents autumn, and four folds or more indicates excessive yang, thus termed excessive yang.]</em> </p>
<p>When a person has a major illness in the absolute yin, it is one fold; in the lesser yin, it is two folds; in the greater yin, it is three folds; and if it is four folds or more, it is called barrier yin. <em>[Note: Four folds or more indicates excessive yin, thus termed barrier yin.]</em> </p>
<p>When both the pulse at the person’s greeting and the pulse at the wrist are at least four folds above, it is called barrier excess. The pulse of barrier excess is weak and cannot reach the essence of the universe; thus, death ensues. <em>[Note: Both being four folds or more indicates both yin and yang are at their extremes. When both are excessive but out of balance, they cannot connect to the essence of both yin and yang in the universe, leading to death.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on Blood, Qi, Form, and Will</strong></p>
<p>Suffering of the form leads to suffering of the will; illnesses arise in the throat, treated with sweet medicine. <em>[Note: Worries affect the heart and exhaustion affects the physical form, thus both yin and yang, as well as qi and blood, become harmed, causing illnesses in the throat, and sweet medicine is advised to regulate the spleen and stomach.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on Distinction Between Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>When there are blockages and closures, causing lack of communication Up and Down, it leads to sudden worries as illness. <em>[Note: When the middle burner is blocked, the qi between the upper and lower parts is impeded; this leads to the five stagnations as illness.]</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Qi Collapse</strong></p>
<p>When the liver transfers cold to the heart, it causes mania within the diaphragm.<br>[Note: The yang combines with yang, hence the mania. The liver&#39;s evil energy rises to the heart, causing obstruction in the diaphragm.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Pain</strong></p>
<p>Fear causes the essence to retreat; when it retreats, the upper burner is closed. With the closure, the Qi returns, and as it returns, the lower burner becomes distended, hence the Qi does not circulate.<br>[Note: Fear harms the kidneys, causing the essence and Qi to descend instead of rising. The zhong region functions as the sea of Qi, emerging from the lungs to control respiration, originating from the lower burner; thus, when the essence retreats, the upper burner is closed, and the rising Qi returns to the lower burner, leading to distension there. The Qi between the upper and lower does not connect, thus the Qi does not circulate.]</p>
<p>Thinking stores the heart and anchors the spirit; the vital Qi remains stagnant and does not move, resulting in Qi stagnation.<br>[Note: Through thinking, the heart spirit remains internally stored, leading to the vital Qi being stagnant and thus causing Qi stagnation.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of stomach wind include a sweaty neck, aversion to wind, inability to consume food and drink, obstruction in the diaphragm, a swollen abdomen, distension upon losing clothing, and diarrhea from eating cold food, with a diagnosis of a slender body and a large abdomen.<br>[Note: The inability to consume food and drink, along with obstruction in the diaphragm and a distended abdomen, indicates that the stomach is affected by evil forces. If the stomach Qi is insufficient, the body&#39;s front feels cold, and the abdomen appears distended, leading to a cold appearance. Diarrhea from consuming cold food indicates damage to the stomach Qi. The abdomen relates to the stomach&#39;s outer border, thus a slim body with a large abdomen results.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>The stomach pulse is deep and drum-like, the stomach is outwardly distended, the heart pulse is small, hard, and rapid; these are all signs of depletion of the diaphragm. 【Note: The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that &quot;drum-like&quot; indicates a lack of qi. The &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot; says that &quot;if drum-like, there is no blood; if large, it is deficiency.&quot; This deficiency of blood and qi internally and externally leads to the depletion of the diaphragm.

During the year of Jueyin in spring, the wind-indulgent prevails, causing people to suffer chills and shaky sensations, heart pain and fullness in the sides, urgent discomfort in the abdomen, inability to ingest food or drink, obstruction in the throat, and vomiting upon eating. The triumph of Jueyin manifests as pain in the stomach and heart, ache in the sides, and severe vomiting, along with obstruction in the throat. 【Note: All of these manifest due to the overpowering of wind and wood, thus causing illness in the spleen.】 The recovery of Taiyin reveals that excess moisture leads to heaviness and fullness in the body, inability to digest food and drink, and rising yin qi causing discomfort in the chest. 【Note: All of these are illnesses caused by yin and dampness.】<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the realm governed by Lesser Yang, there are heart pain and stomach pain, with counterflow and obstruction in the diaphragm, signifying rapid occurrences. <strong>[Note: Heart pain arises from disorders of the pericardium. Stomach pain results from the wood element overcoming the earth. The earth, located centrally, does not flow through; thus, there is counterflow above and below.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the five organs are not harmonious, the seven orifices do not function; when the six bowels are not harmonious, abscesses arise. Therefore, if the evils reside in the bowels, the yang vessels are unbalanced; if the yang vessels are unbalanced, qi is retained; if qi is retained, yang energy becomes excessive. When yang energy is excessive, the yin vessels are impaired; if the yin vessels are impaired, blood is retained; if blood is retained, yin energy becomes excessive. When yin energy is excessive, yang energy cannot nourish; hence it is called “closure.” When yang energy is excessive, yin energy cannot nourish; hence it is called “stagnation.” When both yin and yang are excessive, they cannot support each other, so it is called “closure and stagnation.” Those in the state of closure and stagnation cannot die at their appointed time. [Note: &quot;Closure&quot; refers to closure of the yin internally, and &quot;stagnation&quot; to obstruction of the yang externally. In such a state, both yin and yang are excessive and cannot nourish each other, hence it is called closure and stagnation, leading to death before its appointed time.]</p>
<p>When the pulse at the person’s external gate is fourfold, both large and rapid, it is called &quot;overflowing yang.&quot; Overflowing yang represents external stagnation, indicating death without remedy. One must carefully examine its origin and result, check its coldness and heat, to confirm the diseases of the organs. [Note: Overflowing yang refers to the overwhelming presence of yang qi within the vessels, resulting from the combination of qi and blood.] When the pulse at the inch (cun) position is fourfold, it is termed &quot;internal closure.&quot; Internal closure also presents as large and rapid, indicating death without remedy. One must carefully examine its origins in temperature to confirm the diseases of the organs.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Upper Diaphragm Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Qi is what constitutes the upper diaphragm, where food and drink enter and then return out. I have already understood this. The worm constitutes the lower diaphragm; the lower diaphragm releases food and drink at the appropriate time, but I have not yet grasped its meaning, and I wish to hear it completely! Qi Bo replied: When emotions are out of balance, when food and drink are irregular, and when temperatures are inappropriate, then cold juice flows within the intestines. When it flows within the intestines, the worms become cold; when the worms are cold, they accumulate. When they become lodged in the lower passage, the intestines and stomach are filled with stagnation, and the protective Qi fails to nourish, allowing evil Qi to dwell there. When a person eats, the worms consume the food. When the worms consume the food, the lower passage becomes deficient; when the lower passage is deficient, the evil Qi overcomes it. Stagnation persists, and if it remains, sores develop. When sores develop, the lower passage contracts. If the sore is inside the passage, it causes deep pain; if the sore is outside, it results in external swelling and superficial pain, with the skin over the sore being hot. </p>
<p>[Note: This arises from emotional imbalance, irregularities in food and drink, and inappropriate temperature. If the illness is located in the upper diaphragm, food and drink will enter and return. If the illness is in the lower diaphragm, food will only return at the appropriate time. The stomach is the sea of water, grains, and blood Qi. When affected by external evils, juices and froths seep and remain outside the intestines; if they do not disperse, they accumulate over time. If due to internal injury, the juices and froths stay within the intestines, they gradually soak and form sores. Sores in the interior cause deep pain; those in the exterior cause superficial pain, and the skin over the sores must be hot.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>Guan Ge</p>
<p>The pulse can be too full, insufficient, have yin and yang intermingled, and can be excessive or deficient, related or unconnected—what does this mean? Indeed. The pulse before the guan (barrier) represents the movement of yang. The pulse should reveal nine parts and one inch to be deep; if it is excessive, it is called too full, if it is reduced, it is termed insufficient, thus entering the measurement scale as covering or unblocking, which reflects the yang pulse. Therefore, it is said that excess and overflow represent the true pulse of the organs, leading to death without illness. The classic says that qi exclusively circulates in the five organs, without engaging in the six bowels; why is that? Indeed. Qi flows as water does, without pause, hence the yin pulse nourishes the five organs while the yang pulse nourishes the six bowels, resembling a ring without end, where its course is unknown, ending and beginning anew. When there is no overflow, human qi remains warm in the organs and moist on the skin.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment for Stomach Reflux</strong></p>
<p>In the Vomiting chapter it says: A question was asked: If a patient has a rapid pulse, and the rapidity indicates heat, why do they vomit after consuming grains? The master replied: This is to induce sweating, leading to a slight yang, causing the diaphragm qi to be empty, resulting in a rapid pulse. The rapid pulse represents an external heat that cannot digest food, due to coolness and emptiness in the stomach. A wiry pulse indicates emptiness; the stomach qi is insufficient, leading to morning food being vomited in the evening, which is termed stomach reflux. Cold accumulates above, but the physician treats below, resulting in a wiry pulse, hence it is called empty. The pulse at the inch is thin and rapid; thin means no qi, no qi leads to a deficiency of nourishment, and deficiency of nourishment results in cold in the chest. </p>
<p>The pulse at the foot yang is floating and slippery; floating indicates emptiness, and emptiness damages the spleen. Injury to the spleen does not digest food, leading to morning food being vomited in the evening or evening food in the morning, with undigested grains, termed stomach reflux. A tight and slippery pulse indicates a difficult condition to treat. If vomiting occurs immediately after eating, one should administer Da Huang Gan Cao Decoction. For those with stomach reflux and vomiting, Da Ban Xia Decoction is prescribed. For individuals with stomach reflux and thirst desiring water, Fu Ling Ze Xie Decoction is recommended. For all types of vomiting where grains cannot descend, Xiao Ban Xia Decoction should be used.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When yang energy rises but does not descend, it is called &quot;negation&quot;; when yin energy descends but does not rise, it is also called &quot;negation.&quot; When yang energy descends but does not rise, it is called &quot;stagnation&quot;; when yin energy rises but does not descend, it is likewise called &quot;stagnation.&quot; The terms negation and stagnation imply that yin and yang do not mutually support each other. When yang rushes upward, it scorches the spleen and lungs, leading to jaundice, characterized by yellow and red colors, all arising from the extreme of yang. When yin moves downward, it freezes the kidneys and liver, resulting in syncope, characterized by blue and black colors, all stemming from the extreme of yin. Jaundice pertains to yellow jaundice, and syncope refers to cold syncope, both arising from the obstruction of the interaction between yin and yang. Where yang is scorched, treat with water; where yin is obstructed, assist with fire. This illustrates the way in which yin and yang complement each other.</p>
<p>Pulses: The strong pulse signifies heat in the chest before the guan, and upon reaching the guan, it transforms into nausea, heavy as thousands.</p>
<p>Regarding the obstruction discourse: &quot;Records of Ancient and Modern Examples&quot; states: The five types of obstruction are due to worry, labor, food, and thought. Qi obstruction relates to palpitations and a lack of flow, leading to nausea and chest pain. Worry obstruction occurs when oppressive conditions cause reverse qi, resulting in palpitations below the heart and cold extremities. Labor obstruction leads to prolonged discomfort in the side and fullness below the ribs, causing cold extremities unable to warm themselves. Food obstruction happens when little is consumed, yet there is constant discomfort and pain in the chest, impeding breath. Thought obstruction results in palpitations, absent-mindedness, and restless eyes. All these arose from concerns, anger, and cold qi entering the chest and sides.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Anti-Stomach Acidity</strong></p>
<p>When the stomach is tight, the person feels fullness in the chest and cannot eat, leading to vomiting. If this vomiting stops, food cannot be ingested. If one continues to experience this, it is termed &quot;stomach reversal,&quot; hence the tightness is slightly exacerbated. The pulse at the foot yang is floating and tight; a floating pulse indicates deficiency, while tightness harms the spleen. When the spleen is harmed, digestion fails, resulting in morning vomiting of last night&#39;s food and evening vomiting of the day&#39;s meal. If food fails to digest, it is called &quot;stomach reversal.&quot; A tight and weak pulse at the foot yang indicates a difficult-to-treat condition.</p>
<p><strong>Esophageal Obstruction</strong> </p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that a knot in the yang pulse is called an obstruction. This pertains to the coalescing of qi and spirit as yang. When relaxed, qi and spirit are calm; when overworked, they deplete. If there are inappropriate temperatures or imbalanced foods, or emotional disturbances, both qi and spirit become agitated, causing the yang qi to knot, while the yin qi becomes disturbed. This results in disharmony between yin and yang, leading to organ disorders. If an obstruction occurs in the chest, it is called &quot;obstructive qi,&quot; and if it remains in the throat, it leads to five types of choking. The five obstructions are caused by worries, anger, cold, heat, and qi disturbances; the five choke types come from worries, overthinking, labor, and eating issues. The symptoms include chest tightness, feelings of oppression, nausea, choking sensations, hindrance in eating, chest pain radiating to the back, discomfort below the ribs, a feeling of restlessness, and difficulty in swallowing. The treatment method involves regulating yin and yang, transforming phlegm, dispersing qi, achieving balance between yin and yang, which allows for smooth qi and phlegm downwards, resolving obstructions. Moreover, when there is deficiency below and qi rising, it causes a firm fullness in the heart area, discomfort in the muscles, pain like a needle, and difficulty bending or stretching, known as chest obstruction.<br><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<pre><code>        An Analysis of the Division of the Ten and the Fifteen Classes of Disorders
</code></pre>
<p>Disorders began with the nest of the Chao clan. The loss of the essence also began with this nest. Why is this? Laozi said: &quot;Less leads to gain, more leads to confusion.&quot; Moreover, it is commonly said that choking on food is connected to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which says little more, only that the three yangs belong to the diaphragm. The three yangs refer to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder. &quot;Congested&quot; means heat accumulation. If there is heat accumulation in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; if in the large intestine, there is inability to defecate; if in the bladder, bodily fluids dry up. When the three yangs are congested, both front and back are obstructed. When the lower passage does not open, it must reverse and move upwards, resulting in food not being able to descend properly, even if it does, it comes back up. The stomach is known as the sea of water and grains, daily receiving the new to replace the old, leading to regular bowel movements. Now those who suffer from choking are often unable to pass stool for three, five, or even five to seven days, which clearly indicates a deviation from this regularity.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Is it not the case that the three Yang energies are all congealed below, causing the large intestine to dry up, leading to the foods consumed being rejected by the throat? Even if they enter the great warehouse, they still emerge from the throat; this is the Yang fire not being pushed down but instead rising. Therefore, the classics say: &quot;When Shao Yang reaches, it causes vomiting and leakage, and food does not go down.&quot; Isn&#39;t this reasoning clear?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the &quot;Treatise on Qi Disorders&quot; states: &quot;When the liver transmits cold to the heart, it causes madness in the diaphragm. The Yang energy is weakened by cold; hence, there is impeded digestion and obstruction in the diaphragm; this is due to the interaction of Yang and cold, not solely dependent on cold.&quot; The &quot;Six Qi and Organ Patterns&quot; also states: &quot;The pulse of &#39;Ren Ying&#39; above four fullnesses signifies an obstruction of Yang.&quot; Wang Taipu remarked: &quot;When Yang is at its peak, it obstructs and rejects, causing food to fail to enter.&quot; The &quot;Zheng Li Lun&quot; states: &quot;Obstruction causes vomiting and regurgitation.&quot; Thus, the diaphragm must also be in a state of obstruction.</p>
<p>Later generations hastily divided conditions into five types of choking, attributing them to worries over Qi, food, and labor. Later still, they divided them into ten types of obstruction and five types of choking, leading to a plethora of classifications and increasing confusion. The issue of overeating in a person does not usually manifest all at once. Initially, it may cause harm from alcohol and food, or stomach heat might induce vomiting, or dizziness from wind might lead to vomiting.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The physicians do not investigate the root cause; they burn ginger in the fire and boil cinnamon in broth. Though cloves have not yet finished, cardamom follows; though spikenard has not yet finished, pepper follows. Even if it is said to harmonize the stomach, the stomach is originally not cold; even if it is said to nourish the stomach, the stomach is originally not deficient. If it is due to harm from drinking, one can only eliminate the drink; if it is due to harm from eating, one can only eliminate the food. How can one claim deficiency and then use heating tonics? Those who originally have no excess heat are still not within the scope of treatment. Those with pre-existing heat in the body will inevitably have the three yangs converge. Once the three yangs converge, food will inevitably rise. The physician still claims the stomach is cold and cannot accept; burning needles into flesh, moxibustion scorching the skin, enduring countless agonies. The heat of the three yangs converging is clear, but treatment is difficult; merely withdrawing stimuli is of utmost importance. It is like trying to stop boiling water with more heat—painful and counterproductive. Over time, this has led to mistakes by physicians. People say to descend the yang and nourish the yin, opening the eyes and sticking out the tongue, fearing harm to the original energy, but all is merely about maintaining harmony, obstructed and unresponsive, without any way forward. The intestines should be unobstructed, hence the noises they make. When the intestines are obstructed, it leads to choking illness.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Traditionally, there are five types of constriction in the diaphragm, with ingredients like ginger and cinnamon; and ten types of obstruction with additions of certain substances. Now, I have dismissed those methods, believing them to be questionable, allowing future scholars to judge. Some say that worry and anger can cause stagnation; can they be treated? I say: worry and anger cause blockages, identical to significant distress. Master Tai Cang noted that once established, these methods become obsolete and won&#39;t return for a thousand years. </p>
<p>In our time, Liu Hejian&#39;s treatment for obstructed qi and food, using the Three承气 Decoction, stands out uniquely in modernity. I now suggest to future generations that when using medicine, they should carefully consider the dosage. If the obstruction has persisted for a long time, do not attack aggressively. Even if one manages to resolve the obstruction, one must be cautious of future issues. It is best to first moisten and nourish the body with smaller doses of medicinal pills, gradually increasing them until the blockage naturally eases. </p>
<p>If there is choking or obstruction, resulting in phlegm, one can lightly use bitter and sour herbs to gently induce flow, and then treat accordingly; the medicine will be more effective. If that does not work, one can guide with honey and salt, ensuring a continuous interaction between the two medicines, promoting dispersion and consumption of stagnation. Do not use ba dou, as it exhausts the body&#39;s natural essence, drying up fluids and leaving toxins within. Some say this condition should be treated by expelling it; however, expelling it can lead to emptiness and discomfort.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment of Choking and Blockage</strong></p>
<p>When the throat is blocked, preventing yang qi from emerging, it is called blockage; when yin qi cannot descend, it is called choking. Blockage and choking oppose the flow between the throat and chest, causing stagnation in the channels; then the mouth may open and the eyes may bulge, leading to a near suffocation feeling. First, one should use medicinal herbs with spicy and sweet flavors that are entirely yang to stimulate the stomach qi and address the root cause, supplemented by herbs to relieve the blockage. During the cold months, when the yin energy greatly strengthens external yin pathogens, one should add Wu Zhu Yu, which has a strongly hot and spicy flavor, to the primary medicine to dispel the cold yin qi. In the hot months, when yang is strong, add Qing Pi, Chen Pi, Yi Zhi, and Huang Lian to scatter the cold qi and release the upward counterflow of yin fire, or combine with Xiao Pi Wan and Zi Shen Wan. The Zi Shen Wan consists of Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, and slightly added Rou Gui, totaling three ingredients. Alternatively, one might add Huang Lian to create a special pill, producing seventy or eighty pills, to be taken on an empty stomach until the food from the previous meal is completely digested, followed by light and delicious foods to prevent stagnation in the stomach.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Methods for Using Medicinal Herbs to Treat Impediments in the Throat and Diaphragm Causing Discomfort</p>
<p>The &quot;Acupuncture Classic&quot; states: For stomach illnesses, there is abdominal distension, pain in the epigastric region, discomfort in both sides of the chest, impediment in the throat and diaphragm, and inability to consume food or drink. The point to be selected is Sanli. The throat is the gateway for swallowing food, while the diaphragm separates the heart and lungs. When there is an obstruction, the ascending and descending vital energies cannot communicate freely. It is also said that if clear energy is in the lower region, it leads to food retention, resulting in diarrhea that is yellow and like paste, indicating that grains are not being digested. Conversely, if turbid energy rises, it causes abdominal distension, leading to difficulties in defecation; either constipation or diarrhea may ensue. When the turbid energy is stuck above and should descend but does not, the yin energy drawn in by the kidneys and liver cannot move downwards and instead remains trapped, causing the stomach&#39;s energy to rebel upwards, resulting in nausea, vomiting, or belching. This is due to the upward surge of yin fire conflicting with the incoming energy, preventing food from being ingested. All of this is caused by the fire of obstructed energy, reversing the flow of the stomach&#39;s channels upwards.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the clear energy descends, it leads to symptoms of food retention. On days when the stomach energy is not ill, it should rise to support the heart and lungs and nourish the channels. However, due to irregularities in diet and excessive labor on the body, the heart fire occupies the earth’s position, weakening the stomach energy and causing it to sink into the yin. Thus, when grains enter but cannot ascend or descend, it results in food retention. The space between the throat and diaphragm is severely obstructed, preventing communication, all of which is caused by the counterflow of the penetrating vessel. Stomach ailments cause upward disruption in both flanks, and with the throat and diaphragm not open, food cannot descend, so one must choose points on the stomach meridian (Zu San Li). The &quot;Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states that when clear and turbid energies are mixed and disordered in the chest, it is called great disturbance. Great disturbance refers to confusion. When energy does not circulate properly, it is a critical condition. If not urgently addressed, various changes will occur. </p>
<p>Treatment principle: When there is insufficient yang energy and excess yin energy, one should first tonify the yang and then drain the yin; this ensures that yang energy rises in the yang aspect before draining yin. In the spring and summer months, when yang energy is present in the channels, one should enhance the meridians and eliminate blood stasis; in autumn and winter when yang energy is subdued, one must first treat the internal organs.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

Illness that arises at this time is supported by the heavens to strengthen the righteous qi and weaken the evil qi, allowing for self-healing without treatment.

<p>For instance, if there is obstruction in the diaphragm and throat with severe congestion, treatment should focus on using &quot;Li Ge Wan&quot; to clear lung fire and then follow with &quot;Huang Qi Bu Zhong Tang&quot; for nourishment. If there are symptoms like weakness or numbness in the legs, stumbling when walking, a tendency to lean or fall, pain and lack of strength in the arms, or shortness of breath, one should prepare a soup with Huang Qi, Ren Shen, Gan Cao, Bai Zhu, Cang Zhu, Ze Xie, Zhu Ling, Fu Ling, and Chen Pi, and take five to sixty pills of a kidney-nourishing formula.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting can generally be attributed to four causes: blood deficiency, qi deficiency, heat, and phlegm. In cases with combined ailments, one must use leeks juice, children&#39;s urine, bamboo juice, cow or sheep milk, and ginger juice; for qi deficiency, it is necessary to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction, and the right wrist pulse will be weak; for blood deficiency, add children&#39;s urine to the Four Substances Decoction, and the left wrist pulse will be weak. Do not use aromatic and dry medicines, as their use would be fatal. It is advisable to favor light tastes.</p>
<p>To treat vomiting, use three qian of coptis, ginger juice soaked and stir-fried, two qian of hawthorn flesh, and two qian of Baohe pills, grind into a powder, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds, coated with animal fat, then boil it in ginseng soup mixed with bamboo juice for a second boiling, yielding sixty pills.</p>
<p>If there is phlegm, the Erchen Decoction should be the main treatment; the pulse at the inch position will be deep or large. If there is qi stagnation, it is advisable to use medicine that opens up and guides qi; the pulse at the inch position will be deep and thin. For internal deficiency with yin fire rising and causing vomiting, treat the yin fire.</p>
<p>For the young, the Four Substances Decoction clears the stomach. Blood dryness leads to constipation. Although the elderly might not need treatment, they should use ginseng and atractylodes to prevent qi deficiency and stomach weakness. In cases of qi deficiency, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with reed root and children&#39;s urine, or ginseng and poria powder, or leeks juice mixed with cow or sheep milk, or even donkey urine. Accumulated blood stagnating within must be resolved. If the stool is hard, treatment is difficult. Encourage eating rabbit meat for easier bowel movements.</p>
<p>Vomiting is akin to esophageal blockage; indeed, esophageal blockage is a progression of vomiting. The &quot;Elucidation&quot; mentions that the elderly should not be treated. If the stool resembles sheep droppings, it should definitely not be treated, as the large intestine contains no blood.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

Now, what is called cold qi, stagnant qi, rebellious qi, and rising qi, all stem from the lung being invaded by fire pathogens, causing the qi to transform upwards, with ascent but no descent, suffocating and steaming the clear pathways, to the extent that the upper burner fails to receive, the middle burner fails to transform, and the lower burner fails to penetrate, leading to changes such as vomiting, esophageal obstruction, phlegm and fluid accumulation, retrograde swallowing, and sour regurgitation.

I say: The five organs each possess their fire, ignited by the five emotions; this fire rises accordingly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a patient claims that cold energy rises from below, what can it be but cold? I said: The ascending energy emerges from the liver, while the intermingled fire arises from below, producing intense heat, which the patient perceives as cold; it is not true cold. When the fire is at its peak, it resembles water — the accumulation of excessive heat leads to an overabundance of Yang and a deficiency of Yin, hence this symptom of cold arising from energy is a misconception stemming from misguided theories. </p>
<p>If the illness truly arises from cold, it should be treated with remedies to dispel cold. Why resort to conventional methods using pungent, aromatic, and warming prescriptions? Ignoring the need for adaptability leads to potentially misleading treatments. Some say that for rising energy, one should use medicines like Heixi Dan, Yangzheng Dan, and Yangqi Dan to stabilize it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fire from both sides stirs and moves, its energy rising along with the flame, ascending without descending—who can resist it? Now, by employing heavy dan pills to bring it down, the energy becomes stagnant and transforms into damp phlegm. The nature of the dan is hot and dry; damp phlegm is thus affected and temporarily resolved, resulting in relief. When dan toxicity accumulates over time, it further fuels the fiery excess, depleting yin blood and causing even more ascendance. Common people favor warmth, remaining oblivious and falling victim to this disaster—many are affected. Some say: the heaviness of dan pills seeks to descend yet does ascend; how then can this be resolved? I say: administer pungent coolness to dispel and use pungent warmth to subdue liver evils; treat with salty coldness, supplemented by sweet warmth, collecting bitterness and sweetness, harmonizing with mild sweetness to nourish yin blood. When yang is self-sustaining and yin and yang are harmonized, what is there left to ascend? The methods of ancient sages are not far removed; I will not elaborate further. Some say: various airs and drinks, along with symptoms like nausea, sour regurgitation, and stomach distress—are not adequately addressed in the “Jufang” text; I understand this.

Phlegm mixed with stagnant blood has formed a mass, leading to symptoms such as fullness, pain, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing, along with a range of issues arising from these conditions.

Consequently, both doctor and patient lament that the medicinal treatments lack the necessary warmth and dryness, hoping that with prolonged use, the spleen might be warmed and the stomach strengthened, anticipating that one day, results will be achieved. They fail to realize that the stomach is the sea of food and fluids, rich in blood and Qi; when the Qi is clear and harmonious, it can receive; the spleen is the organ of digestion, and when the Qi is clear and harmonious, it can function properly. However, the use of fragrant and warming medicines merely exacerbates the boiling of Qi and blood. Initially, the gastric juices become congealed and unable to receive. Over time, the spleen&#39;s Qi is depleted, leading to delayed transformations. With heat in the stomach causing easy hunger and urgency for food, the spleen is damaged and unexercised, resulting in accumulated pain. Physicians still claim it to be vacuity accompanied by cold. This is not something that ordinary herbs and plants can treat; instead, they recklessly use substances to assist and complement the dry pills, focusing solely on consuming them.

Some inquire: can ancient formulas truly treat those suffering from dryness in the stomach? Are there other prompt methods or can we supplement what previous scholars have missed? I reply: the ancient formulas use ginseng to nourish the lung, rice to detoxify, bamboo juice to clear phlegm, dried ginger to nourish blood, corn to strengthen the stomach, honey water to moisten dryness, and ginger to eliminate impurities; this is precisely the intention. Zhang Jifeng also states: the sensation of obstruction in swallowing must be a disease of the spirit, and only through internal observation and self-nourishment can it be treated. This insight deeply understands the disease condition, and the treatment method aligns well with the principles. The condition of obstruction primarily relates to blood dryness. Blood is yin energy, which signifies stillness. When both the internal and external are still, the fire within the organs does not rise, allowing the dual energies of metal and water to nourish, leading to the spontaneous generation of yin blood. This ensures that the fluids of the intestines and stomach are properly transformed and harmonized—so how could there be any obstruction?<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Food Stasis</strong></p>
<p>Food stasis and esophageal obstruction are caused by phlegm being agitated by qi, and qi being obstructed by phlegm, leading to a blockage where phlegm and qi cannot flow freely. It is recommended to use Erchen Decoction with half a qian of Fructus Aurantii and Grains of Paradise, along with one qian of Saussurea. Alternatively, the Wuge Kuanzhong Powder may be used. This applies to symptoms of fullness and bloating, unjustified chest oppression, upward qi counterflow, or abdominal pain; it is also beneficial to use the Muxiang Liuqi Drink. For various cold pathogens in the chest, regardless of bloating or pain, it is good to administer one or two bowls of ginger juice, especially helpful for phlegm-damp retention. </p>
<p>When evil qi causes obstruction, it is advisable to use dispersing agents. If qi is not flowing smoothly and reverses to cause obstruction, this is classified as a deficiency obstruction. The more one tries to disperse it, the more it develops; thus, it is necessary to balance tonification with a subtle approach to dispersal without excessive use of aromatic agents. According to ancient prescriptions, after purging, for treatment of bloating, the principle of regulating the center applies.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Reverse Stomach</strong></p>
<p>The reason the illness of reverse stomach is more serious than vomiting is that, while vomiting expels food immediately, reverse stomach may last for a day or more, with food returning undigested. The stomach does not lack the desire to eat, but is unwilling to retain food; the stomach&#39;s qi is cold and cannot digest, leading to undigested food not becoming waste and entering the large intestine, which must rise and be expelled from the mouth. Therefore, those with reverse stomach often have their chest and diaphragm oppressed by cold qi. For treatment, one may use Er Chen Decoction, adding ten grains of clove and half a qian of bitter orange peel, or Zhongzhi Decoction with half a qian each of bitter orange peel and sand seed, and one qian of half summer, boiled with rice and fresh ginger. </p>
<p>If the stomach is very cold and the patient vomits after taking medicine, it is advisable to use Aconite and glutinous rice soup with ten grains of clove and half a qian of sand seed; if there is constipation, add another half qian of bitter orange peel. If the oppression in the chest and diaphragm is severe and there is reverse stomach, it is suitable to use Gu Shen Jia He Powder, adding one qian of fresh Aconite, or use Ding Chen Tuo Ge Decoction or Wu Ge Kuan Zhong Powder, also adding one qian of fresh Aconite; furthermore, use Liufu Dan to regulate yin and yang and open the passage. Half-sulfur pill can also promote passage. Long-term blockage of the passage is termed colonic reverse stomach, and the half-sulfur pill is particularly suitable. </p>
<p>If all medicines prove ineffective and the condition is critical, one should use Gui Xiang Qing Jin Powder to induce a resolution. One method involves soaking pepper in vinegar, drying, and soaking it again, without counting the number of times; the more, the better. Grind it into rice powder, mix it with vinegar to form pills, and take ten pills with diluted vinegar soup, increasing to thirty or forty-nine.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan】</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Guange (Closed Position and Blockage)</strong></p>
<p>The classic states: When the Renying pulse is four times greater than the Qikou pulse, it is called &quot;ge&quot; (blockage); when the Qikou pulse is four times greater than the Renying pulse, it is called &quot;guan&quot; (closed position). The &quot;guan&quot; signifies that Yang does not descend, as cold is present in the chest, blocking its entry; &quot;ge&quot; signifies that Yin does not ascend, as heat is present in the lower jiao, blocking its exit. When the upper and lower parts do not communicate, the three jiaos become disordered, middle qi is insufficient, and Yin and Yang cannot nourish each other, hence it is both &quot;guan&quot; and &quot;ge.&quot; </p>
<p>For those with middle vacuity, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; with areca nut to adjust the rise and fall. For those with significant middle vacuity and phlegm accumulation, take &quot;Liujunzi Decoction&quot; minus the atractylodes, adding arborvitae seeds and a small amount of musk. For severe vacuity with vomiting and diarrhea where nothing can be retained, use &quot;Jijiu Pill.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Guange&quot; is slightly different from &quot;ye&quot; (obstruction). When there is a sensation of obstruction in the stomach, desire to ascend but unable, desire to descend but unable, desire to eat but unable, apply &quot;Erchen Decoction&quot; with houttuynia to expel the horizontal obstructive qi; it is not necessary to expel phlegm. </p>
<p>Ancient texts say: &quot;Guange deaths occur from morning to night, but treating the lower jiao can lead to recovery.&quot; The classics state: &quot;When the lesser yang channels are involved, it leads to vomiting, food not being retained, indicating that heat rises and causes vomiting; it is not solely caused by obstruction above, nor is it simply a &#39;ge.&#39; Use &quot;Dachengqi Decoction&quot; to purge it. If one vomits but cannot urinate, use &quot;Weiling Decoction.&quot; For damp-heat accumulation affecting the true water of the north, administer &quot;Zishen Pill.&quot; Avoid using diuretics that are bland and that facilitate water drainage. Any patient with &quot;guange&quot; presenting with head sweating has a fatal prognosis.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　饮食不下而大便不通，名膈噎。疏云：膈有拒格意，即膈食反胃也。《玉机》云：噎塞大便不通，通幽汤。故以膈噎为题。《局方》以噎近咽，膈近胃，而遗下焦，又妄分十膈五噎，皆非经旨。病因内伤忧郁失志，及饮食淫欲，而动脾胃肝肾之火，或因杂病，误服辛香燥药，俱令血液衰耗，胃脘枯槁。其槁在上焦贲门者，食不能下，则胃脘当心而痛，须臾吐出乃止。贲门即胃脘上口，言水谷自此奔入于胃，而气则传之于肺也。其槁在中焦幽门者，食物可下，良久复出。幽门与中脘相近，言其位幽僻，胃中水谷自此而入小肠也。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Esophageal Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When food cannot be ingested and there is constipation, it is called esophageal obstruction. The text states: &quot;Obstruction implies a rejection, that is, food returns to the stomach.&quot; The &quot;Jade Machine&quot; mentions that obstruction leads to constipation; thus, the remedy is &quot;Tongyou Decoction.&quot; Therefore, esophageal obstruction is the subject. The &quot;Jufang&quot; states that obstruction is close to the throat and the diaphragm is close to the stomach, while neglecting the lower burner, misguidedly dividing obstructive issues into ten diaphragm obstructions and five esophageal obstructions, all of which deviate from the principles found in classical texts. The cause of the disease stems from internal injuries due to worries, loss of will, and excessive indulgence in food and desires, which aggravate the fire of the spleen, stomach, liver, and kidneys; or it may arise from miscellaneous illnesses, due to the improper use of spicy and drying medicines, all leading to blood and fluids depleting, and the stomach becoming dry and withered. When this dryness occurs in the upper burner (at the cardia), food cannot descend, causing pain in the stomach, which persists until vomiting occurs to relieve the suffering. The cardia is the upper opening of the stomach, where food and drink rush in, and the qi is transmitted to the lungs. When the dryness is in the middle burner (at the pylorus), food can descend, but after a while, it is expelled. The pylorus is located near the center, indicating its obscure position, where food and drink enter the small intestine.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition in the lower burner, at the threshold, manifests as morning eating and evening vomiting, or evening eating and morning vomiting. The threshold regulates the water and grains beneath the navel, dividing them into the bladder and large intestine to form feces and urine. It is the pathway for the flow of qi, blood, and fluids of the small intestine, large intestine, and bladder. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;The three yangs that are congealed are called the diaphragm.&quot; When there is heat blockage in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; when there is heat blockage in the large intestine, one cannot have a bowel movement; when there is heat blockage in the bladder, the fluids become depleted. With the three yangs blocked by heat, the pulse must be vigorous and rapid, and there will be obstruction both before and after, with blockage below leading to a counter-flow upwards, thus causing food to be stuck and inability to swallow, resulting in regurgitation. This is due to the upward movement of yang fire without descending.</p>
<p>For real fire, use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction with added child&#39;s urine and ginger juice, or form into small pills with Yiyuan Powder mixed with clarified ginger juice, taking them regularly; Wenhui Six Pills are also particularly good. In severe cases, use Tao&#39;s Liuyi Chengqi Decoction or Ren Shen Li Ge Pill.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the body receives cold air, or the mouth is hurt by cold substances, leading to diminished spleen and stomach fire, a feeling of bitterness and cold above the diaphragm, intestinal rumbling, and a pulse that must be slippery and weak; it is appropriate to temporarily use &quot;Clove Boiled Powder,&quot; &quot;Five Diaphragm Decoction,&quot; &quot;Five Choking Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Single Aconite Powder&quot; to alleviate this. If one does not seek the root cause and instead believes it to be merely cold, using pungent and drying medications indiscriminately will inevitably damage the yin without providing relief.</p>
<p>The ancients said: Choking in the diaphragm relates to the spirit, and only inner observation can nurture it. As emotions ignite fire, they evaporate fluids, generating phlegm and accumulation; prolonged accumulation leads to weakening blood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nausea and Dysphagia</strong></p>
<p>Nausea and dysphagia are fundamentally due to the depletion of blood and the dryness of the stomach. When dryness is in the upper part, fluids can pass, but food is difficult to enter, hence it is called dysphagia; when the dryness is in the lower part, food may enter but is later expelled after a long time, hence it is called nausea. Both conditions are generally referred to as &quot;the diaphragm,&quot; which is why the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; only mentions &quot;the diaphragm&quot; as a term for the three yang blockages. According to ancient texts, there are three kinds of vomiting: vomiting from the upper jiao is due to qi, where food leads to violent vomiting; vomiting from the middle jiao is due to accumulation, sometimes preceded by pain or followed by pain after vomiting; vomiting from the lower jiao is due to cold, where morning food is expelled in the evening and evening food in the morning. </p>
<p>Cao&#39;s school divides the symptoms into five types of dysphagia and ten types of diaphragm conditions, which makes the categorization overly complex and confusing. Only Zhang Jifeng suggests that such illness arises from within one&#39;s own contemplation and requires inner observation and quiet nurturing, which deeply resonates with the condition of illness. Generally speaking, the depletion of qi and blood, compounded by sadness, worry, and anger, injures the spleen and stomach, gradually depleting the blood, causing stagnant qi to generate phlegm, which then blocks and obstructs pathways, making it difficult for food and drink to enter—this results in dysphagia. When the spleen and stomach are weakly injured and lose their functions, they are unable to properly digest grains and transform them into essences. Thus, morning food is expelled in the evening and evening food in the morning; although food may enter the stomach, it will return and be rejected—this is how nausea arises. Both conditions occur in the area of the diaphragm, hence the common designation as &quot;the diaphragm.&quot; The vomiting associated with dysphagia corresponds to the upper jiao vomiting in ancient texts; the vomiting associated with nausea corresponds to the lower jiao vomiting. Wang Taibu states: if food cannot enter, it indicates the presence of heat; if food enters and then is expelled, it indicates the absence of heat.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, obstruction and choking predominantly relate to heat, while nausea usually corresponds to cold. However, one should not be overly rigid in this approach. If the pulse is strong and large, one should treat it as heat; if the pulse is weak and small, it should be treated as cold. A yellowish-white complexion that appears withered indicates deficiency and cold; a reddish complexion that is lustrous indicates excess and heat. By correlating the pulse with symptoms and the complexion with the pulse, one can avoid errors. As the classics state: &quot;Those who can unite color and pulse can achieve completeness.&quot; The difficulty in diagnosing this condition arises because if one wishes to strengthen the spleen and regulate phlegm, there are concerns that drying agents may hinder body fluids; if one wishes to nourish blood and generate fluids, there is worry that moistening agents may obstruct the middle. One should carefully assess whether there is injury to yin with excessive fire, in which case nourishing blood should be prioritized; or if there is spleen injury with excess yin, warming and tonifying should come first.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also concerns of distress and blockage, with fire stagnating and unable to disperse. The spirit is not greatly weakened, and the pulse still has strength. One should use the methods of Cang Gong and He Jian to treat it. A small amount of medicinal pills should be used repeatedly, and the blockage will naturally resolve itself. If phlegm in the diaphragm is excessive and subtly surging, one should treat it with downward medication; the efficacy of the medicine will easily take effect. If for some reason it does not work, one can guide the treatment with honey and salt, which will help to naturally open up the channels. All of this is a distinction between the vacuous and the solid, the yin and the yang, and is crucial in the balance during diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Some may become stuck on texts like the &quot;Jinkui&quot; or &quot;Jufang,&quot; overly favoring pungent warming methods, while others may get fixated on the &quot;Yuji&quot; or &quot;Xinfang,&quot; favoring clear and moistening treatments. Such tendencies rely on the appropriateness of the illness and the treatment, rather than adhering strictly to a method of treating the illness.</p>
<p>For any symptoms of reflux that improve with medication, one must not immediately provide congee or rice. Instead, use five qian of ginseng, two qian of dried tangerine peel, and one liang of aged rice to make a soup for delicate sipping. Only after ten days can congee be offered. If the storehouse (the body) has not been sufficiently strengthened, it is inappropriate to introduce grains, as it often leads to ineffective treatment.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Death Certificate</h3>
<p>Those who reach the age of sixty are difficult to treat. However, if they are of robust health, adhere to prohibitions, and trust in medicine, there may be some who survive. Those with stools resembling sheep droppings cannot be treated, and those who foam at the mouth cannot be treated. Those with chest and abdominal pain as if cut by a knife will die.</p>
<h3>Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>A tight and slippery pulse indicates vomiting; a small, weak, and slippery pulse suggests reverse stomach action. A deep, slow, and weak pulse, or a large but weak pulse, indicates Qi deficiency; a rapid and weak pulse, or a thin and weak pulse, indicates blood deficiency. A wiry pulse indicates phlegm, as does a slippery pulse. A tight pulse at the inch and a weak pulse at the cubit indicates fullness in the chest, leading to inability to eat and subsequent vomiting. Furthermore, the &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: when the pulse is leathery, it signifies vomiting.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Food Obstruction</h3>
<p>The terms food obstruction, reversed stomach, and closed gates are distinct, the causes are entirely different, and treatment should be differentiated; one must discern them. Food obstruction occurs when one is hungry and desires food but experiences blockage in the throat and chest area, above the stomach. It has not yet entered the stomach, and mucus and saliva come out. Once it enters the stomach, nothing fails to digest and nothing returns. This condition is primarily found in older men; the young do not experience food obstruction. Reversed stomach occurs when food intake is excessive but ends with the morning meal being vomited in the evening, or the evening meal being vomited in the morning, or vomiting occurring after one or two meals, or after accumulating for a day and night, leading to unbearable bloating in the abdomen and subsequent vomiting of the original substances in an undigested, sour, and foul state. This means that it has entered the stomach and is now being expelled, hence it is called reversed stomach. This condition can occur in men and women of all ages.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition known as &quot;Guan Ge&quot; is described as being unable to eat even a grain of rice; when thirsty, one prefers to drink tea or water, but soon feels the need to expel it. Repeated attempts to drink lead to further expulsion. When taking medicine, hot medicine is immediately rejected, and cold medicine takes a longer time to be expelled. There is also constipation, referred to as Guan Ge. &quot;Guan&quot; means that substances cannot exit the lower part, while &quot;Ge&quot; indicates that substances cannot enter the upper part. This condition is often seen in women.</p>
<p>Regarding the obstruction caused by food in the throat, Danxi claims it arises from the seven emotions and six desires, leading to a transformation of heat rising and a lack of descent. This causes a buildup of phlegm and fluid, providing temporary relief during moments of discomfort, only to resurge soon after. When previous medicines are taken again, they accumulate heat, and blood and fluid become depleted, leading to a dry and withered state in the stomach area. When dryness occurs near the throat, water can pass through, but food is difficult to consume, leading to a condition known as &quot;Yè&quot; or obstruction. If this dryness is located nearer to the stomach, food can enter but is hard to retain, leading to a long delay before it exits the body, referred to as &quot;Ge&quot; or reversed stomach. Bowel movements are infrequent, resembling the consistency of sheep feces.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One must avoid the six excesses externally and regulate the seven emotions internally. By nurturing oneself with appropriate food and drink to nourish the blood and generate fluids, the body will be free from the flames of heat, the kidneys will gradually produce water, and when the qi is clear and the blood is harmonious, the spleen will function well, allowing for the digestion and transformation of food. </p>
<p>Danxi&#39;s discussions are quite clever, but his explanations about choking and reversed stomach conditions lack clarity. I particularly appreciate his idea of the fiery transformation rising up and the kidneys gradually producing water, as it keenly identifies the source of illness. However, I regret that his understanding remains somewhat superficial; he emphasizes nourishing the blood but does not directly explore the original essence within the kidneys. Therefore, his treatment methods involve formulas rich in animal milk, along with substances like bamboo sap and leek juice, which resolve phlegm and stasis but address only the symptoms rather than the root cause.</p>
<p>Does one not understand that the &quot;Neijing&quot; originally does not have much discourse but simply states that the three yang conditions signify a blockage? The three yang refer to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder, and blockage signifies heat accumulation. The large intestine governs fluids, while the small intestine governs liquids. If there is heat accumulation in the large intestine, fluids are depleted; if there is heat accumulation in the small intestine, liquids dry up. The bladder is the governing official of the region, storing fluids. If there is heat accumulation in the bladder, the fluids are exhausted.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, how does the &quot;Three Yangs&quot; lead to heat accumulation? All of it is due to kidney disease. The kidneys govern the five bodily fluids and regulate both urination and defecation; they are considered one organ with the bladder. When kidney water is depleted and yang fire becomes excessive, it boils the fluids, resulting in heat accumulation of the &quot;Three Yangs.&quot; This leads to blockage both anteriorly and posteriorly, causing difficulties in excretion; hence, it must counteract upward, impacting the pathways of clarity, and overflows into the throat, causing difficulty in swallowing food. </p>
<p>Why can water be ingested while food is hard to swallow? Food enters the yin aspect and nourishes the yang, which elevates the fire in the stomach, making it hard to intake; water, being more yin in nature, resonates well and thus can be ingested. When one spits white foam, it is due to the water they consumed boiling and rising. When feces resemble sheep droppings, it indicates that little food has been consumed, and the residue has been fully absorbed, resulting in dry and narrow intestines.</p>
<p>These symptoms are often found in men over the age of fifty who have developed such conditions externally. Moreover, such individuals usually do not curb their desires. If inquiring about the cause, they might shy away from discussing their ailments and instead cite recent emotional distress, experiencing much stagnation as a result.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, the old man&#39;s innocence has long disappeared, leaving only the solitary yang, focusing primarily on nourishing yin. Wang Taifu said: If food is ingested and then vomited, it indicates a lack of water; if food is retained for a long time and then expelled, it indicates a lack of fire. A lack of water hinders the mastery of water, and a lack of fire diminishes the source of fire. Zhu Shizhong stated: To treat an upper ailment, one must use large doses of Liuwei Dihuang pill decocted for drinking; long-term use can recover roughly one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is also necessary to abstain from indulging desires, avoiding certain rooms, and maintaining a bland diet. If one claims to warm the stomach, the stomach is inherently not cold; if one claims to tonify the stomach, the stomach is not deficient; if one claims to alleviate stagnation, aromatic and dry items should not assist fire. The &quot;Jufang Feihua&quot; already has clear explanations, stating that Liu from Hejian uses purgative methods which can damage the stomach with excessive cold, leading to further depletion of fluids.

If the spleen is harmed, digestion does not occur, leading to morning nausea and evening vomiting, or evening meals resulting in morning vomiting, with undigested food, a condition known as vomiting. </p>
<p>I came across a medical case in historical texts stating that a patient with vomiting had undigested food coming up until the next morning. The doctor administered warming gastric medicine, but it was ineffective, and the pulse was very faint and weak. A national expert examined the case and noted that the medicines used were not addressing the patient&#39;s condition effectively, leaving the doctor perplexed. </p>
<p>Reading Dong Yuan’s writings, it is stated that vomiting has three causes: accumulation of qi, cold, and cold in the lower region. Upper jiao vomiting is due to qi, middle jiao vomiting is due to accumulation, and lower jiao is due to cold. In this case, the pulse is deep and slow, with morning nausea and evening vomiting, and small bowel movements but constipation. This indicates lower jiao vomiting. The treatment should focus on relieving the blockage and warming the cold. Therefore, we specifically treat the lower jiao, dispelling the cold, and gradually harmonizing with middle jiao remedies to promote recovery. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the pulse at the Renying and the Cun position is strong, if it exceeds four times, it indicates a blockage. A weakened pulse at the blockage cannot reach the essence of the universe and will lead to death. This is related to the three Yang organs and the three Yin organs, which are diagnosed at the positions next to the throat&#39;s Renying, and at the positions of the hands&#39; Cun and Taiyuan. The needling methods are applied according to the flow of the Renying and Cun meridians. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that acupuncture should address the excess Yang by draining it and supplementing the corresponding Yin, employing two drainages and one supplementation. Similarly, for the Cun, excess Yin is drained while supplementing the corresponding Yang, also using two drainages and one supplementation, all of which should cease when the Qi is harmonized. Regarding herbal treatment, it is important to assess the pulses at the wrists&#39; Cun, Guan, and Chi positions to differentiate the Yin and Yang of the organs. Therefore, the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; further states that when pathology is in the organs, the Yang pulse is out of harmony; when the Yang pulse is out of harmony, Qi stagnates, and when Qi stagnates, Yang Qi becomes excessive. If Yang Qi becomes too abundant, the Yin pulse will be out of harmony; when the Yin pulse is out of harmony, blood stagnates, and when blood stagnates, Yin Qi becomes excessive.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the yin qi is too abundant, the yang qi cannot thrive; thus it is called a &quot;barrier.&quot; When the yang qi is too abundant, the yin qi cannot thrive; thus it is called a &quot;block.&quot; When both yin and yang are abundant, they cannot nurture each other; hence it is referred to as a &quot;barrier-block.&quot; A barrier-block cannot allow one to die at a predetermined time. This is the balance used in medicine, determining treatment according to the pulse&#39;s measurements of excessive yin and yang. The people of Yue regard this as significant, expressing it as a pulse where yin dominates over yang. They interpret excess yang as being like overflow and entry as coverage, depicting the phenomenon of yin and yang being skewed and unable to revert accurately. Later, Zhongjing established three major principles: he stated that a floating and large pulse at the cun position indicates emptiness, while the size indicates solidity; at the chi position, it is a barrier, and at the cun, it is a block. If there is a barrier, one cannot urinate easily, and with a block, there may be vomiting. By examining both hands at the cun position, determining the balance between excessive yin and yang, and observing whether they are floating or large, one can ascertain if there is deficiency in yang or excess in yin, or vice versa, to apply treatment.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it is stated that when Yang is excessively strong, Yin cannot thrive; when Yin is excessively strong, Yang cannot thrive. Furthermore, the methods of the Yue people concerning Yin and Yang, coupled with the distinctions of vacuity and substance, lead to a clear understanding of reality. Without this, the conditions will be firmly categorized as Yin or Yang. But from whence can one discern the subtle nuances? This is one principle: when the heart pulse is ample and long, it indicates the essence of the heart’s pulse. If the upper pulse is slight and the head small, sweating occurs; if the lower pulse is large, then obstruction results, and urination cannot take place. If there is no sweating in the head, treatment is possible; if sweating occurs, death follows. This clearly illustrates the source of the obstruction, which stems from the fire of the five emotions being trapped within the heart&#39;s membrane. The upper pulse appearing slight with a small head indicates Yang deficiency, while the lower pulse appearing large indicates Yang excess. If there is no sweating in the head, treatment is feasible; if there is sweating, the heart’s essence is lost, leading to self-immolation. In cases of the two Yang conditions affecting the heart and spleen, there can be no hidden curves; men may have diminished essence, and women may be without their monthly cycle, resulting in transmitted conditions that vanish without remedy.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

This affects the heart and spirit, all contained within a tiny space, where the chances of life and death are exceedingly close—how can one not carefully discern it? These are the two methods. It refers to the presence or absence of the &quot;fu yang&quot; pulse; when it is suppressed, it leads to regurgitation, and food and drink cannot be digested. When it is weak, no food can even enter, which is called &quot;guan ge.&quot; By diagnosing the &quot;fu yang&quot; pulse at the foot, one can determine whether it is suppressed or weak, which reveals the state of the stomach&#39;s qi. If suppressed, it indicates that food and drink enter but do not digest; if weak, it shows that no food can enter, revealing the state of the stomach&#39;s qi even further.

This is akin to navigating the seas for thousands of miles, finding a companion with whom to share a harmonious voice, bringing unmatchable joy, yet one cannot consider it a shortcoming. However, one does not wish future generations to settle comfortably into these views, nor can one bear to remain silent. It is said that when yin and yang shift places, the condition is termed as &quot;blockage.&quot; If yang energy is consistently present in the chest, it leads to heat as the primary illness; if yin energy is consistently present below the waist, it leads to cold as the primary illness. If there is cold in the chest, one should treat it with heat; if there is heat in the lower dantian, one should treat it with cold. If there is a combination of cold and heat in the chest, treatment should be based on the primary and secondary principles. The treatment for the primary condition should be gentle, while treatment for the secondary condition should be urgent. This stems from the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; where cold is present in the chest and heat in the lower dantian, asserting the viewpoint that is indeed not necessarily linked to blockage as a fundamental condition.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Prescription of Huanglian Decoction for Ingress and Egress</strong></p>
<p>Huanglian Decoction is a formula from Zhongjing for treating typhoid fever. When there is heat in the chest,邪气 in the stomach, and pain in the abdomen with a desire to vomit, Huanglian Decoction is the primary remedy. The邪气 in the stomach obstructs the mechanism of ascent and descent of yin and yang, preventing them from interacting with the middle earth. Thus, yin cannot rise and becomes trapped below, causing cold pain in the lower abdomen; yang cannot descend and remains solely in the upper body, leading to heat in the chest and a desire to vomit. </p>
<p>This decoction indeed facilitates the proper ascent and descent of yin and yang. However, for those with dampness, a tongue that resembles a fetus, heat in the dantian, and cold in the chest, can this formula still be used? Later generations have forced interpretations that fail to capture the essence of the formula, yet how can they modify the prescription? Typhoid fever is typically divided into three treatments: exterior, interior, and central. When both exterior and interior邪气 are strong, one should harmonize from the center, which is why there is the harmonizing method of Xiao Chaihu Decoction, combining Ren Shen, Gan Cao, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao to support the stomach, while adding one ingredient of Chaihu to facilitate the exterior and one ingredient of Huangqin to penetrate the interior.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is still a fear that the essence may be insufficiently exposed, which can be detrimental to harmony. Thus, after removing the dregs, it is repeatedly boiled without distinction, and when consumed, it enters the stomach. The ascending stomach qi carries Chai Hu to the exterior, while the descending stomach qi brings Huang Qin inward. When they harmonize, the evils from both interior and exterior are dispelled; if any remain, they should be treated accordingly, without any conflict.</p>
<p>As for the evils within the lower dantian and the chest, they are situated above and below and are not considered exterior or interior. Therefore, one should transform Chai Hu Decoction into Huang Lian Decoction to harmonize these areas. Replace Chai Hu with Gui Zhi, Huang Qin with Huang Lian, and fresh ginger with dried ginger. When consumed, it is also important to monitor the upward and downward movements of the stomach qi, allowing for treatment regardless of whether the upper part is hot and the lower part is cold, or vice versa.</p>
<p>For exterior and interior evils, Chai Hu and Huang Qin should be used; for upper and lower evils, Gui Zhi and Huang Lian are applied. To dispel exterior evils, fresh ginger&#39;s pungency is used; for upper and lower evils, the spiciness of dried ginger is employed. The methods of Zhang Zhongjing are indeed profound. If one wishes to engage in the methods of promoting or retreating the upper and lower, what technique should one use? In previous discussions, these were sought through the middle, grasping the pivot and moving it, gradually penetrating from above and below, waiting for the ying qi to be fully communicated and the wei qi to be fully obtained for advancement or retreat. However, this aspect is difficult to articulate. If there is obstruction, there might be regurgitation; thus, using this method is appropriate. After all, the sun (Tai Yang) governs opening; if the sun does not open, there will be obstruction in the chest, preventing food from being ingested, which would either be refused entry or expelled again. Therefore, using Gui Zhi as the medicinal agent of the Tai Yang channel harmonizes ying and wei qi and facilitates the Yang pathway, thus enabling the opening.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the five emotions and the yang fire rising, the use of cinnamon twig (gui zhi) is no longer appropriate; if used, it will lead to fire assisting fire, causing sweating from the head and the escape of yang, thus preventing urination. The method of retreating relies on the stomach qi penetrating into the yin segment, hence cinnamon twig should not be utilized. However, if the stomach&#39;s gate is already closed, the lesser yin governs closure, and the qi of the lesser yin does not rise, the stomach’s gate cannot open. Chang Yi stated that the pulse of the lesser yin is deep and stagnant, while that of the foot yang is prone and slack—both are causes for concern. The Nei Jing often reiterates this: when the kidney qi is solely deep, it is said to be unbalanced. The true qi in the kidney is akin to a balance scale; if there is both weight and balance, the gate opens and closes at intervals; if there is weight but no balance, the gate is closed and cannot open. How then can the small urine be released? Thus, the kidney qi pill embodies all matters of retreating. When the kidney qi connects with the stomach, the gate opens; when it connects with the heart, the yang fire proceeds to descend, making it sometimes unavoidable to use. Advance and retreat must follow this order; is this something an average person can discern?<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Guan Ge</strong></p>
<p>The condition of &quot;guan ge&quot; is illustrated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which discusses the pulse patterns to reveal the dangers of the separation of Yin and Yang. This is evident from discussions found in various sections such as the &quot;Six Seasonal Organs,&quot; &quot;Beginning and End,&quot; &quot;Prohibitions on Medicines,&quot; and discussions regarding pulse measurements and meridians. Since these insights are so significant, we can understand their weight.</p>
<p>Originating from the writings of the Qin dynasty&#39;s Yue people, there are three difficulties mentioned: &quot;Upper fish&quot; indicates overflow, signifying the external blockage in &quot;guan&quot;; &quot;Inner measurement&quot; indicates overturning, signifying the internal blockage in &quot;ge.&quot; Discussing &quot;guan ge&quot; in these terms has strayed from their original meaning in the canon.</p>
<p>Moreover, Zhongjing states: at the pulse point of the &quot;chi&quot; (尺) is &quot;guan,&quot; while at the pulse point of the &quot;cun&quot; (寸) is &quot;ge.&quot; If &quot;guan&quot; is affected, urination is impaired; if &quot;ge,&quot; then there is vomiting and regurgitation. Thus, from the time of Shuhe and Dongyuan onwards, this understanding has been tradition, and eventually, the notion of &quot;guan ge&quot; has been lost entirely.</p>
<p>Later, Danxi mentioned: this condition often leads to death. Cold is located above and heat below, with the pulse in both &quot;cun&quot; points being four times stronger than normal; the treatment should involve emesis to elevate the horizontal stagnation of Qi without needing to expel phlegm.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I foolishly argue that if both the cun and the two-inch pulse are four times strong, how can we then say that it indicates cold in excess? Moreover, if the pulse is large like this, it is floating and has no root, its emptiness is evident; how can it be expelled? This is erroneous and indeed the worst error! The Inner Classic states that the renying pulse can be four times strong, and the cunkou pulse can also be four times; these are not to be taken literally about their size, but rather indicate an expulsion of food stagnation; to say one cannot urinate indicates urinary retention. Each of these two conditions has its own criteria, and how does it relate to the diagnosis of guangu? This is true for you students—why should it be different in other cases? How can we then expect those who treat such conditions to be free from error?</p>
<p>The guangu diagnosis in the Inner Classic is originally examined through the renying pulse for the yang of the six fu organs, and the cunkou pulse examines the yin of the five zang organs. When the renying pulse is exceedingly strong, exceeding four times, this indicates the solitary yang of the yangming channel; the water does not assist the fire, hence it is termed gu阳. Gu阳 refers to the yin being constrained by the yang. When the cunkou pulse is exceedingly strong, exceeding four times, this indicates that the ta阴 channel has no main yin, and the qi does not return to the essence, hence it is termed gu阴. Gu阴 refers to the yang intervening with the yin. If both the renying and cunkou pulses are strong to the level of four times or more, both large and numerous, this indicates that the yang qi does not accumulate, thus there is no yang within the yin, and the yin qi does not rise, hence there is no yin within the yang; yin and yang are separated, hence it is named guangu.</p>
<p>All those who observe this condition are generally affected by excessive drinking and indulgence, and emotional desires harm the essence; thus, the yang cannot maintain its residence, leading to a floating pulse that is exposed and excessively strong. This signifies the true yin being depleted and the yuan sea having no root, which genuinely reflects the image of a dragon soaring high with regrets, indicating the utmost danger in prognosis.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

The inch pulse is the major representation of the pulse, and when the pulse is discerned there, it will also appear in the other; hence, by observing the inch, the pulse of the renying can also be generally seen. Therefore, whenever the inch pulse is extremely large, even four times its expected size, and both large and numerous, it indicates a pulse of guan ge, which should not be mistaken for a fire condition. I have diagnosed several individuals with this pulse, and upon observation, it felt like a string or leather, abnormally large—hence I say four times. Observing its symptoms, the pulse movement corresponds with body movement, particularly noticeable in the voids beneath the breasts and in the motions around the navel; all appear active and resonant, responding with the pulse. In examining its form and energy, there is slight wheezing above, and upon movement, the wheezing intensifies. The limbs lack strength, and there are frequent states of anxiety during wakefulness and sleep, leading one to deem it a deficiency without cough or blood loss symptoms, or if judged to be phlegm-fire, it lacks signs of a true pathogenic heat. This is what differentiates guan ge.

<p>The &quot;Classic on Pulse Diagnosis&quot; states: When yin qi is too abundant, yang qi cannot flourish, hence it is called &#39;Guan&#39; (Barrier); when yang qi is too abundant, yin qi cannot flourish, hence it is called &#39;Ge&#39; (Obstruction).

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Inspissation and Phlegm Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>In the case of inspissation, it is definitely formed due to excessive sorrow, worry, accumulated labor, pent-up emotions, or harm from excessive indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures. Excessive worry and thought lead to qi stagnation; when qi is stagnant, transformation doesn’t occur. Excessive indulgence injures the yin, and if the yin is harmed, essence and blood dry up. If qi stagnates, there arises an upper syndrome of inspissation; if essence and blood dry up, there arises a lower syndrome of dryness and stagnation. Furthermore, all human visceral qi involves the reception by the stomach, the transformation by the spleen, and the kidneys serving as the foundation of water and fire, the origin of transformation. Now, if food and drink are obstructed and not functioning, or if stool is dry and cannot be passed, is this not a failure of transformation and a disorder of blood circulation? The authority governing the circulation of blood in the upper body lies with the spleen; in the lower body, it lies with the kidneys. Moreover, this syndrome is rarely seen in the young, but is more common in those who are middle-aged and weakened. This shows the distinction between the real and the illusory. Thus, in treating this condition, one must not abandon the fundamental roots in pursuit of quick paths, as success cannot be expected! Regarding the conditions of inspissation and reverse stomach (regurgitation), Dan Xi states that although they are named differently, the illnesses arise from the same source, which certainly shows their similarity.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, there is indeed a difference. In cases of reversed stomach, the food can still enter the body but then comes back out, hence called &quot;reversed stomach&quot;; in cases of blocked throat, there is an obstruction preventing food from going down, hence called &quot;blocked throat.&quot; When food enters and then comes back out, it is due to yang deficiency that cannot transform; this can be supplemented and warmed, making treatment relatively easy. When food cannot go down, it is due to qi stagnation that cannot move; treatment may either require unblocking or assisting, thus making the process more difficult. This reflects the differences in severity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those suffering from reversed stomach often can still eat, while those with blocked throat cannot eat. The illness of blocked throat is located in the chest and upper jiao, while the illness of reversed stomach is located in the middle and lower jiao. This is a distinction in the symptoms. Therefore, the treatment for reversed stomach often needs to boost the source of fire to assist in transformation, while the treatment for blocked throat often needs to nourish the heart and spleen to alleviate the stagnation of qi. Since the symptoms are different, diagnosis and treatment should also be categorized accordingly.</p>
<p>The condition of blocked throat often accompanies constipation. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;The three yang that are bound together is called the throat.&quot; Zhang Zihe states: &quot;The three yang refers to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder.&quot; The binding refers to heat binding.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a heat block in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; when there is a heat block in the large intestine, there is constipation; when there is a heat block in the bladder, the fluids are depleted. When the three yangs are blocked, there is obstruction both before and after. If the lower part is not open, it must flow upward, which causes difficulty in swallowing food; even if it goes down, it comes back up. This is due to the yang fire pushing upwards instead of descending. In my humble opinion, this interpretation is quite incorrect. The meaning of &quot;block&quot; in the context of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not primarily refer to heat, as this text states: &quot;When yin and yang are blocked, there is more yin and less yang, which is called stone water.&quot; Furthermore, it is mentioned in the discussion of pain: &quot;Thinking causes the qi to become blocked.&quot; Is it thus correct to equate blockage with heat? Moreover, heat facilitates flow, while cold causes condensation; this is a fundamental principle of yin and yang. Indeed, frost condenses into ice only in extreme cold, and heat does not do so. This is an evident truth of the natural order. The principles of yin and yang in the human body are no different; only humans cannot fully comprehend them, leading to many misunderstandings. Furthermore, when the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; refers to the blockage of the three yangs, it speaks only of the small intestine and bladder, with no relation to the large intestine. The three yangs refer to the sun, with the hand representing the small intestine and the foot representing the bladder.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The small intestine belongs to fire and the bladder to water. If fire does not transform, yang energy does not circulate and its transmission fails; if water does not transform, yin energy does not circulate, and the distinction between clarity and turbidity becomes muddled. This is the root cause of obstruction. Zihé did not discern this and ultimately attributed the obstruction of the three yang channels entirely to heat, leading future generations to universally interpret it as fire—how misguided is that! </p>
<p>However, diseases associated with obstructions do not stem from a single source; in fact, both qi and blood can become obstructed, and both yang and yin can lead to their own types of obstructions. I do not mean to say that all obstructions are cold and devoid of heat; rather, yin obstructions and yang obstructions manifest differently, and this distinction must not be overlooked. Yang obstruction is indeed a heat obstruction, arising from fire&#39;s excessive disturbance of yin, causing it to congeal. This only occurs with exterior pathogens invading the interior or with true heat in the yangming channel.</p>
<p>Moreover, heat obstructions must be accompanied by symptoms such as thirst, fever, and other signs, which are easily identifiable, clearly reflected in the pulse being forceful, large, slippery, and solid. If there is obstruction below but no signs of heat above, this indicates a yin obstruction—how can one claim it to be heat? The essence of yin obstruction lies in the lack of fire in the life gate, leading to inadequate transformation of essence and resulting in congealment below, with the flow of treatment stagnated. This is exclusively due to internal injuries to the blood and qi, affecting true yin, as is the case with the symptoms of food stagnation. The symptoms of food stagnation are widely recognized as stemming from internal injuries.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At this point of internal injury, how can one assess the health of the internal organs and the vital energies, while still claiming it to be heat? Is it truly necessary for the original yang to be completely depleted before there can be another path to life? Alas! This is something I cannot comprehend, and I must clarify!</p>
<p>The condition of food obstruction has often been considered by ancient scholars to be due to cold. Since Liu Hejian treated food obstruction with the Three Chengqi Decoction, Zhang Zihe has discussed the complete binding of the three yangs as being due to heat, also stating that a person&#39;s overeating does not happen suddenly: it may either injure due to food or drink, or due to heat in the stomach causing a desire to vomit. If physicians do not understand the root cause and instead prescribe aromatic herbs, cassia, pepper, and cloves, how can they assert weakness and then supplement with heat?</p>
<p>For those with inherent heat, the three yangs will certainly bind, and food will easily ascend. Yet physicians still argue that the stomach is cold and cannot accept food, cauterizing with needles and moxibustion; as the three yangs become increasingly bound over time, they eventually lead to food obstruction. I find this reasoning puzzling. </p>
<p>Food obstruction arises from dryness and is not fundamentally a sign of true heat. Is the Three Chengqi Decoction still applicable? Liu Hejian&#39;s view appears inaccurate. Moreover, an excess of meat and wine does not necessarily lead to food obstruction; is it the case that all who suffer from food obstruction are people with inherent heat? Zhang Zihe&#39;s perspective also seems to have its flaws.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From then on, Danxi followed the teachings of the two Sons and critically evaluated the errors in &quot;Jufang.&quot; He stated that the initial sickness of qi may arise from various sources: either from careless eating and drinking, or exposure to wind and rain, or internal emotional disturbances, or from overly rich food that excessively nourishes yang qi, leading to the accumulation of heat in the diaphragm. It may also come from a full constitution without sweating, or a naturally irritable temper causing liver fire to rise, resulting in stagnation of bodily fluids, which makes qi unwell. This could manifest as distension, pain, foul belching, sour regurgitation, or a sense of fullness. Without seeking the root cause, one hastily identifies it as cold and hastily administers spicy, aromatic, and drying heat remedies, experiencing temporary relief that mistakenly seems like a miraculous cure. Continuing rich flavors and failing to regulate emotions lead to a recurrence, with old issues being aggravated, momentarily relieving stagnant fluids but making them easier to accumulate again. In half a month or a month, previous ailments re-emerge. Physicians, not understanding the situation, insist it is due to cold, and revert to previous remedies for quick results, hoping for lasting effects through prolonged use to warm the spleen, strengthen the stomach, and promote the movement of stagnation, with the hope that one day there will be a clear resolution. However, they forget that the stomach is the sea of grains and can only receive when it is clear and harmonious, and the spleen is the organ of digestion that can only function properly when it is also clear and harmonious. Now, instead of gaining assistance from the offset of fragrant warming, they allow their condition to worsen, causing long-term complications. This is indeed lamentable. This is Danxi&#39;s teaching, which, when seen by later generations, is universally regarded as the utmost principle. Even in my early years, I could not help but admire it, yet now I increasingly see its errors.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is it? If we examine the causes of the illness described, some may indeed be true while others may not, but it is difficult to clearly differentiate them. If we rely solely on this evidence and insist on classifying it as heat, can we be free from error? Moreover, since it is stated that dry heat medicines can promptly bring relief, it surely possesses some efficacy. If dry heat can be effective, can it truly be said that only genuine heat can be effective? The spleen is antagonistic to dampness, hence dryness can be effective. Fire can nurture earth, thus heat can be effective as well. Warming dryness supports yang; this is the proper treatment of the spleen family, and to insist otherwise, leading to doubts among later generations, seems excessive. If it is said that indulging in rich flavors and emotions without moderation leads to recurrence, whose fault is this? Can it also be attributed to a mistake in medicine? Furthermore, concerning the claim that a balanced spleen and stomach can receive and transform, this is indeed a sound principle, who would dispute it? However, my understanding of balance differs from that of Danxi. But why is that? Danxi expresses concern about excessive fire; I express concern about diminishing yang. With such differences, who will believe? Please consider the principles governing heaven and humanity; how about that? What both heaven and humanity rely upon is solely this yang qi. Thus, the text states: Clear and tranquil weather is illuminating. It also says: Yang qi is like heaven and sun; if it loses its position, it withers and does not manifest, thus heavenly operations should shine with sunlight.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From this, it can be said that the universe thrives in harmony, with the sun playing a significant role. When the yang energy prevails, it brings warmth and light, allowing all things to flourish; is this not harmony? When the yin energy prevails, it causes wind and haze, resulting in stagnation; is this not a departure from harmony? Moreover, the flourishing of all things in spring and summer arises from the vigor of yang; while the decline of all things in autumn and winter is a sign of waning yang. What sustains human life is nothing but this. </p>
<p>Thus, when food enters in the morning, it is digested by noon; when it enters the stomach by noon, it is digested by evening. The heat within, similar to that of a boiling cauldron, must align with harmony. This is the normal state of a person and is precisely what we call the stomach&#39;s energy. If one eats in the morning and is not hungry by noon, eats at noon and is not hungry by evening, and if digestion is slow, this is an indication of diminished yang energy. </p>
<p>Moreover, if one finds oneself completely unable to function or digest, doctors would still assert there is fire; must this source of transformation be entirely extinguished before one can be well again?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the treatment of phlegm obstruction, the spleen and kidneys should be the main focus. The spleen governs transformation and transportation, and its extensive networks spread throughout the chest region; the kidneys govern fluids, with their energy regulating the lower yin. Therefore, the obstruction in the upper jiao is attributed to the spleen, while the blockage in the lower jiao is attributed to the kidneys. To treat the spleen, one should proceed from warming nourishment, while to treat the kidneys, one should focus on moistening. Beyond these two methods, there are no shortcuts. However, the principle of balance indicates that the heavens and earth are interconnected, and thus, the three yang must emerge from the ground before all things thrive, illustrating that the mother of spleen earth rises from below.</p>
<p>Chancellor Chu said: &quot;To treat external diseases, address internal issues; to treat upper ailments, support the lower.&quot; One must discern the deficiency or excess of the organs and understand the dynamic between parent and child organs in disease. This wisdom is valuable and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>For treating phlegm obstruction, when both qi and blood are deficient, one should use the Five Blessings Decoction or the Ten Complete Great Nourishing Soup. If there is spleen deficiency in the upper body, one should use the Four Gentlemen Decoction; if there is spleen deficiency with cold, the Five Gentlemen Decoction is indicated. If there is deficiency in the spleen and lung with dry blood, one should use ginger juice decoction; for lower yin deficiency, one should use the Left Return Decoction or the Great Nourishing Decoction. If there is yin deficiency with yang deficiency, one should use the Right Return Decoction with angelica, or formulas like the Right Return Pill or the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Using warming and tonifying methods to treat obstruction of the throat, one might suspect stagnation and find it too slow, not realizing the collapse of central qi. This is most concerning: if the root cause isn&#39;t swiftly remedied, how can the spleen&#39;s qi be restored? If warming and tonifying methods cause greater obstruction, one must reluctantly adjust the treatment. Yet, it is crucial to carefully select from the foundational qi to ensure safety. </p>
<p>Even if after using tonics no immediate effect is seen, as long as there is no blockage, it indicates a fitting combination of medicine and ailment. This condition is particularly difficult to treat. If the patient can tolerate tonics, they must take them in substantial amounts to gradually see results and achieve full recovery. One shouldn&#39;t be impatient and suspicious, causing self-doubt and fluctuation in treatment effectiveness.</p>
<p>If urgent remedies are sought for immediate relief, employing drastic measures such as Da Huang (rhubarb), Mang Xiao (bitter salt), San Leng (sparganii rhizome), E Zhu (curcuma), Yu Jin (curcuma), Tao Ren (peach kernel), or rolling phlegm pills will not yield results; they will only damage gastric qi, leading to inevitable deterioration. This is hastening towards demise and must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>In treating throat obstruction, traditional practices rely on ginseng and astragalus to tonify the original qi, while using rice and millet to detoxify and strengthen the stomach, bamboo juice to clear phlegm and disperse masses, dried ginger to warm the center, fresh ginger to eliminate impurities, cow and sheep milk to nourish blood and moisten fluids, as well as honey and angelica to relieve dryness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Argument of Reflux</p>
<p>The phenomenon of reflux is fundamentally due to a deficiency of fire. When food enters the stomach, it warms the spleen and strengthens it, leading to complete digestion; how could it then be rejected? Various schools of thought suggest it is due to phlegm or excess heat. They do not realize that the retention of phlegm and fluid stems from a weakness in the stomach, causing undigested food to be expelled — how could it be considered properly digested? Wang Taibu said, &quot;If there is obstruction in the stomach causing nausea and food cannot be taken in, this indicates the presence of fire; but if food comes back up after being ingested, this indicates a lack of fire.&quot; This statement is indeed comprehensive. However, even without fire, it is essential to discern between the upper, middle, and lower jiaos, as different conditions apply. </p>
<p>If cold is present in the upper jiao, it often results in nausea or a general feeling of wanting to vomit; this indicates a deficiency of yang in the stomach. If cold is in the middle jiao, then the food does not digest, and may be expelled shortly after, indicating a deficiency of yang within the stomach. If cold is in the lower jiao, it can lead to morning vomiting of food eaten the previous evening, or evening vomiting of food eaten in the morning; this occurs because food enters the pylorus but cannot be transformed by the fire, resulting in expulsion due to prolonged retention, indicative of a deficiency of yang at the life gate (ming men). Thus, for any treatment of this condition, if one does not understand where the root of the problem lies, they may blindly guess and aim for results without understanding the underlying pathology, making it exceedingly difficult.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat the condition of reverse stomach (nausea), it is essential to distinguish between its recent and long-standing causes. It may stem from excessive drinking leading to dampness from alcohol, or from overeating cold foods that deplete the true yang.

Therefore, any treatment for this should focus on supporting the righteous energy, strengthening the spleen, and nourishing the stomach. </p>

If one merely seeks immediate results without addressing the root cause, there may be temporary relief, but the true yin will become further depleted. Therefore, in treating this condition, if one observes deficiency of yin along with cold, the main approach should be to tonify the yang, significantly incorporating ingredients like angelica, cistanche, leek juice, and ginger juice. If there is deficiency of yin accompanied by heat, the main approach should be to nourish the yin, adding substances like milk, children&#39;s urine, ghee, honey, pig fat, and various types of blood. However, these treatments are particularly difficult to yield results, and one must not desire quick fixes. Without a period of careful adjustment, usually spanning several weeks or months, recovery cannot be achieved! Conditions presenting with feces resembling sheep droppings, or those who are older and suffer from this ailment, are especially challenging to treat. For instances of reversed stomach due to alcohol dampening the spleen, the main prescription should be Ge Hua Jie Cheng Decoction. If there is excess dampness leading to heat, with symptoms of stomach fire surging upwards, Huang Qin Decoction or Ban Xia Xie Xin Decoction should be administered.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　噎膈反胃治法</p>
<p>　　反胃证初起之时，未尝非胃病也，当时以逍遥散加黄连一钱立止。无如世医不知治法，乃用香砂、厚朴、枳壳、砂仁之类，纷投之不应；又改用大黄、巴豆之类下之，又不应；改用黄连、黄蘗、黄芩、栀子、知母大寒之品以凉之，又不应；改用桂枝、白果、肉桂、附子、干姜、吴茱萸之类以热之，又不应；始用柴胡、荆芥、桔梗、防风、苏子之类以散之，遂成噎膈之证矣。吾今传一方，用熟地一两，山茱萸四钱，麦冬三钱，北五味、元参、当归、白芥子各一钱，牛膝二钱，水煎服。此方之妙，全在不治反胃，正所以治反胃也。盖人反胃，乃是肾中阴水竭也，肾水不足则大肠细小，水不足以润之，故肠细而干涸。肠既细小，则饮食入胃，不能下行，必反而上吐。治之之法，不可治上，宜治下。<a id="orig-91p" href="#trans-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method for Reflux and Nausea</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of reflux symptoms, it is not necessarily a stomach issue. At this point, taking Xiao Yao San with ten grams of Huai Lian can stop it. However, many doctors do not understand the treatment method and instead use ingredients like Xiang Sha, Hou Po, Zhi Ke, and Sha Ren, which do not work; they then switch to using Da Huang and Ba Dou, which also fail. Next, they try cooling herbs like Huang Lian, Huang Bo, Huang Qin, Zhi Zi, and Zhi Mu, but this too is ineffective. They try warming herbs such as Gui Zhi, Bai Guo, Rou Gui, Fu Zi, Gan Jiang, and Wu Zhu Yu, yet there is still no response. Finally, they use dispersing herbs like Chai Hu, Jing Jie, Jie Geng, Fang Feng, and Su Zi, resulting in the condition of reflux.</p>
<p>Now, I pass on a formula: one ounce of Shu Di, four coins of Shan Zhu Yu, three coins of Mai Dong, one coin each of Bei Wu Wei, Yuan Shen, Dang Gui, and Bai Jie Zi, and two coins of Niu Xi, boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in not treating the reflux directly, which is precisely how to treat it. The reason for reflux is the depletion of Yin water in the kidneys. When kidney water is insufficient, the large and small intestines cannot be sufficiently moistened, leading to dryness. With dry intestines, food entering the stomach cannot descend and must instead be vomited back up. Therefore, the method of treatment should not focus on the upper part but rather on the lower.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The formula employs prepared rehmannia and shan zhu yu, which are purely for replenishing the water in the kidneys. When kidney water is sufficient, the large intestine is also nourished with water, allowing it to expand and properly accommodate substances. When the pathway for water is wide, boats of all sizes can navigate freely; hence, there is no fear that a small boat cannot transport grain. This treatment is appropriate for a deficiency of water in the kidneys that fails to moisten the large intestine. However, if the kidneys are cold and deficient, this method is not suitable. Although the name &quot;reversal of stomach&quot; may be the same, the actual condition differs. Reversal due to a lack of water in the kidneys causes immediate vomiting upon swallowing food, while reversal from a lack of fire in the kidneys results in delayed vomiting, where food is retained until the next day before being expelled. For example, food eaten today may only be vomited out the next day. </p>
<p>The formula includes one tael of prepared rehmannia, four qian of shan zhu yu, three qian of mai dong, two qian each of shan yao and fu ling, one qian each of northern wuweizi, dan pi, ze xie, niu xi, fu zi, and rou gui, and is decocted in water for consumption. This is the eight-ingredient pill soup. The key lies in using fu zi and rou gui to nourish kidney water while also addressing the fire within the water. Nourishing the fire helps to rejuvenate the life-gate fire. The qi of the spleen and stomach must rely on the life-gate fire to be generated; like a pot without fire, how can it cook? Without it, the water is cold and metal is chilled, leading to frost. One must first restore the initial warmth of yang to resolve this.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The human body’s spleen and stomach function similarly; however, in the case of illnesses caused by cold and chill, one usually experiences abdominal pain and distress. Yet, if there are no such symptoms now, what could be the reason for the upward sensation accompanied by vomiting? It is because when the spleen and stomach have a passage, the cold pathogenic energy does not remain within. Now, with the upward forces releasing through the mouth and throat, the gastric entrance has become a broad avenue, allowing for free passage without obstruction. Thus, the energy easily flows, and there is no need for it to accumulate within the central region, lurking in the heart and abdomen, causing cold to generate heat that brings suffering to the spleen and stomach. This, in fact, is what allows for the absence of pain in the heart and abdomen. This is not merely about treating the symptoms of vomiting but rather addressing the root cause of it; this marks the beginning of transformative methods for treating diseases.</p>
<p>When food enters and quickly exits, it is due to the deficiency of kidney water, which fails to moisten the throat, leading to dryness and an immediate expulsion. When food lingers and then is expelled, it is due to the deficiency of kidney fire, which cannot warm the spleen, resulting in cold in the spleen and subsequent expulsion. To treat the symptoms of vomiting, it is essential to address the kidneys and to differentiate whether there is fire or no fire; doing so can transform potentially fatal symptoms into life-sustaining outcomes. The ideal remedy for the symptoms of vomiting is to use Zhang Jing’s Rehmannia Decoction. If there is no fire, one should add Aconite and Cinnamon, which will yield beneficial results just as before. However, some people may use Zhang Jing’s prescriptions without achieving results. Why is this? It is due to improperly applying the method, rather than any deficiency in the formulas themselves. Now, regarding the two prescriptions: one for treating vomiting without fire includes one ounce of cooked Rehmannia, one ounce of Sichuan Cornelian cherry, and three qian each of Aconite, Poria, Water Plantain, Moutan Peony, and Cinnamon, along with one qian of Chinese Yam, to be decocted and consumed.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For treating fire and regurgitation, use: 2 taels of cooked rehmannia, 1 tael of yam, 3 qian each of alisma and processed moutan root, 5 qian each of poria, ophiopogon, and cornelian cherry, and 2 qian of northen schisandra, decoct in water and take. Adjustments can be made to this formula naturally, effectively treating regurgitation.</p>
<p>The symptoms of regurgitation, though not immediately fatal, if treated improperly, can lead to death. Regurgitation is often due to kidney deficiency without fire. Therefore, if food is eaten today, it may be vomited by tomorrow, as stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that food consumes the person then exits. Food entering the stomach and then being vomited seems like a stomach problem. However, the kidneys serve as the gatekeeper for the stomach; if the kidneys are ill, the stomach will also become ill. For food to enter the stomach, it must be aided by kidney fluids, and the throat must have pathways for moisture to enable proper digestion. </p>
<p>Without fire in the kidneys, there is no fuel for the pot, so how can it steam the water and grain? This leads to cold in the kidneys and spleen; a cold spleen cannot transform food, causing it to rise to the stomach, which cannot accept it, resulting in vomiting. The formula for settling the stomach includes: 3 taels of cooked rehmannia, 2 taels of cornelian cherry, 3 qian each of cinnamon and poria, decoct in water and take. One dose can stop vomiting, and ten can completely cure the illness. This treatment is for those who vomit from morning to night, and for those who vomit right after meals, do not use cinnamon. Instead, add 1 tael of ophiopogon and 1 qian of northen schisandra; this adjustment has proven effective. Both formulas are great for nourishing the water and fire in the kidneys without directly treating the stomach, proving to be more effective than treating the stomach itself.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If phlegm and water are vomited without seasonal cause, the reason is excessive consumption of cold drinks, which weakens the spleen and stomach Qi, making it unable to digest food. Food enters the stomach and transforms into cold water, leading to persistent vomiting. The remedy is red stone resin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidelines for Breath Regulation</strong></p>
<p>The Secret Essentials of Preservation of Life states: There are several types of stagnant qi in the diaphragm: some arise from deficiency of qi causing anger and obstruction, some from blood deficiency leading to injury from overwork, some from food stagnation, some from spleen deficiency damaging the original qi, some from phlegm and fire accumulation, some from emotional disturbances and desires, from overindulgence in drinking and sexual activity, resulting in the spleen and stomach being constrained, and the failure of yin and yang to interact, which leads to diaphragm disorders. </p>
<p>In practicing breath regulation, it is advisable to do so on an empty stomach. With both hands suspended, let the body fall down slightly while taking in a few breaths to allow the qi to fill the diaphragm. Both feet should step in a sequence of two and nine degrees, to relieve stagnant qi from the diaphragm. The weakness of the stomach can be remedied without medication.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Technique</strong>: When beginning this condition, start by adjusting your breathing while seated, following a cyclical counting of the cosmos. Visualize a pound of divine water descending into the dantian, subsequently guarding the back region, circulating through the chest, either focusing or dispersing. This practice may be performed in sitting or lying positions, with both movement and stillness, completing the practice in a hundred days.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Method</strong>: Push from the chest down to the navel, then allow the rising source water to cleanse it. Visualize the water from the kidney flowing along the back, washing out from the heart, and push down through the large intestine&#39;s nine bends.</p>
<p>For an upper diaphragmatic heat and lower diaphragmatic cold, with a dry mouth, the breath regulation method is to push from the heart down to the navel, then visualize kidney water rising to the back, flowing out to cleanse it gently, or breathe without forcing it. Alternatively, when visualizing the back, rest the tongue against the upper palate to allow salivation naturally.</p>
<p>For an upper diaphragmatic cold and lower diaphragmatic heat, the breath regulation method is to push from the heart down to the navel, then focus momentarily below the navel imagining a stream of water descending to the bladder, upwards to the tailbone, right up to the crown, allowing drops to flow back from the heart to the navel, rotating and cleansing.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case Study</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Records of the Historian,&quot; it is stated in the biography of Minister Cang: The prince of Qi had a young child who was ill. He summoned his ministers for diagnosis, checked the child&#39;s pulse, and said: &quot;The child is suffering from Qi distress.&quot; The illness caused him to be anxious and unable to eat, with intermittent vomiting. When he was slightly relieved of worry, he would eat and drink a little. I immediately prepared a medicine to help relieve the Qi, and on the first day, the Qi was reduced; on the second day, he was able to eat; by the third day, he was completely cured. This demonstrates that to understand a child&#39;s illness, one must diagnose their pulse to assess their heart Qi. If it is turbid and erratic, it is diagnosed as Yang obstruction. The pulse technique states: If the pulse is rapid and the sickness is difficult to resolve and inconsistent, then the primary issue lies within the heart. A strong, heated pulse throughout the body indicates a serious Yang condition, which is linked to the heart&#39;s predominance. Thus, anxiety leads to an inability to eat, resulting in obstruction of the collateral channels. If collateral channels are obstructed, blood can rise upward. When blood rises, it leads to death. This is born from a sorrowful heart, and the illness arises from worry.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: </p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Serving Parents,&quot; it mentions that a woman, the wife of Li Guan, suffered from a choking sensation in her throat as if something were lodged there, leading to food not going down and a feeling of fullness. Other medical treatments were ineffective. A doctor named Dai examined her pulse and identified it as phlegm blocking the throat. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; notes that the three yang combine to form a blockage. Wang Qiyuan further explained that an excess of yang leads to rejection when eating, preventing food from entering. First, they administered a medicinal powder to clear the channels, half of which successfully passed through, and then they used a pill to ensure the rest was expelled. After three times, food went down smoothly. They continued with a medicinal powder made from melon seeds, and she could eat heartily as she had in the past.</p>
<p>In &quot;Ben Shi Fang,&quot; it is stated that in &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; there was a case where a young woman suffered from similar symptoms, prompted to vomit immediately after consuming cakes or broths. During the Zhenguan period, it was noted that Xu Fengyu&#39;s brothers and others were acclaimed as skilled doctors, but despite imperial orders for treatment, the doctors exhausted their methods and were unable to cure her. She gradually grew weaker and eventually died. Suddenly, a guard suggested that taking donkey urine was very effective. She took two portions in the morning and later vomited only half of her food; after eating again in the afternoon, she took another two portions, and the vomiting subsided. Later reports indicated that five or six people in the palace suffered from similar symptoms, all taking the remedy at once with success. The medicine was somewhat toxic and should not be taken in excess. It was recommended to take two portions of hot urine, and for severely ill patients, to take it daily for good results.</p>
<p>Danxi noted that a middle-aged woman suffered from vomiting and was treated with a decoction of four herbs, adding harmonized white tangerine peel, a few peach kernels, sweet licorice, and strong red flowers boiled together, mixed with donkey urine to prevent any potential for worm infestations. After several dozen doses, she was stabilized.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A carpenter from Taizhou, aged twenty-seven, was diligent in his work and skilled in his craft. He had a wife who enjoyed drinking and had been suffering from a stomach ailment for half a year, showing a pale complexion, a thin and irregular pulse, and difficulty with urination which occurred only once every eight or nine days. His stools were dry and hard, resembling sheep droppings, and he was greatly weakened and fatigued. I diagnosed this as depleting vital energy and blood. I first administered a decoction of six gentlemen’s soup with added sugarcane juice, plus aconite and rhubarb. I waited until his stools were slightly more moist and instructed him to stop working and rest at home, consuming warm fresh cow&#39;s milk in small sips, finishing a cup each time, five to six times a day, gradually increasing to seven or eight times. He was advised not to eat any other food, including vegetables, fruits, porridge, or rice. After half a month, his stools became moist, and after a month, he was stable. However, he sometimes experienced dry mouth, likely due to the lingering effects of alcohol, so I suggested he drink a little sugarcane juice. After nearly two months, he was stable.</p>
<p>A man from Hangzhou, over forty years old, had suffered from nausea for two months. He felt dry in the mouth and had little appetite, sometimes not vomiting at all; when he did vomit, the food appeared coated in saliva and only relieved his chest discomfort afterwards. His pulse was thin, and when forceful, it was large and taut, likely due to his earlier use of harsh medicinal drugs in his youth. At this time, it was early autumn and still hot, so I recommended that he frequently prepare bamboo sap, cooking poppy seeds into porridge to replace his usual meals. He was instructed to take only one or two sips at a time and to drink warm fluids regularly. From then on, he did not vomit. As the days grew cooler, I suggested making thin porridge with running water, adding a little bamboo sap, and after a while, incorporating four substances (herbs) soup with aged tangerine peel to nourish his blood.

Upon examining her, I noted that her pulse was tight and slippery, indicating phlegm in the upper abdomen. I prescribed Er Chen Decoction with ginger juice and bamboo juice. Zhang&#39;s uncle Yuan asked if Banxia was too drying. I replied, &quot;The damp phlegm fills the middle; without this treatment, it cannot be resolved.&quot; After four doses, the illness showed no improvement, so I switched to Da Banxia Decoction, which she took for four doses, at which point the chest pain ceased. After another four doses, the choking sensation also lessened, and after taking twenty doses in total, she felt well. If Banxia were used improperly and replaced with other medicines, could healing be expected? Only those with little phlegm and not overweight should avoid this treatment.</p>
<p>In Jiangyou, the scholar Fang Chunhe, nearing fifty, became overly emotional and angry, suffering from choking for three months. He consumed a cup of powdered drink daily and half a cup of fermented fluid, vomiting some. His six pulses were thin and soft, indicative of a condition of deficient cold. I prescribed the Lizhong Decoction with added human milk, ginger juice, white honey, and Banxia. His condition improved after one dose; after ten doses, he could consume gruel daily. I then added the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with bamboo juice and ginger juice for forty doses, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>

I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, peach kernel, cow&#39;s milk, white honey, and ginger juice for a total of ten doses, which gradually reduced the froth.

After more than ten days, he could not even consume congee, consistently vomiting whatever he ate, experiencing constipation, and believing he was destined to die. He sought a diagnosis from me, and I examined his pulse, which was strong, indicating this was not a terminal condition. I prescribed a concoction of wine-steamed rhubarb, combined with peach kernel, angelica, cardamom, and dried tangerine peel, formed into honey pills for him to take.

<p>The &quot;Medical Canon&quot; states: A man, fifty-three years old, developed a choking sensation during the summer and autumn, suffering from stomach pain, unable to eat; or after eating, food would regurgitate long after, experiencing dry, hard stools, and exhibiting significant blackening and emaciation. He sought treatment from me, and upon examining his pulse, I found the right wrist pulse vigorous and strong before the joint, slightly deep and small after the joint, while the left wrist showed a sinking and wiry pulse in all three positions, and a weak pulse at the extremity. I concluded that this was a case of insufficient vital energy, with Wood overpowering Earth, damp heat in the upper burner causing phlegm accumulation, and blood deficiency in the lower burner leading to dry, hardened stools. The upward surge of Yin fire was blocking the entrance and thus preventing food intake. I used a formula of Four Substances to generate blood, Four Gentlemen to tonify Qi, and Two Chen to eliminate phlegm, combining them with ginger-fried rhubarb, stir-fried bitter orange, and a few grains of cardamom, alongside occasional bowel-softening pills or Danxi&#39;s phlegm-reducing pills.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After three days, having taken five taels of ginseng and one jin of red stone resin powder, both were expelled through the bowels. Even though there was food, there was still vomiting, but not of the medicine. I thought that perhaps if I mixed the dregs of the medicine with a type of porridge, there might be a hope for it to stay in the stomach a little longer, and then it could pass through the intestines more slowly. So, I took ginseng and aged tangerine peel, cutting them into pieces the size of mustard seeds, and boiled them with millet into porridge, consuming half a bowl at a time without vomiting. After a while, I had another half bowl. This was repeated for three days before my stomach felt slightly more settled. However, my intestines were still empty, so I formed pills of red stone resin, swallowing two with ginseng soup each time. After three more days, my stools were still loose. During these three days of the ginseng-tangerine porridge, I added aged grains and consumed a bowl over ten times a day, leading to great relief. I continued to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction in pill form, ultimately using nine taels of ginseng, and I fully recovered. This was also because the fetus had not yet been expelled, retaining a thread of life to continue, which allowed for this method to sustain its existence. Otherwise, even with much ginseng, how could it possibly restore vitality in the realm of nothingness?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Huang Zhi was suffering from a disease affecting his diaphragm for over twenty days, not having taken any food or drink. When I examined him, his pulse was absent and weak. I asked about his bowel movements; since the onset of his illness, he had not had a single one, only a constant stream of phlegm rising, causing discomfort without resolution. There was a man named Shi in the town, skilled in discerning life and death, who said that his pulse had departed from its root and would soon fail. I disagreed, saying that the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; clearly states that if there is a pulse in the upper body but none in the lower, the person should vomit; if they do not, they will die, but if they do vomit, they may not necessarily die. As long as the proper qi descends, the pathways in the body will naturally open. Therefore, this condition must be treated cautiously, as the elevated qi does not return and the inner pathways are closed, leading to a critical state. I planned to treat him slowly according to my methods, anticipating gradual improvement.</p>
<p>Thus, I took full responsibility for the treatment, to observe the results. I changed the formula to one incorporating Xuanfu and Daizhe instead of strictly adhering to the formulaic approach. Given that the patient had no pulse at the wrist, I could not assess whether he was pregnant. If he was and I mistakenly treated him with Daizheshi or Ganjiang, it could seriously harm him and cut off his breath. So, I decided to replace Daizheshi with Chishizhi and Ganjiang with softened ginger. I administered a decoction of Liu Junzi Tang with Xuanfu flowers, which eased the vomiting somewhat. His father-in-law saw that I was using ginseng and believed it would exacerbate the illness and lead to regret.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

If it is cured, I will take not a single coin.&quot; Thus, I focused my spirit on treatment, personally adjusting the medicine, and began the administration. After three days, the vomiting gradually ceased. After another three days, the porridge and drinks were gradually increased, and the whole family was very pleased. However, the patient had not had a bowel movement for over a month. On one hand, there was concern about the unresolved illness, and on the other hand, worry about the food not being digested, urging for measures to promote bowel movements at every moment. I said: &quot;The stagnation of internal energy has persisted for a long time. When food and drink enter the stomach, they can only pass through one or two sections of the intestines each day. If the food and drink accumulate for a long time, the internal energy will naturally become unobstructed. The original plan was for a gradual treatment; how can we rush this?&quot; The whole family unanimously found me unsympathetic, each time I took the pulse, I could hear the patient&#39;s breath becoming more pronounced, though they had not yet begun to curse. I feared that the herbs for moistening the intestines would cause nausea, and the herbs for clearing the intestines might harm the pregnancy and result in death. I hesitated to comply with their requests and insisted on waiting three to five days; eventually, the internal energy moved down into the intestines and the illness was fully cured. After the patient recovered, the family secretly discussed: &quot;If even one bowel movement could not occur, how could the physician be of any value?&quot; After over a month, the pregnancy gradually became noticeable, and they discussed: &quot;If even a pregnancy cannot be detected, how can it be deemed valuable?&quot; Alas! My sincere efforts, aimed at protecting the couple and their child, only led to slander; what more could there be! It is only because I was slandered by the so-called physicians of this world that I was able to gain recognition.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

When yang energy is excessive, the yin vessels are impaired; if the yin vessels are impaired, blood is retained; if blood is retained, yin energy becomes excessive. When yin energy is excessive, yang energy cannot nourish; hence it is called “closure.” When yang energy is excessive, yin energy cannot nourish; hence it is called “stagnation.” When both yin and yang are excessive, they cannot support each other, so it is called “closure and stagnation.” Those in the state of closure and stagnation cannot die at their appointed time.

Qi Bo replied: When emotions are out of balance, when food and drink are irregular, and when temperatures are inappropriate, then cold juice flows within the intestines. When it flows within the intestines, the worms become cold; when the worms are cold, they accumulate. When they become lodged in the lower passage, the intestines and stomach are filled with stagnation, and the protective Qi fails to nourish, allowing evil Qi to dwell there.

Therefore, it is said that excess and overflow represent the true pulse of the organs, leading to death without illness. The classic says that qi exclusively circulates in the five organs, without engaging in the six bowels; why is that? Indeed. Qi flows as water does, without pause, hence the yin pulse nourishes the five organs while the yang pulse nourishes the six bowels, resembling a ring without end, where its course is unknown, ending and beginning anew.

The master replied: This is to induce sweating, leading to a slight yang, causing the diaphragm qi to be empty, resulting in a rapid pulse. The rapid pulse represents an external heat that cannot digest food, due to coolness and emptiness in the stomach. A wiry pulse indicates emptiness; the stomach qi is insufficient, leading to morning food being vomited in the evening, which is termed stomach reflux. Cold accumulates above, but the physician treats below, resulting in a wiry pulse, hence it is called empty. The pulse at the inch is thin and rapid; thin means no qi, no qi leads to a deficiency of nourishment, and deficiency of nourishment results in cold in the chest. The pulse at the foot yang is floating and slippery; floating indicates emptiness, and emptiness damages the spleen. Injury to the spleen does not digest food, leading to morning food being vomited in the evening or evening food in the morning, with undigested grains, termed stomach reflux. A tight and slippery pulse indicates a difficult condition to treat. If vomiting occurs immediately after eating, one should administer Da Huang Gan Cao Decoction. For those with stomach reflux and vomiting, Da Ban Xia Decoction is prescribed. For individuals with stomach reflux and thirst desiring water, Fu Ling Ze Xie Decoction is recommended. For all types of vomiting where grains cannot descend, Xiao Ban Xia Decoction should be used. **Middle Storehouse Classic** [Han, Hua Tuo] **The Theory of Yin and Yang Dysfunction**"},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"When yang energy rises but does not descend, it is called \"negation\"; when yin energy descends but does not rise, it is also called \"negation.\" When yang energy descends but does not rise, it is called \"stagnation\"; when yin energy rises but does not descend, it is likewise called \"stagnation.\" The terms negation and stagnation imply that yin and yang do not mutually support each other. When yang rushes upward, it scorches the spleen and lungs, leading to jaundice, characterized by yellow and red colors, all arising from the extreme of yang. When yin moves downward, it freezes the kidneys and liver, resulting in syncope, characterized by blue and black colors, all stemming from the extreme of yin. Jaundice pertains to yellow jaundice, and syncope refers to cold syncope, both arising from the obstruction of the interaction between yin and yang. Where yang is scorched, treat with water; where yin is obstructed, assist with fire. This illustrates the way in which yin and yang complement each other. Pulses: The strong pulse signifies heat in the chest before the guan, and upon reaching the guan, it transforms into nausea, heavy as thousands. Regarding the obstruction discourse: \"Records of Ancient and Modern Examples\" states: The five types of obstruction are due to worry, labor, food, and thought. Qi obstruction relates to palpitations and a lack of flow, leading to nausea and chest pain. Worry obstruction occurs when oppressive conditions cause reverse qi, resulting in palpitations below the heart and cold extremities. Labor obstruction leads to prolonged discomfort in the side and fullness below the ribs, causing cold extremities unable to warm themselves. Food obstruction happens when little is consumed, yet there is constant discomfort and pain in the chest, impeding breath. Thought obstruction results in palpitations, absent-mindedness, and restless eyes. All these arose from concerns, anger, and cold qi entering the chest and sides."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"**Anti-Stomach Acidity** When the stomach is tight, the person feels fullness in the chest and cannot eat, leading to vomiting. If this vomiting stops, food cannot be ingested. If one continues to experience this, it is termed \"stomach reversal,\" hence the tightness is slightly exacerbated. The pulse at the foot yang is floating and tight; a floating pulse indicates deficiency, while tightness harms the spleen. When the spleen is harmed, digestion fails, resulting in morning vomiting of last night's food and evening vomiting of the day's meal. If food fails to digest, it is called \"stomach reversal.\" A tight and weak pulse at the foot yang indicates a difficult-to-treat condition. **Esophageal Obstruction** The \"Suwen\" states that a knot in the yang pulse is called an obstruction. This pertains to the coalescing of qi and spirit as yang. When relaxed, qi and spirit are calm; when overworked, they deplete. If there are inappropriate temperatures or imbalanced foods, or emotional disturbances, both qi and spirit become agitated, causing the yang qi to knot, while the yin qi becomes disturbed. This results in disharmony between yin and yang, leading to organ disorders. If an obstruction occurs in the chest, it is called \"obstructive qi,\" and if it remains in the throat, it leads to five types of choking. The five obstructions are caused by worries, anger, cold, heat, and qi disturbances; the five choke types come from worries, overthinking, labor, and eating issues. The symptoms include chest tightness, feelings of oppression, nausea, choking sensations, hindrance in eating, chest pain radiating to the back, discomfort below the ribs, a feeling of restlessness, and difficulty in swallowing. The treatment method involves regulating yin and yang, transforming phlegm, dispersing qi, achieving balance between yin and yang, which allows for smooth qi and phlegm downwards, resolving obstructions. Moreover, when there is deficiency below and qi rising, it causes a firm fullness in the heart area, discomfort in the muscles, pain like a needle, and difficulty bending or stretching, known as chest obstruction."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"The Confucian Way of Serving One's Parents 【Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng】 An Analysis of the Division of the Ten and the Fifteen Classes of Disorders Disorders began with the nest of the Chao clan. The loss of the essence also began with this nest. Why is this? Laozi said: \"Less leads to gain, more leads to confusion.\" Moreover, it is commonly said that choking on food is connected to the \"Inner Canon\" which says little more, only that the three yangs belong to the diaphragm. The three yangs refer to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder. \"Congested\" means heat accumulation. If there is heat accumulation in the small intestine, the blood vessels become dry; if in the large intestine, there is inability to defecate; if in the bladder, bodily fluids dry up. When the three yangs are congested, both front and back are obstructed. When the lower passage does not open, it must reverse and move upwards, resulting in food not being able to descend properly, even if it does, it comes back up. The stomach is known as the sea of water and grains, daily receiving the new to replace the old, leading to regular bowel movements. Now those who suffer from choking are often unable to pass stool for three, five, or even five to seven days, which clearly indicates a deviation from this regularity."},{"anchor":"trans-15p","marker":"15p","type":"translation","text":"Is it not the case that the three Yang energies are all congealed below, causing the large intestine to dry up, leading to the foods consumed being rejected by the throat? Even if they enter the great warehouse, they still emerge from the throat; this is the Yang fire not being pushed down but instead rising. Therefore, the classics say: \"When Shao Yang reaches, it causes vomiting and leakage, and food does not go down.\" Isn't this reasoning clear? Furthermore, the \"Treatise on Qi Disorders\" states: \"When the liver transmits cold to the heart, it causes madness in the diaphragm. The Yang energy is weakened by cold; hence, there is impeded digestion and obstruction in the diaphragm; this is due to the interaction of Yang and cold, not solely dependent on cold.\" The \"Six Qi and Organ Patterns\" also states: \"The pulse of 'Ren Ying' above four fullnesses signifies an obstruction of Yang.\" Wang Taipu remarked: \"When Yang is at its peak, it obstructs and rejects, causing food to fail to enter.\" The \"Zheng Li Lun\" states: \"Obstruction causes vomiting and regurgitation.\" Thus, the diaphragm must also be in a state of obstruction. Later generations hastily divided conditions into five types of choking, attributing them to worries over Qi, food, and labor. Later still, they divided them into ten types of obstruction and five types of choking, leading to a plethora of classifications and increasing confusion. The issue of overeating in a person does not usually manifest all at once. Initially, it may cause harm from alcohol and food, or stomach heat might induce vomiting, or dizziness from wind might lead to vomiting."},{"anchor":"trans-16p","marker":"16p","type":"translation","text":"The physicians do not investigate the root cause; they burn ginger in the fire and boil cinnamon in broth.

If it is due to harm from drinking, one can only eliminate the drink; if it is due to harm from eating, one can only eliminate the food. How can one claim deficiency and then use heating tonics? Those who originally have no excess heat are still not within the scope of treatment. Those with pre-existing heat in the body will inevitably have the three yangs converge. Once the three yangs converge, food will inevitably rise. The physician still claims the stomach is cold and cannot accept; burning needles into flesh, moxibustion scorching the skin, enduring countless agonies. The heat of the three yangs converging is clear, but treatment is difficult; merely withdrawing stimuli is of utmost importance. It is like trying to stop boiling water with more heat—painful and counterproductive. Over time, this has led to mistakes by physicians. People say to descend the yang and nourish the yin, opening the eyes and sticking out the tongue, fearing harm to the original energy, but all is merely about maintaining harmony, obstructed and unresponsive, without any way forward.

In our time, Liu Hejian's treatment for obstructed qi and food, using the Three承气 Decoction, stands out uniquely in modernity. I now suggest to future generations that when using medicine, they should carefully consider the dosage. If the obstruction has persisted for a long time, do not attack aggressively. Even if one manages to resolve the obstruction, one must be cautious of future issues. It is best to first moisten and nourish the body with smaller doses of medicinal pills, gradually increasing them until the blockage naturally eases. If there is choking or obstruction, resulting in phlegm, one can lightly use bitter and sour herbs to gently induce flow, and then treat accordingly; the medicine will be more effective. If that does not work, one can guide with honey and salt, ensuring a continuous interaction between the two medicines, promoting dispersion and consumption of stagnation.

The point to be selected is Sanli. The throat is the gateway for swallowing food, while the diaphragm separates the heart and lungs. When there is an obstruction, the ascending and descending vital energies cannot communicate freely. It is also said that if clear energy is in the lower region, it leads to food retention, resulting in diarrhea that is yellow and like paste, indicating that grains are not being digested. Conversely, if turbid energy rises, it causes abdominal distension, leading to difficulties in defecation; either constipation or diarrhea may ensue. When the turbid energy is stuck above and should descend but does not, the yin energy drawn in by the kidneys and liver cannot move downwards and instead remains trapped, causing the stomach's energy to rebel upwards, resulting in nausea, vomiting, or belching. This is due to the upward surge of yin fire conflicting with the incoming energy, preventing food from being ingested.

Thus, when grains enter but cannot ascend or descend, it results in food retention. The space between the throat and diaphragm is severely obstructed, preventing communication, all of which is caused by the counterflow of the penetrating vessel. Stomach ailments cause upward disruption in both flanks, and with the throat and diaphragm not open, food cannot descend, so one must choose points on the stomach meridian (Zu San Li). The \"Classic of Acupuncture\" states that when clear and turbid energies are mixed and disordered in the chest, it is called great disturbance. Great disturbance refers to confusion. When energy does not circulate properly, it is a critical condition. If not urgently addressed, various changes will occur. Treatment principle: When there is insufficient yang energy and excess yin energy, one should first tonify the yang and then drain the yin; this ensures that yang energy rises in the yang aspect before draining yin.

When this dryness occurs in the upper burner (at the cardia), food cannot descend, causing pain in the stomach, which persists until vomiting occurs to relieve the suffering. The cardia is the upper opening of the stomach, where food and drink rush in, and the qi is transmitted to the lungs.

When dryness is in the upper part, fluids can pass, but food is difficult to enter, hence it is called dysphagia; when the dryness is in the lower part, food may enter but is later expelled after a long time, hence it is called nausea. Both conditions are generally referred to as \"the diaphragm,\" which is why the \"Inner Canon\" only mentions \"the diaphragm\" as a term for the three yang blockages. According to ancient texts, there are three kinds of vomiting: vomiting from the upper jiao is due to qi, where food leads to violent vomiting; vomiting from the middle jiao is due to accumulation, sometimes preceded by pain or followed by pain after vomiting; vomiting from the lower jiao is due to cold, where morning food is expelled in the evening and evening food in the morning. Cao's school divides the symptoms into five types of dysphagia and ten types of diaphragm conditions, which makes the categorization overly complex and confusing. Only Zhang Jifeng suggests that such illness arises from within one's own contemplation and requires inner observation and quiet nurturing, which deeply resonates with the condition of illness. Generally speaking, the depletion of qi and blood, compounded by sadness, worry, and anger, injures the spleen and stomach, gradually depleting the blood, causing stagnant qi to generate phlegm, which then blocks and obstructs pathways, making it difficult for food and drink to enter—this results in dysphagia. When the spleen and stomach are weakly injured and lose their functions, they are unable to properly digest grains and transform them into essences. Thus, morning food is expelled in the evening and evening food in the morning; although food may enter the stomach, it will return and be rejected—this is how nausea arises. Both conditions occur in the area of the diaphragm, hence the common designation as \"the diaphragm.\" The vomiting associated with dysphagia corresponds to the upper jiao vomiting in ancient texts; the vomiting associated with nausea corresponds to the lower jiao vomiting. Wang Taibu states: if food cannot enter, it indicates the presence of heat; if food enters and then is expelled, it indicates the absence of heat."},{"anchor":"trans-47p","marker":"47p","type":"translation","text":"Generally, obstruction and choking predominantly relate to heat, while nausea usually corresponds to cold. However, one should not be overly rigid in this approach. If the pulse is strong and large, one should treat it as heat; if the pulse is weak and small, it should be treated as cold. A yellowish-white complexion that appears withered indicates deficiency and cold; a reddish complexion that is lustrous indicates excess and heat. By correlating the pulse with symptoms and the complexion with the pulse, one can avoid errors. As the classics state: \"Those who can unite color and pulse can achieve completeness.\" The difficulty in diagnosing this condition arises because if one wishes to strengthen the spleen and regulate phlegm, there are concerns that drying agents may hinder body fluids; if one wishes to nourish blood and generate fluids, there is worry that moistening agents may obstruct the middle. One should carefully assess whether there is injury to yin with excessive fire, in which case nourishing blood should be prioritized; or if there is spleen injury with excess yin, warming and tonifying should come first."},{"anchor":"trans-48p","marker":"48p","type":"translation","text":"There are also concerns of distress and blockage, with fire stagnating and unable to disperse. The spirit is not greatly weakened, and the pulse still has strength. One should use the methods of Cang Gong and He Jian to treat it. A small amount of medicinal pills should be used repeatedly, and the blockage will naturally resolve itself. If phlegm in the diaphragm is excessive and subtly surging, one should treat it with downward medication; the efficacy of the medicine will easily take effect. If for some reason it does not work, one can guide the treatment with honey and salt, which will help to naturally open up the channels. All of this is a distinction between the vacuous and the solid, the yin and the yang, and is crucial in the balance during diagnosis and treatment. Some may become stuck on texts like the \"Jinkui\" or \"Jufang,\" overly favoring pungent warming methods, while others may get fixated on the \"Yuji\" or \"Xinfang,\" favoring clear and moistening treatments. Such tendencies rely on the appropriateness of the illness and the treatment, rather than adhering strictly to a method of treating the illness. For any symptoms of reflux that improve with medication, one must not immediately provide congee or rice. Instead, use five qian of ginseng, two qian of dried tangerine peel, and one liang of aged rice to make a soup for delicate sipping. Only after ten days can congee be offered.

Those with chest and abdominal pain as if cut by a knife will die. ### Pulse Diagnosis A tight and slippery pulse indicates vomiting; a small, weak, and slippery pulse suggests reverse stomach action. A deep, slow, and weak pulse, or a large but weak pulse, indicates Qi deficiency; a rapid and weak pulse, or a thin and weak pulse, indicates blood deficiency. A wiry pulse indicates phlegm, as does a slippery pulse. A tight pulse at the inch and a weak pulse at the cubit indicates fullness in the chest, leading to inability to eat and subsequent vomiting. Furthermore, the \"Nanjing\" states: when the pulse is leathery, it signifies vomiting. ### Discussion on Food Obstruction The terms food obstruction, reversed stomach, and closed gates are distinct, the causes are entirely different, and treatment should be differentiated; one must discern them. Food obstruction occurs when one is hungry and desires food but experiences blockage in the throat and chest area, above the stomach. It has not yet entered the stomach, and mucus and saliva come out. Once it enters the stomach, nothing fails to digest and nothing returns. This condition is primarily found in older men; the young do not experience food obstruction. Reversed stomach occurs when food intake is excessive but ends with the morning meal being vomited in the evening, or the evening meal being vomited in the morning, or vomiting occurring after one or two meals, or after accumulating for a day and night, leading to unbearable bloating in the abdomen and subsequent vomiting of the original substances in an undigested, sour, and foul state. This means that it has entered the stomach and is now being expelled, hence it is called reversed stomach. This condition can occur in men and women of all ages."},{"anchor":"trans-50p","marker":"50p","type":"translation","text":"The condition known as \"Guan Ge\" is described as being unable to eat even a grain of rice; when thirsty, one prefers to drink tea or water, but soon feels the need to expel it. Repeated attempts to drink lead to further expulsion. When taking medicine, hot medicine is immediately rejected, and cold medicine takes a longer time to be expelled. There is also constipation, referred to as Guan Ge. \"Guan\" means that substances cannot exit the lower part, while \"Ge\" indicates that substances cannot enter the upper part. This condition is often seen in women. Regarding the obstruction caused by food in the throat, Danxi claims it arises from the seven emotions and six desires, leading to a transformation of heat rising and a lack of descent. This causes a buildup of phlegm and fluid, providing temporary relief during moments of discomfort, only to resurge soon after. When previous medicines are taken again, they accumulate heat, and blood and fluid become depleted, leading to a dry and withered state in the stomach area. When dryness occurs near the throat, water can pass through, but food is difficult to consume, leading to a condition known as \"Yè\" or obstruction. If this dryness is located nearer to the stomach, food can enter but is hard to retain, leading to a long delay before it exits the body, referred to as \"Ge\" or reversed stomach. Bowel movements are infrequent, resembling the consistency of sheep feces."},{"anchor":"trans-51p","marker":"51p","type":"translation","text":"One must avoid the six excesses externally and regulate the seven emotions internally. By nurturing oneself with appropriate food and drink to nourish the blood and generate fluids, the body will be free from the flames of heat, the kidneys will gradually produce water, and when the qi is clear and the blood is harmonious, the spleen will function well, allowing for the digestion and transformation of food. Danxi's discussions are quite clever, but his explanations about choking and reversed stomach conditions lack clarity. I particularly appreciate his idea of the fiery transformation rising up and the kidneys gradually producing water, as it keenly identifies the source of illness. However, I regret that his understanding remains somewhat superficial; he emphasizes nourishing the blood but does not directly explore the original essence within the kidneys. Therefore, his treatment methods involve formulas rich in animal milk, along with substances like bamboo sap and leek juice, which resolve phlegm and stasis but address only the symptoms rather than the root cause. Does one not understand that the \"Neijing\" originally does not have much discourse but simply states that the three yang conditions signify a blockage? The three yang refer to the large intestine, small intestine, and bladder, and blockage signifies heat accumulation. The large intestine governs fluids, while the small intestine governs liquids. If there is heat accumulation in the large intestine, fluids are depleted; if there is heat accumulation in the small intestine, liquids dry up. The bladder is the governing official of the region, storing fluids. If there is heat accumulation in the bladder, the fluids are exhausted."},{"anchor":"trans-52p","marker":"52p","type":"translation","text":"However, how does the \"Three Yangs\" lead to heat accumulation? All of it is due to kidney disease. The kidneys govern the five bodily fluids and regulate both urination and defecation; they are considered one organ with the bladder. When kidney water is depleted and yang fire becomes excessive, it boils the fluids, resulting in heat accumulation of the \"Three Yangs.\" This leads to blockage both anteriorly and posteriorly, causing difficulties in excretion; hence, it must counteract upward, impacting the pathways of clarity, and overflows into the throat, causing difficulty in swallowing food. Why can water be ingested while food is hard to swallow? Food enters the yin aspect and nourishes the yang, which elevates the fire in the stomach, making it hard to intake; water, being more yin in nature, resonates well and thus can be ingested. When one spits white foam, it is due to the water they consumed boiling and rising. When feces resemble sheep droppings, it indicates that little food has been consumed, and the residue has been fully absorbed, resulting in dry and narrow intestines. These symptoms are often found in men over the age of fifty who have developed such conditions externally. Moreover, such individuals usually do not curb their desires. If inquiring about the cause, they might shy away from discussing their ailments and instead cite recent emotional distress, experiencing much stagnation as a result. It is my belief that this stagnation certainly exists, and they may indulge in activities to alleviate their worries, which is often the case, perhaps 80 to 90 percent of the time, and it may not require further elaboration."},{"anchor":"trans-53p","marker":"53p","type":"translation","text":"However, the old man's innocence has long disappeared, leaving only the solitary yang, focusing primarily on nourishing yin.

A lack of water hinders the mastery of water, and a lack of fire diminishes the source of fire. Zhu Shizhong stated: To treat an upper ailment, one must use large doses of Liuwei Dihuang pill decocted for drinking; long-term use can recover roughly one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is also necessary to abstain from indulging desires, avoiding certain rooms, and maintaining a bland diet. If one claims to warm the stomach, the stomach is inherently not cold; if one claims to tonify the stomach, the stomach is not deficient; if one claims to alleviate stagnation, aromatic and dry items should not assist fire. The \"Jufang Feihua\" already has clear explanations, stating that Liu from Hejian uses purgative methods which can damage the stomach with excessive cold, leading to further depletion of fluids.

I came across a medical case in historical texts stating that a patient with vomiting had undigested food coming up until the next morning. The doctor administered warming gastric medicine, but it was ineffective, and the pulse was very faint and weak. A national expert examined the case and noted that the medicines used were not addressing the patient's condition effectively, leaving the doctor perplexed. Reading Dong Yuan’s writings, it is stated that vomiting has three causes: accumulation of qi, cold, and cold in the lower region. Upper jiao vomiting is due to qi, middle jiao vomiting is due to accumulation, and lower jiao is due to cold. In this case, the pulse is deep and slow, with morning nausea and evening vomiting, and small bowel movements but constipation. This indicates lower jiao vomiting. The treatment should focus on relieving the blockage and warming the cold. Therefore, we specifically treat the lower jiao, dispelling the cold, and gradually harmonizing with middle jiao remedies to promote recovery. From this, we see that lower jiao vomiting is due to weakened fire at the gate of life, like a pot without fuel, unable to simmer the fluids and food in the stomach, leading to bloating and inevitable vomiting."},{"anchor":"trans-55p","marker":"55p","type":"translation","text":"The so-called prolonged consumption leading to depletion is indeed a lack of fire.

Not understanding this, one merely uses hawthorn or Shenqu to flatten the stomach and digest food, which only hastens demise. Regarding the condition of \"Guan Ge,\" it arises suddenly and manifests as a violent illness. Symptoms include constipation, thirst for water, occasional vomiting, alternating between drinking and vomiting, dry lips, slightly red eyes, and either a flushed or unflushed face. In severe cases, there may be chest pain or not, while the patient loses all desire to eat from the onset of illness, unable to swallow even a drop of water, and vomiting half a cup after drinking one.

This combines the human urine and the bile of pigs, which are salty, bitter, and cold in nature, into the Bai Tong Decoction. The qi must correspond to one another to dispel the cold that obstructs. If the pulse gradually emerges after taking the medicine, life is likely; if the pulse suddenly emerges, death is imminent. Tao Jie'an's \"Kai Che Chui\" contains a remarkable recipe for \"Hui Yang Fan Ben Decoction.\" After recovery, one should regularly take the Ba Wei Pill to prevent recurrence. Moreover, there is a type of liver fire condition where vomiting occurs but nothing can be retained; the vomit consists of sour water, bitter water, or blue-green water, while bowel movements remain normal. It can also cause heart pain. This is a case of stagnant fire and wood. The stagnation of wood must be resolved and the fire released.

Occasionally, some, without the guidance of a master, formulate prescriptions based on their own understanding and pass them down in texts, but they remain as fleeting gold dust in their eyes, unsuitable for practical use. What can one do about this? I humbly express this with a respectful discussion of the underlying principles. The \"Su Wen\" states that the manifestation of a major illness in the lesser yang is represented by one sign, in the greater yang by two, in the yangming by three, and anything beyond that is classified as closing the yang; in the cun-kou (pulse), a major illness in the jueyin is shown by one sign, in the shaoyin by two, in the taiyin by three, and anything beyond that is classified as closing the yin."},{"anchor":"trans-58p","marker":"58p","type":"translation","text":"When the pulse at the Renying and the Cun position is strong, if it exceeds four times, it indicates a blockage. A weakened pulse at the blockage cannot reach the essence of the universe and will lead to death.

The needling methods are applied according to the flow of the Renying and Cun meridians. The \"Spiritual Pivot\" states that acupuncture should address the excess Yang by draining it and supplementing the corresponding Yin, employing two drainages and one supplementation. Similarly, for the Cun, excess Yin is drained while supplementing the corresponding Yang, also using two drainages and one supplementation, all of which should cease when the Qi is harmonized. Regarding herbal treatment, it is important to assess the pulses at the wrists' Cun, Guan, and Chi positions to differentiate the Yin and Yang of the organs. Therefore, the \"Spiritual Pivot\" further states that when pathology is in the organs, the Yang pulse is out of harmony; when the Yang pulse is out of harmony, Qi stagnates, and when Qi stagnates, Yang Qi becomes excessive.

This is the balance used in medicine, determining treatment according to the pulse's measurements of excessive yin and yang. The people of Yue regard this as significant, expressing it as a pulse where yin dominates over yang. They interpret excess yang as being like overflow and entry as coverage, depicting the phenomenon of yin and yang being skewed and unable to revert accurately. Later, Zhongjing established three major principles: he stated that a floating and large pulse at the cun position indicates emptiness, while the size indicates solidity; at the chi position, it is a barrier, and at the cun, it is a block. If there is a barrier, one cannot urinate easily, and with a block, there may be vomiting.

This is one principle: when the heart pulse is ample and long, it indicates the essence of the heart’s pulse. If the upper pulse is slight and the head small, sweating occurs; if the lower pulse is large, then obstruction results, and urination cannot take place. If there is no sweating in the head, treatment is possible; if sweating occurs, death follows. This clearly illustrates the source of the obstruction, which stems from the fire of the five emotions being trapped within the heart's membrane. The upper pulse appearing slight with a small head indicates Yang deficiency, while the lower pulse appearing large indicates Yang excess. If there is no sweating in the head, treatment is feasible; if there is sweating, the heart’s essence is lost, leading to self-immolation.

However, one does not wish future generations to settle comfortably into these views, nor can one bear to remain silent. It is said that when yin and yang shift places, the condition is termed as \"blockage.\" If yang energy is consistently present in the chest, it leads to heat as the primary illness; if yin energy is consistently present below the waist, it leads to cold as the primary illness. If there is cold in the chest, one should treat it with heat; if there is heat in the lower dantian, one should treat it with cold. If there is a combination of cold and heat in the chest, treatment should be based on the primary and secondary principles. The treatment for the primary condition should be gentle, while treatment for the secondary condition should be urgent. This stems from the \"Treatise on Cold Damage,\" where cold is present in the chest and heat in the lower dantian, asserting the viewpoint that is indeed not necessarily linked to blockage as a fundamental condition.

Can the vital signs of near-death be seized and dictated by dominant techniques influencing yin and yang? By using Fu Yang as a diagnostic tool, Zhang Jing aimed for harmony in the guarding and nutritive Qi, seeking neither bias toward yin nor toward yang, advocating for a balanced approach without confrontation, allowing the stomach's Qi to naturally assert itself. From one to nine, and then to eight, seven, four, and six, one may begin to achieve equilibrium. Can this be accomplished in one stroke?

The邪气 in the stomach obstructs the mechanism of ascent and descent of yin and yang, preventing them from interacting with the middle earth. Thus, yin cannot rise and becomes trapped below, causing cold pain in the lower abdomen; yang cannot descend and remains solely in the upper body, leading to heat in the chest and a desire to vomit. This decoction indeed facilitates the proper ascent and descent of yin and yang.

Later generations have forced interpretations that fail to capture the essence of the formula, yet how can they modify the prescription? Typhoid fever is typically divided into three treatments: exterior, interior, and central. When both exterior and interior邪气 are strong, one should harmonize from the center, which is why there is the harmonizing method of Xiao Chaihu Decoction, combining Ren Shen, Gan Cao, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao to support the stomach, while adding one ingredient of Chaihu to facilitate the exterior and one ingredient of Huangqin to penetrate the interior."},{"anchor":"trans-66p","marker":"66p","type":"translation","text":"There is still a fear that the essence may be insufficiently exposed, which can be detrimental to harmony.

As for the evils within the lower dantian and the chest, they are situated above and below and are not considered exterior or interior. Therefore, one should transform Chai Hu Decoction into Huang Lian Decoction to harmonize these areas. Replace Chai Hu with Gui Zhi, Huang Qin with Huang Lian, and fresh ginger with dried ginger.

However, if the stomach's gate is already closed, the lesser yin governs closure, and the qi of the lesser yin does not rise, the stomach’s gate cannot open. Chang Yi stated that the pulse of the lesser yin is deep and stagnant, while that of the foot yang is prone and slack—both are causes for concern. The Nei Jing often reiterates this: when the kidney qi is solely deep, it is said to be unbalanced. The true qi in the kidney is akin to a balance scale; if there is both weight and balance, the gate opens and closes at intervals; if there is weight but no balance, the gate is closed and cannot open. How then can the small urine be released? Thus, the kidney qi pill embodies all matters of retreating.

This is evident from discussions found in various sections such as the \"Six Seasonal Organs,\" \"Beginning and End,\" \"Prohibitions on Medicines,\" and discussions regarding pulse measurements and meridians. Since these insights are so significant, we can understand their weight. Originating from the writings of the Qin dynasty's Yue people, there are three difficulties mentioned: \"Upper fish\" indicates overflow, signifying the external blockage in \"guan\"; \"Inner measurement\" indicates overturning, signifying the internal blockage in \"ge.\" Discussing \"guan ge\" in these terms has strayed from their original meaning in the canon. Moreover, Zhongjing states: at the pulse point of the \"chi\" (尺) is \"guan,\" while at the pulse point of the \"cun\" (寸) is \"ge.\" If \"guan\" is affected, urination is impaired; if \"ge,\" then there is vomiting and regurgitation. Thus, from the time of Shuhe and Dongyuan onwards, this understanding has been tradition, and eventually, the notion of \"guan ge\" has been lost entirely. Later, Danxi mentioned: this condition often leads to death.

Moreover, if the pulse is large like this, it is floating and has no root, its emptiness is evident; how can it be expelled? This is erroneous and indeed the worst error! The Inner Classic states that the renying pulse can be four times strong, and the cunkou pulse can also be four times; these are not to be taken literally about their size, but rather indicate an expulsion of food stagnation; to say one cannot urinate indicates urinary retention. Each of these two conditions has its own criteria, and how does it relate to the diagnosis of guangu? This is true for you students—why should it be different in other cases? How can we then expect those who treat such conditions to be free from error? The guangu diagnosis in the Inner Classic is originally examined through the renying pulse for the yang of the six fu organs, and the cunkou pulse examines the yin of the five zang organs. When the renying pulse is exceedingly strong, exceeding four times, this indicates the solitary yang of the yangming channel; the water does not assist the fire, hence it is termed gu阳. Gu阳 refers to the yin being constrained by the yang. When the cunkou pulse is exceedingly strong, exceeding four times, this indicates that the ta阴 channel has no main yin, and the qi does not return to the essence, hence it is termed gu阴. Gu阴 refers to the yang intervening with the yin. If both the renying and cunkou pulses are strong to the level of four times or more, both large and numerous, this indicates that the yang qi does not accumulate, thus there is no yang within the yin, and the yin qi does not rise, hence there is no yin within the yang; yin and yang are separated, hence it is named guangu. All those who observe this condition are generally affected by excessive drinking and indulgence, and emotional desires harm the essence; thus, the yang cannot maintain its residence, leading to a floating pulse that is exposed and excessively strong.

Therefore, whenever the inch pulse is extremely large, even four times its expected size, and both large and numerous, it indicates a pulse of guan ge, which should not be mistaken for a fire condition. I have diagnosed several individuals with this pulse, and upon observation, it felt like a string or leather, abnormally large—hence I say four times. Observing its symptoms, the pulse movement corresponds with body movement, particularly noticeable in the voids beneath the breasts and in the motions around the navel; all appear active and resonant, responding with the pulse. In examining its form and energy, there is slight wheezing above, and upon movement, the wheezing intensifies. The limbs lack strength, and there are frequent states of anxiety during wakefulness and sleep, leading one to deem it a deficiency without cough or blood loss symptoms, or if judged to be phlegm-fire, it lacks signs of a true pathogenic heat.

This addresses pulse symptoms comprehensively. If one speaks in terms of pulse, it resembles the prior four-fold conditions. If one speaks in terms of symptoms, there are cases where both yin and yang are vigorous, with a yang condition extreme in its yang aspect and a yin condition extreme in its yin aspect. In general, when yang is exceeding in yang, one should proceed to purge, yet if the yin aspect reveals itself, it cannot be purged; when yin is extreme in yin, one should proceed to replenish, yet if the yang aspect reveals itself, it cannot be replenished. In such instances, yang exists solely in the yang without any yin, and yin exists solely in the yin without any yang. They are isolated, unable to interact, and thus cannot be supplemented nor purged. This is also a symptom of 'Guan Ge' and leads to death.

Additionally, one must observe the cold and heat within the deficiency, as well as the balance of yin and yang, and treat accordingly for optimal results. In \"Guan Ge\" syndrome, if there is a combination with yang organs, there will be excess heat, so treatments like Yinxian Decoction, Left Kidney Decoction, and Left Kidney Pill should be administered.

Furthermore, all human visceral qi involves the reception by the stomach, the transformation by the spleen, and the kidneys serving as the foundation of water and fire, the origin of transformation. Now, if food and drink are obstructed and not functioning, or if stool is dry and cannot be passed, is this not a failure of transformation and a disorder of blood circulation? The authority governing the circulation of blood in the upper body lies with the spleen; in the lower body, it lies with the kidneys.

In cases of reversed stomach, the food can still enter the body but then comes back out, hence called \"reversed stomach\"; in cases of blocked throat, there is an obstruction preventing food from going down, hence called \"blocked throat.\" When food enters and then comes back out, it is due to yang deficiency that cannot transform; this can be supplemented and warmed, making treatment relatively easy. When food cannot go down, it is due to qi stagnation that cannot move; treatment may either require unblocking or assisting, thus making the process more difficult. This reflects the differences in severity. Furthermore, those suffering from reversed stomach often can still eat, while those with blocked throat cannot eat. The illness of blocked throat is located in the chest and upper jiao, while the illness of reversed stomach is located in the middle and lower jiao. This is a distinction in the symptoms. Therefore, the treatment for reversed stomach often needs to boost the source of fire to assist in transformation, while the treatment for blocked throat often needs to nourish the heart and spleen to alleviate the stagnation of qi. Since the symptoms are different, diagnosis and treatment should also be categorized accordingly. The condition of blocked throat often accompanies constipation.

If the lower part is not open, it must flow upward, which causes difficulty in swallowing food; even if it goes down, it comes back up. This is due to the yang fire pushing upwards instead of descending. In my humble opinion, this interpretation is quite incorrect. The meaning of \"block\" in the context of the \"Inner Canon\" does not primarily refer to heat, as this text states: \"When yin and yang are blocked, there is more yin and less yang, which is called stone water.\" Furthermore, it is mentioned in the discussion of pain: \"Thinking causes the qi to become blocked.\" Is it thus correct to equate blockage with heat? Moreover, heat facilitates flow, while cold causes condensation; this is a fundamental principle of yin and yang. Indeed, frost condenses into ice only in extreme cold, and heat does not do so. This is an evident truth of the natural order. The principles of yin and yang in the human body are no different; only humans cannot fully comprehend them, leading to many misunderstandings.

Zihé did not discern this and ultimately attributed the obstruction of the three yang channels entirely to heat, leading future generations to universally interpret it as fire—how misguided is that! However, diseases associated with obstructions do not stem from a single source; in fact, both qi and blood can become obstructed, and both yang and yin can lead to their own types of obstructions. I do not mean to say that all obstructions are cold and devoid of heat; rather, yin obstructions and yang obstructions manifest differently, and this distinction must not be overlooked. Yang obstruction is indeed a heat obstruction, arising from fire's excessive disturbance of yin, causing it to congeal. This only occurs with exterior pathogens invading the interior or with true heat in the yangming channel. Moreover, heat obstructions must be accompanied by symptoms such as thirst, fever, and other signs, which are easily identifiable, clearly reflected in the pulse being forceful, large, slippery, and solid. If there is obstruction below but no signs of heat above, this indicates a yin obstruction—how can one claim it to be heat? The essence of yin obstruction lies in the lack of fire in the life gate, leading to inadequate transformation of essence and resulting in congealment below, with the flow of treatment stagnated.

The condition of food obstruction has often been considered by ancient scholars to be due to cold. Since Liu Hejian treated food obstruction with the Three Chengqi Decoction, Zhang Zihe has discussed the complete binding of the three yangs as being due to heat, also stating that a person's overeating does not happen suddenly: it may either injure due to food or drink, or due to heat in the stomach causing a desire to vomit. If physicians do not understand the root cause and instead prescribe aromatic herbs, cassia, pepper, and cloves, how can they assert weakness and then supplement with heat? For those with inherent heat, the three yangs will certainly bind, and food will easily ascend. Yet physicians still argue that the stomach is cold and cannot accept food, cauterizing with needles and moxibustion; as the three yangs become increasingly bound over time, they eventually lead to food obstruction. I find this reasoning puzzling. Food obstruction arises from dryness and is not fundamentally a sign of true heat. Is the Three Chengqi Decoction still applicable? Liu Hejian's view appears inaccurate. Moreover, an excess of meat and wine does not necessarily lead to food obstruction; is it the case that all who suffer from food obstruction are people with inherent heat?

It may also come from a full constitution without sweating, or a naturally irritable temper causing liver fire to rise, resulting in stagnation of bodily fluids, which makes qi unwell.

For those who initially feel that food is not digesting well, and who are not severely aged, a prompt use of Da Jian Pi Wan (Great Spleen Strengthening Pill), or pills made with musk, ginseng, ginger, and zhigao (bitter orange), to regulate spleen qi is the best strategy; Shaoyao Zhi Zhu Wan (Pill with Peony and Bitter Orange) may also work. If there is both obstruction and constipation due to lack of fire and stagnation, merely observe for dryness of blood and deficiency of yin. In this case, Wufu Drink or Daying Decoction, with a few coins of alcohol to wash meat cistanche, should be decocted and consumed. Alternatively, using pig gall to gradually moisten from below while treating the upper part with spleen-regulating remedies is the best approach. One may also consume more cow or sheep milk products to nourish the essence and gradually moisturize, avoiding any impatience! If both qi and blood are not greatly depleted but there is significant stagnation in the lower abdomen, it may become necessary to temporarily alleviate it.

This is most concerning: if the root cause isn't swiftly remedied, how can the spleen's qi be restored? If warming and tonifying methods cause greater obstruction, one must reluctantly adjust the treatment. Yet, it is crucial to carefully select from the foundational qi to ensure safety. Even if after using tonics no immediate effect is seen, as long as there is no blockage, it indicates a fitting combination of medicine and ailment. This condition is particularly difficult to treat. If the patient can tolerate tonics, they must take them in substantial amounts to gradually see results and achieve full recovery.

If urgent remedies are sought for immediate relief, employing drastic measures such as Da Huang (rhubarb), Mang Xiao (bitter salt), San Leng (sparganii rhizome), E Zhu (curcuma), Yu Jin (curcuma), Tao Ren (peach kernel), or rolling phlegm pills will not yield results; they will only damage gastric qi, leading to inevitable deterioration. This is hastening towards demise and must be carefully considered. In treating throat obstruction, traditional practices rely on ginseng and astragalus to tonify the original qi, while using rice and millet to detoxify and strengthen the stomach, bamboo juice to clear phlegm and disperse masses, dried ginger to warm the center, fresh ginger to eliminate impurities, cow and sheep milk to nourish blood and moisten fluids, as well as honey and angelica to relieve dryness.

When food enters the stomach, it warms the spleen and strengthens it, leading to complete digestion; how could it then be rejected? Various schools of thought suggest it is due to phlegm or excess heat. They do not realize that the retention of phlegm and fluid stems from a weakness in the stomach, causing undigested food to be expelled — how could it be considered properly digested? Wang Taibu said, \"If there is obstruction in the stomach causing nausea and food cannot be taken in, this indicates the presence of fire; but if food comes back up after being ingested, this indicates a lack of fire.\" This statement is indeed comprehensive. However, even without fire, it is essential to discern between the upper, middle, and lower jiaos, as different conditions apply. If cold is present in the upper jiao, it often results in nausea or a general feeling of wanting to vomit; this indicates a deficiency of yang in the stomach. If cold is in the middle jiao, then the food does not digest, and may be expelled shortly after, indicating a deficiency of yang within the stomach. If cold is in the lower jiao, it can lead to morning vomiting of food eaten the previous evening, or evening vomiting of food eaten in the morning; this occurs because food enters the pylorus but cannot be transformed by the fire, resulting in expulsion due to prolonged retention, indicative of a deficiency of yang at the life gate (ming men).

It may stem from excessive drinking leading to dampness from alcohol, or from overeating cold foods that deplete the true yang. It could also be due to emotional distress that exhausts the internal energy. In summary, this is primarily a case of internal injury, which weakens the stomach energy. Therefore, any treatment for this should focus on supporting the righteous energy, strengthening the spleen, and nourishing the stomach. For new cases where the stomach energy has not yet deteriorated significantly, if the food has not been digested, one should also remove the stagnation. If there is still rebellious qi, it is essential to also resolve the stagnation. In cases that have persisted for a longer time, or for those with inherent weak energy, one should specifically apply warming and reinforcing treatments. It is crucial to avoid mixing treatments improperly, recklessly using harsh and drastic remedies such as those for digesting food and resolving phlegm, which could severely injure the stomach energy and lead to further complications.

If one merely seeks immediate results without addressing the root cause, there may be temporary relief, but the true yin will become further depleted. Therefore, in treating this condition, if one observes deficiency of yin along with cold, the main approach should be to tonify the yang, significantly incorporating ingredients like angelica, cistanche, leek juice, and ginger juice. If there is deficiency of yin accompanied by heat, the main approach should be to nourish the yin, adding substances like milk, children's urine, ghee, honey, pig fat, and various types of blood.

At this point, taking Xiao Yao San with ten grams of Huai Lian can stop it. However, many doctors do not understand the treatment method and instead use ingredients like Xiang Sha, Hou Po, Zhi Ke, and Sha Ren, which do not work; they then switch to using Da Huang and Ba Dou, which also fail. Next, they try cooling herbs like Huang Lian, Huang Bo, Huang Qin, Zhi Zi, and Zhi Mu, but this too is ineffective. They try warming herbs such as Gui Zhi, Bai Guo, Rou Gui, Fu Zi, Gan Jiang, and Wu Zhu Yu, yet there is still no response. Finally, they use dispersing herbs like Chai Hu, Jing Jie, Jie Geng, Fang Feng, and Su Zi, resulting in the condition of reflux. Now, I pass on a formula: one ounce of Shu Di, four coins of Shan Zhu Yu, three coins of Mai Dong, one coin each of Bei Wu Wei, Yuan Shen, Dang Gui, and Bai Jie Zi, and two coins of Niu Xi, boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in not treating the reflux directly, which is precisely how to treat it. The reason for reflux is the depletion of Yin water in the kidneys. When kidney water is insufficient, the large and small intestines cannot be sufficiently moistened, leading to dryness. With dry intestines, food entering the stomach cannot descend and must instead be vomited back up. Therefore, the method of treatment should not focus on the upper part but rather on the lower."},{"anchor":"trans-92p","marker":"92p","type":"translation","text":"The formula employs prepared rehmannia and shan zhu yu, which are purely for replenishing the water in the kidneys. When kidney water is sufficient, the large intestine is also nourished with water, allowing it to expand and properly accommodate substances. When the pathway for water is wide, boats of all sizes can navigate freely; hence, there is no fear that a small boat cannot transport grain. This treatment is appropriate for a deficiency of water in the kidneys that fails to moisten the large intestine. However, if the kidneys are cold and deficient, this method is not suitable. Although the name \"reversal of stomach\" may be the same, the actual condition differs. Reversal due to a lack of water in the kidneys causes immediate vomiting upon swallowing food, while reversal from a lack of fire in the kidneys results in delayed vomiting, where food is retained until the next day before being expelled. For example, food eaten today may only be vomited out the next day. The formula includes one tael of prepared rehmannia, four qian of shan zhu yu, three qian of mai dong, two qian each of shan yao and fu ling, one qian each of northern wuweizi, dan pi, ze xie, niu xi, fu zi, and rou gui, and is decocted in water for consumption. This is the eight-ingredient pill soup. The key lies in using fu zi and rou gui to nourish kidney water while also addressing the fire within the water. Nourishing the fire helps to rejuvenate the life-gate fire. The qi of the spleen and stomach must rely on the life-gate fire to be generated; like a pot without fire, how can it cook? Without it, the water is cold and metal is chilled, leading to frost. One must first restore the initial warmth of yang to resolve this."},{"anchor":"trans-93p","marker":"93p","type":"translation","text":"The human body’s spleen and stomach function similarly; however, in the case of illnesses caused by cold and chill, one usually experiences abdominal pain and distress. Yet, if there are no such symptoms now, what could be the reason for the upward sensation accompanied by vomiting? It is because when the spleen and stomach have a passage, the cold pathogenic energy does not remain within. Now, with the upward forces releasing through the mouth and throat, the gastric entrance has become a broad avenue, allowing for free passage without obstruction. Thus, the energy easily flows, and there is no need for it to accumulate within the central region, lurking in the heart and abdomen, causing cold to generate heat that brings suffering to the spleen and stomach. This, in fact, is what allows for the absence of pain in the heart and abdomen. This is not merely about treating the symptoms of vomiting but rather addressing the root cause of it; this marks the beginning of transformative methods for treating diseases. When food enters and quickly exits, it is due to the deficiency of kidney water, which fails to moisten the throat, leading to dryness and an immediate expulsion. When food lingers and then is expelled, it is due to the deficiency of kidney fire, which cannot warm the spleen, resulting in cold in the spleen and subsequent expulsion. To treat the symptoms of vomiting, it is essential to address the kidneys and to differentiate whether there is fire or no fire; doing so can transform potentially fatal symptoms into life-sustaining outcomes. The ideal remedy for the symptoms of vomiting is to use Zhang Jing’s Rehmannia Decoction. If there is no fire, one should add Aconite and Cinnamon, which will yield beneficial results just as before. However, some people may use Zhang Jing’s prescriptions without achieving results. Why is this? It is due to improperly applying the method, rather than any deficiency in the formulas themselves. Now, regarding the two prescriptions: one for treating vomiting without fire includes one ounce of cooked Rehmannia, one ounce of Sichuan Cornelian cherry, and three qian each of Aconite, Poria, Water Plantain, Moutan Peony, and Cinnamon, along with one qian of Chinese Yam, to be decocted and consumed."},{"anchor":"trans-94p","marker":"94p","type":"translation","text":"For treating fire and regurgitation, use: 2 taels of cooked rehmannia, 1 tael of yam, 3 qian each of alisma and processed moutan root, 5 qian each of poria, ophiopogon, and cornelian cherry, and 2 qian of northen schisandra, decoct in water and take. Adjustments can be made to this formula naturally, effectively treating regurgitation. The symptoms of regurgitation, though not immediately fatal, if treated improperly, can lead to death. Regurgitation is often due to kidney deficiency without fire. Therefore, if food is eaten today, it may be vomited by tomorrow, as stated in the \"Inner Canon\" that food consumes the person then exits. Food entering the stomach and then being vomited seems like a stomach problem. However, the kidneys serve as the gatekeeper for the stomach; if the kidneys are ill, the stomach will also become ill. For food to enter the stomach, it must be aided by kidney fluids, and the throat must have pathways for moisture to enable proper digestion. Without fire in the kidneys, there is no fuel for the pot, so how can it steam the water and grain? This leads to cold in the kidneys and spleen; a cold spleen cannot transform food, causing it to rise to the stomach, which cannot accept it, resulting in vomiting. The formula for settling the stomach includes: 3 taels of cooked rehmannia, 2 taels of cornelian cherry, 3 qian each of cinnamon and poria, decoct in water and take. One dose can stop vomiting, and ten can completely cure the illness. This treatment is for those who vomit from morning to night, and for those who vomit right after meals, do not use cinnamon.

In practicing breath regulation, it is advisable to do so on an empty stomach. With both hands suspended, let the body fall down slightly while taking in a few breaths to allow the qi to fill the diaphragm. Both feet should step in a sequence of two and nine degrees, to relieve stagnant qi from the diaphragm. The weakness of the stomach can be remedied without medication. **Practice Technique**: When beginning this condition, start by adjusting your breathing while seated, following a cyclical counting of the cosmos. Visualize a pound of divine water descending into the dantian, subsequently guarding the back region, circulating through the chest, either focusing or dispersing. This practice may be performed in sitting or lying positions, with both movement and stillness, completing the practice in a hundred days. **Additional Method**: Push from the chest down to the navel, then allow the rising source water to cleanse it. Visualize the water from the kidney flowing along the back, washing out from the heart, and push down through the large intestine's nine bends. For an upper diaphragmatic heat and lower diaphragmatic cold, with a dry mouth, the breath regulation method is to push from the heart down to the navel, then visualize kidney water rising to the back, flowing out to cleanse it gently, or breathe without forcing it. Alternatively, when visualizing the back, rest the tongue against the upper palate to allow salivation naturally. For an upper diaphragmatic cold and lower diaphragmatic heat, the breath regulation method is to push from the heart down to the navel, then focus momentarily below the navel imagining a stream of water descending to the bladder, upwards to the tailbone, right up to the crown, allowing drops to flow back from the heart to the navel, rotating and cleansing."},{"anchor":"trans-138p","marker":"138p","type":"translation","text":"**Medical Case Study** In the \"Records of the Historian,\" it is stated in the biography of Minister Cang: The prince of Qi had a young child who was ill.

When he was slightly relieved of worry, he would eat and drink a little. I immediately prepared a medicine to help relieve the Qi, and on the first day, the Qi was reduced; on the second day, he was able to eat; by the third day, he was completely cured. This demonstrates that to understand a child's illness, one must diagnose their pulse to assess their heart Qi. If it is turbid and erratic, it is diagnosed as Yang obstruction. The pulse technique states: If the pulse is rapid and the sickness is difficult to resolve and inconsistent, then the primary issue lies within the heart. A strong, heated pulse throughout the body indicates a serious Yang condition, which is linked to the heart's predominance. Thus, anxiety leads to an inability to eat, resulting in obstruction of the collateral channels. If collateral channels are obstructed, blood can rise upward. When blood rises, it leads to death.

Upon examining her, I noted that her pulse was tight and slippery, indicating phlegm in the upper abdomen. I prescribed Er Chen Decoction with ginger juice and bamboo juice. Zhang's uncle Yuan asked if Banxia was too drying. I replied, \"The damp phlegm fills the middle; without this treatment, it cannot be resolved.\" After four doses, the illness showed no improvement, so I switched to Da Banxia Decoction, which she took for four doses, at which point the chest pain ceased. After another four doses, the choking sensation also lessened, and after taking twenty doses in total, she felt well. If Banxia were used improperly and replaced with other medicines, could healing be expected? Only those with little phlegm and not overweight should avoid this treatment. In Jiangyou, the scholar Fang Chunhe, nearing fifty, became overly emotional and angry, suffering from choking for three months. He consumed a cup of powdered drink daily and half a cup of fermented fluid, vomiting some. His six pulses were thin and soft, indicative of a condition of deficient cold. I prescribed the Lizhong Decoction with added human milk, ginger juice, white honey, and Banxia. His condition improved after one dose; after ten doses, he could consume gruel daily. I then added the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with bamboo juice and ginger juice for forty doses, and all symptoms were resolved. In Nandu, Xu Fengcheng complained of an obstruction in his throat, unable to swallow solid substances, relying solely on human milk and several cups of alcohol, producing ongoing frothy saliva. When he sought treatment from me, I remarked, \"The presence of white froth means it is not treatable.\" Although his pulse was not yet weakened, I hoped for the best. I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, peach kernel, cow's milk, white honey, and ginger juice for a total of ten doses, which gradually reduced the froth. By doubling the doses of ginseng and atractylodes, he was completely well after three months."},{"anchor":"trans-143p","marker":"143p","type":"translation","text":"In the twenty-fifth year of Jiading, Qian Yuan suffered from deep sorrow due to the death of a relative, leading to excessive grief that rendered him unable to eat. After more than ten days, he could not even consume congee, consistently vomiting whatever he ate, experiencing constipation, and believing he was destined to die. He sought a diagnosis from me, and I examined his pulse, which was strong, indicating this was not a terminal condition. I prescribed a concoction of wine-steamed rhubarb, combined with peach kernel, angelica, cardamom, and dried tangerine peel, formed into honey pills for him to take. After five doses, he had a significant bowel movement with much dry stool and blood, and his illness seemed to dissipate. Within a few days, he was able to eat double the usual amount. The \"Medical Canon\" states: A man, fifty-three years old, developed a choking sensation during the summer and autumn, suffering from stomach pain, unable to eat; or after eating, food would regurgitate long after, experiencing dry, hard stools, and exhibiting significant blackening and emaciation. He sought treatment from me, and upon examining his pulse, I found the right wrist pulse vigorous and strong before the joint, slightly deep and small after the joint, while the left wrist showed a sinking and wiry pulse in all three positions, and a weak pulse at the extremity. I concluded that this was a case of insufficient vital energy, with Wood overpowering Earth, damp heat in the upper burner causing phlegm accumulation, and blood deficiency in the lower burner leading to dry, hardened stools. The upward surge of Yin fire was blocking the entrance and thus preventing food intake. I used a formula of Four Substances to generate blood, Four Gentlemen to tonify Qi, and Two Chen to eliminate phlegm, combining them with ginger-fried rhubarb, stir-fried bitter orange, and a few grains of cardamom, alongside occasional bowel-softening pills or Danxi's phlegm-reducing pills.

As spring arrived, she initially did not notice it. She continued to eat chicken noodles and eggs, which led to food-related cold damage, and her condition took a month to improve. However, she continued to suffer from digestive issues, experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in a cycle of sickness for a total of seventy days, with five relapses. Eventually, she developed a symptom of \"stomach obstruction,\" unable to retain any food or drink. Upon examination, her pulse surged chaotically, and pressure revealed no strength; she was constantly vomiting, her sounds as faint as insect chirps, only occasionally producing a loud retch. I said: the patient has no food or water in her stomach, completely emptied and turned outward; this is a condition that cannot be saved. Sixuan must seek effective treatment to avoid my regret. After deliberating for a long time, I advised: if absolutely necessary, a significant amount of ginseng must be used. However, as soon as it enters her stomach, it would pass straight through her intestines, likening it to spending a large fortune yet not achieving any benefit; what can be done? She replied: It is still within ten taels, and can be managed. I said: That is sufficient! Thus, I prepared a ginseng decoction mixed with powdered red stone fat to settle and stabilize her overturned stomach. Gradually, the patient's energy began to recover, and after a while, her bowel gas was released."},{"anchor":"trans-145p","marker":"145p","type":"translation","text":"After three days, having taken five taels of ginseng and one jin of red stone resin powder, both were expelled through the bowels. Even though there was food, there was still vomiting, but not of the medicine. I thought that perhaps if I mixed the dregs of the medicine with a type of porridge, there might be a hope for it to stay in the stomach a little longer, and then it could pass through the intestines more slowly. So, I took ginseng and aged tangerine peel, cutting them into pieces the size of mustard seeds, and boiled them with millet into porridge, consuming half a bowl at a time without vomiting. After a while, I had another half bowl. This was repeated for three days before my stomach felt slightly more settled. However, my intestines were still empty, so I formed pills of red stone resin, swallowing two with ginseng soup each time. After three more days, my stools were still loose. During these three days of the ginseng-tangerine porridge, I added aged grains and consumed a bowl over ten times a day, leading to great relief. I continued to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction in pill form, ultimately using nine taels of ginseng, and I fully recovered. This was also because the fetus had not yet been expelled, retaining a thread of life to continue, which allowed for this method to sustain its existence. Otherwise, even with much ginseng, how could it possibly restore vitality in the realm of nothingness?

When I examined him, his pulse was absent and weak. I asked about his bowel movements; since the onset of his illness, he had not had a single one, only a constant stream of phlegm rising, causing discomfort without resolution. There was a man named Shi in the town, skilled in discerning life and death, who said that his pulse had departed from its root and would soon fail. I disagreed, saying that the \"Pulse Classic\" clearly states that if there is a pulse in the upper body but none in the lower, the person should vomit; if they do not, they will die, but if they do vomit, they may not necessarily die. As long as the proper qi descends, the pathways in the body will naturally open. Therefore, this condition must be treated cautiously, as the elevated qi does not return and the inner pathways are closed, leading to a critical state. I planned to treat him slowly according to my methods, anticipating gradual improvement. Thus, I took full responsibility for the treatment, to observe the results. I changed the formula to one incorporating Xuanfu and Daizhe instead of strictly adhering to the formulaic approach. Given that the patient had no pulse at the wrist, I could not assess whether he was pregnant. If he was and I mistakenly treated him with Daizheshi or Ganjiang, it could seriously harm him and cut off his breath. So, I decided to replace Daizheshi with Chishizhi and Ganjiang with softened ginger. I administered a decoction of Liu Junzi Tang with Xuanfu flowers, which eased the vomiting somewhat. His father-in-law saw that I was using ginseng and believed it would exacerbate the illness and lead to regret."},{"anchor":"trans-147p","marker":"147p","type":"translation","text":"I said: \"Do not fear! If this illness is not cured, I will take thirty pieces of silver as a penalty. If it is cured, I will take not a single coin.\" Thus, I focused my spirit on treatment, personally adjusting the medicine, and began the administration. After three days, the vomiting gradually ceased. After another three days, the porridge and drinks were gradually increased, and the whole family was very pleased. However, the patient had not had a bowel movement for over a month. On one hand, there was concern about the unresolved illness, and on the other hand, worry about the food not being digested, urging for measures to promote bowel movements at every moment. I said: \"The stagnation of internal energy has persisted for a long time. When food and drink enter the stomach, they can only pass through one or two sections of the intestines each day. If the food and drink accumulate for a long time, the internal energy will naturally become unobstructed. The original plan was for a gradual treatment; how can we rush this?\" The whole family unanimously found me unsympathetic, each time I took the pulse, I could hear the patient's breath becoming more pronounced, though they had not yet begun to curse. I feared that the herbs for moistening the intestines would cause nausea, and the herbs for clearing the intestines might harm the pregnancy and result in death. I hesitated to comply with their requests and insisted on waiting three to five days; eventually, the internal energy moved down into the intestines and the illness was fully cured. After the patient recovered, the family secretly discussed: \"If even one bowel movement could not occur, how could the physician be of any value?\" After over a month, the pregnancy gradually became noticeable, and they discussed: \"If even a pregnancy cannot be detected, how can it be deemed valuable?\" Alas! My sincere efforts, aimed at protecting the couple and their child, only led to slander; what more could there be!
