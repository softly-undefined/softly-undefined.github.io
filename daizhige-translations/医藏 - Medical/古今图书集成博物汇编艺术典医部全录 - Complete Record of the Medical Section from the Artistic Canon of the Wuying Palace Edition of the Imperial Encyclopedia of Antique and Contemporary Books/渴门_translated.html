<p>The Gate of Thirst</p>
<p>by the Yellow Emperor&#39;s Plain Questions</p>
<p>On the Discussion of Reality and Falsehood<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Consumption, with a full and large pulse, can be treated if the illness has persisted for a long time; if the pulse is weak and small, it cannot be treated after a long duration. </p>
<p>[Note: The essence and energy of the five organs are all deficient, transforming into heat. The heat consumes the muscles, causing consumption. A full and large pulse indicates that the essence and blood are still abundant, thus it can be treated. A weak and thin pulse indicates a gradual decline in essence and energy, making treatment difficult.]</p>
<p>In treating consumption, collapse, paralysis, atrophy, qi obstruction, rebellion, the illness of the wealthy and plump is that of sorghum.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When the heart&#39;s coldness moves to the lungs, the lungs consume. If the lungs consume, drinking does not help, and death is inevitable. </p>
<p>[Note: The lungs are the source of metal and water. Coldness from heart fire diminishes lung essence, so drinking does not help, leading to death as there is no remedy.]</p>
<p>When the heart&#39;s heat moves to the lungs, this causes diaphragm consumption.</p>
<p>[Note: The heart and lungs are situated above the diaphragm; when fire heat transfers to the lung metal, the fluid of metal and water gets depleted, leading to exhaustion of the fluids above the diaphragm, causing thirst.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treating Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of kidney heat illness, there is first pain in the lower back and aching kidneys, intense thirst, frequent drinking, and body heat. </p>
<p>[Note: The lower back is the area of the kidneys, hence the pain here first. The kidneys govern the bones, thus the aching. The kidneys are water organs; when fluids cannot ascend, it leads to intense thirst and frequent drinking.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang Differences</strong></p>
<p>The convergence of two Yangs is called consumption. </p>
<p>[Note: The two Yangs refer to the Yangming stomach. When Yangming qi is obstructed, the fluids from food and water do not produce, leading to thirst as a result.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>Wind caused by drinking alcohol is termed &quot;leakage of wind.&quot; The symptoms of wind leakage may include excessive sweating, an inability to wear a single garment, sweating after eating, severe sweating of the body, breathlessness, aversion to wind, damp clothing, dry mouth, and thirst, leading to an inability to engage in labor. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Strange Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What is the name of the illness characterized by a sweet mouth? How does one contract it?&quot; Qibo replied, &quot;This is an overflow of the five vital energies, known as &#39;spleen dampness.&#39; When five flavors enter the stomach, they are stored there, and the spleen facilitates the movement of their essence and energy. The fluids in the spleen cause the mouth to taste sweet, indicating an abundance of richness. Such individuals often consume sweet and rich foods. Excessive richness leads to internal heat, while sweetness causes fullness, hence their energy overflows and turns into diabetes. Treat this with orchid, to disperse the stagnant qi.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Essential Truths</strong></p>
<p>For the Shaoyang recovery, the throat is parched and dry, leading to thirst for liquids. The throat&#39;s dryness indicates damage to the lung’s metal element. Thirst for liquids indicates dryness in the stomach and metal. The Taiyang governs the heavens, causes the throat to dry and parched, and if severe, the complexion flushes, leading to thirst and a desire to drink. This is because the cold affects the heart fire, forcing the fire energy to rise and become inflamed.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Qi Transformation and Changes</strong></p>
<p>In years when the water element is excessively strong and cold air prevails, it harms the heart fire, causing the people to suffer from thirst and to err in their judgments. [Note: The spleen&#39;s inability to transport its fluids leads to thirst.]</p>
<p><strong>The Suwen (Plain Questions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Five Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we diagnose a person who is prone to consumption? Shao Yu replied: Those whose five organs are soft and weak are prone to consumption. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know the softness and weakness of the five organs? Shao Yu replied: If someone is soft and weak, there must be strength somewhere. Strength often leads to anger, while softness is easily harmed. The Yellow Emperor asked: How do we differentiate between softness and strength? Shao Yu replied: This person&#39;s skin is thin, yet their eyes are deep and firm; they show an upright and assertive demeanor, indicating a strong heart. When strong, one is often angry, and anger causes the qi to reverse and accumulate in the chest, leading to turbulent blood flow. The hip skin becomes filled with muscle, and the blood vessels become stagnant, turning into heat, which then harms the skin, resulting in consumption. [Note: According to this text, there are two types of consumption: one regarding the five organs and the other regarding the muscles. Consumption of the five organs happens within, leading to thirst, while muscle consumption occurs externally, leading to emaciation. When essence and blood are deficient, it causes reverse qi to ascend, hence it is said that the soft and weak must have strength; it refers to the essence of the five organs being soft, while the qi is strong. Thus, the softer one becomes weaker, and the stronger one becomes stronger, leading to disharmony between strength and softness.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Section on Organs</strong></p>
<p>If the heart is weak, it is prone to disorders like wasting thirst and internal heat. If the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys are weak, they are all similarly prone to wasting thirst and are easily harmed.<br>(Note: The five organs are responsible for storing essence; when they are weak, bodily fluids are scant, leading to wasting thirst.)</p>
<p><strong>Section on Mastery and Transmission</strong></p>
<p>Excessive internal heat leads to coldness in the body, while conditions characterized by cold lead to heat.<br>(Note: &quot;Bian&quot; refers to the reversal of one&#39;s condition. Heat counters cold, and cold counters heat.)</p>
<p><strong>Section on the Manifestations of Evil Qi in Organs</strong></p>
<p>A faint pulse in the heart signifies wasting thirst; a very slippery pulse indicates excessive thirst.<br>(Note: Wasting thirst refers to the symptoms of the three types of wasting. The heart and lungs govern upper wasting, the spleen and stomach govern middle wasting, while the liver and kidneys govern lower wasting. A slippery pulse indicates abundant yang energy with heat; when this abundance occurs in the upper body, it leads to excessive thirst.) The pulse in the lungs is also faint, indicating wasting thirst.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Notes on the text:</strong></p>
<p>The lungs govern the essence and the generation of water.</p>
<p>The liver pulse is very small, which relates to excessive drinking; a slight decrease relates to consumption of essence. When small, both blood and energy are deficient, leading to excessive Wood and Fire.</p>
<p>The spleen pulse is small, indicating a deficiency that prevents the stomach from transporting its fluids.</p>
<p>The kidney pulse is small, indicating a deficiency of essence and blood.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On the Five Flavors</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Salty flavors expedite blood circulation; consuming a lot of this causes thirst. Why is this? Lesser Yu replied: Salty flavors enter the stomach, and their energy rises through the Middle Jiao, flowing into the pulses, thus causing blood and energy to move. When blood mixes with salty flavors, it coagulates; coagulation leads to the juices in the stomach being depleted, and when depleted, the throat becomes dry, resulting in a dry tongue that craves water. The blood vessels belong to the pathway of the Middle Jiao, therefore salty flavors enter and expedite blood circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: When salty flavors enter the stomach, their energy rises through the Middle Jiao and flows into the pulses, which is the nature of salinity rising. This affects blood and energy. Blood is the essence of the Middle Jiao, nourishing the spirit and transforming into red; since salty is associated with the taste of cold water, when blood and salt combine, it coagulates. This leads to dryness and blockage, depleting the juices in the stomach. When the juices are exhausted, the throat becomes dry, hence the tongue becomes dry and craves water.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Gold Coffer</strong> 【Han - Zhang Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p>The section on diabetes states: The illness of Jueyin manifests as diabetes, where qi rises to the heart, causing pain and heat within the heart, hunger without the desire to eat, and upon eating, one vomits worms; the condition does not cease with purging. The pulse at the inch position is floating and slow; floating indicates deficiency and slow indicates labor; deficiency suggests inadequate defensive qi, while labor implies exhausted qi. The Fuyang pulse is floating and rapid; floating denotes qi, and rapid suggests the consumption of grains leading to rigidity. When the qi is excessive, urination is frequent; frequent urination with hardness indicates diabetes. </p>
<p>For men with diabetes, if urination is excessive—drinking one dou leads to urinating one dou—Kidney Qi Pills are indicated. If the pulse is floating and urination is difficult, with slight heat and diabetes, it is advisable to promote urination and induce sweating, using the Wuling Powder. If one has the desire to drink water but vomits upon drinking, this is termed &quot;water reversal,&quot; treated with Wuling Powder. If one has an unceasing desire to drink water, Wenhacao Powder is indicated.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If one is thirsty and desires to drink due to a dry mouth and tongue, Baihu Jiajinseng Decoction is the remedy. If the pulse is floating and there is heat, along with thirst and difficulty in urination, Zhuling Decoction is the remedy. For those with difficulty in urination who suffer from water retention and intense thirst, Caoshe Louchu Mai Pill is the remedy. The chapter on Blood Bi states: in men with a pale complexion, it indicates thirst and loss of blood, sudden wheezing and palpitations, with a floating pulse indicating internal deficiency. The chapter on Lung Atrophy states: if heat is in the upper jiao, it causes cough leading to lung atrophy. How does one contract lung atrophy? The teacher says: it may arise from sweat loss, vomiting, diabetes with frequent urination, or from constipation and being subjected to quick-acting purgatives, which severely depletes body fluids, thus resulting in this condition.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>In cases of lung atrophy where there is spitting of frothy phlegm without coughing, the person will not feel thirsty and will likely have frequent urination. This occurs because the upper part is deficient and cannot control the lower part. This indicates that the lungs are cold and there will be dizziness and excessive salivation; therefore, Licorice and Dried Ginger Decoction is used to warm it. If after taking the decoction the person feels thirsty, it suggests a case of diabetes.</p>
<p>The Treatise on Phlegm and Fluid states that when there is retained fluid in the chest, the person will experience shortness of breath, thirst, and pain in the joints of the limbs, with a deep pulse indicating the presence of fluid retention. </p>
<p>If the person becomes thirsty first and then vomits, it indicates water accumulation in the lower part of the heart, belonging to the category of fluids; Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction is employed for treatment.</p>
<p>The Treatise on Water Qi states that in a case of taiyang disease with a floating and tight pulse accompanied by chills, this results from extreme deficiency leading to sweating. When thirsty without chills, it indicates skin edema; in such cases, thirst with diarrhea and frequent urination indicates that sweating should be avoided. </p>
<p>For interior water retention, the body will show yellow swelling in the face and eyes, with a deep pulse and difficulty in urination, indicating the presence of fluid. If urination is spontaneous, it suggests depletion of body fluids, leading to thirst. The prescription for this is that of Jue Bi Jia Shu Decoction.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>A person with water retention has visible eye bags, a fresh and radiant complexion, and a concealed pulse. This person suffers from excessive thirst, has water in the abdomen and difficulty in urination and defecation. If the pulse is deep and absent, there is water to be purged.</p>
<p>Question: After experiencing diarrhea, if there is thirst for water, difficulty in urination, and abdominal distention due to swelling, what does this indicate? Answer: This condition is due to water retention. If urination becomes spontaneous and sweating occurs, recovery will naturally follow.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the condition of yellow sweat, with body swelling, fever, sweating, and thirst, resembling edema, with perspiration staining clothing, the color being a true yellow like that of huangqin (scutellaria), and a naturally deep pulse, how is this condition acquired? The teacher replies: This is caused by sweating and then bathing in water; the water enters through the sweat pores. A suitable remedy is a decoction of astragalus, peony, and cinnamon wine.</p>
<p>The chapter on jaundice mentions: A deep pulse, thirst for water, and difficulty in urination indicate the onset of jaundice. If jaundice is accompanied by thirst, it is difficult to treat; if there is no thirst, the jaundice can be treated.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>If it arises from the lower yin, the person will surely vomit; if from the lower yang, the person will shiver with cold and develop heat. The &quot;Heart Palpitations Treatise&quot; states: If the patient presents with symptoms resembling heat, feels agitated, has a bloated feeling, and experiences a dry mouth and thirst, yet the pulse shows no signs of heat, this indicates an underlying yin obstruction and is caused by stagnant blood; it should be purged. The &quot;Vomiting Treatise&quot; states: If vomiting precedes thirst, this is a desire for relief. If thirst precedes vomiting, this indicates water is stagnant in the heart; it pertains to those with drinking issues. If someone originally feels thirsty but now has no thirst, it is due to stagnant drinking water in the heart; this relates to obstructed drinking. For those who vomit and then crave water, the main treatment is Poria and Clear Lake Decoction. If, after vomiting, there is a desire for water and excessive drinking, the main treatment is Clam Soup, which also addresses slight wind and tight headache. For diarrhea with mild heat and thirst, but a weak pulse, they will recover on their own. For diarrhea with a rapid pulse and thirst, they will recover on their own. If there are no discrepancies, it must be purulent blood, due to the presence of heat.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Techniques [Jin - Wang Shuhe]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulse Cautions</strong></p>
<p>The song of the spleen pulse states: The spleen pulse is both full and superficial; the middle is consumed, and the spleen and stomach are deficient. With a dry mouth and much thirst for water, overeating leads to physical weakness. The song of miscellaneous diseases states: Thin, rapid pulses in thirst indicate life, while weak, small pulses present deep difficulties and challenges for escape.</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions [Tang - Sun Simiao]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>For those who have long indulged in alcohol, there has never been an instance without developing thirst. Although great cold may freeze the sea, it does not freeze the alcohol; this demonstrates the inherently hot nature of alcohol, with nothing to add to it. Salty dried meats and roasted foods are flavors that drinkers crave, never leaving their lips. After three cups, self-control is lost. When drinking and eating with abandon, chewing sauces without discerning their acidity or saltiness, along with countless nights of indulgence, the three burners become intensely heated, and the five organs dry out. Even wood and stone may scorch; how can a person avoid thirst? Whether treated or not depends on the patient. If one can be diligent and cautious, healing may occur in a few months. However, if one does not take care, death will come swiftly. Medical texts contain many effective prescriptions; but what of those who do not exercise caution? The precautions are threefold: first, to avoid drinking; second, to be restrained in sexual activity; and third, to avoid salty foods and flour. Those who can heed these precautions may not need medicine to find relief. Those unaware of this, even with elixirs, cannot be saved. Reflect deeply and exercise caution! Also, for those suffering from thirst, whether healed or not, one must always consider the possibility of significant abscesses. Why? Because in individuals with thirst, abscesses often develop between the major joints, leading to sudden acute complications; thus, one should prepare abscess remedies in advance to prevent them.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>A person suffering from thirst due to illness began in spring. After taking medicine throughout the summer, they regained strength and the thirst gradually improved. However, urination remained frequent, exceeding twenty times a day and night, with each time amounting to three or four liters, and at its worst still not reducing below two liters. Over time, the frequency diminished, but the person gradually consumed rich and fatty foods, becoming increasingly emaciated. Their throat felt constricted, lips and mouth dried out, and they experienced shortness of breath, unable to speak much. They felt heat and irritation in the heart, with aching legs, and their appetite multiplied, hence the lack of energy. One should know that this illness arises from excessive heat in a deficient state. </p>
<p>Treatment: Long-term consumption of herbal juice can eliminate heat, while cow&#39;s milk and apricot cheese are good for replenishing, making this method most beneficial. Internal consumption-related illness is caused by heat. Urination exceeding drinking causes extreme depletion and shortness of breath. Internal consumption refers to the transformation of food into urine without triggering thirst. </p>
<p>In observing over ten years, the Governor of Zizhou, Li Wenbo, had long taken white stone as medicine. Suddenly, he experienced a strong desire for intercourse, and after a month, he gradually developed thirst. After several days, urination became excessive, reaching a hundred times a day. Despite various treatments, his condition worsened gradually; his body weakened to the point where he could not stand or stop, his spirits became disoriented, and his mouth and tongue dried out, leading to his demise. Though rare, this illness is quite formidable.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The pulse is weak and fine; taking wolfberry soup will have immediate effects, but it cannot provide a lasting cure. Taking lead pill powder will also reduce symptoms; during this time, one should take the heat-clearing and nourishing pills.  </p>
<p>For those with stronger illnesses, the stems grow long and thrive, yet the essence does not engage and discharges on its own. After experiencing thirst, sores and boils may form, all due to stone heat. In such cases, it is advisable to take pig kidney and jicama soup to resolve the kidney stone heat; one should also take white duck soup. </p>
<p>Many people indulge recklessly during their youth. At the height of their strength, they do not exercise caution or care, pursuing desires and pleasures to extremes; as they age slightly, their kidney energy becomes depleted, leading to the proliferation of various ailments. Additionally, young individuals who fear they cannot engage in sexual activity often take stone powders. When true energy is exhausted, stone energy becomes isolated, resulting in only waste; the lips and mouth become dry, essence leaks on its own, or urine is red and yellow, with hard and firm stools. There may be thirst accompanied by diarrhea, even up to a stone daily, or thirst without diarrhea, or diarrhea without thirst. Everything consumed seems to turn into urine, all of which results from excess in sexual conduct. For ordinary people, excessive thirst in summer is attributed to the heart&#39;s governance. When the heart rules and sweats, it leads to deficiency and dryness in the kidneys, hence the thirst and scant urine.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>In winter months, when there is no sweat, people tend to urinate more often. This is a sign of someone in good health, referred to as thirst for fluids. However, if one urinates frequently without drinking water, it indicates strong kidney function. The texts say: strong kidneys lead to urination. Thirst without the desire to drink water occurs in such cases. Therefore, those consuming stones will find urination frequent, as the nature of stones returns to the kidneys. When the kidneys are supported by stones, they can effectively metabolize fluids, hence the frequent urination; but when urination is excessive, the five organs do not receive adequate nourishment, leading to their decline and various illnesses. Zhang Zhongjing states: heat congestion in the middle jiao results in hardness, while heat congestion in the lower jiao leads to bloody urination. Moreover, heat congestion can cause dysuria and blockage, which should not excessively irritate frequent urination. If there is internal heat, the person will be thirsty; removing the heat will stop the thirst. Concurrent deficiency needs heat removal and replenishment to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>For anyone suffering from thirst for fluids for over a hundred days, cauterization or needling should not be done. Such treatments may cause pus from sores to not cease, leading to abscesses and eventually emaciation and death. Care must also be taken to avoid accidental harm, even small needle wounds. Any water consumed will turn into pus and exit through the sores. If urination does not cease, death is certain; thus, one must be cautious! At the initial stage of illness, treatments may be applied as prescribed, which is beneficial.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The Living Human Book (Song Dynasty, Zhu Gong)</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Thirst from Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>When asked about thirst: If the pulse is floating and there is thirst, it pertains to the Taiyang; if there is sweating and thirst, it pertains to the Yangming; if there is wind-cold and fever, or fever with aversion to wind and thirst, it pertains to the Shaoyang; if there is diarrhea and thirst, it pertains to the Shaoyin. </p>
<p>One must strictly avoid giving Baihu Decoction to those with Taiyang syndrome who have no sweat and are thirsty; for Yangming syndrome with much sweating and thirst, one should not give Wuling Powder. One asks: Then for Taiyang disease with thirst, can it ever be treated with Baihu? The reply: For Taiyang syndrome, after sweating, if the pulse is surging and there is thirst, then it can be given. One asks: For Yangming disease with thirst, can it ever be treated with Wuling? The reply: For Yangming syndrome with difficulty in urination, little sweating, floating pulse, and thirst, then it can be given. These are all subtle methods of Zhongjing.</p>
<p>In general, thirst must not be treated with water unless it is a severe thirst. If it is slight thirst with a dry throat, one should sip to moisten it, ensuring the stomach is balanced. If there is severe thirst with great agitation, and a person can drink a dou, then give them five sheng. If nothing is administered, the dryness will prevent sweating, leading to coughing and even death. Common people, seeing that drinking water alleviates slight thirst, often drink excessively, resulting in fullness and cough leading to death; this is very common. One should use Wuling Powder or Xianxiong Pill to treat this.</p>
<p>If the Yang poison is greatly intense, causing extreme thirst, then Heinu Pill is the main treatment. For those who suffer from heatstroke, who are persistently thirsty, use Jiu Zheng Huanglian Pill as the main treatment.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Xiaoke (Diabetes)</strong></p>
<p>The disease of Xiaoke arises from the Sanjiao (Three Jiao), manifesting as upper Xiaoke, middle Xiaoke, and kidney Xiaoke. Upper Xiaoke indicates disease in the upper Jiao, also known as diaphragm disease; it involves excessive thirst, significant water intake, and diminished food consumption, with normal bowel movements and possibly clear, copious urination, indicating dryness in the upper Jiao. Treatment should focus on moistening and relieving dryness.</p>
<p>Middle Xiaoke pertains to the stomach, characterized by thirst with excessive food and drink intake, and yellow urine. The classics state: &#39;Heat consumes the grains,&#39; indicating heat in the middle, thus it is necessary to purge. When one feels disinterested in food and drink, recovery occurs. </p>
<p>Kidney Xiaoke originates in the lower Jiao, initially presenting as a condition known as “gao lin” (mucous urination), where the output resembles oil. As the disease progresses, it leads to a dark complexion, emaciation, and oily, turbid urine. The treatment should focus on nourishing the blood to clarify, separating the clear from the turbid for self-healing.</p>
<p>The method states: dryness above leads to thirst; pungent and sweet flavors promote lung moistening, therefore, honey-boiled ginger soup can be administered generously, to sip occasionally. The method emphasizes: in heart and lung diseases, do not despise frequent small amounts of drink. The Inner Canon says: &#39;For supplementing the upper Jiao, treatment should be gentle.&#39; It also notes: &#39;Use pungent substances to moisten.&#39; Opening the pores facilitates the circulation of fluids, allowing lung qi to descend, hence reducing heat and dryness, ultimately quenching thirst.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noted: &#39;The two Yangs are bound and create the condition of Xiaoke.&#39; Wang’s commentary states: &#39;The two Yangs bind due to heat in the stomach and large intestine.&#39; When the intestines and stomach harbor heat, they can effectively process water and grains. Therefore, a sweet and pungent formula to remove heat may be used: one pound of Huanglian powder, one pound each of fresh Rehmannia glutinosa juice, fresh white lotus root juice, and cow’s milk, simmered into a paste; the Huanglian powder can be formed into pills the size of a wutong seed.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Take thirty pills each time, wash them down with a sip of warm water, and administer daily. Stop after ten doses if thirst due to illness arises. </p>
<p>To treat the upper burner with heat congestion leading to a lack of appetite and clear, abundant urination, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or add Bai Hu Decoction, or incorporate ingredients such as Di Gu Pi, Shao Yao, Huang Qi, Shi Gao, Huang Qin, and Jie Geng found in the Qian family formulas.</p>
<p>In cases of gastric congestion with heat and fullness, where one feels hungry but does not want to eat, or if the heat has turned into consumption leading to good appetite but weight loss, or due to severe dryness and heat causing thirst, with frequent urination, the excessive heat from the heart and dryness of the three burners impair the smooth flow of fluids, resulting in the body being deprived of moisture, leading to emaciation and a dry, heat-laden thirst. Even with much drinking, the fluids fail to penetrate the stomach and intestines, which cannot satisfy thirst, causing excessive urination. The common misunderstanding that this results from a deficiency and cold in the lower burner has misled many.</p>
<p>If cold from the heart affects the lungs, it leads to lung depletion, with reduced drinking and increased urination. One should nourish the lungs and calm the heart; if dead, it can still be treated, indicating that the heart and lungs are in conflict. </p>
<p>If heat from the heart affects the lungs, it is termed gastric consumption, whereby heart and gastric heat can lead to thirst through prolonged effects, treated by Mai Men Dong drink.</p>
<p>Excessive drinking, wind, or abundant sweating indicate that one should not wear single-layer clothing; if one eats and sweats profusely, resembling dripping liquid, and if not treated for a long time, it will result in consumption. Bai Zhu San is indicated for this.</p>
<p>Gastric congestion with heat and fullness, where one feels hungry but does not wish to eat, or where heat has become consumption, leading to good appetite but lean body, or severe dryness and heat causing thirst with frequent urination.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of the Three Dissolutions</strong></p>
<p>The Book of Changes states that from the vast void to the Yellow Springs, there are six positions in heaven and earth. The Inner Canon mentions that the human body has six positions from head to feet. Now I say there are also six positions in the chest and abdomen of a person, from the lungs to the kidneys. Humans are connected with heaven and earth, and the five elements, forged in the same crucible; knowing one leads to understanding the other. Therefore, the celestial energies are categorized as metal and fire, while the terrestrial energies are categorized as earth and water. The vital energies of humans are defined as wind and fire. Thus, when metal and fire combine, they create heat and clarity; when water and earth combine, they create humidity and coldness; when wind and fire combine, they create warmth and intensity. This is also true within the human chest and abdomen. </p>
<p>The lungs, being the highest, represent metal and govern dryness and clarity; the heart, next, represents fire and governs heat; the liver follows, representing wind and wood, which govern warmth; the gallbladder follows as well, representing fire and governing extreme heat; the spleen, following this, represents earth and humidity, governing coolness; and the kidneys, lastly positioned, correspond to the Yellow Springs and govern cold water. Therefore, the heart and lungs symbolize heaven, the spleen and kidneys symbolize earth, while the liver and gallbladder symbolize humanity. Those who do not understand this cannot be engaged in discussions about human ailments. </p>
<p>Earth is the foundation of all things, and water is the essence of all things. When water and earth combine in virtue, they dwell in the yin, residing below as the essence of the earth; all things take root in the earth, hence water and earth produce humidity and cold. If the yang becomes excessively dry and hot, then the energy of the earth fails to establish itself, and the roots of all things wither, leaving branches and leaves dry. The Great Treatise of the Five Constants states: “Those rooted in the center are referred to as the divine mechanism.”<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The essence of animals fundamentally lies in the center. The core comprises the spleen, stomach, and kidneys. When food enters the stomach, the spleen transforms it into qi and flavor, nourishing the five organ systems and all joints. Therefore, sour nourishes the liver to strengthen tendons, bitter nourishes the heart to enhance blood vessels, sweet nourishes the spleen for muscles, spicy nourishes the lungs for skin and hair, and salty nourishes the kidneys for bone marrow. The five qi operate similarly: clear qi nourishes the lungs, hot qi nourishes the heart, warm qi nourishes the liver, damp qi nourishes the spleen, and cold qi nourishes the kidneys. When any of these five flavors or five qi are excessive, illness occurs; if deficient, illness also arises; only in balance can there be stability. Thus, the theory of the six stages and organs states: the five flavors are ingested and stored in the intestines and stomach. Each flavor is stored to nurture the qi of the five organs; when qi is harmonious, it generates life, and bodily fluids are formed, allowing the spirit to arise. This is its principle. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the discussion of the Taiyin and Yangming states: why do the limbs become ineffective when the spleen is ill? Qibo replied: The limbs draw their qi from the stomach, yet cannot reach the channels. This is necessarily because they rely on the spleen and kidneys. Now, if the spleen is ill and unable to move the fluids from the stomach, it cannot derive qi from food and water. The spleen weakens daily, the channels are obstructed, and the muscles, bones, and tissues lack the qi for vitality, hence they become ineffective. The Emperor asked: Why does the spleen not govern the seasons? Qibo replied: The spleen corresponds to the earth, governing the center, and regularly interacts with the four seasons to nourish the five organs, each for eighteen days; it cannot exclusively govern at any one season. The spleen constantly relies on the essence of the stomach’s earth.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The earth is the source of all things and follows the principles of heaven and earth; therefore, from top to bottom, one cannot solely dominate time. The Emperor asked: &quot;The spleen and stomach are interconnected by membranes, yet how can they function to move their fluids?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The foot Taiyin, associated with the three Yin channels, has pulses that connect the stomach to the spleen and throat, thus the Taiyin facilitates the movement of Qi in the three Yin. The foot Yangming, as the exterior and the sea of the five organs and six bowels, also assists in the flow of Qi in the three Yang. The internal organs each draw in Qi through their channels to benefit Yangming, hence the stomach governs the flow of its fluids. The limbs do not draw from food and water, and as the Qi declines daily, the Yin pathways become obstructed, and the sinews, bones, and muscles lack Qi to grow, leading to their inactivity. Inactivity refers to being unable to perform their functions. From this, we see that the five organs and six bowels, as well as the limbs and bones, all rely on the spleen and stomach to circulate their fluids and mutually moisten and nourish each other. Later physicians, wishing to use drying and heating agents to nourish the spleen and stomach and invigorate the earth’s Qi, are misguided, aren&#39;t they? Moreover, for those suffering from thirst and hunger, their inherent damp and cold Yin Qi is already weak; adding excessive drying heat with medicinal herbs further depletes the Qi of the spleen and stomach. Some do not distinguish between the five organs’ and six bowels’ Qi in terms of deficiency and excess, and broadly classify heat as excess and cold as deficiency. They only recognize the heart&#39;s fire as Yang and its Qi as deficient or excessive, missing the nuances of the internal organs&#39; six Qi.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The lungs are fundamentally clear and when deficient, they become warm; the heart is fundamentally hot and when deficient, it becomes cold; the liver is fundamentally warm and when deficient, it becomes clear; the spleen is fundamentally damp and when deficient, it becomes dry; the kidneys are fundamentally cold and when deficient, they become hot. If the stomach is cold and deficient, it indicates a significant presence of cold yin fluids in the stomach and a frail yang fire, not that the earth element of the stomach is fundamentally weak. Therefore, one should warm and tonify the yang fire in the stomach to reduce the excessive cold yin fluids. Similarly, if the stomach is hot and in excess, it indicates a strong yang fire in the stomach and a deficiency of yin fluids, thus cold herbs should be used to drain the excess fire in the stomach while nourishing the deficient fluids. These methods address the excess and deficiency of yin and yang within the stomach, rather than the fundamental dampness of the stomach. The same applies to other organs. To address the dampness of the spleen and stomach, to moisten the dampness is to tonify it, and to dry the dampness is to drain it, as the earth element is inherently damp. </p>
<p>In all organs and systems, it is not necessary for the kidney water to solely manage cold or for the heart fire to solely manage heat; one must understand that each organ harmonizes its respective energies. I often say that the principle of the five elements is that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin; solitary yin does not thrive, and solitary yang cannot prevail. All things contain their counterparts, and the five elements support one another, which is called harmony; their interactions of overcoming and weakening represent decline and growth; chaos and disarray lead to afflictions. Therefore, when water is scarce and fire abundant, it signifies a strong yang and a weak yin, leading to heat diseases; conversely, when water is abundant and fire scarce, it signifies a strong yin and a weak yang, leading to cold diseases. Thus, the treatment involves draining excesses and tonifying deficiencies, aiming for balance.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Therefore, to treat diabetes, one should replenish the kidney&#39;s water and the deficiency of yin and cold, while draining the heart&#39;s fire and excess heat, eliminating excessive dryness and heat from the intestines and stomach. This helps to restore the body&#39;s fluids, preventing blockage in the pathways, allowing the fluids to flourish instead of drying up, ensuring the qi and blood are flowing without stagnation; thus, the illness will gradually disappear. Moreover, those with diabetes initially incur such conditions due to improper diet and medication, causing dryness and stagnation in the intestines and stomach, hindering the smooth distribution of qi and fluids, which may lead to mental disturbance, excessive imbalance, or result from major illnesses that diminish yin energy, weakening the blood and leading to excessive yang heat and dryness. </p>
<p>Hence, the three types of diabetes arise from a long-standing craving for salty foods, excessive intake of fried and roasted items, and heavy drinking. Some young people also consume pills made from metals and stones, which can accumulate and create internal heat, leading to a deficiency in the lower body. The blood and qi cannot regulate this heat; hence, the stomach becomes excessively dry, resulting in thirst and urging to drink. </p>
<p>If one drinks a lot and urinates frequently, it is called &quot;water diabetes&quot; (Xiao Ke); if one eats a lot but remains constantly hungry, with frequent urination and gradual weight loss, it is termed &quot;middle diabetes&quot; (Xiao Zhong); if one is thirsty and drinks continuously, with thin legs and oily urine, it is referred to as &quot;kidney diabetes&quot; (Shen Xiao). These three types are essentially caused by dryness and heat, with variations in severity. </p>
<p>I have heard that many people universally treat these three types of diabetes with the same approach because they are good at persisting through food but are troubled by thirst. However, discussions about diabetes often overlook the fundamental causes.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The discourse states that in cases of thirst, the upper part is truly hot while the lower part is cold and vacuous. The upper heat leads to excessive thirst and drinking, while the lower cold results in frequent urination. This is fundamentally due to the deficiency of the kidney water in the lower region, which cannot control the heart fire in the upper region; hence, the upper is truly hot while the lower is vacuous and cold. </p>
<p>It is also said that water is the foundation of all things and precedes the five elements, hence kidney water is the source of human vitality and should not be allowed to weaken. If the root is not firm, the branches and leaves will not flourish; if the vital essence is not solid, the body will not thrive. </p>
<p>In cases of thirst, the lower kidney water is extremely cold. If cold drugs are taken further, the vital essence will turnEmpty, and the kidney water will weaken, leading to an exacerbation of the upper heart fire, making it difficult to treat. The correct approach is to use warming medicines to nourish the vital essence. If the lower kidney water becomes strong enough to subdue the upper heart fire, then naturally thirst will cease, urination will return to normal, and the condition will improve. </p>
<p>Such statements contradict those of Zhong Jing and are what is referred to as clever words that seem plausible but violate the actual principles. This is not merely a misunderstanding of today; it has been a long-standing error. </p>
<p>Additionally, in Jiang&#39;s &quot;Pharmaceutical Evidence&quot; discussing the pathology of thirst and kidney diseases, it is stated: &quot;The three burners and five organs are all suffer from hyperactivity, yet only the bladder is cold like ice.&quot; It further states: &quot;The lower back kidney is increasingly cold.&quot; It reiterates that the bladder and kidney are as cold as a spring. Initially, it describes the three burners and five organs as all having a hyperactive state, yet the bladder alone is cold like ice. Then it states that the five organs are also cold and the kidney water is cold, suggesting a state of emptiness, while the remaining heat is described as similarly vacuous.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The rise and fall of yin and yang, how can this be reasoned? Moreover, their statements do not correspond, and their errors are minor; but regarding the differences between cold and heat, using opposing treatments is the greatest mistake of all. Some say that the kidneys and bladder belong to water; when they are deficient, they cannot control fire. If they cannot control fire, then those with frequent urination are far from recovery. They assert that when the water essence is abundant, it can control fire, but if it is deficient, it cannot control fire. Hence, when yang is abundant and yin is deficient, it causes dryness and heats the liquids, resulting in scanty urination; while when yin is abundant and yang is deficient, it cannot control water, leading to frequent urination. Yet, those who are thirsty and have frequent urination do not realize this. Why is that? It is because excessive dryness and heat cause the Sān Jiāo (Triple Burner) and the intestines and stomach to become affected, leading to blockages that prevent water and liquid from seeping out and nourishing the hundred bones. Therefore, outside the intestines and stomach, the excessive dryness and heat, even with much intake, ultimately cannot moisten the exterior, resulting in unceasing thirst. Those with frequent urination, due to excessive intake, cannot disperse liquid outside of the intestines and stomach, hence they urinate frequently. Thus, in the classic &quot;Yuán Bìng Shì,&quot; it states: the sweat pores of the skin refer to the openings that release sweat; the gas gates refer to the portals that release qi; the channels refer to the paths and patterns of qi and liquid; the ghost gates refer to the entrance to the netherworld; the original hall refers to the abode of the essence. And yet, the original hall contains all.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The human body&#39;s organs, skin, muscles, fascia, bone marrow, nails, and teeth, as well as all things, are interconnected through pathways of entry and exit, ascending and descending. Thus, it is stated in the classics: if entry and exit are hindered, the spirit’s mechanisms will perish; if ascending and descending cease, the energy will stand isolated and perilous. Therefore, without entry and exit, there can be no growth, maturation, aging; without ascending and descending, there can be no transformation and storage. It is understood that entry and exit, ascending and descending, exist in all things. Hence, the human faculties of sight, hearing, smell, taste, body, mind, and consciousness, which can be utilized, function due to the unobstructed flow of these movements; if blocked, they cannot function. If the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear, the nose cannot detect fragrance, the tongue cannot taste, the muscles weaken, bones ache, nails recede, teeth decay, hair falls out, skin loses sensation, and the intestines and stomach cannot excrete fluids, all result from a stagnation of heat, an obstruction of the vital center, preventing fluids and blood pathways from ascending, descending, and flowing. Each condition varies in severity, producing different ailments. If the ailment is superficial, it results in stagnation; the pores become tightly closed, preventing the yang energy from dispersing, leading to dryness without sweat and inability for Qi and fluids to emerge. The unlearned do not recognize this, thus observing frequent thirst and urination, mistakenly attributing it to cold in the lower parts. Little do they realize that heat and stagnation in the intestines and stomach cause this. I present this to illustrate that thirst is essentially due to stagnation and blockage of the pathways of excretion in the intestines and stomach: although water enters the intestines and stomach, it cannot be released outward, resulting in frequent urination and subsequent thirst. This explanation suffices to elucidate the matter. One can refer to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; for all discussions about thirst and clarify the principle thoroughly.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>There are those who say that thirst arises from heart and lung Qi stagnation, some who say it comes from liver blockage, some who say it is due to spleen heat, and others who attribute it to kidney heat. Some mention thirst arising from heat accumulation in the stomach and large intestine, while others speak of thirst from intestinal blockage. There are also cases of thirst due to small intestine heat, thirst caused by disease-induced fevers, and thirst arising from indulgence in rich food and drink. Additionally, there are those who experience thirst after excessive drinking or from fatigue caused by long journeys in the heat, as well as thirst from damage to the stomach and thirst from kidney heat or from illness-induced wind. Despite the different parts of the five organs and the various ailments encountered, they all ultimately return to the commonality of dryness and heat.</p>
<p>Regarding thirst from heart and lung Qi stagnation, it is said that heat from the heart moves to the lungs, leading to diaphragm heat. The note explains that prolonged heat transfer from the heart to the lungs results in diaphragmatic heat and excessive thirst with much drinking. Concerning liver blockage and thirst, it is noted that patients with liver blockage are easily startled while sleeping, have excessive thirst, and urinate frequently. As for thirst due to spleen heat, it is stated that when the spleen&#39;s Qi is hot, the stomach dries out and thirst arises, leading to muscle weakness and potential muscle wasting. Regarding thirst from kidney heat, it is noted that kidney heat conditions first exhibit pain and soreness in the lower back, followed by severe thirst and frequent drinking, along with overall body heat. The discussion also mentions that the Shaoyin meridian connects to the kidneys, branches to the lungs, and is linked to the root of the tongue, thus causing dry mouth, dry tongue, and thirst.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Uncle Shi stated that kidney deficiency cannot control heart fire, leading to excess heat above and deficiency and coldness below. Using warm herbs to tonify kidney water in order to overcome heart fire reveals an unclear understanding of the principles of yin and yang and deficiency and excess. Kidney water belongs to yin and is inherently cold; when deficient, it becomes heat. Heart fire belongs to yang and is inherently hot; when deficient, it becomes cold. If kidney water is deficient and yin is weak, this results in real yang heat of heart fire, which is described as yang being strong while yin is weak, thus both upper and lower regions are full of heat. Therefore, the Treatise on Stagnation of Qi states: when kidney qi is weak, yang qi prevails. The Manifestation of the Five Qi Theory states: the kidney despises dryness, for from dryness, the kidney becomes depleted and the water dries up. The Discussion on Organ Qi states: the kidney suffers from dryness, and one should urgently consume warm and moistening foods. Cold substances belong to yin and can nourish water while draining heart fire; hot substances belong to yang and can nourish fire while depleting water. If kidney water is already unable to contend with heart fire, leading to heat both above and below, how can one use warm herbs to nourish kidney water in the hope of overcoming heart fire? Is this not misguided? Similarly, when the stomach and large intestine are hotly bound and produce thirst, the discussion of yin and yang states: when both yangs bind, it leads to exhaustion. The note clarifies: both yangs binding indicates heat binding in both the stomach and large intestine. Heat in the intestines and stomach can effectively digest food and water. Additionally, the Treatise on Stagnation of Qi states: the large intestine transfers heat to the stomach, making one able to eat yet become thin. The Essentials of Pulsology states: when the pulse entails coalescing into exhaustion, one can eat yet remain thin. If thirst arises from intestinal obstruction, frequent drinking does not lead to fulfillment, causing shortness of breath and restlessness, with intermittent diarrhea. If one frequently drinks without satisfaction, their bowel movements must inevitably be unstable.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>If one suffers from excessive thirst, drinks frequently, and has abundant urination, it is evidently due to dryness and heat accumulating in the Sanjiao (Three Burners) and a decline of Qi. How can one use drying and heating poisons to enhance Yang and combat the deficiency of Yin? This is truly a mistake of confusing the real with the false. Thirst often leads to conditions like deafness, blindness, sores, abscesses, and acne, all stemming from dryness and heat in the intestines and stomach, preventing fluid from moisturizing the body. If the heat is severe and results in the bladder being obstructed, it cannot excrete fluids properly, causing water to leak and swelling in the face.</p>
<p>For those who experience thirst due to damp-heat in the small intestine, it is remarked that when heat and Qi are retained there, pain in the intestines arises, and the heat causes thirst, leading to difficulty in urination. It is noted that heat dries up liquids, hence making the urine hard. In the case of thirst due to malaria, it is said: &quot;When Yang is strong, there is external heat; when Yin is deficient, there is internal heat. If both internal and external heat exist, there will be panting and thirst, leading to the desire for cold drinks.&quot; Thus, with strong Yang and deficient Yin resulting in pathogenic heat, one should use cooling medicines to nourish Yin and drain Yang. This is called the way of draining the excess and supplementing the deficiency.</p>
<p>If thirst arises from rich and sweet foods, it is a peculiar illness. The question arises: What is the name of the illness caused by a sweet mouth? Qi Bo says: &quot;This is due to an overflow of the five Qi. The name of the illness is Spleen Dampness.&quot; Dampness is heat; if the spleen is hot, it cannot nourish the four organs, causing Qi to overflow. This condition arises because of spleen heat, thus it is called Spleen Dampness. The classics say: &quot;When the five flavors enter and are stored in the stomach, the spleen circulates their essence and Qi. The fluids in the spleen make the mouth sweet; this is produced by richness and beauty, hence one must frequently consume sweet and rich foods.&quot;<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The obese generate internal heat, while sweet foods lead to fullness; hence their vital energy overflows upwards, resulting in thirst. The comprehensive discussion on deficiency and excess states: wasting and weakness, fullness causing nausea, obesity contributes to diseases related to rich foods. Some say the stomach&#39;s vitality is fundamental, while the spleen and stomach together form the internal and external; the spleen and stomach, representing the central region, should receive warmth and nourishment to adjust diet. Nowadays, those suffering from thirst have extreme deficiency in the spleen and stomach, hence should be warmed and nourished. If cold medicines are taken, they will deplete the spleen and stomach, making the original vital energy deficient and difficult to treat. This reflects a misunderstanding of the principles of yin and yang, cold and heat, deficiency and excess, leading to reckless statements without fear. Do they not know that the treatise on the abdomen states: The emperor said: The master frequently speaks of &#39;heat in the middle&#39; and &#39;thirst in the middle&#39;, one should not take fragrant herbs or stone medicines. Stone medicines cause mania, and fragrant herbs provoke madness. The annotations explain: Excessive drinking and urination is termed &#39;heat in the middle&#39;; excessive eating and urination is &#39;thirst in the middle&#39;. Rejoicing excessively leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Fragrant tastes good, while stone refers to the milk of jade, which is heat-inducing medicine. The scripture also states: &#39;Heat in the middle&#39; and &#39;thirst in the middle&#39; refers to the wealthy. Now to forbid rich foods disregards their desires, and forbidding fragrant herbs and stone medicines prevents healing—one wishes to understand this reasoning. Qi Bo said: Fragrant herbs have a delightful taste, stone medicines have a harsh taste; both possess urgent and forceful energies, thus only those with a calm heart can consume these two. The emperor asked: Why is that? Qi Bo answered: The heat energy is strong and fierce, and the energies of these medicines are likewise. So-called &#39;drink once, urinate twice&#39; refers to the lung energy expelling water; when the sea of water and grain is exhausted, it leads to thirst. Generally, when one sees thirst, hastily prescribing heat medicines has misled many.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Therefore, the Inner Canon states that thirst manifests in this way, is it not clear? Yet, there are still those who are confused; they believe that excessive qi can lead to a reversal in triumph, which is why many people err. This is similar to yang reaching its peak and resembling yin. If one does not clearly distinguish the root from its manifestations, misunderstanding will ensue. Thus, whenever one feels coolness in the lower body and knees feel like ice, this indicates that heart fire is not descending, appearing like cold water. Cold herbs should be administered to purge it; after three to five doses, the fire will decrease and water will rise, and the cold will naturally recede. However, the world collectively clings to delusion, treating the Classic of Spirituality and the Classic of Suwen as discarded remnants, which is truly lamentable! Therefore, when addressing these conditions, one must clearly understand the root and manifestations of the disease, grasp the capabilities of the medicine, and know where to regulate the qi without causing harm, and thus one can formulate a prescription. The so-called root and manifestations refer to the primary disease as the root and its secondary manifestations as the sign; this relates to the transmission of disease&#39;s essentials. One should first assist in urgent situations. It is also said that the six qi are the root and the three yin and three yang are the manifestations; this particularly pertains to the urgent cases of organ diseases. It is further noted that the six qi refer to the stomach&#39;s root; if the stomach is hot, then the stomach is the manifestation and heat is the root. When addressing the prescription, one must eliminate the heat within the stomach, which treats the root. Thus, among the six qi, the severe ones are considered the evil, and the weaker ones as the correct; therefore, the practice should be to drain the excessive and tonify the deficient, with balance as the goal. Nourishing the righteous and eliminating the evil is the way of heaven. Generally, in treating diseases, knowing the root and manifestations and applying the appropriate methods, why must one scheme with the masses? In the discourse on yin and yang, it is said: be cautious and thoroughly understand yin and yang, and do not conspire with the many.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The Treatise on Symptoms and Pathogens states: To know the symptoms and the root cause is to ensure accuracy in every action; to be unaware of the symptoms and the root is to act recklessly. The Great Discussion on Essential Truths states: To know the symptoms and the root causes, applying this knowledge, is without danger. To clearly understand opposites and comply properly leads to no errors. Those who are unaware of this cannot effectively discuss diagnosis and are merely capable of confusing the principles. Hence, it is said: Rough practitioners, jovial and overconfident, think they know, proclaim the heat has not yet receded, and the cold illness re-emerges; similar symptoms in different manifestations mislead diagnosis and confuse the principles—this is what is meant. The principle of symptoms and root causes is fundamental yet extensive; though small, it encompasses the great and allows one to understand many from just one. Discussing symptoms and root is simple yet undiminished; examining the root and symptoms allows for the adjustment of the vital energy. Clearly understanding reversals serves everyone, fulfilling the Way of Heaven. The Great Discussion on the Origins of Heaven states: When the numbers reach their extremes and the principles are without confusion, it is indeed clarity. The so-called skillful use of medicine differentiates warmth and coolness, opposing cold and heat, dryness and wetness, which has been previously mentioned—this pertains to vital energy. As for the skillful use of flavors, for example, sour can contract, sweet can ease, pungent can disperse, bitter can solidify, and salty can soften—sour pertains to wood. Dryness, governed by metal, disperses while wood counters it; earth and dampness are characterized by ease, with water overcoming it, thus it can be so. Bitter can dry and solidify, and fire is associated with bitterness. The Book of Changes states: Nothing excels fire in nourishing all things. Generally, things that are dry are solid. Sweet can ease urgency and disperse blockages; sweet pertains to earth. Dryness can create sudden blockages; therefore, easing leads to urgency in dispersing blockages. Pungent can disperse and suppress blockages while moistening dryness; pungent pertains to metal.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>When gold is scattered, it generates water. Moreover, when it comes to binding and scattering, the essence and fluids circulate, leading to the generation of moisture. The theory of organ dynamics states that the kidneys suffer from dryness, hence one should urgently consume pungent foods to moisten them. Opening the pores ensures the flow of fluids and qi. Salty substances can soften hardness; salt represents water, which is moist and soft, thus overcoming the hardness of fire. This relates to the flavors associated with the five organs. The essence of these five flavors is blandness. Blandness is the flavor of the stomach, which is associated with earth. Earth is the foundation of all things, and the stomach is the foundation of the body. The &quot;Tian Yuan Ji Da Lun&quot; states that in the earth, transformation occurs, producing the five flavors; hence the fundamental flavor of the five tastes is bland, to correspond with the stomach&#39;s earth element. Blandness can penetrate and stimulate the channels. Dryness can lead to urgent binding, while sweetness can alleviate it. Blandness represents solid earth, which can greatly moisten dryness, ease urgent binding, allow qi to flow, and thus facilitate the seepage of bodily fluids. Therefore, for those suffering from excessive thirst, both medicine and food should be light. The &quot;Zhen Zhen Yao Da Lun&quot; states: pungent and sweet flavors promote dispersion (yang), sour and bitter flavors promote elimination (yin); salty flavor promotes elimination (yin), while bland flavor promotes seepage (yang). The six flavors can either disperse or consolidate, be slow or fast, dry or moist, hard or soft, which serve to benefit and regulate qi. The &quot;Ben Cao&quot; states: there are three grades of medicine: the superior grade is the sovereign, which primarily nourishes life, with minor toxicity to correspond with heaven; the middle grade is the minister, which primarily nourishes nature, with regular toxicity to correspond with humanity; the inferior grade is the assistant, which primarily treats illness, with major toxicity to correspond with the earth. Things not classified into these three grades are toxic substances.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>All these roles of rulers, ministers, assistants, and envoys serve to clarify the good and bad of medicines. The path of treatment is that the one who governs the sick is the ruler, the one who assists the ruler is the minister, and the one who responds to the minister&#39;s needs is the assistant. According to the root of the illness, there are rules of rulers, ministers, assistants, and envoys, as well as their corresponding oddity, size, and positions. This clarifies the seasonal and political conditions concerning the ruler and ministers, as well as the oppositions and alignments, and the main treatment method that should be applied according to the illness. The therapeutic methods are varied, and those skilled in their applications are considered good practitioners. Cold conditions should be treated with heat, hot conditions with cold, warm should be cleared, clear should be warmed, congealed should be dispersed, dispersed should be consolidated, mild conditions should be countered and controlled, severe conditions should be followed and alleviated, dry should be moistened, damp should be dried, hard should be softened, soft should be hardened, urgent should be eased, foreign elements should be eliminated, that which lingers should be removed, overworked should be warmed, those who are idle should move, those disturbed should be calmed, deficiencies should be replenished, severe cases should be purged, vomiting should be remedied by purging, friction should enhance the condition, thinning should reduce illness, opening should promote release, moxibustion should control, appropriately utilized according to individual needs, ensuring clarity and cleanliness, so that the pathogenic energies diminish, the organs harmonize, and return to their original state—this is the essence of proper treatment. The discussion on yin and yang states that if treatment does not follow the principles of heaven and fails to understand the laws of the earth, disasters will arise. Furthermore, the discussion on the six seasonal organs states that if one does not recognize the aging process and the depletion of qi, one cannot achieve success.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Ming Theory [Jin, Cheng Wujì]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Syndrome of Thirst in Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>How do we understand the thirst in febrile diseases? Thirst indicates internal heat. When the pathogen of febrile disease transmits from the exterior to the interior, there will inevitably be identifiable symptoms that appear according to the severity of the pathogen. Although it is said that on the first day it is in the skin, on the second day in the flesh, on the third day in the muscles, on the fourth day in the chest, on the fifth day in the abdomen, and on the sixth day entering the stomach, those that transmit through the meridians also manifest with symptoms.</p>
<p>The Taiyang primarily governs Qi and is the first to be affected by the pathogen. On the first or second day, if there is headache and rigidity of the waist and spine, this is indicative. When Taiyang transmits to Yangming, on the second or third day there will be fever, eye pain, and nasal dryness, making it difficult to lie down. When Yangming transmits to Shaoyang, on the third or fourth day there will be pain in the chest and ribs, and deafness in the ears. These three Yang meridians are affected by disease; the pathogen is still on the surface and has not yet caused heat, hence there is no thirst.</p>
<p>By the fourth or fifth day, as Shaoyang transmits to Taiyin, the pathogenic influence gradually enters the interior, and cold evil begins to transform into heat. At this time, the body fluids are depleted, leading to abdominal fullness and throat dryness. By the fifth or sixth day, as Taiyin transmits to Shaoyin, the internal heat becomes progressively deeper. At this time, the body fluids are attacked by the heat, gradually consumed and dried up, resulting in dry mouth, dry tongue, and thirst. By the sixth or seventh day, the Shaoyin pathogen transmits to Jueyin, and the illness in Jueyin is characterized by excessive thirst, indicating that the internal heat has reached its limit. The so-called excessive thirst means that there is an abundance of drinking water but little urination, signifying that the heat can consume the water.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Therefore, when the disease of typhoid reaches six or seven days and the patient feels thirsty and wants to drink water, this is a sign of the body’s desire to recover, as the transmission of the pathogen has progressed. Thus, it is said in the diagnosis of Jueyin disease: if the patient is thirsty and wants to drink water, a little should be given to help recovery. When the evil qi first enters the body, the heat is still dispersed and has not yet consolidated into real heat; it pervades and harms the stomach, consuming bodily fluids and resulting in thirst. Although the patient is thirsty and wishes to drink, one should not give them too much. If too much water is consumed, the heat cannot be dispelled, leading to further complications. The classic states: whenever one suffers from seasonal illnesses, if thirsty by the fifth or sixth day, do not give them a lot to drink. Why? Because the heat in the abdomen is still slight and cannot be dispelled, doing so might exacerbate the condition. If there is great thirst and a strong desire for water, one should still treat according to the symptoms, but provide only what is insufficient; do not overindulge. It is said that one can drink a dou (10 liters) or five sheng (around 1.5 liters); again, if thirsty and wanting water, a little should be offered, and methods should be used to alleviate the situation. For thirsting patients, Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) is recommended. If the thirst is extreme and they wish to drink several sheng, Baihu Decoction with ginseng is the principal remedy, all aiming to moisten dryness and generate bodily fluids. In general, if a patient is capable of drinking, this indicates a desire for recovery; however, those who do not understand the illness mistakenly believe that drinking will bring healing. For those with a slight thirst, when forcefully given water, it can lead to significant disasters that cannot be remedied. Symptoms such as palpitations, chest fullness, difficulty breathing, coughs, choking, dry retching, abdominal distension, and frequent diarrhea or difficulty urinating are all due to excessive drinking harming the body. Practitioners of diagnosis must be aware of this to avoid errors.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis of Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>The illness of diabetes is caused by the Three Jiao (the Triple Warmer system). There are three types: Upper diabetes, Middle diabetes, and Kidney diabetes. </p>
<p>Upper diabetes involves the lungs, characterized by excessive thirst with little appetite, normal bowel movements, and clear, voluminous urination. If dryness resides in the Upper Jiao, treatment should aim to moisten and alleviate the dryness.</p>
<p>Middle diabetes relates to the stomach, with thirst and increased food intake, characterized by reddish-yellow urination and heat that can consume grains. If the heat resides in the Middle Jiao, it should be purged.</p>
<p>Kidney diabetes initially manifests as a type of painful urination resembling oil. As the illness progresses, the face becomes dark, the body thin, with ears hot, and turbid urination containing oily substances. The treatment should focus on nourishing the blood to clarify and separate the clear from the turbid for self-recovery.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Duty to Parents</strong><br><em>By Zhang Congzheng in the Yuan Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>Three Consumptions Should Follow the Fire’s Dispersal</strong></p>
<p>Among the Eight Trigrams, only Li can illuminate things; among the Five Elements, only Fire can burn things; among the Six Energies, only Fire can eliminate things. Therefore, the utility of Fire is such that when wood is burned, it is transformed into charcoal; when earth is burned, it is transformed into dragon&#39;s liver; when metal is refined, it is transformed into juice; when stone is calcined, it is transformed into ash; when water is boiled, it is transformed into broth; when the sea is distilled, it is transformed into salt; when mercury is dried, it turns into powder; when tin is smelted, it is transformed into vermilion. Thus, the marsh&#39;s runoff dries under the blazing sun; the water in the cauldron evaporates under strong fire. The Five Organs: the heart represents the sovereign Fire&#39;s proper transformation, and the kidneys represent the sovereign Fire&#39;s opposing transformation; the Triple Burner represents the ministerial Fire’s proper transformation, and the gallbladder represents the ministerial Fire’s opposing transformation. When balance is achieved, food can be prepared and waste removed; when balance is lost, it burns and scorches the organs, leading to depletion of bodily fluids. Hence, anything that enters water flourishes; anything that enters fire perishes. The fire of the heart within the body dominates the upper part, leading to the elimination of layers; it dominates the middle, affecting the intestines and stomach; it dominates the lower part affecting bodily fluids; and it dominates the exterior affecting the muscles.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If excessive heat goes unchecked upwards, it affects the lungs; if it goes unchecked in the middle, it affects the spleen; if it goes unchecked downwards, it affects the liver and kidneys; if it goes unchecked externally, it affects the sinews and bones. When all four organs are completely depleted, the heart will begin to burn and perish. Therefore, the &quot;Suwen&quot; mentions various types of consumption: consuming deficiency, middle consumption, thirst consumption, wind consumption, phlegm consumption, and lung consumption. The symptoms of consumption differ, but they all point to a common underlying fire. Thus, consuming deficiency is a general term for various consumptions; middle consumption refers to the state of being excessively hungry; thirst consumption refers to the state of being excessively thirsty. However, wind consumption, phlegm consumption, and lung consumption should not be confused. Wind consumption is a disease of the two Yangs. The two Yangs refer to the Yangming, which is the stomach and large intestine. If the heart is affected, the blood does not flow, leading to women being unable to have their monthly cycle; if the spleen is affected, flavors do not transform, causing men to have low vitality, both unable to engage in matters of hidden fulfillment. When heat is trapped internally and persists, it stirs up wind that depletes the intestines and stomach, resulting in dry mouth. Even when drinking water, one cannot swallow; this is the rejection of wind-heat at the entrance of the stomach. The mouth is the upper source of disease, hence the illness manifests as such. Moreover, it is stated that the binding of the two Yangs is called consumption, and this consumption refers to the depletion of the intestines and stomach. Those who eat well yet remain thin are referred to as &quot;food deficiency,&quot; and this consumption is the depletion of muscle.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The condition known as &quot;Ge Xiao&quot; arises when heat from the heart is transferred to the lungs, leading to what is termed &quot;Ge Xiao.&quot; Wang Taifu states: Between the heart and lungs lies the oblique diaphragm, which connects with the horizontal diaphragm below. Therefore, when heat from the heart moves to the lungs and over time transforms, it becomes an internal heat of the diaphragm. In cases of excessive thirst, even when there is significant drinking, this is due to the lung&#39;s metal element being affected by the heart&#39;s fire evil; however, it is still only &quot;Ge Xiao,&quot; not reaching the lungs themselves. Hence, even drinking large amounts of water cannot quench the thirst. The symptoms include excessive drinking and frequent urination, or in some cases, not urinating frequently and developing edema, all of which stem from this condition. This is the &quot;Xiao&quot; related to the diaphragm. &quot;Lung Xiao,&quot; on the other hand, occurs when cold from the heart affects the lungs, which govern air. The classics say: food and drink enter the stomach, overflowing with vital essence, and are then transferred to the spleen; the spleen&#39;s essence returns to the lungs, connecting and regulating the water pathways, which then disperse to the bladder. The essential fluids spread throughout the four directions, with the five channels operating harmoniously to maintain normalcy. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; also mentions: the upper burner is like mist, the middle burner like bubbling, and the lower burner like a drain.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Now the heart is like fire, initially affected by Yang pathogens. The Yang fire becomes stagnant internally, spreading the heat within. The lungs, associated with metal, are restrained, and both fire and cold pathogens invade them. Externally, the lungs are weakened by cold, while internally they are dried out by fire. The extreme heat leads to a return of water flow, causing the skin to feel dry and tense, resulting in scorching heat in urination and frequent need to relieve oneself. Thus, it is said that drinking leads to urination and death. If the diaphragm is not assailed by cold, the Yang energy can disperse outward, making treatment possible. However, if the lungs are affected by cold, the Yang energy collapses internally, and treatment is unfeasible. This condition pertains to the consumption affecting the lungs. </p>
<p>If the Spleen Wind transmits to the kidneys, it is called hernia or masses. The lower abdomen becomes resentfully hot and painful, leading to the discharge of white fluid, known as &quot;gu&quot;. Wang Taifu stated: the consumption consumes fat and flesh like worms eroding away, gradually reducing them; this consumption refers to the depletion of the essence. Therefore, later scholars discuss the three burnings referring to kidney consumption, which might still be treatable, or else the person will develop complications, and without intervention, death is inevitable. This consumption directly affects the kidneys. </p>
<p>Consumption inevitably leads to thirst, which has three types: thirst for sweetness, thirst for stones, and thirst from dryness of fire. Those with much fat lead to internal heat; sweet foods lead to fullness, causing the Qi to overflow, converting to excessive thirst. The classics also say: rich tastes generate heat. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; further states: salty flavor moves the blood; consuming it in abundance leads to thirst. When salt enters the stomach, the Qi ascends through the middle jiao, directing to the lungs, where the blood Qi flows with it. The blood interacts with salt, thickening and becoming dry, which induces thirst. The blood vessels are the pathway of the middle jiao. All of this pertains to the thirst from rich and sweet items.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The essence of stone medicine is fierce and tends to generate heat. When it encounters heat, it inevitably injures the spleen. This is the thirst brought about by stone medicine. Yangming governs the heavens, corresponding with the four energies, leading to dryness in the throat and a craving for drinks. This occurs because the heart fire is restrained by cold water. Shaoyang governs the heavens, corresponding with the three energies; when summer heat arrives, people suffer from thirst. Taiyang governs the heavens, and when it becomes severe, there is excessive thirst and desire to drink, resulting from the flow of water obstructing fire, which causes the fiery energy to be constrained. Upon recovery from Shaoyin, there is thirst and a desire to drink, while recovery from Shaoyang leads to a throat that feels scorched and dry, prompting a craving for drinks, and a change in color to yellowish-red. After suffering from cold for five days, if afflicted by Shaoyin, one experiences dryness of the mouth, a dry tongue, and thirst. Those with kidney heat disease experience severe thirst and frequent drinking. All of these are instances of dryness and heat leading to thirst. Thus, individuals who consume rich foods tend to experience thirst from rich and sweet foods, as well as from stone medicines; those engaged in strenuous activities often experience thirst from dryness and heat. Although these two types differ, they are fundamentally the same. Therefore, when fire is concentrated above, there is strong thirst; when it is in the middle, it enhances digestion and causes hunger; when it is both in the upper and middle sections, there is the tendency for thirst, increased drinking, and frequent urination; when it is primarily in the middle and lower sections, there is no thirst but clear urination; and when it is spread throughout the upper, middle, and lower sections, there is increased drinking and frequent urination. This outlines their distinctions. Later generations attributed excessive thirst to kidney deficiency, which results from water being unable to overcome fire.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Why is this medicine inappropriate? The Eight Flavor Pill treats thirst, yet it does not produce water and instead promotes fire. Such individuals are fundamentally ignorant of the texts, carelessly quoting the annotations of Wang Taifu, increasing the source of fire to extinguish the yin shadow, and bolstering the water element to control the yang light. However, they only enhance the heart&#39;s yang, allowing cold and heat to flow freely, and strengthen the kidney&#39;s yin—heat may work, but do they understand that Wang Taifu&#39;s intention was to balance cold and heat? The kidneys inherently dislike dryness; can fire be added to them? Nowadays, Liu Hejian personally formulates the Shenqiong Pill, incorporating bitter Huangqin to enter the heart, using Qianqiu and Dahuang to drive heat downward, and Shiwei to draw it into the kidney pathway. This formula regards Qianqiu and Shiwei as the monarch, with Dahuang and Huangqin as ministers, and Chuanxiong, Lian, and Bohe as envoys, aiming to separate what is above from what is below—this embodies the secret meaning of the Huang Court. Additionally, by using Ren Shen, Bai Zhu Decoction, Xiaopi Pill, Da Ren Shen Powder, Biyu, and Jisus Powder in various methods to adjust, it thus effectively treats thirst. In the past, there was a person with great thirst who drank several liters daily. A master used a basin of natural ginger juice, placed it in a sealed room with a container, and had the person enter, then locked the door. When the patient felt extreme thirst, they had no choice but to drink the juice entirely, and their thirst diminished. This illustrates the intent of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; in moistening.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>In the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; the treatment for thirst involves using orchids to eliminate stagnant qi, which is also a mild remedy. Although the teacher&#39;s formula includes this single ingredient, there must be additional herbs to aid it. Initially, Yu Shi stated: When dealing with thirst-related illnesses that have not yet developed sores, one should use cold laxatives like rhubarb to facilitate the body’s recovery from great fatigue and weakness, similar to how sores may release pus and blood leading to diarrhea; this is indeed a common saying. Hence, the governor of Ba County claimed that Sanhuang Pills could treat thirst. In my own experience, after several years without improvement, I removed (stone salt) and nitrate, then added one pound of Coptis to create a large potion, brewing it vigorously for five to seven boils, allowing it to cool, and drinking it in hundreds of sips over several days. Alternately, I used Gui Ling Gan Lu Powder, Bai Hu Decoction, fresh lotus stem juice, light bamboo juice, and raw Rehmannia juice in a staggered manner, producing a large quantity to replace drinking water, and soon achieved recovery. Therefore, for the symptom of thirst, with balanced treatment without excessive purging, it results in slight moisture. A slight moistening ultimately cannot quell the heat rising; if purging is conducted without balance, it leads to continual drinking and dissipation, never truly nourishing the dryness of the diaphragm. Purging, balancing, and not diminishing flavors, without abstaining from desires or regulating emotions—if the illness recurs after recovery, if one can address these three aspects, thirst will not be a major concern.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Furthermore, the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that a slippery heart pulse indicates good thirst; it also says that a slippery pulse signifies predominant Yang energy. It mentions that when the heart pulse is faint, it signifies consumption, and that fragile heart pulses in the five organs likewise indicate consumption. It describes those with consumption as having thin skin yet firm flesh, tall and upright, with a strong heart. Those who are strong often have anger; when anger arises, Qi reverses upward, accumulating in the chest, and the blood and Qi flow back to the skin, filling the muscles, causing the pulse to stagnate, thus transforming into heat. This heat then consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. It also states that if all five organs are soft and weak, they are predisposed to consumption. Softness and weakness must coexist with strength; strength often leads to anger, and softness easily gets injured. From this, I realized that those with reversed Qi are not only suffering from consumption. If there is cold on the outside, it may lead to boils, shortness of breath, mania, obstruction in the chest, lung consumption, or water retention; if heat invades the organs, it can cause shock, nosebleeds, consumption of the diaphragm, frailty, and abdominal death; if it affects the bowels, it may lead to urinary retention, blood in urine, mouth ulcers, abdominal tension, food issues, throat obstruction, nasal congestion, nosebleeds, or blindness. These twenty-one conditions are all discussed in the theory of Qi counterflow. The text states: All upward counterflows pertain to fire. With just one sentence, an astute reader can seek understanding from it.<br>East Garden&#39;s &quot;Ten Books&quot; by Li Gao, Yuan Dynasty.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Thirst</strong></p>
<p>The distinctions of Yin and Yang state that &quot;the two Yangs converging is called &#39;thirst.&#39;&quot; The Treatise on the Essentials of Pulse states: &quot;dampness becomes thirst.&quot; The two Yangs refer to Yangming. The Hand Yangming (large intestine) governs fluid ailments; when dampness (thirst) occurs, the eyes turn yellow and the mouth becomes dry, indicating insufficient fluids. The Foot Yangming (stomach) governs blood; when heat arises, it causes a thirst for food and a craving for snacks, indicative of blood deficiency due to latent fire. Convergence signifies insufficient bodily fluids that are stagnant and not nourishing, leading to conditions of dryness and heat. This arises from consuming excessively sweet and rich food, causing qi to overflow upward and transform into thirst; such conditions are treated with medicinal herbs like orchid to eliminate stale qi. One must avoid sticky, rich, fragrant food and mineral medicines, as their essence is harsh and can exacerbate dryness and heat.</p>
<p>A speaker from Yue states: &quot;When evils reside in the six yang organs, the Yang pulse becomes disharmonious; if the Yang pulse is disharmonious, qi will accumulate, leading to an excess of Yang, and if Yang is too excessive, Yin energy cannot nourish, resulting in the thinning and depletion of skin and muscles.&quot; The Classics say: &quot;In treating consumption, fatigue, partial paralysis, atrophy, fullness of qi, and rebellious movement in the body, the wealthy who indulge in rich foods suffer these ailments.&quot;</p>
<p>Qibo states: &quot;When the pulse is full, long-lasting illnesses can be treated; when the pulse is thin and small, lasting illnesses are difficult to treat.&quot; The conditions are then classified into three types of thirst. </p>
<p>The first type, known as &quot;upper thirst,&quot; manifests as a red and cracked tongue with great thirst and a desire to drink. The Reverse Regulation Theory states that heat moves from the heart to the lungs, resulting in &quot;diaphragmatic thirst,&quot; which can be treated with Baihu Decoction augmented with ginseng.</p>
<p>The second type, &quot;middle thirst,&quot; involves good appetite but thinness, spontaneous sweating, constipation, and frequent urination. Shuhe states: &quot;Dry mouth with a desire for more water, despite eating plenty, indicates a deficiency type of thirst.&quot;<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>To regulate the stomach, use the Shenqi Decoction and Sanyuan Pill. In cases of lower consumption, there is restlessness with a thirst for water, dry ears, and urination resembling grease. Shuhe states: &quot;When there is extreme restlessness, water is easily depleted, indicating kidney consumption.&quot; Treat it with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. The Comprehensive Directory mentions: &quot;If there are the signs of brain abscess and back sores in those able to eat, it is a dire indication; if unable to eat, it points to abdominal fullness and bloating, both signs of untreatability.&quot; The ancient elder Jiegu differentiated treatments: those who can eat but are thirsty should take the White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng; those who cannot eat but are thirsty should take the Qian Family Bai Zhu Powder with an increased dose of Kudzu root. Once the upper and middle levels are balanced, there will be no more lower consumption. Previous physicians had sound intentions in their prescriptions! Some ask: &quot;What are the signs of abscesses and sores in cases of upper consumption?&quot; This is due to the fire pathogen overpowering. The sores are very painful but do not rupture, sometimes with blood-like water. The classic states: &quot;If it has a form but no pain, it belongs to the Yang category.&quot; Attack the Yang urgently, while avoiding the Yin; treatment should focus on the lower regions. When vital energy is strong, there is life; when it is lost, there is death. What is the cause of the fullness in the abdomen for those who have consumed? It is treating cold with heat; even the practitioners cannot abandon established methods in favor of new ones. However, organs have varying distances: the heart and lungs are close, hence should be administered in smaller amounts, while the kidney and liver are farther apart and should receive larger doses, each appropriately considering their conditions. Whether one overdoses or underdoses leads to a situation lacking errors in judgment. For high and middle consumption, if treated too abruptly, the disease may pass quickly, leading to lasting abdominal fullness, which precisely indicates the upper heat has not been resolved while the middle cold has resurfaced. This is not the fault of the medicine but rather a failure to appropriately gauge the urgency of the treatments. Therefore, more attention should be given to the prescribing methods.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Differentiation of Internal and External Injuries</strong></p>
<p>When the external evil of wind and cold affects the body for three days, there is a loss of appetite and reduction of fluids, leading to thirst as the pathogenic qi penetrates inward. In contrast, individuals who suffer internal injuries from imbalanced diet or prolonged labor and illness will not feel thirsty, as the pathogenic qi remains excess within the blood vessels. Initially, those who have been overworked, and whose diet has been irregular, will definitely experience thirst if the damage is severe; this is due to the heart fire blazing upward, attacking the lung metal, hence the thirst. </p>
<p>It is important to discern this. Even if there is a desire to drink cold water, it should be given slowly in small amounts, without yielding to the urge to drink excessively. Too much water can excessively drain the stomach qi, resulting in mild distension or severe transmission of various diseases. The person will inevitably experience recurring disturbances, unrest in the pulse, and increased severity at night, making it difficult to find relief in sleep—this cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Methods</strong><br>If there is fever, aversion to heat, and thirst with red eyes, it indicates an internal disease. The hand taiyin (lung) is deficient and cannot regulate the yang qi. One should use ingredients such as wolfberries, fresh rehmannia, and cooked rehmannia as the main treatment. If the pulse is surging and large, and especially if it results in vomiting blood, it indicates a significant condition.</p>
<p>For thirst in the upper jiao with spontaneous urination, white tiger decoction should be used.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In the middle jiao, if thirst is present and urination and defecation are not smooth, the prescription is the Tonic for Regulating the Stomach and Invigorating Qi. In the lower jiao, if there is thirst, red and scanty urine, and difficult bowel movements, the prescription is the Tonic for Greatly Purging Qi. For thirst arising from the six meridians, each should be treated according to its respective meridian&#39;s medicine.</p>
<p>For those with exterior heat, an aversion to heat, and thirst, the prescription is the White Tiger Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Danxi’s Heart Method</strong> (Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>For diabetes, focus on nourishing the lungs, lowering fire, and generating blood, addressing it in three stages: upper, middle, and lower. All three types of diabetes must avoid the use of Pinellia, and those with blood deficiency should also refrain from its use. Those experiencing dry mouth, throat pain, intestinal dryness, or difficult bowel movements should not use it either, and those with excessive sweating should avoid it. If absolutely necessary, ginger can be employed as a controlling agent. If diabetes presents with diarrhea, first use a powdered mix of Atractylodes and White Peony prepared by frying, then follow it with juices and syrups from previous medications. Additionally, Trichosanthes powder is a superb remedy for diabetes. </p>
<p>In cases of internal injury that leave persistent dryness and thirst, there may be residual heat in the lung meridian; one can use a small amount of ginseng, Poria, and licorice mixed with ginger juice to take cold, or use a teaspoon to add ginger juice to it. For those with deficiency, ginseng soup is permissible.</p>
<p>Water encompasses heaven and earth, and it has been said by predecessors. Thus, if humanity occupies the middle of heaven and earth, can water also nourish and moisten the five viscera? It is said that heavenly water is generated first, with the kidneys being its main source. The bladder is the receptacle for fluids, thus promoting the flow of kidney water upward to moisten the lungs. Hence, wise practitioners regard the lungs as the organ of fluids, extending from above to below, with the three jiao organs embodying true water of heaven. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that the origin of water is in the kidneys, and its culmination is in the lungs.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>When the water does not run out, how can one speak of thirst? People indulge in their desires, excessively consume alcohol, and have a strong craving for rich, spicy, preserved, sour, and salty foods. They also use cinnabar and precious stones to satisfy their desires. Consequently, the fiery heat rises, and their internal organs generate heat, becoming dry and scorching, leading to the drying up of fluids, making them crave water yet unable to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>The heat ascends, affecting the heart, which becomes empty and diffuse, unable to contain itself. This results in agitation in the chest, a red tongue, and red lips. They often feel thirsty, need to drink frequently, urinate a little, and this condition, attributed to the upper body, is called &quot;wasting thirst.&quot; </p>
<p>If heat accumulates within, and the spleen is weak, it may produce hunger and lead to excessive eating without gaining flesh. This type of thirst is not very bothersome; they merely desire cold drinks, urinate frequently with sweet-smelling urine, and this condition is attributed to the middle body, called &quot;thirst of the middle.&quot;</p>
<p>If heat settles below, affecting the kidneys, the legs and knees become thin and weak, joints ache, and vital essence is exhausted, leading to a need for water that is not overly frequent and sometimes results in abundant and turbid urination. This condition is attributed to the lower body and is called &quot;thirst of the kidneys.&quot;</p>
<p>If one experiences severe wasting thirst, death could ensue. The treatment should primarily focus on nourishing the spleen with white atractylodes powder to generate bodily fluids. It is also beneficial to cook good quality rice into porridge and eat it to strengthen the kidneys, which helps regulate water. Additionally, a clean preparation of coptis can be ground and placed tightly inside a pig&#39;s stomach, steamed with some rice until soft, then made into pellets the size of a tung seed. Consuming one hundred pellets, followed by rice and water, can help clear the heart and quench thirst.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Hygiene Treasure</strong><br><strong>By Luo Tianyi (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing the Six Meridians of Thirst</strong></p>
<p>For a Yangming thirst with a floating pulse and no sweat, use remedies like Wuling and Huashi. For a Yangming thirst with a long pulse and sweating, use remedies like Baihu and Liangge. For a Shaoyang thirst with a wiry pulse and vomiting, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction with Melastoma like root. For a Taiyin thirst with a thin pulse and unwillingness to drink water, even if drinking, only thinking of soup and not water, use remedies like Si Junzi and Lizhong Decoction. For a Shaoyin thirst with a sinking pulse and self-relief, use Zhu Ling Decoction and Sanhuang Decoction. For a Jueyin thirst with a faint pulse and a desire to sip, give only a little water. </p>
<p>Huashi treats thirst primarily due to unbeneficial orifices, as it is drying and can deplete fluid. When excessive dampness is present, it should be used; however, if there is no dampness and it is used, it would be a violation of the rules. If urination is not smooth, whether thirsty or not, it indicates the presence of internal damp-heat.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>When urination occurs naturally but there is thirst, it indicates internal dryness. Dampness should be dealt with by draining it, while dryness should be addressed with moisturizing; then it will be appropriate. In mixed conditions, if there is sweating and thirst, use a pungent remedy to moisten; if there is no sweating and thirst, use a bitter remedy to strengthen. </p>
<p>For those with a cold disease, who eat little and feel thirsty, one should employ stomach-regulating medicine to stop the thirst. Cooling medicines should not be used, as they could damage stomach qi, making it even harder to eat. Bai Zhu and Fu Ling are such remedies. </p>
<p>If there is thirst without sweating in the Taiyang stage, Bai Hu should not be used. If the pulse is strong and rapid after sweating, it may be given. In the Yangming stage, if there is sweating and thirst, Wu Ling should not be used. If urination is impaired, with little sweating and a floating pulse, it should be administered.</p>
<p>If a person suffers from heat in the heart and lungs but does not feel thirsty, it indicates that the issue is not rooted in the Taiyin or Shaoyin, but is merely superficial. In a superficial condition, there is no thirst; if there is thirst, then it is originating from deeper issues.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Complete Record of Medicine, Volume 281</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Door of Thirst</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</p>
<p><strong>Destruction of Thirst</strong></p>
<p>The three types of &quot;thirst&quot; arise from the excess of qi, the deficiency of blood, and the vacuity of energy. If left untreated for a long time, extreme vacuity of qi leads to an inability to take action. One monk exclusively used a modified Astragalus decoction, emphasizing the enhancement of blood. The three types of thirst involve excessive urination. The upper thirst affects the heart, manifesting as fiery heat ascending with great thirst and increased urination. The middle thirst affects the spleen, resulting in warm dryness, increased appetite, and correspondingly excessive urination. The lower thirst affects the kidneys, where kidney weakness prevents water retention, leading to much urination without thirst. However, with frequent urination, body fluids will inevitably be depleted, and over time, one will experience persistent thirst—regardless of previous claims of being &quot;fully quenched,&quot; this is not a valid argument. For the various types of thirst, one should avoid using harsh, drying tonics and instead focus on nourishment. Aside from the spleen type, for the heart and kidney types, it is advisable to use an Astragalus decoction combined with either the Eight Flavor Pill, the Yuan Tu Dan, or the Minor Tu Si Zi Pill. Additionally, Bamboo Dragon Powder can also be used. The Six Divine Decoction is also effective for kidney issues; however, for spleen issues, add Angelica while omitting Astragalus.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>When there is frequent urination from the three types of wasting, there will certainly be constipation. It is advisable to regularly take the Four Substance Decoction to moisten the large intestine. Adding ginseng, papaya, and pollen, then cooking it into porridge with glutinous rice can also be effective. </p>
<p>For those with frequent urination that does not smell foul but instead has a sweet scent, stirring up in the urinal, this illness is severe. Additionally, if there are floating substances on the surface of the urine like pig fat and splashes on the sides of the urinal resembling cypress candle tears, this essence is exhausted, leading to a depletion of true vitality.</p>
<p>In cases of upper and middle wasting, with the heart and spleen being so hot, urination may be scant without restrictions, as there is dryness and heat above and deficiency and cold below, resulting in thirst. </p>
<p>After prolonged wasting, with vital essence and blood depleted, one may experience blindness or paralysis in the hands and feet like a stroke, which is not wind. This symptom of kidney wasting arises from excess. Wasting of the heart often occurs due to excessive desires for food and drink, as well as the consumption of spicy and hot foods. </p>
<p>With excessive drinking, urination also increases. It is essential to suppress heart fire to bring it down; naturally, thirst will decrease. One should use Banxia Xiexin Decoction while removing the dry ginger and adding (herbs) like lou and dried kudzu in appropriate amounts. Swallowing pig’s stomach pills or Jiulian pills, along with alone-tasting Huanglian Decoction, should be brewed many times until cooled. When feeling thirsty, drink freely; over time, this will lead to self-recovery. </p>
<p>Alternatively, porridge made from glutinous rice can be cooked thinly, combined with Ying Soup and Mei Flower Soup, which can be used for those experiencing thirst related to the three types of wasting.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>If the mind is overexerted, leading to a rise of heart fire and resultant thirst, it is advisable to use a drink made of astragalus combined with half a portion of lotus seeds and polygala, and to swallow Yuan Tu Dan; additionally, boil barley to make a decoction, alternating with Ling Sha Dan. </p>
<p>To alleviate spleen deficiency, due to the spleen channel being dry and hot, food becomes easily digestible, leading to frequent urination and cyclical hunger. Spleen deficiency is classified into three types: deficiency in the middle, deficiency from cold, and deficiency from heat. For this, it is best to use a drink made of lotus leaves combined with half a portion of raw rehmannia and dried kudzu, or alternatively use the Wu Jin powder or simply the lotus drink.</p>
<p>If excessive desire leads to disharmony between water and fire, causing kidney water to drain and heart fire to burn, resulting in thirst, cooling heart remedies are not recommended. Instead, one should bolster kidney water to support heart fire. For this purpose, use a drink of astragalus with half a portion of cistanche and five-flavor fruit, swallow Ba Wei Wan and small toosanjia pills, Yuan Tu Dan, deer horn pills, and modified An Shen Wan can all be selected for use, or Ling Sha Dan.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Consumption of the kidneys is a serious illness, heavier than other types of consumption. Ancient texts refer to it as &quot;strengthening the center&quot; and &quot;internal consumption.&quot; It is often caused by indulgence in sensual desires or by ingesting metals and stones. When kidney energy declines and stone energy remains, there is no essence to nourish, resulting in persistent deficiency. Yang fails to unite with essence, leading to excessive urination, dryness of the lips and mouth. </p>
<p>For treatment, one can use Huangqi decoction, Tongyuan dan, Bawwei pill, Lurong pill, Jiantian Kidney Energy pill, and Xiaotusi seed pill. If these are ineffective, Huangqi decoction can be augmented with four parts each of Corgong, Beiwuwu, and Shanzhuyu, as well as Jilong pill and Corgong pill. </p>
<p>In addition to the three types of consumption, there is the thirst from fruit tree consumption, for which musk medications are appropriate. The thirst associated with various illnesses has been addressed in their respective categories.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>Now, I will specifically mention treatments for those who are thirsty without having a disease, as well as for those who experience thirst after illness. Options include Shenling Powder, Four Gentlemen Decoction, and Spleen-Reducing Decoction, or Qi Zhen Powder augmented with a penny of papaya, all of which may be selected. The Five-Ingredient Powder for Promoting Urination with an addition of a penny of ginseng is called Spring Marsh Decoction; the combination of Five-Ingredient Powder and Four Gentlemen Decoction is also termed Spring Marsh Decoction. This is particularly important, and it is also useful to prepare Four Elderly Congee as food.</p>
<p>For various diseases that have long-term effects, leading to kidney deficiency and thirst, it is advisable to use Eight-Flavored Pill, Astragalus Decoction, or Four Substance Decoction with half a penny of ginseng and papaya, or Qi Zhen Drink and Great Supplement Decoction, excluding the herb Atractylodes, while adding papaya as needed.</p>
<p>For those who have lost blood or for postpartum women experiencing thirst during confinement, this is called blood thirst, and it is important to seek remedies that nourish the blood, which has already been discussed in the main text.</p>
<p>If a person suddenly experiences intense thirst without an underlying condition but the thirst subsides after a short while, it is best to use honey water and Spleen-Reducing Decoction, while also drinking a few sips of cool rice gruel or the like. </p>
<p>For those who experience thirst from alcohol consumption, a mixture of dry kudzu root with Five-Ingredient Powder should be used.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Medical Summary</strong><br><em>By Lou Ying, Ming Dynasty</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Xiao Ke (Diabetes)</strong>  </p>
<p>Upper Xiao refers to what is known as &quot;ge xiao.&quot; Ge xiao means thirst accompanied by excessive drinking. Middle Xiao is referred to as &quot;xiao zhong.&quot; Xiao zhong means thirst with increased eating and drinking; or drinking alone without thirst. Lower Xiao is referred to as &quot;shen xiao.&quot; Shen xiao means drinking once leads to urination twice, with urine resembling greasy oil. This is a transformation from ge xiao or xiao zhong. Wang’s commentary states: “Lung energy is exhausted and cannot retain.” The lungs store energy, and when they are healthy, they can manage and gather fluids. The refined essence of these fluids nourishes tendons, bones, and blood vessels, while the remainder is expelled as urine. When the lungs are diseased, they cannot manage the fluids, and the refined essence is also lost through urine, leading to excessive urination that resembles greasy oil. Without sufficient fluids to nourish tendons, bones, and blood vessels, diseases manifest gradually, causing thinness and dryness. However, lung diseases originate from kidney deficiency. When the kidneys are deficient, the heart becomes fearful; excessive actions harm the lungs, leading coldness to invade, and then lung disease develops. Thus, Zhong Jing treated thirst with an increased volume of urination using Shenqi Pills to replenish the kidneys and assist the lungs; hence, later generations termed it &quot;shen xiao&quot; and &quot;lower xiao.&quot;<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Some say: The scriptures state that when lung consumption leads to death and cannot be treated, why does Zhong Jing use Shen Qi Wan to address it? I say: If the patient drinks one measure and urinates two, it is beyond treatment. However, if they drink one and have not yet urinated twice, the illness is still mild and may be treatable. Thus, Zhong Jing&#39;s Shen Qi Wan is used for conditions where one drinks a斗 (a unit of measure) of water and also urinates a斗 of fluid. If the urine exceeds the intake, it is also beyond assistance.</p>
<p>Irregularity in diet and exhaustion weaken the spleen and stomach, leading to illnesses of blood, which primarily cause the fluids in the mouth to fail to circulate, resulting in dryness of the mouth and throat. The patient mistakenly believes they are thirsty, leading the physician to use Wu Ling San to treat it, which instead exacerbates thirst and dryness, resulting in serious depletion of fluids and risk of death. The scriptures say: &quot;When there is deficiency, one must nourish its mother.&quot; Therefore, one should nourish the heart and small intestine. This is fundamental support for the spleen and stomach, using sweet and warm medicines as the main treatment, bitter cold as the means, and sour as the assisting ministers. When the heart is deficient, one should quickly consume sour substances to gather it; if heart fire is strong, the lung metal suffers from pathogenic influences, and when metal is deficient, it should be nourished with sour substances; then add sweet and warm, and sweet and cold agents, to drain the excess heart fire from the spleen and stomach. This is addressing the root of the issue.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Li Chan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xiaoke (Diabetes)</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The condition called Xiaoke is due to the binding of the two Yangs. The two Yangs refer to the Hand Yangming (large intestine) governing fluids and the Foot Yangming (stomach) governing blood. When fluids and blood are insufficient, it leads to Xiaoke. There is also a condition of dryness and blockage, as the lungs and large intestine are interrelated. </p>
<p>For thirst due to Qi deficiency, it occurs from external pathogens invading inward, or from consuming excessively dry food, causing heat to deplete fluids. Such individuals prefer drinking cold water; they should be given cold and cooling diuretics to clear the heat. Once the heat dissipates, Yin is restored and thirst will subside. </p>
<p>For thirst due to blood deficiency, it is caused by internal injuries or overwork, leading to depletion of spirit and a failure of stomach Qi to rise. This can occur after illness when the stomach is weak and fluids are depleted, or from residual heat in the lungs, resulting in a dry mouth and thirst. Such individuals prefer hot soup; they should be given warming and nourishing agents to replenish Yin. Once Yin is restored, dryness will lessen and thirst will cease.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Xiao&quot; means to burn, akin to how fire cooks and burns. When the three types of Xiao (upper, middle, lower) are balanced, the condition does not descend further. The upper is light, the middle is heavy, and the lower is critical. Ultimately, all arise from the lungs being attacked by fire pathogens, enduring for a long time, causing stagnation of Qi and blood. Thus, those who can eat experience overflow of fluids leading to abscesses; those who cannot eat suffer from distention and increased internal heat. Both conditions are critical.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Heat in the upper jiao causes agitation of the heart and lungs, with a red tongue and red lips. If there is little appetite and frequent urination, one should take Siwu Decoction combined with Shengmai Powder plus Tianhuafen, Dihuang juice, lotus root juice, and milk. For drinkers, add kudzu juice. If one can eat, use Baihu Decoction with ginseng; if not, use Qian&#39;s Baizhu Powder or Qingxin Lotus Seed Drink. If there is fullness in the diaphragm, it is called diaphragm exhaustion, and one should use Mendan Drink. When heat penetrates the flesh and transforms into abscesses, use Jinyenteng Pill, Huaiqi Liuyi Decoction, or Yiyuan Powder.</p>
<p>Heat accumulating in the middle jiao leads to symptoms like the spleen and stomach being weakened with an increased appetite but not much thirst, red and frequent urination, and constipation. Use Siwu Decoction with Zhimu, Huangbai, Shigao, Huangqin, and Huashi to clear the heat. In severe cases, use Tiaogui Chengqi Decoction or Sanhuang Pill. When the illness starts with cold leading to excess yin and then transforms to heat in the middle, use Shengma Gekun Decoction or Xiehuang Powder. For toxin due to damp accumulation, use Xiaopi Pill. For deficiency, use Qian&#39;s Baizhu Powder. For blocked bowels, use Danggui Runzi Decoction. For diarrhea, use Baizhu Shaoyao Decoction. For both upward and downward reflux, use Lanxiang Drink. When heart fire invades the spleen, use Huanglian Zhu&#39;s Stomach Pill.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>If the liver invades the qi, leading to hot body temperature and loss of appetite, with the risk of vomiting worms upon eating, administer Wumei Pills or Iron Powder Pills. For those with worms consuming their body fluids, use Dan Kuliang Decoction. If water accumulates below and transforms into a distended lump, use Sanling Powder, or remove the cinnamon and add ginseng for better effect. </p>
<p>When heat lurks in the lower abdomen, causing depletion of essence from the kidneys, and water self-harms, leading to immediate urination with cloudy urine resembling cream, emaciated legs and knees, dark complexion, and scorched ears, the prescription is Siwu Decoction with added Zhimu, Huangbo, Wuweizi, Yuanshen, and human milk, to harmonize water and fire; it can also be supplemented with Yin Pill, Kidney Qi Pill, or Kanli Pill, and Bamei Pill removing Aconite while adding Wuweizi, Yuandudan, and Lutu Pill, along with Mengshou Tianwang Heart-Supplementing Pill, Wei Xi Pill, Miaoxiang Powder, or Danjian Silk Decoction; or Shiquan Dabu Decoction removing cinnamon, doubling the earth essence while adding Zhimu and Huangbo. </p>
<p>For those with excess heat above and cold below, use Qingxin Lianzidan Drink. If someone has excessive stone energy and their true qi is exhausted while the stone energy remains, causing the yang pathway to become strong without mingling essence and leakage, this state is referred to as &quot;strong inside.&quot;<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>Urine may be oily, red-yellow, or pale white; it may be accompanied by thirst and frequent urination, or thirst without urination, or urination without thirst. When food and drink enter the stomach, it is like pouring soup on snow, and it is expelled with urine, forming a residue like white fat. Those who grow thinner daily have no remedy. </p>
<p>To treat thirst, initially nourish the lungs and descend the heart, then for a long time nourish the kidneys and strengthen the spleen. The root cause lies in the kidneys, while the symptoms are in the lungs. When the kidneys are warm, qi rises and the lungs are moistened; when the kidneys are cold, qi does not rise and the lungs dry out. Therefore, the Kidney Qi Pill is an excellent remedy for thirst. However, both the heart and kidneys connect through the spleen; nourishing the spleen will naturally produce bodily fluids, as seen in the Ginseng and Atractylodes Powder. For the three types of wasting and thirsting, the use of Single Clam Powder is advised, mixed with water for intake, to restore fluids and quench thirst. The Single (Herb) Stem Pill is a divine remedy for thirst. Avoid 半夏 (Banxia) drying agents.</p>
<p>Water encompasses heaven and earth, and the organs of the human body are also enveloped in fluid and true water. The tangible forms of water, such as exchanges and the earth, are what we consider as water; while the intangible is the water born of the sky, which is qi, linked to the trigram Kan (Water) and Qian (Heaven). To manage the intangible water with the intangible fire, this is known as &#39;Completed Accomplishment.&#39; </p>
<p>For mixed diseases, there is a prevalence of excess thirst and deficient heat, while true heat is less common. After onset of thirst, acupuncture should be avoided, as it may draw out fluids and lead to death.</p>
<p>— Medical Commentary by Zhao Xianke (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>— On Thirst and Wasting<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>Upper消 (xiaosh消) refers to a condition where the tongue is red and cracked, leading to extreme thirst. The reverse adjustment theory says that heat from the heart transforms and transmits to the lungs, resulting in upper消. This can be treated with Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction) with added ginseng.</p>
<p>Middle消 (zhongxiaosh消) is characterized by good appetite but thinness, spontaneous sweating, hard stools, and frequent urination. Shuhe states that a dry mouth and increased thirst, along with excessive eating leading to muscular weakness and the formation of middle消, can be treated with Tiaowei Chengqi Decoction.</p>
<p>Lower消 (xiash消) presents with restlessness and thirst, dry and burnt ears, and urination resembling oil. Shuhe indicates that the intense thirst and irritability suggest this is kidney消. It can be treated with Liuwu Wan (Six-Flavor Pill).</p>
<p>The ancient methods to treat the three jiaos (sanjiao) are detailed, but I have another perspective. When a person&#39;s water and fire are balanced, and their qi and blood are adequately nourished, there should be no消. However, if there is improper nourishment, with water and fire imbalanced, fluids become dried out, leading to a fiery upward blaze. Prolonged boiling leads to digestive exhaustion, and the five organs become dry, resulting in emaciation and fatigue. Therefore, the method to treat消 should not divide into upper, middle, or lower; rather, one should prioritize treating the kidney as urgent. Only the Six-Flavor, Eight-Flavor, and modified Eight-Flavor Pills should be taken according to symptoms, reducing heart fire and nourishing kidney water, thus alleviating thirst. Bai Hu and Chengqi should not be used for treatment.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Records&quot; states that those who can&#39;t eat but are thirsty indicate a fullness in the middle that is not transmitted; those who can eat and are thirsty are likely to develop abscesses on the back of the neck. The inability to eat points to a problem with the spleen, which should nourish the surrounding areas and work with the stomach to manage fluids. If both the spleen and stomach are deficient, they cannot distribute their fluids, leading to thirst. Even if a person can eat, it is a sign of a weak stomach trying to remedy itself.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>If one indiscriminately uses cold and cooling herbs to clear heat, such as the White Tiger Decoction or the Chengqi Decoction, then the internal heat will not be cleared, and cold will reappear, leading to distension—how can that avoid transmission? Only formulas such as the Seven Ingredient Bai Zhu Powder or the Ren Shen Sheng Mai Powder should be used, allowing for ample drinking, while also using the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish the source of transformation. That is the correct method of treatment. If one can eat and feels thirsty, and develops ulcers, that is a disease of the wealthy, indulging in rich foods. They frequently consume sweet and fatty foods, thus their upper qi overflows and causes thirst. One should not take rich foods or fragrant herbs, as their energy is harsh and can exacerbate dryness and heat. The classics say: “To treat it with orchids is to remove the stale qi.” One should also avoid cold and cooling remedies and those that cause abscesses. Why is that? The classics state: “The transformation from rich foods leads to numerous large sores.” That is what is meant.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>When the kidney is deficient and there are brain abscesses or back sores, it is said that the kidney governs the bones, and the brain is the sea of the kidneys. The back corresponds to the area affected by cold water passing through the Shaoyang channel. When the water is drained and the sea is depleted, and the yin fire rises, how can abscesses and sores not develop? If the sores are severe but do not ulcerate, they may present as red fluid; if extreme, they may appear black or purple. The fire’s intensity resembles the essence of water, indicating that the kidney&#39;s water has been exhausted and cannot be treated. However, if one might strongly replenish the yin, there may still be a chance to save it.</p>
<p>Someone asks: Why do people who take Rehmannia Decoction remain thirsty and cannot be quenched? The answer is: These practitioners cannot abandon their established methods and try a new approach. The heart and lungs are positioned closely, so a smaller dose is appropriate; conversely, the kidney and liver are farther apart, allowing for a larger dose. For conditions with high or middle level consumption, one may use pills in moderation to treat them. However, if lower consumption is at its peak, with great thirst and dryness, one must increase or adjust the eight-flavor pill&#39;s dosage to one sheng, adding one liang of cinnamon, boiling it in six or seven bowls of water, and drinking it iced to indulge. If one sleeps well, their thirst problem will be resolved.</p>
<p>The formulation of prescriptions depends on the adaptability of the person. </p>
<p>Another inquiry: For lower consumption without water, using the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill can nourish the kidney water of the less yin; why add Aconite and Cinnamon? It is because the fire at the Mingmen is weak and cannot transform food and water; the essence of food and water cannot ascend to moisten the lungs, like a cauldron without fuel, leaving the pot dry, hence the thirst.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>As for the lungs, they have nothing to depend on; they are unable to distribute the essence of water evenly, and operate through the five organs. The water one drinks, if not processed by fire, directly enters the bladder, which means drinking one liter results in one liter of urine, and drinking one斗 results in one斗 of urine. If you taste it, it is sweet but not salty, which is evident. Therefore, using the warming and pungent properties of Aconite and Cinnamon strengthens their slight heat. Adding firewood under the stove, as dry rice grains benefit from rain, new life emerges. Only the wise understand this, while the ignorant often consider it impractical. In the past, Emperor Wu of Han suffered from thirst, and Zhang Zhongjing prescribed this formula, now known in the Sacred Yuan Pass, and it can still be recalled today. The Eight Flavor Pill is indeed a good remedy. After wounds and sores heal, and for those who are very thirsty just before recovery, with a yellow, hard tongue; and for those who suffer from thirst beforehand, or those who feel restless and thirsty, with frequent urination, or cloudy discharges, loss of appetite, thin body, swollen legs and thin feet, mouth sores – anyone who takes it will find it effective.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>A nobleman fell ill with a disease, and while his condition had not yet stabilized, he became exceedingly thirsty. One day he drank several liters of water. Out of foolishness, I offered a modified version of the Rehmannia formula. The other doctors laughed aloud, saying, &quot;If this medicine can quench thirst, we would no longer need to practice medicine.&quot; They all prescribed medicines like papaya, perilla, black plum, ginseng, poria, and various decoctions to generate bodily fluids, but his thirst only intensified. After several doses, there was no effect whatsoever. Reluctantly, they resorted to the previous formula, and after three days, his thirst ceased. Because of my belief in the long-term efficacy of this medicine, not only did his thirst disappear, but his vitality was also strengthened, and his appetite increased, surpassing even his youth. This usage of the medicine is not just based on my narrow view; it indeed has historical roots. The Xue family has preserved this formula, having used it with verified results multiple times. Hence, I detail it here so that those suffering from thirst can trust its efficacy, dedicatedly use the medicine, and not be misled by mediocre doctors, thereby expanding upon the wisdom of our predecessors. Long-term use lightens the body, sharpens the senses, and brings luminosity to one&#39;s appearance.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>The five flavors mainly found in the north are particularly effective, especially for replenishing kidney water and calming the fiery energy of the heart. Among these, the herb cinnamon must not be neglected; if it is removed, the remedy will be ineffective. </p>
<p>A man suffering from this condition attempted to treat it with a previous formula but replaced cinnamon with drugs such as coptis and anemarrhena, believing that cinnamon is too warming. He remained relentlessly thirsty, developed back sores, and ultimately died. Indeed, cinnamon is a medicinal ingredient for the kidney channel. The previous signs indicated a deficiency of kidney fire rising upwards, which, without proper regulation, became harmful; thus, cinnamon was used to guide other medicines to nourish and redirect the deficient fire back to its source, leading to its efficacy. Cheng Wujin states: Cinnamon is particularly guiding, aiding in directing yang energy, like a harness that leads the flow.</p>
<p>As for the issue of upward consumption, it refers to heat from the heart moving into the lungs; and for middle consumption, it refers to internal deficiencies causing stomach heat. All recognize heat as harmful, which leads to the use of formulas like Bai Hu or Cheng Qi, ultimately resulting in failure to save the patient.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>In summary, this concerns the lower burner and the vital gate; when the fire does not return to its origin and wanders in the lungs, it results in upper depletion; when it wanders in the stomach, it results in middle depletion. Using the Eight Flavor Kidney Qi Pill to draw the fire back to its origin allows the fire to settle at the bottom of the cauldron, balancing water and fire. When the Qi rises and steams, the lungs suffer from dampness, leading to thirst and illness recovery. </p>
<p>There is a type of thirst that seeks to drink, but the person quickly becomes weary after just one or two sips of water, soon feeling thirsty again. They can only drink a little, unlike those with true thirst who drink without limit. This indicates a deficiency of middle Qi and coldness, where cold water rises to push against the wandering fire in the throat and tongue; hence, the upper burner craves water for relief. However, reaching the middle burner, the water encounters water and intensifies what is undesirable. Treatment: if the face is red and the person is agitated, administer the Li Zhong Decoction together with the Eight Flavor Pill.</p>
<p>Another type of thirst involves wanting to drink water but immediately vomits it back up after swallowing; shortly after, the person seeks more to drink but can hardly take in any food or medicine. This indicates an excess of yin obstructing yang, a sign of kidney channel injury due to cold. Zhang Zhongjing added human urine and bile to the Bai Tong formula, utilizing hot medicine with a cold exploration method; a single dose can lead to recovery. Many women experience this condition.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Thirst and Consumption</strong></p>
<p>The affliction of thirst often begins subtly and becomes pronounced, starting in the stomach and culminating in the lungs and kidneys. At first, it is like watering a burning fire; water can still extinguish it. But later, it becomes like pouring water on a stone; when the water is gone, the stone remains unchanged. When drinking and urinating becomes frequent, it consumes the true yin with dryness and fire, leading to exhaustion. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there are discussions but no treatments. The &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; contains both discussions and treatments. However, compilers have conflated the discussions in &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; concerning the Throat Meridian&#39;s thirst, leading later generations to be unable to distinguish appropriateness, which is also unsuitable for application. The transmission of cold damage indicates that when the heat pathogen reaches the Throat Meridian, it is entirely manifested; when heat penetrates deeply, thirst arises and consumption occurs. Once the heat resolves, there is no thirst and no consumption. Is this comparable to conditions arising from accumulated symptoms? I humbly propose a discussion based on the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The texts say that in treating conditions like consumption, collapse, atrophy, weakness, and rebellious qi in the abdomen, afflictions among the wealthy are due to rich foods, which are the sources of consumption. The wealthy who are not overweight may lack fresh food, while the overweight who are not wealthy might overindulge.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Fatty and expensive, rich wine with thick flavor—are these limited in quantity? Over time, consuming them generates internal heat, and bodily fluids dry up, leading one to seek relief from water. However, when water enters, it can still alleviate this, but the more it alleviates, the thirstier one becomes. The richer the food consumed, the worse the inner heat becomes, leading to the illness of internal consumption. Once this internal consumption manifests, it transmits through various pathways, whether upward or downward, especially in areas of intense heat.</p>
<p>Upper consumption occurs when the stomach, heated, affects the lungs, burdening the body. The heart, also heated, transfers this heat to the lungs, resulting in suffering for the metal (lungs). Metal is the source of water that emerges from higher origins. When consumed in the stomach, the essence overflows and rises, the lungs adjust the water pathways downward. Now, when heated, the water from the high source is violently pressured, mixing with externally consumed water, rushing down uncontrollably. Urinating often does not merely fail to eliminate external water, but also exhausts and drains the essence of innate water, leading to significant excess in waste discharge.</p>
<p>Therefore, without treatment, one dies. The so-called &quot;death of yin&quot; related to the heart and lungs, where death can occur within three days, refers to this. Thus, urinating often—first sign of danger.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>As for the stomach, its heat is transmitted down through the gate to the kidneys. The kidneys may be depleted by stone medicine, exhausting their essence. When a woman experiences this, yang is strong externally, while yin cannot maintain itself internally. This leads to cloudy urination like sludge; after drinking, urination occurs frequently, indicating kidney depletion. The classics mention that the nature of stone medicine is harsh, and it is said that the wind from the spleen transmits to the kidneys, causing what is known as hernia and distension, with pain in the lower abdomen and the discharge of white fluid, referred to as &quot;gu.&quot; This clearly indicates kidney depletion. </p>
<p>A physician named He states: Women possess yang; indulgence leads to internal heat and the affliction of &quot;gu.&quot; This elaboration on internal heat and the meaning of &quot;gu&quot; is quite clear. The Grand Minister Wang said: Depletion consumes the flesh like &quot;gu&quot; erodes. This is clearly evident from the term &quot;depletion,&quot; which is rather shallow. Indeed, being obsessed with women&#39;s beauty results in loss of will, and excessive loss of essence leads to turbid fluids, transforming back into a fire, which is the most perilous condition. The classics state: &quot;When the ruler&#39;s fire descends, yin essence supports it.&quot; Therefore, if there is an excess of yin essence, it is sufficient to support heart fire, signifying longevity; if yin essence is insufficient, heart fire will descend directly to the kidneys, leading to a decline in yang essence, resulting in premature death. </p>
<p>Thus, the kidneys serve as the gate of the stomach; if the gate lacks openness, water cannot be released and leads to swelling. If the gate is not closed, water is unceasingly expelled, resulting in thirst. Thirst is a condition belonging to the kidneys; the original text of &quot;Jin Kui&quot; remains unaltered, stating that when one drinks a dou, they urinate a dou, which is governed by kidney qi.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>Then steam transforms essence into water, ascending to receive the fire of the ruler, while halting the lower entry of the Yang energy. This is the true communication between heaven and earth. Zhang Zihe dared to disparage it. After denigrating Zhongjing, he praised Hejian, claiming its Shenxiong pill, made with the bitter taste of Huangqin, enters the heart, while Qianniu and Dahuang drive down the fire energy, using Shalstone to channel into the kidney meridian, effectively taking it away from the Kan. This truly grasps the secret of the Huangting. He twists this doctrine to cater to his own preferences, with a shallow understanding that is hardly worthy to enter Zhongjing’s door. He Bai&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Diabetes&quot; has already clarified its errors. Chang Guan&#39;s accounts have never treated diabetes, proving that without the issue, there can be no reasoning behind it. The discussion on fire at the beginning is not without its reason. However, applying the principle of purging Qi to treat vigorous fire leads to no effective result for diabetes. Thus, the fire of below diabetes is akin to fire in water; lowering it only intensifies the burn. The fire of middle diabetes is akin to the draining fire of marshes; lowering it only causes more harm. The fire of upper diabetes is like a wildfire; water that falls from heaven can extinguish it. Merely attacking the intestines and stomach is of no benefit, and instead causes harm. The earth&#39;s energy rises as clouds, and in turn, the heavens’ energy descends as rain; thus, rain arises from the earth&#39;s energy. If the earth’s energy does not rise, can the heavens rain? Therefore, it is imperative to elevate the earth&#39;s energy to nourish the three farmers, as well as to elevate the kidney&#39;s energy to irrigate the three burners—both are necessary truths. Not distinguishing this from the ancients, how can later generations adhere to what is clear?<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p>
<h3>Continuation of the Discussion</h3>
<p>In &quot;On Thirst,&quot; Chang discusses the essence of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; stating that it begins in the stomach and culminates in the lungs and kidneys, defining the three areas of consumption as being upper and middle. Other conditions like diaphragm consumption and food-related issues are also just forms of upper and middle consumption. However, without practical references from the &quot;Essential Prescription,&quot; my heart remained unsatisfied. Two years later, I suddenly remembered the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; stating: when there is labor and fatigue, the physical energy diminishes, and the energy of grains is not abundant. The upper burner does not function well, the stomach&#39;s energy is hot, and this heat disturbs the chest, resulting in internal heat. I realized that the disease in the chest is solely due to the energy of food and grain in the stomach, which circulates and nourishes the chest, allowing for clarity and brightness to manifest in one&#39;s own body.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>If there is fatigue or weariness that harms the fundamental energy and vital essence, then the energy in the chest becomes weak; the digestive energy in the stomach thereby does not thrive. When the digestive energy does not thrive, the injured energy in the chest becomes even harder to recover, and cannot be adequately replenished. Consequently, the digestive energy remains stagnant in the stomach, causing stagnation and heat within. This heat then pervades the chest, mixing with the weakened energy and transforming into internal heat. The balance between the chest and stomach becomes unsettled, making it impossible to avoid thirst and depletion. </p>
<p>Understanding this key point clarifies what has been previously misunderstood in the &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; text. It states: if the pulse at the wrist is floating and slow, the floating indicates deficiency, and the slow indicates fatigue. Deficiency implies insufficient protective energy, and fatigue means that the nourishing energy is depleted. If the pulse at the foot is floating and rapid, the floating signifies energy, and the rapid indicates that the digestive process is impaired and there is excessive solidity; abundant energy results in quick urination, and quick urination indicates solidity. When solidity and rapidity collide, this signifies thirst.</p>
<p>By examining the wrist pulse, one can assess the energy in the chest; by examining the pulse at the foot, one can assess the energy in the stomach. Clearly, there is a pulse to follow and evident signs to observe, yet it is difficult to discern the subtleties. The essence lies in the fact that yin resides within, safeguarding the yang; yang is outside, reinforcing the yin. A floating pulse at the wrist indicates that yin is not properly maintaining itself internally, thus, the yang in the external protective layer is floating and signifies deficiency. A slow pulse at the wrist indicates that yang is not effectively anchored externally, therefore, the yin safeguarding internally is slow and signifies fatigue. Overall, it is the injury of nourishing and protective energies that causes the wrist pulse to be deficient and slow. The nourishing energy pertains to the essence of food and water, while the protective energy pertains to their robust qualities. When both are deficient and slow, the energy from food and water fails to rise and fills the interior with stagnation, which is already evident of a weak diaphragm and stomach heat.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>In addition to the floating pulse of the Fuyang meridian, when it is floating it represents Qi, which corresponds to the changes described in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding heat Qi scorching the chest; when it is rapid, it indicates the consumption of food and the presence of a large hardness. In the earlier discussion, it is like water being poured over a stone: when the water is gone, the stone remains unchanged. This coincides with the presence of hardness in the stomach, where food is consumed but water is not, illustrating that the heat of fire can consume water, while water can quench thirst. When the stomach is hard and dry, it does not absorb water; instead, it is driven by the force of heat, leading to rapid urination, resulting in frequent urination. This depletion exacerbates dryness, thus the hardness and frequency clash, constituting thirst. Directly referencing the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; excessive bitterness, prolonged exposure to heat transforms it, and the spleen&#39;s Qi is not moistened, leading to a thickened stomach Qi — this is the source of thirst, both subtle and significant. After the Jin and Tang dynasties, while there were many who were wise and insightful, interpreting the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; each rising figure became notable in their own right, yet none entered the profound teachings of Zhang Zhongjing, as what they obtained from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; was shallow. Had they delved deeper, they could have correlated conditions, compared symptoms, and derived treatments based on pulse and symptomology to clarify established methods, but the remnants of the &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; have been passed down and recited in households.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Just as in cases of thirst, it is traditionally said that those with mid-thirst should be treated with purgatives, adhering to this principle without other considerations. Can one resolve the issue with just one treatment? Or should it be approached progressively? The stomach has become large and firm and does not accept nourishment easily; just administering purgatives may not yield results. The firm does not respond, while the weak does. The bladder does not act, but the large intestine does; could this not lead to complications driven by the medication, resulting in issues like fullness and swelling? The &quot;Comprehensive Record&quot; states: those who are able to eat but develop boils will inevitably suffer from severe swelling; those who cannot eat will certainly experience abdominal fullness and bloating, all of which are signs of an illness that cannot be treated. Various schools do not focus on the initial stages of the disease but rather on the later stages, employing many treatments like honeysuckle, blue leaves, and herbal pills, as well as combinations for abdominal fullness. What is their intention? The &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; suggests that in instances of slight urinary discomfort, one should early on use only clam as treatment, which is not mentioned in published formulas. Little do they know that softening and firming substances, if not treating deficiency can injure it, while this particular one is benign, effective for diuresis, and truly precious! Jiegao states: for those who can eat but are thirsty, one should use White Tiger Decoctio with ginseng. For those who cannot eat but are thirsty, one should use the Qian family&#39;s white atractylodes powder with kudzu root. The late-stage boils are a result of excessive fire; one must urgently attack the Yang, not the Yin. The fundamental qi of the lower region: if strengthened, life arises; if weakened, death ensues.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The text discusses the medical philosophy regarding the treatment of illnesses associated with excess heat and cold in the body. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the illness and the appropriate treatment methods. It criticizes rushing to use remedies without considering their effects on the body. The reference to the &quot;pure ancient elder&quot; suggests a reverence for traditional wisdom, particularly in avoiding aggressive treatments that could worsen a patient&#39;s condition. The mention of the three types of wasting diseases (消) relates to fire pathology, arguing that one must recognize how heat impacts different organs and should treat accordingly. It warns against merely addressing symptoms without understanding the root causes, illustrating the complexity of balancing yin and yang within the body. This balance is crucial in effective healing methods, and the text concludes by referencing the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which classifies illnesses related to the emergence of excess yang as wasting diseases.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>The &quot;two Yangs&quot; refers to the Yangming. The Yangming of the hand rules the large intestine and governs fluids; when disease leads to deficiency, one experiences yellowing of the eyes and dryness of the mouth, indicating insufficient fluids. The Yangming of the foot governs the stomach and rules the blood; when disease is hot, there is a tendency for excessive hunger and a lurking fire in the blood, indicating insufficient blood. A blockage arises from a lack of fluids and blood; when blocked and not moving, it is a disease caused by dryness.</p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: the heart transfers heat to the lungs, which results in diaphragm dysfunction. Zhang Zihe suggests that diaphragm dysfunction has not yet reached the lungs; when the heart transfers cold to the lungs, this constitutes lung dysfunction. By muddying the text, one misunderstands the &quot;Neijing.&quot; How could it be that the heart transfers heat to the lungs, and the lungs pass that heat to the diaphragm, but it has not yet affected the lungs? It is necessary to change the text to state that the heart transfers heat to the diaphragm, which then transmits it to the lungs, thereby avoiding confusion. </p>
<p>It must be understood that the heart and lungs both reside above the diaphragm, with the lungs being a delicate organ. Cold and heat can easily enter; however, when cold pathogens enter, they are bound externally, while hot pathogens enter and transmit outward. Both affect the lung tips, but treatment must differentiate them.</p>
<p>Liu Hejian discussed the disease of the &quot;three consumptions,&quot; attributing it to extreme depletion of the cold-deficient yin and excessive surplus of the hot-strong yang, leaving out the elements of wind and fire from the six influences.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The conditions known as &quot;Three Privations&quot;—namely, consuming thirst, consuming in the middle, and consuming of the kidneys—are categorized as such. Can there truly be a consumption of the middle and lower without thirst? It is stated in the texts that thirst can arise from various causes: heart and lung qi stagnation leading to thirst, liver blockage causing thirst, heat obstruction leading to thirst, stomach and large intestine heat causing thirst, spleen blockage resulting in thirst, kidney heat causing thirst, and small intestine heat causing thirst. The more one examines these causes, the more one finds them lacking in clarity regarding consuming thirst, merely citing thirst as a manifestation of dryness and heat depleting fluids, which is indeed puzzling. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Essentials of the Jade Mechanism,&quot; there is a deep discussion on this, erroneously attributing the cure for consumption to warming remedies for the kidneys; I am unsure what such warming medicines truly entail. Is there any reasoning in the world that a warming remedy could treat consuming thirst? The implication likely lies in the fact that it is not based on the &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; principle of Kidney Qi Pills. Yet Kidney Qi Pills invigorate kidney water and are known as the miraculous remedy for consuming thirst, recognized by later generations. Why then does Bai Zhai further elaborate on this? </p>
<p>I am concerned that later scholars might casually come across the discussions of Zi He and Zong Hou, which might confuse and mislead them further, prompting me to restate this point. The condition called &quot;Dampness&quot; leads to consuming in the middle, with intense stomach heat and excessive stomach fire, resulting in an increased appetite and thirst. Various schools suggest the use of Major Decoction to Purge for treatment. However, they fail to recognize that the accumulated heat, which has gradually developed, and the inherent fire will not be resolved by aggressive purging. Merely purging will be harmful to the intestines and stomach and will worsen the discomfort.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>Therefore, when necessary to use rhubarb, it must be long steamed to harmonize its properties. Moreover, it should not be combined with bitter orange or amomum, as this would exacerbate the urgency of the illness. The ancient remedy known as &quot;Shunli Powder&quot; implies a gentle approach, avoiding aggression. </p>
<p>The formula states: for treating internal heat in the stomach that affects appetite, with slight yellowish red urine and minimal urination, if one loses the desire to eat, it should not be overutilized. I fear that minimal urination leading to loss of appetite indicates that the stomach qi is already depleted. The method of purging medicine is not to be recklessly applied. </p>
<p>You harmonize this formula into &quot;Jiajian Sanyuan Pill,&quot; combining rhubarb with Scutellaria and Coptis, while not using bitter orange or amomum. The formula also addresses the toxicity and heat caused by mineral medications. By intuition, it must be used with substantial effectiveness, considering whether the condition of dryness is due to the body&#39;s genuine qi being consumed by excessive heat. Is there truly anyone of substantial build? </p>
<p>Thus, to eliminate the heat from the stomach, what must be done? I believe that prolonged steaming of rhubarb, combined with licorice, can provide a balanced approach to quickening and soothing. When used with ginseng, it can simultaneously attack and tonify, similar to enhancing agricultural production in a prosperous land, enduring initial challenges, thereby hoping for benefits over three years. Currently, even if there are opportunities for quick gains, they should not be pursued, as how could one expect immediate results? The ancient sages have surpassed this understanding.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>When treating initial stages of thirst disease, one should not hastily produce fluids to replenish water or lower heat. Inadequate use of medicine prolongs suffering, which is the physician&#39;s fault. </p>
<p>When treating middle stage of thirst disease, one should not urgently revive the organs tied to metal and water; when the source is exhausted and there are no signs of recovery, this is the physician&#39;s fault. </p>
<p>When treating pulmonary thirst disease, using dihuang pills for blood issues, or using Baihu decoction for kidney issues, if one adheres to a single approach without addressing the whole, the illness cannot be resolved, which is the physician&#39;s fault. </p>
<p>If thirst disease shows little improvement, one should not hastily return to dry and parched conditions, ignoring that the soil is dry and unproductive, leading to the brewing of sores and abscesses without remedy, which is the physician&#39;s fault. </p>
<p>The &quot;Mendong Drink&quot; is suitable for elderly and weak individuals suffering from excessive thirst.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>In treating diabetes, excessive use of cold and cool treatments can overwhelm the body&#39;s fire, even leading to water overpowering fire—a failure to recognize this can result in swelling and fullness beyond recovery, which is the fault of the physician.</p>
<p>The illness of the three types of diabetes is related to the three burners. The upper diabetes, characterized by extreme thirst, leads to constant drinking; this depletes the fluids in the upper burner. It has been said that the disease lies in the lungs, yet it is also due to the heat from the heart and spleen, which can scorch these areas, hence it is also called phlegm diabetes. The middle diabetes pertains to the middle burner, where excessive eating leads to hunger without increasing flesh, resulting in gradual weight loss; this disease is located in the spleen and stomach, also referred to as ingestion diabetes. The lower diabetes concerns the lower burner, where urine is yellow and turbid, sometimes resembling fat or grease, with the face dark and ears scorched, involving gradual weight loss; this ailment is in the kidneys, thus also known as kidney diabetes. </p>
<p>The ancients recognized all three types as manifestations of fire disease, yet there are cases of real fire caused by excess heat, and instances of false fire from insufficient true yin. If one treats diabetes without distinguishing between excess and deficiency, errors are inevitable. Understanding the distinctions of yin and yang in diabetes is crucial. For example, excessive thirst is termed &quot;thirst diabetes,&quot; excessive hunger is termed &quot;grain diabetes,&quot; and turbid urine resembling fat indicates &quot;kidney diabetes.&quot;<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>All of this arises mainly because a strong fire leads to a deficiency of yin, which is a sign of the consumption of yang. However, the meaning of yin consumption is not well understood by many. Consumption refers to both dissolution and depletion. Any decline and failure of the yin-yang, blood, or qi is termed consumption, so one cannot entirely explain it in terms of fire. How can this be demonstrated? For instance, the theory of qi collapse states: &quot;When the heart is influenced by cold in the lungs, it leads to lung consumption; after drinking one or two urinations, death occurs without treatment.&quot; This is precisely due to the decline of foundational qi, leading to coldness in metal and water; thus, water fails to transform into qi, while all qi transforms into water. Isn&#39;t this a manifestation of yin deficiency presenting as a sign of yang? Furthermore, the chapter on pathogenic influences in organs says: &quot;When the pulses of the five organs are thin and small, it signifies consumption and stagnation.&quot; Can one consider these thin pulses as signs of excess yang? This clearly illustrates the concept of yin consumption in the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; which is not well comprehended by people. Therefore, when treating the three signs of consumption, one must observe the pulses and the nature of the disease. If one only notes the deficiency of foundational qi and associated signs of false heat, they must swiftly address the root cause to nourish the source of transformation. Merely recognizing the condition as fire and focusing on clearing it will inevitably result in both yin and yang failing.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>In terms of treatment methods for bodily fluids, the foremost step is to discern between deficiency and excess. If, upon examining the pulse and symptoms, it is confirmed that genuine fire causes the depletion of fluids, then simply removing the fire will allow fluids to regenerate, stopping the thirst. If the issue arises from insufficient true water, this is entirely a matter of yin deficiency, regardless of whether it pertains to the upper, middle, or lower levels. It is crucial to treat the kidneys, ensuring that the yin energy gradually replenishes and the essence and blood recover, thereby letting the illness heal naturally. If one only focuses on clearing fire, there will be no support for yin to generate, and the deterioration will be increasingly apparent, leading to more distress.</p>
<p>Upper consumption leads to excessive thirst, while middle consumption results in excessive hunger. Although it is said that upper consumption pertains to the lungs and middle consumption to the stomach, fundamentally, the fire within the upper and middle burners is merely the stomach fire raging upwards. Therefore, minor distinctions in treatment are necessary. If both burners are indeed affected by excess fire, then White Tiger Decoction is appropriate for both. If there is more thirst than hunger, especially with illness predominantly in the lungs, then Ginseng White Tiger Decoction should be used. If water is deficient in the lower burner and fire is flaming in the upper burner, and there is a need to clear it, then Jade Maiden Decoction or a modified version of One-Yin Decoction should be administered.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>One says: The thirst in the upper burner is caused by the heart fire injuring the metal. It is advisable to lower the fire and clear the metal using ingredients like orchid leaves, white glossy privet flowers, yellow coptis, and anemarrhena, adding a little asarum to guide the clear qi upward and alleviate thirst. This approach can also be appropriately used. </p>
<p>For the symptom of deficiency fire in the middle burner, characterized by being hungry yet thin, the ancient method directly uses formulas like the Stomach Harmonizing and Qi Regulating Decoction and San Huang Wan. However, since there is already good hunger, there should be no stagnation. If there is no stagnation, it is best to clear the fire; it is not suitable to attack the fire. Without symptoms like clumping and obstruction, using these two formulas may not be appropriate. If it is indeed due to stomach fire with no deficiency symptoms, then formulas like San Bu Wan, Yu Quan San, Bai Hu Tang, and Chou Xin Yin can all be considered for use. </p>
<p>For the symptom of lower burner deficiency, where the urination is turbid like grease or oil, and there may be additional symptoms of restlessness and buzzing in the ears, this indicates depletion of kidney water. The ancient method uses formulas like Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to address this, which is indeed appropriate. However, from my observation, it is also necessary to distinguish between cold and heat, slick and turbid, and to treat them accordingly, so as to achieve the best outcome.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>If there is turbid urine like mucus, accompanied by heat and fire, it is advisable to supplement and also clear. One can use a formula such as Yiyin Decotion or Bunyin Pills, Dabu Yinjian, or Liuwei Dihuang Wan with Huangbai and Zhimu. If there is downward leakage and accompanying difficulty in urination, it is necessary to supplement and facilitate, primarily using formulas like Liuwei Dihuang Wan. If there is turbid urine in the lower burner with no fire, it is due to the inability of qi to contain essence, and one should focus on strengthening water and nourishing qi, using formulas like Zuo Gui Yin or Dabu Yuan Jian. If fire diminishes and cannot transform qi, and qi deficiency cannot transform fluids, one should still use formulas like You Gui Yin, You Gui Wan, or Bamei Dihuang Wan. If there is no fire in the lower burner but there is slippage, the main focus should be on consolidating the kidneys and supplementing yin, using formulas like Miyuan Jian, Gu Yin Jian, and Qinzhu Tusi Wan. </p>
<p>Regarding the three types of excesses, ancients categorized the upper burner with the lungs, the middle burner with the stomach, and the lower burner with the kidneys, often treating primarily with fire, which is indeed appropriate. However, in my view, the fire of the three burner&#39;s path often has its disease rooted in the kidneys, and it is invariably related to the vital gate.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>The Gate of Life is the organ of water and fire. When there is a deficiency of water, it can certainly cause consumption and thirst; similarly, when there is a deficiency of fire, it can also lead to consumption and thirst. Why is this the case? It is because when water fails to support fire, fire cannot return to its source. Therefore, fire may wander to the lungs causing upper consumption, or to the stomach causing middle consumption, or it may consume the essence of yin causing lower consumption. These are all manifestations of true yin deficiency and indicate that water is insufficient, leading to consumption.</p>
<p>Moreover, when yang fails to transform qi, water essence cannot be distributed. Water without fire cannot rise but only descend, resulting in direct entry into the bladder causing scanty urination, leading to a depletion of the springs and desiccation of the earth. This too is a manifestation of true yang deficiency, indicative of downwards fire deficiency causing consumption. </p>
<p>For yin deficiency-based consumption, treatment should focus on nourishing water, as has been advised by many. However, when it comes to yang deficiency-induced consumption, people often doubt the need to replenish fire. They do not realize that adding fuel beneath a cauldron enhances the steam, that dried grains gain life from rain, and that growth returns to the peaks—these are all the workings of yang energy and represent subtle balances of life and death. </p>
<p>Because consumption signs are often due to deficiency and cannot withstand excessive depletion, if one does not seek the root causes of this depletion and continues to drain the vital energy, the consumption will worsen and recovery will be impossible. Therefore, I write this again to inform the discerning.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br><strong>Secrets of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Treatment for Diabetes</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of diabetes, although categorized into upper, middle, and lower types, all fundamentally stem from kidney deficiency causing thirst, and there is no difference in this regard. Therefore, the primary method for treating diabetes should focus on nourishing the kidneys, without needing to distinguish between the types. I possess a particularly remarkable formula called &quot;Combined Treatment Decoction.&quot; It consists of three taels of cooked Rehmannia, two taels each of Cornelian cherry and Ophiopogon, five qian of Plantago seeds, and one tael of Yuanshen, boiled in water and consumed daily. This will naturally cure the three types of diabetes. This formula nourishes the kidneys while also addressing excess heat. It seems suitable for those with kidney fire, but one must understand that the symptoms of diabetes cannot materialize without a fire element. I replenish water while reducing fire, allowing the excess heat to exit through the bladder while the true energy remains intact, making recovery from diabetes easier. Why complicate matters by adding more herbs like cinnamon? However, for those who have suffered long-term from diabetes and experience extreme cold in the lower body, this formula may include an additional two qian of cinnamon, if such an abnormal condition arises. If one does not follow my proportions and recklessly adjusts the ingredients, it will lead to swift death—how can one hope for survival? The symptoms of diabetes, although classified into upper, middle, and lower categories, ultimately reflect an insufficiency of kidney water. If one uses fire-clearing and thirst-quenching medications, it will further deplete the yin, inevitably augmenting the fire, which could lead to severe thirst and death. The treatment must focus on replenishing the water within the kidneys; sufficient water will naturally extinguish the fire. However, this fire is not real fire; true fire can be extinguished by cold, while虚火 (fictitious fire) must be drawn out by fire itself.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>One must also replenish the fire in the kidneys, as the fire warms the life gate; when the lower heat is addressed, the upper heat naturally resolves. This prescription is called &quot;Fire-Attracting Yin Decoction,&quot; consisting of two taels of Yuan Shen, two qian each of cinnamon and northern five-flavor fruit, four qian of Shan Zhu Yu, one tael each of cooked earth and Mai Dong, five qian of Ba Ji Tian, all decocted in water for consumption. This formula greatly replenishes the water in the kidneys while warming the fire of the life gate, drawing the fire back to its source and allowing the fire energy to dissipate on its own. It is unnecessary to specifically quench thirst; the thirst will resolve itself, and it is not necessary to specifically subside heat; the heat will heal itself.</p>
<p>For severe thirst, gypsum must be used, often accumulating to a pound over the course of a day and night. When heat is at its extreme, heavy medication is unavoidable. At this time, it is essential to avoid excessive conversation; otherwise, it could be fatal. However, this type of condition is extremely rare, occurring only once in a multitude of cases, and should not be applied indiscriminately to those with general stomach heat.</p>
<p>For severe thirst, using gypsum to calm stomach heat is widely known, yet some may not understand its reason. When stomach heat surges uncontrollably, it is akin to a fire ravaging the wilderness; it requires a torrential rain to dampen and extinguish it. The use of gypsum is thus a temporary measure, often effective in the short term, but it must not be used long term as it leads to ruin.</p>
<p>There is also another formula passed down as a clinical reference. For unceasing severe thirst, use several taels of gypsum, three qian of Zhi Mu, a pinched amount of glutinous rice, three taels of Mai Dong, several taels of Ren Shen, to be used alongside gypsum, with three qian of Ban Xia, one qian of Gan Cao, one hundred pieces of bamboo leaves, and two taels of Yuan Shen, all decocted in water for consumption.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: For diabetes with body heat, yellow and red face, the master is the heart. For diabetes with thirst and a desire to drink, the master is the Chengjiang point. For diabetes, the master is the wrist bone. For yellow edema with a strong thirst in the heat, the master is the Taichong point. For diabetes with good wheezing, where qi runs to the throat and cannot speak, hands and feet are clear, urine is yellow, bowel movement is difficult, there is swelling and pain in the throat, blood in saliva, and the mouth is hot with sticky saliva, the master is the Taixi point. For diabetes and yellow edema, one foot is cold and the other is hot, and the tongue is long and full, the master is the Rangu point. For insufficient yin qi, heat in the middle consuming the grain, with strong hunger, abdominal heat, and mental agitation, the master is the Sanli point. The &quot;Yixue Gangmu&quot; states: For diabetes, take one part of jade fluid, purging until there is blood, take Sanli and purge as before, then replenish one part of jade fluid; take Guanyuan and purge; then take Lianquan. Another method: take Jinjun, Yuye, and Chengjiang continuously, then take Haiquan, Renzhong, Lianquan, Shenxu, and Qihai.

<p>Guidance</p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: for dry mouth, practice the guiding method, rubbing the soles of both feet thirty-six times, and synchronizing inhalation and exhalation at fixed times, swallowing the saliva six times once it returns. Perform circulating motions while holding the tongue against the roof of the mouth, feeling the point of Xuan Yong, allowing a stream of cool water to gradually rise to the mouth for swallowing. Another method: either the water from Yongquan or from the kidneys can be used.</p>
<p>Additionally: visualize cool water below the throat, lifting it to the mouth with intention, by either placing the tongue against the roof or pressing down the tongue against the lower palate, which will generate saliva. This can also raise the kidney water or the spring water. </p>
<p>For thirst, use the guiding method by holding the tongue against the roof, visualizing water rising from the kidneys to wash the back, then coming out from the heart to look at the two feet, imagining the whole body being washed by water.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In ancient times, a certain Hanzi Yufu, over sixty years old and with three ailments, suffered from diabetes. As winter approached, he developed heat and restlessness, needing to uncover himself and spraying his chest and armpits with ice water for relief. He consumed several bowls of meat and noodles daily, quickly feeling hunger again. After more than a month, he sought my treatment. Upon diagnosis, I found his pulse to be deep, thin, and rapid, determining it was a terminal condition. His son Yufu and brother kneeled in front of me, saying: &quot;The illness is indeed serious. Although your efforts may be in vain, we will have no regrets.&quot; I replied: &quot;The condition called diabetes has many names: it is called ‘excessive thirst,’ ‘digestive wasting,’ or ‘exhaustion disease.’ This is caused by an indulgent diet. The yangming transforms into dry fire, which prevents bodily fluids from maintaining, leading to spontaneous sweating and frequent urination. Therefore, drinking leads to urination more than once. Stomach heat causes food to be improperly digested, leading to hunger despite eating, and resulting in weight loss. Shuhe mentions that excessive eating can also cause weakness, which is true. This condition is what Zhongjing referred to as &#39;severe in spring and summer, mild in autumn and winter,&#39; indicating the influence of seasonal changes. Your father is currently worsening as the seasons change, with kidney water depleted and unable to control the excessive heat of the heart at a time of its strength. The classic texts state: &#39;When one cannot control what is usually stronger, it’s called true excess, indicating loneliness of yang without yin.&#39; Furthermore, a person is the master of their body while external forces are temporary guests; this severe winter cannot suppress internal heat. How can any medicine help? The texts say: &#39;The master overcomes the adverse, while the guest follows.&#39; Therefore, treatment would only be futile, so I declined and left. Soon after, a different doctor was consulted, and within a few days, he passed away.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>Zhang Anfu&#39;s wife was forty-five years old, suffering from diabetes, with a cracked red tongue, drinking excessively, and frequently urinating. The previous master treated her with Shengjin Ganlu decoction, resulting in a good recovery. Diabetes often leads to abscesses that cannot be treated; however, in her case, she showed improvement without developing any sores, and she lived to seventy-five years.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Danxi&#39;s Heart Method&quot;: Brother Xu was forty years old, experiencing dry mouth and frequent urination. He developed these symptoms at the end of spring and sought treatment in the summer. Examination of his pulse revealed a weak and thin left pulse and a slightly rapid right pulse, showing strength but slightly heavy. The left pulse was somewhat weak but not thin; however, the weakness was more pronounced on the left, indicating damp heat caused by rich food. He was advised to avoid rich flavors, reduce heat to clear the lungs, and restrain the liver to nourish the spleen, using Sanxiao pills, ten pills, along with five pills each of Zhujin and Awei pills, taken with ginger decoction six times a day. Additionally, he was to take Siwu decoction with added ginseng, atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, sweet licorice, schizandra, and ophiopogon, three times a day, alternating with the pills. After one or two days, he felt much better, with his urination reduced by two-thirds and his mouth not dry; however, his thirst was unchanged, and he experienced dizziness and lower back pain from sitting too long. He thus used a topical remedy for his back pain and continued with the Siwu decoction, reducing the chuanxiong while adding niuxi, schizandra, and roasted huangbo, prepared as a decoction, and took Liu Yi powder as needed. When he noticed frequent urination again, he discontinued the Liu Yi powder but continued with the pills comfortably.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: A man experiences a sensation of fullness in the chest, fever, headache, cough with phlegm, and thirst whenever he engages in labor, with a pulse that is floating and large. This is a condition of spleen and stomach blood deficiency. The spleen, associated with earth, is fundamental for generating blood. He did not believe it and took Er Chen, Huang Lian, Zhi Shi, and Hou Po, but his condition worsened; when he took Si Wu plus Zhi Mu, Bo He, and Mai Dong, he developed abdominal pain and nausea, with a pulse that was surging and rapid, yet erratic. I first used Liu Jun with roasted ginger, and his pain and nausea gradually improved, then treated him with Bu Zhong Yi Qi, leading to complete recovery.</p>
<p>The Chief Administrator Shen used cold medicine at inappropriate times and drank several bowls of ice water daily. The cold remedies only increased his thirst, and he lost weight daily, with a pulse that was surging, large, and rapid, sometimes weak. Wang Taifu said: &quot;If it’s hot but not truly hot, blame it on the lack of fire; if it’s cold but not truly cold, blame it on the lack of water.&quot; He further stated: &quot;Rapidly fluctuating heat indicates a lack of fire; intermittent symptoms indicate a lack of water.&quot; The treatment should focus on tonifying the kidneys, using the modified Eight Flavor Pill, and he recovered within a month.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>At the age of forty-six, during the midsummer, Zhou was excessively overcome by desire, resulting in distressing heat and thirst. He drank water continuously, experienced frequent urination, and had constipation. His saliva was profuse, his face was flushed, his tongue was prickly, and his lips were dry and cracked. He felt heat throughout his body, sometimes like a stabbing pain without a fixed location, and the soles of his feet felt as if they were burnt. Cold treatments provided pain relief, and his pulse was strong and unregulated. This indicated a deficiency of kidney yin, with yang not being anchored and manifesting outwardly, not fire per se. The extreme heat was significant; the cold was insufficient, indicating a lack of water, so he needed to vigorously replenish his yin.</p>
<p>Therefore, he prepared a dose of modified Eight Valuable Herbs Pills weighing one pound, including one tael of cinnamon, and decocted it with water into six bowls, giving him the cool mixture to drink. After consuming half, he had a bowl of warm porridge before sleeping until evening, then took another bowl of the warm decoction and slept until dawn, after which he consumed two bowls of hot porridge, and all symptoms subsided. </p>
<p>The next day, he felt cold, and his feet were cold up to his knees, with symptoms returning; some believed it to be a case of cold damage. However, I said: &quot;It isn&#39;t that. The cold is extreme, yet the heat isn&#39;t actual heat; thus, there is no fire, and yang energy is also deficient.&quot; He urgently took one dose of the Eight Valuable Herbs Pills, which eased him slightly, and after four doses, the symptoms receded again. </p>
<p>When his bowel movements were blocked for thirteen days, he used pig bile to induce them, and symptoms reappeared. Urgently, he took several doses of the Complete Nutritional Decoction, which proved effective.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Medicine&quot; states: In the year of Renxu, a soldier suffered from intense thirst, drinking three dou of water daily. He did not eat for three months and experienced agitation in his heart; it was already October. I believed there was hidden heat in his heart. I prescribed the Dan of Fire Palace, taken in doses of fifty pills each time, swallowed with warm water. After two days, he came to thank me, saying that on that day he took three doses and the thirst subsided; on the following day, he took another three doses, and his eating and drinking returned to normal. This formula is originally for treating lin (dysuria) but is also effective for thirst. Indeed, one must be flexible in the use of medicine.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: A person suffering from intense thirst was near death when someone advised to slice off the ears and roots of glutinous rice stalks, take the heart of the stalk, burn it in a clean vessel to ash, and then take a dose, mixing it with a bowl of water, soaking it for a long time, clarifying the residue, and drinking the clear liquid. The effect was miraculous.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; states: In the capital, there was a man named Zhou Gong from the left side of the mountain, over forty years old. Due to accumulated paperwork and fatigue, he developed a wasting illness, experiencing fatigue, reduced appetite, and frequent fears. From winter through spring to summer, he had not slept a full night for over six months. In his upper body, he experienced no thirst and had little desire for hot water; if he drank a little, it would not move through him. However, every night he had to urinate two to three liters, yet no one knew where it was coming from. His urine was thick as cream, and he was extremely emaciated, certain he would die. I examined him, and although his pulse was still somewhat slow, his flesh had not wasted away completely. It seemed his stomach energy was still present. I used Gui Pi Decoction without wood fragrance, along with other nourishing tonics, one to nourish yang and the other to nourish yin, alternating between them. After more than three hundred doses and about twenty pounds of ginseng, he was fully cured. This is a case of spirit consuming from above and essence diminishing from below. It shows that consumption has both yin and yang, and cannot simply be described as heat.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《易》言天地自太虚至黄泉有六位，《内经》言人之身自头至足亦有六位，今余又言人胸腹之间，自肺至肾又有六位。人与天地造化五行，同一炉锤，知彼则知此矣。故立天之气曰金与火，立地之气曰土与水，立人之气曰风与火。故金与火合则热而清，水土合则湿而寒，风火合则温而炎。人胸腹之间，亦犹是也。肺最在上为金主燥清，心次之为君火主热，肝又次之为风木主温，胆又次之为相火主极热，脾又次之为湿土主凉，肾又次之黄泉为寒水主寒。故心肺象天，脾肾象地，肝胆象人。不知此者，不可与论人之病矣。夫土为万物之本，水为万物之元，水土合德，以阴居阴，同处乎下，以立地为气，万物根于地，是故水土湿寒。若燥热阳实，则地之气不立，万物之根索泽而枝叶枯矣。五常政大论曰：根于中者，命曰神机。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>是为动物根本在于中也。根本者，脾胃肾也。食入胃则脾为布化气味，荣养五脏百骸，故酸入肝而养筋膜，苦入心而养血脉，甘入脾而养肌肉，辛入肺而养皮毛，咸入肾而养骨髓。五气亦然，故清养肺，热养心，温养肝，湿养脾，寒养肾也。凡此五味五气太过则病，不及亦病，惟平则常安矣。故六节脏象论曰：五味入口，藏于肠胃。味有所藏，以养五脏气，气和而生，津液相成，神乃自生。是其理也。又太阴阳明论曰：脾病而四肢不用者何也？岐伯曰：四肢皆禀气于胃，而不得至经。必因于脾肾乃禀也。今脾病不能为胃行其津液，不得禀水谷气，脾日以衰，脉道不利，筋骨肌肉，皆无气以生，故不用焉。帝曰：脾不主时何也？岐伯曰：脾者土也，治中央，常以四时长四脏各十八日寄治，不得独主于时也。脾脏者，常着胃土之精也。<a

<p>　　八卦之中，惟离能烜物；五行之中，惟火能焚物；六气之中，惟火能消物。故火之为用，燔木则消而为炭，焚土则消而为伏龙肝，炼金则消而为汁，煅石则消而为灰，煮水则消而为汤，煎海则消而为盐，干汞则消而为粉，熬锡则消而为丹。故泽中之潦，涸于炎晖；鼎中之水，干于壮火。盖五脏，心为君火正化，肾为君火对化；三焦为相火正化，胆为相火对化。得其平则烹炼饮食，糟粕去焉；不得其平，则燔灼脏腑，而津液竭焉。故入水之物，无物不长；入火之物，无物不消。夫一身之心火甚于上，为膈膜之消；甚于中，为肠胃之消；甚于下，为膏液之消；甚于外，为肌肉之消。<a id="orig-38p" href="#trans-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>上甚而不已，则消及于肺；中甚而不已，则消及于脾；下甚而不已，则消及于肝肾；外甚而不已，则消及于筋骨。四脏皆消尽，则心始自焚而死矣。故《素问》有消瘅、消中、消渴、风消、膈消、肺消之说。消之证不同，归之火则一也。故消瘅者，众消之总名；消中者，善饥之通称；消渴者，善饮之同谓。惟风消、膈消、肺消，此三说不可不分。风消者，二阳之病。二阳者，阳明也。阳明者，胃与大肠也。心受之则血不流，故女子不月；脾受之则味不化，故男子少精，皆不能成隐曲之事。火伏于内，久而不已，为风所鼓，消竭肠胃，其状口干。虽饮水而不咽，此风热格拒于贲门也。口者，病之上源，故病如是。又经曰：二阳结谓之消，此消乃肠胃之消也。其善食而瘦者，名曰食(亻亦)，此消乃肌肉之消也。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>膈消者，心移热于肺，传为膈消。王太仆云：心肺两间，中有斜膈膜，下际内连横膈膜。故心移热于肺，久久传化，内为膈热。消渴多而饮者，此虽肺金受心火之邪，然止是膈消，未及于肺也。故饮水至斗，亦不能止其渴也。其状多饮而数溲，或不数溲，变为水肿者，皆是也。此消乃膈膜之消也。肺消者，心移寒于肺，肺主气。经曰：饮食入胃，游溢精气，上输于脾，脾之精气，上归于肺，通调水道，下输膀胱，水精四布，五经并行，以为常也。《灵枢》亦曰：上焦如雾，中焦如沤，下焦如渎。<a id="orig-40p" href="#trans-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>今心为阳火，先受阳邪，阳火内郁，火郁内传，肺金受制，火与寒邪皆来乘肺，肺外为寒所薄，阳气得施，内为火所燥，亢极水复，故皮肤索泽而(疒帬)着，溲溺积热而频并，上饮半升，下行十合，故曰饮一溲二者死。膈消不为寒所薄，阳气得宜散于外，故可治。肺消为寒所薄，阳气自溃于中，故不可治。此乃消及于肺脏者也。又若脾风传之肾，名曰疝瘕。少腹冤热而痛，出白液，名曰蛊。王太仆云：消烁脂肉，如虫之蚀，日渐损削，此消乃膏液之消也。故后人论三焦指以为肾消，此犹可治，人则变瘈，不救必死。此消乃消及于肾脏者也。夫消者必渴，渴亦有三：有甘之渴，有石之渴，有火燥之渴。肥者令人内热，甘者令人中满，其气上溢，转为消渴。经又曰：味厚者发热。《灵枢》亦曰：咸走血，多食之，令人渴。咸入于胃中，其气上走中焦，注于肺则血气走之，血与咸相得，侧凝干而善渴。血脉者，中焦之道也。此皆肥甘之渴。<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>夫石药之气悍，适足滋热，与热气相遇，必内伤脾。此药石之渴也。阳明司天，四之气，嗌干引饮。此心火为寒水所郁故然。少阳司天，三之气，炎暑至，民病渴。太阳司天，甚则渴而欲饮，水行凌火，火气鬱故然。少阴之复，渴而欲饮，少阳之复，嗌络焦槁，渴引水浆，色变黄赤。又伤寒五日，少阴受之，故口燥舌干而渴。肾热病者，苦渴数饮。此皆燥热之渴也。故膏粱之人，多肥甘之渴、石药之渴；藜藿奔走之人，多燥热之渴。二者虽殊，其实一也。故火在上者，善渴；火在中者，消谷善饥；火在上中者，善渴多饮而数溲；火在中下者，不渴而溲白液；火遍上中下者，饮多而数溲，此其别也。后人断消渴为肾虚，水不胜火则是也。<a id="orig-42p" href="#trans-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>其药则非也何哉？以八味丸治渴，水未能生而火反助也。此等本不知书，妄引王太仆之注，益火之源以消阴翳，壮水之主以制阳光。但益心之阳，寒热通行，强肾之阴，热之犹可，岂知王太仆之意以寒热而行之也。肾本恶燥，又益之以火可乎？今代刘河间自制神芎丸，以黄芩味苦入心，牵牛、大黄驱火气而下，以滑石引入肾经。此方以牵牛、滑石为君，以大黄、黄芩为臣，以芎、连、薄荷为使，将离入坎，其得黄庭之秘旨也。而又以人参白朮汤、消痞丸，大人参散、碧玉、鸡苏散数法以调之，故治消渴最为得体。昔有消渴者，日饮数升，先生以生姜自然汁一盆，置之密室中，具罂杓于其间，使其人入室，从而锁其门，病人渴甚，不得已而饮汁尽，渴减。此《内经》辛以润之之旨。<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>《内经》治渴，以兰除其陈气，亦辛平之剂也。先生之汤剂，虽用此一味，亦必有旁药助之。初虞世曰：凡渴疾未发疮疡，便用大黄寒药利其势，使大困大虚自胜，如发疮疡脓血流漓而飧泄，此真俗言也。故巴郡太守以三黄丸能治消渴。余尝以隔数年不愈者，减去(石卜)硝，加黄连一斤，大作剂，以长流千里水，煎五七沸，放冷，日呷之数百次；以桂苓甘露散、白虎汤、生藕节汁、淡竹沥、生地黄汁，相间服之，大作剂料，以代饮水，不日而痊。故消渴一证，调之而不下则小润。小濡固不能杀炎上之势，下之而不调，亦旋饮旋消，终不能沃膈膜之干。下之调之而不减滋味，不戒嗜欲，不节喜怒，病已而复作。能从此三者，消渴亦不足忧矣。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>况《灵枢》又说心脉滑为善渴；经又曰滑者阳气胜；又言五脏脉，心脉微小为消瘅；又言五脏脆为消瘅；又言消瘅之人，薄皮肤而肉坚固以深，长冲直扬，其心刚，刚者多怒，怒则气逆上，胸中蓄积，血气逆流髋皮，充肌肉，脉不行，转而为热，热则消肌肤，故为消瘅；又言五脏皆柔弱者，善病消瘅。夫柔弱者必有刚强，刚强者多怒，柔弱者易伤也。余以是遂悟气逆之人，非徒病消渴。若寒薄其外，亦为痈肿、少气、狂、膈中、肺消、涌水者；热客其脏，则亦为惊、衄、膈消、柔痓、虚肠澼死；客其腑，则为癃、溺血、口糜、虙瘕为沉、食(亻亦)、辛頞、鼻渊、衄、蔑、瞑目。盖此二十一证，皆在气厥论中。经曰：诸逆冲上，皆属于火。一言可了，善读书者，以是求之。<br>　　　　东垣十书 【元　李杲】<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p>

<p>　　三消得之气之实血之虚也，久久不治，气极虚则无能为力矣。有一僧专用黄芪饮加减，其论盖详以益血为主。三消，小便去多。上消消心，心火炎上，大渴而小便多。中消消脾，脾气热燥，饮食倍常，皆消为小便。下消消肾，肾衰不能摄水，故小便虽多而不渴。然小便既多，津液必竭，久而未有不渴者，谓之全不渴，未为的论。诸消不宜用燥烈峻补之剂，惟当滋养。除消脾外，心肾二消宜用黄芪饮吞八味丸或元菟丹或小菟丝子丸。又竹龙散皆可用。又六神饮亦治肾消，惟脾消则加当归去黄芪。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>三消小便既多，大便必秘，宜常服四物汤润其大肠，如加人参、木瓜、花粉在内，仍煮四皓粥食之，糯米泔淅二亦可冷进。　　三消人而小便不臭，反作甜气，在溺桶中滚涌，其病为重。更有浮在溺面如猪脂，溅在桶边如柏烛泪，此精不禁，真元竭矣。　　上消中消，心脾既如此热，小便濇少而反无禁，盖燥热在上，虚冷在下，阴阳不交，所以成消渴。　　三消久之，精血既亏，或目无见，或手足偏废如风疾，非风也，此证消肾得之为多。消心之病，往往因欲饮食过多，及食啖辛热。引饮既多，小便亦多，当抑心火，使之下降，自然不渴，宜半夏泻心汤去干姜盏加(艹舌)蒌、干葛如其数，吞猪肚丸或酒连丸，仍佐独味黄连汤，多煎候冷，遇渴恣饮，久而自愈；或用糯米煮稀粥，然同颖汤、梅花汤二药，于三消有渴者皆可用。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>若因用心过度，致心火炎上，渴而消者，宜黄芪饮加莲肉、远志各半钱，吞元菟丹；仍以大麦煎汤，间下灵砂丹。　　消脾，缘脾经燥热，食物易化，皆为小便，转食转饥。然脾消又自有三：曰消中，曰寒中，曰热中，宜用莲茗饮加生地黄、干葛各半钱，或乌金散，或止用莲茗饮。　　若因色欲过度，水火不交，肾水下泄，心火自焚，以致渴者，不宜备用凉心冷剂，宜坚肾水以济心火，当用黄芪饮加苁蓉、五味各半钱，吞八味丸及小菟丝子丸，元菟丹、鹿茸丸、加减安肾丸，皆可选用，或灵砂丹。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>消肾为病，比诸消为重，古方谓之强中，又谓之内消，多因恣意色欲，或饵金石，肾气既衰，石气独在，精水无所养，故常发虚，阳不交精出，小便无度，唇口干焦，黄芪饮吞元菟丹，八味丸、鹿茸丸、加减肾气丸、小菟丝子丸、灵砂丹，皆可选用。或未效，黄芪饮加苁蓉、北五味、山茱萸各四分、荠笼丸、苁蓉丸。　　三消之外，又有果木渴，因多食果子所致，宜麝香之药。　　诸病中有渴，已各见本证。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>今特举其无病自渴，与病瘥后渴者，参朮散、四君子汤、缩脾汤，或七珍散加木瓜一钱，皆可选用。生料五苓散加人参一钱名春泽汤，以五苓散和四君子汤亦名春泽汤，尤是要药，更兼作四皓粥食之。　　诸病久损，肾虚而渴，宜八味丸、黄芪饮、四物汤加人参、木瓜各半钱，或七珍饮、大补汤去朮加木瓜如数。　　诸失血及产妇蓐中渴者，名曰血渴，宜求益血之剂，已于本证中论之。　　有无病忽然大渴，少顷又定，只宜蜜汤及缩脾汤之类，淅二泔冷进数口亦可。　　酒渴者，干葛调五苓散。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p>

<p>　　　　　消渴</p>
<p>　　上消者，经所谓之膈消。膈消者，渴而多饮是也。中消者，经谓之消中。消中者，渴而饮食俱多，或不渴而独饮是也。下消者，经谓之肾消。肾消者，饮一溲二，其溲如膏油，即膈消、消中之传变。王注谓：肺脏消铄，气无所持是也。盖肺藏气，肺无病则气能管摄津液，而津液之精微者，收养筋骨血脉，余者为溲。肺病则津液无气管摄，而精微者亦随溲下，故饮一溲二，而溲如膏油也。筋骨血脉，无津液以养之，故其病渐成形瘦焦干也。然肺病本于肾虚，肾虚则心寡于畏，妄行凌肺，而移寒与之，然后肺病消。故仲景治渴而小便反多，用肾气丸补肾救肺，后人因名之肾消及下消也。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>　　或曰：经既云肺消死不治，仲景复用肾气丸治之，何也？曰：饮一溲二者，死不治。若饮一未至溲二者，病尚浅，犹或可治。故仲景肾气丸，治饮水一斗、小便亦一斗之证。若小便过于所饮者，亦无及矣。　　饮食不节，劳倦所伤，以致脾胃虚弱，乃血所生病，主口中津液不行，故口干咽干，病人自以为渴，医以五苓散治之，反加渴燥，乃重竭津液以致危亡。经云：虚则补其母。当于心与小肠中补之。乃脾胃之根蒂也，以甘温之药为之主，以苦寒为之使，以酸为之臣佐。以心苦缓，急食酸以收之；心火旺则肺金受邪，金虚则以酸补之；次以甘温及甘寒之剂，于脾胃中泻心火之亢盛，是治其本也。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>　　　　医学入门 【明　李梴】</p>

<p>　　上消者，舌上赤裂，大渴引饮。逆调论云：心移热于肺，传为膈消者是也。以白虎汤加人参治之。中消者，善食而瘦，自汗，大便鞕，小便数。叔和云：口干饮水，多食肌虚瘅成消中者是也。以调胃承气汤治之。下消者，烦躁引饮，耳轮焦干，小便如膏。叔和云：焦烦水易亏，此肾消也。六味丸治之。古人治三焦之法，详别如此，余又有一说焉。人之水火得其平，气血得其养，何消之有？其间摄养失宜，水火偏胜，津液枯槁，以致龙雷之火上炎，熬煎既久，肠胃合消，五脏干燥，令人四肢瘦削，精神倦怠。故治消之法，无分上中下，先治肾为急。惟六味、八味及加减八味丸，随证而服，降其心火，滋其肾水，而渴自止矣。白虎与承气，皆非所治也。　　《总录》谓：不能食而渴者，末传中满；能食而渴者，必发脑疽背痈。盖不能食者脾之病，脾土浇濯四旁，与胃行其津液者也。脾胃既虚，则不能敷布其津液，故渴。其间纵有能食者，亦是胃虚引谷自救。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>若概用寒凉泻火之药，如白虎、承气之类，则内热未除，中寒复生，能不末传鼓胀耶？惟七味白朮散、人参生脉散之类，恣意多饮，复以八味地黄丸滋其化源，才是治法。及能食而渴，发疽者，乃肥贵人膏粱之疾也。数食甘美而肥多，故其上气转溢而为消渴。不可服膏粱芳草石药，其气慓悍，能助燥热。经曰：治之以兰，除陈气也。亦不用寒凉及发痈疽者，何也？经曰：膏粱之变，饶生大疔。此之谓也。<a id="orig-65p" href="#trans-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>其肾消而亦有脑疽背痈者，盖肾主骨，脑者肾之海，背者太阳经寒水所过之地，水涸海竭，阴火上炎，安得不发而为痈疽也？其疮甚而不溃，或赤水者是，甚则或黑或紫，火极似水之象，乃肾水已竭，不治。或峻补其阴，亦可救也。　　或曰：人有服地黄汤而渴仍不止者，何也？曰：此方士不能废其绳墨而更其道也。盖心肺位近，宜制小其服；肾肝位远，宜制大其服。如高消中消，可以前丸缓而治之。若下消已极，大渴大燥，须加减八味丸料一升，内肉桂一两，水煎六七碗，恣意冰冷饮之，熟睡而渴病如失矣。处方之制，存乎人之通变耳。　　或问曰：下消无水，用六味地黄丸，可以滋少阴之肾水矣，又加附子、肉桂者何？盖因命门火衰，不能蒸腐水谷，水谷之气，不能熏蒸上润乎肺，如釜底无薪，锅盖干燥，故渴。<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>至于肺亦无所禀，不能四布水精，并行五经，其所饮之水，未经火化，直入膀胱，正谓饮一升溺一升，饮一斗溺一斗，试尝其味，甘而不咸可知矣。故用附子、肉桂之辛热，壮其少火，灶底加薪，枯笼蒸溽，槁禾得雨，生意维新，惟明者知之，昧者鲜不以为迂也。昔汉武帝病渴，张仲景为处此方，至圣元关，今犹可想。八味丸诚良方也。疮疽痊后，及将痊口渴甚者，舌黄坚硬者；及未患先渴，或心烦躁渴，小便频数，或白浊阴痿，饮食少思，肌肤消瘦，及腿肿脚瘦，口齿生疮，服之无不效。<a id="orig-67p" href="#trans-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>　　一贵人病疽，疾未安而渴作，一日饮水数升，愚遂献加减地黄方。诸医大笑云：此药若能止渴，我辈当不复业医矣。皆用木瓜、紫苏、乌梅、人参、茯苓、百药煎等生津液之药止之，而渴愈甚。数剂之后，茫无功效。不得已而用前方，三日渴止。因相信久服，不特渴疾不作，气血亦壮，饮食加倍，强健过于少壮之年。盖用此药，非予敢自执鄙见，实有源流。薛氏家藏此方，屡用有验，故详着之，使有渴疾者，信其言，专志服饵取效，无为庸医所惑，庶广前人之志。久服轻身，耳目聪明，令人光泽。<a id="orig-68p" href="#trans-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>盖内北五味最为得力，独能补肾水，平补降心气。其肉桂一味不可废，若去肉桂，服亦不应。　　一男子患此，欲治以前丸，彼谓肉桂性热，乃易黄蘗、知母等药。渴不止，发背疽而殁。夫肉桂，肾经药也。前证乃肾经虚火炎上，无制为患，用桂导引诸药以补之，及引虚火归元，故效。成无己云：桂尤圭也，引导阳气，若执以使。　　若夫上消者，谓心移热于肺；中消者，谓内虚胃热。皆认火热为害，故或以白虎，或以承气，卒致不救。<a id="orig-69p" href="#trans-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>总之是下焦命门，火不归元，游于肺则为上消，游于胃即为中消，以八味肾气丸引火归元，使火在釜底，水火既济，气上熏蒸，肺受湿气而渴疾愈矣。　　有一等渴欲引饮，但饮水不过一二口即厌，少顷复渴，饮亦不过若此，但不若消渴者饮水无厌也。此是中气虚寒，寒水泛上，逼其浮游之火，于咽喉口舌之间，故上焦一段，欲得水救，若到中焦，以水见水，正其所恶也。治法：如面红烦躁者，理中汤送八味丸。　　又有一等渴欲饮水，但饮下少顷即吐出，吐出少顷复求饮，药食毫不能下，此是阴盛格阳，肾经伤寒之证。仲景以白通加人尿、胆汁，热药冷探之法，一服即愈。女人多有此证。<a id="orig-70p" href="#trans-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>　　　　医门法律 【清　喻昌】</p>
<p>　　　　　消渴论</p>
<p>　　消渴之患，常始于微而成于着，始于胃而极于肺肾。始如以水沃焦，水入犹能消之；既而以水投石，水去而石自若。至于饮一溲一，饮一溲二，则燥火劫其真阴，操立尽之术，而势成熇熇矣。《内经》有其论无其治，《金匮》有论有治矣。而集书者，采《伤寒论》厥阴经消渴之文凑入，后人不能决择，斯亦不适于用也。盖伤寒传经，热邪至厥阴而尽，热势入深，故渴而消水，及热解则不渴且不消矣，岂杂证积渐为患之比乎？谨从《内经》拟议言之。经谓凡治消瘅、仆击、偏枯、痿厥、气满发逆，肥贵人则膏粱之疾也，此中消所由来也。肥而不贵，食弗给于鲜。贵而不肥，餐弗过于饕。<a id="orig-71p" href="#trans-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>肥而且贵，醇酒厚味，熟为限量哉？久之，食饮酿成内热，津液干涸，求济于水。然水入尚能消之也，愈消愈渴，其膏粱愈无已，而中消之病遂成矣。夫既瘅成为中消，随其或上或下，火热炽盛之区，以次传入矣。上消者，胃以其热，上输于肺，而子受母累。心复以其热，移之于肺，而金受火刑。金者，生水而出高源者也。饮入胃中，游溢精气而上，则肺通调水道而下，今火热入之，高源之水为暴虐所逼，合外饮之水，建瓴而下，饮一溲二，不但不能消外水，且并素蕴水精，竭绝而尽输于下，较大腑之暴注暴泄，尤为甚矣。故死不治也。所谓由心之肺谓之死阴，死阴之属，不过三日而死者，此之谓也。故饮一溲二，第一危候也。<a id="orig-72p" href="#trans-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>至于胃以其热由关门下传于肾，肾或以石药耗其真，女谒竭其精者，阳强于外，阴不内守，而小溲浑浊如膏，饮一溲一，肾消之证成矣。经谓石药之性悍，又谓脾风传之肾名曰疝瘕，少腹冤热而痛，出白液，名曰蛊。明指肾消为言。医和有云：女子阳物也，晦淫则生内热惑蛊之疾。此解冤热及蛊义甚明。王太仆谓：消烁肌肉，如蛊之蚀，日渐损削，乃从消字起见，浅矣浅矣。夫惑女色以丧志，精泄无度，以至水液浑浊，反从火化，亦最危候。经云：君火之下，阴精承之。故阴精有余，足以上承心火，则其人寿；阴精不足，心火直下肾中，阳精所降，其人夭矣。故肾者胃之关也，关门不开则水无输泄而为肿满，关门不闭则水无底止而为消渴。消渴属肾一证，《金匮》原文未脱，其曰饮一斗，溲一斗者，肾气丸主之。<a id="orig-73p" href="#trans-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>于是蒸动精水，上承君火，而止其下入之阳光，此正通天手眼，张子和辄敢诋之。既诋仲景，复谀河间，谓其神芎丸以黄芩味苦入心，牵牛大黄驱火气而下，以滑石引入肾经，将离入坎，真得黄庭之秘。颠倒其说，阿私所好，识趣卑陋若此，又何足以入仲景之门哉？何柏斋《消渴论》中，已辨其非。昌观戴人吐下诸案中，从无有治消渴一案者，可见无其事即无其理矣。篇首论火一段，非不有其理也。然以承气治壮火之理施之，消渴又无其事矣。故下消之火，水中之火也，下之则愈燔。中消之火，竭泽之火也，下之则愈伤。上消之火，燎原之火也，水从天降可灭。徒攻肠胃，无益反损。夫地气上为云，然后天气下为雨，是故雨出地气。地气不上，天能雨乎？故亟升地气以慰三农，与亟升肾气以溉三焦，皆事理之必然者耳。不与昔贤一为分辨，后人亦安能行其所明哉？<a id="orig-74p" href="#trans-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>　　　　　续论</p>
<p>　　昌着消渴论，聊会《内经》大意，谓始于胃而极于肺肾，定为中上下之三消。其他膈消、食(亻亦)等证，要亦中上之消耳。然未得《金匮》之实据，心恒不慊。越二岁，忽忆《内经》云：有所劳倦，形气衰少，谷气不盛，上焦不行，胃气热，热气熏胸中，故内热。恍然悟胸中受病消息，唯是胃中水谷之气，与胸中天真灌注环周，乃得清明在躬。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>若有所劳倦，伤其大气宗气，则胸中之气衰少，胃中谷气因而不盛，谷气不盛，胸中所伤之气，愈益难复，而不能以充行，于是谷气留于胃中，胃中郁而为热，热气熏入胸中，混合其衰少之气，变为内热，胸胃间不觉易其冲和之旧矣，求其不消不渴宁可得乎？透此一关，读《金匮》所不了了者，今始明之。其云：寸口脉浮而迟，浮即为虚，数即为劳，虚则卫气不足，劳则荣气竭；趺阳脉浮而数，浮则为气，数则消谷而大坚，气盛则溲数，溲数则坚，坚数相搏，即为消渴。举寸口以候胸中之气，举趺阳以候胃中之气，显然有脉之可循，显然有证之可察，然且难解其微焉。盖阴在内，为阳之守；阳在外，为阴之固。寸口脉浮，阴不内守，故外卫之阳浮即为虚也；寸口脉迟，阳不外固，故内守之阴迟即为劳也。总因劳伤荣卫，致寸口脉虚而迟也。然营者水谷之精气，卫者水谷之悍气，虚而且迟，水谷之气不上充而内郁，已见膈虚胃热之一斑矣。<a id="orig-76p" href="#trans-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>更参以趺阳脉之浮数，浮则为气，即《内经》热气熏胸中之变文，数则消谷而大坚。昌前论中既如以水投石，水去而石自若，偶合胃中大坚，消谷不消水之象，可见火热本足消水也，水入本足救渴也。胃中坚燥，全不受水之浸润，转从火热之势，急奔膀胱，故溲数。溲去其内愈燥，所以坚数相搏，即为消渴。直引《内经》味过于苦，久从火化，脾气不濡，胃气乃厚之意，为消渴之源，精矣微矣。晋唐以后，代不乏贤，随其聪敏，揣摩《内经》，各自名家，卒皆不入仲景堂奥，其所得于《内经》者浅耳。使深则能随证比类，各出脉证方治，以昭成法，而《金匮》遗编，家传户诵之矣。<a id="orig-77p" href="#trans-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>即如消渴证，相沿谓中消者宜下之，共守一语，更无别商，岂一下可了其局乎？抑陆续徐下之乎？夫胃已大坚，不受膏沐，辄投承气，坚者不受瑕者受之矣，膀胱不受大肠受之矣，岂不乘其药势，传为利下鹜溏中满肿胀之证乎？《总录》谓：末传能食者必发脑疽背疮，不能食者必传中满鼓胀，皆为不治之证。诸家不亟亟于始传中传，反于末传，多方疗治，如忍冬、蓝叶、荠苨丸散，及紫苏、葶苈中满分消汤丸，欲何为耶？《金匮》于小溲微觉不利，早用文蛤一味治之，方书从不录用。讵知软坚之品，非劫阴即伤阴，独此一种，平善无过，兼可利水，诚足宝乎！洁古谓：能食而渴者，白虎加人参汤。不能食而渴者，钱氏白朮散加葛根。末传疮疽者，火邪盛也，急攻其阳，无攻其阴。下焦元气，得强者生，失强者死。<a id="orig-78p" href="#trans-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>末传中满者，高消中消制之太过，速过病所，上热未除，中寒复起，非药之罪，用药时失其缓急之制也。洁古老人可谓空谷足音矣。所云无攻其阴，得强者生，失强者死，皆虑泉竭之微言，令人耸然起敬。于是追步后尘，徐商一语曰：三消总为火病，岂待末传疮疽，始为火邪胜耶？然火之在阳在阴，分何脏腑，合何脏腑，宜升宜降，宜折宜伏，各各不同，从其性而治之，使不相扞格，乃为良法。若不治其火，但治其热，火无所归，热宁有止耶？如肾消，阴病用六味丸，阳病用八味丸，此亦一法。若谓下消只此一法，其去中消宜下之说能以寸哉！　　《内经》阴阳别论曰：二阳结谓之消。<a id="orig-79p" href="#trans-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>二阳者，阳明也。手阳明大肠主津，病消则目黄口干，是津不足也。足阳明胃主血，病热则消谷善饥，血中伏火、乃血不足也。结者津血不足，结而不行，皆燥之为病也。　　《内经》曰：心移热于肺，传为膈消。张子和谓膈消犹未及于肺，至心移寒于肺，乃为肺消，如此泥文害意，非能读《内经》者也。岂有心移热于肺，肺传其热于膈，犹未及肺之理？必变经文为心移热于膈，传为肺消，乃不泥乎？要识心肺同居膈上，肺为娇脏，移寒移热，总之易入，但寒邪入而外束，热邪入而外传，均一肺梢，而治则有分矣。　　刘河间论三消之疾，本湿寒之阴气极衰，燥热之阳气太甚，六气中已遗风火二气矣。<a id="orig-80p" href="#trans-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>且以消渴、消中、消肾，分名三消，岂中下二消，无渴可言耶？及引经言有心肺气厥而渴，有肝痹而渴，有痹热而渴，有胃与大肠结热而渴，有脾痹而渴，有肾热而渴，有小肠痹热而渴，愈推愈泛，其不合论消渴，但举渴之一端，为燥热亡液之验，诚不可解。《玉机微义》深取其说，发暖药补肾之误，吾不知暖药果为何药也。世岂有以暖药治消渴之理哉？其意盖在非《金匮》之主肾气丸耳。夫肾气丸蒸动肾水，为治消渴之圣药，后世咸知之，而何柏斋复辨之。昌恐后学偶阅子和、宗厚之说，反滋疑眩，故再陈之。　　瘅成为消中，胃热极深，胃火极炽，以故能食易饥多渴，诸家咸谓宜用大承气汤下之矣。不知积渐之热，素蕴之火，无取急下，下之亦不去，徒伤肠胃，转增其困耳。<a id="orig-81p" href="#trans-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>故不得已而用大黄，当久蒸以和其性，更不可合枳实、厚朴同用，助其疾趋之势。洁古用本方更其名曰顺利散，隐然取顺利不取攻劫之意。方下云：治中消热在胃而能食，小便赤黄微利，至不欲食为效，不可多利。昌恐微利至不欲食，胃气已不存矣。承气非微利之法而可渎用乎？子和更其方为加减三黄丸，合大黄、芩、连用之，不用枳、朴矣。方下云：治丹石毒及热渴。以意测度，须大实者方用，曾不思消渴证真气为热火所耗，几见有大实之人耶？然则欲除胃中火热，必如之何而后可？昌谓久蒸大黄，与甘草合用则急缓互调，与人参合用则攻补兼施，如充国之屯田金城，坐困先零，庶几可图三年之艾。目前纵有乘机斗捷之着，在所不举，如之何欲取效眉睫耶？昔贤过矣。　　律五条<a id="orig-82p" href="#trans-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>　　凡治初得消渴病，不急生津补水，降火彻热，用药无当，迁延误人，医之罪也。　　凡治中消病成，不急救金水二脏，泉之竭矣，不云自中，医之罪也。　　凡治肺消病，而以地黄丸治其血分，肾消病而以白虎汤治其气分，执一不通，病不能除，医之罪也。　　凡消渴病少愈，不急回枯泽槁，听其土燥不生，致酿疮疽无救，医之罪也。　　门冬饮子易老　治老弱虚人大渴。<a id="orig-83p" href="#trans-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>　　凡治消渴病，用寒凉太过，乃至水胜火湮，犹不知反，渐成肿满不救，医之罪也。<br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>
<p>　　　　　论证</p>
<p>　　三消之病，三焦受病也。上消者，渴证也，大渴引饮，随饮随渴，以上焦之津液枯涸，古云其病在肺，而不知心脾阳明之火，皆能熏炙而然，故又谓之膈消也。　　中消者，中焦病也，多食善饥，不为肌肉而日加削瘦，其病在脾胃，又谓之消中也。　　下消者，下焦病也，小便黄赤，为淋为浊，如膏如脂，面黑耳焦，日渐消瘦，其病在肾，故又名肾消也。此三消者，古人悉认为火证，然有实火者，以邪热有余也；有虚火者，以真阴不足也。使治消证而不辨虚实，则未有不误者矣。　　消证有阴阳，尤不可不察。如多渴者曰消渴，善饥者曰消谷，小便淋浊如膏者曰肾消。<a id="orig-84p" href="#trans-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>凡此者，多由于火盛则阴虚，是皆阳消之证也。至于阴消之义，则未有知之者。盖消者，消烁也，亦消耗也。凡阴阳血气之属，日见消败者，皆谓之消，故不可尽以火证为言。何以见之？如气厥论曰：心移寒于肺为肺消，饮一溲二，死不治。此正以元气之衰，而金寒水冷，故水不化气，而气悉化水，岂非阳虚之阴证乎？又如邪气脏腑病形篇言：五脏之脉细小者皆为消瘅。岂以微小之脉而为有余之阳证乎？此《内经》阴消之义，固已显然言之，而但人所未审耳。故凡治三消证者，必当察其脉气病气形气，但见本元亏损，及假火等证，必当速救根本以资化源。若但知为火而专务清理，未有不阴阳俱败者矣。<a id="orig-85p" href="#trans-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　凡治消之法，最当先辨虚实。若察其脉证，果为实火致耗津液者，但去其火，则津液自生而消渴自止。若由真水不足，则悉属阴虚，无论上中下，急宜治肾，必使阴气渐充，精血渐复，则病必自愈。若但知清火，则阴无以生，而日见消败，益以困矣。　　上消善渴，中消善饥。虽曰上消属肺，中消属胃，然总之火在上中二焦者，亦无非胃火上炎而然，但当微为分别以治之。若二焦果由实火，则皆宜白虎汤主之。若渴多饥少，病多在肺者，宜人参白虎汤主之。若水亏于下，火炎于上，有不得不清者，宜玉女煎或加减一阴煎之类主之。<a id="orig-86p" href="#trans-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>一云：上焦渴，是心火刑金所致，宜降火清金，以兰香叶、白葵花、黄蘗、知母，少加升麻，以引清气上升而渴自止，此说亦可酌用。　　中消火证，以善饥而瘦，古法直以调胃承气汤及三黄丸之类主之。然既已善饥，其无停积可知。既无停积，则止宜清火，岂堪攻击？非有干结不通等证，而用此二剂，恐非所宜。若其果属胃火，别无虚证，宜三补丸、玉泉散、白虎汤及抽薪饮之类，皆可择而用也。　　下消证，小便淋浊如膏如油，或加烦躁耳焦，此肾水亏竭之证。古法用六味地黄丸之类主之，固其宜矣。然以余观之，则亦当辨其寒热滑濇，分而治之，庶乎尽善。<a id="orig-87p" href="#trans-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>若淋浊如膏，兼热病而有火者，宜补而兼清，以加减一阴煎或补阴丸、大补阴丸，或六味地黄丸加黄蘗、知母之类主之。若下消而兼濇者，宜补宜利，以六味地黄丸之类主之。若下焦淋浊而全无火者，乃气不摄精而然，但宜壮水养气，此左归饮、大补元煎之类主之。若火衰不能化气，气虚不能化液者，犹当以右归饮、右归丸、八味地黄丸之类主之。若下焦无火而兼滑者，当以固肾补阴为主，宜秘元煎、固阴煎及芩朮菟丝丸之类主之。　　三消证，古人以上焦属肺，中焦属胃，下焦属肾，而多从火治，是固然矣。然以余论之，则三焦之火，多有病本于肾，而无不由乎命门者。<a id="orig-88p" href="#trans-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>夫命门为水火之腑，凡水亏证，固能为消为渴，而火亏证，亦能为消为渴者，何也？盖水不济火则火不归原，故有火游于肺而为上消者，有火游于胃而为中消者，有火烁阴精而为下消者，是皆真阴不足，水亏于下之消证也。　　又有阳不化气则水精不布，水不得火则有降无升，所以直入膀胱而饮一溲二，以致泉源不滋，天壤枯涸者，是皆真阳不足，火亏于下之消证也。阴虚之消，治宜壮水，固有言之者矣。阳虚之消，谓宜补火，则人必不信。不知釜底加薪，氤氲彻顶，槁禾得雨，生意归巅，此无他，皆阳气之使然也，亦生杀之微权也。余因消证多虚，难堪剥削，若不求其斫丧之因，而再伐生气，则消者愈消，无从复矣。故再笔于此，用以告夫明者。<a id="orig-89p" href="#trans-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>

<p>[Note: The essence and energy of the five organs are all deficient, transforming into heat. The heat consumes the muscles, causing consumption. A full and large pulse indicates that the essence and blood are still abundant, thus it can be treated. A weak and thin pulse indicates a gradual decline in essence and energy, making treatment difficult.]</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>When the heart&#39;s coldness moves to the lungs, the lungs consume. If the lungs consume, drinking does not help, and death is inevitable. </p>
<p>[Note: The lungs are the source of metal and water. Coldness from heart fire diminishes lung essence, so drinking does not help, leading to death as there is no remedy.]</p>
<p>When the heart&#39;s heat moves to the lungs, this causes diaphragm consumption.</p>
<p>[Note: The heart and lungs are situated above the diaphragm; when fire heat transfers to the lung metal, the fluid of metal and water gets depleted, leading to exhaustion of the fluids above the diaphragm, causing thirst.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treating Heat</strong></p>
<p>In cases of kidney heat illness, there is first pain in the lower back and aching kidneys, intense thirst, frequent drinking, and body heat. </p>
<p>[Note: The lower back is the area of the kidneys, hence the pain here first. The kidneys govern the bones, thus the aching. The kidneys are water organs; when fluids cannot ascend, it leads to intense thirst and frequent drinking.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang Differences</strong></p>
<p>The convergence of two Yangs is called consumption. </p>
<p>[Note: The two Yangs refer to the Yangming stomach. When Yangming qi is obstructed, the fluids from food and water do not produce, leading to thirst as a result.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Strange Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What is the name of the illness characterized by a sweet mouth? How does one contract it?&quot; Qibo replied, &quot;This is an overflow of the five vital energies, known as &#39;spleen dampness.&#39; When five flavors enter the stomach, they are stored there, and the spleen facilitates the movement of their essence and energy. The fluids in the spleen cause the mouth to taste sweet, indicating an abundance of richness. Such individuals often consume sweet and rich foods. Excessive richness leads to internal heat, while sweetness causes fullness, hence their energy overflows and turns into diabetes. Treat this with orchid, to disperse the stagnant qi.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Essential Truths</strong></p>
<p>For the Shaoyang recovery, the throat is parched and dry, leading to thirst for liquids. The throat&#39;s dryness indicates damage to the lung’s metal element.

The Taiyang governs the heavens, causes the throat to dry and parched, and if severe, the complexion flushes, leading to thirst and a desire to drink.

<p>In years when the water element is excessively strong and cold air prevails, it harms the heart fire, causing the people to suffer from thirst and to err in their judgments. [Note: The spleen&#39;s inability to transport its fluids leads to thirst.]</p>
<p><strong>The Suwen (Plain Questions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Five Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we diagnose a person who is prone to consumption? Shao Yu replied: Those whose five organs are soft and weak are prone to consumption. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know the softness and weakness of the five organs? Shao Yu replied: If someone is soft and weak, there must be strength somewhere. Strength often leads to anger, while softness is easily harmed. The Yellow Emperor asked: How do we differentiate between softness and strength? Shao Yu replied: This person&#39;s skin is thin, yet their eyes are deep and firm; they show an upright and assertive demeanor, indicating a strong heart. When strong, one is often angry, and anger causes the qi to reverse and accumulate in the chest, leading to turbulent blood flow. The hip skin becomes filled with muscle, and the blood vessels become stagnant, turning into heat, which then harms the skin, resulting in consumption. [Note: According to this text, there are two types of consumption: one regarding the five organs and the other regarding the muscles. Consumption of the five organs happens within, leading to thirst, while muscle consumption occurs externally, leading to emaciation. When essence and blood are deficient, it causes reverse qi to ascend, hence it is said that the soft and weak must have strength; it refers to the essence of the five organs being soft, while the qi is strong. Thus, the softer one becomes weaker, and the stronger one becomes stronger, leading to disharmony between strength and softness.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes on the text:</strong></p>
<p>The lungs govern the essence and the generation of water.</p>
<p>The liver pulse is very small, which relates to excessive drinking; a slight decrease relates to consumption of essence. When small, both blood and energy are deficient, leading to excessive Wood and Fire.</p>
<p>The spleen pulse is small, indicating a deficiency that prevents the stomach from transporting its fluids.</p>
<p>The kidney pulse is small, indicating a deficiency of essence and blood.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On the Five Flavors</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Salty flavors expedite blood circulation; consuming a lot of this causes thirst. Why is this? Lesser Yu replied: Salty flavors enter the stomach, and their energy rises through the Middle Jiao, flowing into the pulses, thus causing blood and energy to move. When blood mixes with salty flavors, it coagulates; coagulation leads to the juices in the stomach being depleted, and when depleted, the throat becomes dry, resulting in a dry tongue that craves water. The blood vessels belong to the pathway of the Middle Jiao, therefore salty flavors enter and expedite blood circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: When salty flavors enter the stomach, their energy rises through the Middle Jiao and flows into the pulses, which is the nature of salinity rising. This affects blood and energy. Blood is the essence of the Middle Jiao, nourishing the spirit and transforming into red; since salty is associated with the taste of cold water, when blood and salt combine, it coagulates. This leads to dryness and blockage, depleting the juices in the stomach. When the juices are exhausted, the throat becomes dry, hence the tongue becomes dry and craves water.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>The section on diabetes states: The illness of Jueyin manifests as diabetes, where qi rises to the heart, causing pain and heat within the heart, hunger without the desire to eat, and upon eating, one vomits worms; the condition does not cease with purging. The pulse at the inch position is floating and slow; floating indicates deficiency and slow indicates labor; deficiency suggests inadequate defensive qi, while labor implies exhausted qi. The Fuyang pulse is floating and rapid; floating denotes qi, and rapid suggests the consumption of grains leading to rigidity. When the qi is excessive, urination is frequent; frequent urination with hardness indicates diabetes. </p>
<p>For men with diabetes, if urination is excessive—drinking one dou leads to urinating one dou—Kidney Qi Pills are indicated. If the pulse is floating and urination is difficult, with slight heat and diabetes, it is advisable to promote urination and induce sweating, using the Wuling Powder.

<p>The Treatise on Water Qi states that in a case of taiyang disease with a floating and tight pulse accompanied by chills, this results from extreme deficiency leading to sweating. When thirsty without chills, it indicates skin edema; in such cases, thirst with diarrhea and frequent urination indicates that sweating should be avoided. </p>
<p>For interior water retention, the body will show yellow swelling in the face and eyes, with a deep pulse and difficulty in urination, indicating the presence of fluid.

<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions [Tang - Sun Simiao]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>For those who have long indulged in alcohol, there has never been an instance without developing thirst. Although great cold may freeze the sea, it does not freeze the alcohol; this demonstrates the inherently hot nature of alcohol, with nothing to add to it. Salty dried meats and roasted foods are flavors that drinkers crave, never leaving their lips. After three cups, self-control is lost. When drinking and eating with abandon, chewing sauces without discerning their acidity or saltiness, along with countless nights of indulgence, the three burners become intensely heated, and the five organs dry out. Even wood and stone may scorch; how can a person avoid thirst? Whether treated or not depends on the patient. If one can be diligent and cautious, healing may occur in a few months. However, if one does not take care, death will come swiftly. Medical texts contain many effective prescriptions; but what of those who do not exercise caution? The precautions are threefold: first, to avoid drinking; second, to be restrained in sexual activity; and third, to avoid salty foods and flour. Those who can heed these precautions may not need medicine to find relief. Those unaware of this, even with elixirs, cannot be saved. Reflect deeply and exercise caution! Also, for those suffering from thirst, whether healed or not, one must always consider the possibility of significant abscesses. Why? Because in individuals with thirst, abscesses often develop between the major joints, leading to sudden acute complications; thus, one should prepare abscess remedies in advance to prevent them.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A person suffering from thirst due to illness began in spring. After taking medicine throughout the summer, they regained strength and the thirst gradually improved. However, urination remained frequent, exceeding twenty times a day and night, with each time amounting to three or four liters, and at its worst still not reducing below two liters. Over time, the frequency diminished, but the person gradually consumed rich and fatty foods, becoming increasingly emaciated. Their throat felt constricted, lips and mouth dried out, and they experienced shortness of breath, unable to speak much. They felt heat and irritation in the heart, with aching legs, and their appetite multiplied, hence the lack of energy. One should know that this illness arises from excessive heat in a deficient state. </p>
<p>Treatment: Long-term consumption of herbal juice can eliminate heat, while cow&#39;s milk and apricot cheese are good for replenishing, making this method most beneficial. Internal consumption-related illness is caused by heat. Urination exceeding drinking causes extreme depletion and shortness of breath. Internal consumption refers to the transformation of food into urine without triggering thirst. </p>
<p>In observing over ten years, the Governor of Zizhou, Li Wenbo, had long taken white stone as medicine. Suddenly, he experienced a strong desire for intercourse, and after a month, he gradually developed thirst. After several days, urination became excessive, reaching a hundred times a day.

Everything consumed seems to turn into urine, all of which results from excess in sexual conduct. For ordinary people, excessive thirst in summer is attributed to the heart&#39;s governance.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In winter months, when there is no sweat, people tend to urinate more often. This is a sign of someone in good health, referred to as thirst for fluids. However, if one urinates frequently without drinking water, it indicates strong kidney function. The texts say: strong kidneys lead to urination. Thirst without the desire to drink water occurs in such cases. Therefore, those consuming stones will find urination frequent, as the nature of stones returns to the kidneys. When the kidneys are supported by stones, they can effectively metabolize fluids, hence the frequent urination; but when urination is excessive, the five organs do not receive adequate nourishment, leading to their decline and various illnesses. Zhang Zhongjing states: heat congestion in the middle jiao results in hardness, while heat congestion in the lower jiao leads to bloody urination. Moreover, heat congestion can cause dysuria and blockage, which should not excessively irritate frequent urination. If there is internal heat, the person will be thirsty; removing the heat will stop the thirst. Concurrent deficiency needs heat removal and replenishment to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>For anyone suffering from thirst for fluids for over a hundred days, cauterization or needling should not be done. Such treatments may cause pus from sores to not cease, leading to abscesses and eventually emaciation and death. Care must also be taken to avoid accidental harm, even small needle wounds. Any water consumed will turn into pus and exit through the sores. If urination does not cease, death is certain; thus, one must be cautious! At the initial stage of illness, treatments may be applied as prescribed, which is beneficial.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Symptoms of Thirst from Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>When asked about thirst: If the pulse is floating and there is thirst, it pertains to the Taiyang; if there is sweating and thirst, it pertains to the Yangming; if there is wind-cold and fever, or fever with aversion to wind and thirst, it pertains to the Shaoyang; if there is diarrhea and thirst, it pertains to the Shaoyin. </p>
<p>One must strictly avoid giving Baihu Decoction to those with Taiyang syndrome who have no sweat and are thirsty; for Yangming syndrome with much sweating and thirst, one should not give Wuling Powder. One asks: Then for Taiyang disease with thirst, can it ever be treated with Baihu? The reply: For Taiyang syndrome, after sweating, if the pulse is surging and there is thirst, then it can be given. One asks: For Yangming disease with thirst, can it ever be treated with Wuling? The reply: For Yangming syndrome with difficulty in urination, little sweating, floating pulse, and thirst, then it can be given. These are all subtle methods of Zhongjing.</p>
<p>In general, thirst must not be treated with water unless it is a severe thirst. If it is slight thirst with a dry throat, one should sip to moisten it, ensuring the stomach is balanced. If there is severe thirst with great agitation, and a person can drink a dou, then give them five sheng. If nothing is administered, the dryness will prevent sweating, leading to coughing and even death. Common people, seeing that drinking water alleviates slight thirst, often drink excessively, resulting in fullness and cough leading to death; this is very common. One should use Wuling Powder or Xianxiong Pill to treat this.</p>
<p>If the Yang poison is greatly intense, causing extreme thirst, then Heinu Pill is the main treatment. For those who suffer from heatstroke, who are persistently thirsty, use Jiu Zheng Huanglian Pill as the main treatment.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Xiaoke (Diabetes)</strong></p>
<p>The disease of Xiaoke arises from the Sanjiao (Three Jiao), manifesting as upper Xiaoke, middle Xiaoke, and kidney Xiaoke. Upper Xiaoke indicates disease in the upper Jiao, also known as diaphragm disease; it involves excessive thirst, significant water intake, and diminished food consumption, with normal bowel movements and possibly clear, copious urination, indicating dryness in the upper Jiao. Treatment should focus on moistening and relieving dryness.</p>
<p>Middle Xiaoke pertains to the stomach, characterized by thirst with excessive food and drink intake, and yellow urine. The classics state: &#39;Heat consumes the grains,&#39; indicating heat in the middle, thus it is necessary to purge. When one feels disinterested in food and drink, recovery occurs. </p>
<p>Kidney Xiaoke originates in the lower Jiao, initially presenting as a condition known as “gao lin” (mucous urination), where the output resembles oil. As the disease progresses, it leads to a dark complexion, emaciation, and oily, turbid urine. The treatment should focus on nourishing the blood to clarify, separating the clear from the turbid for self-healing.</p>
<p>The method states: dryness above leads to thirst; pungent and sweet flavors promote lung moistening, therefore, honey-boiled ginger soup can be administered generously, to sip occasionally. The method emphasizes: in heart and lung diseases, do not despise frequent small amounts of drink. The Inner Canon says: &#39;For supplementing the upper Jiao, treatment should be gentle.&#39; It also notes: &#39;Use pungent substances to moisten.&#39; Opening the pores facilitates the circulation of fluids, allowing lung qi to descend, hence reducing heat and dryness, ultimately quenching thirst.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noted: &#39;The two Yangs are bound and create the condition of Xiaoke.&#39; Wang’s commentary states: &#39;The two Yangs bind due to heat in the stomach and large intestine.&#39; When the intestines and stomach harbor heat, they can effectively process water and grains. Therefore, a sweet and pungent formula to remove heat may be used: one pound of Huanglian powder, one pound each of fresh Rehmannia glutinosa juice, fresh white lotus root juice, and cow’s milk, simmered into a paste; the Huanglian powder can be formed into pills the size of a wutong seed.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of gastric congestion with heat and fullness, where one feels hungry but does not want to eat, or if the heat has turned into consumption leading to good appetite but weight loss, or due to severe dryness and heat causing thirst, with frequent urination, the excessive heat from the heart and dryness of the three burners impair the smooth flow of fluids, resulting in the body being deprived of moisture, leading to emaciation and a dry, heat-laden thirst. Even with much drinking, the fluids fail to penetrate the stomach and intestines, which cannot satisfy thirst, causing excessive urination. The common misunderstanding that this results from a deficiency and cold in the lower burner has misled many.</p>
<p>If cold from the heart affects the lungs, it leads to lung depletion, with reduced drinking and increased urination. One should nourish the lungs and calm the heart; if dead, it can still be treated, indicating that the heart and lungs are in conflict. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of the Three Dissolutions</strong></p>
<p>The Book of Changes states that from the vast void to the Yellow Springs, there are six positions in heaven and earth. The Inner Canon mentions that the human body has six positions from head to feet. Now I say there are also six positions in the chest and abdomen of a person, from the lungs to the kidneys. Humans are connected with heaven and earth, and the five elements, forged in the same crucible; knowing one leads to understanding the other. Therefore, the celestial energies are categorized as metal and fire, while the terrestrial energies are categorized as earth and water. The vital energies of humans are defined as wind and fire. Thus, when metal and fire combine, they create heat and clarity; when water and earth combine, they create humidity and coldness; when wind and fire combine, they create warmth and intensity. This is also true within the human chest and abdomen. </p>
<p>The lungs, being the highest, represent metal and govern dryness and clarity; the heart, next, represents fire and governs heat; the liver follows, representing wind and wood, which govern warmth; the gallbladder follows as well, representing fire and governing extreme heat; the spleen, following this, represents earth and humidity, governing coolness; and the kidneys, lastly positioned, correspond to the Yellow Springs and govern cold water. Therefore, the heart and lungs symbolize heaven, the spleen and kidneys symbolize earth, while the liver and gallbladder symbolize humanity. Those who do not understand this cannot be engaged in discussions about human ailments. </p>
<p>Earth is the foundation of all things, and water is the essence of all things. When water and earth combine in virtue, they dwell in the yin, residing below as the essence of the earth; all things take root in the earth, hence water and earth produce humidity and cold. If the yang becomes excessively dry and hot, then the energy of the earth fails to establish itself, and the roots of all things wither, leaving branches and leaves dry. The Great Treatise of the Five Constants states: “Those rooted in the center are referred to as the divine mechanism.”<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of animals fundamentally lies in the center. The core comprises the spleen, stomach, and kidneys. When food enters the stomach, the spleen transforms it into qi and flavor, nourishing the five organ systems and all joints. Therefore, sour nourishes the liver to strengthen tendons, bitter nourishes the heart to enhance blood vessels, sweet nourishes the spleen for muscles, spicy nourishes the lungs for skin and hair, and salty nourishes the kidneys for bone marrow. The five qi operate similarly: clear qi nourishes the lungs, hot qi nourishes the heart, warm qi nourishes the liver, damp qi nourishes the spleen, and cold qi nourishes the kidneys. When any of these five flavors or five qi are excessive, illness occurs; if deficient, illness also arises; only in balance can there be stability. Thus, the theory of the six stages and organs states: the five flavors are ingested and stored in the intestines and stomach. Each flavor is stored to nurture the qi of the five organs; when qi is harmonious, it generates life, and bodily fluids are formed, allowing the spirit to arise. This is its principle. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the discussion of the Taiyin and Yangming states: why do the limbs become ineffective when the spleen is ill? Qibo replied: The limbs draw their qi from the stomach, yet cannot reach the channels. This is necessarily because they rely on the spleen and kidneys. Now, if the spleen is ill and unable to move the fluids from the stomach, it cannot derive qi from food and water. The spleen weakens daily, the channels are obstructed, and the muscles, bones, and tissues lack the qi for vitality, hence they become ineffective. The Emperor asked: Why does the spleen not govern the seasons? Qibo replied: The spleen corresponds to the earth, governing the center, and regularly interacts with the four seasons to nourish the five organs, each for eighteen days; it cannot exclusively govern at any one season. The spleen constantly relies on the essence of the stomach’s earth.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The earth is the source of all things and follows the principles of heaven and earth; therefore, from top to bottom, one cannot solely dominate time. The Emperor asked: &quot;The spleen and stomach are interconnected by membranes, yet how can they function to move their fluids?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The foot Taiyin, associated with the three Yin channels, has pulses that connect the stomach to the spleen and throat, thus the Taiyin facilitates the movement of Qi in the three Yin. The foot Yangming, as the exterior and the sea of the five organs and six bowels, also assists in the flow of Qi in the three Yang. The internal organs each draw in Qi through their channels to benefit Yangming, hence the stomach governs the flow of its fluids. The limbs do not draw from food and water, and as the Qi declines daily, the Yin pathways become obstructed, and the sinews, bones, and muscles lack Qi to grow, leading to their inactivity. Inactivity refers to being unable to perform their functions. From this, we see that the five organs and six bowels, as well as the limbs and bones, all rely on the spleen and stomach to circulate their fluids and mutually moisten and nourish each other. Later physicians, wishing to use drying and heating agents to nourish the spleen and stomach and invigorate the earth’s Qi, are misguided, aren&#39;t they? Moreover, for those suffering from thirst and hunger, their inherent damp and cold Yin Qi is already weak; adding excessive drying heat with medicinal herbs further depletes the Qi of the spleen and stomach. Some do not distinguish between the five organs’ and six bowels’ Qi in terms of deficiency and excess, and broadly classify heat as excess and cold as deficiency. They only recognize the heart&#39;s fire as Yang and its Qi as deficient or excessive, missing the nuances of the internal organs&#39; six Qi.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs are fundamentally clear and when deficient, they become warm; the heart is fundamentally hot and when deficient, it becomes cold; the liver is fundamentally warm and when deficient, it becomes clear; the spleen is fundamentally damp and when deficient, it becomes dry; the kidneys are fundamentally cold and when deficient, they become hot. If the stomach is cold and deficient, it indicates a significant presence of cold yin fluids in the stomach and a frail yang fire, not that the earth element of the stomach is fundamentally weak. Therefore, one should warm and tonify the yang fire in the stomach to reduce the excessive cold yin fluids. Similarly, if the stomach is hot and in excess, it indicates a strong yang fire in the stomach and a deficiency of yin fluids, thus cold herbs should be used to drain the excess fire in the stomach while nourishing the deficient fluids. These methods address the excess and deficiency of yin and yang within the stomach, rather than the fundamental dampness of the stomach. The same applies to other organs. To address the dampness of the spleen and stomach, to moisten the dampness is to tonify it, and to dry the dampness is to drain it, as the earth element is inherently damp. </p>
<p>In all organs and systems, it is not necessary for the kidney water to solely manage cold or for the heart fire to solely manage heat; one must understand that each organ harmonizes its respective energies. I often say that the principle of the five elements is that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin; solitary yin does not thrive, and solitary yang cannot prevail. All things contain their counterparts, and the five elements support one another, which is called harmony; their interactions of overcoming and weakening represent decline and growth; chaos and disarray lead to afflictions. Therefore, when water is scarce and fire abundant, it signifies a strong yang and a weak yin, leading to heat diseases; conversely, when water is abundant and fire scarce, it signifies a strong yin and a weak yang, leading to cold diseases. Thus, the treatment involves draining excesses and tonifying deficiencies, aiming for balance.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, to treat diabetes, one should replenish the kidney&#39;s water and the deficiency of yin and cold, while draining the heart&#39;s fire and excess heat, eliminating excessive dryness and heat from the intestines and stomach. This helps to restore the body&#39;s fluids, preventing blockage in the pathways, allowing the fluids to flourish instead of drying up, ensuring the qi and blood are flowing without stagnation; thus, the illness will gradually disappear. Moreover, those with diabetes initially incur such conditions due to improper diet and medication, causing dryness and stagnation in the intestines and stomach, hindering the smooth distribution of qi and fluids, which may lead to mental disturbance, excessive imbalance, or result from major illnesses that diminish yin energy, weakening the blood and leading to excessive yang heat and dryness. </p>
<p>Hence, the three types of diabetes arise from a long-standing craving for salty foods, excessive intake of fried and roasted items, and heavy drinking. Some young people also consume pills made from metals and stones, which can accumulate and create internal heat, leading to a deficiency in the lower body. The blood and qi cannot regulate this heat; hence, the stomach becomes excessively dry, resulting in thirst and urging to drink. </p>
<p>If one drinks a lot and urinates frequently, it is called &quot;water diabetes&quot; (Xiao Ke); if one eats a lot but remains constantly hungry, with frequent urination and gradual weight loss, it is termed &quot;middle diabetes&quot; (Xiao Zhong); if one is thirsty and drinks continuously, with thin legs and oily urine, it is referred to as &quot;kidney diabetes&quot; (Shen Xiao). These three types are essentially caused by dryness and heat, with variations in severity. </p>
<p>I have heard that many people universally treat these three types of diabetes with the same approach because they are good at persisting through food but are troubled by thirst. However, discussions about diabetes often overlook the fundamental causes.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discourse states that in cases of thirst, the upper part is truly hot while the lower part is cold and vacuous. The upper heat leads to excessive thirst and drinking, while the lower cold results in frequent urination. This is fundamentally due to the deficiency of the kidney water in the lower region, which cannot control the heart fire in the upper region; hence, the upper is truly hot while the lower is vacuous and cold. </p>
<p>It is also said that water is the foundation of all things and precedes the five elements, hence kidney water is the source of human vitality and should not be allowed to weaken. If the root is not firm, the branches and leaves will not flourish; if the vital essence is not solid, the body will not thrive. </p>
<p>In cases of thirst, the lower kidney water is extremely cold. If cold drugs are taken further, the vital essence will turnEmpty, and the kidney water will weaken, leading to an exacerbation of the upper heart fire, making it difficult to treat. The correct approach is to use warming medicines to nourish the vital essence. If the lower kidney water becomes strong enough to subdue the upper heart fire, then naturally thirst will cease, urination will return to normal, and the condition will improve. </p>
<p>Such statements contradict those of Zhong Jing and are what is referred to as clever words that seem plausible but violate the actual principles. This is not merely a misunderstanding of today; it has been a long-standing error. </p>
<p>Additionally, in Jiang&#39;s &quot;Pharmaceutical Evidence&quot; discussing the pathology of thirst and kidney diseases, it is stated: &quot;The three burners and five organs are all suffer from hyperactivity, yet only the bladder is cold like ice.&quot; It further states: &quot;The lower back kidney is increasingly cold.&quot; It reiterates that the bladder and kidney are as cold as a spring. Initially, it describes the three burners and five organs as all having a hyperactive state, yet the bladder alone is cold like ice. Then it states that the five organs are also cold and the kidney water is cold, suggesting a state of emptiness, while the remaining heat is described as similarly vacuous.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The rise and fall of yin and yang, how can this be reasoned? Moreover, their statements do not correspond, and their errors are minor; but regarding the differences between cold and heat, using opposing treatments is the greatest mistake of all. Some say that the kidneys and bladder belong to water; when they are deficient, they cannot control fire. If they cannot control fire, then those with frequent urination are far from recovery. They assert that when the water essence is abundant, it can control fire, but if it is deficient, it cannot control fire. Hence, when yang is abundant and yin is deficient, it causes dryness and heats the liquids, resulting in scanty urination; while when yin is abundant and yang is deficient, it cannot control water, leading to frequent urination. Yet, those who are thirsty and have frequent urination do not realize this. Why is that? It is because excessive dryness and heat cause the Sān Jiāo (Triple Burner) and the intestines and stomach to become affected, leading to blockages that prevent water and liquid from seeping out and nourishing the hundred bones. Therefore, outside the intestines and stomach, the excessive dryness and heat, even with much intake, ultimately cannot moisten the exterior, resulting in unceasing thirst. Those with frequent urination, due to excessive intake, cannot disperse liquid outside of the intestines and stomach, hence they urinate frequently. Thus, in the classic &quot;Yuán Bìng Shì,&quot; it states: the sweat pores of the skin refer to the openings that release sweat; the gas gates refer to the portals that release qi; the channels refer to the paths and patterns of qi and liquid; the ghost gates refer to the entrance to the netherworld; the original hall refers to the abode of the essence.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The human body&#39;s organs, skin, muscles, fascia, bone marrow, nails, and teeth, as well as all things, are interconnected through pathways of entry and exit, ascending and descending. Thus, it is stated in the classics: if entry and exit are hindered, the spirit’s mechanisms will perish; if ascending and descending cease, the energy will stand isolated and perilous. Therefore, without entry and exit, there can be no growth, maturation, aging; without ascending and descending, there can be no transformation and storage. It is understood that entry and exit, ascending and descending, exist in all things. Hence, the human faculties of sight, hearing, smell, taste, body, mind, and consciousness, which can be utilized, function due to the unobstructed flow of these movements; if blocked, they cannot function. If the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear, the nose cannot detect fragrance, the tongue cannot taste, the muscles weaken, bones ache, nails recede, teeth decay, hair falls out, skin loses sensation, and the intestines and stomach cannot excrete fluids, all result from a stagnation of heat, an obstruction of the vital center, preventing fluids and blood pathways from ascending, descending, and flowing. Each condition varies in severity, producing different ailments. If the ailment is superficial, it results in stagnation; the pores become tightly closed, preventing the yang energy from dispersing, leading to dryness without sweat and inability for Qi and fluids to emerge. The unlearned do not recognize this, thus observing frequent thirst and urination, mistakenly attributing it to cold in the lower parts. Little do they realize that heat and stagnation in the intestines and stomach cause this. I present this to illustrate that thirst is essentially due to stagnation and blockage of the pathways of excretion in the intestines and stomach: although water enters the intestines and stomach, it cannot be released outward, resulting in frequent urination and subsequent thirst. This explanation suffices to elucidate the matter. One can refer to the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; for all discussions about thirst and clarify the principle thoroughly.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are those who say that thirst arises from heart and lung Qi stagnation, some who say it comes from liver blockage, some who say it is due to spleen heat, and others who attribute it to kidney heat. Some mention thirst arising from heat accumulation in the stomach and large intestine, while others speak of thirst from intestinal blockage. There are also cases of thirst due to small intestine heat, thirst caused by disease-induced fevers, and thirst arising from indulgence in rich food and drink. Additionally, there are those who experience thirst after excessive drinking or from fatigue caused by long journeys in the heat, as well as thirst from damage to the stomach and thirst from kidney heat or from illness-induced wind. Despite the different parts of the five organs and the various ailments encountered, they all ultimately return to the commonality of dryness and heat.</p>
<p>Regarding thirst from heart and lung Qi stagnation, it is said that heat from the heart moves to the lungs, leading to diaphragm heat. The note explains that prolonged heat transfer from the heart to the lungs results in diaphragmatic heat and excessive thirst with much drinking. Concerning liver blockage and thirst, it is noted that patients with liver blockage are easily startled while sleeping, have excessive thirst, and urinate frequently. As for thirst due to spleen heat, it is stated that when the spleen&#39;s Qi is hot, the stomach dries out and thirst arises, leading to muscle weakness and potential muscle wasting. Regarding thirst from kidney heat, it is noted that kidney heat conditions first exhibit pain and soreness in the lower back, followed by severe thirst and frequent drinking, along with overall body heat. The discussion also mentions that the Shaoyin meridian connects to the kidneys, branches to the lungs, and is linked to the root of the tongue, thus causing dry mouth, dry tongue, and thirst.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Uncle Shi stated that kidney deficiency cannot control heart fire, leading to excess heat above and deficiency and coldness below. Using warm herbs to tonify kidney water in order to overcome heart fire reveals an unclear understanding of the principles of yin and yang and deficiency and excess. Kidney water belongs to yin and is inherently cold; when deficient, it becomes heat. Heart fire belongs to yang and is inherently hot; when deficient, it becomes cold. If kidney water is deficient and yin is weak, this results in real yang heat of heart fire, which is described as yang being strong while yin is weak, thus both upper and lower regions are full of heat. Therefore, the Treatise on Stagnation of Qi states: when kidney qi is weak, yang qi prevails. The Manifestation of the Five Qi Theory states: the kidney despises dryness, for from dryness, the kidney becomes depleted and the water dries up. The Discussion on Organ Qi states: the kidney suffers from dryness, and one should urgently consume warm and moistening foods. Cold substances belong to yin and can nourish water while draining heart fire; hot substances belong to yang and can nourish fire while depleting water. If kidney water is already unable to contend with heart fire, leading to heat both above and below, how can one use warm herbs to nourish kidney water in the hope of overcoming heart fire? Is this not misguided? Similarly, when the stomach and large intestine are hotly bound and produce thirst, the discussion of yin and yang states: when both yangs bind, it leads to exhaustion. The note clarifies: both yangs binding indicates heat binding in both the stomach and large intestine. Heat in the intestines and stomach can effectively digest food and water. Additionally, the Treatise on Stagnation of Qi states: the large intestine transfers heat to the stomach, making one able to eat yet become thin. The Essentials of Pulsology states: when the pulse entails coalescing into exhaustion, one can eat yet remain thin. If thirst arises from intestinal obstruction, frequent drinking does not lead to fulfillment, causing shortness of breath and restlessness, with intermittent diarrhea. If one frequently drinks without satisfaction, their bowel movements must inevitably be unstable.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one suffers from excessive thirst, drinks frequently, and has abundant urination, it is evidently due to dryness and heat accumulating in the Sanjiao (Three Burners) and a decline of Qi. How can one use drying and heating poisons to enhance Yang and combat the deficiency of Yin? This is truly a mistake of confusing the real with the false. Thirst often leads to conditions like deafness, blindness, sores, abscesses, and acne, all stemming from dryness and heat in the intestines and stomach, preventing fluid from moisturizing the body. If the heat is severe and results in the bladder being obstructed, it cannot excrete fluids properly, causing water to leak and swelling in the face.</p>
<p>For those who experience thirst due to damp-heat in the small intestine, it is remarked that when heat and Qi are retained there, pain in the intestines arises, and the heat causes thirst, leading to difficulty in urination. It is noted that heat dries up liquids, hence making the urine hard. In the case of thirst due to malaria, it is said: &quot;When Yang is strong, there is external heat; when Yin is deficient, there is internal heat. If both internal and external heat exist, there will be panting and thirst, leading to the desire for cold drinks.&quot; Thus, with strong Yang and deficient Yin resulting in pathogenic heat, one should use cooling medicines to nourish Yin and drain Yang. This is called the way of draining the excess and supplementing the deficiency.</p>
<p>If thirst arises from rich and sweet foods, it is a peculiar illness. The question arises: What is the name of the illness caused by a sweet mouth? Qi Bo says: &quot;This is due to an overflow of the five Qi. The name of the illness is Spleen Dampness.&quot; Dampness is heat; if the spleen is hot, it cannot nourish the four organs, causing Qi to overflow. This condition arises because of spleen heat, thus it is called Spleen Dampness. The classics say: &quot;When the five flavors enter and are stored in the stomach, the spleen circulates their essence and Qi. The fluids in the spleen make the mouth sweet; this is produced by richness and beauty, hence one must frequently consume sweet and rich foods.&quot;<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The obese generate internal heat, while sweet foods lead to fullness; hence their vital energy overflows upwards, resulting in thirst. The comprehensive discussion on deficiency and excess states: wasting and weakness, fullness causing nausea, obesity contributes to diseases related to rich foods. Some say the stomach&#39;s vitality is fundamental, while the spleen and stomach together form the internal and external; the spleen and stomach, representing the central region, should receive warmth and nourishment to adjust diet. Nowadays, those suffering from thirst have extreme deficiency in the spleen and stomach, hence should be warmed and nourished. If cold medicines are taken, they will deplete the spleen and stomach, making the original vital energy deficient and difficult to treat. This reflects a misunderstanding of the principles of yin and yang, cold and heat, deficiency and excess, leading to reckless statements without fear. Do they not know that the treatise on the abdomen states: The emperor said: The master frequently speaks of &#39;heat in the middle&#39; and &#39;thirst in the middle&#39;, one should not take fragrant herbs or stone medicines. Stone medicines cause mania, and fragrant herbs provoke madness. The annotations explain: Excessive drinking and urination is termed &#39;heat in the middle&#39;; excessive eating and urination is &#39;thirst in the middle&#39;. Rejoicing excessively leads to mania, while excessive anger leads to madness. Fragrant tastes good, while stone refers to the milk of jade, which is heat-inducing medicine. The scripture also states: &#39;Heat in the middle&#39; and &#39;thirst in the middle&#39; refers to the wealthy. Now to forbid rich foods disregards their desires, and forbidding fragrant herbs and stone medicines prevents healing—one wishes to understand this reasoning. Qi Bo said: Fragrant herbs have a delightful taste, stone medicines have a harsh taste; both possess urgent and forceful energies, thus only those with a calm heart can consume these two. The emperor asked: Why is that? Qi Bo answered: The heat energy is strong and fierce, and the energies of these medicines are likewise. So-called &#39;drink once, urinate twice&#39; refers to the lung energy expelling water; when the sea of water and grain is exhausted, it leads to thirst. Generally, when one sees thirst, hastily prescribing heat medicines has misled many.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the Inner Canon states that thirst manifests in this way, is it not clear? Yet, there are still those who are confused; they believe that excessive qi can lead to a reversal in triumph, which is why many people err. This is similar to yang reaching its peak and resembling yin. If one does not clearly distinguish the root from its manifestations, misunderstanding will ensue. Thus, whenever one feels coolness in the lower body and knees feel like ice, this indicates that heart fire is not descending, appearing like cold water. Cold herbs should be administered to purge it; after three to five doses, the fire will decrease and water will rise, and the cold will naturally recede. However, the world collectively clings to delusion, treating the Classic of Spirituality and the Classic of Suwen as discarded remnants, which is truly lamentable! Therefore, when addressing these conditions, one must clearly understand the root and manifestations of the disease, grasp the capabilities of the medicine, and know where to regulate the qi without causing harm, and thus one can formulate a prescription. The so-called root and manifestations refer to the primary disease as the root and its secondary manifestations as the sign; this relates to the transmission of disease&#39;s essentials. One should first assist in urgent situations. It is also said that the six qi are the root and the three yin and three yang are the manifestations; this particularly pertains to the urgent cases of organ diseases. It is further noted that the six qi refer to the stomach&#39;s root; if the stomach is hot, then the stomach is the manifestation and heat is the root. When addressing the prescription, one must eliminate the heat within the stomach, which treats the root. Thus, among the six qi, the severe ones are considered the evil, and the weaker ones as the correct; therefore, the practice should be to drain the excessive and tonify the deficient, with balance as the goal. Nourishing the righteous and eliminating the evil is the way of heaven. Generally, in treating diseases, knowing the root and manifestations and applying the appropriate methods, why must one scheme with the masses? In the discourse on yin and yang, it is said: be cautious and thoroughly understand yin and yang, and do not conspire with the many.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Treatise on Symptoms and Pathogens states: To know the symptoms and the root cause is to ensure accuracy in every action; to be unaware of the symptoms and the root is to act recklessly. The Great Discussion on Essential Truths states: To know the symptoms and the root causes, applying this knowledge, is without danger. To clearly understand opposites and comply properly leads to no errors. Those who are unaware of this cannot effectively discuss diagnosis and are merely capable of confusing the principles. Hence, it is said: Rough practitioners, jovial and overconfident, think they know, proclaim the heat has not yet receded, and the cold illness re-emerges; similar symptoms in different manifestations mislead diagnosis and confuse the principles—this is what is meant. The principle of symptoms and root causes is fundamental yet extensive; though small, it encompasses the great and allows one to understand many from just one. Discussing symptoms and root is simple yet undiminished; examining the root and symptoms allows for the adjustment of the vital energy. Clearly understanding reversals serves everyone, fulfilling the Way of Heaven. The Great Discussion on the Origins of Heaven states: When the numbers reach their extremes and the principles are without confusion, it is indeed clarity. The so-called skillful use of medicine differentiates warmth and coolness, opposing cold and heat, dryness and wetness, which has been previously mentioned—this pertains to vital energy.

Dryness, governed by metal, disperses while wood counters it; earth and dampness are characterized by ease, with water overcoming it, thus it can be so. Bitter can dry and solidify, and fire is associated with bitterness. The Book of Changes states: Nothing excels fire in nourishing all things. Generally, things that are dry are solid. Sweet can ease urgency and disperse blockages; sweet pertains to earth. Dryness can create sudden blockages; therefore, easing leads to urgency in dispersing blockages. Pungent can disperse and suppress blockages while moistening dryness; pungent pertains to metal.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When gold is scattered, it generates water. Moreover, when it comes to binding and scattering, the essence and fluids circulate, leading to the generation of moisture. The theory of organ dynamics states that the kidneys suffer from dryness, hence one should urgently consume pungent foods to moisten them. Opening the pores ensures the flow of fluids and qi. Salty substances can soften hardness; salt represents water, which is moist and soft, thus overcoming the hardness of fire. This relates to the flavors associated with the five organs. The essence of these five flavors is blandness. Blandness is the flavor of the stomach, which is associated with earth. Earth is the foundation of all things, and the stomach is the foundation of the body. The &quot;Tian Yuan Ji Da Lun&quot; states that in the earth, transformation occurs, producing the five flavors; hence the fundamental flavor of the five tastes is bland, to correspond with the stomach&#39;s earth element. Blandness can penetrate and stimulate the channels. Dryness can lead to urgent binding, while sweetness can alleviate it. Blandness represents solid earth, which can greatly moisten dryness, ease urgent binding, allow qi to flow, and thus facilitate the seepage of bodily fluids. Therefore, for those suffering from excessive thirst, both medicine and food should be light. The &quot;Zhen Zhen Yao Da Lun&quot; states: pungent and sweet flavors promote dispersion (yang), sour and bitter flavors promote elimination (yin); salty flavor promotes elimination (yin), while bland flavor promotes seepage (yang). The six flavors can either disperse or consolidate, be slow or fast, dry or moist, hard or soft, which serve to benefit and regulate qi. The &quot;Ben Cao&quot; states: there are three grades of medicine: the superior grade is the sovereign, which primarily nourishes life, with minor toxicity to correspond with heaven; the middle grade is the minister, which primarily nourishes nature, with regular toxicity to correspond with humanity; the inferior grade is the assistant, which primarily treats illness, with major toxicity to correspond with the earth. Things not classified into these three grades are toxic substances.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

The path of treatment is that the one who governs the sick is the ruler, the one who assists the ruler is the minister, and the one who responds to the minister&#39;s needs is the assistant. According to the root of the illness, there are rules of rulers, ministers, assistants, and envoys, as well as their corresponding oddity, size, and positions. This clarifies the seasonal and political conditions concerning the ruler and ministers, as well as the oppositions and alignments, and the main treatment method that should be applied according to the illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ming Theory [Jin, Cheng Wujì]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Syndrome of Thirst in Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>How do we understand the thirst in febrile diseases? Thirst indicates internal heat. When the pathogen of febrile disease transmits from the exterior to the interior, there will inevitably be identifiable symptoms that appear according to the severity of the pathogen. Although it is said that on the first day it is in the skin, on the second day in the flesh, on the third day in the muscles, on the fourth day in the chest, on the fifth day in the abdomen, and on the sixth day entering the stomach, those that transmit through the meridians also manifest with symptoms.</p>
<p>The Taiyang primarily governs Qi and is the first to be affected by the pathogen. On the first or second day, if there is headache and rigidity of the waist and spine, this is indicative. When Taiyang transmits to Yangming, on the second or third day there will be fever, eye pain, and nasal dryness, making it difficult to lie down. When Yangming transmits to Shaoyang, on the third or fourth day there will be pain in the chest and ribs, and deafness in the ears. These three Yang meridians are affected by disease; the pathogen is still on the surface and has not yet caused heat, hence there is no thirst.</p>
<p>By the fourth or fifth day, as Shaoyang transmits to Taiyin, the pathogenic influence gradually enters the interior, and cold evil begins to transform into heat. At this time, the body fluids are depleted, leading to abdominal fullness and throat dryness. By the fifth or sixth day, as Taiyin transmits to Shaoyin, the internal heat becomes progressively deeper. At this time, the body fluids are attacked by the heat, gradually consumed and dried up, resulting in dry mouth, dry tongue, and thirst. By the sixth or seventh day, the Shaoyin pathogen transmits to Jueyin, and the illness in Jueyin is characterized by excessive thirst, indicating that the internal heat has reached its limit. The so-called excessive thirst means that there is an abundance of drinking water but little urination, signifying that the heat can consume the water.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when the disease of typhoid reaches six or seven days and the patient feels thirsty and wants to drink water, this is a sign of the body’s desire to recover, as the transmission of the pathogen has progressed. Thus, it is said in the diagnosis of Jueyin disease: if the patient is thirsty and wants to drink water, a little should be given to help recovery. When the evil qi first enters the body, the heat is still dispersed and has not yet consolidated into real heat; it pervades and harms the stomach, consuming bodily fluids and resulting in thirst. Although the patient is thirsty and wishes to drink, one should not give them too much. If too much water is consumed, the heat cannot be dispelled, leading to further complications. The classic states: whenever one suffers from seasonal illnesses, if thirsty by the fifth or sixth day, do not give them a lot to drink. Why? Because the heat in the abdomen is still slight and cannot be dispelled, doing so might exacerbate the condition. If there is great thirst and a strong desire for water, one should still treat according to the symptoms, but provide only what is insufficient; do not overindulge. It is said that one can drink a dou (10 liters) or five sheng (around 1.5 liters); again, if thirsty and wanting water, a little should be offered, and methods should be used to alleviate the situation. For thirsting patients, Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) is recommended. If the thirst is extreme and they wish to drink several sheng, Baihu Decoction with ginseng is the principal remedy, all aiming to moisten dryness and generate bodily fluids. In general, if a patient is capable of drinking, this indicates a desire for recovery; however, those who do not understand the illness mistakenly believe that drinking will bring healing. For those with a slight thirst, when forcefully given water, it can lead to significant disasters that cannot be remedied. Symptoms such as palpitations, chest fullness, difficulty breathing, coughs, choking, dry retching, abdominal distension, and frequent diarrhea or difficulty urinating are all due to excessive drinking harming the body. Practitioners of diagnosis must be aware of this to avoid errors.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Confucian Duty to Parents</strong><br><em>By Zhang Congzheng in the Yuan Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>Three Consumptions Should Follow the Fire’s Dispersal</strong></p>
<p>Among the Eight Trigrams, only Li can illuminate things; among the Five Elements, only Fire can burn things; among the Six Energies, only Fire can eliminate things. Therefore, the utility of Fire is such that when wood is burned, it is transformed into charcoal; when earth is burned, it is transformed into dragon&#39;s liver; when metal is refined, it is transformed into juice; when stone is calcined, it is transformed into ash; when water is boiled, it is transformed into broth; when the sea is distilled, it is transformed into salt; when mercury is dried, it turns into powder; when tin is smelted, it is transformed into vermilion. Thus, the marsh&#39;s runoff dries under the blazing sun; the water in the cauldron evaporates under strong fire. The Five Organs: the heart represents the sovereign Fire&#39;s proper transformation, and the kidneys represent the sovereign Fire&#39;s opposing transformation; the Triple Burner represents the ministerial Fire’s proper transformation, and the gallbladder represents the ministerial Fire’s opposing transformation. When balance is achieved, food can be prepared and waste removed; when balance is lost, it burns and scorches the organs, leading to depletion of bodily fluids. Hence, anything that enters water flourishes; anything that enters fire perishes. The fire of the heart within the body dominates the upper part, leading to the elimination of layers; it dominates the middle, affecting the intestines and stomach; it dominates the lower part affecting bodily fluids; and it dominates the exterior affecting the muscles.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If excessive heat goes unchecked upwards, it affects the lungs; if it goes unchecked in the middle, it affects the spleen; if it goes unchecked downwards, it affects the liver and kidneys; if it goes unchecked externally, it affects the sinews and bones. When all four organs are completely depleted, the heart will begin to burn and perish. Therefore, the &quot;Suwen&quot; mentions various types of consumption: consuming deficiency, middle consumption, thirst consumption, wind consumption, phlegm consumption, and lung consumption. The symptoms of consumption differ, but they all point to a common underlying fire. Thus, consuming deficiency is a general term for various consumptions; middle consumption refers to the state of being excessively hungry; thirst consumption refers to the state of being excessively thirsty. However, wind consumption, phlegm consumption, and lung consumption should not be confused. Wind consumption is a disease of the two Yangs. The two Yangs refer to the Yangming, which is the stomach and large intestine. If the heart is affected, the blood does not flow, leading to women being unable to have their monthly cycle; if the spleen is affected, flavors do not transform, causing men to have low vitality, both unable to engage in matters of hidden fulfillment. When heat is trapped internally and persists, it stirs up wind that depletes the intestines and stomach, resulting in dry mouth. Even when drinking water, one cannot swallow; this is the rejection of wind-heat at the entrance of the stomach. The mouth is the upper source of disease, hence the illness manifests as such. Moreover, it is stated that the binding of the two Yangs is called consumption, and this consumption refers to the depletion of the intestines and stomach. Those who eat well yet remain thin are referred to as &quot;food deficiency,&quot; and this consumption is the depletion of muscle.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition known as &quot;Ge Xiao&quot; arises when heat from the heart is transferred to the lungs, leading to what is termed &quot;Ge Xiao.&quot; Wang Taifu states: Between the heart and lungs lies the oblique diaphragm, which connects with the horizontal diaphragm below. Therefore, when heat from the heart moves to the lungs and over time transforms, it becomes an internal heat of the diaphragm. In cases of excessive thirst, even when there is significant drinking, this is due to the lung&#39;s metal element being affected by the heart&#39;s fire evil; however, it is still only &quot;Ge Xiao,&quot; not reaching the lungs themselves. Hence, even drinking large amounts of water cannot quench the thirst. The symptoms include excessive drinking and frequent urination, or in some cases, not urinating frequently and developing edema, all of which stem from this condition. This is the &quot;Xiao&quot; related to the diaphragm. &quot;Lung Xiao,&quot; on the other hand, occurs when cold from the heart affects the lungs, which govern air. The classics say: food and drink enter the stomach, overflowing with vital essence, and are then transferred to the spleen; the spleen&#39;s essence returns to the lungs, connecting and regulating the water pathways, which then disperse to the bladder. The essential fluids spread throughout the four directions, with the five channels operating harmoniously to maintain normalcy. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; also mentions: the upper burner is like mist, the middle burner like bubbling, and the lower burner like a drain.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now the heart is like fire, initially affected by Yang pathogens. The Yang fire becomes stagnant internally, spreading the heat within. The lungs, associated with metal, are restrained, and both fire and cold pathogens invade them. Externally, the lungs are weakened by cold, while internally they are dried out by fire. The extreme heat leads to a return of water flow, causing the skin to feel dry and tense, resulting in scorching heat in urination and frequent need to relieve oneself. Thus, it is said that drinking leads to urination and death. If the diaphragm is not assailed by cold, the Yang energy can disperse outward, making treatment possible. However, if the lungs are affected by cold, the Yang energy collapses internally, and treatment is unfeasible. This condition pertains to the consumption affecting the lungs. </p>
<p>If the Spleen Wind transmits to the kidneys, it is called hernia or masses. The lower abdomen becomes resentfully hot and painful, leading to the discharge of white fluid, known as &quot;gu&quot;. Wang Taifu stated: the consumption consumes fat and flesh like worms eroding away, gradually reducing them; this consumption refers to the depletion of the essence. Therefore, later scholars discuss the three burnings referring to kidney consumption, which might still be treatable, or else the person will develop complications, and without intervention, death is inevitable. This consumption directly affects the kidneys. </p>
<p>Consumption inevitably leads to thirst, which has three types: thirst for sweetness, thirst for stones, and thirst from dryness of fire. Those with much fat lead to internal heat; sweet foods lead to fullness, causing the Qi to overflow, converting to excessive thirst. The classics also say: rich tastes generate heat. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; further states: salty flavor moves the blood; consuming it in abundance leads to thirst. When salt enters the stomach, the Qi ascends through the middle jiao, directing to the lungs, where the blood Qi flows with it. The blood interacts with salt, thickening and becoming dry, which induces thirst. The blood vessels are the pathway of the middle jiao. All of this pertains to the thirst from rich and sweet items.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

This is the thirst brought about by stone medicine. Yangming governs the heavens, corresponding with the four energies, leading to dryness in the throat and a craving for drinks. This occurs because the heart fire is restrained by cold water. Shaoyang governs the heavens, corresponding with the three energies; when summer heat arrives, people suffer from thirst. Taiyang governs the heavens, and when it becomes severe, there is excessive thirst and desire to drink, resulting from the flow of water obstructing fire, which causes the fiery energy to be constrained. Upon recovery from Shaoyin, there is thirst and a desire to drink, while recovery from Shaoyang leads to a throat that feels scorched and dry, prompting a craving for drinks, and a change in color to yellowish-red. After suffering from cold for five days, if afflicted by Shaoyin, one experiences dryness of the mouth, a dry tongue, and thirst. Those with kidney heat disease experience severe thirst and frequent drinking. All of these are instances of dryness and heat leading to thirst. Thus, individuals who consume rich foods tend to experience thirst from rich and sweet foods, as well as from stone medicines; those engaged in strenuous activities often experience thirst from dryness and heat. Although these two types differ, they are fundamentally the same. Therefore, when fire is concentrated above, there is strong thirst; when it is in the middle, it enhances digestion and causes hunger; when it is both in the upper and middle sections, there is the tendency for thirst, increased drinking, and frequent urination; when it is primarily in the middle and lower sections, there is no thirst but clear urination; and when it is spread throughout the upper, middle, and lower sections, there is increased drinking and frequent urination. This outlines their distinctions. Later generations attributed excessive thirst to kidney deficiency, which results from water being unable to overcome fire.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Why is this medicine inappropriate? The Eight Flavor Pill treats thirst, yet it does not produce water and instead promotes fire. Such individuals are fundamentally ignorant of the texts, carelessly quoting the annotations of Wang Taifu, increasing the source of fire to extinguish the yin shadow, and bolstering the water element to control the yang light. However, they only enhance the heart&#39;s yang, allowing cold and heat to flow freely, and strengthen the kidney&#39;s yin—heat may work, but do they understand that Wang Taifu&#39;s intention was to balance cold and heat? The kidneys inherently dislike dryness; can fire be added to them? Nowadays, Liu Hejian personally formulates the Shenqiong Pill, incorporating bitter Huangqin to enter the heart, using Qianqiu and Dahuang to drive heat downward, and Shiwei to draw it into the kidney pathway. This formula regards Qianqiu and Shiwei as the monarch, with Dahuang and Huangqin as ministers, and Chuanxiong, Lian, and Bohe as envoys, aiming to separate what is above from what is below—this embodies the secret meaning of the Huang Court. Additionally, by using Ren Shen, Bai Zhu Decoction, Xiaopi Pill, Da Ren Shen Powder, Biyu, and Jisus Powder in various methods to adjust, it thus effectively treats thirst. In the past, there was a person with great thirst who drank several liters daily. A master used a basin of natural ginger juice, placed it in a sealed room with a container, and had the person enter, then locked the door. When the patient felt extreme thirst, they had no choice but to drink the juice entirely, and their thirst diminished. This illustrates the intent of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; in moistening.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; the treatment for thirst involves using orchids to eliminate stagnant qi, which is also a mild remedy. Although the teacher&#39;s formula includes this single ingredient, there must be additional herbs to aid it. Initially, Yu Shi stated: When dealing with thirst-related illnesses that have not yet developed sores, one should use cold laxatives like rhubarb to facilitate the body’s recovery from great fatigue and weakness, similar to how sores may release pus and blood leading to diarrhea; this is indeed a common saying. Hence, the governor of Ba County claimed that Sanhuang Pills could treat thirst. In my own experience, after several years without improvement, I removed (stone salt) and nitrate, then added one pound of Coptis to create a large potion, brewing it vigorously for five to seven boils, allowing it to cool, and drinking it in hundreds of sips over several days. Alternately, I used Gui Ling Gan Lu Powder, Bai Hu Decoction, fresh lotus stem juice, light bamboo juice, and raw Rehmannia juice in a staggered manner, producing a large quantity to replace drinking water, and soon achieved recovery. Therefore, for the symptom of thirst, with balanced treatment without excessive purging, it results in slight moisture. A slight moistening ultimately cannot quell the heat rising; if purging is conducted without balance, it leads to continual drinking and dissipation, never truly nourishing the dryness of the diaphragm. Purging, balancing, and not diminishing flavors, without abstaining from desires or regulating emotions—if the illness recurs after recovery, if one can address these three aspects, thirst will not be a major concern.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Furthermore, the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that a slippery heart pulse indicates good thirst; it also says that a slippery pulse signifies predominant Yang energy. It mentions that when the heart pulse is faint, it signifies consumption, and that fragile heart pulses in the five organs likewise indicate consumption. It describes those with consumption as having thin skin yet firm flesh, tall and upright, with a strong heart. Those who are strong often have anger; when anger arises, Qi reverses upward, accumulating in the chest, and the blood and Qi flow back to the skin, filling the muscles, causing the pulse to stagnate, thus transforming into heat. This heat then consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. It also states that if all five organs are soft and weak, they are predisposed to consumption. Softness and weakness must coexist with strength; strength often leads to anger, and softness easily gets injured. From this, I realized that those with reversed Qi are not only suffering from consumption. If there is cold on the outside, it may lead to boils, shortness of breath, mania, obstruction in the chest, lung consumption, or water retention; if heat invades the organs, it can cause shock, nosebleeds, consumption of the diaphragm, frailty, and abdominal death; if it affects the bowels, it may lead to urinary retention, blood in urine, mouth ulcers, abdominal tension, food issues, throat obstruction, nasal congestion, nosebleeds, or blindness. These twenty-one conditions are all discussed in the theory of Qi counterflow. The text states: All upward counterflows pertain to fire.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Thirst</strong></p>
<p>The distinctions of Yin and Yang state that &quot;the two Yangs converging is called &#39;thirst.&#39;&quot; The Treatise on the Essentials of Pulse states: &quot;dampness becomes thirst.&quot; The two Yangs refer to Yangming. The Hand Yangming (large intestine) governs fluid ailments; when dampness (thirst) occurs, the eyes turn yellow and the mouth becomes dry, indicating insufficient fluids. The Foot Yangming (stomach) governs blood; when heat arises, it causes a thirst for food and a craving for snacks, indicative of blood deficiency due to latent fire. Convergence signifies insufficient bodily fluids that are stagnant and not nourishing, leading to conditions of dryness and heat. This arises from consuming excessively sweet and rich food, causing qi to overflow upward and transform into thirst; such conditions are treated with medicinal herbs like orchid to eliminate stale qi. One must avoid sticky, rich, fragrant food and mineral medicines, as their essence is harsh and can exacerbate dryness and heat.</p>
<p>A speaker from Yue states: &quot;When evils reside in the six yang organs, the Yang pulse becomes disharmonious; if the Yang pulse is disharmonious, qi will accumulate, leading to an excess of Yang, and if Yang is too excessive, Yin energy cannot nourish, resulting in the thinning and depletion of skin and muscles.&quot; The Classics say: &quot;In treating consumption, fatigue, partial paralysis, atrophy, fullness of qi, and rebellious movement in the body, the wealthy who indulge in rich foods suffer these ailments.&quot;</p>
<p>Qibo states: &quot;When the pulse is full, long-lasting illnesses can be treated; when the pulse is thin and small, lasting illnesses are difficult to treat.&quot; The conditions are then classified into three types of thirst. </p>
<p>The first type, known as &quot;upper thirst,&quot; manifests as a red and cracked tongue with great thirst and a desire to drink. The Reverse Regulation Theory states that heat moves from the heart to the lungs, resulting in &quot;diaphragmatic thirst,&quot; which can be treated with Baihu Decoction augmented with ginseng.</p>
<p>The second type, &quot;middle thirst,&quot; involves good appetite but thinness, spontaneous sweating, constipation, and frequent urination. Shuhe states: &quot;Dry mouth with a desire for more water, despite eating plenty, indicates a deficiency type of thirst.&quot;<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To regulate the stomach, use the Shenqi Decoction and Sanyuan Pill. In cases of lower consumption, there is restlessness with a thirst for water, dry ears, and urination resembling grease. Shuhe states: &quot;When there is extreme restlessness, water is easily depleted, indicating kidney consumption.&quot; Treat it with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. The Comprehensive Directory mentions: &quot;If there are the signs of brain abscess and back sores in those able to eat, it is a dire indication; if unable to eat, it points to abdominal fullness and bloating, both signs of untreatability.&quot; The ancient elder Jiegu differentiated treatments: those who can eat but are thirsty should take the White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng; those who cannot eat but are thirsty should take the Qian Family Bai Zhu Powder with an increased dose of Kudzu root. Once the upper and middle levels are balanced, there will be no more lower consumption. Previous physicians had sound intentions in their prescriptions! Some ask: &quot;What are the signs of abscesses and sores in cases of upper consumption?&quot; This is due to the fire pathogen overpowering. The sores are very painful but do not rupture, sometimes with blood-like water. The classic states: &quot;If it has a form but no pain, it belongs to the Yang category.&quot; Attack the Yang urgently, while avoiding the Yin; treatment should focus on the lower regions. When vital energy is strong, there is life; when it is lost, there is death. What is the cause of the fullness in the abdomen for those who have consumed? It is treating cold with heat; even the practitioners cannot abandon established methods in favor of new ones. However, organs have varying distances: the heart and lungs are close, hence should be administered in smaller amounts, while the kidney and liver are farther apart and should receive larger doses, each appropriately considering their conditions. Whether one overdoses or underdoses leads to a situation lacking errors in judgment. For high and middle consumption, if treated too abruptly, the disease may pass quickly, leading to lasting abdominal fullness, which precisely indicates the upper heat has not been resolved while the middle cold has resurfaced. This is not the fault of the medicine but rather a failure to appropriately gauge the urgency of the treatments. Therefore, more attention should be given to the prescribing methods.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiation of Internal and External Injuries</strong></p>
<p>When the external evil of wind and cold affects the body for three days, there is a loss of appetite and reduction of fluids, leading to thirst as the pathogenic qi penetrates inward. In contrast, individuals who suffer internal injuries from imbalanced diet or prolonged labor and illness will not feel thirsty, as the pathogenic qi remains excess within the blood vessels. Initially, those who have been overworked, and whose diet has been irregular, will definitely experience thirst if the damage is severe; this is due to the heart fire blazing upward, attacking the lung metal, hence the thirst. </p>
<p>It is important to discern this. Even if there is a desire to drink cold water, it should be given slowly in small amounts, without yielding to the urge to drink excessively. Too much water can excessively drain the stomach qi, resulting in mild distension or severe transmission of various diseases. The person will inevitably experience recurring disturbances, unrest in the pulse, and increased severity at night, making it difficult to find relief in sleep—this cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Methods</strong><br>If there is fever, aversion to heat, and thirst with red eyes, it indicates an internal disease. The hand taiyin (lung) is deficient and cannot regulate the yang qi. One should use ingredients such as wolfberries, fresh rehmannia, and cooked rehmannia as the main treatment.

All three types of diabetes must avoid the use of Pinellia, and those with blood deficiency should also refrain from its use. Those experiencing dry mouth, throat pain, intestinal dryness, or difficult bowel movements should not use it either, and those with excessive sweating should avoid it. If absolutely necessary, ginger can be employed as a controlling agent. If diabetes presents with diarrhea, first use a powdered mix of Atractylodes and White Peony prepared by frying, then follow it with juices and syrups from previous medications. Additionally, Trichosanthes powder is a superb remedy for diabetes. </p>
<p>In cases of internal injury that leave persistent dryness and thirst, there may be residual heat in the lung meridian; one can use a small amount of ginseng, Poria, and licorice mixed with ginger juice to take cold, or use a teaspoon to add ginger juice to it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the water does not run out, how can one speak of thirst? People indulge in their desires, excessively consume alcohol, and have a strong craving for rich, spicy, preserved, sour, and salty foods. They also use cinnabar and precious stones to satisfy their desires. Consequently, the fiery heat rises, and their internal organs generate heat, becoming dry and scorching, leading to the drying up of fluids, making them crave water yet unable to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>The heat ascends, affecting the heart, which becomes empty and diffuse, unable to contain itself. This results in agitation in the chest, a red tongue, and red lips. They often feel thirsty, need to drink frequently, urinate a little, and this condition, attributed to the upper body, is called &quot;wasting thirst.&quot; </p>
<p>If heat accumulates within, and the spleen is weak, it may produce hunger and lead to excessive eating without gaining flesh. This type of thirst is not very bothersome; they merely desire cold drinks, urinate frequently with sweet-smelling urine, and this condition is attributed to the middle body, called &quot;thirst of the middle.&quot;</p>
<p>If heat settles below, affecting the kidneys, the legs and knees become thin and weak, joints ache, and vital essence is exhausted, leading to a need for water that is not overly frequent and sometimes results in abundant and turbid urination. This condition is attributed to the lower body and is called &quot;thirst of the kidneys.&quot;</p>
<p>If one experiences severe wasting thirst, death could ensue. The treatment should primarily focus on nourishing the spleen with white atractylodes powder to generate bodily fluids. It is also beneficial to cook good quality rice into porridge and eat it to strengthen the kidneys, which helps regulate water. Additionally, a clean preparation of coptis can be ground and placed tightly inside a pig&#39;s stomach, steamed with some rice until soft, then made into pellets the size of a tung seed.

When excessive dampness is present, it should be used; however, if there is no dampness and it is used, it would be a violation of the rules. If urination is not smooth, whether thirsty or not, it indicates the presence of internal damp-heat.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The Door of Thirst</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</p>
<p><strong>Destruction of Thirst</strong></p>
<p>The three types of &quot;thirst&quot; arise from the excess of qi, the deficiency of blood, and the vacuity of energy. If left untreated for a long time, extreme vacuity of qi leads to an inability to take action. One monk exclusively used a modified Astragalus decoction, emphasizing the enhancement of blood. The three types of thirst involve excessive urination. The upper thirst affects the heart, manifesting as fiery heat ascending with great thirst and increased urination. The middle thirst affects the spleen, resulting in warm dryness, increased appetite, and correspondingly excessive urination. The lower thirst affects the kidneys, where kidney weakness prevents water retention, leading to much urination without thirst. However, with frequent urination, body fluids will inevitably be depleted, and over time, one will experience persistent thirst—regardless of previous claims of being &quot;fully quenched,&quot; this is not a valid argument. For the various types of thirst, one should avoid using harsh, drying tonics and instead focus on nourishment. Aside from the spleen type, for the heart and kidney types, it is advisable to use an Astragalus decoction combined with either the Eight Flavor Pill, the Yuan Tu Dan, or the Minor Tu Si Zi Pill. Additionally, Bamboo Dragon Powder can also be used. The Six Divine Decoction is also effective for kidney issues; however, for spleen issues, add Angelica while omitting Astragalus.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is frequent urination from the three types of wasting, there will certainly be constipation. It is advisable to regularly take the Four Substance Decoction to moisten the large intestine. Adding ginseng, papaya, and pollen, then cooking it into porridge with glutinous rice can also be effective. </p>
<p>For those with frequent urination that does not smell foul but instead has a sweet scent, stirring up in the urinal, this illness is severe. Additionally, if there are floating substances on the surface of the urine like pig fat and splashes on the sides of the urinal resembling cypress candle tears, this essence is exhausted, leading to a depletion of true vitality.</p>
<p>In cases of upper and middle wasting, with the heart and spleen being so hot, urination may be scant without restrictions, as there is dryness and heat above and deficiency and cold below, resulting in thirst. </p>
<p>After prolonged wasting, with vital essence and blood depleted, one may experience blindness or paralysis in the hands and feet like a stroke, which is not wind. This symptom of kidney wasting arises from excess. Wasting of the heart often occurs due to excessive desires for food and drink, as well as the consumption of spicy and hot foods. </p>
<p>With excessive drinking, urination also increases. It is essential to suppress heart fire to bring it down; naturally, thirst will decrease. One should use Banxia Xiexin Decoction while removing the dry ginger and adding (herbs) like lou and dried kudzu in appropriate amounts. Swallowing pig’s stomach pills or Jiulian pills, along with alone-tasting Huanglian Decoction, should be brewed many times until cooled. When feeling thirsty, drink freely; over time, this will lead to self-recovery. </p>
<p>Alternatively, porridge made from glutinous rice can be cooked thinly, combined with Ying Soup and Mei Flower Soup, which can be used for those experiencing thirst related to the three types of wasting.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>To alleviate spleen deficiency, due to the spleen channel being dry and hot, food becomes easily digestible, leading to frequent urination and cyclical hunger. Spleen deficiency is classified into three types: deficiency in the middle, deficiency from cold, and deficiency from heat.

<p>If excessive desire leads to disharmony between water and fire, causing kidney water to drain and heart fire to burn, resulting in thirst, cooling heart remedies are not recommended. Instead, one should bolster kidney water to support heart fire.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Summary</strong><br><em>By Lou Ying, Ming Dynasty</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Xiao Ke (Diabetes)</strong>  </p>
<p>Upper Xiao refers to what is known as &quot;ge xiao.&quot; Ge xiao means thirst accompanied by excessive drinking. Middle Xiao is referred to as &quot;xiao zhong.&quot; Xiao zhong means thirst with increased eating and drinking; or drinking alone without thirst. Lower Xiao is referred to as &quot;shen xiao.&quot; Shen xiao means drinking once leads to urination twice, with urine resembling greasy oil. This is a transformation from ge xiao or xiao zhong. Wang’s commentary states: “Lung energy is exhausted and cannot retain.” The lungs store energy, and when they are healthy, they can manage and gather fluids. The refined essence of these fluids nourishes tendons, bones, and blood vessels, while the remainder is expelled as urine. When the lungs are diseased, they cannot manage the fluids, and the refined essence is also lost through urine, leading to excessive urination that resembles greasy oil. Without sufficient fluids to nourish tendons, bones, and blood vessels, diseases manifest gradually, causing thinness and dryness. However, lung diseases originate from kidney deficiency. When the kidneys are deficient, the heart becomes fearful; excessive actions harm the lungs, leading coldness to invade, and then lung disease develops. Thus, Zhong Jing treated thirst with an increased volume of urination using Shenqi Pills to replenish the kidneys and assist the lungs; hence, later generations termed it &quot;shen xiao&quot; and &quot;lower xiao.&quot;<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some say: The scriptures state that when lung consumption leads to death and cannot be treated, why does Zhong Jing use Shen Qi Wan to address it? I say: If the patient drinks one measure and urinates two, it is beyond treatment. However, if they drink one and have not yet urinated twice, the illness is still mild and may be treatable. Thus, Zhong Jing&#39;s Shen Qi Wan is used for conditions where one drinks a斗 (a unit of measure) of water and also urinates a斗 of fluid. If the urine exceeds the intake, it is also beyond assistance.</p>
<p>Irregularity in diet and exhaustion weaken the spleen and stomach, leading to illnesses of blood, which primarily cause the fluids in the mouth to fail to circulate, resulting in dryness of the mouth and throat. The patient mistakenly believes they are thirsty, leading the physician to use Wu Ling San to treat it, which instead exacerbates thirst and dryness, resulting in serious depletion of fluids and risk of death. The scriptures say: &quot;When there is deficiency, one must nourish its mother.&quot; Therefore, one should nourish the heart and small intestine. This is fundamental support for the spleen and stomach, using sweet and warm medicines as the main treatment, bitter cold as the means, and sour as the assisting ministers. When the heart is deficient, one should quickly consume sour substances to gather it; if heart fire is strong, the lung metal suffers from pathogenic influences, and when metal is deficient, it should be nourished with sour substances; then add sweet and warm, and sweet and cold agents, to drain the excess heart fire from the spleen and stomach. This is addressing the root of the issue.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Li Chan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xiaoke (Diabetes)</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The condition called Xiaoke is due to the binding of the two Yangs. The two Yangs refer to the Hand Yangming (large intestine) governing fluids and the Foot Yangming (stomach) governing blood. When fluids and blood are insufficient, it leads to Xiaoke. There is also a condition of dryness and blockage, as the lungs and large intestine are interrelated. </p>
<p>For thirst due to Qi deficiency, it occurs from external pathogens invading inward, or from consuming excessively dry food, causing heat to deplete fluids. Such individuals prefer drinking cold water; they should be given cold and cooling diuretics to clear the heat. Once the heat dissipates, Yin is restored and thirst will subside. </p>
<p>For thirst due to blood deficiency, it is caused by internal injuries or overwork, leading to depletion of spirit and a failure of stomach Qi to rise. This can occur after illness when the stomach is weak and fluids are depleted, or from residual heat in the lungs, resulting in a dry mouth and thirst. Such individuals prefer hot soup; they should be given warming and nourishing agents to replenish Yin. Once Yin is restored, dryness will lessen and thirst will cease.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Xiao&quot; means to burn, akin to how fire cooks and burns. When the three types of Xiao (upper, middle, lower) are balanced, the condition does not descend further. The upper is light, the middle is heavy, and the lower is critical. Ultimately, all arise from the lungs being attacked by fire pathogens, enduring for a long time, causing stagnation of Qi and blood. Thus, those who can eat experience overflow of fluids leading to abscesses; those who cannot eat suffer from distention and increased internal heat. Both conditions are critical.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Urine may be oily, red-yellow, or pale white; it may be accompanied by thirst and frequent urination, or thirst without urination, or urination without thirst. When food and drink enter the stomach, it is like pouring soup on snow, and it is expelled with urine, forming a residue like white fat. Those who grow thinner daily have no remedy. </p>
<p>To treat thirst, initially nourish the lungs and descend the heart, then for a long time nourish the kidneys and strengthen the spleen. The root cause lies in the kidneys, while the symptoms are in the lungs. When the kidneys are warm, qi rises and the lungs are moistened; when the kidneys are cold, qi does not rise and the lungs dry out. Therefore, the Kidney Qi Pill is an excellent remedy for thirst. However, both the heart and kidneys connect through the spleen; nourishing the spleen will naturally produce bodily fluids, as seen in the Ginseng and Atractylodes Powder. For the three types of wasting and thirsting, the use of Single Clam Powder is advised, mixed with water for intake, to restore fluids and quench thirst. The Single (Herb) Stem Pill is a divine remedy for thirst. Avoid 半夏 (Banxia) drying agents.</p>
<p>Water encompasses heaven and earth, and the organs of the human body are also enveloped in fluid and true water. The tangible forms of water, such as exchanges and the earth, are what we consider as water; while the intangible is the water born of the sky, which is qi, linked to the trigram Kan (Water) and Qian (Heaven). To manage the intangible water with the intangible fire, this is known as &#39;Completed Accomplishment.&#39; </p>
<p>For mixed diseases, there is a prevalence of excess thirst and deficient heat, while true heat is less common. After onset of thirst, acupuncture should be avoided, as it may draw out fluids and lead to death.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Upper消 (xiaosh消) refers to a condition where the tongue is red and cracked, leading to extreme thirst. The reverse adjustment theory says that heat from the heart transforms and transmits to the lungs, resulting in upper消. This can be treated with Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction) with added ginseng.</p>
<p>Middle消 (zhongxiaosh消) is characterized by good appetite but thinness, spontaneous sweating, hard stools, and frequent urination. Shuhe states that a dry mouth and increased thirst, along with excessive eating leading to muscular weakness and the formation of middle消, can be treated with Tiaowei Chengqi Decoction.</p>
<p>Lower消 (xiash消) presents with restlessness and thirst, dry and burnt ears, and urination resembling oil. Shuhe indicates that the intense thirst and irritability suggest this is kidney消. It can be treated with Liuwu Wan (Six-Flavor Pill).</p>
<p>The ancient methods to treat the three jiaos (sanjiao) are detailed, but I have another perspective. When a person&#39;s water and fire are balanced, and their qi and blood are adequately nourished, there should be no消. However, if there is improper nourishment, with water and fire imbalanced, fluids become dried out, leading to a fiery upward blaze. Prolonged boiling leads to digestive exhaustion, and the five organs become dry, resulting in emaciation and fatigue. Therefore, the method to treat消 should not divide into upper, middle, or lower; rather, one should prioritize treating the kidney as urgent. Only the Six-Flavor, Eight-Flavor, and modified Eight-Flavor Pills should be taken according to symptoms, reducing heart fire and nourishing kidney water, thus alleviating thirst. Bai Hu and Chengqi should not be used for treatment.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Records&quot; states that those who can&#39;t eat but are thirsty indicate a fullness in the middle that is not transmitted; those who can eat and are thirsty are likely to develop abscesses on the back of the neck. The inability to eat points to a problem with the spleen, which should nourish the surrounding areas and work with the stomach to manage fluids. If both the spleen and stomach are deficient, they cannot distribute their fluids, leading to thirst. Even if a person can eat, it is a sign of a weak stomach trying to remedy itself.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one indiscriminately uses cold and cooling herbs to clear heat, such as the White Tiger Decoction or the Chengqi Decoction, then the internal heat will not be cleared, and cold will reappear, leading to distension—how can that avoid transmission? Only formulas such as the Seven Ingredient Bai Zhu Powder or the Ren Shen Sheng Mai Powder should be used, allowing for ample drinking, while also using the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish the source of transformation. That is the correct method of treatment. If one can eat and feels thirsty, and develops ulcers, that is a disease of the wealthy, indulging in rich foods. They frequently consume sweet and fatty foods, thus their upper qi overflows and causes thirst. One should not take rich foods or fragrant herbs, as their energy is harsh and can exacerbate dryness and heat. The classics say: “To treat it with orchids is to remove the stale qi.” One should also avoid cold and cooling remedies and those that cause abscesses. Why is that? The classics state: “The transformation from rich foods leads to numerous large sores.” That is what is meant.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the kidney is deficient and there are brain abscesses or back sores, it is said that the kidney governs the bones, and the brain is the sea of the kidneys. The back corresponds to the area affected by cold water passing through the Shaoyang channel. When the water is drained and the sea is depleted, and the yin fire rises, how can abscesses and sores not develop? If the sores are severe but do not ulcerate, they may present as red fluid; if extreme, they may appear black or purple. The fire’s intensity resembles the essence of water, indicating that the kidney&#39;s water has been exhausted and cannot be treated. However, if one might strongly replenish the yin, there may still be a chance to save it.</p>
<p>Someone asks: Why do people who take Rehmannia Decoction remain thirsty and cannot be quenched? The answer is: These practitioners cannot abandon their established methods and try a new approach. The heart and lungs are positioned closely, so a smaller dose is appropriate; conversely, the kidney and liver are farther apart, allowing for a larger dose. For conditions with high or middle level consumption, one may use pills in moderation to treat them. However, if lower consumption is at its peak, with great thirst and dryness, one must increase or adjust the eight-flavor pill&#39;s dosage to one sheng, adding one liang of cinnamon, boiling it in six or seven bowls of water, and drinking it iced to indulge. If one sleeps well, their thirst problem will be resolved.</p>
<p>The formulation of prescriptions depends on the adaptability of the person. </p>
<p>Another inquiry: For lower consumption without water, using the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill can nourish the kidney water of the less yin; why add Aconite and Cinnamon? It is because the fire at the Mingmen is weak and cannot transform food and water; the essence of food and water cannot ascend to moisten the lungs, like a cauldron without fuel, leaving the pot dry, hence the thirst.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the lungs, they have nothing to depend on; they are unable to distribute the essence of water evenly, and operate through the five organs. The water one drinks, if not processed by fire, directly enters the bladder, which means drinking one liter results in one liter of urine, and drinking one斗 results in one斗 of urine. If you taste it, it is sweet but not salty, which is evident. Therefore, using the warming and pungent properties of Aconite and Cinnamon strengthens their slight heat. Adding firewood under the stove, as dry rice grains benefit from rain, new life emerges. Only the wise understand this, while the ignorant often consider it impractical. In the past, Emperor Wu of Han suffered from thirst, and Zhang Zhongjing prescribed this formula, now known in the Sacred Yuan Pass, and it can still be recalled today. The Eight Flavor Pill is indeed a good remedy. After wounds and sores heal, and for those who are very thirsty just before recovery, with a yellow, hard tongue; and for those who suffer from thirst beforehand, or those who feel restless and thirsty, with frequent urination, or cloudy discharges, loss of appetite, thin body, swollen legs and thin feet, mouth sores – anyone who takes it will find it effective.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In summary, this concerns the lower burner and the vital gate; when the fire does not return to its origin and wanders in the lungs, it results in upper depletion; when it wanders in the stomach, it results in middle depletion. Using the Eight Flavor Kidney Qi Pill to draw the fire back to its origin allows the fire to settle at the bottom of the cauldron, balancing water and fire. When the Qi rises and steams, the lungs suffer from dampness, leading to thirst and illness recovery. </p>
<p>There is a type of thirst that seeks to drink, but the person quickly becomes weary after just one or two sips of water, soon feeling thirsty again. They can only drink a little, unlike those with true thirst who drink without limit. This indicates a deficiency of middle Qi and coldness, where cold water rises to push against the wandering fire in the throat and tongue; hence, the upper burner craves water for relief. However, reaching the middle burner, the water encounters water and intensifies what is undesirable. Treatment: if the face is red and the person is agitated, administer the Li Zhong Decoction together with the Eight Flavor Pill.</p>
<p>Another type of thirst involves wanting to drink water but immediately vomits it back up after swallowing; shortly after, the person seeks more to drink but can hardly take in any food or medicine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Thirst and Consumption</strong></p>
<p>The affliction of thirst often begins subtly and becomes pronounced, starting in the stomach and culminating in the lungs and kidneys. At first, it is like watering a burning fire; water can still extinguish it. But later, it becomes like pouring water on a stone; when the water is gone, the stone remains unchanged. When drinking and urinating becomes frequent, it consumes the true yin with dryness and fire, leading to exhaustion. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there are discussions but no treatments. The &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; contains both discussions and treatments. However, compilers have conflated the discussions in &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; concerning the Throat Meridian&#39;s thirst, leading later generations to be unable to distinguish appropriateness, which is also unsuitable for application. The transmission of cold damage indicates that when the heat pathogen reaches the Throat Meridian, it is entirely manifested; when heat penetrates deeply, thirst arises and consumption occurs. Once the heat resolves, there is no thirst and no consumption. Is this comparable to conditions arising from accumulated symptoms? I humbly propose a discussion based on the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The texts say that in treating conditions like consumption, collapse, atrophy, weakness, and rebellious qi in the abdomen, afflictions among the wealthy are due to rich foods, which are the sources of consumption. The wealthy who are not overweight may lack fresh food, while the overweight who are not wealthy might overindulge.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Fatty and expensive, rich wine with thick flavor—are these limited in quantity? Over time, consuming them generates internal heat, and bodily fluids dry up, leading one to seek relief from water. However, when water enters, it can still alleviate this, but the more it alleviates, the thirstier one becomes. The richer the food consumed, the worse the inner heat becomes, leading to the illness of internal consumption. Once this internal consumption manifests, it transmits through various pathways, whether upward or downward, especially in areas of intense heat.</p>
<p>Upper consumption occurs when the stomach, heated, affects the lungs, burdening the body. The heart, also heated, transfers this heat to the lungs, resulting in suffering for the metal (lungs). Metal is the source of water that emerges from higher origins. When consumed in the stomach, the essence overflows and rises, the lungs adjust the water pathways downward. Now, when heated, the water from the high source is violently pressured, mixing with externally consumed water, rushing down uncontrollably. Urinating often does not merely fail to eliminate external water, but also exhausts and drains the essence of innate water, leading to significant excess in waste discharge.</p>
<p>Therefore, without treatment, one dies. The so-called &quot;death of yin&quot; related to the heart and lungs, where death can occur within three days, refers to this. Thus, urinating often—first sign of danger.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the stomach, its heat is transmitted down through the gate to the kidneys. The kidneys may be depleted by stone medicine, exhausting their essence. When a woman experiences this, yang is strong externally, while yin cannot maintain itself internally. This leads to cloudy urination like sludge; after drinking, urination occurs frequently, indicating kidney depletion. The classics mention that the nature of stone medicine is harsh, and it is said that the wind from the spleen transmits to the kidneys, causing what is known as hernia and distension, with pain in the lower abdomen and the discharge of white fluid, referred to as &quot;gu.&quot; This clearly indicates kidney depletion. </p>
<p>A physician named He states: Women possess yang; indulgence leads to internal heat and the affliction of &quot;gu.&quot; This elaboration on internal heat and the meaning of &quot;gu&quot; is quite clear. The Grand Minister Wang said: Depletion consumes the flesh like &quot;gu&quot; erodes. This is clearly evident from the term &quot;depletion,&quot; which is rather shallow. Indeed, being obsessed with women&#39;s beauty results in loss of will, and excessive loss of essence leads to turbid fluids, transforming back into a fire, which is the most perilous condition. The classics state: &quot;When the ruler&#39;s fire descends, yin essence supports it.&quot; Therefore, if there is an excess of yin essence, it is sufficient to support heart fire, signifying longevity; if yin essence is insufficient, heart fire will descend directly to the kidneys, leading to a decline in yang essence, resulting in premature death. </p>
<p>Thus, the kidneys serve as the gate of the stomach; if the gate lacks openness, water cannot be released and leads to swelling. If the gate is not closed, water is unceasingly expelled, resulting in thirst. Thirst is a condition belonging to the kidneys; the original text of &quot;Jin Kui&quot; remains unaltered, stating that when one drinks a dou, they urinate a dou, which is governed by kidney qi.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Then steam transforms essence into water, ascending to receive the fire of the ruler, while halting the lower entry of the Yang energy. This is the true communication between heaven and earth. Zhang Zihe dared to disparage it. After denigrating Zhongjing, he praised Hejian, claiming its Shenxiong pill, made with the bitter taste of Huangqin, enters the heart, while Qianniu and Dahuang drive down the fire energy, using Shalstone to channel into the kidney meridian, effectively taking it away from the Kan. This truly grasps the secret of the Huangting. He twists this doctrine to cater to his own preferences, with a shallow understanding that is hardly worthy to enter Zhongjing’s door. He Bai&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Diabetes&quot; has already clarified its errors. Chang Guan&#39;s accounts have never treated diabetes, proving that without the issue, there can be no reasoning behind it. The discussion on fire at the beginning is not without its reason. However, applying the principle of purging Qi to treat vigorous fire leads to no effective result for diabetes. Thus, the fire of below diabetes is akin to fire in water; lowering it only intensifies the burn. The fire of middle diabetes is akin to the draining fire of marshes; lowering it only causes more harm. The fire of upper diabetes is like a wildfire; water that falls from heaven can extinguish it. Merely attacking the intestines and stomach is of no benefit, and instead causes harm. The earth&#39;s energy rises as clouds, and in turn, the heavens’ energy descends as rain; thus, rain arises from the earth&#39;s energy. If the earth’s energy does not rise, can the heavens rain? Therefore, it is imperative to elevate the earth&#39;s energy to nourish the three farmers, as well as to elevate the kidney&#39;s energy to irrigate the three burners—both are necessary truths. Not distinguishing this from the ancients, how can later generations adhere to what is clear?<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Continuation of the Discussion</h3>
<p>In &quot;On Thirst,&quot; Chang discusses the essence of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; stating that it begins in the stomach and culminates in the lungs and kidneys, defining the three areas of consumption as being upper and middle. Other conditions like diaphragm consumption and food-related issues are also just forms of upper and middle consumption. However, without practical references from the &quot;Essential Prescription,&quot; my heart remained unsatisfied. Two years later, I suddenly remembered the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; stating: when there is labor and fatigue, the physical energy diminishes, and the energy of grains is not abundant. The upper burner does not function well, the stomach&#39;s energy is hot, and this heat disturbs the chest, resulting in internal heat. I realized that the disease in the chest is solely due to the energy of food and grain in the stomach, which circulates and nourishes the chest, allowing for clarity and brightness to manifest in one&#39;s own body.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is fatigue or weariness that harms the fundamental energy and vital essence, then the energy in the chest becomes weak; the digestive energy in the stomach thereby does not thrive. When the digestive energy does not thrive, the injured energy in the chest becomes even harder to recover, and cannot be adequately replenished. Consequently, the digestive energy remains stagnant in the stomach, causing stagnation and heat within. This heat then pervades the chest, mixing with the weakened energy and transforming into internal heat. The balance between the chest and stomach becomes unsettled, making it impossible to avoid thirst and depletion. </p>
<p>Understanding this key point clarifies what has been previously misunderstood in the &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; text. It states: if the pulse at the wrist is floating and slow, the floating indicates deficiency, and the slow indicates fatigue. Deficiency implies insufficient protective energy, and fatigue means that the nourishing energy is depleted. If the pulse at the foot is floating and rapid, the floating signifies energy, and the rapid indicates that the digestive process is impaired and there is excessive solidity; abundant energy results in quick urination, and quick urination indicates solidity. When solidity and rapidity collide, this signifies thirst.</p>
<p>By examining the wrist pulse, one can assess the energy in the chest; by examining the pulse at the foot, one can assess the energy in the stomach. Clearly, there is a pulse to follow and evident signs to observe, yet it is difficult to discern the subtleties. The essence lies in the fact that yin resides within, safeguarding the yang; yang is outside, reinforcing the yin. A floating pulse at the wrist indicates that yin is not properly maintaining itself internally, thus, the yang in the external protective layer is floating and signifies deficiency. A slow pulse at the wrist indicates that yang is not effectively anchored externally, therefore, the yin safeguarding internally is slow and signifies fatigue. Overall, it is the injury of nourishing and protective energies that causes the wrist pulse to be deficient and slow. The nourishing energy pertains to the essence of food and water, while the protective energy pertains to their robust qualities. When both are deficient and slow, the energy from food and water fails to rise and fills the interior with stagnation, which is already evident of a weak diaphragm and stomach heat.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In addition to the floating pulse of the Fuyang meridian, when it is floating it represents Qi, which corresponds to the changes described in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding heat Qi scorching the chest; when it is rapid, it indicates the consumption of food and the presence of a large hardness. In the earlier discussion, it is like water being poured over a stone: when the water is gone, the stone remains unchanged. This coincides with the presence of hardness in the stomach, where food is consumed but water is not, illustrating that the heat of fire can consume water, while water can quench thirst. When the stomach is hard and dry, it does not absorb water; instead, it is driven by the force of heat, leading to rapid urination, resulting in frequent urination. This depletion exacerbates dryness, thus the hardness and frequency clash, constituting thirst. Directly referencing the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; excessive bitterness, prolonged exposure to heat transforms it, and the spleen&#39;s Qi is not moistened, leading to a thickened stomach Qi — this is the source of thirst, both subtle and significant. After the Jin and Tang dynasties, while there were many who were wise and insightful, interpreting the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; each rising figure became notable in their own right, yet none entered the profound teachings of Zhang Zhongjing, as what they obtained from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; was shallow. Had they delved deeper, they could have correlated conditions, compared symptoms, and derived treatments based on pulse and symptomology to clarify established methods, but the remnants of the &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; have been passed down and recited in households.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as in cases of thirst, it is traditionally said that those with mid-thirst should be treated with purgatives, adhering to this principle without other considerations. Can one resolve the issue with just one treatment? Or should it be approached progressively? The stomach has become large and firm and does not accept nourishment easily; just administering purgatives may not yield results. The firm does not respond, while the weak does. The bladder does not act, but the large intestine does; could this not lead to complications driven by the medication, resulting in issues like fullness and swelling? The &quot;Comprehensive Record&quot; states: those who are able to eat but develop boils will inevitably suffer from severe swelling; those who cannot eat will certainly experience abdominal fullness and bloating, all of which are signs of an illness that cannot be treated. Various schools do not focus on the initial stages of the disease but rather on the later stages, employing many treatments like honeysuckle, blue leaves, and herbal pills, as well as combinations for abdominal fullness. What is their intention? The &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; suggests that in instances of slight urinary discomfort, one should early on use only clam as treatment, which is not mentioned in published formulas. Little do they know that softening and firming substances, if not treating deficiency can injure it, while this particular one is benign, effective for diuresis, and truly precious! Jiegao states: for those who can eat but are thirsty, one should use White Tiger Decoctio with ginseng. For those who cannot eat but are thirsty, one should use the Qian family&#39;s white atractylodes powder with kudzu root. The late-stage boils are a result of excessive fire; one must urgently attack the Yang, not the Yin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the medical philosophy regarding the treatment of illnesses associated with excess heat and cold in the body. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the illness and the appropriate treatment methods. It criticizes rushing to use remedies without considering their effects on the body.

The mention of the three types of wasting diseases (消) relates to fire pathology, arguing that one must recognize how heat impacts different organs and should treat accordingly. It warns against merely addressing symptoms without understanding the root causes, illustrating the complexity of balancing yin and yang within the body.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;two Yangs&quot; refers to the Yangming. The Yangming of the hand rules the large intestine and governs fluids; when disease leads to deficiency, one experiences yellowing of the eyes and dryness of the mouth, indicating insufficient fluids. The Yangming of the foot governs the stomach and rules the blood; when disease is hot, there is a tendency for excessive hunger and a lurking fire in the blood, indicating insufficient blood. A blockage arises from a lack of fluids and blood; when blocked and not moving, it is a disease caused by dryness.</p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: the heart transfers heat to the lungs, which results in diaphragm dysfunction. Zhang Zihe suggests that diaphragm dysfunction has not yet reached the lungs; when the heart transfers cold to the lungs, this constitutes lung dysfunction. By muddying the text, one misunderstands the &quot;Neijing.&quot; How could it be that the heart transfers heat to the lungs, and the lungs pass that heat to the diaphragm, but it has not yet affected the lungs? It is necessary to change the text to state that the heart transfers heat to the diaphragm, which then transmits it to the lungs, thereby avoiding confusion. </p>
<p>It must be understood that the heart and lungs both reside above the diaphragm, with the lungs being a delicate organ. Cold and heat can easily enter; however, when cold pathogens enter, they are bound externally, while hot pathogens enter and transmit outward. Both affect the lung tips, but treatment must differentiate them.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The conditions known as &quot;Three Privations&quot;—namely, consuming thirst, consuming in the middle, and consuming of the kidneys—are categorized as such. Can there truly be a consumption of the middle and lower without thirst? It is stated in the texts that thirst can arise from various causes: heart and lung qi stagnation leading to thirst, liver blockage causing thirst, heat obstruction leading to thirst, stomach and large intestine heat causing thirst, spleen blockage resulting in thirst, kidney heat causing thirst, and small intestine heat causing thirst. The more one examines these causes, the more one finds them lacking in clarity regarding consuming thirst, merely citing thirst as a manifestation of dryness and heat depleting fluids, which is indeed puzzling. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Essentials of the Jade Mechanism,&quot; there is a deep discussion on this, erroneously attributing the cure for consumption to warming remedies for the kidneys; I am unsure what such warming medicines truly entail. Is there any reasoning in the world that a warming remedy could treat consuming thirst? The implication likely lies in the fact that it is not based on the &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; principle of Kidney Qi Pills. Yet Kidney Qi Pills invigorate kidney water and are known as the miraculous remedy for consuming thirst, recognized by later generations. Why then does Bai Zhai further elaborate on this? </p>
<p>I am concerned that later scholars might casually come across the discussions of Zi He and Zong Hou, which might confuse and mislead them further, prompting me to restate this point. The condition called &quot;Dampness&quot; leads to consuming in the middle, with intense stomach heat and excessive stomach fire, resulting in an increased appetite and thirst. Various schools suggest the use of Major Decoction to Purge for treatment. However, they fail to recognize that the accumulated heat, which has gradually developed, and the inherent fire will not be resolved by aggressive purging. Merely purging will be harmful to the intestines and stomach and will worsen the discomfort.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when necessary to use rhubarb, it must be long steamed to harmonize its properties. Moreover, it should not be combined with bitter orange or amomum, as this would exacerbate the urgency of the illness. The ancient remedy known as &quot;Shunli Powder&quot; implies a gentle approach, avoiding aggression. </p>
<p>The formula states: for treating internal heat in the stomach that affects appetite, with slight yellowish red urine and minimal urination, if one loses the desire to eat, it should not be overutilized. I fear that minimal urination leading to loss of appetite indicates that the stomach qi is already depleted. The method of purging medicine is not to be recklessly applied. </p>
<p>You harmonize this formula into &quot;Jiajian Sanyuan Pill,&quot; combining rhubarb with Scutellaria and Coptis, while not using bitter orange or amomum. The formula also addresses the toxicity and heat caused by mineral medications. By intuition, it must be used with substantial effectiveness, considering whether the condition of dryness is due to the body&#39;s genuine qi being consumed by excessive heat. Is there truly anyone of substantial build? </p>
<p>Thus, to eliminate the heat from the stomach, what must be done? I believe that prolonged steaming of rhubarb, combined with licorice, can provide a balanced approach to quickening and soothing. When used with ginseng, it can simultaneously attack and tonify, similar to enhancing agricultural production in a prosperous land, enduring initial challenges, thereby hoping for benefits over three years. Currently, even if there are opportunities for quick gains, they should not be pursued, as how could one expect immediate results?

<p>The illness of the three types of diabetes is related to the three burners. The upper diabetes, characterized by extreme thirst, leads to constant drinking; this depletes the fluids in the upper burner. It has been said that the disease lies in the lungs, yet it is also due to the heat from the heart and spleen, which can scorch these areas, hence it is also called phlegm diabetes. The middle diabetes pertains to the middle burner, where excessive eating leads to hunger without increasing flesh, resulting in gradual weight loss; this disease is located in the spleen and stomach, also referred to as ingestion diabetes. The lower diabetes concerns the lower burner, where urine is yellow and turbid, sometimes resembling fat or grease, with the face dark and ears scorched, involving gradual weight loss; this ailment is in the kidneys, thus also known as kidney diabetes. </p>
<p>The ancients recognized all three types as manifestations of fire disease, yet there are cases of real fire caused by excess heat, and instances of false fire from insufficient true yin. If one treats diabetes without distinguishing between excess and deficiency, errors are inevitable. Understanding the distinctions of yin and yang in diabetes is crucial. For example, excessive thirst is termed &quot;thirst diabetes,&quot; excessive hunger is termed &quot;grain diabetes,&quot; and turbid urine resembling fat indicates &quot;kidney diabetes.&quot;<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All of this arises mainly because a strong fire leads to a deficiency of yin, which is a sign of the consumption of yang. However, the meaning of yin consumption is not well understood by many. Consumption refers to both dissolution and depletion. Any decline and failure of the yin-yang, blood, or qi is termed consumption, so one cannot entirely explain it in terms of fire. How can this be demonstrated? For instance, the theory of qi collapse states: &quot;When the heart is influenced by cold in the lungs, it leads to lung consumption; after drinking one or two urinations, death occurs without treatment.&quot; This is precisely due to the decline of foundational qi, leading to coldness in metal and water; thus, water fails to transform into qi, while all qi transforms into water. Isn&#39;t this a manifestation of yin deficiency presenting as a sign of yang? Furthermore, the chapter on pathogenic influences in organs says: &quot;When the pulses of the five organs are thin and small, it signifies consumption and stagnation.&quot; Can one consider these thin pulses as signs of excess yang? This clearly illustrates the concept of yin consumption in the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; which is not well comprehended by people. Therefore, when treating the three signs of consumption, one must observe the pulses and the nature of the disease. If one only notes the deficiency of foundational qi and associated signs of false heat, they must swiftly address the root cause to nourish the source of transformation. Merely recognizing the condition as fire and focusing on clearing it will inevitably result in both yin and yang failing.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>In terms of treatment methods for bodily fluids, the foremost step is to discern between deficiency and excess. If, upon examining the pulse and symptoms, it is confirmed that genuine fire causes the depletion of fluids, then simply removing the fire will allow fluids to regenerate, stopping the thirst. If the issue arises from insufficient true water, this is entirely a matter of yin deficiency, regardless of whether it pertains to the upper, middle, or lower levels. It is crucial to treat the kidneys, ensuring that the yin energy gradually replenishes and the essence and blood recover, thereby letting the illness heal naturally. If one only focuses on clearing fire, there will be no support for yin to generate, and the deterioration will be increasingly apparent, leading to more distress.</p>
<p>Upper consumption leads to excessive thirst, while middle consumption results in excessive hunger. Although it is said that upper consumption pertains to the lungs and middle consumption to the stomach, fundamentally, the fire within the upper and middle burners is merely the stomach fire raging upwards. Therefore, minor distinctions in treatment are necessary. If both burners are indeed affected by excess fire, then White Tiger Decoction is appropriate for both. If there is more thirst than hunger, especially with illness predominantly in the lungs, then Ginseng White Tiger Decoction should be used. If water is deficient in the lower burner and fire is flaming in the upper burner, and there is a need to clear it, then Jade Maiden Decoction or a modified version of One-Yin Decoction should be administered.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One says: The thirst in the upper burner is caused by the heart fire injuring the metal. It is advisable to lower the fire and clear the metal using ingredients like orchid leaves, white glossy privet flowers, yellow coptis, and anemarrhena, adding a little asarum to guide the clear qi upward and alleviate thirst. This approach can also be appropriately used. </p>
<p>For the symptom of deficiency fire in the middle burner, characterized by being hungry yet thin, the ancient method directly uses formulas like the Stomach Harmonizing and Qi Regulating Decoction and San Huang Wan. However, since there is already good hunger, there should be no stagnation. If there is no stagnation, it is best to clear the fire; it is not suitable to attack the fire. Without symptoms like clumping and obstruction, using these two formulas may not be appropriate. If it is indeed due to stomach fire with no deficiency symptoms, then formulas like San Bu Wan, Yu Quan San, Bai Hu Tang, and Chou Xin Yin can all be considered for use. </p>
<p>For the symptom of lower burner deficiency, where the urination is turbid like grease or oil, and there may be additional symptoms of restlessness and buzzing in the ears, this indicates depletion of kidney water. The ancient method uses formulas like Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to address this, which is indeed appropriate. However, from my observation, it is also necessary to distinguish between cold and heat, slick and turbid, and to treat them accordingly, so as to achieve the best outcome.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is turbid urine like mucus, accompanied by heat and fire, it is advisable to supplement and also clear. One can use a formula such as Yiyin Decotion or Bunyin Pills, Dabu Yinjian, or Liuwei Dihuang Wan with Huangbai and Zhimu. If there is downward leakage and accompanying difficulty in urination, it is necessary to supplement and facilitate, primarily using formulas like Liuwei Dihuang Wan. If there is turbid urine in the lower burner with no fire, it is due to the inability of qi to contain essence, and one should focus on strengthening water and nourishing qi, using formulas like Zuo Gui Yin or Dabu Yuan Jian. If fire diminishes and cannot transform qi, and qi deficiency cannot transform fluids, one should still use formulas like You Gui Yin, You Gui Wan, or Bamei Dihuang Wan. If there is no fire in the lower burner but there is slippage, the main focus should be on consolidating the kidneys and supplementing yin, using formulas like Miyuan Jian, Gu Yin Jian, and Qinzhu Tusi Wan. </p>
<p>Regarding the three types of excesses, ancients categorized the upper burner with the lungs, the middle burner with the stomach, and the lower burner with the kidneys, often treating primarily with fire, which is indeed appropriate. However, in my view, the fire of the three burner&#39;s path often has its disease rooted in the kidneys, and it is invariably related to the vital gate.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Gate of Life is the organ of water and fire. When there is a deficiency of water, it can certainly cause consumption and thirst; similarly, when there is a deficiency of fire, it can also lead to consumption and thirst. Why is this the case? It is because when water fails to support fire, fire cannot return to its source. Therefore, fire may wander to the lungs causing upper consumption, or to the stomach causing middle consumption, or it may consume the essence of yin causing lower consumption. These are all manifestations of true yin deficiency and indicate that water is insufficient, leading to consumption.</p>
<p>Moreover, when yang fails to transform qi, water essence cannot be distributed. Water without fire cannot rise but only descend, resulting in direct entry into the bladder causing scanty urination, leading to a depletion of the springs and desiccation of the earth. This too is a manifestation of true yang deficiency, indicative of downwards fire deficiency causing consumption. </p>
<p>For yin deficiency-based consumption, treatment should focus on nourishing water, as has been advised by many. However, when it comes to yang deficiency-induced consumption, people often doubt the need to replenish fire. They do not realize that adding fuel beneath a cauldron enhances the steam, that dried grains gain life from rain, and that growth returns to the peaks—these are all the workings of yang energy and represent subtle balances of life and death. </p>
<p>Because consumption signs are often due to deficiency and cannot withstand excessive depletion, if one does not seek the root causes of this depletion and continues to drain the vital energy, the consumption will worsen and recovery will be impossible. Therefore, I write this again to inform the discerning.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secrets of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Treatment for Diabetes</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of diabetes, although categorized into upper, middle, and lower types, all fundamentally stem from kidney deficiency causing thirst, and there is no difference in this regard. Therefore, the primary method for treating diabetes should focus on nourishing the kidneys, without needing to distinguish between the types. I possess a particularly remarkable formula called &quot;Combined Treatment Decoction.&quot; It consists of three taels of cooked Rehmannia, two taels each of Cornelian cherry and Ophiopogon, five qian of Plantago seeds, and one tael of Yuanshen, boiled in water and consumed daily. This will naturally cure the three types of diabetes. This formula nourishes the kidneys while also addressing excess heat. It seems suitable for those with kidney fire, but one must understand that the symptoms of diabetes cannot materialize without a fire element. I replenish water while reducing fire, allowing the excess heat to exit through the bladder while the true energy remains intact, making recovery from diabetes easier. Why complicate matters by adding more herbs like cinnamon? However, for those who have suffered long-term from diabetes and experience extreme cold in the lower body, this formula may include an additional two qian of cinnamon, if such an abnormal condition arises. If one does not follow my proportions and recklessly adjusts the ingredients, it will lead to swift death—how can one hope for survival? The symptoms of diabetes, although classified into upper, middle, and lower categories, ultimately reflect an insufficiency of kidney water. If one uses fire-clearing and thirst-quenching medications, it will further deplete the yin, inevitably augmenting the fire, which could lead to severe thirst and death. The treatment must focus on replenishing the water within the kidneys; sufficient water will naturally extinguish the fire. However, this fire is not real fire; true fire can be extinguished by cold, while虚火 (fictitious fire) must be drawn out by fire itself.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One must also replenish the fire in the kidneys, as the fire warms the life gate; when the lower heat is addressed, the upper heat naturally resolves. This prescription is called &quot;Fire-Attracting Yin Decoction,&quot; consisting of two taels of Yuan Shen, two qian each of cinnamon and northern five-flavor fruit, four qian of Shan Zhu Yu, one tael each of cooked earth and Mai Dong, five qian of Ba Ji Tian, all decocted in water for consumption. This formula greatly replenishes the water in the kidneys while warming the fire of the life gate, drawing the fire back to its source and allowing the fire energy to dissipate on its own. It is unnecessary to specifically quench thirst; the thirst will resolve itself, and it is not necessary to specifically subside heat; the heat will heal itself.</p>
<p>For severe thirst, gypsum must be used, often accumulating to a pound over the course of a day and night. When heat is at its extreme, heavy medication is unavoidable. At this time, it is essential to avoid excessive conversation; otherwise, it could be fatal. However, this type of condition is extremely rare, occurring only once in a multitude of cases, and should not be applied indiscriminately to those with general stomach heat.</p>
<p>For severe thirst, using gypsum to calm stomach heat is widely known, yet some may not understand its reason. When stomach heat surges uncontrollably, it is akin to a fire ravaging the wilderness; it requires a torrential rain to dampen and extinguish it. The use of gypsum is thus a temporary measure, often effective in the short term, but it must not be used long term as it leads to ruin.</p>
<p>There is also another formula passed down as a clinical reference. For unceasing severe thirst, use several taels of gypsum, three qian of Zhi Mu, a pinched amount of glutinous rice, three taels of Mai Dong, several taels of Ren Shen, to be used alongside gypsum, with three qian of Ban Xia, one qian of Gan Cao, one hundred pieces of bamboo leaves, and two taels of Yuan Shen, all decocted in water for consumption.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

Honeysuckle can be used regardless of quantity; roots, stems, flowers, and leaves are all applicable.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In ancient times, a certain Hanzi Yufu, over sixty years old and with three ailments, suffered from diabetes. As winter approached, he developed heat and restlessness, needing to uncover himself and spraying his chest and armpits with ice water for relief. He consumed several bowls of meat and noodles daily, quickly feeling hunger again. After more than a month, he sought my treatment. Upon diagnosis, I found his pulse to be deep, thin, and rapid, determining it was a terminal condition. His son Yufu and brother kneeled in front of me, saying: &quot;The illness is indeed serious. Although your efforts may be in vain, we will have no regrets.&quot; I replied: &quot;The condition called diabetes has many names: it is called ‘excessive thirst,’ ‘digestive wasting,’ or ‘exhaustion disease.’ This is caused by an indulgent diet. The yangming transforms into dry fire, which prevents bodily fluids from maintaining, leading to spontaneous sweating and frequent urination. Therefore, drinking leads to urination more than once. Stomach heat causes food to be improperly digested, leading to hunger despite eating, and resulting in weight loss. Shuhe mentions that excessive eating can also cause weakness, which is true. This condition is what Zhongjing referred to as &#39;severe in spring and summer, mild in autumn and winter,&#39; indicating the influence of seasonal changes. Your father is currently worsening as the seasons change, with kidney water depleted and unable to control the excessive heat of the heart at a time of its strength. The classic texts state: &#39;When one cannot control what is usually stronger, it’s called true excess, indicating loneliness of yang without yin.&#39; Furthermore, a person is the master of their body while external forces are temporary guests; this severe winter cannot suppress internal heat. How can any medicine help? The texts say: &#39;The master overcomes the adverse, while the guest follows.&#39; Therefore, treatment would only be futile, so I declined and left. Soon after, a different doctor was consulted, and within a few days, he passed away.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

Examination of his pulse revealed a weak and thin left pulse and a slightly rapid right pulse, showing strength but slightly heavy. The left pulse was somewhat weak but not thin; however, the weakness was more pronounced on the left, indicating damp heat caused by rich food. He was advised to avoid rich flavors, reduce heat to clear the lungs, and restrain the liver to nourish the spleen, using Sanxiao pills, ten pills, along with five pills each of Zhujin and Awei pills, taken with ginger decoction six times a day. Additionally, he was to take Siwu decoction with added ginseng, atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, sweet licorice, schizandra, and ophiopogon, three times a day, alternating with the pills. After one or two days, he felt much better, with his urination reduced by two-thirds and his mouth not dry; however, his thirst was unchanged, and he experienced dizziness and lower back pain from sitting too long. He thus used a topical remedy for his back pain and continued with the Siwu decoction, reducing the chuanxiong while adding niuxi, schizandra, and roasted huangbo, prepared as a decoction, and took Liu Yi powder as needed.

He drank water continuously, experienced frequent urination, and had constipation. His saliva was profuse, his face was flushed, his tongue was prickly, and his lips were dry and cracked. He felt heat throughout his body, sometimes like a stabbing pain without a fixed location, and the soles of his feet felt as if they were burnt. Cold treatments provided pain relief, and his pulse was strong and unregulated. This indicated a deficiency of kidney yin, with yang not being anchored and manifesting outwardly, not fire per se. The extreme heat was significant; the cold was insufficient, indicating a lack of water, so he needed to vigorously replenish his yin.</p>
<p>Therefore, he prepared a dose of modified Eight Valuable Herbs Pills weighing one pound, including one tael of cinnamon, and decocted it with water into six bowls, giving him the cool mixture to drink. After consuming half, he had a bowl of warm porridge before sleeping until evening, then took another bowl of the warm decoction and slept until dawn, after which he consumed two bowls of hot porridge, and all symptoms subsided. </p>
<p>The next day, he felt cold, and his feet were cold up to his knees, with symptoms returning; some believed it to be a case of cold damage. However, I said: &quot;It isn&#39;t that. The cold is extreme, yet the heat isn&#39;t actual heat; thus, there is no fire, and yang energy is also deficient.&quot; He urgently took one dose of the Eight Valuable Herbs Pills, which eased him slightly, and after four doses, the symptoms receded again. </p>
<p>When his bowel movements were blocked for thirteen days, he used pig bile to induce them, and symptoms reappeared. Urgently, he took several doses of the Complete Nutritional Decoction, which proved effective.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; states: In the capital, there was a man named Zhou Gong from the left side of the mountain, over forty years old. Due to accumulated paperwork and fatigue, he developed a wasting illness, experiencing fatigue, reduced appetite, and frequent fears. From winter through spring to summer, he had not slept a full night for over six months. In his upper body, he experienced no thirst and had little desire for hot water; if he drank a little, it would not move through him. However, every night he had to urinate two to three liters, yet no one knew where it was coming from. His urine was thick as cream, and he was extremely emaciated, certain he would die. I examined him, and although his pulse was still somewhat slow, his flesh had not wasted away completely. It seemed his stomach energy was still present. I used Gui Pi Decoction without wood fragrance, along with other nourishing tonics, one to nourish yang and the other to nourish yin, alternating between them. After more than three hundred doses and about twenty pounds of ginseng, he was fully cured. This is a case of spirit consuming from above and essence diminishing from below. It shows that consumption has both yin and yang, and cannot simply be described as heat.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

A full and large pulse indicates that the essence and blood are still abundant, thus it can be treated. A weak and thin pulse indicates a gradual decline in essence and energy, making treatment difficult.] In treating consumption, collapse, paralysis, atrophy, qi obstruction, rebellion, the illness of the wealthy and plump is that of sorghum. **Discussion on Qi Obstruction** When the heart's coldness moves to the lungs, the lungs consume. If the lungs consume, drinking does not help, and death is inevitable. [Note: The lungs are the source of metal and water. Coldness from heart fire diminishes lung essence, so drinking does not help, leading to death as there is no remedy.] When the heart's heat moves to the lungs, this causes diaphragm consumption. [Note: The heart and lungs are situated above the diaphragm; when fire heat transfers to the lung metal, the fluid of metal and water gets depleted, leading to exhaustion of the fluids above the diaphragm, causing thirst.] **Discussion on Treating Heat** In cases of kidney heat illness, there is first pain in the lower back and aching kidneys, intense thirst, frequent drinking, and body heat. [Note: The lower back is the area of the kidneys, hence the pain here first. The kidneys govern the bones, thus the aching. The kidneys are water organs; when fluids cannot ascend, it leads to intense thirst and frequent drinking.] **Discussion on Yin and Yang Differences** The convergence of two Yangs is called consumption.

When Yangming qi is obstructed, the fluids from food and water do not produce, leading to thirst as a result.]"},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Wind** Wind caused by drinking alcohol is termed \"leakage of wind.\" The symptoms of wind leakage may include excessive sweating, an inability to wear a single garment, sweating after eating, severe sweating of the body, breathlessness, aversion to wind, damp clothing, dry mouth, and thirst, leading to an inability to engage in labor. **Discussion on Strange Illnesses** The Emperor asked, \"What is the name of the illness characterized by a sweet mouth? How does one contract it?\" Qibo replied, \"This is an overflow of the five vital energies, known as 'spleen dampness.' When five flavors enter the stomach, they are stored there, and the spleen facilitates the movement of their essence and energy. The fluids in the spleen cause the mouth to taste sweet, indicating an abundance of richness. Such individuals often consume sweet and rich foods. Excessive richness leads to internal heat, while sweetness causes fullness, hence their energy overflows and turns into diabetes. Treat this with orchid, to disperse the stagnant qi.\" **Discussion on Essential Truths** For the Shaoyang recovery, the throat is parched and dry, leading to thirst for liquids. The throat's dryness indicates damage to the lung’s metal element. Thirst for liquids indicates dryness in the stomach and metal. The Taiyang governs the heavens, causes the throat to dry and parched, and if severe, the complexion flushes, leading to thirst and a desire to drink. This is because the cold affects the heart fire, forcing the fire energy to rise and become inflamed."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Qi Transformation and Changes** In years when the water element is excessively strong and cold air prevails, it harms the heart fire, causing the people to suffer from thirst and to err in their judgments.

Shao Yu replied: Those whose five organs are soft and weak are prone to consumption. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we know the softness and weakness of the five organs? Shao Yu replied: If someone is soft and weak, there must be strength somewhere. Strength often leads to anger, while softness is easily harmed. The Yellow Emperor asked: How do we differentiate between softness and strength? Shao Yu replied: This person's skin is thin, yet their eyes are deep and firm; they show an upright and assertive demeanor, indicating a strong heart. When strong, one is often angry, and anger causes the qi to reverse and accumulate in the chest, leading to turbulent blood flow. The hip skin becomes filled with muscle, and the blood vessels become stagnant, turning into heat, which then harms the skin, resulting in consumption. [Note: According to this text, there are two types of consumption: one regarding the five organs and the other regarding the muscles. Consumption of the five organs happens within, leading to thirst, while muscle consumption occurs externally, leading to emaciation. When essence and blood are deficient, it causes reverse qi to ascend, hence it is said that the soft and weak must have strength; it refers to the essence of the five organs being soft, while the qi is strong. Thus, the softer one becomes weaker, and the stronger one becomes stronger, leading to disharmony between strength and softness.]"},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"**Section on Organs** If the heart is weak, it is prone to disorders like wasting thirst and internal heat.

(Note: \"Bian\" refers to the reversal of one's condition. Heat counters cold, and cold counters heat.) **Section on the Manifestations of Evil Qi in Organs** A faint pulse in the heart signifies wasting thirst; a very slippery pulse indicates excessive thirst. (Note: Wasting thirst refers to the symptoms of the three types of wasting. The heart and lungs govern upper wasting, the spleen and stomach govern middle wasting, while the liver and kidneys govern lower wasting.

The kidney pulse is small, indicating a deficiency of essence and blood. --- **On the Five Flavors** The Yellow Emperor said: Salty flavors expedite blood circulation; consuming a lot of this causes thirst. Why is this? Lesser Yu replied: Salty flavors enter the stomach, and their energy rises through the Middle Jiao, flowing into the pulses, thus causing blood and energy to move. When blood mixes with salty flavors, it coagulates; coagulation leads to the juices in the stomach being depleted, and when depleted, the throat becomes dry, resulting in a dry tongue that craves water. The blood vessels belong to the pathway of the Middle Jiao, therefore salty flavors enter and expedite blood circulation. **Notes**: When salty flavors enter the stomach, their energy rises through the Middle Jiao and flows into the pulses, which is the nature of salinity rising. This affects blood and energy. Blood is the essence of the Middle Jiao, nourishing the spirit and transforming into red; since salty is associated with the taste of cold water, when blood and salt combine, it coagulates. This leads to dryness and blockage, depleting the juices in the stomach. When the juices are exhausted, the throat becomes dry, hence the tongue becomes dry and craves water."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**Essentials of the Gold Coffer** 【Han - Zhang Ji】 **Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus** The section on diabetes states: The illness of Jueyin manifests as diabetes, where qi rises to the heart, causing pain and heat within the heart, hunger without the desire to eat, and upon eating, one vomits worms; the condition does not cease with purging. The pulse at the inch position is floating and slow; floating indicates deficiency and slow indicates labor; deficiency suggests inadequate defensive qi, while labor implies exhausted qi. The Fuyang pulse is floating and rapid; floating denotes qi, and rapid suggests the consumption of grains leading to rigidity. When the qi is excessive, urination is frequent; frequent urination with hardness indicates diabetes. For men with diabetes, if urination is excessive—drinking one dou leads to urinating one dou—Kidney Qi Pills are indicated. If the pulse is floating and urination is difficult, with slight heat and diabetes, it is advisable to promote urination and induce sweating, using the Wuling Powder.

The chapter on Lung Atrophy states: if heat is in the upper jiao, it causes cough leading to lung atrophy. How does one contract lung atrophy?

The Treatise on Phlegm and Fluid states that when there is retained fluid in the chest, the person will experience shortness of breath, thirst, and pain in the joints of the limbs, with a deep pulse indicating the presence of fluid retention. If the person becomes thirsty first and then vomits, it indicates water accumulation in the lower part of the heart, belonging to the category of fluids; Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction is employed for treatment. The Treatise on Water Qi states that in a case of taiyang disease with a floating and tight pulse accompanied by chills, this results from extreme deficiency leading to sweating. When thirsty without chills, it indicates skin edema; in such cases, thirst with diarrhea and frequent urination indicates that sweating should be avoided. For interior water retention, the body will show yellow swelling in the face and eyes, with a deep pulse and difficulty in urination, indicating the presence of fluid.

The \"Vomiting Treatise\" states: If vomiting precedes thirst, this is a desire for relief. If thirst precedes vomiting, this indicates water is stagnant in the heart; it pertains to those with drinking issues. If someone originally feels thirsty but now has no thirst, it is due to stagnant drinking water in the heart; this relates to obstructed drinking.

Although great cold may freeze the sea, it does not freeze the alcohol; this demonstrates the inherently hot nature of alcohol, with nothing to add to it. Salty dried meats and roasted foods are flavors that drinkers crave, never leaving their lips. After three cups, self-control is lost. When drinking and eating with abandon, chewing sauces without discerning their acidity or saltiness, along with countless nights of indulgence, the three burners become intensely heated, and the five organs dry out. Even wood and stone may scorch; how can a person avoid thirst? Whether treated or not depends on the patient. If one can be diligent and cautious, healing may occur in a few months. However, if one does not take care, death will come swiftly. Medical texts contain many effective prescriptions; but what of those who do not exercise caution? The precautions are threefold: first, to avoid drinking; second, to be restrained in sexual activity; and third, to avoid salty foods and flour. Those who can heed these precautions may not need medicine to find relief. Those unaware of this, even with elixirs, cannot be saved. Reflect deeply and exercise caution! Also, for those suffering from thirst, whether healed or not, one must always consider the possibility of significant abscesses. Why? Because in individuals with thirst, abscesses often develop between the major joints, leading to sudden acute complications; thus, one should prepare abscess remedies in advance to prevent them."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"A person suffering from thirst due to illness began in spring. After taking medicine throughout the summer, they regained strength and the thirst gradually improved. However, urination remained frequent, exceeding twenty times a day and night, with each time amounting to three or four liters, and at its worst still not reducing below two liters. Over time, the frequency diminished, but the person gradually consumed rich and fatty foods, becoming increasingly emaciated. Their throat felt constricted, lips and mouth dried out, and they experienced shortness of breath, unable to speak much. They felt heat and irritation in the heart, with aching legs, and their appetite multiplied, hence the lack of energy. One should know that this illness arises from excessive heat in a deficient state. Treatment: Long-term consumption of herbal juice can eliminate heat, while cow's milk and apricot cheese are good for replenishing, making this method most beneficial. Internal consumption-related illness is caused by heat. Urination exceeding drinking causes extreme depletion and shortness of breath. Internal consumption refers to the transformation of food into urine without triggering thirst. In observing over ten years, the Governor of Zizhou, Li Wenbo, had long taken white stone as medicine. Suddenly, he experienced a strong desire for intercourse, and after a month, he gradually developed thirst. After several days, urination became excessive, reaching a hundred times a day. Despite various treatments, his condition worsened gradually; his body weakened to the point where he could not stand or stop, his spirits became disoriented, and his mouth and tongue dried out, leading to his demise.

In such cases, it is advisable to take pig kidney and jicama soup to resolve the kidney stone heat; one should also take white duck soup. Many people indulge recklessly during their youth. At the height of their strength, they do not exercise caution or care, pursuing desires and pleasures to extremes; as they age slightly, their kidney energy becomes depleted, leading to the proliferation of various ailments. Additionally, young individuals who fear they cannot engage in sexual activity often take stone powders.

There may be thirst accompanied by diarrhea, even up to a stone daily, or thirst without diarrhea, or diarrhea without thirst. Everything consumed seems to turn into urine, all of which results from excess in sexual conduct. For ordinary people, excessive thirst in summer is attributed to the heart's governance.

This is a sign of someone in good health, referred to as thirst for fluids. However, if one urinates frequently without drinking water, it indicates strong kidney function. The texts say: strong kidneys lead to urination. Thirst without the desire to drink water occurs in such cases. Therefore, those consuming stones will find urination frequent, as the nature of stones returns to the kidneys. When the kidneys are supported by stones, they can effectively metabolize fluids, hence the frequent urination; but when urination is excessive, the five organs do not receive adequate nourishment, leading to their decline and various illnesses. Zhang Zhongjing states: heat congestion in the middle jiao results in hardness, while heat congestion in the lower jiao leads to bloody urination. Moreover, heat congestion can cause dysuria and blockage, which should not excessively irritate frequent urination. If there is internal heat, the person will be thirsty; removing the heat will stop the thirst. Concurrent deficiency needs heat removal and replenishment to achieve recovery. For anyone suffering from thirst for fluids for over a hundred days, cauterization or needling should not be done. Such treatments may cause pus from sores to not cease, leading to abscesses and eventually emaciation and death. Care must also be taken to avoid accidental harm, even small needle wounds.

One must strictly avoid giving Baihu Decoction to those with Taiyang syndrome who have no sweat and are thirsty; for Yangming syndrome with much sweating and thirst, one should not give Wuling Powder. One asks: Then for Taiyang disease with thirst, can it ever be treated with Baihu? The reply: For Taiyang syndrome, after sweating, if the pulse is surging and there is thirst, then it can be given. One asks: For Yangming disease with thirst, can it ever be treated with Wuling? The reply: For Yangming syndrome with difficulty in urination, little sweating, floating pulse, and thirst, then it can be given. These are all subtle methods of Zhongjing. In general, thirst must not be treated with water unless it is a severe thirst. If it is slight thirst with a dry throat, one should sip to moisten it, ensuring the stomach is balanced. If there is severe thirst with great agitation, and a person can drink a dou, then give them five sheng. If nothing is administered, the dryness will prevent sweating, leading to coughing and even death. Common people, seeing that drinking water alleviates slight thirst, often drink excessively, resulting in fullness and cough leading to death; this is very common. One should use Wuling Powder or Xianxiong Pill to treat this. If the Yang poison is greatly intense, causing extreme thirst, then Heinu Pill is the main treatment.

Upper Xiaoke indicates disease in the upper Jiao, also known as diaphragm disease; it involves excessive thirst, significant water intake, and diminished food consumption, with normal bowel movements and possibly clear, copious urination, indicating dryness in the upper Jiao. Treatment should focus on moistening and relieving dryness. Middle Xiaoke pertains to the stomach, characterized by thirst with excessive food and drink intake, and yellow urine. The classics state: 'Heat consumes the grains,' indicating heat in the middle, thus it is necessary to purge. When one feels disinterested in food and drink, recovery occurs. Kidney Xiaoke originates in the lower Jiao, initially presenting as a condition known as “gao lin” (mucous urination), where the output resembles oil. As the disease progresses, it leads to a dark complexion, emaciation, and oily, turbid urine. The treatment should focus on nourishing the blood to clarify, separating the clear from the turbid for self-healing. The method states: dryness above leads to thirst; pungent and sweet flavors promote lung moistening, therefore, honey-boiled ginger soup can be administered generously, to sip occasionally. The method emphasizes: in heart and lung diseases, do not despise frequent small amounts of drink. The Inner Canon says: 'For supplementing the upper Jiao, treatment should be gentle.' It also notes: 'Use pungent substances to moisten.' Opening the pores facilitates the circulation of fluids, allowing lung qi to descend, hence reducing heat and dryness, ultimately quenching thirst. Furthermore, it is noted: 'The two Yangs are bound and create the condition of Xiaoke.' Wang’s commentary states: 'The two Yangs bind due to heat in the stomach and large intestine.' When the intestines and stomach harbor heat, they can effectively process water and grains. Therefore, a sweet and pungent formula to remove heat may be used: one pound of Huanglian powder, one pound each of fresh Rehmannia glutinosa juice, fresh white lotus root juice, and cow’s milk, simmered into a paste; the Huanglian powder can be formed into pills the size of a wutong seed."},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"Take thirty pills each time, wash them down with a sip of warm water, and administer daily.

In cases of gastric congestion with heat and fullness, where one feels hungry but does not want to eat, or if the heat has turned into consumption leading to good appetite but weight loss, or due to severe dryness and heat causing thirst, with frequent urination, the excessive heat from the heart and dryness of the three burners impair the smooth flow of fluids, resulting in the body being deprived of moisture, leading to emaciation and a dry, heat-laden thirst. Even with much drinking, the fluids fail to penetrate the stomach and intestines, which cannot satisfy thirst, causing excessive urination. The common misunderstanding that this results from a deficiency and cold in the lower burner has misled many. If cold from the heart affects the lungs, it leads to lung depletion, with reduced drinking and increased urination. One should nourish the lungs and calm the heart; if dead, it can still be treated, indicating that the heart and lungs are in conflict. If heat from the heart affects the lungs, it is termed gastric consumption, whereby heart and gastric heat can lead to thirst through prolonged effects, treated by Mai Men Dong drink.

The Inner Canon mentions that the human body has six positions from head to feet. Now I say there are also six positions in the chest and abdomen of a person, from the lungs to the kidneys. Humans are connected with heaven and earth, and the five elements, forged in the same crucible; knowing one leads to understanding the other. Therefore, the celestial energies are categorized as metal and fire, while the terrestrial energies are categorized as earth and water. The vital energies of humans are defined as wind and fire. Thus, when metal and fire combine, they create heat and clarity; when water and earth combine, they create humidity and coldness; when wind and fire combine, they create warmth and intensity. This is also true within the human chest and abdomen. The lungs, being the highest, represent metal and govern dryness and clarity; the heart, next, represents fire and governs heat; the liver follows, representing wind and wood, which govern warmth; the gallbladder follows as well, representing fire and governing extreme heat; the spleen, following this, represents earth and humidity, governing coolness; and the kidneys, lastly positioned, correspond to the Yellow Springs and govern cold water. Therefore, the heart and lungs symbolize heaven, the spleen and kidneys symbolize earth, while the liver and gallbladder symbolize humanity. Those who do not understand this cannot be engaged in discussions about human ailments. Earth is the foundation of all things, and water is the essence of all things. When water and earth combine in virtue, they dwell in the yin, residing below as the essence of the earth; all things take root in the earth, hence water and earth produce humidity and cold. If the yang becomes excessively dry and hot, then the energy of the earth fails to establish itself, and the roots of all things wither, leaving branches and leaves dry.

The core comprises the spleen, stomach, and kidneys. When food enters the stomach, the spleen transforms it into qi and flavor, nourishing the five organ systems and all joints. Therefore, sour nourishes the liver to strengthen tendons, bitter nourishes the heart to enhance blood vessels, sweet nourishes the spleen for muscles, spicy nourishes the lungs for skin and hair, and salty nourishes the kidneys for bone marrow. The five qi operate similarly: clear qi nourishes the lungs, hot qi nourishes the heart, warm qi nourishes the liver, damp qi nourishes the spleen, and cold qi nourishes the kidneys. When any of these five flavors or five qi are excessive, illness occurs; if deficient, illness also arises; only in balance can there be stability. Thus, the theory of the six stages and organs states: the five flavors are ingested and stored in the intestines and stomach. Each flavor is stored to nurture the qi of the five organs; when qi is harmonious, it generates life, and bodily fluids are formed, allowing the spirit to arise. This is its principle. Furthermore, the discussion of the Taiyin and Yangming states: why do the limbs become ineffective when the spleen is ill? Qibo replied: The limbs draw their qi from the stomach, yet cannot reach the channels. This is necessarily because they rely on the spleen and kidneys. Now, if the spleen is ill and unable to move the fluids from the stomach, it cannot derive qi from food and water. The spleen weakens daily, the channels are obstructed, and the muscles, bones, and tissues lack the qi for vitality, hence they become ineffective. The Emperor asked: Why does the spleen not govern the seasons? Qibo replied: The spleen corresponds to the earth, governing the center, and regularly interacts with the four seasons to nourish the five organs, each for eighteen days; it cannot exclusively govern at any one season. The spleen constantly relies on the essence of the stomach’s earth."},{"anchor":"trans-21p","marker":"21p","type":"translation","text":"The earth is the source of all things and follows the principles of heaven and earth; therefore, from top to bottom, one cannot solely dominate time.

The foot Yangming, as the exterior and the sea of the five organs and six bowels, also assists in the flow of Qi in the three Yang. The internal organs each draw in Qi through their channels to benefit Yangming, hence the stomach governs the flow of its fluids. The limbs do not draw from food and water, and as the Qi declines daily, the Yin pathways become obstructed, and the sinews, bones, and muscles lack Qi to grow, leading to their inactivity. Inactivity refers to being unable to perform their functions. From this, we see that the five organs and six bowels, as well as the limbs and bones, all rely on the spleen and stomach to circulate their fluids and mutually moisten and nourish each other. Later physicians, wishing to use drying and heating agents to nourish the spleen and stomach and invigorate the earth’s Qi, are misguided, aren't they? Moreover, for those suffering from thirst and hunger, their inherent damp and cold Yin Qi is already weak; adding excessive drying heat with medicinal herbs further depletes the Qi of the spleen and stomach. Some do not distinguish between the five organs’ and six bowels’ Qi in terms of deficiency and excess, and broadly classify heat as excess and cold as deficiency.

If the stomach is cold and deficient, it indicates a significant presence of cold yin fluids in the stomach and a frail yang fire, not that the earth element of the stomach is fundamentally weak. Therefore, one should warm and tonify the yang fire in the stomach to reduce the excessive cold yin fluids. Similarly, if the stomach is hot and in excess, it indicates a strong yang fire in the stomach and a deficiency of yin fluids, thus cold herbs should be used to drain the excess fire in the stomach while nourishing the deficient fluids. These methods address the excess and deficiency of yin and yang within the stomach, rather than the fundamental dampness of the stomach. The same applies to other organs. To address the dampness of the spleen and stomach, to moisten the dampness is to tonify it, and to dry the dampness is to drain it, as the earth element is inherently damp. In all organs and systems, it is not necessary for the kidney water to solely manage cold or for the heart fire to solely manage heat; one must understand that each organ harmonizes its respective energies. I often say that the principle of the five elements is that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin; solitary yin does not thrive, and solitary yang cannot prevail. All things contain their counterparts, and the five elements support one another, which is called harmony; their interactions of overcoming and weakening represent decline and growth; chaos and disarray lead to afflictions. Therefore, when water is scarce and fire abundant, it signifies a strong yang and a weak yin, leading to heat diseases; conversely, when water is abundant and fire scarce, it signifies a strong yin and a weak yang, leading to cold diseases.

Moreover, those with diabetes initially incur such conditions due to improper diet and medication, causing dryness and stagnation in the intestines and stomach, hindering the smooth distribution of qi and fluids, which may lead to mental disturbance, excessive imbalance, or result from major illnesses that diminish yin energy, weakening the blood and leading to excessive yang heat and dryness. Hence, the three types of diabetes arise from a long-standing craving for salty foods, excessive intake of fried and roasted items, and heavy drinking. Some young people also consume pills made from metals and stones, which can accumulate and create internal heat, leading to a deficiency in the lower body. The blood and qi cannot regulate this heat; hence, the stomach becomes excessively dry, resulting in thirst and urging to drink. If one drinks a lot and urinates frequently, it is called \"water diabetes\" (Xiao Ke); if one eats a lot but remains constantly hungry, with frequent urination and gradual weight loss, it is termed \"middle diabetes\" (Xiao Zhong); if one is thirsty and drinks continuously, with thin legs and oily urine, it is referred to as \"kidney diabetes\" (Shen Xiao).

It is also said that water is the foundation of all things and precedes the five elements, hence kidney water is the source of human vitality and should not be allowed to weaken. If the root is not firm, the branches and leaves will not flourish; if the vital essence is not solid, the body will not thrive. In cases of thirst, the lower kidney water is extremely cold. If cold drugs are taken further, the vital essence will turnEmpty, and the kidney water will weaken, leading to an exacerbation of the upper heart fire, making it difficult to treat. The correct approach is to use warming medicines to nourish the vital essence. If the lower kidney water becomes strong enough to subdue the upper heart fire, then naturally thirst will cease, urination will return to normal, and the condition will improve. Such statements contradict those of Zhong Jing and are what is referred to as clever words that seem plausible but violate the actual principles. This is not merely a misunderstanding of today; it has been a long-standing error. Additionally, in Jiang's \"Pharmaceutical Evidence\" discussing the pathology of thirst and kidney diseases, it is stated: \"The three burners and five organs are all suffer from hyperactivity, yet only the bladder is cold like ice.\" It further states: \"The lower back kidney is increasingly cold.\" It reiterates that the bladder and kidney are as cold as a spring. Initially, it describes the three burners and five organs as all having a hyperactive state, yet the bladder alone is cold like ice.

Moreover, their statements do not correspond, and their errors are minor; but regarding the differences between cold and heat, using opposing treatments is the greatest mistake of all.

They assert that when the water essence is abundant, it can control fire, but if it is deficient, it cannot control fire. Hence, when yang is abundant and yin is deficient, it causes dryness and heats the liquids, resulting in scanty urination; while when yin is abundant and yang is deficient, it cannot control water, leading to frequent urination. Yet, those who are thirsty and have frequent urination do not realize this. Why is that? It is because excessive dryness and heat cause the Sān Jiāo (Triple Burner) and the intestines and stomach to become affected, leading to blockages that prevent water and liquid from seeping out and nourishing the hundred bones. Therefore, outside the intestines and stomach, the excessive dryness and heat, even with much intake, ultimately cannot moisten the exterior, resulting in unceasing thirst. Those with frequent urination, due to excessive intake, cannot disperse liquid outside of the intestines and stomach, hence they urinate frequently. Thus, in the classic \"Yuán Bìng Shì,\" it states: the sweat pores of the skin refer to the openings that release sweat; the gas gates refer to the portals that release qi; the channels refer to the paths and patterns of qi and liquid; the ghost gates refer to the entrance to the netherworld; the original hall refers to the abode of the essence.

Therefore, without entry and exit, there can be no growth, maturation, aging; without ascending and descending, there can be no transformation and storage. It is understood that entry and exit, ascending and descending, exist in all things. Hence, the human faculties of sight, hearing, smell, taste, body, mind, and consciousness, which can be utilized, function due to the unobstructed flow of these movements; if blocked, they cannot function. If the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear, the nose cannot detect fragrance, the tongue cannot taste, the muscles weaken, bones ache, nails recede, teeth decay, hair falls out, skin loses sensation, and the intestines and stomach cannot excrete fluids, all result from a stagnation of heat, an obstruction of the vital center, preventing fluids and blood pathways from ascending, descending, and flowing. Each condition varies in severity, producing different ailments. If the ailment is superficial, it results in stagnation; the pores become tightly closed, preventing the yang energy from dispersing, leading to dryness without sweat and inability for Qi and fluids to emerge. The unlearned do not recognize this, thus observing frequent thirst and urination, mistakenly attributing it to cold in the lower parts. Little do they realize that heat and stagnation in the intestines and stomach cause this. I present this to illustrate that thirst is essentially due to stagnation and blockage of the pathways of excretion in the intestines and stomach: although water enters the intestines and stomach, it cannot be released outward, resulting in frequent urination and subsequent thirst.

Concerning liver blockage and thirst, it is noted that patients with liver blockage are easily startled while sleeping, have excessive thirst, and urinate frequently. As for thirst due to spleen heat, it is stated that when the spleen's Qi is hot, the stomach dries out and thirst arises, leading to muscle weakness and potential muscle wasting. Regarding thirst from kidney heat, it is noted that kidney heat conditions first exhibit pain and soreness in the lower back, followed by severe thirst and frequent drinking, along with overall body heat.

If kidney water is deficient and yin is weak, this results in real yang heat of heart fire, which is described as yang being strong while yin is weak, thus both upper and lower regions are full of heat. Therefore, the Treatise on Stagnation of Qi states: when kidney qi is weak, yang qi prevails. The Manifestation of the Five Qi Theory states: the kidney despises dryness, for from dryness, the kidney becomes depleted and the water dries up. The Discussion on Organ Qi states: the kidney suffers from dryness, and one should urgently consume warm and moistening foods.

If kidney water is already unable to contend with heart fire, leading to heat both above and below, how can one use warm herbs to nourish kidney water in the hope of overcoming heart fire?

The Essentials of Pulsology states: when the pulse entails coalescing into exhaustion, one can eat yet remain thin.

Although it is said that on the first day it is in the skin, on the second day in the flesh, on the third day in the muscles, on the fourth day in the chest, on the fifth day in the abdomen, and on the sixth day entering the stomach, those that transmit through the meridians also manifest with symptoms. The Taiyang primarily governs Qi and is the first to be affected by the pathogen. On the first or second day, if there is headache and rigidity of the waist and spine, this is indicative. When Taiyang transmits to Yangming, on the second or third day there will be fever, eye pain, and nasal dryness, making it difficult to lie down. When Yangming transmits to Shaoyang, on the third or fourth day there will be pain in the chest and ribs, and deafness in the ears. These three Yang meridians are affected by disease; the pathogen is still on the surface and has not yet caused heat, hence there is no thirst. By the fourth or fifth day, as Shaoyang transmits to Taiyin, the pathogenic influence gradually enters the interior, and cold evil begins to transform into heat. At this time, the body fluids are depleted, leading to abdominal fullness and throat dryness. By the fifth or sixth day, as Taiyin transmits to Shaoyin, the internal heat becomes progressively deeper. At this time, the body fluids are attacked by the heat, gradually consumed and dried up, resulting in dry mouth, dry tongue, and thirst. By the sixth or seventh day, the Shaoyin pathogen transmits to Jueyin, and the illness in Jueyin is characterized by excessive thirst, indicating that the internal heat has reached its limit. The so-called excessive thirst means that there is an abundance of drinking water but little urination, signifying that the heat can consume the water."},{"anchor":"trans-36p","marker":"36p","type":"translation","text":"Therefore, when the disease of typhoid reaches six or seven days and the patient feels thirsty and wants to drink water, this is a sign of the body’s desire to recover, as the transmission of the pathogen has progressed. Thus, it is said in the diagnosis of Jueyin disease: if the patient is thirsty and wants to drink water, a little should be given to help recovery. When the evil qi first enters the body, the heat is still dispersed and has not yet consolidated into real heat; it pervades and harms the stomach, consuming bodily fluids and resulting in thirst. Although the patient is thirsty and wishes to drink, one should not give them too much. If too much water is consumed, the heat cannot be dispelled, leading to further complications. The classic states: whenever one suffers from seasonal illnesses, if thirsty by the fifth or sixth day, do not give them a lot to drink. Why? Because the heat in the abdomen is still slight and cannot be dispelled, doing so might exacerbate the condition. If there is great thirst and a strong desire for water, one should still treat according to the symptoms, but provide only what is insufficient; do not overindulge. It is said that one can drink a dou (10 liters) or five sheng (around 1.5 liters); again, if thirsty and wanting water, a little should be offered, and methods should be used to alleviate the situation. For thirsting patients, Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) is recommended. If the thirst is extreme and they wish to drink several sheng, Baihu Decoction with ginseng is the principal remedy, all aiming to moisten dryness and generate bodily fluids. In general, if a patient is capable of drinking, this indicates a desire for recovery; however, those who do not understand the illness mistakenly believe that drinking will bring healing. For those with a slight thirst, when forcefully given water, it can lead to significant disasters that cannot be remedied. Symptoms such as palpitations, chest fullness, difficulty breathing, coughs, choking, dry retching, abdominal distension, and frequent diarrhea or difficulty urinating are all due to excessive drinking harming the body.

Therefore, the utility of Fire is such that when wood is burned, it is transformed into charcoal; when earth is burned, it is transformed into dragon's liver; when metal is refined, it is transformed into juice; when stone is calcined, it is transformed into ash; when water is boiled, it is transformed into broth; when the sea is distilled, it is transformed into salt; when mercury is dried, it turns into powder; when tin is smelted, it is transformed into vermilion. Thus, the marsh's runoff dries under the blazing sun; the water in the cauldron evaporates under strong fire. The Five Organs: the heart represents the sovereign Fire's proper transformation, and the kidneys represent the sovereign Fire's opposing transformation; the Triple Burner represents the ministerial Fire’s proper transformation, and the gallbladder represents the ministerial Fire’s opposing transformation. When balance is achieved, food can be prepared and waste removed; when balance is lost, it burns and scorches the organs, leading to depletion of bodily fluids. Hence, anything that enters water flourishes; anything that enters fire perishes. The fire of the heart within the body dominates the upper part, leading to the elimination of layers; it dominates the middle, affecting the intestines and stomach; it dominates the lower part affecting bodily fluids; and it dominates the exterior affecting the muscles."},{"anchor":"trans-39p","marker":"39p","type":"translation","text":"If excessive heat goes unchecked upwards, it affects the lungs; if it goes unchecked in the middle, it affects the spleen; if it goes unchecked downwards, it affects the liver and kidneys; if it goes unchecked externally, it affects the sinews and bones.

Therefore, the \"Suwen\" mentions various types of consumption: consuming deficiency, middle consumption, thirst consumption, wind consumption, phlegm consumption, and lung consumption. The symptoms of consumption differ, but they all point to a common underlying fire. Thus, consuming deficiency is a general term for various consumptions; middle consumption refers to the state of being excessively hungry; thirst consumption refers to the state of being excessively thirsty. However, wind consumption, phlegm consumption, and lung consumption should not be confused. Wind consumption is a disease of the two Yangs. The two Yangs refer to the Yangming, which is the stomach and large intestine. If the heart is affected, the blood does not flow, leading to women being unable to have their monthly cycle; if the spleen is affected, flavors do not transform, causing men to have low vitality, both unable to engage in matters of hidden fulfillment. When heat is trapped internally and persists, it stirs up wind that depletes the intestines and stomach, resulting in dry mouth. Even when drinking water, one cannot swallow; this is the rejection of wind-heat at the entrance of the stomach. The mouth is the upper source of disease, hence the illness manifests as such. Moreover, it is stated that the binding of the two Yangs is called consumption, and this consumption refers to the depletion of the intestines and stomach.

Therefore, when heat from the heart moves to the lungs and over time transforms, it becomes an internal heat of the diaphragm. In cases of excessive thirst, even when there is significant drinking, this is due to the lung's metal element being affected by the heart's fire evil; however, it is still only \"Ge Xiao,\" not reaching the lungs themselves. Hence, even drinking large amounts of water cannot quench the thirst. The symptoms include excessive drinking and frequent urination, or in some cases, not urinating frequently and developing edema, all of which stem from this condition. This is the \"Xiao\" related to the diaphragm. \"Lung Xiao,\" on the other hand, occurs when cold from the heart affects the lungs, which govern air. The classics say: food and drink enter the stomach, overflowing with vital essence, and are then transferred to the spleen; the spleen's essence returns to the lungs, connecting and regulating the water pathways, which then disperse to the bladder. The essential fluids spread throughout the four directions, with the five channels operating harmoniously to maintain normalcy. The \"Lingshu\" also mentions: the upper burner is like mist, the middle burner like bubbling, and the lower burner like a drain."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"Now the heart is like fire, initially affected by Yang pathogens. The Yang fire becomes stagnant internally, spreading the heat within. The lungs, associated with metal, are restrained, and both fire and cold pathogens invade them. Externally, the lungs are weakened by cold, while internally they are dried out by fire. The extreme heat leads to a return of water flow, causing the skin to feel dry and tense, resulting in scorching heat in urination and frequent need to relieve oneself. Thus, it is said that drinking leads to urination and death. If the diaphragm is not assailed by cold, the Yang energy can disperse outward, making treatment possible. However, if the lungs are affected by cold, the Yang energy collapses internally, and treatment is unfeasible. This condition pertains to the consumption affecting the lungs. If the Spleen Wind transmits to the kidneys, it is called hernia or masses. The lower abdomen becomes resentfully hot and painful, leading to the discharge of white fluid, known as \"gu\". Wang Taifu stated: the consumption consumes fat and flesh like worms eroding away, gradually reducing them; this consumption refers to the depletion of the essence. Therefore, later scholars discuss the three burnings referring to kidney consumption, which might still be treatable, or else the person will develop complications, and without intervention, death is inevitable. This consumption directly affects the kidneys. Consumption inevitably leads to thirst, which has three types: thirst for sweetness, thirst for stones, and thirst from dryness of fire. Those with much fat lead to internal heat; sweet foods lead to fullness, causing the Qi to overflow, converting to excessive thirst. The classics also say: rich tastes generate heat. The \"Lingshu\" further states: salty flavor moves the blood; consuming it in abundance leads to thirst. When salt enters the stomach, the Qi ascends through the middle jiao, directing to the lungs, where the blood Qi flows with it.

When it encounters heat, it inevitably injures the spleen. This is the thirst brought about by stone medicine. Yangming governs the heavens, corresponding with the four energies, leading to dryness in the throat and a craving for drinks. This occurs because the heart fire is restrained by cold water. Shaoyang governs the heavens, corresponding with the three energies; when summer heat arrives, people suffer from thirst. Taiyang governs the heavens, and when it becomes severe, there is excessive thirst and desire to drink, resulting from the flow of water obstructing fire, which causes the fiery energy to be constrained. Upon recovery from Shaoyin, there is thirst and a desire to drink, while recovery from Shaoyang leads to a throat that feels scorched and dry, prompting a craving for drinks, and a change in color to yellowish-red. After suffering from cold for five days, if afflicted by Shaoyin, one experiences dryness of the mouth, a dry tongue, and thirst. Those with kidney heat disease experience severe thirst and frequent drinking. All of these are instances of dryness and heat leading to thirst. Thus, individuals who consume rich foods tend to experience thirst from rich and sweet foods, as well as from stone medicines; those engaged in strenuous activities often experience thirst from dryness and heat. Although these two types differ, they are fundamentally the same. Therefore, when fire is concentrated above, there is strong thirst; when it is in the middle, it enhances digestion and causes hunger; when it is both in the upper and middle sections, there is the tendency for thirst, increased drinking, and frequent urination; when it is primarily in the middle and lower sections, there is no thirst but clear urination; and when it is spread throughout the upper, middle, and lower sections, there is increased drinking and frequent urination.

The Eight Flavor Pill treats thirst, yet it does not produce water and instead promotes fire. Such individuals are fundamentally ignorant of the texts, carelessly quoting the annotations of Wang Taifu, increasing the source of fire to extinguish the yin shadow, and bolstering the water element to control the yang light. However, they only enhance the heart's yang, allowing cold and heat to flow freely, and strengthen the kidney's yin—heat may work, but do they understand that Wang Taifu's intention was to balance cold and heat? The kidneys inherently dislike dryness; can fire be added to them? Nowadays, Liu Hejian personally formulates the Shenqiong Pill, incorporating bitter Huangqin to enter the heart, using Qianqiu and Dahuang to drive heat downward, and Shiwei to draw it into the kidney pathway. This formula regards Qianqiu and Shiwei as the monarch, with Dahuang and Huangqin as ministers, and Chuanxiong, Lian, and Bohe as envoys, aiming to separate what is above from what is below—this embodies the secret meaning of the Huang Court. Additionally, by using Ren Shen, Bai Zhu Decoction, Xiaopi Pill, Da Ren Shen Powder, Biyu, and Jisus Powder in various methods to adjust, it thus effectively treats thirst. In the past, there was a person with great thirst who drank several liters daily. A master used a basin of natural ginger juice, placed it in a sealed room with a container, and had the person enter, then locked the door. When the patient felt extreme thirst, they had no choice but to drink the juice entirely, and their thirst diminished. This illustrates the intent of the \"Inner Canon\" in moistening."},{"anchor":"trans-44p","marker":"44p","type":"translation","text":"In the \"Inner Classic,\" the treatment for thirst involves using orchids to eliminate stagnant qi, which is also a mild remedy.

Hence, the governor of Ba County claimed that Sanhuang Pills could treat thirst. In my own experience, after several years without improvement, I removed (stone salt) and nitrate, then added one pound of Coptis to create a large potion, brewing it vigorously for five to seven boils, allowing it to cool, and drinking it in hundreds of sips over several days. Alternately, I used Gui Ling Gan Lu Powder, Bai Hu Decoction, fresh lotus stem juice, light bamboo juice, and raw Rehmannia juice in a staggered manner, producing a large quantity to replace drinking water, and soon achieved recovery. Therefore, for the symptom of thirst, with balanced treatment without excessive purging, it results in slight moisture. A slight moistening ultimately cannot quell the heat rising; if purging is conducted without balance, it leads to continual drinking and dissipation, never truly nourishing the dryness of the diaphragm.

Those who are strong often have anger; when anger arises, Qi reverses upward, accumulating in the chest, and the blood and Qi flow back to the skin, filling the muscles, causing the pulse to stagnate, thus transforming into heat. This heat then consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. It also states that if all five organs are soft and weak, they are predisposed to consumption. Softness and weakness must coexist with strength; strength often leads to anger, and softness easily gets injured. From this, I realized that those with reversed Qi are not only suffering from consumption. If there is cold on the outside, it may lead to boils, shortness of breath, mania, obstruction in the chest, lung consumption, or water retention; if heat invades the organs, it can cause shock, nosebleeds, consumption of the diaphragm, frailty, and abdominal death; if it affects the bowels, it may lead to urinary retention, blood in urine, mouth ulcers, abdominal tension, food issues, throat obstruction, nasal congestion, nosebleeds, or blindness.

The Hand Yangming (large intestine) governs fluid ailments; when dampness (thirst) occurs, the eyes turn yellow and the mouth becomes dry, indicating insufficient fluids. The Foot Yangming (stomach) governs blood; when heat arises, it causes a thirst for food and a craving for snacks, indicative of blood deficiency due to latent fire. Convergence signifies insufficient bodily fluids that are stagnant and not nourishing, leading to conditions of dryness and heat. This arises from consuming excessively sweet and rich food, causing qi to overflow upward and transform into thirst; such conditions are treated with medicinal herbs like orchid to eliminate stale qi. One must avoid sticky, rich, fragrant food and mineral medicines, as their essence is harsh and can exacerbate dryness and heat. A speaker from Yue states: \"When evils reside in the six yang organs, the Yang pulse becomes disharmonious; if the Yang pulse is disharmonious, qi will accumulate, leading to an excess of Yang, and if Yang is too excessive, Yin energy cannot nourish, resulting in the thinning and depletion of skin and muscles.\" The Classics say: \"In treating consumption, fatigue, partial paralysis, atrophy, fullness of qi, and rebellious movement in the body, the wealthy who indulge in rich foods suffer these ailments.\" Qibo states: \"When the pulse is full, long-lasting illnesses can be treated; when the pulse is thin and small, lasting illnesses are difficult to treat.\" The conditions are then classified into three types of thirst.

The sores are very painful but do not rupture, sometimes with blood-like water. The classic states: \"If it has a form but no pain, it belongs to the Yang category.\" Attack the Yang urgently, while avoiding the Yin; treatment should focus on the lower regions. When vital energy is strong, there is life; when it is lost, there is death. What is the cause of the fullness in the abdomen for those who have consumed? It is treating cold with heat; even the practitioners cannot abandon established methods in favor of new ones. However, organs have varying distances: the heart and lungs are close, hence should be administered in smaller amounts, while the kidney and liver are farther apart and should receive larger doses, each appropriately considering their conditions. Whether one overdoses or underdoses leads to a situation lacking errors in judgment. For high and middle consumption, if treated too abruptly, the disease may pass quickly, leading to lasting abdominal fullness, which precisely indicates the upper heat has not been resolved while the middle cold has resurfaced.

Middle Xiao is referred to as \"xiao zhong.\" Xiao zhong means thirst with increased eating and drinking; or drinking alone without thirst. Lower Xiao is referred to as \"shen xiao.\" Shen xiao means drinking once leads to urination twice, with urine resembling greasy oil. This is a transformation from ge xiao or xiao zhong. Wang’s commentary states: “Lung energy is exhausted and cannot retain.” The lungs store energy, and when they are healthy, they can manage and gather fluids. The refined essence of these fluids nourishes tendons, bones, and blood vessels, while the remainder is expelled as urine. When the lungs are diseased, they cannot manage the fluids, and the refined essence is also lost through urine, leading to excessive urination that resembles greasy oil. Without sufficient fluids to nourish tendons, bones, and blood vessels, diseases manifest gradually, causing thinness and dryness. However, lung diseases originate from kidney deficiency. When the kidneys are deficient, the heart becomes fearful; excessive actions harm the lungs, leading coldness to invade, and then lung disease develops. Thus, Zhong Jing treated thirst with an increased volume of urination using Shenqi Pills to replenish the kidneys and assist the lungs; hence, later generations termed it \"shen xiao\" and \"lower xiao.\""},{"anchor":"trans-59p","marker":"59p","type":"translation","text":"Some say: The scriptures state that when lung consumption leads to death and cannot be treated, why does Zhong Jing use Shen Qi Wan to address it?

Thus, Zhong Jing's Shen Qi Wan is used for conditions where one drinks a斗 (a unit of measure) of water and also urinates a斗 of fluid. If the urine exceeds the intake, it is also beyond assistance. Irregularity in diet and exhaustion weaken the spleen and stomach, leading to illnesses of blood, which primarily cause the fluids in the mouth to fail to circulate, resulting in dryness of the mouth and throat. The patient mistakenly believes they are thirsty, leading the physician to use Wu Ling San to treat it, which instead exacerbates thirst and dryness, resulting in serious depletion of fluids and risk of death. The scriptures say: \"When there is deficiency, one must nourish its mother.\" Therefore, one should nourish the heart and small intestine. This is fundamental support for the spleen and stomach, using sweet and warm medicines as the main treatment, bitter cold as the means, and sour as the assisting ministers. When the heart is deficient, one should quickly consume sour substances to gather it; if heart fire is strong, the lung metal suffers from pathogenic influences, and when metal is deficient, it should be nourished with sour substances; then add sweet and warm, and sweet and cold agents, to drain the excess heart fire from the spleen and stomach.

There is also a condition of dryness and blockage, as the lungs and large intestine are interrelated. For thirst due to Qi deficiency, it occurs from external pathogens invading inward, or from consuming excessively dry food, causing heat to deplete fluids. Such individuals prefer drinking cold water; they should be given cold and cooling diuretics to clear the heat. Once the heat dissipates, Yin is restored and thirst will subside. For thirst due to blood deficiency, it is caused by internal injuries or overwork, leading to depletion of spirit and a failure of stomach Qi to rise. This can occur after illness when the stomach is weak and fluids are depleted, or from residual heat in the lungs, resulting in a dry mouth and thirst. Such individuals prefer hot soup; they should be given warming and nourishing agents to replenish Yin. Once Yin is restored, dryness will lessen and thirst will cease.

To treat thirst, initially nourish the lungs and descend the heart, then for a long time nourish the kidneys and strengthen the spleen. The root cause lies in the kidneys, while the symptoms are in the lungs. When the kidneys are warm, qi rises and the lungs are moistened; when the kidneys are cold, qi does not rise and the lungs dry out. Therefore, the Kidney Qi Pill is an excellent remedy for thirst.

The reverse adjustment theory says that heat from the heart transforms and transmits to the lungs, resulting in upper消. This can be treated with Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction) with added ginseng. Middle消 (zhongxiaosh消) is characterized by good appetite but thinness, spontaneous sweating, hard stools, and frequent urination. Shuhe states that a dry mouth and increased thirst, along with excessive eating leading to muscular weakness and the formation of middle消, can be treated with Tiaowei Chengqi Decoction. Lower消 (xiash消) presents with restlessness and thirst, dry and burnt ears, and urination resembling oil. Shuhe indicates that the intense thirst and irritability suggest this is kidney消. It can be treated with Liuwu Wan (Six-Flavor Pill). The ancient methods to treat the three jiaos (sanjiao) are detailed, but I have another perspective. When a person's water and fire are balanced, and their qi and blood are adequately nourished, there should be no消. However, if there is improper nourishment, with water and fire imbalanced, fluids become dried out, leading to a fiery upward blaze. Prolonged boiling leads to digestive exhaustion, and the five organs become dry, resulting in emaciation and fatigue. Therefore, the method to treat消 should not divide into upper, middle, or lower; rather, one should prioritize treating the kidney as urgent. Only the Six-Flavor, Eight-Flavor, and modified Eight-Flavor Pills should be taken according to symptoms, reducing heart fire and nourishing kidney water, thus alleviating thirst. Bai Hu and Chengqi should not be used for treatment. The \"Comprehensive Records\" states that those who can't eat but are thirsty indicate a fullness in the middle that is not transmitted; those who can eat and are thirsty are likely to develop abscesses on the back of the neck. The inability to eat points to a problem with the spleen, which should nourish the surrounding areas and work with the stomach to manage fluids.

However, if one might strongly replenish the yin, there may still be a chance to save it. Someone asks: Why do people who take Rehmannia Decoction remain thirsty and cannot be quenched? The answer is: These practitioners cannot abandon their established methods and try a new approach. The heart and lungs are positioned closely, so a smaller dose is appropriate; conversely, the kidney and liver are farther apart, allowing for a larger dose. For conditions with high or middle level consumption, one may use pills in moderation to treat them. However, if lower consumption is at its peak, with great thirst and dryness, one must increase or adjust the eight-flavor pill's dosage to one sheng, adding one liang of cinnamon, boiling it in six or seven bowls of water, and drinking it iced to indulge. If one sleeps well, their thirst problem will be resolved. The formulation of prescriptions depends on the adaptability of the person. Another inquiry: For lower consumption without water, using the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill can nourish the kidney water of the less yin; why add Aconite and Cinnamon?

When drinking and urinating becomes frequent, it consumes the true yin with dryness and fire, leading to exhaustion. According to the \"Inner Canon,\" there are discussions but no treatments. The \"Golden Chamber\" contains both discussions and treatments. However, compilers have conflated the discussions in \"Treatise on Cold Damage\" concerning the Throat Meridian's thirst, leading later generations to be unable to distinguish appropriateness, which is also unsuitable for application. The transmission of cold damage indicates that when the heat pathogen reaches the Throat Meridian, it is entirely manifested; when heat penetrates deeply, thirst arises and consumption occurs. Once the heat resolves, there is no thirst and no consumption. Is this comparable to conditions arising from accumulated symptoms? I humbly propose a discussion based on the \"Inner Canon.\" The texts say that in treating conditions like consumption, collapse, atrophy, weakness, and rebellious qi in the abdomen, afflictions among the wealthy are due to rich foods, which are the sources of consumption.

The richer the food consumed, the worse the inner heat becomes, leading to the illness of internal consumption. Once this internal consumption manifests, it transmits through various pathways, whether upward or downward, especially in areas of intense heat. Upper consumption occurs when the stomach, heated, affects the lungs, burdening the body. The heart, also heated, transfers this heat to the lungs, resulting in suffering for the metal (lungs). Metal is the source of water that emerges from higher origins. When consumed in the stomach, the essence overflows and rises, the lungs adjust the water pathways downward. Now, when heated, the water from the high source is violently pressured, mixing with externally consumed water, rushing down uncontrollably. Urinating often does not merely fail to eliminate external water, but also exhausts and drains the essence of innate water, leading to significant excess in waste discharge. Therefore, without treatment, one dies. The so-called \"death of yin\" related to the heart and lungs, where death can occur within three days, refers to this. Thus, urinating often—first sign of danger."},{"anchor":"trans-73p","marker":"73p","type":"translation","text":"As for the stomach, its heat is transmitted down through the gate to the kidneys. The kidneys may be depleted by stone medicine, exhausting their essence. When a woman experiences this, yang is strong externally, while yin cannot maintain itself internally. This leads to cloudy urination like sludge; after drinking, urination occurs frequently, indicating kidney depletion. The classics mention that the nature of stone medicine is harsh, and it is said that the wind from the spleen transmits to the kidneys, causing what is known as hernia and distension, with pain in the lower abdomen and the discharge of white fluid, referred to as \"gu.\" This clearly indicates kidney depletion. A physician named He states: Women possess yang; indulgence leads to internal heat and the affliction of \"gu.\" This elaboration on internal heat and the meaning of \"gu\" is quite clear. The Grand Minister Wang said: Depletion consumes the flesh like \"gu\" erodes. This is clearly evident from the term \"depletion,\" which is rather shallow. Indeed, being obsessed with women's beauty results in loss of will, and excessive loss of essence leads to turbid fluids, transforming back into a fire, which is the most perilous condition. The classics state: \"When the ruler's fire descends, yin essence supports it.\" Therefore, if there is an excess of yin essence, it is sufficient to support heart fire, signifying longevity; if yin essence is insufficient, heart fire will descend directly to the kidneys, leading to a decline in yang essence, resulting in premature death. Thus, the kidneys serve as the gate of the stomach; if the gate lacks openness, water cannot be released and leads to swelling. If the gate is not closed, water is unceasingly expelled, resulting in thirst.

The discussion on fire at the beginning is not without its reason. However, applying the principle of purging Qi to treat vigorous fire leads to no effective result for diabetes. Thus, the fire of below diabetes is akin to fire in water; lowering it only intensifies the burn. The fire of middle diabetes is akin to the draining fire of marshes; lowering it only causes more harm. The fire of upper diabetes is like a wildfire; water that falls from heaven can extinguish it. Merely attacking the intestines and stomach is of no benefit, and instead causes harm. The earth's energy rises as clouds, and in turn, the heavens’ energy descends as rain; thus, rain arises from the earth's energy. If the earth’s energy does not rise, can the heavens rain?

Other conditions like diaphragm consumption and food-related issues are also just forms of upper and middle consumption. However, without practical references from the \"Essential Prescription,\" my heart remained unsatisfied. Two years later, I suddenly remembered the \"Inner Canon\" stating: when there is labor and fatigue, the physical energy diminishes, and the energy of grains is not abundant. The upper burner does not function well, the stomach's energy is hot, and this heat disturbs the chest, resulting in internal heat. I realized that the disease in the chest is solely due to the energy of food and grain in the stomach, which circulates and nourishes the chest, allowing for clarity and brightness to manifest in one's own body."},{"anchor":"trans-76p","marker":"76p","type":"translation","text":"If there is fatigue or weariness that harms the fundamental energy and vital essence, then the energy in the chest becomes weak; the digestive energy in the stomach thereby does not thrive. When the digestive energy does not thrive, the injured energy in the chest becomes even harder to recover, and cannot be adequately replenished. Consequently, the digestive energy remains stagnant in the stomach, causing stagnation and heat within. This heat then pervades the chest, mixing with the weakened energy and transforming into internal heat. The balance between the chest and stomach becomes unsettled, making it impossible to avoid thirst and depletion. Understanding this key point clarifies what has been previously misunderstood in the \"Golden Chamber\" text. It states: if the pulse at the wrist is floating and slow, the floating indicates deficiency, and the slow indicates fatigue. Deficiency implies insufficient protective energy, and fatigue means that the nourishing energy is depleted. If the pulse at the foot is floating and rapid, the floating signifies energy, and the rapid indicates that the digestive process is impaired and there is excessive solidity; abundant energy results in quick urination, and quick urination indicates solidity. When solidity and rapidity collide, this signifies thirst. By examining the wrist pulse, one can assess the energy in the chest; by examining the pulse at the foot, one can assess the energy in the stomach. Clearly, there is a pulse to follow and evident signs to observe, yet it is difficult to discern the subtleties. The essence lies in the fact that yin resides within, safeguarding the yang; yang is outside, reinforcing the yin. A floating pulse at the wrist indicates that yin is not properly maintaining itself internally, thus, the yang in the external protective layer is floating and signifies deficiency. A slow pulse at the wrist indicates that yang is not effectively anchored externally, therefore, the yin safeguarding internally is slow and signifies fatigue. Overall, it is the injury of nourishing and protective energies that causes the wrist pulse to be deficient and slow. The nourishing energy pertains to the essence of food and water, while the protective energy pertains to their robust qualities. When both are deficient and slow, the energy from food and water fails to rise and fills the interior with stagnation, which is already evident of a weak diaphragm and stomach heat."},{"anchor":"trans-77p","marker":"77p","type":"translation","text":"In addition to the floating pulse of the Fuyang meridian, when it is floating it represents Qi, which corresponds to the changes described in the \"Inner Canon\" regarding heat Qi scorching the chest; when it is rapid, it indicates the consumption of food and the presence of a large hardness.

This coincides with the presence of hardness in the stomach, where food is consumed but water is not, illustrating that the heat of fire can consume water, while water can quench thirst. When the stomach is hard and dry, it does not absorb water; instead, it is driven by the force of heat, leading to rapid urination, resulting in frequent urination. This depletion exacerbates dryness, thus the hardness and frequency clash, constituting thirst. Directly referencing the \"Inner Canon,\" excessive bitterness, prolonged exposure to heat transforms it, and the spleen's Qi is not moistened, leading to a thickened stomach Qi — this is the source of thirst, both subtle and significant. After the Jin and Tang dynasties, while there were many who were wise and insightful, interpreting the \"Inner Canon,\" each rising figure became notable in their own right, yet none entered the profound teachings of Zhang Zhongjing, as what they obtained from the \"Inner Canon\" was shallow. Had they delved deeper, they could have correlated conditions, compared symptoms, and derived treatments based on pulse and symptomology to clarify established methods, but the remnants of the \"Golden Cabinet\" have been passed down and recited in households."},{"anchor":"trans-78p","marker":"78p","type":"translation","text":"Just as in cases of thirst, it is traditionally said that those with mid-thirst should be treated with purgatives, adhering to this principle without other considerations.

The bladder does not act, but the large intestine does; could this not lead to complications driven by the medication, resulting in issues like fullness and swelling? The \"Comprehensive Record\" states: those who are able to eat but develop boils will inevitably suffer from severe swelling; those who cannot eat will certainly experience abdominal fullness and bloating, all of which are signs of an illness that cannot be treated. Various schools do not focus on the initial stages of the disease but rather on the later stages, employing many treatments like honeysuckle, blue leaves, and herbal pills, as well as combinations for abdominal fullness. What is their intention? The \"Golden Cabinet\" suggests that in instances of slight urinary discomfort, one should early on use only clam as treatment, which is not mentioned in published formulas. Little do they know that softening and firming substances, if not treating deficiency can injure it, while this particular one is benign, effective for diuresis, and truly precious! Jiegao states: for those who can eat but are thirsty, one should use White Tiger Decoctio with ginseng.

A blockage arises from a lack of fluids and blood; when blocked and not moving, it is a disease caused by dryness. The \"Neijing\" states: the heart transfers heat to the lungs, which results in diaphragm dysfunction. Zhang Zihe suggests that diaphragm dysfunction has not yet reached the lungs; when the heart transfers cold to the lungs, this constitutes lung dysfunction. By muddying the text, one misunderstands the \"Neijing.\" How could it be that the heart transfers heat to the lungs, and the lungs pass that heat to the diaphragm, but it has not yet affected the lungs? It is necessary to change the text to state that the heart transfers heat to the diaphragm, which then transmits it to the lungs, thereby avoiding confusion. It must be understood that the heart and lungs both reside above the diaphragm, with the lungs being a delicate organ. Cold and heat can easily enter; however, when cold pathogens enter, they are bound externally, while hot pathogens enter and transmit outward. Both affect the lung tips, but treatment must differentiate them.

It is stated in the texts that thirst can arise from various causes: heart and lung qi stagnation leading to thirst, liver blockage causing thirst, heat obstruction leading to thirst, stomach and large intestine heat causing thirst, spleen blockage resulting in thirst, kidney heat causing thirst, and small intestine heat causing thirst. The more one examines these causes, the more one finds them lacking in clarity regarding consuming thirst, merely citing thirst as a manifestation of dryness and heat depleting fluids, which is indeed puzzling. In the \"Essentials of the Jade Mechanism,\" there is a deep discussion on this, erroneously attributing the cure for consumption to warming remedies for the kidneys; I am unsure what such warming medicines truly entail. Is there any reasoning in the world that a warming remedy could treat consuming thirst? The implication likely lies in the fact that it is not based on the \"Golden Cabinet\" principle of Kidney Qi Pills. Yet Kidney Qi Pills invigorate kidney water and are known as the miraculous remedy for consuming thirst, recognized by later generations. Why then does Bai Zhai further elaborate on this? I am concerned that later scholars might casually come across the discussions of Zi He and Zong Hou, which might confuse and mislead them further, prompting me to restate this point. The condition called \"Dampness\" leads to consuming in the middle, with intense stomach heat and excessive stomach fire, resulting in an increased appetite and thirst. Various schools suggest the use of Major Decoction to Purge for treatment. However, they fail to recognize that the accumulated heat, which has gradually developed, and the inherent fire will not be resolved by aggressive purging.

The formula states: for treating internal heat in the stomach that affects appetite, with slight yellowish red urine and minimal urination, if one loses the desire to eat, it should not be overutilized. I fear that minimal urination leading to loss of appetite indicates that the stomach qi is already depleted. The method of purging medicine is not to be recklessly applied. You harmonize this formula into \"Jiajian Sanyuan Pill,\" combining rhubarb with Scutellaria and Coptis, while not using bitter orange or amomum. The formula also addresses the toxicity and heat caused by mineral medications. By intuition, it must be used with substantial effectiveness, considering whether the condition of dryness is due to the body's genuine qi being consumed by excessive heat. Is there truly anyone of substantial build? Thus, to eliminate the heat from the stomach, what must be done? I believe that prolonged steaming of rhubarb, combined with licorice, can provide a balanced approach to quickening and soothing. When used with ginseng, it can simultaneously attack and tonify, similar to enhancing agricultural production in a prosperous land, enduring initial challenges, thereby hoping for benefits over three years.

The illness of the three types of diabetes is related to the three burners. The upper diabetes, characterized by extreme thirst, leads to constant drinking; this depletes the fluids in the upper burner. It has been said that the disease lies in the lungs, yet it is also due to the heat from the heart and spleen, which can scorch these areas, hence it is also called phlegm diabetes. The middle diabetes pertains to the middle burner, where excessive eating leads to hunger without increasing flesh, resulting in gradual weight loss; this disease is located in the spleen and stomach, also referred to as ingestion diabetes. The lower diabetes concerns the lower burner, where urine is yellow and turbid, sometimes resembling fat or grease, with the face dark and ears scorched, involving gradual weight loss; this ailment is in the kidneys, thus also known as kidney diabetes. The ancients recognized all three types as manifestations of fire disease, yet there are cases of real fire caused by excess heat, and instances of false fire from insufficient true yin. If one treats diabetes without distinguishing between excess and deficiency, errors are inevitable. Understanding the distinctions of yin and yang in diabetes is crucial. For example, excessive thirst is termed \"thirst diabetes,\" excessive hunger is termed \"grain diabetes,\" and turbid urine resembling fat indicates \"kidney diabetes.\""},{"anchor":"trans-85p","marker":"85p","type":"translation","text":"All of this arises mainly because a strong fire leads to a deficiency of yin, which is a sign of the consumption of yang. However, the meaning of yin consumption is not well understood by many. Consumption refers to both dissolution and depletion. Any decline and failure of the yin-yang, blood, or qi is termed consumption, so one cannot entirely explain it in terms of fire. How can this be demonstrated? For instance, the theory of qi collapse states: \"When the heart is influenced by cold in the lungs, it leads to lung consumption; after drinking one or two urinations, death occurs without treatment.\" This is precisely due to the decline of foundational qi, leading to coldness in metal and water; thus, water fails to transform into qi, while all qi transforms into water. Isn't this a manifestation of yin deficiency presenting as a sign of yang? Furthermore, the chapter on pathogenic influences in organs says: \"When the pulses of the five organs are thin and small, it signifies consumption and stagnation.\" Can one consider these thin pulses as signs of excess yang? This clearly illustrates the concept of yin consumption in the \"Inner Classic,\" which is not well comprehended by people. Therefore, when treating the three signs of consumption, one must observe the pulses and the nature of the disease. If one only notes the deficiency of foundational qi and associated signs of false heat, they must swiftly address the root cause to nourish the source of transformation. Merely recognizing the condition as fire and focusing on clearing it will inevitably result in both yin and yang failing."},{"anchor":"trans-86p","marker":"86p","type":"translation","text":"### Discussion on Treatment In terms of treatment methods for bodily fluids, the foremost step is to discern between deficiency and excess. If, upon examining the pulse and symptoms, it is confirmed that genuine fire causes the depletion of fluids, then simply removing the fire will allow fluids to regenerate, stopping the thirst. If the issue arises from insufficient true water, this is entirely a matter of yin deficiency, regardless of whether it pertains to the upper, middle, or lower levels. It is crucial to treat the kidneys, ensuring that the yin energy gradually replenishes and the essence and blood recover, thereby letting the illness heal naturally. If one only focuses on clearing fire, there will be no support for yin to generate, and the deterioration will be increasingly apparent, leading to more distress. Upper consumption leads to excessive thirst, while middle consumption results in excessive hunger. Although it is said that upper consumption pertains to the lungs and middle consumption to the stomach, fundamentally, the fire within the upper and middle burners is merely the stomach fire raging upwards. Therefore, minor distinctions in treatment are necessary. If both burners are indeed affected by excess fire, then White Tiger Decoction is appropriate for both. If there is more thirst than hunger, especially with illness predominantly in the lungs, then Ginseng White Tiger Decoction should be used. If water is deficient in the lower burner and fire is flaming in the upper burner, and there is a need to clear it, then Jade Maiden Decoction or a modified version of One-Yin Decoction should be administered."},{"anchor":"trans-87p","marker":"87p","type":"translation","text":"One says: The thirst in the upper burner is caused by the heart fire injuring the metal. It is advisable to lower the fire and clear the metal using ingredients like orchid leaves, white glossy privet flowers, yellow coptis, and anemarrhena, adding a little asarum to guide the clear qi upward and alleviate thirst. This approach can also be appropriately used. For the symptom of deficiency fire in the middle burner, characterized by being hungry yet thin, the ancient method directly uses formulas like the Stomach Harmonizing and Qi Regulating Decoction and San Huang Wan. However, since there is already good hunger, there should be no stagnation. If there is no stagnation, it is best to clear the fire; it is not suitable to attack the fire. Without symptoms like clumping and obstruction, using these two formulas may not be appropriate. If it is indeed due to stomach fire with no deficiency symptoms, then formulas like San Bu Wan, Yu Quan San, Bai Hu Tang, and Chou Xin Yin can all be considered for use. For the symptom of lower burner deficiency, where the urination is turbid like grease or oil, and there may be additional symptoms of restlessness and buzzing in the ears, this indicates depletion of kidney water. The ancient method uses formulas like Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to address this, which is indeed appropriate. However, from my observation, it is also necessary to distinguish between cold and heat, slick and turbid, and to treat them accordingly, so as to achieve the best outcome."},{"anchor":"trans-88p","marker":"88p","type":"translation","text":"If there is turbid urine like mucus, accompanied by heat and fire, it is advisable to supplement and also clear.

If there is downward leakage and accompanying difficulty in urination, it is necessary to supplement and facilitate, primarily using formulas like Liuwei Dihuang Wan. If there is turbid urine in the lower burner with no fire, it is due to the inability of qi to contain essence, and one should focus on strengthening water and nourishing qi, using formulas like Zuo Gui Yin or Dabu Yuan Jian. If fire diminishes and cannot transform qi, and qi deficiency cannot transform fluids, one should still use formulas like You Gui Yin, You Gui Wan, or Bamei Dihuang Wan. If there is no fire in the lower burner but there is slippage, the main focus should be on consolidating the kidneys and supplementing yin, using formulas like Miyuan Jian, Gu Yin Jian, and Qinzhu Tusi Wan. Regarding the three types of excesses, ancients categorized the upper burner with the lungs, the middle burner with the stomach, and the lower burner with the kidneys, often treating primarily with fire, which is indeed appropriate.

When there is a deficiency of water, it can certainly cause consumption and thirst; similarly, when there is a deficiency of fire, it can also lead to consumption and thirst. Why is this the case? It is because when water fails to support fire, fire cannot return to its source. Therefore, fire may wander to the lungs causing upper consumption, or to the stomach causing middle consumption, or it may consume the essence of yin causing lower consumption. These are all manifestations of true yin deficiency and indicate that water is insufficient, leading to consumption. Moreover, when yang fails to transform qi, water essence cannot be distributed. Water without fire cannot rise but only descend, resulting in direct entry into the bladder causing scanty urination, leading to a depletion of the springs and desiccation of the earth. This too is a manifestation of true yang deficiency, indicative of downwards fire deficiency causing consumption. For yin deficiency-based consumption, treatment should focus on nourishing water, as has been advised by many. However, when it comes to yang deficiency-induced consumption, people often doubt the need to replenish fire. They do not realize that adding fuel beneath a cauldron enhances the steam, that dried grains gain life from rain, and that growth returns to the peaks—these are all the workings of yang energy and represent subtle balances of life and death. Because consumption signs are often due to deficiency and cannot withstand excessive depletion, if one does not seek the root causes of this depletion and continues to drain the vital energy, the consumption will worsen and recovery will be impossible.

I possess a particularly remarkable formula called \"Combined Treatment Decoction.\" It consists of three taels of cooked Rehmannia, two taels each of Cornelian cherry and Ophiopogon, five qian of Plantago seeds, and one tael of Yuanshen, boiled in water and consumed daily. This will naturally cure the three types of diabetes. This formula nourishes the kidneys while also addressing excess heat. It seems suitable for those with kidney fire, but one must understand that the symptoms of diabetes cannot materialize without a fire element. I replenish water while reducing fire, allowing the excess heat to exit through the bladder while the true energy remains intact, making recovery from diabetes easier. Why complicate matters by adding more herbs like cinnamon? However, for those who have suffered long-term from diabetes and experience extreme cold in the lower body, this formula may include an additional two qian of cinnamon, if such an abnormal condition arises. If one does not follow my proportions and recklessly adjusts the ingredients, it will lead to swift death—how can one hope for survival? The symptoms of diabetes, although classified into upper, middle, and lower categories, ultimately reflect an insufficiency of kidney water. If one uses fire-clearing and thirst-quenching medications, it will further deplete the yin, inevitably augmenting the fire, which could lead to severe thirst and death. The treatment must focus on replenishing the water within the kidneys; sufficient water will naturally extinguish the fire.

Although your efforts may be in vain, we will have no regrets.\" I replied: \"The condition called diabetes has many names: it is called ‘excessive thirst,’ ‘digestive wasting,’ or ‘exhaustion disease.’ This is caused by an indulgent diet. The yangming transforms into dry fire, which prevents bodily fluids from maintaining, leading to spontaneous sweating and frequent urination. Therefore, drinking leads to urination more than once. Stomach heat causes food to be improperly digested, leading to hunger despite eating, and resulting in weight loss. Shuhe mentions that excessive eating can also cause weakness, which is true. This condition is what Zhongjing referred to as 'severe in spring and summer, mild in autumn and winter,' indicating the influence of seasonal changes. Your father is currently worsening as the seasons change, with kidney water depleted and unable to control the excessive heat of the heart at a time of its strength. The classic texts state: 'When one cannot control what is usually stronger, it’s called true excess, indicating loneliness of yang without yin.' Furthermore, a person is the master of their body while external forces are temporary guests; this severe winter cannot suppress internal heat. How can any medicine help?
